ClltS Steel Like Butter! This modern flame-cutting equipment, in use at U. S. Steel
Supply Division warehouses, can follow the most complicated patterns accurately and turn
out finished shapes of steel exactly as wanted. Many fabricators of steel products buy their
steel from U. S. Steel Supply, and have it cut to shape before it is delivered to them.

heats big steel ingots like this
up to forging temperature at
U.S. Steel's Homestead Works.
But proper heating involves a
great deal of skill and experi-
ence on the part of the men who
supervise the process. And U.S.
Steel Forgings Division crafts-
men are second to none in ex-
pertness at their various jobs.
Many of them learned their
skill from fathers and grand-
fathers who held the same jobs
before them.

Vice-President in charge of Manufacturing Staff, General Motors Corporation
Presented at College Industry Conference,
Relations with Industry Division, ASEE, De-
troit, January 16, 1954.
Reprinted from ASEE's journal of Engi-
neering, May, 1954.
A young engineer's first five years after
college are, in most cases, rather long
ones. As I recall it, they were for me,
and I presume that I had all the problems
which confront today's young engineers.
Perhaps, like others today, I even went so
far as to borrow home problems which
did not exist. The pay in 1918 at Fisher
Body for a young college graduate was
thirty cents an hour, and while that was
only equivalent to six hamburgers, I
should say that in those days a hamburger
came more nearly being a satisfying meal
than does its namesake today. We worked
hard and dreamed large dreams in those
days just as young men do today. Simi-
larly, we were concerned about such
things as our financial progress on the
job, our opportunity for advancement, our
doubts as to whether our work was fully
appreciated, and what we could do to
better equip ourselves for tomorrow's
hoped-for opportunity. I am sure that
these or related problems are burdening
the young engineer today.
To you as technically-minded men, my
message may be disappointingly non-
technical, yet this is the chance I take. I
hold a great appreciation for each of the
three fields which you represent but, with
your permission, I would like to broaden
the conventional definitions which each
of you may hold for your callings or
offices.
We generally think of engineers as ex-
ercising ingenuity in the design of things.
I would like to extend the meaning be-
yond the "design of things" to include
"the design of living."
We think conventionally of technical
societies as existing primarily as a focal
gathering point for those having a com-
munity of interest in a technology and
for the dissemination of information with
respect to that interest. Considering that
such a group is in itself a segment of so-
ciety and thus is made up in its member-
ship of men and women with singleness
of purpose, I would broaden the objec-
tives of a technical society to include the
techniques of better human relations.
Engineering educators are convention-
ally and properly thought of as learned
folks shouldering the heavy responsibility
of shaping young minds and instilling in
their students the maximum of funda-
mental technical knowledge. I would like
to lay down the challenge that engineer-
ing educators have the priceless oppor-
tunity of also helping the engineering
student to shore up the crucible in which
that knowledge is contained. Knowledge
to be useful must be in the mind of a
person of sound character or that knowl-
edge might someday be wasted or mis-
used.
Since I've warned you that my message
will be non-technical, I'd like to tell you
about a recent athletic event which took
place at Briggs Stadium, Detroit. It is the
home of our Baseball Tigers in summer
and our Football Lions in the fall. Be-
tween Christmas and New Year's, an im-
portant athletic event took place there.
The Cleveland Browns, champions of the
Eastern Division of the National Football
Conference, engaged our Detroit Lions,
champions of the West. The two teams
were evenly matched. Either could have
been victorious or the contest could have
ended in a tie and everyone, including
the fans perhaps, would have been satis-
fied. A few days prior to the game, the
quarterback and leader of the Cleveland
Browns made a very significant statement
to the press. This great team leader, Otto
Graham, said that the league champion-
ship would be decided on the basis of
"mental fitness." Translate "mental fit-
ness" any way you wish and it adds up to
a wholesome attitude—in this case, a
wholesome attitude toward the job of
winning a game.
From the spectators' standpoint, the
game was a thriller and the championship
was won by the slim margin of a point
after touchdown, and I am sure that none
of us in the stands would have wanted
to shoulder Doak Walker's responsibility
in kicking that all-important Detroit
point, but he approached the job with a
determination borne of right attitude.
Former President Theodore Roosevelt,
a man who goes down in history as hav-
ing a great depth of human understand-
ing, left his permanent mark on our coun-
try. He left a nation proud of its own
natural resources and a nation which had
the righteous respect of an entire family
of nations. He also left this significant ac-
count of his efforts as recorded by writer
David Guy Powers.* Theodore Roosevelt
said:
I stood out for my opinion alone. My own
conscience, my own judgments were to decide
all things. I would listen to no arguments, no
advice. Finally, I learned that the things I
wanted to do, I was powerless to accomplish.
What did I do? I looked the ground over and
made up my mind that there were several ex-
cellent people with honest opinions even
though they differed with me. I turned in to
help them and they turned to and gave me a
hand, and so we were able to get things done.
We did not agree on all things but we did on
some and those we pulled at together.
You who are participants or guests at
this conference know about the give and
take of a meeting. You, too, may have
had your individual differences during the
day but I'm sure that you agree on the
value of achieving the goal which has
brought us together. In a way, the very
fact that you have appeared here today
indicates that you have a wholesome at-
titude toward the task. You recognize that
a problem exists and are giving of your-
selves to help arrive at a solution.
There is much in common among
Otto Graham—the football quarterback—
Theodore Roosevelt—the man who spoke
softly more than he used the big stick—
and you who are gathered here today.
Otto Graham talked essentially about a
wholesome attitude toward the job at
hand—which in this case was the winning
of a professional football game. Teddy
Roosevelt spoke frankly about how he
arrived at a wholesome attitude toward
people. You who have come here to give
of yourselves for the advancement of a
worthy cause have exhibited a wholesome
attitude toward living.
Successful Accomplishment
All action stems from our will to per-
form the action. The will grows from an
idea which is allowed to develop or is
extinguished by our judgment. If our
judgment permits the idea to move to the
stage of our determining to do something
about it, the action is tempered by an elu-

by CHARLES A. STICKELS, Chem. and Met. '56
Last summer, shortly after the spring
semester ended, the Michigan campus was
host to the First International Nuclear
Engineering Congress. Co-sponsored by
the American Institute of Chemical Engi-
neers and the University, this conference
marked a milestone—this was the first or-
ganized, well-advertised attempt to take
what has been learned about nuclear tech-
nology out of the wraps of secrecy and
into the forum. It was a promising start
toward the free interchange of ideas and
discoveries which will be necessary before
widespread industrial application of nu-
clear energy is possible.
Several years ago the A.I.Ch.E. estab-
lished a Nuclear Energy Committee and
last December this group was organized
into the Nuclear Engineering Division of
A.I.Ch.E. Under the chairmanship of
Professor Donald L. Katz, head of Michi-
gan's Chemical Engineering Department,
this group now has over 800 members, the
majority not chemical engineers. It was
this group and the Congress on Nuclear
Engineering who, with the support
of the University (and the particular
labors of the Chemical Engineering De-
partment), planned and brought the con-
ference off successfully.
The Congress was attended by more
than 1000 persons, some 117 from for-
eign countries. Over 100 papers were pre-
sented on topics ranging from "Thorium
Metallurgy" and "The Role of Exponen-
tial Experiments in Reactor Design" to
"The Impact of Nuclear Energy on Re-
ligious Thought." The various technical
sessions considered such problems as Re-
search and Educational Reactors, Mater-
ials of Reactor Construction, Heat Trans-
fer and Fluid Flow in Reactors, Reactor
Fuel Refining and Preparation, Reactor
Statics and Kinetics, The Application of
Materials in Reactor Systems, Separations
Technology, Applications and Uses of
Radioactive Products, The Social Impact
of Nuclear Energy, and Nuclear Power
Reactors.
Following, from a sumary which ap-
peared in the A.I.Ch.E. journal "Chemi-
cal Engineering Progress," are some of
the interesting ideas aired at the Congress.
One of the pet peeves of would-be nu-
clear engineers is the tight security re-
strictions on information concerning re-
actors and reactor technology. Perhaps

of visiting firemen.
the most vehement remarks on the sub-
ject came from newspaper publisher Paul
Block, Jr. who said, "the Japanese fisher-
men know far more about an H-bomb
explosion than do I . . .". He went on
to say that the trend of judging most dis-
coveries as having military potential, a
mistake that has been made before in
history by overmilitary conscious govern-
ments, was certain to impede the very
result we need: practical, operating plants.
Other speakers also denounced the pres-
ent policy of the A.E.C., L. V. Berkner,
President of the Associated Universities,
Inc. said, "The absence of such (scientific
weapons—such as radar—in the early
stages of the last war) is directly attribut-
able to the technological delays resulting
from secrecy. Had airborne radar been
developed and advertised openly, the con-
sequent great progress in these develop-
ments might have so weakened the Ger-
man confidence in their submarine su-
premacy, or in their capabilities for
strategic air attack, that the war might
have been prevented altogether . . .".
Further words on the subject came
from C. E. Larson, Director of the Oak
Ridge National Laboratory, who credited
discoveries in the nonnuclear field with
making such nuclear success as we have
had possible. He praised President Eisen-
hower's attitude toward security regula-
tions and said, "It is to be fervently hoped
that this meeting will serve to ignite a
chain reaction of cooperation among the
scientists of the world and may serve as
a rallying point for the extension of his
(President Eisenhower's) spirit to other
areas of human endeavor which will re-
sult in progress toward that goal of mu-
tual understanding and cooperation which
is the prelude to a peaceful world."
Gordon Dean, former chairman of the
A.E.C., predicted that the Atomic Energy
Act of 1946 would be liberalized. "It
was," he said, "written at a time when we
thought we had a monopoly . . . We
should have known better; but at least
the men who wrote these provisions
12

with our allies) into the law felt that
such measures would delay the time when
a potential aggressor would get the
bomb . . . Perhaps they did albeit it
slightly . . .".
Dean endorsed the Administration's ef-
forts towards revision of the law and
called for a program that would (1) con-
tinue stockpiling atomic weapons at a
greater pace than Russia's (2) de-classify
information in the nonweapons area, and
(3) make possible a bold interchange of
information and materials pertaining to
the peaceful uses of atomic energy.
The A.E.C.'s viewpoint in security mat-
ters was outlined by Morse Salisbury, di-
rector of A.E.C. information services.
How does one judge, he asked, when a
piece of information is or is not in the
weapons category? Salisbury pointed out
that if we were sure that "there would
be no war for 30 years, virtually all
secrecy could be abandoned." But on the
other hand, "If it were to be next year
there should be virtually complete secrecy.
A clear solution to this dilemma would
only be possible if it were known exactly
when the U. S. might have to defend it-
self in another war."
The remainder of the A.E.C.'s position
was rounded out by the director of classi-
fication for the A.E.C, Mr. J. G. Becker-
ley. In concluding his remarks he said,
"I recognize that limiting atomic energy
to purely weapons information is a mat-
ter for future action. There will need to
be considerable public discussion and
possibly some Congressional action before
the Commission could undertake such a

program. However, I should like to pre-
dict that, just as it is inevitable that com-
petative nuclear power will be developed,
so it is inevitable that peacetime non-
weapons technical information will in

time be essentially completely unclassi-
fied."
An attitude somewhat in conflict with
this sentiment was expressed, however,
by Salisbury in reply to a question from
the floor concerning the Administration's
philosophy on publicity about peacetime
nuclear-power applications. His answer
was that nuclear-power reactors are rapid-
ly coming to be regarded as an "element
of strategy of the cold war . . . That is to
say, the nation which leads the way into
practical demonstrations of nuclear power
has gained for itself in the spectrum of
world opinion considerable advantage. It
enjoys a much more favorable climate of
opinion among the nations that are on the
teeter totter than the nations which have
fallen behind in the race."
Much of the above discussion took place
at three meetings organized in conjunc-
tion with the Journalism Department's
Mass Communications Conference on Nu-
clear Energy Developments which was
being held at the same time. The journal-
ists and the nuclear engineers wrangled
at two evening panel discussions which

The following activities at the U. of M.
have been selected as being of most in-
terest to engineering students. Participa-
tion in any of them will make you new
friends, give you hours of fun (and hard
work), help you in college and in later
life. Extra-curricular activities are regard-
ed very highly by business and educational
leaders, so don't see if you have time, but
make time for at least one of them.
American Foundrymen's Society
The American Foundrymen's Society
chapter at Michigan provides many ser-
vices to the student in addition to the
usual field trips, technical and social meet-
ings, and faculty counseling offered by an
engineering society. The foundry indus-
try is the fourth largest in the state, and
members of the industry have worked
with the faculty to provide an extremely
active program of scholarship assistance
and professional work in the Cast Metals
Laboratory. The student A. F. S. member
is invited to active participation with both
technical and financial leaders of the
industry in common meetings such as the
coming Michigan Regional A. F. S. ses-
sions at Ann Arbor. The contracts estab-
lished in this way at Michigan have led
to rapid advancement for many recent
graduates. It is of particular interest that
demand for engineers of all types has in-
creased more rapidly in this field than in
many of the older fields. Won't you visit
us at the Cast Metals Laboratory to ex-
plore these opportunities for yourself?
A.I.Ch.E.
First of the professional engineering
societies to establish a student chapter at
the University of Michigan was the Amer-
ican Institute of Chemical Engineers. Our
A.I.Ch.E. student chapter, since its found-
ing in 1922, has done much to supple-
ment the classroom education of its
members. While plant trips, movies of in-
dustries, and speakers representing differ-
ent industries have contributed a major
portion of this supplementary education,
the exchange of knowledge and experi-
ence within its own ranks has played no
small part. In the A.I.Ch.E. the sopho-
more chemical engineer will meet gradu-
ate students or upper classmen who have
faced the same difficulties he must face
and who can therefore solve many of his
problems.
Compiled by SHELLY LEVIN
The A.I.Ch.E. also endeavors to bring
students and faculty closer together so
that classroom student-professor acquaint-
ances might develop into close friend-
ships. This purpose is accomplished by
mixers, and by inviting the faculty to
contribute to the meetings.
Most of a semester's activity centers
about two plant trips, eight evening meet-
ings (with movies and/or speaker, and
refreshments), and fifteen weekly lunch-
eons (with movies). The chapter is plan-
ning an active program for the coming
year that will be attractive to all students
enrolled in chemical and metallurgical
engineering. We hope that you will con-
tact our secretary ((Don Giller, ext. 838,
South Quadrangle) for an A.I.Ch.E.
membership, and take advantage of our
program.
AIEE-IRE, Student Branch
Our organization is unique in that we
have two national societies sponsoring
our group—The American Institute of
Electrical Engineers and the Institute of
Radio Engineers. The AIEE is more di-
rected at the power field of Electrical
Engineering whereas the IRE is concen-
trated on the electronic and communica-
tions field.
The student branch was organized so
that students would become more familiar
with these professional societies and learn
the advantages of membership after grad-
uation. We of the student organization
also sponsor activities to help round out
the students education. First, at our meet-
ings, we invite some of the outstanding
electrical engineers as guest speakers to
give us informal talks on topics such as
colored television, power plant develop-
ment, and radar. Second, we sponsor field
trips to places such as Bell Telephone,
Consumer's Power, and plants manufac-
turing electrical equipment. Third, we
sponsor meetings of the freshman- sopho-
more, junior, and senior classes with the
faculty to discuss problems and answer
any question that the class may have.
Fourth, at the end of every school year
we wind up our activities with a banquet
attended by students and faculty.
If interested in joining the organization
just come to any of our meetings. Notices
of time and place appear on our bulletin
board between rooms 2500 and 2502 and
on the blackboards in the South Wing of
the East Engineering Building. We wish
to welcome all EE and future EE students
to join us in what should be a very sue-
cessful year. Alfred p £wert
Chairman AIEE-IRE
A.S.M.E.
The A.S.M.E. is an organization of me-
chanical and industrial engineers. Activi-
ties usually include field trips, lectures,
and social meetings such as steak roasts.
Field trips last semester included tours of
Carboloy, Detroit Edison, and Great
Lakes Steel. Oil lubrication, power trans-
mission machines and bearings were dis-
cussed at some of the meetings. All fresh-
men are welcome to join, there is much
they could learn especially from the field
trips which would apply in their classes.
Upon graduation the student member-
ship can be transferred to a junior mem-
bership, eliminating the initiation fee.
Those students with national membership
also receive the organization's monthly
magazine. Those wishing to become mem-
bers should contact the president, Bill
Somers, or the secretary Carley Meikle.
American Society of Tool Engineers
The A.S.T.E. is a group of engineers
primarily interested in the tools and ma-
chines of modern production. The mem-
bers of the student branch of this society
are for the most part, therefore, in the
production option of the industrial engi-
neering program, although any engineer-
ing student with an interest in this field is
eligible and welcome to join. Having the
distinction of being the first student
group to be chartered by the national or-
ganization, the U. of M. chapter is never-
theless a relative newcomer to the engine
school scene, being not yet two years old.
Its activities belie its age, however: on the
program for this year are plant tours to
General Electric's Carboloy Division, Ford
Motor Company's Transmission plant,
Burroughs Corporation, and the new Gen-
eral Motors Engineering center; several
well-known men from industry have been
invited to campus to talk to the group on
specialized technical aspects of tool engi-
neering; and one social function each se-
mester rounds out the agenda of society
activities.
The Engineering Council
The new Engineering Council, just re-
14
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


tee, has the general purpose of represent-
ing all of the students in the College of
Engineering. Before starting the Engineer-
ing Council, the various societies and or-
ganizations within the College functioned
as individual groups. The new Engineer-
ing Council seeks to bring representatives
of these societies and organizations to-
gether in a unified council, such that their
activities can be coordinated for the gen-
eral good of the Engineering College.
Also, the general need for representation
of all the students within the college has
been lacking for some time, and to meet
this need the Engineering Council has
been formed.
Some of the basic purposes of the
Council, set forth in the Preamble to the
Constitution, are: "to coordinate the ac-
tivities of organizations and groups," "to
provide a liaison between the student
body and the faculty," and "to stimulate
interest in the student activities." All of
the purposes are connected with the activi-
ties of the College of Engineering. To
provide a representative council, so that
these organizations can be dealt with di-
rectly, the President and Charimen of the
following groups are members of the
Council: A.S.C.E., A.S.M.E., A.I.E.E.-
I RE., A.S.T.E., A.ICh.E., I.A.S., A.F.S.,
Tau Beta Pi, Quarterdeck, Freshman
Council, Honor Council, The Technic,
and the Senior Class. Also, five members-
at-large, representing the many students
not organized in various organizations,
are appointed to the Council by the auto-
matic members. It is hoped that the Engi-
neering Council will have the support of
the student body, for only through their
support can this Engineering Council be
a success.
Eta Kappa Nu
Eta Kappa Nu is the national electrical
engineering honor society. The Beta-Epsi-
lon chapter of this association is located at
the University of Michigan.
"That those in the profesion of electri-
cal engineering, who, by their attainments
in college or in practice, have manifested
a deep interest and marked ability in their
chosen life work, may be brought into
closer union whereby mutual benefit may
b? derived," is the purpose of Eta Kappa
Nu as stated in the preamble of the con-
stitution.
In furthering this purpose, the mem-
bers of the college chapters try to help
themselves and their fellow students by
departmental and campus activities.
Among many others these include: Col-
laborate with AIEE and IRE Student
Branches in making meetings thereof
interesting and instructive. Maintain an
alumni file. Take an active part in the
Engineering Open House and the Slide
Rule Ball. Nationally, the Association
periodically undertakes a salary survey of
its members. It recognizes the Most Out-
standing Young Electrical Engineer of
each year.
For a junior to be eligible for election
he must be in the upper fourth of his
EE class; for a senior in the upper third.
All must have acceptable character and
show marked ability and personality.
There is no discrimination as to sex, race
or creed and/or membership in or affi-
liation with other recognized societies.
Freshman Engineering Council
The Freshman Engineering Council is
one of the first organizations the incom-
ing Freshman will become acquainted
with. This council is a representative
group of Freshman Engineers who have
the general purpose of meeting any of
the problems of the Freshman Class and
of presenting any problems which can be
best handled by the newly formed Engi-
neering Council. The Council members
have excellent opportunities to report di-
rectly to the Freshman students through
the Freshman Assembly Program.
There are nine members on the Coun-
cil, seven first semester Freshman and two
second semester Freshman. The three offi-
cers, President, Vice-President, and Secre-
tary are elected by the Council members
at a meeting early in the semester; their
term of office is one semester. The Presi-
dent of the Council is a representative on
the Engineering Council, which means
better cooperation and scheduling of
events can be made by the work of these
two councils.
An idea of the activities of the Council
can be seen by reviewing the activities
for the past Council, 1953-54. The Coun-
cil members acted as guides in the open-
ing of the Cooley Memorial Building, be-
sides getting additional help through the
Freshman students to fill ushering duties
during the Engineering Centennial of
1953. Committees to work on the Engi-
neering College Night, questionnaire
forms for Assembly programs, and elec-
tions of a new Sophomore Council were
formed. In addition, a representative of
the Council aided the Steering Commit-
tee in writing the Constitution for the
new Engineering Council.
The Freshman Engineering students
have the chance to organize and take part

Institute of Aeronautical Science
The Institute of Aeronautical Sciences
is the officially recognized aeronautical
engineering society in the United States.
Its membership includes prominent engi-
neers in all phases of aeronautical re-
search, design and production.
The organization of I.A.S. is composed
of Technical Branches located in all parts
of the country where aeronautical research
and production facilities exist. Contribut-
ing continually to these Technical
Branches are the Student Branches located
at universities and technical schools
throughout the country.
The University of Michigan Student
Branch of I.A.S. was organized by stu-
dents who believe that only through such
a technical association can they best gain
the broad aeronautical knowledge so im-
portant to the beginning engineer. After
graduation these student members con-
tinue on into Technical Membership ranks
so they can continue to benefit through
this broad association.
Throughout the year the programs of
the Michigan Student Branch include
group meetings, field trips, the faculty-
student picnic, and the annual technical
paper competition. Branch meetings are
scheduled each month, usually in the
evenings. The programs consist of a short
business meeting followed by movies or
lectures of academic interest designed to
bring the student in closer contact with
aeronautical research and design activities.
A still closer contact is gained by field
trips to research and production facilities
such as Wright Field and manufactures in
the Michigan area.
Each spring the Michigan Student
Branch of I.A.S. chooses a paper, pre-
pared by one of its members, to represent
the branch in the technical paper compe-
tition between the University of Michi-
gan, Wayne University, University of De-
troit, and Lawrence Institute of Technol-
ogy. The student presents his own paper
at a joint meeting of the four chapters
and the winner is presented with a gen-
erous award.
The I.A.S. is getting off to an early
start on programs for the coming school
year. The program for the first semester
starts with an organizational meeting late
in September and will continue up to a
few weeks before final exams. All stu-
dents interested in both contributing and

Agree on Electrical Symbols
Delegates from eleven countries reach-
ed preliminary agreements on letter sym-
bols used in connection with electricity
at a meeting held September 2 and 3. The
delegations were members of Technical
Committee 25 of the International Elec-
trotechnical Commission. The committee
met during the Fiftieth Anniversary cele-
bration of the International Electrotechni-
cal Commision at Philadelphia (Septem-
ber 1-16),
Preliminary agreements were reached
on letter symbols in the new fields of
electronics and telecommunications as well
as on detailed problems concerned with
notation for vectors and phasors, and for
instantaneous, root-mean-square and peak
values.
Earlier editions of the international
electrical symbols, published in 1911 and
again in 1920, have brought about
world-wide use of such symbols as for in-
stance, "I" for current (originally this
refered to "intensity of current") and
"R" for resistance.
Countries represented at the September
meeting of Technical Committee 25 were
Belgium, France, Germany, Israel, Italy,
Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, United
Kingdom, Yugoslavia, USA.
M. K. Landolt, Assistant Manager,
Oerlikon Engineering Company, Zurich,
Switzerland, was chairman of the meet-
ing. H. P. Westman, Editor, "Electrical
Communications," International Tele-
phone and Telegraph Corporation, New
York, was secretary.
New Silicon Polymer
Rubbery parts with properties interme-
diate between those of silicone rubber and
organic rubbers can now be produced by
compounding with a new silicone poly-
mer that can be vulcanized with sulfur
and blended in any proportion with or-
ganic rubbers.
Identified as Dow Corning 410 Gum
and available now in commercial quan-
tities, this new polymer can be blended
with or applied as a protective coating to
extend the serviceable temperature limits
and the weather resistance of organic-
rubbers. Brittle points in the range of
— 70°F and usefulness at temperatures up
to 400°F can be realized by proper blend-
C'reUlt: Dow-Cornlns
The bond between straight butyl and
compounded Dow Corning 410 Gum de-
velops a tensile strength equal to that of
the silicone component after press vul-
canizing for only 20 minutes at 320 de-
grees F.
ing. The physical properties of the blend
will fill between those of high strength
silicon rubber and the organic rubber con-
stituent.
Dow Corning 410 Gum can also be
blended with oil resistant rubbers to in-
crease their stability in contact with hot
oil. Such blending also markedly improves
the ozone and weather resistance of or-
ganic rubber.
Treated in an atmosphere created by an
ozone generator, for example, a Buna N
type rubber, compounded for test pur-
poses, showed failure cracks in less than
30 minutes. Under the same conditions,
a fifty-fifty blend of the same organic
elastomer and Dow Corning 410 Gum,
compounded with the same fillers and
vulcanizer showed no cracks after more
than 8 hours.
Priced in the same range as standard
silicone rubber gums, Dow Corning 410
Gum is currently available for immediate
shipment in commercial quantities. Ex-
perimental samples for testing and eval-
uation are available on request.
Bausch &amp; Lomb Announces New
Combination colorlmeter-
Spectrophotometer
A combination colorimeter and spec-
trophotometer which produces high wave-
length accuracy and special purity through
use of a digraction grating was announced
recently by the Bausch &amp; Lomb Optical
Co., Rochester, N.Y.
Called the Spectronic 20 because of its
20mmu band pass, the instrument is de-
signed for speedy, simple operation by
laboratory technicians who need use only
two control knobs in making routine
colorimetric analyses.
It also offers flexibility and a high de-
gree of accuracy to research and quality
control people concerned with the more
complex analyses of spectrophotometry,
the company said.
An illustrated brochure, Catalog D-266,
describing the instrument in detail, is
available by writing Bausch &amp; Lomb, 635
St. Paul Street, Rochester, N.Y.
The Spectronic 20 analyzes any liquids
or solids which transmit light by subject-
ing a sample to light of specified wave-
lengths. The degree of light transmittance
is registered on a double scale, where
readings may be taken in terms of either
transmittance or optical density.
The operator can adjust the diffraction
grating for any wavelength in the entire
range of the instrument by turning a con-
trol knob, without being limited to avail-
able filters.
Effective range is from 375mmu (near
ultra-violet) to 950mmu (near infra-
red), according to the company.
For the range from 650mmu to 950
mmu, an infra-red tube and filer are
quickly substituted for the standard tube.
As a colorimeter, the instrument makes
possible quick routine tests by subjecting

trophotometer.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Resulting readings can be readily inter-
preted as concentration values from pre-
determined calibrations supplied with the
instrument.
More intensive study is possible by
using the instrument as a spectrophoto-
meter. Here the sample is subjected to
light of the desired wavelengths to get
transmittance and density readings for
interpretative analysis and the construc-
tion of transmission and/or absorption
curves.
Basic components are a built-in grating
monochromator; a photoemissive detec-
tor to pick up the light which passes
through the sample and transmit it in the
form of photo-electric current; and a
printed-circuit electronic amplifying sys-
tem to build up the current so it will
register on the scale.
To eliminate vibration problems and
insure accuracy of readings, a rigid, die-
cast base is used, together with a one-piece
housing.
Eastman Kodak Unveils Heat-Sensing
Cell with 10,000-Time Sensitivity Boost
Little slips of glass coated with lead
sulfide that can give 10,000 times as much
sensitivity to certain infrared rays as prev-
ious laboratory instruments, have now
been put on sale to science and industry
by the Eastman Kodak Company.
Known as Kodak Ektron Detectors, the
new photoconductive cells were first un-
veiled at the convention of the American
Society for Testing Materials. The com-
pany believes that the extreme infrared
sensitivity of the cells, coupled with their
simplicity and adaptability to manufacture
in any size or shape, open wide new pos-
sibilities to engineers in developing new
devices based on the ability to detect
warm objects without physical contact and
over long distances.
Announcement of the availability of
the Ektron Detectors culminates a decade
of research by a team of Kodak scientists
under Dr. G. W. Hammar. Though the
cell reaches its peak of sensitivity in the
invisible heat rays of the near-infrared, it
is highly sensitive to all colors of visible
light and on into the untraviolet.
As a demonstration of the new cell,
Kodak representatives have been exhibit-
ing a small box that emitted squeals,
whenever the Ektron Detector on it "saw"
the bit of hot ash on the end of a cigar-
ette. It also squealed loudly when a flash-

pany are contained on a bit of glass

themselves.
light was pointed at it with battery cells
so weak that the lamp filament scarcely
glowed.
In addition to its possibilities for heat
detection devices and for the replacement
of present types of "electric eyes" in
rough-service applications, the Kodak
company also sees a strong potential for
Ektron Detectors in automatic control of
chemical processing plant operations and
in complex electrical equipment where
mechanical switching devices are too
bulky, impractical, or insufficiently re-
liable.
In the chemical plant applications, the
cells could automatically monitor the ex-
act composition of fluids flowing through
pipes and process vessels on the basis of
the characteristic infrared "color" of the
various components. Water and gasoline,
for example, are both colorless liquids to
the human eye but look entirely different
to a sensitive infrared detector. Very fine
differences between chemicals can be de-
tected in this way.
In the switch applications, say the
Kodak engineers, the Ektron Detector
permits a beam of light to eliminate a
moving part. The "light", they point out,
can come from a lamp operated so far
below the rated current that the glow is
invisible and lamp life is therefore un-
limited. Ektron Detectors were shown
at the convention June 14 in the form
of multiple arrays of as many as 20
pinpoint specks of lead sulfide on less
than an inch of glass. These are intended
to operate complex combinations of elec-
trical circuits in response to projected
patterns of light or heat radiation.

by NANCY FARRELL, '57Ch.E.
Since the introduction of the telephone
into our daily lives, great progress has and
is continuing to be made in this mode of
communication. Through research and ex-
perimentation, the telephone has become
one of the greatest conveniences and neces-
sitis in our lives. The continual aim, "De-
sign for Performance," has been one of
the main objectives of the Bell Telephone
System in order to give the telephone the
essential role which it plays in our in-
tricate society.
By "Design for Performance" is meant
the process of determining the perform-
ance characteristics to be striven for, then
developing systematically the means for
meeting them and embodying these means
in a suitable operating design. These per-
formance objectives are best taken in the
likelihood of their achievement. In the
early era of the telephone experiment the
dominant fact in development and ad-
vancement in performance was largely
expressed in terms of the modification
which was tested. The results of this early
era began to have their effect of the de-
sign of commercial telephone instruments
about twenty-five years ago. Though the
idea of the handset goes back to the early
days of the telephone it was not found
out until the middle of the 1920's how
to get, in the instruments on the handset,
service performance comparable to that
afforded by the available instruments
when supported and separated as they
were in the wall set and the deskstand
set. There were two important limitations
in achieving this result-—one, the so-
called howling resulting from the coup-
ling between the diaphragm of the trans-
mitter and the diaphragm of the receiver;
and the other, the degradation of the per-
formance of the granular carbon trans-
mitter with position. The importance of
the amplification provided by this granu-
lar carbon on the design of the telephone
is stressed and it was the magnitude of
this amplification and resonance in the
instrument that caused the howling diffi-
culty in the handset. With such instru-
ments directly coupled mechanically, the
howling difficulty was hard to solve.
In the early twenties, in the develop-
ment of the handset which was made
available in 1927, the coupling factor be-
tween the diaphragms on the two instru-
ments was measured for a variety of pro-
posed designs of the handle; and the de-
velopment and selection of the design was
on the basis of a handle having resonance
out of the range of the instruments used
and of such materials as to provide dissi-
pation of energy in this mechanical trans-
mission path.
The other factor that made possible the
solution of this problem was the develop-
ment of a transmitter in which the vibra-
tory system was essentially free from re-
sonance and the positional effect of the
carbon chamber was materially reduced.
This transmitter—the first non-resonant
transmitter in commercial telephony—
gave a decrease in the magnitude of the
electrical output. It was demonstrated,
however, by articulation and repetition
rate tests, that the reduction in loudness
output was compensated for by the low
distortion of the reduced sounds; and
hence, the combination quality with de-
creased loudness gave a resultant intelligi-
bility in service comparable to that ob-
tained with the then available deskstand
transmitter.
The smaller receiver of the 1927 hand-
set was made to give the same perform-
ance with a much higher electrical output
than the 1927 transmitter. For the 1937
handset, the objective was set of making
the receiver also free from resonance. In
this handset the diaphragm resonance
was completely eliminated. This was a
marked improvement over the handset of
1927. In the handset of the late year the
air spaces associated with the diaphragm
were employed with an acoustic resistance
element in order to control the motion of
the diaphragm. In the 1937 receiver,
three special magnetic alloys were em-
ployed—permendur for the diaphragm,
45% permalloy for the pole pieces and
remalloy for the magnets. In the manu-
facture of these receivers, each one was
magnetized to its optimum value.
In the instruments of the telephone set
of 1950, the application of these design
procedures was carried still further. The
performance requirements for these in-
struments were set on the basis of what it
was desired to have in the way of band-
width, frequency characteristics and effi-
ciency. The instruments were then de-
veloped to attain these characteristics.
Also in the 1950 transmitter, a further
improvement was made in the granular
carbon to increase its stability with time.
For many years, extensive studies have
been made of the performance of granu-
lar carbon in the telephone transmitter in
an attempt to understand the contact ac-
tion and to determine the causes of aging
with time and use, and the means of alle-
viating these causes. From these and other
studies of the structure of the chamber
containing the carbon, have come remark-
able results in improving the perform-
ances of this very critical mass of loose
granules. It has been stated that the tele-
phone system is built around a loose con-
tact which is a thing the electrical engi-
neer hopes to avoid. The fact is that, to-
day as the result of all this work which
has been done on the use of granular car-
bon in the transmitter, little of value
would be gained in the quality of repro-
duction in commercial telephony by the
replacement of the current designs of this
simple low cost means of making the con-
version between acoustic and electrical
energy, by a combination of a passive de-
vice with a vacuum tube form of amplifi-
cation. Furthermore, the carbon trans-
mitter has been made to behave well with
respect to position, time and use.
The 1950 receiver, invented prior to
World War II, involves a radically new
structure—a receiver having a composite
diaphragm with an outer annular portion
of magnetic material and an inner circular
part of domed impregnated fabric. This
invention was stimulated by the analytical
demonstration of the benefits of a low-
diaphragm mass. The projected perform-
ance of this receiver shows the high level
which the technology of the design of
such devices has now reached. This latest
receiver is much more efficient than the
1937 design and reproduces a wider fre-
quency range. Through dropping a re-
sponse at the lower end an increase of
interference from power systems has been
avoided.
By these extensive studies in theory,
the development and application of phys-
ical and subjective measurements, and the
advanced technology of design, the pres-
ent generation of the descendants of Bell"s
transmitter and receiver approach in their

How a Vk hour ™gem-cutting operation
became an 8-minute mechanized job
PROBLEM: Preparing quartz
crystals for use as electronic
frequency controls calls for
the highest degree of preci-
sion. So much so, in fact, that prior to World
War II skilled gem-cutters were employed
to do the job.
But during the war, there were not enough
gem-cutters to keep up with the demand for
crystals in radar, military communications
and other applications.
Western Electric tackled the job of build-
ing into machines the skill and precision that
had previously called for the most highly
skilled operators.
SOLUTION: Here is how quartz crystals are
made now—by semi-skilled labor in a fraction
of the time formerly required:
A quartz stone is sliced into wafers on a
reciprocating diamond-edged saw, after de-
termination of optical and electrical axes by
means of an oil bath and an X-ray machine.
Hairline accuracy is assured by an orienting
fixture.
The wafers are cut into rectangles on ma-
chines equipped with diamond saws. The
human element is practically eliminated by
means of adjustable stops and other semi-
automatic features.
The quartz rectangles are lapped automatic-
ally to a thickness tolerance of plus or minus
.0001". A timer prevents overlapping. Finally,
edges are ground to specific length and width
dimensions on machines with fully automatic
microfeed systems.
Most of these machines were either com-
pletely or largely designed and developed by
Western Electric engineers.
RESULTS: With skill built into the machines
—with costly hand operations eliminated—
this Western Electric mechanization program
raised production of quartz crystals from a
few thousand a year to nearly a million a
month during the war years. This is just one
of the many unusual jobs undertaken and
solved by Western Electric engineers.
Quartz stones are cut into wafers on this diamond-edged saw,
with orientation to optical axis controlled by fixture. This is
just one of several types of machines designed and developed
by Western Electric engineers to mechanize quartz cutting.

attitude can grow into a fierce flame which
will determine the type or character of our
action. Our attitude is the key element. A
wholesome attitude underlies all success-
ful accomplishment.
And it is at successful accomplishment
that we aim when we discuss the engi-
neer's first five years in industry. We—
all of us—want to create a favorable
climate for the young engineer so that he
does not consider his work to be economic
drudgery necessary to make a living but
rather as an opportunity to develop and
express his latent talents. We want the
individual engineer to take maximum ad-
vantage of that climate and come to real-
ize that his attitude toward work, toward
living, and toward people will develop an
inner satisfaction through personal attain-
ment, attainment which is measured di-
rectly by the elastic limit of his abilities.
Have you ever paused to consider how
tremendously our attitude effects our ac-
tions? We associate success with great ac-
tions whether they be sudden as in battle
or on an athletic field or sustained over a
lifetime as in the case of great statesmen.
Men who translate their lives into great
actions invariably exhibit wholesome at-
titudes.
Along the highway of life, each of us
is attracted by some men of action, and
invariably we admire them for certain
personal traits. Notice how these traits are
each an attitude—ambition, cheerfulness,
confidence, courage, enthusiasm, integrity,
loyalty, perseverance, self-control, under-
standing, and vision, to name but a few.
Each of these traits associated with suc-
cess is the expression of a wholesome at-
titude toward people, toward work, or to-
ward living generally. We are free, each
of us, to assume or develop any or all of
these traits. Similarly, we are free, each of
us, to demonstrate a willingness to instill
and develop these traits in the young men
who come within the shadow of our in-
fluence.
The shadow of your influence may be
longer than you think. In many ways, our
founding fathers considered themselves
as very ordinary folks and all of us today
may look around us to see what their
sound thinking has accomplished. Sup-
pose for a moment that our founding
fathers had set up a government such as
that which has grown up behind the Iron
Curtain. Could the same material advance-
ment have been possible, even with our
EXPERIENCE TELLS ME
(Continued from page 11)
vast natural resources? History's pages are
full of examples of nations which had the
same material opportunity to prosper as
had the United States but somehow did
not achieve our benefits.
I am not one to place undue importance
on our material advantages nor to say
that anything American is necessarily the
best in the world. However, I do certainly
value and endorse the working climate of
individual initiative which made our high
living standard possible. Our founding
fathers established a nation unique on the
face of the earth because it advanced the
proposition that man gets his rights from
God and not from government. Between
man and government, man is supreme.
Man is free to make choices, good or bad.
Picture if you will the young engineer
behind the Iron Curtain who could de-
rive personal benefits from ambition,
cheerfulness, confidence, generosity, in-
tegrity, and all the rest! Our young engi-
neers—and all of us—still live under the
shadow of the influence of our founding
fathers. Our freedom gives us the right
to life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness
according to our own attitudes toward
these three elements. We are free to dem-
onstrate, live, and express our attitudes
toward good—or evil—objectives; and
our own attitudes can be very contagious.
What I've tried to point out so far is
that a wholesome attitude underlies suc-
cess in any venture and that we live in a
unique nation where a wholesome attitude
pays oft" for all of us. Let us try to apply
a wholesome attitude to the task at hand:
that of creating the right kind of climate
for the young engineer in his first five
years in industry—realizing, of course,
that the young engineer by his work and
attitudes will bear the full responsibility
for taking advantage of the opportunities
available in this climate.
Industry and Education
In the area of education first of all, let
us give honest recognition to the store of
technical knowledge which the young
man has gained on earning his baccalau-
reate degree in engineering. The knowl-
edge is of sufficient value to us in industry
so that we have completed briskly for
next June's 19,000 graduates of U. S.
engineering schools as we did for last
June's 24,000 graduates. The Scientific
Manpower Commission has indicated that
we have a need in the United States for
from 35,000 to 40,000 engineers right
now and the Commission estimates that
our needs to accomplish the nation's en-
gineering tasks will continue at a level
of about 30,000 new engineers per year
for some time.
When engineering graduates come to
us in industry, we assume a responsibility
of carrying on where engineering educa-
tors leave off. While we in industry wel-
come and seek young engineers, we recog-
nize that they are by no means finished
products. You have trained them to be-
come engineers; you were not expected to
turn them out as finished engineers. The
responsibility of undertaking further
training programs is one which we gladly
accept.
In our training programs, we have an
excellent opportunity to discuss the value
of graduate study as it might apply to
each individual and in some cases wc
could recommend to the young engineer
that he supplement his on-the-job training
with formal graduate study. In General
Motors, we operate under a policy of de-
centralized control and each operating unit
establishes its own practices. But I know
of no unit in which graduate work by
young engineers is discouraged. In fact,
we hear only of its encouragement.
Among the means taken by industry to
promote the self-development of young
engineers through graduate study pro-
grams are
(1) Reinbursement of tuition, provided
certain requirements are met.
(2) Granting of graduate scholarships to
employees.
(3) Granting to colleges and universities
graduate fellowships which are filled
by students who do not commit
themselves to become employees of
the industry which makes the grant.
Industry also promotes a closer liaison
between engineering education and their
employees through
(1) Bringing engineering professors into
their laboratories and plants for sum-
mer work.
(2) Conducting of seminars in which
professors are invited in as leaders.
(3) Conducting of conferences in which
engineering educators are invited to
a program of visits and lectures to
better acquaint them with industry's
viewpoints and to bring to industry
a greater understanding of problems
in engineering education.
(4) Sharing of technical information,

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Don Sundstrom asks:
What are my
chances for
advancement in
a big firm
like Du Pont?
Donald W. Sundstrom received his B.S. degree in Chemical Engineering from
Worcester Polytechnic Institute in 1953. He's currently studying for an M.S. degree
and expects to receive it next year. Like other engineering students, he's asking
a lot of searching questions before deciding on a permanent employer.
Jerry Risser answers.
Gerald J. Risser, B.S. Chem. Eng., Univ. of
Wisconsin (1937), is now assistant man-
ager of the Engineering Service Division
in Du Pont's Engineering Department, Wil-
mington, Delaware.
ITHINK Iknowexactly what's behind thatquestion,
Don, because the same thing crossed my mind
when I first graduated and looked around for a job.
That was about seventeen years ago, when the
Du Pont Company was much smaller than it is to-
day. And there's a large factor in the answer, Don,
right there! The advancement and growth of any
employee depends to a considerable degree on the
advancement and growth of his employer. Promo-
tion possibilities are bound to be good in an expand-
ing organization like Du Pont.
Right now, for example, construction is in prog-
ress or planned for three new plants. That means
many new opportunities for promotion for young
engineers. And, in my experience, I have found it is
a fundamental principle of Du Pont to promote
from within the organization—on merit.
My own field, development work, is a natural for
a young graduate, because it's one of the fundamental
branches of engineering at Du Pont. There are com-
plete new plants to design, novel equipment prob-
lems to work on, new processes to pioneer—all sorts
of interesting work for a man who can meet a chal-
lenge. Many of the problems will involve cost studies
—some will require evaluation in a pilot plant—but,
in every case, they'll provide the satisfactions which
come from working with people you like and respect.
All in all, Don, your chances of advancement on
merit are mighty good at Du Pont!

Two Academic Camps
At a conference for engineering educa-
tors held by General Motors last summer,
we learned that the educators arc divided
into two academic camps. One group feels
that industry has grown so complex that
it is no longer possible to specialize engi-
neering education to a sufficient degree so
that the graduate will be immediately
profitable to industry. This group urges a
return—or a continuing emphasis—on a
thorough grounding in the basic sciences.
The second group feels that a student
ought to be trained very thoroughly in
a narrow technical field so that he can be
immediately valuable in his specialty.
I have no particular preference for
either academic viewpoint, and there are
many others, both in my company and in
industry generally, who have no strong
preference either for a specialized educa-
tion or a broad scientific training. The
guests at our conference made a survey
and appointed a spokesman from their
number to summarize their findings. The
Professor, from the University of To-
ronto, said in his talk given near the end
of the 15-day conference
The answer was quite unequivocal and a
bit shocking. General Motors, judged by the
composite answers, did not fall into the arms
of either camp but marched bravely to a third
position, stuck its banner in the ground and
allowed us to see on it words emblazoned in
letters of gold; we looked at one another, for
those words didn't appear in the syllabus, the
curriculum of either camp, and these words
were thus strange to us. They were princi-
pally integrity, diligence and ability to express
one's self. Humility was one, and one or two
other qualities.
I do believe that the Professor from
Toronto used the word "shocking" to
heighten his meaning. We grew to know
him quite well during the two weeks he
was our guest. By his actions, he stood
out to us as one who in his associations
with students would definitely generate
just the kinds of wholesome attitudes
which industry desires, not only that the
employee may make his contribution to
industry but, more importantly, that he
may make life satisfying for himself and
for his family.
It is far more than my own personal
opinion that we in business and industry
EXPERIENCE TELLS ME
(Continued from page 20)
have an obligation to share with the
schools the responsibility of insuring that
our young people are educated and train-
ed for effective living in the world as it
is, and not as some of us would like to
have it. Our desire for favorable attitudes
transcends any preference which we might
have with respect to curricula, whether
they be specialized or stress the basic
sciences. It means that we think that all
young people ought to be far more con-
scious than they are of the ultimate ob-
jective of all education and training,
namely, becoming equipped to make a
satisfactory living—but more importantly
—to make a successful life.
Certainly, the college years are very im-
pressionable ones for the future engineer.
Professors and instructors have a superla-
tive opportunity while indoctrinating their
students in engineering knowledge to also
instill the less easily defined fundamentals
of effective living. In this latter task, the
best teaching tool, to my mind, is the
power of example.
Technical Societies
In this point effort of ours, technical
societies also have their opportunity to
demonstrate to the young engineer the
value of effective living as an engineer,
for these societies offer a medium whereby
the young engineer can obtain a broader
viewpoint of his particular specialty. His
society membership gives him the oppor-
tunity to hear the viewpoints of a broad
cross section of engineers in his own field
and to learn from their experiences.
I suggest here that technical societies
make sure that their younger members
have an opportunity to discuss with older
members informally and quite frequently
their areas of mutual interest. The society
should do this as a primary "bread and
butter" job; for it is quite easy for a
young engineer to gain precisely the kind
of technical information heard in lectures
simply by visiting a good technical library.
Any society also has the opportunity
through its membership to disseminate in-
formation on the technique of effective
living. And since it is a society, it also
must offer some social outlet to its mem-
bership. This enables the older members
to set the same kind of good example
which professors can set in the classroom.
Industry and the Individual
Just as the responsibilities of engineer-
ing education and industry intermingle,
so do those of industry and the individual.
As I've mentioned, engineering educators
train and develop a young man to be-
come an engineer and industry has the
responsibility of creating a climate in
which the graduate can express his train-
ing in work. His profession must not be
permitted to lapse, as some might have
it, into a simple trade wherein his pro-
ductiveness would be measured purely by
hours spent on the job (though this is
necessary) rather than by his creativeness
as a member of a proud profession.
Industry's responsibility is to create a
good climate for creative engineering. Wt
need to give due regard for the worth or
an engineering education. We need to
assure ourselves that the young engineer
gets as profitable experience and training
during his first year as does the medical
school graduate during his internship.
Further, we need to establish and main-
tain equitable policies and practices relat-
ing to salaries and promotions so that the
young engineer will have the benefit of
personal rewards commensurate with his
ability to translate his engineering knowl-
edge into work for the success, both for
the business and for himself.
On-the-job training is necessary but in-
dustry would find little success in forcing
its young graduates to continue in night
school until they obtained advanced de-
grees. That step, too, is left to the indi-
vidual initiative of the young engineer.
He must sense the advantage of further
formal education to equip him for making
a greater contribution of himself to his
company. From a practical standpoint, I
cannot see how industry can arbitrarily
set down practices which would guarantee
progress purely on the grounds of em-
ployees obtaining advanced degrees.
The young engineer, too, has a grave
responsibility in his first years. He needs
to find his own definition of successful
living and a way to derive the maximum
benefit from both his technical education
and his ability to work as a member of a
team—to lean on his colleagues and to
serve them at the same time. His atti-
tude toward them and toward his work
will determine his own success in de-
veloping his abilities to their elastic limit.
In the final analysis, the young engineer
himself has the responsibility for his own
self-development.
Now we should warn the young engi-
neer that while he might know what the

Pi Tau Sigma
What is it?
Pi Tau Sigma is a national honorary
fraternity for mechanical engineers.
Objective
The purpose of Pi Tau Sigma is to fos-
ter the high ideals of the engineering
profession, to stimulate interest in co-
ordinate departmental activities and to
develop in students of mechanical engi-
neering the attributes necessary for ef-
fective leadership and the assumption of
the responsibilities of a citizen in a de-
mocracy.
History
Pi Tau Sigma was founded at the Uni-
versity of Illinois in the spring of 1915.
In the next quarter-century, Pi Tau Sigma
extended itself the length and breadth of
the country and since the second World
War has expanded to over sixty active
chapters. The Michigan Pi Rho chapter
was installed in the fall of 1948 and has
since strengthened itself to 47 members
last spring.
Membership
As Pi Tau Sigma is an honorary organi-
zation, upperclassmen are elected to Pi
Tau Sigma on the basis of sound engi-
neering ability, scholarship and person-
ality.
Activities
Pi Tau Sigma holds bi-monthly meet-
ings of either technical, social or business
variety,- as well as picnics and outings
throughout the year. They offer their ser-
vices to the Mechanical engineering de-
partments to' be of service in any way
that they can. Pi Tau Sigma also awards
an engineering handbook to the outstand-
ing sophomore of the year, and helps in
the annual engineering open house. All
mechanical students are invited to try for
Pi Tau Sigma, for while it is a very
worthwhile organization in college, its
key links together the more than 20,000
illustrious graduates.
Quarterdeck Society
The Quarterdeck Society is the honor-
ary technical society of The Department
(Continued from page I})
of Naval Architecture and Marine Engi-
neering here at The University of Mich-
igan. It is open to all students who are
taking, or have taken at least one course
in Naval Architecture here at Michigan.
While necessarily being small due to the
enrollment in the Department of Naval
Architecture and Marine Engineering, it
is nevertheless a society which is capable
of serving a very important roll in the
education of any student interested in this
particular field. Quarterdeck also has the
distinction of being the oldest technical
society on the campus. In order to better
acquaint prospective members with the
activities of the society, a brief resume of
its history, purposes, and qualifications is
presented below.
Quarterdeck had its beginning as "The
Indoor Yacht Club" during the winter of
1905-6. The founding members were
seniors in The Department of Naval
Architecture and Marine Engineering
who had at the suggestion of Professor
Saddler formed a society to hold meetings
at which technical papers prepared by
the members were read and discussed.
From this early beginning Quarterdeck
has grown into an organization with a
home of its own in 448 West Engineer-
ing Building, and more important a very
complete file of the papers presented by
its members, many of whom now hold
prominent positions in the shipbuilding
industry and allied fields. Among its as-
sets, in addition to these papers, Quar-
terdeck can now list many technical refer-
ence books and manuals, and, due to the
very kind gift of Professor Emeritus E. M.
Bragg last fall, a complete set of The
Transactions of The Institute of Naval
Architects dating back to the early 1860's.
In recent years the best of the papers
presented have been made available in
print form so that members may have
permanent copies of those papers which
particularly interest them. These prints
number close to 100, and cover all phases
of Naval architecture and marine engi-
neering. Many of the prints are espe-
cially designed to supplement the regular
courses offered by the department and as
such play an important part in the stu-
dent's education. Others become a valu-
able part of the member's permanent ref-
erence material.
In purpose Quarterdeck has changed
very little since its beginning and I can
best quote from its constitution that its
object is "To promote interest in Naval
Architecture and Marine Engineering, to
provide opportunity for, and to encour-
age members of Quarterdeck to give and
to hear papers on topics of interest out-
side of the regular curriculum of The
Department of Naval Architecture and
Marine Engineering, and to acquaint stu-
dents of the department with the differ-
ence between theory and practice in the
shipbuilding industry."
As stated before, membership in Quar-
terdeck Society is open to all those who
are taking or have taken at least one
course in The Department of Naval Arch-
itecture and Marine Engineering. The
prospective member first becomes a pro-
bationary member by fulfilling the quali-
fications above and filing an application
for full membership. To become a full
member he must prepare, present, and
submit a paper on an approved subject
before the membership, or complete an
approved project. Projects usually consist
of making a model which is useful in
acquainting students with some phase of
the field. Several examples of these proj-
ects are the models on display in the
showcase opposite room 338 in West En-
gineering Building. Nominal annual dues
are required of all members, whether full
or probationary, and an initiation fee is
required upon election to full member-
ship.
The activities of Quarterdeck are main-
ly centered around bi-weekly meetings at
which business is transacted, papers are
presented, and an address by a guest
lecturer is heard, or a movie is shown.
Also a field trip to some nearby shipyard
is usually arranged each semester to fa-
miliarize members with actual yard con-
ditions. Lest one think there is no diver-
sion from such a steady technical diet, it
should be said that there are several
outings each semester during which any-
thing more technical than the consump-
tion of good food and drink is definitely
verboten. At the conclusion of each
semester a banquet is held at which time
all new full members receive scrolls and
The Quarterdeck pin which is the symbol
of the midship section.
Any one interested in further informa-
tion concerning Quarterdeck Society is
invited to stop in at the Quarterdeck
Room in 448 West Engineering Building,
or to contact any of the Officers who are
as follows:

Sigma Rho Tau
The growing emphasis upon the meth-
ods of applied science and the increasing
importance of the engineer in social rela-
tions have made it imperative to break
his tradition of taciturity and to develop
members of the profession who can ef-
fectively present its ideals and projects
before the general public. One means to
this end is the maintenance of an honor
society that shall stimulate interest and
adequately recognize achievement in this
field of effort.
Sigma Rho Tau is an honor society
whose members are elected from the
architectural and engineering professions
and from the upper classes and faculties
of the institutions in which chapters exist.
The main object of the organization is to
insure a closer bond of understanding
between the general public and the
members of the technical professions by
developing the latter's ability in the art
of speaking. To this end it encourages
speech activities in and among colleges of
architecture, engineering and technology.
In competition with the many enticing
and less arduous pursuits of college life,
it seeks to induce the student to spend his
leisure time in the training necessary for
the development of good speakers, by of-
fering him the prize of membership on
an equal basis with the faculty and dis-
tinguished members of the profession. It
endeavors to promote a broader sympathy
and feeling of unity by fostering the in-
terchange of ideas among those in the
various fields of specialization. Moreover,
the society proposes to offer inducement
and recognition equal to or greater than
that offered in other extra-curricular ac-
tivities. To insure a high standard of
attainment, it provides through its local
chapters opportunities for improvement
to those who become interested in the
ideals of the society. It thus seeks to se-
cure as well as to recognize high achieve-
ment in speech among members of the
architectural, engineering, and allied pro-
fessions.
Recognizing the importance of encour-
aging this endeavor in all branches of
applied science, Sigma Rho Tau elects to
membership those in every line of spec-
(Continued from page 24)
ialization, among the student body or pro-
fession, whose work on the public plat-
form has been of outstanding merit. Elec-
tion is made by a board of student and
faculty members, who review the candi-
date's record, collegiate, intercollegiate,
or professional, and whose decisions are,
in turn, subject to review by the executive
council of the organization.
Sigma Rho Tau is not a secret order. As
its constitution denotes, it is a society,
not a fraternity. It assumes neither the
functions of social fraternities of the
secret Greek letter type nor those of the
various professional or departmental fra-
ternities and honor societies of the several
colleges; nor does it interfere with the
professional societies in colleges of engi-
neering or of architecture. It is strictly
non-partisan and is social only in the
broadest sense of the term. It is truly
democratic and elects to membership any
worthy person who can meet the mental
and physical standards required. The so-
ciety confines itself strictly to the speech
problems of its members in all their
professional or social and business rela-
tions. Since it operates harmoniously with
all other honor or professional organiza-
tions, Sigma Rho Tau finds no objection
to its introduction into colleges where
such societies exist. In fact membership in
Sigma Rho Tau is now held by many of
the leading members of fraternities and
of honor or professional societies; for
Sigma Rho Tau, instead of interfering
with loyalties to other organizations, offers
a way to additional distinction both for
the individual and for his group.
Devoted to the promotion of speech
activities among colleges of architecture,
of engineering, and of technology, the so-
ciety occupies a unique position in an un-
developed field. Sigma Rho Tau has
undertaken the task of evolving a speech
platform for the applied sciences. The
neglect of such a policy has often left
the scientist without the necessary public
contacts. Members of the engineering
professions have determined to institute a
program which will provide them repre-
sentatives who will add to a first hand
knowledge of their material a cultivated
talent in the art of conveying that knowl-
edge to the general public. The greater
engineering projects will depend to an
increasing degree upon the making of
favorable contacts with the public that
must support them. It is only too well
known that the engineer has often neg-
lected this feature of his preparation. It is
therefore the primary purpose of Sigma
Rho Tau to encourage the speech activities
which will best fit the professional man
to meet his responsibilities in the field of
public relations.
The society is somewhat unusual, too,
in that it does not confine its activity to
the selection of those who have dis-
tinguished themselves in the routine
courses of their collegiate training, but
having awakened an aspirant to an appre-
ciation of the task and of its opportuni-
ties, it furnishes him with the guidance
and practice necessary for his progress.
The work and influence of Sigma Rho
Tau will prove helpful complements to
any speech courses offered in the institu-
tion where a chapter may be located. Since
expression should accompany all impres-
sion, it is held that four years of speech
practice is none too much. As candidates
for membership are under the supervision
of the society for four years, it is hoped
that the inspiring association and the stim-
ulating prospect of honor and recognition
will thus have a definite directional exect.
The present officers of Sigma Rho Tau
are as follows: Robert R. Redmon, Presi-
dent; Ralph Kroy, Vice-President; David
C. Redding, Recording Secretary; W.
Philip Ardussi, Corresponding Secretary;
Brian M. Moriarty, Treasurer. It is sug-
gested that anyone who is interested in
taking advantage of what Sigma Rho Tau
has to offer should contact one of these
men or Professor Robert D. Brackett, ad-
visor.
Sophomore Engineering Council
In the spring of 1954 the Freshman
Engineering Class felt a need for class
organization which would extend into the
sophomore year; the result of this feeling
was the forming of the Sophomore Engi-
neering Council. The purpose of this
council is to represent the large number
of sophomore engineers who have not
chosen their field of development or
who have not joined departmental socie-
ties, and also to fulfill the need for repre-
sentation of the Sophomore Class in the
College of Engineering functions. This
fall the council is planning to request
recognition on the new Engineering Coun-
cil. One of the basic reasons to seek
this representation is to give a part in the
Engineering Council's activities to the
many sophomore engineers who are not

Electrical conductors for wires and cables
are generally made from either aluminum
or copper. Except as noted below under
annealing and metal coating, essentially the
same method is used in preparing electrical
conductors from these metals.
The metal, after purification at the refinery!
is cast into billets about four inches squara
and about four feet long. For use in electrical
conductors, this billet is reduced in crosJ
sectional area to produce the flexibility
required in the finished wire or cable. Fed
example, weatherproof wire for outsitrf
power distribution, where little flexibility a]
required, contains conductors that are solil
or made of relatively few wires. For heated
cord and welding cable, where excesshfl
flexing in service occurs, the conductors ail
made up of a large number of small wire
Between these two extremes there is a wid
variety of cable constructions requirit
numerous sizes of wires.
The reduction in area of the billet i
begun on the rolling mill where the billet
reduced to rods, the commercial sizes &lt;
which vary from about one-quarter to three
quarters inch in diameter. Rods are reduce
to final wire sizes by drawing through
succession of dies of gradually decreasii
diameter, the reduction in area per die a
draft being about 30 per cent.
The drawing of wire increases its hardness
and tensile strength and decreases its elon-
gation and electrical conductivity. Since
elongation determines the ability of a
material to withstand repeated bending or
flexing, it follows that the drawing of wire
reduces its flexibility. Except where strength
is important, as in weatherproof wires sup-
ported aerially, practically all electrical con-
ductors should have greater flexibility and
electrical conductivity than that provided
by hard-drawn wire. Both flexibility and
conductivity are improved by annealing
hard-drawn wire.
Annealing consists of subjecting the wire in
coils or on spools to a temperature of about
650°F for about two hours. Large coils or
spools may require a longer time and higher
temperature. To prevent tarnishing during
the annealing of copper wire, it is neces-
sary to anneal in an inert (oxygen free) at-
mosphere. This precaution is not necessary
in annealing aluminum wire. Annealing of
hard-drawn wire increases its ultimate
elongation about 2000 per cent and elec-
trical conductivity about 3 per cent

Metal Coating
nprotected copper in contact with rubber
sulation combines with sulphur in the in-
lation to form copper sulphide. This re-
ices the conductivity of the copper and
ikes it brittle and difficult to solder,
irthermore, copper in contact with rubber,
celerates the combination of rubber with
ygen and hence promotes the detcriora-
»n of rubber insulation. To prevent this
DtuaUy harmful action, copper for use in
bber-insulated wires and cables is pro-
ved with cither a thin continuous coat-
5 of inert metal, such as tin, lead, or
id-tin alloy on the individual wires or a
parator consisting of a wrap of threads or
pe over the uncoated conductor.
Metal coating consists of passing the in-
tidual copper wires successively through
I dilute hydrochloric acid, (b) molten
etal or alloy, (c) a wiper, (d) a cooling bath
d finally to a take-up reel. The hydro-
loric acid cleans the surface of the copper
&gt;uring a perfect union between the copper
d the coating metal and a complete cov-
age of the copper by the coating metal.
le wiper removes the excess coating ma-
rial and produces a smooth surface on
e coated wire.
Metal coating or a separator is not re-
quired on aluminum conductors for rubber
insulated cables since aluminum does not
combine readily with sulphur and does not
accelerate the deterioration of rubber.
Stranding off
Conductors
As pointed out above, the purpose of wire
drawing is to so reduce the cross-sectional
area of the billet or rod that a conductor of
the required flexibility can be produced. In
addition to adequate flexibility, the conduc-
tor must also have sufficient cross-sectional
area to provide the current carrying capac-
ity and voltage drop required for a par-
ticular application. In general, the service
conditions and current carrying capacity of
wires and cables are such that conductors
of greater flexibility than is obtained with
a single wire (solid conductors) are required.
Solid conductors arc used generally only on
sizes 6 Awg. and smaller conductors and
then only for fixed (not portable) installa-
tions. Most conductors, are, therefore, made
up of more than one wire.
The formation of a conductor by bring-
ing together the required number of wires
is known as stranding, and the conductor
thus formed is known as a stranded con-
ductor. There are two fundamentally dif-
ferent types of stranding, namely, bunched
stranding and concentric stranding. These
differ in the manner in which the wires are
assembled to form a conductor.
Bunched Stranding
In bunched stranding, the required number
of wires are simply twisted together with
no attempt being made to control their rela-
tive positions within the group. The length
of the group requiring a complete turn of
any one wire is known as length of lay of
the strands. The length of lay varies widely
with the number and size of the wires and
the flexibility desired in the conductor.
Concentric Stranding
In concentric stranding the individual wires
are laid up symmetrically in the form of a
geometrically compact group. For example,
six wires will lay snugly around one central
wire, twelve wires will lay around a group
of seven, etc. All of the wires are laid up
around the same or a common center, hence
the term "concentric stranding"'. The num-
ber of wires in the outer layer increases by
six and the total number of wires in the
assembly becomes 1, 7, 19, etc. The wires
in any one layer are cabled or twisted
around the central core with a definite
length and direction of lay. The direction of
lay of the wires is reversed in alternate
layers to equalize the torsional forces result-
ing from twisting the wires about the cen-
tral core. The length of lay depends on the
size of the individual wires and the number
of layers in the conductor.
Rope Stranding
A modification of concentric stranding
known as rope stranding is used chiefly in
the preparation of large flexible conductors
for portable and welding cables. This differs
from concentric stranding in that a group of
wires, known as ropes, instead of individual
wires, are laid up in a geometrically com-
pact form of six around one, etc. These
groups of wires may be cither concentric or
bunched stranded. This type of stranding
makes possible building up a conductor with
a greater number of wires than can be pro-
duced by concentric stranding on a machine
with a given number of spools.
Other Strandings
Other types of conductor strandings, such
as "sector-shape", "compact-strand" and
"segmental" are used for special purposes to
reduce conductor diameters and conductor
losses.

reached by the five members at large to
the council. By having the Sophomore
Council represented on the Engineering
Council, there would be a more direct
method of representing the sophomore
by placing him under a specific category,
such as the Sophomore Council, allowing
the members at large to devote their time
to the many other engineering students
who have no direct representation on the
Engineering Council.
The basic criteria for judging the value
of the Sophomore Council or of the Engi-
neering Council is to see how more direct
representation can be given to the engi-
neering students. It is a direct correlation
to this that more work could be done
faster and in a more direct method for
determining the opinion of engineering
students in a questionable situation. The
aim of the Sophomore Council as pre-
sented in the Bylaws of its Constitution
is, "to aid the Engineering Council in all
possible ways, and specifically by present-
ing problems which can best be handled
by the Engineering Council."
In order to get the organization for the
Sophomore Council underway this year,
elections to the council were held in the
spring of the freshman year. Five mem-
bers were elected to the council with a
president, vice president, and secretary.
These officers will serve in their elected
capacity for one semester; the five mem-
bers were elected for the entire sophomore
year.
Electing officers in the freshman year
through Freshman Assembly and with the
help of the Freshman Engineering Coun-
cil seemed entirely satisfactory. It would
be very impractical to attempt to bring
the sophomore class together any other
way to hold an election; consequently, this
will probably be the method of election
proposed by the Sophomore Engineering
Council to be followed by future fresh-
man classes.
There is still much to be done in the
organization of the Sophomore Engineer-
ing Council. The important thing which
the council would like to do this year is
gain representation in the new Engineer-
ing Council. This done they will best be
able to fulfill their purpose of represent-
ing the sophomore engineers who have
not joined a departmental society.

part of the 19th century for the expressed
purpose of recognizing achievement in
the field of engineering. Scholastic record,
moral and ethical character, personality,
and extracurricular activities are the basis
for selection. Tau Beta Pi has grown a
great deal in size and now has nearly 100
chapters in the United States.
At Michigan the membership ranges
from 60-90, depending upon the num-
ber of students in school and other fac-
tors. The group is interested in educa-
tional, social, and project type activities.
Meetings are held semi-weekly and are
devoted to speakers, discussions, business,
and other informative programs. As part
of the social calendar two banquets, a
weekend at a nearby lake, and other social
functions are held each year. Projects are
continually varying and include such
things as faculty evaluation by students
throughout the college, and a brush up
session for the Professional Engineers
Examination. Tau Beta Pi also puts out a
small problem booklet in conjunction with
the review session.
Because of its nature as an honorary
organization, membership is gained
through a selective process and is limited
to upperclassmen. However, Tau Beta Pi
has a very strong and active alumni or-
ganization and for most members this
means a very pleasant and worthwhile
experience.
Michigan Technic
The Technic is the oldest engineering
college magazine in America, being en-
tered as second-class matter under act of
March 3, 1879. Though old and wise the
Technic is always in need of fresh ideas
and new blood. There is plenty of room
for newcomers.
Many students think that they have to
be a Sinclair Lewis or a Shakespeare to be
on the staff. Actually, although good
writers are always needed, there are many
jobs on the staff which require complete-
ly different types of talent. To mention a
few there are advertising, circulation, and
illustrations. No matter what you're good
at, there's room for you at the Technic.
Another thing students fear is that it
will take too much of their time, but you
only spend as much time as you can spare
at the Technic and it never amounts to
more than a few hours a week. This little
time is well spent as you get much valu-
able experience on how to put a magazine
out, how to twist an article out of a pro-
fessor, and how to run a business. Then
at the end of the year there's a big steak
dinner. So let's see more people at the
steak dinner.
Vulcans
Vulcans is the senior engineering hon-
orary for men. It was founded in 190-1
for the purpose of recognizing achieve-
ment in scholastic and extracurricular ac-
tivities. The membership totals about 20.
with men being tapped in their senior
year.
Vulcan activities center around the
chapter room which is located in the
Union Tower on the fifth floor. Since the
group consists of seniors who are active
in other organizations, it is natural that
a great deal of time is spent in discuss-
ing problems and projects for both the
Engineering School and the whole cam-
pus. However, since the group is an Hon-
orary, no public stand is taken on any
issue.
Each fall and spring Vulcans sponsor
student trains to the East and to Chicago.
Fares are provided at a reduced rate be-
cause of the large group. In the past Vul-
can funds have been used to buy TV.
sets for the Hospital, Furniture for the
smoking room in the West Engineering
basement, and to provide support for the
Honor Council and the Steering Commit-
tee. At the present time there are Vulcan
funds set aside for a scholarship and to
help other groups who are in need of
temporary assistance.
The Vulcan social calendar is an im-
portant part of the group's activity. Each
year several parties are held and every
June the Vulcans end their college life
with a steak fry. Last spring Vulcans held
their fiftieth anniversary. It was held on
the same weekend as Michigras and was
a great success.

The metal that makes time stand still
Thanks to chromium, steel now serves you with strength and beauty that lasts a lifetime
In time, one of man's most useful materials—steel—
is often the victim of such destructive forces as rust,
corrosion, heat, or wear.
THESE NATURAL ENEMIES of steel now are mastered
by the metal called chromium. When the right amount of
chromium is added to molten steel, the result is strong,
lustrous stainless steel that defies the ravages of time.
IN HOMES, TODAY, stainless steel is a shining sym-
bol of modern living. It brings us care-free sinks, gleam-
ing tableware and kitchen utensils—all with beauty that
lasts a lifetime.
IN INDUSTRY—Food is prepared in super-sanitary
stainless steel equipment. Streamlined trains and buses
are made of this wonder metal. Vital parts of jet planes
that must withstand both blazing heat and sub-zero cold
are made of tough, enduring stainless steel.
SERVING STEEL... AND YOU—The people of Union
Carbide produce alloys of chromium for America's steel-
makers. This is another of the many ways in which
UCC transforms the elements of nature for the benefit
of everyone.

project will cost about 10 million, in-
cluding research and development. North
American will assume 2.5 million of this
cost. In addition the company will pro-
vide land for the reactor site, which is to
be located near the company's present
rocket engine field test laboratory in the
Santa Susana Mountains just north of the
greater Los Angeles area.
The reactor, called the SRE (Sodium
Reactor Experiment) will be a "sodium-
graphite" nuclear reactor generating
20,000 kilowatts of energy in the form
of heat. This type reactor will operate at
higher temperatures than do some other
reactor types. This is expected to result in
high over-all plant efficiency.
Because the most essential development
problems are in the reactor and heat ex-
changer system rather than in turbines
and other generating equipment, no elec-
tricity will be produced at this time.
When fission occurs in the reactor, heat
will be produced. This heat will be trans-
ferred to liquid sodium circulating
through the "core" of the reactor where
IN THE NEWS
(Continued from page 17)
the fission takes place. The sodium will
then be pumped to an exchanger where
the heat will be removed. If electricity
were to be produced, the heat would be
used to make steam, which in turn would
drive a turbo-generator.
While it is not difficult to produce elec-
tricity from atomic energy, a large amount
of technical development is necessary to
reduce the costs of the process. Economi-
cal electrical power from atomic energy
depends upon the production of useful
heat in a reactor at a cost comparable with
the present methods using conventional
fuels such as coal and oil.
Work with the SRE is expected to pro-
vide some of the detailed engineering
experience and to develop some of the
operational equipment needed to produce
economical power. Several other avenues
of study are being followed in the AEC's
program to develop nuclear power tech-
nology.
The development of fuel elements and
various combinations of fissionable ma-
terials for the reactor core will be an im-
portant part of the program. The reactor

is slated to use uranium slightly enriched
in Uranium 23, in the core. Studies can
also be made with Thorium, and Uranium
233 in the core.
Studies will be made of various ma-
terials, components, and structural assem-
blies to check their function in the nuclear
reactor system. The operation of such
equipment will be checked not only from
the standpoint of physical durability and
ability to do the job, but the over-all effi-
ciency of operation as well. This will in-
clude the development of pumps which
will be required to transfer the liquid
sodium through the reactor and heat ex-
changers, shielding materials, and similar
"hardware" used for the mechanical proc-
esses involved.
North American scientists and engi-
neers in the company's Atomic Energy
Research Department believe that the so-
dium-graphite reactor is a promising re-
actor type for the economical production
of power.
Characteristics of sodium which made
it particularly suitable as a reactor coolant
are the metal's low neutron absorption
qualities, good heat transfer properties,
low melting point, and high boiling
point. Use of sodium permits the produc-
tion of the high temperature without high
pressure.
The reactor, including the core and the
cooling sodium, will be encased in a steel
tank. This entire unit is to be installed
underground, with five feet of dense con-
crete between the reactor and ground
level.
Graphite, used to moderate or slow
down the neutrons which cause the Uran-
ium 235 to fission, will surround the fuel.
The design calls for 10,000 gallons of
sodium to flow through the core, and
absorb the heat of the fission process.
Boron-steel control rods will regulate
the fission rate of the reactor, and are to
be moved by electric motors in and out
of the core. Such rods control the fission
process by absorbing neutrons. Safety
elements will serve to stop fission and
shut down the reactor when required.
The sodium will be heated and pumped
to a primary heat exchanger. Because the
sodium coming directly from the reactor
will be radioactive, this metal will give
up its heat through a primary exchanger
to another sodium circulation system. The
second system will take the heat via un-
contaminated sodium to a second ex-

changer where the heat can be provided
without the presence of radioactivity.
No fumes, gases, or other exhaust ma-
terial will be emitted into the atmosphere,
as the reactor will operate on a closed
cycle system.
The reactor will be housed in a build-
ing about 100 feet long and 50 feet wide,
with a 45 foot high bay area overhead.
Including the connecting buildings, which
will house machine shop, laboratory and
office facilities, a total of about 20,000
square feet of covered floor area will be
used for the SRE project. Only three tech-
nicians will be required to operate the
reactor. Other engineers and scientists at
the site will conduct various investigations
and studies for the industrial power de-
velopment program. Construction of the
reactor is slated to begin shortly with
completion expected in about two years.
Shortly after the end of World War II,
North American began research and de-
velopment work in the atomic energy
field. Since 1948 the company has been
engaged in reactor design and develop-
ment work, together with associated proj-
ects, for the Atomic Energy Commission.
North American is the major contractor
to the AEC exploring sodium-graphite
power reactor possibilities.
In addition to the company's work with
power reactors, North American has also
designed and built two research reactors
for industrial, scientific, and medical
work. The two reactors now operating in
California were constructed for the AEC
by the company. Both machines are of the
solution type, using a water solution of
fissionable material in the core. One of
the machines is in operation at North
American's Downey, California, plant
where it is used in connection with nu-
clear research studies. The other reactor
is being used by the Atomic Energy Com-
mission for materials research at the
Livermore Research Laboratory, Liver-
more, California.
North American's Atomic Energy Re-
search Department is headed by Dr.
Chauncey Starr, Director, and is staffed
with 300 engineers, scientists and tech-
nicians.
Magnetic Fatigue Tester
By determining the load that can be
applied repeatedly to steel samples with-
out causing failure, detailed information
on how to build and fabricate greater
safety into steel conveyances and struc-
tures will be available from the new Re-
search Center now under construction by
U. S. Steel near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
Such research into the endurance limits
of steels makes it possible for engineers
to design within safe limits without ex-
cessive weight or waste.
One of the machines now being used
for such research at U. S. Steel's Research
and Development Laboratory in the Oak-
land District of Pittsburgh is a magnetic
fatigue tester. Samples of steel from 24
to 36 inches in length and up to 2 inches
thick and 5 inches wide can be subjected
to controlled vibrations at the natural fre-
quency of the test piece.
The machine consists of two rubber-
padded supports upon which the test
piece is placed, an electro-magnet located
at each end of the tester, pick-up coils at
the center of the sample, a power unit
with controls, a stroboscopic light, and a
micro-comparator to measure vibration
amplitudes.
A piece of steel, which must be long
enough to extend over the two end mag-
nets, is placed on the rubber-padded sup-
ports and the end magnets arc positioned
under the ends of the sample. An alter-
nating current is then supplied to the end
magnets to set the steel vibrating, much
after the fashion of a tuning fork.
Each experimental section has a natural
frequency at which it will vibrate, the
natural frequency depending on the di-
mensions of the piece. The center pick-
up coils translate the motion into electrical
impulses which feed back to the power
unit at the natural frequency of the
sample. These impulses control the pul-
sations of electricity from the power unit
to the end magnets so they match the fre-
quency of the specimen and keep it
vibrating.
The amplitude of the sample's vibra-
tions depends on the intensity of the cur-
rent supplied to the end magnets.
When a crack develops in the test
specimen, its natural vibrational frequency
changes. This change upsets the rhythm
of impulses from the pick-up coils to the
power unit and the machine automatically
stops.
By use of the micro-comparator, the
research scientist can easily measure the
amplitude of the vibration or the amount
of bending.
The stroboscopic light is used to estab-
lish the location of very small fatigue
cracks. This is done by adjusting the light
from the stroboscope to a frequency

GRADUATE
SEMINAR
The problem of finding the right job
and of the transition from school to ca-
reer work will be the key topics of a pro-
gram of weekly meetings to be offered to
seniors and graduate students this semes-
ter. The meetings, held on Wednesdays
at 4 p.m. in Room 311, West Engineer-
ing Bldg., started on September 29, when
Dean George G. Brown spoke on "Find-
ing the Right Job."
Following meetings will discuss the na-
ture of various employment opportunities
and the personal aptitudes desirable for
each, the student's own aptitudes as re-
lated to his employment, the techniques
of interviewing and conducting correspon-
dence, and the human relations involved
in industrial society.
Discussed and endorsed by the Engi-
neering Council last spring, the program
has been developed by Prof. John G.
Young, Assistant to the Dean of Engi-
neering, and a faculty committee includ-
ing Professors K. W. Hall, H. A. Ohl-
gren, R. L. Evaldson, R. A. Flinn, B. G.
Johnston, and J. J. Carey.
In addition to faculty members from
Engineering and other units of the Uni-
versity, the program will include repre-
sentatives from a number of industrial
and engineering organizations.
Industrial Art
A new plant, now under construction
by a greeting-card concern in Kansas
City, will feature a roof-top zoo, according
to Factory Management and Maintenance.
The animals will provide live research
for company artists in their sketches for
new cards.
Glamorized Gasoline
The increase in the number of women
drivers—one out of every 3.2 drivers to-
day compared to one out of every 4.6
drivers in 1950—emphasizes the necessity
of giving more consideration to service
station appeal to women, according to
National Petroleum News.
World's Worst
A Danbury, Conn., firm claims to have
the world's worst railroad. The roadbed,
laid in the plant yard, is made from
samples of the worst rail faults found in
the thousands of miles of track tested by
the firm's rail-inspection cars as they
travel through the country. The track
serves as a guaranteed source of faults for
cars as they are checked out after being
reconditioned, and contain about 120
different kinds of breaks, cracks, pits,
holes and other dangerous faults—all in
about one-fifth of a mile.
Rivet-less Rims for Tubeless Tires
A major automotive supplier has
switched from rivets to welds in its wheel
production, American Machinist, reports.
The reason for the change, according to
the firm, is that welded wheels are ideal
with the new tubeless tires.
Welding Spurs Shipbuilding
Progress in welding is largely respons-
ible for the fact that the few shipyards
in West Germany turned out vessels total-
ing 725,000 tons in 1953 as against an
average production of 250,000 tons by
German yards before the war, Welding
Engineer, reports. Among exhibits at the
recent Cutting and Welding Exhibition
in Essen were welded high-pressure steam
boilers, seamless welded parts of steel
bridges, welded gas containers and ship
sections.
It's America's lifeline, really—the power line
that starts with steam and brings heat, light,
and energy to the nation's factories, farms,
homes and stores. Paralleling that line is the
line of cost, which America's Utilities have
striven mightily to reduce over the years. Even
today, with vast increases in the cost of all
the things America's privately owned electric
companies must buy, the cost of electricity
has not increased in proportion.
Since 1881, when Thomas A. Edison opened
the nation's first electric generating station,
B&amp;W, who supplied his boilers, has pursued
a fruitful, continuing search for better and
better ways to generate steam and to harness
more and more usable energy from fuel
consumed.
Economical, dependable service is the watch-
word of America's Electric Companies. The
chart reflects how well their all-important job
is being done. And to help insure that elec-
tricity will remain America's best bargain,
B&amp;W Research and Engineering dedicates
men, money and machines to
continuing progress in steam
and fuel technology.

slightly higher or slightly lower than that
of the vibrating sample. In this light, the
test piece appears to be bending very
slowly and its surfaces can be carefully
examined for very small cracks.
A test sample about %-inch thick by 3
inches wide by 30 inches long will vibrate
at about 100 cycles per second. Middle C
in the diatonic scale is 256 cycles per
second and C below middle C is 130
cycles per second or almost 8,000 per
minute. Past experience and innumerable
tests have proven that if a specimen can
endure 10,000,000 cycles at a certain am-
plitude without failure, it will withstand
an infinite number of vibrations at that
amplitude.
If a structural component is desired
with a minimum of 20,000 pounds per
square inch endurance limit, the research
scientist can very quickly determine on the
magnetic fatigue tester what steels will
meet the requirement. Resistance to fa-
tigue failure is important to insure a safe
design.
Through the application of the re-
sults from such tests on steels for aircraft,
bridges, and other applications in which
cyclonic loading occurs, engineers can de-
sign lighter and safer structures. The
machine also makes possible the deter-
mination of the fatigue limits of steels
with various surface finishes and with
welds, rivets, and other fastenings.
New Interference Microscope
General Motors Research Laboratories
is pioneering in the industrial use of a
new type of microscope that measures
"peaks" and "valleys" ranging from two
to 100 millionths of an inch.
Known as the interference microscope,
it appears promising not only as a re-
search tool but also may become a quality
control instrument where microscopic
smoothness or roughness is important in
industry.
Physicists working with it, William L.
Grube and Stanley R. Rouze of GM Re-
search Laboratories Physics and Instru-
mentation department, say it adds the di-
mension of depth to the art or practice
of examining microscopic surfaces, a di-
mension ordinary microscopes cannot
measure.
"It's like looking at the side of a house
straight on," said Mr. Grube, "and meas-
uring how far the bricks stick out from
the mortar. You don't have to get a profile
or cross-sectional view to make your
(Continued from page 34)
measurements."
The optical interference principle by
which the microscope operates is not new,
Mr. Grube pointed out. However, indus-
trial application of the microscope to
surface finish details of such minuteness is
a new development.
GM Research Laboratories has one of
the first three instruments built on this
continent.
Some years ago the laboratories experi-
mented with the interference microscope-
technique, using makeshift equipment.
Later, at the request of GM Research, an
optical company constructed a commercial
model, and the first unit was delivered in
1950.
Since then researchers have been ex-
panding its usefulness by trying it on a
wide variety of industrial problems.
Glass Block Splits Beam
Briefly, the interference or split beam
principle is described as follows:
A beam of light is directed into a block
of glass or "beam splitter." The light is
split into two parts, with one part being
directed through a lens to a flat reflecting
surface.
The other part of the beam is directed
downward through another lens where
it is reflected from the surface of a speci-
men under examination.
After being reflected from the flat re-
flecting surface and from the specimen
surface, the two beams return through

their respective lenses to the beam splitter
where they recombine to form an "inter-
ference pattern."
The pattern appears as a series of lines
—even and parallel if the surface is
smooth, or zebra-like, wavy and jagged if
the surface is uneven or marred by ma-
chining marks or scratches.
The pattern can be viewed through an
eyepiece similar to the eyepiece of a
conventional microscope.
Thus, depth of scratches or peaks and
valleys of an unsmooth surface can be
measured by their deviation from the
straight-line pattern obtained from smooth
surfaces.
Measured Plating Thickness
Already the microscope has been used
to measure plating thickness, to deter-
mine leveling abilities of plating materials
(i.e., how they smooth a surface by fill-
ing in irregularities) and to study effects
of weathering on painted surfaces.
It likewise has been used to control
precision roughness standards. These are
used throughout industry to standardize
machined surfaces of bearings, cylinder
walls, piston liners, valves and other high-
ly machined, close fitting parts in automo-
tive and aircraft engines.
Another use has been to check corro-
sion pits and other defects on plated parts
and other surfaces such as cylinder bores
and bearings.
Mr. Grube said that in this era of pre-
cision machinery and highly decorative
finishes, many surfaces require the sensi-
tivity of the two-beam interference micro-
scope which can detect surface variations
as small as two millionths of an inch.
Commercial Atomic Power
in 5 to 10 Years
A top atomic official of General Elec-
tric, Francis K. McCune, has predicted
that privately financed atomic power
plants will succssfully compete with con-
ventional power plants in 5 to 10 years.
Speaking at the Atomic Industrial
Forum, in Washington, D.C., May 24,
McCune said:
"First, we at General Electric believe
that electric utility companies will be
owning and operating a number of atomic
power plants within the next 10 years.
"Second, we believe some of these will
be full-scale and, what is most important,
they will generate electricity at competitive

gave each side an opportunity to bring
out the shortcomings of the other. The
apparent outcome of the debate was that
scientists should step down from their
ivory towers occasionally and relate their
work to the world about them, while
journalists should observe more accurate
reporting methods and indulge in less
pseudo-scientific speculation.
Besides the above discussions and the
presentation of recently unclassified tech-
nical papers, the Congress considered two
other broad topics: The Education of Nu-
clear Engineers and the Social Impact of
Nuclear Energy.
A panel of educational leaders headed
by Manson Benedict of M.I.T. consider-
ed the first of these topics. They reported
that present training in nuclear engineer-
ing departments rather than as a separate
curriculum. Several industrial speakers en-
dorsed this approach, and most everyone
seemed to agree that this was most di-
sirable at the present time.
The Social Impact of Nuclear Energy
was treated by eight speakers who consid-
ered nuclear developments from the
standpoint of health, safety, the individ-
(Continued from page 13)
ual, education, military tactics, scientific
research, the law, and its influence on
religious thought. One of the most stirr-
ing speeches of the conference was given
by Dr. Elton Trueblood, chief of religious
information, U.S. Information Agency.
In discussing the effect of nuclear energy
on religious thought, Dr. Trueblood re-
called meeting with a group of scientists
shortly after the first atomic bomb ex-
plosion. Never, he said, had he been
among men who evoked such wonder as
to what the world would be like in the
future. He claimed that four insights are
needed today: Antidotes to ( 1) absolute
despair, (2) easy optimism, (3) insensi-
tivity to the use of nuclear weapons and,
(4) recognition that the ultimate solution
of our problems will be spiritual.
In conjunction with the Congress an
Atoms for Peace exposition was held in
the Rackham Building. Over forty com-
panies set up displays and exhibits and
had representatives on hand to demon-
strate and explain them. Among the most
popular exhibits were the manipulators
used by scientists to work with radio-
active materials from a safe distance. Visi-
tors to the exhibit were able to open
bottles, pour liquids, wind their watches,
etc. with these amazing gadgets. Of in-
terest to visiting engineers were the sealed
centrifugal pumps used for circulating
radioactive liquids and the drawings of
various sorts of reactors exhibited by
many companies. The illustrations ac-
companying this article show a few typi-
cal exhibits.
There was much talk and speculation
during the three-day conference as to the
future of Nuclear Engineering and of the
Nuclear Engineering Division of A.I.-
Ch.E. Many of those present thought the
Division ought to reorganize and form
a society for Nuclear Engineering inde-
pendent of A.I.Ch.E. The majority of
those attending, however, were in favor
of maintaining the status quo and wait-
ing to see how the field of Nuclear Engi-
neering develops. Few persons think that
it can be assimilated into one of the
present fields (chemical engineering be-
ing the most likely one) ; the question is
will it remain simply a component of all
fields (as it must to a certain extent, re-
gardless), or will it separate into a dis-
tinct engineering field?
In either case, this much seems sure:
the progress of professional development
in Nuclear Engineering will in a large
measure be determined by the govern-
ment's security policy. Tight security re-
strictions could delay development for
many years.
The first Nuclear Engineering Con-
gress, then, was more than just another
technical meeting; it was a step towards
more liberal distribution of nuclear in-
formation (and thus, the professional de-
velopment of Nuclear Engineering). And
above this, it was a most encouraging
omen for the future of science in this
Nuclear Age.

Until a few decades ago, the principal users of wax
were the candlestick makers. Today's diversified de-
mands for wax put it in the class of modern industrial
miracles.
Go into a super-market. . . see how wax works in
the packaging and protection of milk and dairy prod-
ucts, cereals, bake goods, frozen foods. Think of its
use in drug and cosmetic products . . . cups, crayons
and carbon paper . . . polishes, preservatives and
paper matches . . . And the number of industrial ap-
plications defies accurate calculation.
TOO BIG FOR BEES...
The ancients knew the physical properties of wax ...
and bees supplied the raw material. What then
spurred this century's growth in production to more
than a half-million tons a year?
The answer lies partly in the petroleum industry's
desire to find more profitable applications for one of
its'products partly in the desire of other industries
to improve their processes and products.
AMERICA WORKS LIKE THAT...
Here, industry is paradoxical. It is independent, yet
dependent... cooperative, yet competitive. It strives
to make more money, yet is always seeking ways to
keep costs and prices down.
And, to further these aims, management relies on
the constant flow of information available through
America's all-seeing, all-hearing and reporting Inter-
Communications System.
THE AMERICAN INTER-COM SYSTEM . . .
Complete communication is the function, the unique
contribution of the American business press ... a
great group of specially edited magazines devoted to
the specialized work areas of men who want to man-
age better, research better, sell better, buy better.
COMMUNICATION IS OUR BUSINESS . . .
Many of the textbooks in which you are now studying
the fundamentals of your specialty bear the McGraw-
Hill imprint. For McGraw-Hill is the world's largest
publisher of scientific and technical works.
After you leave school, you will want to keep
abreast of developments in your chosen profession.
Then one of McGraw-Hill's many business magazines
will provide current information that will help you
in your job.

ideal working and learning climate is, he
will not find it exemplified perfectly any-
where—in any industry, in any college or
university, nor in his association with any
technical society. Human beings are sel-
dom capable of perfection in anything.
The young engineer then needs to adjust
his own thinking to the situation as he
finds it and to try to improve the situa-
tion and himself within the framework
which he finds. One thing is certain, a
wholesale attitude in each new engineer
in any laboratory is a force to the good.
One candle in the dark can shed its light
a great distance; so the new engineer is
capable of being a strong influence in
creating the right kind of atmosphere in
places where it did not exist before his
arrival.
Conclusion
In summary, the entire program of
helping make the engineer's first five
years in industry successful is a joint ef-
fort. I want to emphasize, however, that
in the final analysis engineering educa-
tion, technical societies, and industry
can serve only to assist the young engi-
neer in his own development—to point
the way. The sole responsibility for as-
suming and developing right attitudes
toward work, toward people, and toward
living—and thus developing a successful
life—rests squarely on the shoulders of
the young engineer. No agency or other
person can do the job for him.
The young engineer will find that hard
work on his part is the key to his success
not only in his five years but in all his
years to follow and gentlemen, there
is something dignified about hard work.
If he needs assistance and is looking for
a helping hand, let him first be sure to
use the two that are hanging at his side.
This, in a nut shell, is what "Experi-
ence Tells Me."

and now Supervisor of Plant Engineering,
Allis-Chalmers, Norwood, Ohio, Works
"~K Kost men graduating from college don't have a
XVJ. clear idea of what they want to do. These indi-
viduals are helped by Allis-Chalmers Graduate Train-
ing Course to find the right job whether it be in design,
sales, engineering, research or manufacturing.
"My case is a little different, however. I started the
course with all my interest centered on tool design and
*in-plant' service. The reason is that I started getting
vocational guidance from some very helpful Allis-
Chalmers men back in 1940."
Served Apprenticeship
"At their suggestion I had gone to school part time
while working full time. This not only gave me the
chance to serve an apprenticeship as a tool and die
maker, and earn money, but I learned what I wanted
to do after graduation.
"Then came the war and service in the Navy. After
the war I finished school. By the time I started on the
course in 1948, I knew what I liked and seemed best
fitted to do. As a result, my entire time as a GTC stu-
dent was spent in the shops.
"The 18 months spent in the foundry, erection floor
and machine shop have all proved valuable background
for my present job.
"As supervisor of plant engineering at the Norwood
Works, I am concerned with such problems as: Plant
layout, material handling equipment and methods, new
construction, new production methods to be used in
building motors, centrifugal pumps, and Texrope
drives. It's an extremely interesting job.
"From my experience, I'd say, whether you're a
freshman or a senior it will pay you to talk to an Allis-
Chalmers representative now. You can't start plan-
ning your future too soon. And you can't plan starting
at a better place, because Allis-Chalmers builds so many
different products that you'll find any type of engi-
neering activity you could possibly want right here."
Facts You Should Know About the ALLIS-CHALMERS Graduate Training Course
1. It's well established, having been
started in 1904. A large percentage of the
management group are graduates of the
course.
3. The course offers a maximum of 24
months' training. Length and type of
training is individually planned.
3. The graduate engineer may choose the
kind of work he wants to do: design, en-
gineering, research, production, sales,
erection, service, etc.
4. He may choose the kind of power,
processing, specialized equipment or in-
dustrial apparatus with which he will
work, such as: steam or hydraulic, turbo-
generators, circuit breakers, unit substa-
tions, transformers, motors, control
pumps, kilns, coolers, rod and ball mills,
crushers, vibrating screens, rectifiers, in-
duction and dielectric heaters, grain mills,
sifters, etc.
5. He will have individual attention and
guidance of experienced, helpful superiors
in working out his training program.
6. The program has as its objective the
right job for the right man. As he gets ex-
perience in different training locations he
can alter his course of training to match
changing interests.

"Third, we believe that this will be ac-
complished without government subsidy
for production-plant construction or oper-
ation, and with government-supplied fuel
priced at cost-of-production levels."
McCune made it clear that he was at-
tempting in no way "to detract from the
immeasurable significance of knowledge
developed through Atomic Energy Com-
mission contracts."
"Of course, the government's large ex-
penditures for research and development
of plutonium production reactors, mobile
power reactors, and other power reactors
form the base from which private indus-
try can proceed," he went on to say.
He further stressed that G-E studies
show that production-size atomic power
plants can be made to operate economi-
cally.
"They will stand on their own feet," he
continued. They will certainly buy nuclear
fuel from the government. But trading
with the government need not be a sub-
sidy."

most effective competition with conven-

tional fuel plants were described by Mc-
Cune as: 1) light-watcr-moderated and
cooled boiling reactor; and 2) graphite-
moderated water-cooled reactor.
The first type, he explained, would
eliminate the need for a boiler system, be-
cause water would be boiled inside the
reactor to produce radioactive steam that
would power a turbine.
The reason that the boiling reactor was
chosen by G-E experts in part, he told
Forum members, is its similarity in many
ways to conventional steam plants.
Its adoption by the electric utility in-
dustry should be relatively easy. The mod-
erator and coolant are both ordinary
water which the industry is used to hand-
ling. Chemical separations plants are not
necessary. The boiling reactor has safety
features that have been demonstrated so
that operating companies should be able
to choose plant sites as available within
their systems," McCune said.
"The light-water reactor," he went on
to explain, "is one which can become
competitive in the higher fuel-cost areas
of the country in the near future."
This reactor, according to G-E studies,
could produce electricity for 6.7 mills

per kilowatt-hour, compared to a cost of
6.9 mills for a conventional coal burn-
ing plant. Plants chosen for comparison
would each deliver 300,000 net kw of
electricity.
The cost figures described were derived
"on the basis of coal at $.35 per million
btu's, a price paid in a number of sec-
tions of this country.
McCune reported, "The fixed charges
are higher on the atomic plant. It is esti-
mated that operating costs are slightly
more. The big difference is in the
relatively low fuel cost, 1.35 mills per
kilowatt-hour for long-burn-up fuel."
He said long-burn-up fuel could re-
main in the reactor over a period of years
and still produce sufficient heat to operate
the power plant.
Cost of electricity from the graphite-
moderated reactor, the G-E official said,
would come to 6.8 mills per kilowatt-
hour.
McClune derived the numbers in this es-
timate from actual construction experience.

to a group of welding inspectors, according to Welding Engi-
neer. A dachshund, with a string attached to her leash, was

to pull a crawler with cobalt into the pipe to radiograph welds.
The dog was held at one end of the pipe while her owner,
fortified with a wiener, stood at the other end and provided
the incentive for the canine journey through the pipe.

An Australian city has proposed the packaging of milk in

There was a young and adventurous
man who found among his great-grand-
father's papers a piece of parchment that
revealed the location of a hidden treasure.
The instructions read:
"Sail to 16 North latitude and 16 West
longitude where thou wilt find a deserted
island. There lieth a large meadow, not
pent, on the north shore of the island
where standeth a lonely oak and a lonely
pine. There thou wilt see also an old
gallows on which we once were wont to
hang traitors. Start thou from the gallows
and walk to the oak counting thy steps.
At the oak thou must turn right by a
right angle and take the same number of
steps. Put here a spike in the ground.
Now must thou return to the gallows
and walk to the pine counting thy steps.
At the pine thou must turn left by a
right angle and see that thou takest the
same number of steps, and put another
spike into the ground. Dig halfway be-
tween the spikes; the treasure is there."
The instructions were quite clear and
explicit, so our young man chartered a
ship and sailed to the South Seas. He
found the island, the field, the oak and
the pine, but to his great sorrow the gal-
lows was gone. Too long a time had
passed since the document had been writ-
ten; rain and sun and wind had disinte-
grated the wood and returned it to the
soil, leaving no trace even of the place
where it once had stood. The young man,
not having gone to the University of
Michigan, soon gave up in despair. Per-
haps you can find it for him.
A squirrel is in a cage with an open
door at each end; he sticks his head out
one door, runs to the other door and
sticks his head out, and continues in the
same manner, back and forth. If the first
trip takes two seconds, and he doubles
his speed each trip, how long will it be
before his head is sticking out both doors
at once?
You are to cover a regular 64-square
checker-board with 31 domino-shaped
blocks, each of which just covers two
squares, leaving only two diagonally op-
posite corners uncovered. Can you do it.
A truck is to cross a desert 409 miles
wide. It can carry a load of 200 gallons
of gas, 20 gallons of which must be in
its fuel tank initially, and may not be
removed. The truck gets one mile per
gallon, and there is a dump of cans and
gas at the edge of the desert. It is ap-
parent that the truck must establish
dumps in the desert. How can this be
done to minimize fuel consumption? It is
said that Rommel's lieutenant did it with
fewer than 1600 gallons; can you?
A man gets off work early and takes
an earlier commuting train home, arriv-
ing at the home station just one hour
early. His chauffeur, who always starts
from the house so as to meet the train
precisely, meets the man walking home,
picks him up and returns home, arriving
ten minutes earlier than usual. The chaf-
feur drives at 30 mph. How fast does the
man walk?
Each of the following people made one
true and one false statement: A said, "I
was first. B is second." B said, "I was
third. A was last." C said, "I was second.
D was fourth." D said, "I was fourth. E
was first." E said, "C was second. I was
third." What was the true order?
A conical wine glass of 60° included
angle and 3" high is full of wine. What
diameter of steel ball placed in the glass
will displace the maximum amount of
wine?
A number has six digits. It may be
multiplied by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, and in
no case will the product possess a digit
different from those in the original num-
ber itself. What is the number?
You are to string a multi-wire cable,
and you come to a river, where you use
a different piece of waterproof cable. The
only way across the river is by a toll
bridge, and you are only allowed 3 one-
way trips across it. You must get the land
cables connected together, through the
underwater cable, correctly. The land
cables are color-coded, but the underwater
cable is not. The only equipment you
carry for testing is a battery and light
and a small amount of wire. There is no
good ground available. What limitation is
there on the number of wires which the
cable may contain.
Place three boxes in a horizontal line
representing three utility stations. In a
horizontal line directly below the utilities
place three more boxes representing three
houses. Can you string three wires from
each of the houses to the utilities without
crossing any of the lines?

ests of quality and costs of production,
and ruggedness and uniformity of use. As
embodied in the 1950 set, the efficiencies
of conversion of the transmitter and re-
ceiver are now so high that, on the shorter
loops losses are automatically introduced
in order to avoid the delivery of too
great loudness to ear of the listener.
Even in this scant presentation of the
activities which have been carried on in
Bell Telephone Laboratories in order to
improve the telephone invented by Alex-
ander Graham Bell we have a wonderful
illustration of the manner in which the
results of research can materialistically
develop a particular field. This applica-
tion has claims to distinction in the de-
gree to which it has been possible to in-
tegrate the dictates of the laboratory, fac-
tory, and field in the aim of designing for
continual efficiency in performance of the
telephone.

ALUMINUM INDUSTRY
WAS BORN ON
SMALLMAN
STREET
Alcoa's new
aluminum offk*
V In 1888, the aluminum industry consisted of one company—
located in an unimpressive little building on the east side of
Pittsburgh. It was called The Pittsburgh Reduction Company.
The men of this company had real engineering abilities and
viewed the work to be done with an imagineering eye. But
they were much more than that. They were pioneers . ..
leaders . . . men of vision.
A lot has happened since 1888. The country ... the
company . . . and the industry have grown up. Ten new
territories have become states, for one thing. The total
industry now employs more than 1,000,000 people—
and the little outfit on Smallman Street? Well, it's a lot
bigger, too—and the name has been changed to Alcoa.
Aluminum Company of America . . . but it's still the
leader—still the place for engineering "firsts".
As you prepare to trade textbooks for a position in
industry, consider the advantages of joining a
dynamic company like Alcoa—for real job stability
and pleasant working conditions—where good
men move up fast through their association with
the recognized leaders in the aluminum industry.
We have fine positions for college graduate
engineers—in our plants, sales offices and
research laboratories from coast to coast.
These are positions of responsibility in
production supervision, plant and design
engineering, industrial research or sales
engineering. Right now it may be
quicker than you think from a seat in
the classroom to your career with
Alcoa. Why not find out?
Your Placement Director will be
glad to make an appointment for
you with our personnel represent-
ative. Or just send us an applica-
tion yourself. Aluminum

effort."
He described the graphite-moderated
reactor as a direct descendant of the
graphite-moderated water-cooled reactors
with which we have been producing plu-
tonium at Hanford since 1946.
Forum members were told, however,
that both types of reactor depend on de-
velopment of an adequate long-burn-up
fuel element not yet available.
The effort to develop a satisfactory fuel
element is a major undertaking "with
many aspects and a number of possible
avenues of solution," McCune declared.
Costs of the long-burning fuel, he ex-
plained, would be linked to the rise and
fall of the price of uranium. Further, the
Company anticipates that uranium prices
are likely to decline during the span of
time in which the atomic power industry
undergoes its initial expansion.
In his presentation McCune assumed
that the government will provide enriched
uranium from its gaseous diffusion plants
to the electric utility industry for use as
fuel at fair prices. "It is my opinion that
Congress will make such fuel available to
the power industry," he explained.
Size of the graphite reactor chosen for
the cost estimate was described as quite
large, with a net electrical capability of
700,000 kw. The large size is designed
to achieve economy of operation.
"The graphite reactor is not necessarily
limited to such large sizes," he comment-
ed. "It is possible that it might be cooled
by boiling water which would make it
economic in smaller sizes."
When describing the capabilities of the
graphite reactor, McCune said, "It is our
belief from long experience and extensive
knowledge of what these reactors can be
made to do that they deserve very seri-
ous consideration for power."
During his discusion of the graphite-
reactor estimate, he said that one of the
•more important contributions has been to
provide the industry with a feeling of
certainty that the capital investment will
not be too large to preclude competitive
atomic power.
"The numbers in this estimate are not
speculative," he emphasized. "They are
based on years of experience in the con-
struction and operation of a number of
high-power graphite reactors which we
know can deliver energy reliably with
high-capacity factor.
McCune concluded his address by stat-

ing, "General Electric feels that the time
has arrived when we can look toward
definite goals in the area of commercial
atomic power—goals that can and will
be achieved, and that almost inevitably
will lead to expansion into a power age
of great proportions with resultant bene-
fits to human well-being."
Jet Silencer
Three advanced silencer units for
ground operations of the nation's newest
and most powerful jet airplanes and en-
gines have been added to North Ameri-
can Aviation's sound abatement system at
the company's fighter assembly lines at
Los Angeles International Airport.
The new facilities will be used in
ground operations of the F-100 Super
Sabre, first production airplane capable of
exceeding the speed of sound in normal,
level flight, and for acceptance testing of
its Pratt-Whitney J-57 engines.
Eight other sound reduction units are
in use by North American for ground
operations of the F-86 Sabre Jet series.
The first of the silencers was placed in
operation during 1948, and the other im-
proved units were added with advances
in airplane designs and new developments
in jet power.
The system was built at a cost of more
than $1,600,000.
Largest of the three new silencers is a
$261,000 chamber for testing the J-57
power plants. The jet engine develops
10,000 pounds of static thrust and is the
nation's most powerful.
Engines operating at full power are
barely audible 250 feet from the abate-
ment unit.
Sound of the engine during run-ups is
contained by the chamber's three feet
thick walls. Constructed of corrugated
steel plates one-eighth of an inch thick
and separated by tons of sand, the wall;
are slightly elastic and absorb the sound
energy of the operations.
A 45 foot long muffler, six feet in
diameter, catches more of the sound and
is water-cooled to absorb nearly all of the
3,500 degrees of heat produced by full-
power operations. An automatic water
ring sprays 480 gallons of water a min
ute into the muffler, where the heat so
nearly evaporates the liquid that only l
few wisps of steam are visible from the
chamber's exhaust stack.
Air sucked into the chamber and the
mouth of the powerful jet engine through
6 inlet silencers on the roof of the test
facility. The openings admit 100 pounds
of air each second, enough to change the
air in 50 homes every second.
A bright bar of flame cuts through the
darkened chamber of North American
Aviation's newest sound abatement fa-
cility during after burner operations in
acceptance tests of an F100 Super
Sabre's J-57 jet engine.
The sound of careful pre-flight opera-
tions in the F-100 Super Sabres is sharp-
ly reduced in this sound abatement
chamber.
During the acceptance testing, the en-
gines are operated from two instrument
panels in a control room outside one wall
of the test chamber. Technicians watch the
operations through two large observation
windows constructed of four panels of
bullet-proof glass.
Mirrors mounted on the internal walls
of the chamber give the technicians a clear
view of each external part of the engine.
The two other units for ground opera-
tions of the F-100 Super Sabre utilize
similar test chambers and silencer systems,
and were built at a cost of $85,000 each.
The tail pipe of the Super Sabre is fitted
into an opening in the unit and surround-
ed by a huge "washer" of asbestos cloth.
The engine is operated from the cockpit
of the super-sonic fighter.
The use of corrugated steel plate and i
sand filling for muffling the sound or
operations is duplicated by only one other

YOUR BEARING NOTEBOOK
How to design a freight car
one man can push
You can make a big 5 5-ton freight car roll so easily
one man can push it. How? By mounting its axles on
Timken® tapered roller bearings. Timken bearings
roll the load, eliminate the metal-to-metal sliding
friction that makes old-style friction bearings start
hard. They reduce starting resistance SS%. And, with
Timken bearings, there's no danger of hot boxes
—the major cause of freight train delays.
TIMKEN bearings are
designed to roll the load
As you see here, all lines drawn coincident with the
working surfaces of a Timken bearing meet at a com-
mon point on the bearing axis. This means Timken
bearings are designed to give true rolling motion.
And, since they're tapered they can take radial and
thrust loads in any combination.

Welded Steel Designs Cost
Less Because:
1. Steel it 3 lime* stronger than
gray iron.
2. Steel is 2 V2 times as rigid.
3. Steel costs a third as much as iron.
Ultimate savings are limited only by the
ingenuity of the designer.
IMPROVES APPEARANCE
SIMPLIFIES PRODUCTION
CUTS COST
YOUR success as a designer depends
on your ability to keep costs down
on products you design. By properly
applying the principles of welded steel
construction, cost of manufacture can
be reduced substantially because mate-
rial costs are less, actual production is
simpler. In addition, the product is
stronger, more rugged, has modern
appearance.
The examples show how one designer
has applied the principles of welded steel
to a machine base. The sturdy box-type
construction of the steel design elimi-
nates weight because of steel's greater
strength and rigidity. Considerable ma-
chining, cleaning and finishing of form-
er castings has been eliminated. More
modern in appearance, nevertheless, the
steel design costs 15% less to produce.
IDEAS FOR DESIGNERS
Latest data on designing machinery for
welded steel construction is available to
engineering students in the form of bul-
letins and handbooks. Write:

Other sound abatement units arc built of
concrete and depend on heavier and more
expensive muffler units.
North American's unique structure re-
duces sound energy by the cushioning
effect of the steel plate and sand, a new
concept nicknamed "Elastic-Plastic Mass
Control" by the company's industrial
engineers.
The slight elasticity of the walls allows
the sound energy to be transferred to the
sand filling where the movement of each
grain absorbs and dissipates the force.
The 810 tons of special grade sand be-
tween the walls of the test chamber were
carefully dried before they were poured
in place. Dryness allows freer movement
of the grains.
Safety features installed in the engine
test unit include a device to automatically
sample air in the chamber for critical
mixtures of unburned fuel and oxygen,
and an extensive system of water fog to
combat fire.
Built for economy, each of the three
new units can be dismantled, moved or
modified with minimum time and ex-
pense.
Sperry's "Gyrotron"
The photographer thought it a strange
assignment, taking movies of flies that
couldn't fly. They tumbled and spun,
came in for landings upside down, fell on
their faces, wings, or backs. Yet earlier,
these flies had flown as well as any
Their dizzy acrobatics, he learned, were
due to the rigidity of a glued-up pair of
rods beneath their wings. While these
were unable to vibrate, the insects couldn't
fly level.
The pictures confirmed what Sperry
Gyroscope engineers had discovered about
a new kind of gyroscope, built like a tun-
ing fork. The speed of a turn (called
"rate of turn") affects the vibrating
prongs of the fork, just as it affects the
vibrating, club-shaped "haltere" rods be-
neath the wings of the fly. By a three-way
electrical hook-up at the heel, middle, and
tips, vibrating forks can be used as a
gyroscope. Since the fork does not spin,
it needs no bearings or motor, works
without mechanical friction.
From the very first working model,
Sperry's designers could see that this
apparatus had the potential of measure-
ments impossible for the finest of their
previous spinning, gyroscopic "rate of
turn" indicators—on planes, rockets and
guided missiles.
UM Reactor Gets Green Light
Approval of the Atomic Energy Com-
mission has been received for the alloca-
tion of enriched Uranium to be used in
a nuclear research reactor at the Univer-
sity of Michigan, President HarUr.
Hatcher announced.
The approval gives the University the
green light to proceed with the construc-
tion and operation of what will be po-
tentially the most powerful reactor yet
built in the United States outside of
facilities of the Atomic Energy Commis-
sion provided the U-M abides by the
health, safety and security regulations of
the AEC in the operation of the reactor.
President Hatcher announced the AEC
action before the alumni on the campus
for the 110th Commencement. He said
he had been notified of the approval in 1
letter from Lewis L. Strauss, chairman of
the U. S. Atomic Energy Commission.
The research reactor will be built with
a grant of $1,000,000 from the Ford Mo-
tor Company Fund to the Michigan Me-
morial-Phoenix Project, the University's
wartime memorial which is dedicated to
peaceful uses of atomic energy. The grant
is expected to cover the entire cost of the
reactor and the special building in which
it will be housed.
President Hatcher said the research re-
actor would serve a three-fold purpose:
One, it will be used to teach the design,
theory and operation of reactors. Such
instruction will become increasingly neces-
sary as reactors assume a significant posi-
tion as energy producers in our national
economy.
Two, it will help to expand and broad-
en the University's own research program
in such areas as biology, medicine, metal-
lurgy, physics, chemistry, engineering,
etc.
Three, the reactor will be available for
industrial and governmental research on
a contract basis through the University's
Engineering Research Institute.
The nuclear reactor to be built at the
University will serve primarily as a source
of neutrons and gamma rays, President
Hatcher said. These radiations are pro-
duced when the Uranium nuclei in the
reactor core are fissioned or split on im-
pact by other neutrons. The production of
new neutrons by a reaction which uses

of the "chain reaction" which takes place
within a nuclear reactor.
The Uranium used in this reactor will
be almost pure U235, contained in metal
plates. The assembly of such plates which
comprises the core is kept under 20 feet
of water. The water not only provides a
safe window through which the reactor
can be observed while in operation, but
also acts as an essential working fluid
necessary to sustain the chain reaction. In
addition the water serves to cool the re-
actor. Thus, a very safe combination is
achieved, since if the water is lost, or if
the water boils, the reactor shuts itself
off. However, normally the reactor will
operate at low temperatures so that the
water in the tank does not rise above
100 degrees F. The University installation
is not intended to act as a power plant
but rather as a radiation source for re-
search, the president explained.
The maximum power level for which
the reactor will be designed is 1000
kw. (1350 horse power), he said. Initial
operation will be at the lower power
levels. Even at the maximum power

(Continued from page 50)
levels, heavy shields will keep the radia-
tion level in the building to one-tenth
that considered acceptable by Atomic
Energy Commission standards.
The reactor will be located in a re-en-
forced concrete building on the north
campus adjacent to the Phoenix Memorial
Laboratory now under construction, Dr.
Hatcher reported. The two buildings will
form an integrated laboratory with out-
standing facilities for research on peace-
time uses of atomic energy.
The reactor will be open for inspection,
subject only to restrictions necessary for
public safety.
Design work is now nearing comple-
tion on both the building and reactor. It
is expected that construction will begin
in the fall of 1954. The architectural en-
gineering firm of Smith, Hinchman and
Grylls (Detroit) is preparing plans for
the building and the Atomic Energy divi-
sion of Babcock and Wilcox Company
(Akron, O.) is preparing the engineer-
ing design of the reactor.
Pitted Windshields
Pitted automobile windshields are the
result of normal wear, not the work of
the H-bomb, cosmic rays, industrial sedi-
ment, or Martians.
This is the view of scientists who have
been studying recent cases of "pockmark-
ed" windshields in the Chicago area.
Talk about H-bomb effects merely has
made people more observant about marks
on their windshields, explained John Ki:
Jr., research crystallographer, and Dr.
Walter C. McCrone, senior chemist, both
of Armour Research Foundation of Illi-
nois Institute of Technology, Chicago.
The scientists based their observations
on the examination of approximately 25
samples of shattered and pitted wind-
shields submitted for analysis by Chicago
area motorists.
"We found the marks in nearly every
case to be similar and several months
old," Krc said. "There was no evidence
that the damage was the result of radio-
activity, cosmic rays, air rifles, or other
such causes."
Gravel, dirt, or stones accounted for
every particle scraped from the holes,
they said.
McCrone and Krc do not believe new
curved front windshields are more sus-
ceptible to flying gravel than older types.
"But when a curved rear window is
hit, it may disintegrate more completely
than a flat window," McCrone said.
The "mysterious" honeycombing of
some of the glass samples apparently was
caused by the same thing that produced
pitting—stones thrown up by cars, accord-
ing to the examinations.
Rear windows showed honeycombing,
while front windows were pitted, the sci-
entists explained.
Rear car windows usually are made or
tempered glass purposely strained in con-
struction to give structural strength.
When the surface is broken, they said,
the strain is released and the window
disintegrates into a cobweb pittern.
Front windows, however, are laminated
with plastic as a safety feature to prevent
this. When these are hit the glass is
likely to show pits rather than honeycomb-
ing, they added.

provides year 'round testing in meteorological environments
normally found only in flight. It is the first icing research
tunnel in private industry.
Lockheed thermodynamics scientists were formerly limited to
testing time available at installations such as Mt. Washington.
Now they are able to study in greater detail problems such as:
thermal anti-icing; cyclic de-icing; various methods of ice
removal; distribution of ice; rate of temperature changes in
aircraft components; thermodynamic correlation between lab-
oratory and flight testing; and development and calibration of
special instrumentation.

graduates reveals that members of the
Class of 1929 currently are earning a
median salary of $10,000 to $11,000 a
year.
The survey of five-year classes begin-
ning with the Class of 1929 was con-
ducted by Earl C. Kubicek, director of
alumni relations and placement at Illi-
nois Tech.
"Before the crash, engineering grad-
uates earned an average starting salary of
approximately $115 a month—a lucrative
sum in those days," Kubicek said.
"The 'Black Friday' fiasco virtually
wiped out the engineering job market
and the few jobs that were available paid
a mere pittance," he added.
By 1934, engineering graduates were
receiving an average starting salary of
less than $100 a month. These same grad-
uates today are earning a median salary of
$8,500 to $9,000, according to results of
the survey.
Conditions had improved slightly for
the 1939 engineering graduates who start-
ed at an average monthly salary of $110.
During the intervening years .their me-
dian salary rose to $8,500-$9,000 a year
—four times their starting rate.
The advent of the technological age
and the wartime boom boosted the be-
ginning salary average to $193 when
members of Illinois Tech's 1944 engi-
neering class received their diplomas. In
the short span of 10 years their median
salary increased to $7,500-$8,000, the
survey revealed.
Salaries continued to spiral, and in
1949, IIT engineering graduates were
offered starting salaries of $282 a month.
Five years after graduation, their initial
salary has been doubled in many in-
stances with the class median at $5,500-
$6,000.
Illinois Tech's 1954 graduates were of-
fered an average starting salary of $362.
"Engineers rank with doctors, dentists
and lawyers in the upper income bracket
among college graduates," Kubicek said.
"Even as early as 1947 approximately
52% of the engineering graduates in the
nation were earning $5,500 or more, with
Illinois Tech graduates starting at almost
$20 a month higher than the national
average," he added.
Race with Russia
America is rapidly falling behind Rus-
sia in the race to produce engineers.
IN THE NEWS
(Continued from page 52)
This warning was sounded in a paper
read today at the fall meeting of the
American Society of Mechanical Engi-
neers. Author of the paper was M. H.
Trytten, director of the Office of Scientific
Personnel of the National Research Coun-
cil.
The paper is an outgrowth of nearly
two years of research in conjunction with
the Russian Research Institute at Harvard
University. The full report is scheduled
for publication shortly in book form.
"It seems probable," said Dr. Trytten,
"that the total number of trained engi-
neers in Russia today is closely compar-
able to the number in the United States."
To accomplish this, the Russians have in-
creased the number of engineering grad-
uates from 29,000 in 1948 to more than
50,000 in 1954. In contrast, the United
States graduated only 19,000 engineers in
1954.
Because of Dr. Trytten's illness, the
paper was presented by Thomas A. Mar-
shall, Jr., former secretary of the Engi-
neering Manpower Commission of Engi-
neers Joint Council. Both men are mem-
bers of the ODM Committee on Special-
ized Personnel, which advises Dr. Arthur
Flemming, Director of Defense Mobiliza-
tion, on matters relating to the mobiliza-
tion of scientists, engineers and other
specialists.
Drawing on information obtained from
Soviet sources and statistics covering the
past 30 years, Dr. Trytten stated that the
number of higher educational institutions
in Russia increased from about 750 in
1939 to about 900 in 1952. Enrollment in
these institutions grew to 916,000, an in-
crease of 50 per cent over the same
period.
Even more significant, however, is the
fact that enrollment for professional train-
ing has grown sixfold in the past 25
years, while training of supporting semi-
professional personnel has grown seven-
fold.
"Engineering training" Dr. Trytten
pointed out, "lasts five to five and a half
years, and is based on about 5,000 hours
of lectures, classroom and laboratory in-
struction, attendance at which is manda-
tory."
Soviet professional training begins early
in the secondary schools where "emphasis
is strongly on science and mathematics
for all students. There are no electives
and about 40 per cent of the curriculum
is devoted during the three years to
science and mathematics."
He reminded his audience that perhaps
only 20 per cent of our high-school grad-
uates have had general science courses and
only six to eight per cent have had physics
and chemistry.
According to the author, one of the
major differences between the American
and Russian educational systems rests in
the area of training below professional
levels.
The Russians, he said, have some 3,500
technikums, or technical institutes, offer-
ing three and four year curricula. These
schools have over 1,000,000 students and
are now turning out 350,000 graduates
annually, of which 50,000 are engineer-
ing technicians.
Dr. Trytten warned that local control
of education, which may have been our
greatest strength in the past, may become
a source of weakness in the future "unless
greater awareness of the importance of
education is developed at the local level.'
While concluding that Russia "has ap-
parently solved the vexing problem of the
role of the technical specialist in a very
direct manner," the author urged that we
should not abandon our principles of lib-
eral and broad general education.
To meet the challenge, he advised "im-
proving the teaching of science at the
high school level; expanding the training
of scientists and engineers; and the adop-
tion of a consistent policy for the preser-
vation of professional manpower, espe-
cially engineering and scientific person-
nel."
Dr. Trytten was formerly general chair-
man of the so-called "Trytten commit-
tees," which, up to 1953, advised General
Hershey, Director of Selective Service.
Among other accomplishments, the com-
mittees developed the student deferment
program for the Selective Service System.
Too Fresh to Eat?
In Copenhagen, live trout were anes-
thetized, shock-frozen at 40 below, stored
for four months, defrosted, and placed
in water, whereupon they were found to
be alive and swimming, Food Engineer-
ing reports. Noting that the British ac-
complished the same type of experiment
with warmblooded animals (hamsters),
the publication comments that it is fine
for frozen fish and meat to be fresh—but
not so fresh that it flops off the plate or
walks across the table.

materials and fluid mechanics. But Engineering Mechanics does not end with these conventional courses.
Students who major in this field take advanced work in mathematics, elasticity, plasticity, dynamics, vibra-
tions, fluid dynamics and thermodynamics. Such courses stress the fundamental approach to these subjects,
and provide the training necessary to solve the complex problems which exist in modern technology.
The telephone cable shown above presents a typical research problem in mechanics. These cables
vibrate at large amplitudes in a strong wind. Here, in one problem, many of the fundamental subjects in
mechanics are solved. Solution of this problem requires a knowledge of the effect of the wind on the cable
cross-section (fluid mechanics), the equations of motion of the cable (dynamics), the action of dampers on
the cable (vibrations), and the stresses in the cable due to the motion (strength of materials).
The Engineering Mechanics graduate is often intimately associated with the most modern developments
in engineering and science and like other engineers, many have found their way into management and
ownership. The College of Engineering pioneered in offering a degree program in Engineering Mechanics
and has educated many men, including numerous reognized leaders, in this field.

THE EDITOR GRIPES
During orientation week the Michigan Daily published a
38 page supplement designed to aid incoming freshmen in
their campus orientation. As a part of the Publications
Supplement of this issue, the Daily devoted four paragraphs
to a description of the Michigan Technic. Let me quote:
Although Scientific American may have certain
attributes that the Michigan Technic lacks, the engi-
neering students who produce this campus publica-
tion aren't sure what they are.
Technic, the only University student publication
which is not produced in the Student Publications
Bldg., comes out monthly and is concerned with the
field of science.
Featuring scientific articles and reports of engi-
neering research, the magazine is put out by the
engineers in hopes of providing their classmates with
the "culture' 'they are lacking.
Faculty members and engineering college alumni as
well as students write for the Technic, but editing,
photography, leg work and advertising sales are
handled by the student staff. The major portion of
Technic sales are made in the Engineering Arch.
Aside from the fact that this bit contains a few inac-
curacies, and is rather inferior journalism from a mechani-
cal point of view, the impression it gives of engineers (and
the Michigan Technic) is not altogether favorable.
It would be quite easy to lambast some Daily scribe for
the incompetent writing and whatthehell attitude shown
here, but rather undiplomatic to do so. Besides a sort of
masochistic impulse makes me want to look around at my
fellow engineers and see what the devil we could have done
to deserve that third paragraph.
". . . the magazine is put out by the engineers in hopes
of providing their classmates with the "culture" they are
lacking." What is this "culture" that we are lacking (that
the Technic is trying to provide)? If technical articles,
engineering news, and our brand of humor is intended to
fulfill the engineer's need for culture, then I've been grossly
misled. I thought we were just trying to be informative, a
little amusing, and, perhaps, trying to build up our class-
mates' interest in technical periodicals.
Now all this, of course, is arguing beside the point; be-
cause, since the writer of this paragraph has probably never
read the Technic, the "culture" that he believes lacking in
engineers has nothing technical about it: he's refering to
the culture exemplified by an appreciation of music, litera-
ture, and the arts as well as an awareness of Western
history, philosophy, politics, and economics. If this is the
"culture" engineers are lacking, then I have no choice but
to concede: we are lacking in this.
But, it has always seemed a little strange to me that those
who devote their whole working day to a liberal education
(and to the pursuit of "culture"), should decry the lack of
culture of those whose opportunity for cultural activity is
limited by their leisure time. This is illogical and incon-
siderate. Most engineering students are glad of any oppor-
tunity to work non-technical courses into their curriculum.
They feel the need of a liberal education, but many of them
are too busy learning to build automobiles, airplanes, and
other gadgets to get this education.
So, what are we going to do? If we believe that a liberal
education is desirable, and that the best way to get this
education (I didn't say the only way) is through a college
curriculum, then we are stuck on the horns of a dilemma.
Either the training period for engineers is lengthened to
include more non-technical subjects (which would increase
the cost of an engineering education and slow the output
of new engineers), or the liberal education of engineers is
left up to the engineers themselves, hoping that they'll pick
up their "culture' 'as they go along. (This would be a very
inefficient method; a hateful thing to a good engineer.)
Well, I can't offer any solution, I can merely pose the
problem. It is a bad situation and attempts are being made
to work it out. Until it is worked out, a little more under-
standing and tolerance from across the campus would be
appreciated.

speaks from experience when he says ...
"United States Steel
offers unlimited opportunities covering
practically all engineering fields"
IN 1949 Robert L. Schneider gradu-
ated from college with degrees in
engineering and physics. After being
interviewed by United States Steel, he
was accepted as a trainee. Then after
a year, he was advanced to a test engi-
neer in the Maintenance Department;
then to a power foreman in the Power &amp;
Fuel Division. By 1953, he had been
made Power Superintendent in the
Power &amp; Fuel Division at the Carrie
Furnaces.
As superintendent, he is responsible
for the operation and maintenance of
power producing and distributing facili-
ties for the plant which supplies elec-
trical power to several of our largest
steel mills around Pittsburgh. Such ad-
vancement is not unusual at U.S. Steel.
As for the future, Schneider says,
"Opportunities are unlimited. U.S.
Steel is such a large and diversified or-
ganization that the future is not re-
stricted to your current department or
division. Transfer to equal or better
positions in numerous other divisions is
always possible."
To all future graduate engineers Mr.
Schneider says, "U.S. Steel offers the
best opportunity to get an overall pic-
ture of and experience in industry to-
day. U.S. Steel is big enough to cover
practically all engineering fields and

Manufacturing Engineering at Worthington
After completing his general training which brought him in
contact with all departments, Richard J. Conway decided that
manufacturing engineering was his field. He says, "I chose the
Manufacturing Engineering Department after completing my
general training at Worthington because as a graduate in In-
dustrial Engineering I can learn the practical aspects of my
field while applying theory I learned in college.
"The personnel of this department work together as a team
toward the solution of the numerous problems which arise
daily. We have the cooperation of all other departments in the
corporation in getting the necessary facts pertinent to the solu-
tion of these problems. In the course of our day it may be
necessary for us to meet the Plant Manager, Chief Engineer,
Comptroller, several department heads, clerks, foremen, ma-

"I have contributed to the solution of many problems han-
dled by this department including metal spraying, machining
procedures, purchasing new equipment and designating proper
dimensions to obtain desired fits between mating parts.
"I enjoy my work because I'm doing the work I want and
my formal education is being supplemented with practical
knowledge gained from the tremendous wealth of knowledge
available to me at Worthington. I know from personal contact
with many other departments in the Corporation that Wor-

will give them the same opportunities as have been afforded me."

SUPPLY LOW DEMAND HIGH
Just four years ago engineering grad-
uates flooded the market. Not two years
later, after a "police action" and some
ill-considered de-emphasis of engineering
education, there was a serious shortage
of engineers. The shortage is still with
us. though not as acute, and will probably
continue for a number of years before
things level off.
The simple supply and demand law
of economics works for manpower as
well as coffee, used cars, and lima beans.
As the supply becomes short the demand
i;oes up—and with it the price. As the
engineer shortage became critical, indus-
tries started competing for the men they
wanted, and engineering starting salaries
were jacked up until they produced a pay
scale which now ranks second among the
rr.ajor professions.
What does the graduating engineer
think of all this? He likes it—very well
indeed. He'll never go hungry.
Two Wars and the Draft
Created the Shortage
Korea brought the shortage to light
dramatically, and quickly. But even had
there been no Korean action, the short-
ape would have been felt. During World
War II, as well as during Korea, draft
deferments rested on the discretion of
local draft boards. Their policies were
often indiscriminate and often not in ac-
cordance with the national interest. Many
prospective engineers were drafted be-
fore they finished college; graduating
classes were small. This condition existed
despite the fact that during these war
years the demand was at an all-time high.
After World War II, ex-GI's flooded
engineering schools of the country, many
of them returning to finish up but many
more starting as freshmen. In 1949 over
■16,000 engineers were graduated. In 1950
the total rose to over 50,000. There just
»ere not that many engineering jobs
available, especially since the nation was
just recovering from a mild recession.
The huge graduating classes of 1949
and 1950 prompted the Bureau of Labor
Statistics of the Department of Labor
to issue a report entitled Employment
Outlook for Engineers which intimated
by HENRY LEFEVRE
Reprinted from S C Engineer. Oct. 1954
that the supply of engineers would soon
far exceed the demand. As a result, high
school and college counselors began to
discourage students from taking engineer-
ing. National weekly publications pitched
in too. This concerted effort to reduce
engineering enrollment produced the de-
sired result, but the balance was swinging
too far. A certain "police action" sud-
denly spotlighted how thin the cake was
being sliced.
In 1951 Korea had exploded and the
demand for engineers became monstrous.
But the supply of new graduates had
dropped to less than 40,000 per year, and
a big portion of these were being hand-
ed a "Greetings" along with a sheepskin.
Since then there's been a "helluva short-
age of engineers," as Fortune magazine
put it.
An extensive advertising campaign has
been in progress since the crucial days of
1950 and 1951 to boost the size of engi-
neering graduating classes. The early esti-
mates of these critical years indicated
that from 1953 on less than 20,000 men
would be graduated each year. However,
thanks to the efforts of the Engineering
Manpower Commission and other inter-
ested bodies, these figures are being
proven wrong. Over 22,000 engineers
are expected to graduate in 1955, 29,000
in 1956, and 30,000 in 1957 (see chart).
Five years of intensive effort by officials
ranking from the President down have
started the correction of a serious national
deficiency.
Selective Service
No Longer Selective
Although deferments for undergrad-
uate students are numerous enough to
keep qualified men in school until they
get their bachelor's degree, the policy on
post-graduate and industrial deferments
adopted by Selective Service Officials has
helped to keep the shortage of engineers
with us. The concept of universal military
training is taking precedence over selec-
tive service in official thinking. Nowadays
everyone hears the call to duty.
The picture is like this. A student en-
tering engineering studies stands a good
chance of getting his bachelor's degree
before donning a uniform. Criteria for
deferment are class standing or attain-
ment of an acceptable score on the Selec-
tive Service College Qualification Test.
Under this program about 160,000 stu-
dents are deferred. This is about 12%
of the male college enrollment of over
1,400,000. By the time he is a senior
and his deferment is approaching ter-
mination he had better start thinking
in olive drab. Righ now 77% of seniors
are either in ROTC or vulnerable to the
draft. About a quarter of these will be
commissioned under the enlarging ROTC
program, but the rest will get a new draft
card with lA stamped on it. The Armed
Service seems to be partial to technical
men; although only 1 % of the total labor
force consists of scientists and engineers,
almost 3% of the Armed Forces person-
nel are scientists and engineers. From
these figures one might deduce that engi-
neering health is quite good.
If our typical student should be for-
tunate enough to get a deferment for
graduate work, his chances of completing
the work get slimmer and slimmer as the
times passes. Local boards are quite prone
to fill their quotas with half-baked grad-
uate students these days. Many schools
have had to rely on foreign students to
a large extent to take the graduate assist-
antships.
Should our typical student make it
into a vital industry where he is liable to
get an occupational defferment, he is still
far from being untouchable. Since mid-
1952 the decline in these deferments
has been rapid, averaging about 700
per month (see chart. Our man may
be among the 11% who have held oc-
cupational deferments for three years
or more, but until he is 35 he will have
to renew his deferment continually. Even
the old out of raising a family is no
longer good; deferments for fatherhood
have been eliminated. However, of the
23,872 who had occupational deferments
as of October of last year, 42.3% were
engineers. Of these about half were en-
gaged in production and maintenance of
aircraft, ships, and ordnance. So if un-
touched friend is still sans uniform, the
chances arc- he is fairly close to having

one on, probably working for Civil Ser-
vice on a post or base. At age 35 and
with a flock of children (who wouldn't
have done him any good anyhow), he
can say he ran the gauntlet and made it.
The ones that don't make it, the ones
that are called up from graduate work
and from industry, definitely contribute-
to the shortage. Although engineers are
released from active duty every day to
return to their old jobs or studies, these
returnees do not square the account.
The fact that less and less people are
getting deferred, means that the short-
age gets more imposing. More go in
than come back under this attitude of
Selective Service which is becoming less
and less selective and more and more like
universal military training. The solution
to the shortage, despite its origins, is the
education of more engineers.
How Long Will It Last
Will this enlagement program glut
the market as it did in 1949. Maynard
M. Boring, Manager of General Elec-
tric's Technical Personnel Division an-
swers this question with an emphatic
"No." According to Mr. Boring, the
United States needs 30,000 new graduate
engineers each year for normal indus-
trial operation, plus another 10,000 to
12,000 graduates to take care of defense
needs. This adds up to 42,000 en-
gineering graduates needed annually. If
current estimates are correct, United
States colleges will not graduate enough
engineers to satisfy the peace time seg-
ment of this total until 1957; so engi-
neers will be at a premium for many
years to come.
The shortage of engineers has had its
bright side for industry—it has encour-
aged the more effective use of tech-
nical personnel. Companies short of en-
gineers frequently found that support-
ing personnel could do many of the rou-
tine jobs previously handled by engineers.
However, the serious aftermath of the
shortage is that many research projects
have been delayed or abandoned in order
that production might be maintained.
Standards have been lowered, resulting in
less capable men working on important
projects.
Communist Competition
These facets of the engineering short-
age have international implications. The
United States prides itself as being the
world leader in scientific and engineering
development. The Russians, who are now
challenging our position by developing
and producing comparable military equip-
ment, are surpassing us in the production
of engineers. In 1953, Russia graduated
43,000 engineers while the United States
graduated 24,000. The overall picture is
not so dark, however, since Russia has a
total of only 400,000 engineers in her
labor force while the United States has
500,000.
Communist China, too, is making a
strenuous bid for recognition in the field
of engineering education. Over 70,000
students are currently enrolled in China's
engineering colleges, with the number
expected to increase rapidly. Only about
3% of the 1953 university students were
permitted to take courses in fine arts,
law, or political science. Engineering,
agriculture, architecture, and chemistry
are the "recommended" subjects.
This new Chinese educational program,
initiated in 1951, is aimed at turning
out between 150,000 and 200,000 'senior
construction cadres" during the next five
years.
The caliber of the Chinese engineering
graduate produced by this highly acceler-
ated program is questionable. However,
there is reason to assume that Russian
schools are producing incompetent engi-
neers. Math, Physics, and Chemistry con-
stitute about 25% of the Russian second-
ary school curricula, stressing the fact
that science and technology occupy a
prominent place throughout their educa-
tional system. Inadequate pre-college
training in these subjects is one of the
reasons many of our own freshmen engi-
neers wash out of college.
The rigid scholastic requirements of
American engineering schools have done
much to scare out prospective engineer-
ing students.

The mortality among engineering stu-
dents is not excessive according to an
article written by Henry H. Armsby in
the November 1953 issue of Higher Edu-
cation, the monthly publication of the
United States Department of Health,
Education, and Welfare.
This article was based on a survey
covering 101 engineering colleges, and
more than 13,000 freshmen entering in
1948. Of the entering students covered
by the survey, 33% were graduated as
engineers in four years, or had satis-
factorily completed four years of a five
year program of engineering studies;
11% were still enrolled in engineering;
and 56% had withdrawn or had been
dropped from engineering.
An earlier survey made by the Edu-
cation Testing Service of the Office of
Education agreed quite closely with these
results, and gave additional data on other
student groups.
The Educational Testing Service showed
the following figures:
% Dropped or
Major % Graduating Withdrawn
Commerce and business 24 67
Arts and Sciences 29 67
ENGINEERING 30 62
Home Economics 31 65
Agriculture 34 60
Education 42 53
Occupational Deferments
July 1951 to April 1954
1951 1952 1955 195*
Source: Selective Service System
However, these figures do not take
into account variations in the caliber of
students taking different majors, nor do
the)- recognize the fact that many of
the art, commerce, business, and home
economic students are women, more in-
tent on finding a husband than on get-
ting a degree.
Additional statistics from the 1948-52
survey, show that 56% of the with-
drawals occurred during the engineer's
freshman year, 28% during his sopho-
more year, 11% during his junior year,
and 4% during his senior year. From
these data it is quite evident that proper
preparation for college engineering will
do much to decrease the number of stu-
dents flunking out, and even help im-
prove the caliber of students graduating
from engineering colleges.
Most engineering colleges require three
units of high school mathematics and one
unit of either physics or chemistry as a
bare minimum for entering freshmen.
However, students who have had addi-
tional mathematics and science enjoy a
definite advantage.
In view of these extensive pre-engi-
neering requirements, it is easy to see that
much of the engineer recruiting must be
performed in the high school. Math and
science teachers in these high schools are
traditionally the best recruiters.
Ratio of Workers to Engineers
Incentives Are Good
What do the recruiters have to offer
a young engineer? Money, position, pres-
tige, and a lot of hard work.
According to Henry J. Taylor, "Forty
per cent of industrial management is en-
gineer trained, replacing both the lawyer
and the banker in top industrial posts."
Mr. Taylor elaborates on this by show-
ing that thirteen presidents of United
States Steel's subsidiary companies started
as engineers; ten presidents of associated
companies in the Bell Telephone system
have engineer degrees; at least 15 top
executives of Anaconda Copper and its
major subsidiaries are graduate engineers.
Engineers, in general, make very good
money. They are the second best paid
major profession, being surpassed only
by medical doctors. Doctors, however,
spend much more time in school; they
have a large investment in equipment;
a shorter life expectancy, thus shorter
time in which to earn; and they work
long, irregular hours.
A 1952 income and salary survey of
the National Society of Professional En-
gineers, indicated that their member aver-
ages $7850 a year.
These figures are broken down accord-
ing to branch as follows:
Median
Branch , Annual Salary
Chemical $8,910
Mining 8,730
Mechanical 8,250
Electrical '- 7,940
Civil 7,390
Other 8,600
The survey tabulated the earnings of
the top 10% in each branch as follows:
Median
Branch , Annual Salary
for Top 10%
Chemical $19,950
Mining 19,350
Mechanical 18,720
Civil 16,030
Electrical 15,900
Other 19,670
Men do not work for money alone.
Position and prestige are quite important
in the selection of a profession. Engineer-
ing offers both.
The engineer has become indispensible
to national technology. Without his ser-
vices we could not maintain our present
standard of living, let alone improve it.
Our increasing dependence on engineers
is illustrated by the chart which shows
the growth of the engineering profession,
and another which shows the increasing
ratio of engineers to workers. In 1900,
when this country was first becoming an

industrial giant, there were 250 workers
per engineer. In 1950 there were less
than 70 workers per engineer, and the
number of workers per engineer has de-
creased continually without a single ma-
jor setback. This trend is apt to continue
indefinitely, with the increase in the tech-
nical complexity of our industrial ma-
chine. As more engineers become avail-

Much money and manpower are spent
every winter to shovel, scrape, or spread
chemicals in an attempt to clear side-
walks and driveways each time snow
falls or rain freezes on surfaces. These
efforts give only temporary protection
from the hazards caused by snow or ice-
choked surfaces.
Recently, however, there has been an
increasing use of heating pipes embedded
in or under the pavement for permanent
protection against ice and snow. In ad-
dition to removing snow, such systems
solve the disposal problem. After the
snow melts the resulting water evapor-
ates more readily on the warm pavement
and is prevented from freezing.
The melting of snow and ice from all
types of surfaces today is considered not
only practicable but relatively easy to ac-
complish; it promises to be an effective
and economical method for removing and
disposing of these substances.
The following report is based on a
study of fifteen such installations. It ex-
plains the factors that contribute to the
design, installation, and operation of
snow-melting systems for sidewalks and
driveways.
DESIGN
Amount of Heat Required
One of the first factors to be consider-
ed in the design of a snow-melting sys-
tem is the size of the melting job to be
done. The calculation procedure which
follows is based on a recommended nor-
mal melting rate of 1 inch of snow per
hour. Different melting rates can be ob-
tained by revising the computations pro-
portionately. The amount of heat re-
quired to melt snow at the rate of 1 inch
per hour may be computed by the fol-
lowing formula:1
H=AtdF
where H=British thermal units per hour
(Btuh.)
where A = Area to be melted (square
feet)
where t = rate of melting (feet per hour)
where d=density of snow (pounds per
cubic foot)
where F=latent heat of snow or ice
(Btu. per pound)
Three of the four factors in the above
formula can be easily fixed. The factor
"d" is a variable since the density of
snow varies widely, depending on air
temperature during snowfall.
by JOHN KAGAY
In selecting a temperature that would
represent an average value at which most
snowfall occurs, U. S. Weather Bureau
data were consulted. Records of ten
weather stations regarding 27,823 snow-
falls over a period of 10 years, showed
that 87% of all snowfalls occurred in a
temperature range of 10 degrees F to 35
degrees F. The average temperature in
this range was 26 degrees F. Therefore,
to fix the density of snow at an average
value for computations, its density at 26
degrees F. was used. The average density
of snow at this temperature is 5.9 pounds
per cubic foot. Using this figure, a melt-
ing rate of 1 inch per hour, and the latent
heat of fusion of 144 Btu. per pound,
the amount of heat required per square
foot of area for only the melting job
becomes: H = l x 1/12 x 6 x 144 or 72
Btuh. (per square foot).
There is a mean efficiency of 70% for
such a system.2 With 72 Btuh. per square
foot required for melting, addition of
edgewise and downward heat loss factors
results in a total input of approximately
100 Btuh. per square foot of surface to
be cleared.
Assuming that the snow's surface tem-
perature will be nearly air temperature,
it is not considered necessary to make any
allowance for heat loss of this type. Test
work and experience have shown equip-
ment producing 100 Btuh. per squar foot
is sufficient for 1 inch per hour removal.
This figure may be considered for prac-
tical design purposes. In calculating
boiler sizes the total heat of 100 Btuh.
per square foot stands for net boiler out-
put only. Allowances for piping losses
should be added to obtain the gross out-
put.
Pipe Size and Spacing
After estimating the heat required for
the melting job, the next step is de-
termination of pipe size and spacing. It
was the practice, several years ago, to use
-y4" pipe at 18" center to center (C.-C.)
or 1" pipe at 15" C.-C. This spacing
causes melting to occur directly above the
piping, but the slower melting between
the pipes has never been reported ob-
jectionable. These spacings, however,
should be considered maximum for the
two pipe sizes. Closer centers may be
used where more regular melting is de-
sired.
Current engineering practice is cen-
tered on an average water temperature of
160 degrees F. with the temperature-
drop through the system varying from 10
to 30 degrees depending on the size of
the melting area.3 The average unit
should allow a maximum drop of 20 de-
grees.
Use of Hot Water and Steam
Some industrial applications have used
steam. This practice is not considered the
most desirable for many reasons. The
danger of the condensate freezing at the
start of a melting operation exists, ex-
cept for systems where a constant flow
of waste steam is available. Moreover,
the use of intermittently flowing steam
produces an expansion problem. This is
due to excessive temperature differences
when steam first enters the pipes on a
cold day. The installation of heat ex-
changers to provide hot water from ex-
isting steam lines seems to be the prac-
tical solution.4
The majority of units use a separate
boiler, or steam converter, to provide
hot water for snow melting. In some
cases it would be possible to use hot water
from the same boiler that is used for do-
mestic heating, without overloading it.
Most heating systems are designed on the
basis of 0 degrees F. outdoor temperature.
Records show that nearly all snowfalls
occur in the 20 degree F. range. There-
fore the Btu. output not required for do-
mestic (space) heating could be switched
adequately to snow melting.
INSTALLATION
Pipe Placement
The question most frequently asked
about snow-melting installation concerns
location of the piping with respect to the
surface of the area to be cleared. A fast
melting action and efficient system is
obtained with piping near the surface.
However, this practice brings out the
problems of concrete fracture and damage
to piping from heavy loading. The prob-
lem of concrete fracture from rapid ex-
pansion of the piping is not easily

differences.
Installation records show that the ma-
jority of systems consist of piping placed
on top of a prepared fill or base over
which the concrete is poured.5 This re-
sults in the pipe being imbedded to the
extent of 75% in the concrete (slab)
material. When a loose stone fill is used,
the concrete may work its way entirely
around the piping. Such installations,
both hot water and continuous steam,
have run under most severe weather con-
ditions without harm to the slab or
wrought iron pipe used.
Burying pipe in the fill beneath the
slab eliminates all danger of slab frac-
ture. But it also reduces the melting ac-
tion and efficiency of the system. From
both heating and structural standpoints,
the disadvantages of installing piping
either close to the surface or in the fill
indicate that piping placed on the fill
md covered with concrete meets all re-
quirements for an average melting system.
Slab Thickness
Good concrete practice normally calls
for a minimum slab thickness of 4 inches
for sidewalks and 5 inches for driveways
and other areas subject to light loads."
Concrete authorities suggest that 2y2"
be a minimum thickness of concrete above
the piping. This cover is possible with
pipe sizes up to 2" and slab thickness not
less than 5".
The question of damage to embedded
pipe from heavy surface loads can be an-
swered by experience. A number of in-
vestigations revealed that 5 to 10-ton
power rollers had been used to level and
pack an asphalt driveway and no damage
occurred to the wrought iron pipes be-
neath. Thus, unless an extraordinary
weight condition exists, it can be as-
sumed that pipe failure from crushing
is remote.7
Expansion Joints8
Outdoor concrete work normally calls for
many expansion joints. However, struc-
tural engineers are reported to be obtain-
ing good results with fewer joints than
ailed for in the past. But, when expan-
sion joints are planned for concrete, the
use of wrapped expansion loops is feas-
ible. When a plan for expansion or con-
struction joints is involved, the use of
pipe wrapping may be considered. It is
not certain that any of these steps need
be taken.
Additional points pertaining to in-
stallation include: welding pipe to make

Broken stone or gravel are the most de-
sirable for this purpose.
OPERATION
Continuous or Intermittent Operation
One of the major problems under the
heading of operation is whether to oper-
ate a melting system continuously or in-
termittently. With steam as the source
of heat, engineers agree that intermittent
operation is dangerous because of the
possibility of the condensate freezing in
the starting period, and the danger of
over-expansion of firmly embedded pipe.
Steady steam flow will eliminate these dis-
advantages, but is only practical if waste
or exhaust steam is on hand. Continuous-
ly operated steam systems arc among the
most successful from the melting stand-
point because the slab is always well
above freezing and snow never collects
on the surface.
Normally, continuous circulation of
hoth water is not practical. A compro-
mise between intermittent and continuous
operation would be to maintain medium
heat when snow is predicted, and in-
crease the temperature when snowfall
starts. When it is desired to operate a hot
water system only when snow is falling,
or has fallen, the use of a "snow detec-
tor" 'may be practical.8 This device oper-
ates on accumulation of snow (or ice) on

OF AGE IN INDUSTRY
In recent years, power metallurgy has
advanced in the competitive market of
metallic products and became a valuable-
industrial process. The reason is that the
process has been developed to produce
materials of strength as well as precision.
Above all, industry is gratified to be able
to secure such products at a low cost too.
For example, let's take the gear. Manu-
facture of gears requires time and a skill-
ed machinist to perform the operation
from bar stock. The machining expense
will be large and the consumer will be
required to pay. Another method in mak-
ing the part is by a casting operation.
Again the part must be machined to di-
mension. The cost for this process is high
also.
The solution for a low and economical
cost of the gear would be by powder
metallurgy because it is possible to create
the same physical properties with that of
other processes. Any material can be used.
Parts have been made from bronze, brass,
stainless steel, iron and tungsten carbide.
Other materials are being considered but
they are still in the experimental and de-
veloping stages.
It is to be remembered that powder
metallurgy is not a cure-all for all pro-
duction problems. However, it did solve
a large number of them. Because of this,
small industries of powder metallurgy
are growing in all sections of the country.
The process of powder metallurgy is
divided into three sections: briquetting,
sintering, and coining. Briquetting can be
defined as the pressing of a powder in a
condined die cavity in order to produce
a compact which has the shape of the de-
sired article. The operation is illustrated
in Figure 1. The die cavity is filled with
the metallic powder. The upper punch is
then lowered into the die cavity. At that
time, the powder is pressed into shape.
As the upper punch is raised, the lower
punch raises to eject the briquette from
the die cavity. In production, the opera-
tion is mechanical. By using a series of
cams, it is possible to fill the die cavity
with the correct amount of powder, com-
press the powder, and eject the briquette.
The speed of this type of press can be
regulated so the briquette production can
vary from five to sixty compacts per
by WALTER W. RING
minute. Figure 2 shows how the bri-
quettes are mass produced.
Following the briquetting operation,
sintering is the next step. This process is
similar to a heat treatment. The purpose
is to transform a fragile briquette into a
hard material. The temperature used is
far below the melting point of the ma-
terial which is to be heat treated. In Fig-
ure 3, an operator is shown how the part
is placed upon a moving belt which car-
ries the part through the hot zone of the
sintering furnace.
In the furnace is a protective atmo-
sphere to prevent the parts from oxidiz-
ing when the parts are heated to a high
temperature. Carbon dioxide or carbon
monoxide are the two favorable types
because it is possible to manufacture this
type of gas directly from the city gas

INTRODUCTION
For many years legislation granting
statehood to Alaska has been shelved, or
defeated by vote in Congress. But the
consensus of opinion today is that Alaska
will become a state. The main question
now is: When should Alaska be ad-
mitted to the Union? In answer to this
question the following report contends
that Alaska should be granted immediate
statehood.
LEGISLATION FOR ALASKAN
STATEHOOD
The question of whether or not to ad-
mit Alaska to the Union has been before
Congress for many years. The first bill in
Congress advocating statehood for Alaska
was introduced in 1916. Since 1931 form-
er delegate, Dimond, and the present
delegate, Bartlett, have been introducing
similar measures in each congress.1 Some
of the bills have been passed by the Sen-
ate and others by the House, but as yet
the opposition has been strong enough
to prevent congressional approval of any
measure that would grant Alaskan state-
hood.
ORGANIZED OPPOSITION
The two major groups opposed to Alas-
kan statehood are: (1) The salmon in-
dustry and (2) the Southern democratic
bloc in Congress.
Salmon Industry
The canned salmon industry, with
headquarters in Seattle, is definitely op-
posed to statehood. It fears that Alaska's
admission as a state will mean an increase
in taxation and passage of labor regula-
tions restricting its use of cheap, transient
labor in Alaskan canneries. But the in-
dustry's main reason for opposing Alas-
kan statehood is that the use of fish traps
would be prohibited by the State of
Alaska. The Alaskan legislature, which
condemns the use of fish traps as detri-
mental to the supply of salmon, now
has no authority concerning their use.2
Fish traps, which have been abolished by
Canada, Washington, and Oregon, are
used extensively in Alaska by the Sal-
mon industry.
Southern Democrats
The southern Democratic bloc in the
senate noted 23 out of 26 against Alaskan
statehood during a recent vote on the is-
sue. The southerners fear that the Alaskan
by MARK J. HUETER
senators might not share their views on
civil-rights legislation/1
ARGUMENTS AGAINST STATEHOOD
The reasons that many congressmen
oppose Alaskan statehood are varied and
are not entirely without basis. Their main
arguments are: (1) Insufficient popula-
tion (2) Noncontiguous to United States,
and (3) Undeveloped economy.
Insufficient Population
If Alaska is admitted to the Union
it will have the smallest population and
the largest area of any state. The total
population is approximately 160,000 in-
cluding government workers. This does
not meet the minimum number of citi-
zens essential to provide the necessary tax
revenue if Alaska becomes a state.4
Noncontiguous to the United States
Critics of Alaskan statehood point out
that it is too far removed from the con-
tinental United States for its citizens to
be interested in affairs of the entire na-
tion. They also contend that Alaskan con-
gressmen would be interested only in
legislation affecting their state due to its
remote location from the other states.
California and Oregon were granted state-
hood at a time when they were separated
from the remainder of the states by 1500
miles of hostile country. And the only
forms of transportation available were
horses, wagons, sailing ships, and feet.
Undeveloped Economy
The opponents of the statehood bill
maintain that Alaska could not support
the costs of statehood and the additional
federal taxes that would be levied, due to
its undeveloped economy. This is caused
by: (1) Lack of industry, (2) Unim-
portance of agriculture, (3) Transporta-
tion difficulties, and (4) Undeveloped
resources.
Industry. There is practically no indus-
try in Alaska. High labor and transporta-
tion costs have prevented the growth of
industry in the territory.
Agriculture. There are only about 600
farms in the territory, less than the aver-
age agricultural county in the United
States.5 Only a very small percentage of
the land in Alaska is suitable for farming.
Transportation. There is only one rail-
road in Alaska and it is subsidized by the
federal government. The two major high-
ways in the territory are partially paved.
The airplane is the most efficient method
of transport and travel due to the rugged
terrain and lack of adequate highways.
Resources. Alaska's resources have not
been developed because 99:7% of all the
land is owned by the federal government.
Also private corporations have withdrawn
valuable land from use. This comprises
almost all of the best and most valuable
resources known to exist in the territory/'
The weather, tremendous operating costs,
and inaccessability have also hindered de-
velopment of Alaska's natural resources.
QUALIFICATIONS FOR STATEHOOD
The Senate Interior and Insular Affairs
Committee at a meeting on June 29,
1950, approved Alaskan statehood. Their
port states that Alaska meets the tradi-
tionally accepted requirements of state-
hood. The first requirement is that the in-
habitants of the proposed state be sympa-
thetic with our form of government and
have undergone a period of tutilage"
under incorporated territorial status/
That the majority of Alaskans fulfill this
requirement seems very apparent. The
other requirements are: (1) a majority
of the electorate want statehood, (2)
Sufficient population, and (3) Ability of
the territory to carry its share of state and
federal government.
Majority Want Statehood
Alaskans have voted 3 to 2 in favor
of statehood and would accept the pres-
ent bill in Congress.8
Population
Alaska's population is more than a
third of the states had at the time of their
admission.9 Also a marked increase in
population has occurred in each state after
it was added to the Union.
Ability to Assume Responsibilities
of Statehood

CONFERENCE
Every year the four American Foundry-
men's Society chapters of the state of
Michigan and the student chapters at the
University of Michigan and at Michigan
State College conduct the Michigan Re-
gional Conference. This year the confer-
ence was held on the University of Mich-
igan campus at Ann Arbor. The meetings
were held in Rackham Hall, the Union,
and in the Experimental Foundry in
East Engineering Building while speak-
ers came from as far as Virginia and
Missouri and participants included two
former presidents of AFS, the present
vice-president, and many noted authori-
ties in the field.

Floyd R. Smith, President of U of M
Student Chapter of A. F.S., spoke on
"Dimensional Reproducibility and Sur-
face Roughness in the Shell Molding
Process."
This was one conference in which the
students actually did take an active part.
The three featured speakers of the Fri-
day afternoon session were students at
the University and the steak fry Friday
was entirely run by the students. In ad-
dition, many students attended the lunch
and the banquet at the Union on Thurs-
day.
The subject of the talks and discussion
at the conference included such varied
matter as Risering, Gating, Mold Pro-
duction, Cast Metal Research at the Uni-
versity of Michigan, and the Future of
the Industry (It's good!). Some of the
most interesting material was given in
the Friday morning session on Mold
Production. Such items as ramming a
mold in two seconds, elimination of
by STEPHAN KONZ
machining of castings, reducing the ma-
terial handling of a mold from 186 to 18
pounds, and consistently casting to tol-
erances of less than .005 inches/inch were
some of the attributes of the difference
processes described. These were not some
future goal of the industry but the results
of methods now in use. The Friday after-
noon session was mainly devoted to ex-
planation of some of the research being
conducted here. Paul Trojan described a
new test for evaluating cast metal struc-
tures, Floyd Smith explained dimensional
accuracy and surface quality in shell
molds, while Charles Hammond spoke on
graphitization in magnesium treated fer-
rous materials.
Some interesting and unique aspects
of the AFS were given by Bruce J. Simp-
son, National vice-president of AFS, at
the Thursday evening banquet. The sub-
stance of his remarks was that the AFS
is the only foundry group that:
—Spends any substantial amount on
pure research
—Is entirely devoted to technical prog-
ress
—Is available without regard to posi-
tion—from molder to president
—Is international in scope
One of the ideas that recurred through-
out the conference was first uttered by-
Dean G. G. Brown in his opening ad-
dress. He expressed the opinion that the
foundry industry had been controlled in
the past by tradition. At the present time-
there has been a change in thinking so
that while old established practices are
considered, there is no hesitation to
change to something better. Several other
speakers, including F. J. Walls, former
AFS president and James H. Smith, Man-
ager of Central Foundry Division,
G.M.C., also commented on the subject
in their address, pointing out that cast-
ing formerly was an art but is now be-
coming a science thus affirming a need
for more engineers in the casting in-
dustry.

the latest developments but also aided
the students to meet these men and enlist
their sympathy and support.

by R. H. EARLE
Chief Engineer Central Plant, Line Material Company
The engineering student who is about
to graduate and start on his working ca-
reer often is confronted by so many job
openings that he has difficulty in selecting
the best one. Obviously, he wants to
choose the position which offers him the
best opportunity to develop his talents
to the utmost, contribute the most to the
organization he selects, and receive in
return the greatest compensation in the
form of recognition, personal enjoyment
in his work, and his salary.
The young engineer's problem bears
a striking similarity to that of a man who
has some money to invest on a long-term
basis and wishes to purchase common
stock in the business concern which will
give him the greatest return over the
long pull.
Investment counsellors have some
guides that they follow in advising pros-
pective investors. The counsellors point
out, as good investment possibilities, com-
panies that are in a growing and an es-
sential industry, have financial stability,
and are operated by a seasoned manage-
ment. It is interesting to see if these
same guides could not be followed by the
young engineer selecting a job.
One of the first things the young engi-
neer and the investor have to decide is
to what degree they wish to speculate be-
cause there is no such thing in the busi-
ness world as absolute security, either for
the money invested in a business or for
the men that make up the organization.
The investor who is young, healthy,
and financially independent, even during
emergencies, can afford to take greater
risks with his common stock fund than
could, for example, an older man with
family responsibilities, limited resources,
and few years to recover from any finan-
cial loses he might experience. Likewise,
the young engineer who is healthy and
financially independent can afford to take
a greater risk in the selection of a job
than a young man who is married, has a
family, and is solely dependent upon his
monthly salary.
I believe that most young engineers
and most long term investors in common
stocks can take a so-called "businessman's
risk," because they are both looking for
a moderate amount of security. Engineers
and investors seek an opportunity for
progress through growth of the com-
pany with which they are associated.
At this point it might be interesting to
trace the history of a typical company or
typical industry in our economic system
today.
The usual pattern is for the early stages
of an industry to be quite hazardous from
a financial standpoint and very specula-
tive for both the investors and the em-
ployees. For example, the very earliest
railroads that were built shortly after the
steam locomotive was invented were very
hazardous ventures and, undoubtedly,
much money and many jobs were lost in
the early stages.
Very often in these early stages there
is not a market yet for the product being
sold. Further there has not been engi-
neering design data accumulated to the
point that a thoroughly satisfactory prod-
uct can be designed and produced. The
result is likely to be frequent customers'
complaints and consequent losses from
replacing defective products. As the in-
dustry and the companies in it gain more
experience, establish a market for the
product, and accumulate know-how and
facilities, a reasonable measure of sta-
bility gradually evolves. The industry
then enters a so-called "growth" period.
If the product or service has a wide ap-
peal, the market develops rapidly, and
for some years shows no sign of satura-
tion. During this period the industry and
the companies in it are likely to grow at
a more rapid rate than business in general.
Gradually as enough companies get into
the business to supply the market ade-
quately, the market approaches a ceiling
and is ultimately made up of two parts:
first in the replacement of products that
have already been sold and have been
worn out in service; second in supplying
new buyers who have never owned the
product before. This latter part of the
market is pretty well geared to the in-
crease in population. As conditions
change and new products gradually super-
sede the existing product, the market
levels off and then begins to decline. The
classic example is the buggy whip busi-
ness which was undoubtedly thriving 100
years ago but has now practically disap-
peared because of the automobile super-
seding the horse and buggy.
The foregoing history is quite typical
of most industries and the companies that
form it.
Sometimes as an industry starts to de-
cline, alert manufacturers recognize trends
away from their original field of en-
deavor and branch out into new fields,
but many do not and ultimately become
casualties in the business world. This, of
course, results in loss to the holders of
common stocks and the employees who
have made up the organization. This typi-
cal industry pattern having a speculative
start, then a period of growth, the reach-
ing of the zenith, and ultimate decline,
is recognized by investment counsellors
and could well be kept in mind by the
young engineer selecting his first job.
In general, not very many investors
nor very many young engineers can afford
to take the chances of the extremely
young industries and companies. It is true
that our great companies of today were
at one time extremely small, and those
investors and employees who stayed with
them have made fabulous profits or have
advanced into high positions through the
growth of the company.
The risk of such situations is well il-
lustrated by the dozens of automobile
companies which were formed and went
bankrupt in the early days of that indus-
try. Out of those early troubled times
have grown the great automobile com-
panies of today, some of which rank
among our most stable enterprises. Manu-
facturing automobiles is no longer a
particularly speculative line of business;
investments and jobs with these com-
panies compare favorably in security with
our other leading lines of business.
If a person has the emotional make-up
to be happy in very speculative situations,
he can consider joining an organization

PROF. VICTOR STREETER
A newcomer to the University of
Michigan's department of Civil Engineer-
ing is Prof. Victor L. Streeter. His ap-
pointment fills the need for a specialist
in the field of fluid mechanics.
Prof. Streeter might be regarded as one
of the foremost men in this field. He is
author of two books on the subject: Fluid
Dynamics (1948) and Fluid Mechanics
(1951). In addition, he has contributed
articles to professional technical journals
and has written chapters for the Hand-
book of Engineering Fundamentals and
Engineering Hydraulics.
This will be Prof. Streeter's first re-
turn to his alma mater since he was grad-
uated in 1931. He earned his Doctor of
Science degree here in 1934. When his
studies were over they were actually just
beginning because one year later he was
Victor Streeter
awarded the ASME scholarship and
studied in Germany for one and one
half years.
The following year he was the recipient
of the Freeman Travel Scholarship and
studied hydraulic laboratory practice
around the world.
In the summer of 1941, after serving
on the International Boundary Commis-
sion, he was appointed to the faculty of
the Illinois Institute of Technology as a
research professor and director of funda-
mental fluid research.
The Armour Research Foundation
made him chairman of the Fluid Me-
chanics and Thermodynamics section in
1944. Prof. Streeter's travels took him to
New Zealand in 1952 where he studied
and lectured under a Fulbright Visiting
Professorship.
As might be expected, Prof. Streeter's
scholastic and professional honors are
many. He is a member of ASCE, ASME,
and ASEE in addition to Sigma Xi, Phi
Kappa Phi, Iota Alpha, and Chi Epsilon.
PROF. HARROLD A. OHLGREN
Mr. Harold A. Ohlgren is one of the
newer College of Engineering faculty
men on the campus. Mr. Orlgren brings
with him to Michigan a wealth of indus-
trial experience in several phases of
chemical and nuclear engineering ex-
perience gained while he held a series of
engineering positions in several com-
panies.
As assistant director of the Engineer-
ing Research Institute Mr. Ohlgren's du-
ties are varied but one of the most im-
portant projects on which he is working
is the Industrial Program of the College
of Engineering. Under this program in-
dustrial organizations will be invited and
encouraged to participate in the research
activities conducted by the College of
Engineering.
Concurrently with the Industrial Pro-
gram Mr. Ohlgren is supervising other
projects in the Engineering Research In-
stitute, particularly several projects con-
cerned with the application of chemical
engineering operations to problems aris-
ing in nuclear power reactor design. Mr.
Ohlgren also holds a professorship in
the Department of Chemical and Metal-
lurgical Engineering. He teaches a grad-
uate level course on the design, operation
and economic evaluation of chemical and
process plants.
Mr. Ohlgren was born in Cokato,
Minnesota, a small town some fifty miles
west of the twin cities of Minneapolis
and St. Paul. At Cokato High School he
participated in athletics and debate ac-
tivities, majored in mathematics and
physics and graduated in 1932. From
1932 until 1936 Harold attended Macal-
ester College in St. Paul. At Macalester
he majored in mathematics, physics and
chemistry and graduated cum laude in
1936. He then entered the University of
Minnesota and completed the course work
for the doctorate in physics. At Minnesota
he did work in neutron counting and
electron spectroscopy and taught courses
in mechanics, heat, light and electricity.
In addition to this academic work he was
simultaneously employed as a consulting
chemist for an industrial concern in St.
Paul. From 1938 until 1942 he was
president and general manager of an oil
refinery and had charge of development
engineering and production for the com-
pany. During this period he became ac-
quainted with and proficient in the opera-
tions of chemical engineering.
Harold Ohlgren
During and after the war Mr. Ohlgren
was chief chemical process engineer for
one of the nations largest engineering
and construction firms and was responsi-
ble for the design of many production
plants in several branches of the chemi-
cal and process industries. In 1948 he
became executive director of operations
for a large chemical company and for
two years was in charge of research and
development, purchasing, engineering,
and production cost control for the com-
pany's twenty-six plants in the continen-
tal United States.
In 1950 Mr. Ohlgren went to Oak
Ridge, Tennessee to expedite the con-
struction of chemical separation plants
for the Atomic Energy Commission and
in 1951 became Chief Engineer and As-

In recent years, the aircraft industry
has made tremendous advances in the
speeds of jet propelled aircraft, rocket
propelled aircraft, and guided missiles.
Engineers in the field of aviation are
now faced with a problem that must be
solved before further substantial increases
in speed of future aircraft can be real-
ized. The problem is the lack of materials
that can withstand weakness caused by
heat, corrosive atmosphere, radiation, and
stress at supersonic speeds.
This report is intended to give future-
engineers a basic knowledge of one of
the many problems confronting the aero-
nautical engineer at the present time. Al-
though titanium is one metal that shows
promise, the problem is far from solved,
and this report might give the future
engineer an idea of the problem and
on which he may work.
IMPORTANCE OF THE NEED FOR
HEAT RESISTANT MATERIALS
The excessive heat in supersonic air-
craft is due mostly to two main causes.
The first is the terrific heat generated by
jet and rocket engines. Nuclear reactors
are being considered for aircraft power-
plants. The shortage of heat resistant
metals would be even more acute if this
source of power was used for the propul-
sion of aircraft.
The second cause is aerodynamic heat-
ing. In other words, it is the heat caused
by the friction of air being compressed
by aircraft surfaces during high speed
flights. When speeds are reached of ap-
proximately MACH 4 (four times the
speed of sound at sea level), there be-
comes a sharp increase in structural tem-
peratures.
Research aircraft at present are ap-
proaching speeds of MACH 2. Surface
temp, o fa jet traveling at 1400 mph
rises to 600 degrees Fahrenheit. The
Douglas X-3 built for the USAF was de-
signed to reach speeds up to 1320 mph.
Large sections of the X-3 are made of
titanium, especially parts that get heat
from the engines as well as from aero-
dynamic heating. The skin temp, of a
missile during sustained flight at MACH
4 at 40,000 ft. reaches 900 degrees
Fahrenheit. Burner liners, transition
ducts, and parts of exhaust tail cones in
turbine engines are exposed to temp,
ranging from 1200 degrees Fahrenheit.
by RAYMOND KOS
Thermal stresses result which tend to
produce buckling and cracking. With
aircraft approaching these terrific speeds,
it is obvious that the solution of this
problem is of utmost importance.
EFFECTS OF EXCESSIVE HEAT ON
METALS
Excessive heat causes three major ef-
fects on present aircraft materials.
Reduction of Basic Strength
Metals exposed to high temperature
show a marked decrease in strength. In
general, aluminum alloys lose half
strength at 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Ti-
tanium alloy and steel alloys lose half
strength at approx. 800 degrees Fahren-
heit and 850 degrees Fahrenheit, respec-
tively.

Creep Tendencies
At elevated temperatures, metals tend
to stretch under the action of an unchang-
ing load. This tendency is callel creep.
The useful life of an airplane is therefore-
limited by excessive distortion of the
wings after continued flight at high temp.
The creep lifetime of a structure can vary-
between thousands of hrs. and a few
seconds.
Thermal Stresses and Buckling
Aerodynamic heating creates another
problem when an aircraft or missile struc-
ture is subjected to rapid heating and por-
tions of the structure undergo rapid
changes in temp. The temp, distributions
in the structures become uneven causing
thermal stresses and buckling. This can
change the effective stiffness of the metals
causing the aircraft to flutter. Planes that
develop flutter due to aerodynamic heat-
ing become useless.
DIFFICULTIES IN SOLUTION OF
PROBLEM
Attempts to solve this problem were
brought under way in two ways.
Cooling
An airborne refrigeration system for
the Douglas X-3 was developed. It uses
evaporation in conjunction with an air
cycle refrigeration turbine to create a
compact, reliable system. It cools the
pilot, some equipment, and compart-
ments. This was impractical as a solution
to the whole- problem because of several
reasons.
The cooling apparatus is bulky and
adds weight to the aircraft, thereby cut-
ting down speed. It is practically impos-
sible for a refrigeration unit such as this
to cool the whole aircraft. Since the
whole aircraft gets hot from aerodynamic
heating, this cooling system is deficient
in that respect.
If the cooling apparatus should cease
to function during a high speed flight, it
would bring about drastic results. The
plane would disintegrate- because of its
lack of heat resistant qualities.
The refrigeration system has one ad-
vantage however. Since heat resistant
metals could not cool the pilot, this is the
only method by which the pilot's cockpit
could be kept at a temp, low enough for
the pilot to survive.
Development of Heat-Resistant Metals
The availability of necessary materials
is limited and very costly. Also present al-
loys have definite temp, limitations. Fuels
are available to provide- necessary operat-
ing temp, for more powerful and efficient
gas turbines, but present blading materials
do not retain the desired engineering
properties at temp, exceeding 1600 de-
grees Fahrenheit. The big problem re-
mains that of producing material that is
both light and heat resistant. Aluminum
gets too hot at sea level speeds of 1000
mph and is no longer used on the fastest
planes.
TESTS UNDER INVESTIGATION
Investigations are being made on heat-
ing metals to the equivalent of MACH
10 or 6600 mph in an attempt to find a

Ten men between the ages of 26 and 40 were featured
in a recent national magazine article which presented a
portrait of the young scientist in America today. These
particular men are a sample of the most brilliant young
scientific minds in industry.
It's interesting to note that three of the ten arc
with Bell Telephone Laboratories, three with General
Electric and one each with four other companies.
The variety of opportunity in research and other
phases of telephone work has always attracted an un-
usually high percentage of the nation's best young men.
Consult your Placement Officer about opportunities
with Bell Laboratories . . . also with the Bell Telephone
Companies, Western Electric and Sandia Corporation.
Your Placement Officer will be glad to give you details.

Then, Now and Tomorrow
by FRANK H. PROUTY, P.E., Chairman, National Bureau of Engineering Registration
Reprinted from American Engineer, Sept. 1954
To a state legislature, engineering reg-
istration is a means of protecting the life,
health and property of the public. Legal
registration permits only those engineers
who can safely serve the public to practice
and denies such responsibility to those
who are incompetent.
To engineers, registration also repre-
sents a struggle to obtain professional
recognition. Lawyers and doctors are now
100 per cent registered and they consti-
tute the definition of "professional recog-
nition." You can't prescribe medicine or
perform an operation unless you are a
registered physician and you can't even
draw a will for someone else unless you
have passed the bar examination.
It was not always thus. Once kings ap-
pointed physicians and not too long ago
a judge could examine an applicant in
open court and admit him to the bar.
Once engineering was classed as just a
guild and surveying as a trade. The first
engineering diplomas were products of
inadequate text books and untrained in-
structors and the best thing a new college
graduate could do was to apprentice him-
self to a graduate of the school of hard
knocks. His first assignment was usually
to try to forget what he had learned in
college.
Then came better text books, better
trained professors and engineering regis-
tration laws. Today the status of an engi-
neer passed by a state examining board is
raised to a professional level. The organi-
zation which limits its membership to
registered engineers has a perfect right
to call itself, "The National Society of
Professional Engineers." If every engineer
capable of registration would register and
if everyone so registered would join this
National Society, then the engineers could
acquire a society with full professional
status. Public acknewledgment of such
statu^ would automatically accompany
membership in such a society.
Several seemingly insurmountable ob-
stacles delay fulfillment of this ideal:
I. Subordinates of a registered engi-
neer are not required to register. In an
office of several hundred engineers, it
could be possible to comply with the law
by having only the chief engineer regis-
tered.
2. Officers and employees of the U. S.,
while performing government service, are
not required to register. This rule actually
exempts many thousands of engineers
fully qualified for registration.
3. Registered engineers cannot be com-
pelled to join any particular national pro-
fessional engineering organization. Many
already hold membership in one or sev-
eral of the "Founder" Societies, or in
other strong technical organizations. It is
doubtful whether a really high percentage
could be induced to join a single addi-
tional organization.
Actually only 50 per cent of those
qualified for registration are now register-
ed and only 20 per cent of those regis-
tered now belong to NSPE.
The regulation of trades and profes-
sions is reserved under the Constitution
for the states themselves. The states apply
this authority through so-called "police
power."
States are restricted under the Constitu-
tion from passing laws which deprive a
person of life, liberty, property or even
the pursuit of happiness, without due
process of law. We notice the reference
is always to "pursuit" of happiness. If the
law could only guarantee this mythical
state of happiness instead of its pursuit!
An engineer can take pleasure in his
work and, comparatively speaking, he is
happy, but an engineer cannot rest satis-
fied with things as they arc\ "Not to go
forward is to go backward." As General
Electric says, "Better things, for more
people at lower prices," must always re-
main the engineer's unsatisfied goal.
It is not like the dissatisfaction between
father and son when the dad said:
"Why is it you are always wishing for
something you haven't got?"
"Well, dad," said the son, "what else
is there to wish for?"
A state is permitted to enact laws per-
taining to public welfare, public health
and public safety. The enforcement of
such laws falls under the "police power"
of the state. Engineering registration is en-
forceable only under such powers. Under
"police powers" a state can force an in-
dividual to observe any law protecting
the public health or safety. The privileges
of an individual end where they begin
to violate public welfare.
Courts have agreed that the design of
buildings, water systems, sewage disposal
plants, electrical systems, heating plants,
etc., involve public health and safety and
justify the requirement of registration for
those responsible for such design.
'Police power" also helps boards col-
lect renewal fees. An engineer's current
ability is not measured by whether or
not he has paid his current fees, but fees
are necessary to maintain an examining
board in operation and under "police
powers" a man can be prevented from
practicing unless he has paid his dues.
Since only engineers are competent to
judge engineering ability, the courts here
approved the issuing of certificates of
registration by an examining board set up
by the state itself and composed entirely
of engineers.
Most registration laws protect the public
against a deceptive use of the term
"engineer" and also against any unau-
thorized "practice of engineering." How-
ever, there are glaring exceptions to such
laws. Several states place no restriction
on the use of the title "engineer" so long
as no engineering practice is involved
and contrariwise the State of California
permits unlimited practice of engineering
(in all branches but civil and structural)
so long as the individual does not call
himself an "engineer"—uniformity still
has far to go.
Several state supreme courts have ren-
dered decisions declaring portions of
various state engineering laws unconstitu-
tional, but no state supreme court has ever
declared the principal of engineering reg-
istration unconstitutional. Any law de-
pending on "police powers" for existence
is subject to numerous constitutional chal-
lenges. Propably not one of our forty-
eight states has an engineering registra-
tion law that would not be declared un-
constitutional, in part, by at least one of
our various state supreme courts.

EXCESS HYDROCHLORIC ACID is put to work in this catalyst plant of the
Morton Salt Company at Weeks Island, Louisiana. The acid is used in a
process developed by a Standard Oil scientist to produce a top-quality catalyst.
What the scientist saw in the sandpile!
This story starts with a child's sandpile and a
scientist's curiosity. It ends eight years later
with a new top-quality catalyst—the result of
a scientist's ingenuity.
One day a Standard Oil chemist took home
some granular blast furnace slag from a neigh-
boring steel mill for his children's sandpile.
Suspecting that it had properties of potential
value, he took a pailful back to his quarters
in the Whiting Laboratory the next day.
Treating the slag with hydrochloric acid and
then drying it in an oven produced 30 cc's of
powder that proved to be an effective and
active catalyst. However, commercial produc-
tion of the catalyst was uneconomic because
of the market price of hydrochloric acid. To
overcome this obstacle, Standard Oil contacted
the Bay Chemical Company, a salt cake pro-
ducer which, at times, had difficulty marketing
hydrochloric acid—a co-product of salt cake.
The Bay Company, of Weeks Island, Louisi-
ana, now merged with Morton Salt Company,
became interested in the new catalyst and
built a plant with the aid of Standard Oil sci-
entists. The output of this plant is a top-
quality catalyst with unlimited new sources
of raw materials.
This is only one example of what Standard
Oil scientists accomplish in an atmosphere of
independent research. In our constantly ex-
panding laboratories, our scientists are free to
investigate and pursue ideas, for Standard Oil
knows that one of a scientist's greatest assets
is his curiosity.

Any law is what the United States Su-
preme Court says it is. Since there is little
likelihood of an engineering registration
law being challenged through to the
United States Supreme Court, each state-
registration law becomes what the su-
preme court of that state says it is. This
fact makes each state an entity in itself and
makes uniformity between states practical-
ly impossible. This conflict is also a defi-
nite restriction to national reciprocity. One
court will say you may not designate-
branches of engineering unless the legis-
lature defines each branch in the law it-
self. Other state courts approve branches
without legislative definition. Most courts
will permit Engineers council for profes-
sional Development accrediting but the
Colorado Supreme Court declares it an
illegal delegation of authority.
With general regard to engineering
registration a voice from the wilderness
has always cried out for "National Regis-
tration.'' Since registration is administered
under local "police powers" and since
"police powers" are state reserved and
differ in each individual state there can
be no "National Registration Law."
We do have a National Certificate is-
sued by the National Council of State-
Boards of Engineering Examiners, for a
fee of thirty-five dollars. Since the Na-
tional Council is advisory only and has no
actual power within the confines of any
state, this certificate becomes a verified
account of an engineer's education and
experience as confirmed by colleges and
at least five registered engineers. The
verification is secured by the National
Secretary of the Council and no applica-
tion is accepted unless the engineer is
first registered in his home state.
If a registered engineer expects to cross
multiple state lines, this service avoids
duplication of effort and the embarrass-
ment of requesting references to send in
the same endorsement over and over
again. Photostatic copies of confidential
reference replies and of educational rec-
ords will be sent directly to any state ex-
amining board for an additional sum of
five dollars.
The excellent reception given this Na-
tional Certificate is attested by the fact
that 85 per cent of all state boards give
at least partial acceptance to such a certifi-
cate. Since the requirements for a Na-
tional Certificate are higher than those in
the Model Law, some states grant full
registration to anyone holding a National
Certificate.
As amongst states, there can be a
concentrated national effort to obtain uni-
formity. The necessity for such uniform-
ity was recognized by the civil engineers
as far back as 1911, when only three states
had engineering laws. The civils prepared
the first Model Law as a necessary evil
with the thought that since the movement
was started and other states might adopt
engineering registration laws, such laws
should be uniform. Strangely enough,
the majority of the civils were still against
registration and their Society wasn't per-
mitted to recommend adoption of its own
Model Law.
There has never been a time since 1911
that national engineering organizations
have not had committees working on a
Model Law. New and often conflicting
Model Laws were developed at various
intervals and with various degrees of
apathy from a profesion not yet solidly
behind the engineering registration.
Many older established individual
engineers resented it as regimentation and
many chemical engineers, electrical engi-
neers, and particularly mining engineers
looked upon registration as unnecessary,
expensive and restrictive. Only the civil
engineers, with their structural steel and
reinforced concrete design work in con-
nection with buildings, began to fully re-
alize the importance and necessity of pro-
tecting the public by keeping out the in-
competent through engineeering regis-
tration laws.
It was not until 1914, when the archi-
tects of Illinois financed legal action
against the Illinois engineers thereby ob-
taining a state supreme court decision de-
claring the existing state engineering law
unconstitutional, that all engineers com-
bined into one fighting unit. The fact that
most of the sections of the Illinois law
declared unconstitutional had been copied
verbatim from the Model Law gave rise
to the fear that the entire engineers' reg-
istration movement might be threatened.
With such a threat past, differences and
petty quibblings between engineers were
forgotten.
The twelve leading engineering organi-
zations in the United States, with no ex-
ceptions, combined on preparing and ap-
proving a new Model Law. This law
adopted in 1946 was the basis for a new
law enacted by the Illinois State Legisla-
ture, which to date has not been chal-
lenged. Thus in 1946, under a threat
against the very future existence of engi-
neering registration, for the historic first
time, every major engineering organiza-
tion in the United States approved a
single Model Law.
Is it going to take some similar drastic
threat to bring all engineers together into
a Unity Organization?
The most progressive and the most ap-
preciated improvement to the Model Law
was the 1937 adoption of an 'eminence"
clause. This clause permitted boards to
grant registration without written exam-
ination to engineers over 35 years of
age, having twelve years of satisfactory
experience.
The Engineer-in-Training provision
was added in 1943 to protect and sustain
young engineers. EIT established engi-
neering graduates or others, with equiva-
lent study in the School of Hard Knocks,
as professionals in training. In many in-
stances under the old Wagner Labor Act,
the EIT certificate gave them professional
status and permitted them to avoid being
forced into a labor union against their
will.
EIT permits the young engineering
graduate to take a written examination on
theory while it is still fresh in his mind.
Even if a refresher course at this early
state is necessary, it is usually of little-
hardship.
EIT is a stimulant to keep the young
engineer professional-minded until he ac-
quires the four years of necessary experi-
ence—he remains conscious of his attach-
ment to his profession.
Registration is a mark of competence
and should be the goal of every young
engineer with EIT his first step.
Even though young engineering stu-
dents expect to enter a field other than
the practice of engineering, they seldom
really know what awaits them. Taking
and passing the EIT examination would
seem good advice for anyone who has
invested four years in an engineering edu-
cation.
EIT was instigated in 1943 and more
than half the states now give EIT examin-
ations. These states represent 85 per cent
of the engineering population. The re-
maining states will surely follow. Not all
states recognize EIT examinations given
in other states. The effort now under
way to obtain complete interstate recogni-
tion of EIT examinations will not cease
until it becomes unanimous.

While the door is still left open for
prospective young engineers to take the
EIT examination with four years of ex-
perience and home study, instead of four
years in an engineering college, the door
is slowly closing. The gap between these
two methods of becoming a registered
engineer widens every year.
In October, 1953, at the annual meet-
ing of the National Council of State
Boards of Engineering Examiners, the
president openly advocated the following
action: "I believe that we have obtained
sufficient age now to require that no per-
son can qualify for registration as a Pro-
fesional Engineer unless that person has
graduated from an accredited engineering
curriculum."
Of course, no act of the National Coun-
cil can bind any state and it will take
many, many years before all forty-eight
states will pass such a restrictive law,
but—the die is cast and eventually all or
most states will have such a law.
Before engineering registration every
plumber was a '"sanitary" engineer, every
contractor was a "structural" engineer and
every real estate man was an "appraisal"
engineer.
It took forty years from the 1907
Wyoming law until the adjoining State
of Montana made it unanimous in 1947.
Up until 1935, these were difficult and
tortuous years. Less than a third of the
states had engineering registration laws
and many engineers thought the whole
thing was on its way out. However, there
were champions of registration who would
not be denied. Their deep convictions,
their personal sacrifices and their excep-
tional abilities won over,, and from 1935
on the movement became an avalanche
which rolled relentlessly until the last
state adopted such a law.
Every new law produced a crop of
"grandfathers." The Constitution of the
United States prevents any law from de-
priving any man of the privilege of con-
tinuing any legal method through which
he made his living—so during the first
year all new laws grant "grandfather"
registration to any man who takes an oath
that, in the past, he made his living
through the practice of engineering. The
element of time is slowly eliminating any
inequities thus created. The average
"grandfather" still practicing has now
been doing so for twenty years since he
was registered and most of them would
qualify today through "eminence."
Before 1890, most engineers acquired
their education from an older man or by
self-instruction. There just weren't
enough text books on engineering sub-
jects around with which to organize a
full college engineering curriculum.
Then came good text books, top-grade
professors and excellent research labora-
tores. In recent years, companies like
G.E., Westinghouse, A.T.&amp;T., airplane
manufacturers, etc., can hire large num-
bers of well-educated engineer graduates,
all set for development work, intensified
training, research laboratories or what
have you. Phenomenal progress has fol-
lowed. The great number of educated
and prepared young engineers and young
scientists available to industries today
constitutes one reason why we have wit-
nesed such miraculous progress.
So with our advanced text books, pro-
fessors, research, laboratories and approx-
imately 400,000 educated engineers, we
are climbing up the professional ladder
and we seek full professional recognition.
Wyoming got the first engineering reg-
istration law back in the days when the
United States Government would bet a
homesteader 160 acres of land that he
couldn't live on it for three years. With-
out money for engineering service, many
homesteaders would record their water
filings by tying their diversion point into
a section corner, using only the top of a
desk and then signing their own names
as engineers. Another state legislature
passed an engineering registration law
the next session after a rabbit had dug
a hole through a self-designated engi-
neer's concrete foundation.
Registration condensed into one brief
sentence means 'keeping out the unfit."
Registration is a screen which should pass
freely those who are competent and
which should screen out all those who
are incompetent.
No profession can gain high respect
unless the minimum standard is high and
registration provides the only path to
this goal.
Excessively high standards would be-
come undesirable, less engineering be-
come an exclusive club for the "emi-
nent." Then engineering registration
would become "class legislation" and any
protective law would become unconsti-
tutional. No registration should carry
past the point where it permits the com-
petent to work and prevents the incompe-
tent from deceiving. Some advantages of
registration to engineers are:
1. The Taft-Hartley law says profes-
sional men need not join a collective bar-
gaining group in which they form a mi-
nority.
2. Some states (and others will follow)
list engineering registration as a require-
ment for some promotions.
3. In many states, engineering plans
will not be accepted for official filing un-
less the engineer is registered.
4. Engineering fees need not be paid
by an owner unless the engineer is regis-
tered. Registration is a legal requirement
and an engineering contract has no legal
standing unless the engineer is registered.
When controversies arise, such engineers
can and have lost their entire fee.
5. In most civil courts an engineer
cannot qualify as an "expert" unless he is
registered.
6. If a registered engineer makes a mis-
take resulting in loss of life or property—
it becomes a mistake of professional judg-
ment; if not licensed the man is guilty of
a criminal act. Registration will reduce or
eliminate such "mistakes."
Recent results of engineer examinations
from one state show:
74% from accredited colleges passed.
47% from non-accredited colleges
passed.
Only 20% without college education
passed.
From these results it is posible to give
a young man who wants to be an engineer
two well-selected pieces of advice:
1. Go to an engineering college
2. Select a college accredited by ECPD
People love to adopt the sobriquet
"engineer." We still have drug store
clerks using "Master Soda Fountain Engi-
neers," janitors using "School Mainten-
ance Engineers," and we even have "The
American Society of Exterminating Engi-
neers."
But the term "Professional Engineer"
belongs to us. Let's revere it, let's respect
it, let's emulate it and let's defend it.
Registration is the only way to eliminate
the unfit. Let's work to advance the sig-
nificance of the terms "Professional Engi-
neer" and "Registration" to where even
those who are not legally required will
want to register through professional
pride. Then let us reach for the goal of
the dreamer where everyone qualified for
registration will register.
Then the mark of a Professional Engi-
neer-will simply be "Registration."—End.

COMMAND PERFORMANCE . . .
This servo-motor is smaller than a household fuse—
weighs only about one and one-half ounces. Yet, with-
out such powerful compact devices, modern industry
could not function efficiently.
Servo-motors are the slaves that carry out the
commands of servo-mechanisms . . . the workhorse
and watchdog combination of today's automatic con-
trol systems. In industry they provide the precision
needed for machining propellers . . . the uniformity
necessary in the processing of food, chemicals and
petroleum . . . the phenomenal speed and efficiency
required in electronic computing systems . . . and
the control requirements of hundreds of industrial
and military applications.
MIND-MADE MIRACLE . . .
How many men worked out this miracle of precise
control of power and movement? Physicists and en-
gineers supplied theories... technicians and designers
developed them . . . chemists, metallurgists, machin-
ists . . . these and scores of others worked their
splendid best. But how did they know how? Not just
from what they learned in school ... or from their
immediate associates. For, while these helped, this
whole business of automatic control is growing so
fast and changing so rapidly that basic terminology
and concepts have not yet been settled.
So these men of science and industry look to
America's all-seeing, all-hearing and reporting Inter-
Communications System for news of the needs and of
the new in their field.
THE AMERICAN INTER-COM SYSTEM . . .

1954—Boeing 8-jot B-52, America's outstanding heavy jet bomber
Leadership is a long-time tradition at Boeing
In 1931, Boeing engineers designed the
B-9, a revolutionary low-wing bomber
that could outdistance any contempo-
rary pursuit plane.
Today, they've produced the free
world's outstanding heavy jet bomber,
the B-52, and America's first jet trans-
port. Boeing also builds the record-
breaking B-47 medium jet bomber,
conducts a major guided missile pro-
gram, and research in nuclear power
for aircraft.
These growing programs mean ex-
panding opportunities at Boeing for
engineers of virtually EVERY type,
including mechanical, civil, electrical
and aeronautical. It also means plenty
of room for advancement. Boeing,
which now employs more engineers

The hotter...the better
Carbon has a peculiar quality—it's at its best when "the heat is on"
In the roaring heat of steelmakers' furnaces, molten
metals boil and bubble like water in a teakettle.
STANDING FIRM in the intense heat of many of these
furnaces are inner walls made of blocks of carbon.
Because pure carbon laughs at heat—actually grows
stronger as it gets hotter—it has become vitally im-
portant in making iron, steel, and many of the other
things all of us use every day.
IN CHEMISTRY, carbon and its refined cousin, graphite,
handle hot and violent chemicals that would quickly
destroy metal or other materials. Today there are
pumps, pipes, tank linings, even entire chemical-process-
ing structures—all made of carbon or graphite.
UCC... AND CARBON—For over 60 years the people
of Union. Carbide have pioneered in the discovery, de-
velopment, and production of many carbon and graph-
ite products for both industry and the home. This is
one more way in which UCC transforms the elements

COST LESS BECAUSE:
1Steel is 3 times stronger than
gray iron.
2 Steel is %Vi times as rigid.
3Steel costs a third as much per
pound as cast iron.
CUTS COSTS
WITH WELDED STEEL
PRODUCTION costs largely de-
termine whether a design is ac-
ceptable for manufacture. The suc-
cessful designer therefore, seeks out
every opportunity to eliminate un-
necessary expense from his engi-
neering recommendations.
Because steel is stronger, more
rigid than iron, yet costs a third as
much per pound, costs on many
products such as the two shown be-
low can be cut as much as 50%.
COSTS 30% LESS—Machine bracket is
welded from 10 gauge metal. Weighs half
of original cast design. Cut is stronger,
more rigid. Costs 30% less to produce.
COSTS 45% LESS —Feeder roll is built
from standard channel welded to steel
discs. Steel design eliminates breakage,
weighs half of former casting. Saves 45%
on cost of manufacture.
Ideas for designing in welded steel
Bulletins and handbooks on latest design pro-
cedures are available to engineering students.

Engineers Pioneer VTO
Power Plant Development
GEORGE D. KEMP, who received his B.S. in Mechanical Engineer-
ing from Colorado A. and M. last June, is shown recording data
on the engineering log sheet from the industrial TV screen in the VTO test
cell. George—now in the Test Operations group In the Experimental Test
Section at Allison—Is working on the T40 turbo-prop engine which powers
the Convair XFY-1 and the Lockheed XFV-1 vertical take-off aircraft.
• Early in "51, Allison undertook the power plant de-
velopment for vertical take-off airplanes following the
Navy's request for a high-power, low-weight turbine
engine which could be adapted to vertical operation.
With modifications, the Allison T40 turbo-prop
engine—with its extremely high power-to-weight-ratio
—was selected to do the job. The vertical operation
necessitated basic design changes, such as changing
the oil system so it would function in both vertical and
horizontal positions. Too, it was necessary to modify
the reduction gear, giving a higher propeller RPM
and increased thrust. And, with the specially designed
propellers required by the VTOs, the control system
was redesigned.
Then, to test the engine, a radically new test stand
was designed and built. Allison engineers converted
a test stand previously used for low horsepower re-
ciprocating engines to one (shown above) capable of
accommodating VTO engines in the various positions
from horizontal to vertical. With the huge 72,000 pound
tunnel completely enclosing the engine and propeller,
a television was installed in the control room so engine
operation could be observed in any tunnel position.
The VTO power plant project is typical of the
variety of challenging problems handled by the Alli-
son Engineering staff. And, because it is continually
pioneering in advanced engineering developments,
Allison needs additional technically trained men, espe-
cially young graduate engineers. Why not plan now
for your engineering career at Allison. Write for in-
formation:

Insular Affairs Committee also stated that
Alaska's ability to finance necessary or
desirable public services is well within
its economic ability. Resources and pro-
duction are the foundations of the tax
structure, and Alaska has both great nat-
ural resources and a high per capita rate
of production." 10 Alaska's ability to ac-
cept the responsibilities of statehood is
shown by its: (1) Financial status, (2)
Experience in self-government, and (3)
Wealth of natural resources.
Financial Status. "The rate of expendi-
tures for territorial purposes as provided
for by the 1949 legislature is approxi-
mately $9,200,000 per year. This figure
covers certain deficiency and nonrecurring
expenditures. The current rate of collec-
tion is approximately $10,000,000 per
year." 11 Another example of the sound-
ness of Alaska's finances is that it has no
indebtedness, and on March 31, 1953,
had a surplus of $4,000,000.12
Experience in Self-Government. Some
critics of Alaskan statehood point out
that Alaska has an antiquated colonial
system of government which hinders its
progress. It is true that federal regula-
tions and restrictions hamper the legisla-
ture but Alaska supports all services ex-
cept those reserved to the federal gov-
ernment. The territorial government has
built up departments or boards of health,
education, welfare, agriculture, labor, tax-
ation, aviation, development, communi-
cations, highways, and highway patrol,
and has also established offices of the at-
torney general, treasurer, and auditor."
Also the Alaskan legislature was the first
to establish the 8 hour work day and it
gave Alaskan women the right to vote six
years before the 19th amendment was
ratified in the United States.1'
Wealth of Natural Resources. "Alaska's
gold, furs, and fish are well publicized,
but more valuable resources are iron ore,
coal, copper, lead, zinc, and even tin.
Other minerals are antimony, mercury,
and chromite. Alaska also has coal re-
serves that are officially described as
tremendous'." Also the great forests of
southeastern Alaska provide a mammoth,
new source of pulpwood as Canadian
supplies are depleted.15 Under the present
statehood bill the federal government
would give Alaska 23,000,000 acres of
land of her own choosing, and many
government controls would be shifted to
the Alaskan legislature, thus expanding
the Alaskan economy.16
(Continued from page 18)
ADVANTAGES OF STATEHOOD TO
ALASKANS
The advantages of statehood to the
Alaskans more than offset the increased
cost of government. Three of the major
advantages are: (1) Expansion and eco-
nomic development, (2) Power to enact
vital legislation, and (3) Representation
in Congress.
Expansion and Economic Development
Until recently, virtually all of the de-
velopment in Alaska was carried on by
absentee capital, which did the territory
almost as much harm as benefit.17 Alaska
needs permanent residents and businesses.
As a state Alaska would be able to pro-
vide more favorable conditions and in-
ducements for attracting permanent in-
dustries and residents.
Power to Enact Vital Legislation
If admitted to the Union, Alaska would
be able to take steps against transporta-
tion monopolies and could regulate the
fisheries which are now under the juris-
diction of the Department of the Interior.
Also it would be able to keep its constitu-
tion current—something that Congress
has neglected to do.18
Representation in Congress
As it is now Alaska sends one dele-
gate to the House of Representatives. He
can propose legislation but cannot vote.
With statehood, Alaska would be repre-
sented in Washington by two senators
and one representative. Also the people
would be permitted to vote in the con-
gressional and presidential elections
which they cannot do now.
PROPONENTS OF ALASKAN
STATEHOOD
Statehood for Alaska has a great deal
of popular support in the United States.
The most important proponent of the
measure is President Eisenhower. Groups
in favor of the proposal are U. S. Cham-
ber of Commerce, Jr. Chamber of Com-
merce, American Legion, Veterans of
Foreign Wars, Amvets, A. F. of L.,
C. I. O., and General Federation of
Women's Clubs. In addition, the majority
of newspapers and religious denomina-
tions are in favor of granting statehood
to Alaska.19
CONCLUSION AND RECOMMEN-
DATION
The arguments against Alaskan state-
hood are practically the same as those
arguments used against the other states
that were territories before admission to
the Union. Actually the United States
has an obligation to admit Alaska to the
Union. Besides demonstrating to the
world the United States' faith in the fed-
eration system of government, the admis-
sion of Alaska would compensate the ter-
ritory for Congress's failure to enact leg-
islation beneficial to Alaskan develop-
ment. The facts concerning Alaskan state-
hood tend to conclude that approval of
this measure would be of benefit to the
United States and to Alaska. The recom-
mendation of this report is that the Ter-
ritory of Alaska should be given imme-
diate statehood.

This is a Torrington Needle Bearing
Designed for Today's Needs and Tomorrow's Trends-
Needle Bearings Offer A Unique Combination of Advantages
The Torrington Needle Bearing has
two component parts—the full com-
plement of relatively small diameter,
thru-hardened, precision-ground
rollers and a case hardened retain-
ing shell by which they are held.
The bearing is a complete unit in
itself, and is easily pressed into posi-
tion in a bore machined to proper
dimensions. The advantages of this
unit construction in simplifying in-
stallation and speeding assembly
are readily apparent.
High Radial Capacity
Of special importance is the high
capacity of the Torrington Needle
Bearing. This efficient anti-friction
unit can carry a greater radial load
than any other bearing of compar-
able outside diameter due to the
large number of rollers. The small
cross section of the bearing allows a
large shaft which permits a rigid de-
sign with minimum shaft deflection.
Efficient Lubrication
The method of lubrication is an-
other feature of the Torrington
Needle Bearing. The retaining shell
with its turned-in lips provides a
natural reservoir for the lubricant.
Thus the needle rollers turn in an
oil or grease bath and continually
bring up a fresh film of lubricant—
insuring rotation of all moving
members on a fluid him.
Low Cost
The size of the Torrington Needle
Bearing, coupled with the simplicity
of its construction, makes it a com-
paratively inexpensive anti-friction
unit. Its compact size encourages
simplified design which requires less
material in surrounding compon-
ents. This also contributes to further
cost reductions.
The shaft serves as the inner race
in the majority of Needle Bearing
applications and therefore should
be hardened and ground to proper
dimensions. However, where it is de-
sirable to use an unhardened shaft,
an inner race can be supplied.
For Modem Design
Where the efficiency of anti-friction
operation is desired, and where
space, weight and cost are vitally
important considerations, Needle
Bearings provide a logical answer.
That's why you will find them
used in an ever-growing list of
applications.
This is one of a series of adver-
tisements designed to give you the
latest engineering information on
Needle Bearings. Should you have
occasion to work with bearing de-
sign or wish more information, write

N.Y., research laboratory.
In presenting the calculator for its first
public demonstration, W. W. McDowell,
vice-president in charge of research and
engineering, pointed out that it is an
experimental machine. "This is merely
one of the many experimental projects on
which our engineers are working and it
is one more step toward the computers
and data processing machines of the fu-
ture," Mr. McDowell explained.
The new machine is comparable in ca-
pacity to IBM's type 604 electronic calcu-
lator, of which over 2,000 are in use, it
was said. The 604 uses 1,250 vacuum
tubes. While their speeds are similar,
shown side by side the two machines
provided a sharp contrast in size. This
experimental engineering model is be-
lieved to be the first fully-operative tran-
sistorized computer complete with auto-
matic input and output.
More than 2,200 transistors are used
in the machine. A number of these are
of a design developed by the company's
own engineers to meet the operating char-
acteristics required in computer circuits.
In addition to reducing the size of the
machine, transistors affect a 95% reduc-
tion in the power requirements of the
electronic unit, eliminating the need for
a bulky power supply and forced air cool-
ing of components.
Because transistors have a much longer
life than vacuum tubes, IBM expects that
the necessary maintenance of machines
employing them will be significantly re-
duced from that of vacuum tube machines
of today.
Printed wiring, replacing much of the
wiring normally comprising a computer's
nervous system, was incorporated into the
design of the new calculator to simplify
production and maintenance, and greatly
reduce space requirements. The model
contains 595 printed wiring panels, on
which the transistors are mounted. Each
panel is about two-thirds the size of an
IBM card.

Another important phase of the com-
pany's electronic research program, as
shown to the press, deals with magnetic
core storage devices. They make up the
major "memory" component in IBM's
new "705" data processing machine, an-
nounced earlier this week. Magnetic cores
are tiny, doughnut-shaped objects that
can "remember" information indefinitely,
and recall it in a few millionths of a
second. In this research, IBM has carried
on work that originated at Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.
According to Ralph L. Palmer, director
of IBM engineering, the extensive use
now being made of magnetic cores in
equipment of this kind marks a transition
from the use of electronic tubes to semi-
conductors and solid state material. Mr.
Palmer added that the new research lab-
oratory, where members of the press saw
the demonstrations, was designed to make
it as easy as possible for engineers to see
their theories through vital testing opera-
tions to their practical applications to to-
morrows business machines.
Also demonstrated—in the com-
pany's type 101 electronic statistical ma-
chine—was the first practical use ever
made in a business machine of a gas tube
counter, an unusual device perfected by
IBM engineers. This tube gives reliable
performance where the counting speeds
required are faster than those possible
with electro-mechanical devices, yet not
so fast that expensive vacuum tube count-
ers are needed. It operates on the prin-
ciple of allowing a special type of gas
to glow within separate sections of the
tube to designate digits. Several of the
electronic statistical machines equipped
with this counter are currently undergo-
ing field tests.
Dr. James Rhyne Killian, Jr., president
of the Massachusetts Institute of Tech-
nology, will deliver the dedication ad-
dress at the formal opening of the labo-
ratory. Thomas J. Watson, chairman of
the IBM board, will place the corner-
stone.
The new laboratory represents the frui-
tion of years of study of IBM's research
and engineering requirements in terms
of structural design and interior facilities.
Hundreds of laboratories were studied
in industries and institutions, and many
scientists and engineers were consulted
before deciding upon the final plans. The
resulting building and equipment, IBM
believes, provide the ultimate in research
facilities. The new building lends itself
to rapid interior adjustments to meet the
requirements of fast moving research de-
velopments. The plan also readily allows
the addition of supplemental facilities,
both buildings and equipment as needed.
The "U" shaped structure, situated in
rolling hill country two miles from IBM's
Poughkeepsie manufacturing plant, adds
179,000 square feet to existing laboratory
floor space.
Nearly 600 of IBM's more than 1,700
engineers and researchers will work in
the building, most of which is already in
use. The two wings of the structure con-
tain 155 laboratories and offices. Labora-
tories in the south wing are used for basic
research projects. In the north wing—
. where engineers apply the results of basic
research—facilities are given over to com-
ponent development and testing.
The interior of the building is of a
"module" design which allows maximum
flexibility in the rearrangement of labora-
tory space. These modules are seven-foot
units of space, each having its own win-
dow, artificial lighting, heating, ventila-
tion, air-conditioning and laboratory ser-
vices as required. Movable steel wall
panels can be dismantled and reset at any-
desirable interval by a single workman.
The object of the design is to house in
a compact area each engineering project,
including its offices and laboratory space,
and to permit, with economy and a mini-
mum loss of time, expansion and con-
traction as the project may require.
The connecting wing of the labora-
tory houses an auditorium, reference li-
brary, lounge, shop, cafeteria, kitchen
and receiving department.
Facilities for technical meetings and
demonstrations are provided in the audi-
torium, which has a capacity of 235 per-
sons. The acoustic design of the audi-
torium is such that voices at conversation
level can be heard without echo in all
parts of the room. This is accomplished
by means of a ceiling with a unique un-
dulating profile. Equipment to be studied
and discussed during scientific programs

in the auditorium can be raised from the
basement to the stage by means of a
hydraulic elevator.
The main entrance to the laboratory is
through a lobby where the company's
products will be displayed. The connect-
ing corridor between the wings, in addi-
tion to giving access to the auditorium,
library, shop, lounge and cafeteria, will
be used as a gallery for the display of
engineering models, works of art and
other exhibits.
The building is of steel, reinforced
concrete and brick construction. It has its
own boiler plant, sewage disposal system,
water storage tank and refrigerator plant
for air-conditioning. It is completely air-
conditioned to provide comfortable work-
ing conditions despite varying laboratory
requirements. Certain areas are humidity-
controlled.
The site of the laboratory is developed
with attractive landscaping and adequate
parking for employees and visitors.
The building was erected by the Turner
Construction Company of New York.
Architects and engineers were Voorhees,
Walker, Foley and Smith, also of New
York.
In addition to its laboratory facilities
at Pouhkeepsie, IBM maintains labora-
tories at Endicott, N.Y., New York City,
and San Jose, California.
UM Joins Industry In
Industrial Program
The union of industry and the Uni-
versity of Michigan's College of Engi-
neering is anticipated under the terms of
a broad program being launched this
month by the University.
Known as the Industrial Program, the
plan is designed to open direct channels
of communication between the College
and industry, and to bring about greater
understanding and cooperation between
the two.
Under the program, subscribing indus-
tries will receive information on the Col-
lege's latest engineering and scientific
advances at nominal cost, and University
and industrial experts will meet periodi-
cally to review their mutual fields of in-
terest.
Small industries will be supplied data
they are unable to develop themselves,
and large firms will be kept informed of
work in regions in which they are espe-
cially interested or have not had time to
explore fully. Dean George G. Brown of
(Continued from page 38)
the College observed.
The subscription fee will be $5,000 a
year—about one-fourth the cost of one
technical man per year in an industrial
research laboratory. Participants will en-
roll for a three-year period.
Dean Brown pointed out that the Uni-
versity will benefit greatly from an en-
richment of its educational program. He
said he expects that industrial representa-
tives, after becoming better acquainted
with U-M research resources, will consult
more with faculty specialists and invite
them to conduct additional research in
their particular fields.
The faculty and students will gain
from increased contact with industrial
projects and personnel, and industry will
benefit further in the future from the pro-
motion of engineering education, Dean
Brown stated.
The program is the first of its kind to
be made available to industry on a broad
basis by a university. "We have tried to
make the subscription fee small enough
so that a large number of organizations
can participate in the program," Dean
Brown said. Subscription orders can be
considered as legitimate business ex-
penses, as well.
Money subscribed will be used to pro-
vide the services outlined and for support
of associated activities of the College, he
explained.
Dean Brown estimated that between
ten and 13 thousand pages of original
research data are produced each year by
members of the engineering staff.
Since publication of material in tech-
nical journals often lags a year or more
behind the actual work, one of the more
important features of the program will be
the advance distribution of the results to
subscribers, he said.
Summaries of current research and
development activities, and copies of
technical reports, bulletins, manuals, cir-
culars and other pertinent data will also
be sent out under the plan.
Special meetings and annual symposia
will bring industrial representatives to
campus to learn of the latest University
activity in their fields.
A pamphlet outlining the Industrial
Program is now being distributed. Dean
Brown indicated that he hopes for a bal-
anced participation on the part of all in-
dustrial categories.
Administration of the program is in
the hands of a staff headed by Harold A.
Ohlgren, professor of chemical engineer-
ing and assistant director of the Engineer-
ing Research Institute. This arrangement
assures the coordination of the activities
of the Industrial Program with those of
the Institute, which has been rendering
service to industry and government for
34 years, the dean pointed out.
Two special bulletins are scheduled for
distribution to subscribers late this fall.
One is a comprehensive survey of all in-
dustrial activity in the nuclear engineer-
ing field, information for which is being
culled from literally tons of material, Pro-
fessor Ohlgren said.
The other publication is a complete
manual of welding techniques, materials
and developments. 'It will be a hip-pocket
manual filled with all the information on
welding the engineer or welder needs,"
Professor Ohlgren indicated.
Other reports, preprints and technical
meetings will cover areas in which U-M
engineers have won national and interna-
tional recognition, Dean Brown stated.
These include the fields of high-tempera-
ture metallurgy, combustion, computer
design and application, fluid mechanics,
electronic instrumentation, acoustical
measurements, petroleum and hydro-car-
bons, and others.
Air Force Gets Super Sabre
The Air Force Tactical Air Command
received its first F-100 Super Sabres and
soon will have squadrons capable of
fighting at speeds faster than sound.
Ten minutes after accepting deliver)'
of his unit's first F-100 at North Ameri-
can Aviation's Los Angeles plant, Lt.
Colonel Maurice G. Long, 36, formerly
of Long Beach, Calif, and commander of
the 436th Day Fighter Squadron, flashed
across George AFB, 75 miles away.
"I barely retracted my landing gear
before it was time to let down at George,"
the dark-haired veteran fighter pilot de-
clared. "This faster than sound flight is
really something."
Also delivering new Super Sabres to
George AFB were Col. Jacob W. Dixon,
37, Lexington, Missouri, 479th Group
Commander, and Lt. Colonel William B.
Harris, 36, of Columbia, S.C., comman-
der of the 434th Squadron
J. S. Smithson, vice president of
manufacturing at North American, point-
ed out that the F-100 has been on or

first supersonic fighter to the Air Research
and Development Command last October.
The prototype of the Super Sabre was first
flown on May 25, 1953. Five months
later it roared across a 15 kilometer course
near Salton Sea at an average speed of
755.149 miles an hour to set a new
world's speed record.
The Air Force recently announced that
a new order of $100 million (one hun-
dred million has been placed for a second
source of production of the F-100 at
North American's Columbus, Ohio plant.
The F-100 has been in production at
Los Angeles since mid-1953 and will
continue to come off assembly lines at the
West Coast plant.
The 479th Fighter Wing at George
will be the first operational unit to be
equipped with the F-100. The new super-
sonic fighter will replace North American
F-86F Sabre Jets which won fame in
Korea by shooting down Russian-built
MIGs at a rate of 13.8 to 1. The F-100
can be modified as a fighter bomber and
the Air Force has announced it is capa-
ble of carrying an A-bomb.
An extensive flight testing program on
the F-100 has been conducted at Edwards
AFB by Air Research and Development
Command and company test pilots. The
Air Training Command, Air Proving
Command and Air Material Command
also have test flown the new fighter.
The F-100 incorporates a razor thin,
45 degree sweptwing and tail and was
especially designed for high speed flight.
The new, heat-resisting metal, titanium,
is used extensively throughout the plane.
It is powered by the powerful Pratt and
Whitney J-57 turbojet with afterburner
(Continued from page 40)
rated in the "10,000 pound thrust" class.
Maintenance crews have reported the
F-100 much easier to work on because of
quick access to radio, radar, electrical and
other accessory equipment.
Low Cost Nuclear Power Soon
Low cost power produced by means of
atomic energy will become a reality within
the next five to ten years because of
progress now being made in the develop-
ment of nuclear fuels and components for
atomic reactors, a prominent atomic en-
ergy scientist predicts.
Walter E. Kingston, general manager
of the Atomic Energy Division of Syl-
vania Electric Products, Inc., recently call-
ed upon the atomic energy industry, how-
ever, to place "far greater emphasis,"
in the immediate future, on the develop-
ment of improved performance in nu-
clear fuels and reactor materials and
components, so that "the most rapid pos-
sible progress can be made."
Despite the advances that already have
been achieved in the improvement of
fuel materials, methods of fabrication,
and assembly of fuel elements, the over-
all field of reactor materials still consti-
tutes "one of the greatest limiting factors
to the advancement of the entire power
field," Mr. Kingston said in a statement
prepared for delivery September 27 on a
panel program at a meeting of the Atomic
Industrial Forum.
At Sylvania, he stated, "we have rec-
ognized this situation for some time, and
virtually our entire atomic energy pro-
gram has been aimed at developing new
and better fuels, reactor materials, and
components, as well as cheaper and more
efficient means of separation and recover)'
of spent fuels." He added that the com-
pany has invested between $3 and S4
million of its own funds in its atomic
energy program, and is continuing to in-
crease this investment as circumstances
warrant.
Discussing the effects on Sylvania's
atomic energy program of the new Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, Mr. Kingston said
that whereas under the old law the mar-
ket for the company's atomic energy ser-
vices and products "was limited to one
customer" (the Atomic Energy Commis-
sion, "the number of our potential cus-
tomers now becomes unlimited."
He explained also that the provisions
of the new law permit the company to
lease from the AEC "the special material
which we plan to process," and that now,
"for the first time, we know for a cer-
tainty that one of the major constituents
of our product will be available to us in
our commercial operations."
In addition, Mr. Kingston stated, be-
cause the new law encourages private in-
vestment in all phases of the nuclear
power program, Sylvania's plans for the
future "can be made with a degree of
firmness never before possible." The com-
pany can invest in its atomic energy pro-
gram with "the assurance that a wide
market exists for our products and ser-
vices."
US Is Vulnerable
The United States is more than four
times as vulnerable to modern sea-launch-
ed air power than is the Soviet Union,
and Europe is even more vulnerable than
the United States.
So says J. W. Rizika, Massachusetts In-
stitute of Technology, writing in the Oc-
tober issue of "Mechanical Engineering,"
official publication of The American So-
ciety of Mechanical Engineers.
According to the author, 52.8 per cent
of the urban population of Europe lies
within a 60-mile range from the nearest
"unblockable coastal areas"—including
areas such as the Baltic and Mediterran-
ean Seas, which could not be completely
closed to seagoing craft. For Russia, on
the other hand, the figure is only 11.8
per cent; for the United States, 49.2 per
cent.
These figures are designed to gauge
the probable effectiveness of a specific
type of missile: a submarine-launched,

When an installation, once completed, should be
as trouble-proof as planning and materials can
make it — engineers rely on cast iron pipe. It
has high beam-strength, compressive-strength and
shock-strength. Its effective resistance to corrosion
ensures long life, underground or underwater.
These are reasons why cast iron pipe is so widely
used for water lines in tough terrain, pressure and
outfall sewers, river crossings, and encased piping
in sewage treatment and water nitration plants.

material with the desired heat resistant
properties.1 If such speeds are maintained
the temp, rise in materials comprising
aircraft structures will approach 7000 de-
grees Fahrenheit. There are 4 main types
of super alloys.
1. Metals and alloys
2. Metals with ceramic coatings
3. Ceramic materials
4. Combinations of ceramics and metals
The NACA is studying effects of su-
personic speeds on these materials by
rocket powered models equipped with
telemetering devices to send the required
information back to ground stations. By
this method, NACA can determine the
structural efficiency of the metals.
RESULTS OF TESTS
Molbydenum
At temperatures above 1600 degrees
Fahrenheit the creep and stress rupture-
properties of molbydenum are superior
to conventional high temp, alloys. The
chief deterrent is the lack of a method
for protecting the surface against rapid
oxidation at high temp. Molybdenum
(Continued from page 22)
melts at 4750 degrees fahrenheit and has
good structural stability at high tempera-
tures compared to other metals. To rem-
edy the oxidation problem, coatings of
molybdenum disilicide have been tried
with some success. There are indications
also that ceramic coatings will give good
protection against oxidation.
Titanium
This metal is of high strength and
light weight. It gives good service to
approx. 1000 degrees Fahrenheit. Titan-
ium forms a protective oxide coating on
its surface giving it good corrosion resis-
tance. This metal is already in use in
many supersonic aircraft.
Zirconium
This metal has strong potentialities as
an alloying element. It has excellent cor-
rosion resistance. The main drawback is
that hafnium metal is nearly always found
in zirconium minerals. Special methods
are used to purify zirconium and this is
done with considerable difficulty.
Aluminum
An aluminum alloy designated XA78s
is 10% stronger than the highest strength
aluminum alloy now in use. New wear
resistant coatings of anodic oxide are be-
ing used on turbine blades, nozzles, and
gears.
A Swiss aluminum alloy SAP shows
promise. It has a low creep rate, and in
general is superior to conventional alum-'
inum alloys.
Ceramics
In aircraft applications, ceramic coat-
ings protect parts against inter-granular
corrosion at temperatures up to 2100 de-
grees Fahrenheit. Cemented titanium car-
bide compositions show oxidation resis-
tance and good strength properties. These
qualities make them potentially useful
turbine blade materials.
CONCLUSION
There is no indication of a quick solu-
tion to this problem. However, the situa-
tion is being steadily improved. Titanium
is probably the most promising alloy but
ceramics opens an entirely open field of
potentialities. The progress in heat resis-
tant metals has been fairly slow in the
past but is being speeded up. When the
material that fills the requirements is
found it will probably not be an entirely
new metal, but a combination of present
day metals. It will be a compromise of
the good points of several materials al-
loyed together.

single-stage, ballistic rocket, such as the
A-4 (V2). The present areodynamic
maximum range of the A-4 is calculated
to be about 400 miles, with the missile
traveling at an average speed as great as
a mile a second.
Lying within the 400 mile range, Mr.
Rizika writes, is 99:5 per cent of Europe's
urban population, 70.6 per cent of this
country's and only 20.3 per cent of the
Soviet Union's.
The article is based on geographic and
demographic studies for all of the larger
cities of the Soviet Union, Europe and
the United States. It is intended "to pro-
vide the aircraft researcher and manufac-
turer with some background material"
concerning present and future military
planning.
The author concludes that the Russians
are well aware of their advantage in the
ballistic rockets field, as evidenced by
their continuation and expansion of the
German operations at Peenemunde, as
well as of their own submarine produc-
tion.
Although noting that "it seems that the
American offensive strategic weapons
should be more highly concentrated in the
longer-range guided missiles and piloted
bombers," Mr. Rizika urges that emphasis
in respect to a ballistic rocket-type weap-
on should be directed toward defensive
measures.
First Industrial Reactor
The first nuclear reactor for industrial
research will be established at Armour
Research Foundation of Illinois Institute
of Technology, Chicago, it was disclosed
by Dr. Haldon A. Leedy, Foundation di-
rector.
By offering direct benefits to industry
through a new research tool, the proposed
reactor promises to be a major advance
in the technology of the Chicago area,
Leedy said.
Plans for the reactor—or "atomic pile"
—are being submitted to the Atomic
Energy Commission for consideration of
the design, building plans, and schedule
of operation.
Chicago area industries will join the
Foundation in financing the reactor and
associated equipment, which will cost
approximately $500,000. The reactor will
be housed in a new 8,000-square foot
building on the Illinois Tech campus.
The proposed reactor, designed for
50,000 watts, is specifically a highly flex-
CContinued from page 42)
ible neutron and gamma source, and is
not intended for research on reactors
themselves or for the generation of elec-
trical power, according to Dr. Richard F.
Humphreys, manager of the physics re-
search department, who is director of the
project.
The reactor will permit investigations
into such fields as: sterilization of foods
and drugs; high polymer studies of the
structure of plastics, rubber and similar
materials; glass and ceramics; wear and
fraction studies; the development of
metals and alloys, and medical techniques
for diagnoses and therapy.
At present, there is only one reactor not
devoted to AEC work—a 10,000-watt re-
actor at North Carolina State college. At
least three more are being planned for
educational and college research, but the
Armour Research Foundation reactor is
the first directed toward industrial re-
search.
The reactor building, which will be
built in the middle of the block between
34th and 35th and Dearborn and State
streets, will take the style of other glass
and brick, Mies can der Rohe-designed
buildings on the Illinois Tech campus.
Surrounded by 2,500 square feet of
working area to accommodate experimen-
tal set-ups, the reactor will possess a max-
imum of ports and a large thermal col-
umn for convenience in irradiation and
other uses.
The reactor room will be a gas-tight
steel tank, approximately 60 feet in diam-
eter, and 25 feet high. It will be adjacent
to laboratories for handling and storing
radioactive material and for conducting
nuclear research.
The reactor wll be free of all restric-
tions not called for by technical common
sense.
"Sponsored research will be subject to
no security classification, no competiton
from military applications, no secrecy of
any kind other than that called for in the
protection of the individual sponsor's
programs," Humphreys said.
Fuel for the reactor will be obtained
from the Atomic Energy Commission on
"extended loan," as required by law. The
fuel will be granted only after careful in-
spection by the AEC.
Armour Research Foundation will as-
sume about one-third of the investment.
Industries in the Chicago area are being
invited to participate in the construction
of the facility with subscriptions of
$20,000, for which they will receive a
number of benefits.
Humphreys explained that the reactor
will make possible:
—Production of short-lived radioiso-
topes that would be impractical to procure
from distant government laboratories such
as Oak Ridge.
—Neutron activation, a new and pow-
erful technique used for the most sensi-
tive chemical analysis now known. By
this method, near studies, non-destructive
testing, and other difficult studies now
become possible.
—Neutron diffraction for use in struc-
ture analysis that exceeds standard x-ray
techniques.
—Radiation-induced effects in plastics,
glasses, organic systems, and certain me-
tallic alloys.
—Studies on the effects of radiation on
biological and chemical systems.
Army Gets New Recoilless Rifle
A lightweight recoilless rifle and new-
type ammunition with unprecedented
tank-killing power were unveiled to the
public today by the Army Ordnance Corps
in Lacarno, Ohio.
The weapon, a 106 mm battalion anti-
tank rifle known as "the BAT," has
double the penetrating power of any ex-
isting recoilless rifle. Weighing less than
500 pounds, it can be carried by three
men or mounted in a Jeep.
The rifle and ammunition were demon-
strated at a meeting of the Cleveland
ordnance post of the American Ordnance
association at the Erie Ordnance depot in
Lacarne.
Col. E. W. Grubbs, commanding of-
ficer of the depot, said the BAT is
capable of knocking out the largest and
most powerful of tanks.
The weapon was developed by Frank-
ford Arsenal of Philadelphia, with the as-
sistance of Armour Research Foundation
of Illinois Institute of Technology, Chi-
cago; the Frigidaire division of General
Motors, Dayton, Ohio; Springfield
Armory, Springfield, Mass., and Fire-
stone Tire &amp; Rubber company, Akron,
Ohio.
Development work began on the rifle
shortly after the start of the Korean
war, but production did not start until
last fall. It is now being produced by
Firestone.
One of the features of the weapon is

and development of new chemical separa-
tion processes for an Atomic Energy Com-
mission contractor at Idaho Falls, Idaho.
He held this position until he assumed
his present duties at the university in
November of 1953-
Mr. Ohlgren's interests and recent ex-
perience have been in the field of nuclear
development. One of his reasons for com-
ing to the university is that he believes
that people who have experience in the
nuclear development program must take
the initiative in bringing private indus-
try into the field, or the nuclear industry
may be retarded by governmental con-
trol and lack of economic motive for in-
dustrial interest. As he sees it govern-
ment and industry can be brought to-
gether through the medium of coopera-
tive development efforts and through or-
ganizations such as the Engineering Re-
search Institute, which serve both gov-
ernment and industry through research
contracts. The independent research or-
ganization is therefore able to assist
industrial concerns interested in the pos-
sibilities of application of nuclear power
and other products by acting in a con-
sulting capacity and as an intermediary
between industry and government.
On the personal side, Mr. Ohlgren
is actively interested in Y.M.C.A., Boy
Scouts, and Masonic affairs. His hob-
bies include woodworking, raising dogs
and horses, hunting, fishing, and skiing.
The Ohlgrens have two sons, David,
fourteen, and Thomas, twelve. Mrs. Ohl-
gren is a graduate of the University of
Minnesota where she studied psychology
and social work.

plate is depressed an electric switch is
thrown which starts the melting system.
Anti-Freeze Compounds
Thus far nothing has been said about
the use of antifreeze compounds to pre-
vent the freezing of hot water in a snow-
melting system. There are a number of
chemicals which can be added to water to
lower the solution's freezing point. How-
ever, the most popular and practical are
ethylene glycol base solutions. There are
at least two of these available commer-
cially. They have almost identical anti-
freeze properties so the choice between
the two is up to the designer.

jobs—jobs that can be handled by tech-
nical assistants. An engineer, however,
can do the job better, quicker, and at less
expense to the organization. He'll always
be worth more.
During January of this year there were
about 40,000 engineer openings. The me-
dian starting salary for graduating engi-
neers has gone from $4350 per year in
1954 to $4500 per year in 1954, due to
the supply of engineers staying short and
the demand staying high.
1954 June graduates in the top half
of their class were able to pick and
choose, with some receiving from five to
ten offers. The poorer students from this
year's class had to hunt a little but plenty
of positions were available.
As one private employment agency
summed it up: "We have practically no
June engineer graduates coming to us
for employment. It is too easy for them
to find good positions without our help."

Naval Secrets Safe
Ten years ago this month, the United
States Navy placed orders for 3,500,000
padlocks, for undisclosed use, Industrial
Distribution, recalls. The move created a
ten-month backlog in the padlock in-
dustry.
Fire Prevention
To reduce the fire hazard from waste
material accumulated in a textile mill, one
company has installed a permanent-type
magnet between the feed table and feed
apron of its waste machine, Textile World
reports. The magnet catches all ferrous
metal as the operator pushes the waste
across it to the feed apron.

pull a crawler with cobalt into the pipe to
radiograph welds. The dog was held at
one end of the pipe while her owner, for-

An Australian city has proposed the
packaging of milk in plastic containers
that can be tossed at the house like the

for the first misuse, a $5 fine for the
second, $25 for the third and $100 for
each additional infraction. Fifty inspec-

More Speeding Tickets?
Passenger cars may have a top speed of
150 miles per hour within five years, ac-
cording to American Machinist. Car mak-
ers aren't far behind the Indianapolis
Speedway records, and one of the Speed-
way cars recently hit 175 mph on a test
run.
Plastic Growth
The plastics industry, in 1953, con-
sumed an estimated 14 per cent of all
petrochemicals produced in the United
States. Plastics now are the fourth largest
outlet for petroleum-derived chemicals,
following rubber (20 per cent), automo-
tive and aviation (17 per cent), and syn-
thetic fibers (15 per cent).
Disposable Tools
The Red air force uses 'throwaway"
kits for field maintenance of its aircraft,
according to Aviation Week. Mechanics
draw parts from stock .already packaged
with a set of cheap tools which are used
just for one job and then discarded.
Over-Zealous Magnet
Drivers on the 64 miles of roads serv-
ing a chemical concern's plants in Texas
now are protected against nail-punctured
tires by a mobile magnetic broom. Al-
though efficient in removing metal haz-
ards to automobile and truck tires, the
machine must be guided around manhole
covers, since the nondiscriminating mag-
net snatches them up too.
Tubeless Truck Tires
At least one truck, planned as a pilot
model for the future, will be equipped
with tubeless tires as an experiment, ac-
cording to Fleet Owner. In the larger
sizes there still are problems to be solved,
but increased production on passenger
car tires is providing an incentive for sat-
isfactory tubeless truck tires, too.

Sun-Loving Dolls
Dolls that will sunburn may be the
next toy rage, according to Chemical

veloped a doll that will tan when exposed
to the sun and will revert to its original
color when left indoors several hours.

James B. Walker received his B.S. in mechanical engineering from
North Carolina State College in June 1954, and he's presently working
for his M.S. at the same college. By asking pertinent questions, Jim is
making sure that the position he finally accepts will be the right one for
a fellow with his training.
Jim Walker asks:
Can a mechanical
engineer make
real progress in
a chemical firm?
"Pick" Pickering answers:
H. M. Pickering, Jr., received a B.S. in M.E.
and E.E. from the Univ. of Minn, in 1940. He
gained valuable technical experience at Han-
ford Works, in Richland, Washington, and in
Du Pont's Fabrics and Finishes Plant at Parlin,
N. J. Today he is Works Engineer for Du Pont's
Seaford, Del., plant, where nylon comes from.
Well, Jim, that's what the lawyers call a leading
question, and the answer leads right into my baili-
wick. I came to Du Pont in 1940, after taking a com-
bined mechanical and electrical engineering course.
So I had what you might call a double reason for
wondering about my future with a chemical firm.
I scon learned that the success of a large-scale
chemical process is vitally dependent upon mechan-
ical equipment. And the success of this mechanical
equipment—especially for a new process—depends
on (1) Research, (2) Development, (3) Plant Engi-
neering, and (4) close Supervision. The net result is
that a mechanical engineer at Du Pont can progress

along any one of these four broad highways to a top-
level position.
My own Du Pont experience includes mechanical
engineering work in fields as varied as atomic energy,
fabrics and finishes, and nylon manufacture. Every
one of these brought with it a new set of challenging
problems in construction, instrumentation, and
power supply; and every one provided the sort of
opportunities a man gets in a pioneering industry.
So, to answer your question, Jim, a mechanical
engineer certainly has plenty of chances to get some-
where with a chemical company like Du Pont!

An instrument that can identify and
measure precisely in 15 minutes as many
as 20 substances in a chemical mixture
has been added to the research facilities
of the University of Michigan.
Called a mass spectrometer, the three-
ton, $42,000 device will enable scientists
here to tackle research problems previous-
ly beyond their reach.
The instrument will reveal the makeup
of samples that could not be analyzed
before or that were analyzed only after
weeks of painstaking work. In some cases,
the spectrometer can single out a com-
ponent present in one part per million
parts of a mixture.
The fourth spectrometer of its kind in
the nation owned by a university, it has
been installed in the spectroscopy labora-
tory of the Chemical and Metallurgical
Engineering Department of the College
of Engineering. It will be operated by
spectroscopist David M. Brown and by
others under his direction.
Vacuum and electronic systems are in-
corporated in the instrument. Samples are
changed to gas and fed into a vacuum
chamber, where the gas is bombarded by
a steam of electric current. The various
gas molecules break up in characteristic
patterns, and the fragments are acceler-
ated toward a target. Here they are iden-
tified by the tiny charges they carry and
the amount they were diverted en route
by a magnetic field.
Water-repellent Silicone
A new silicone water-repellent for ma-
sonry—capable of more effective perform-
ance on common brick than any previous
available material—has just been an-
nounced by the General Electric Com-
pany's Silicone Products Department.
Designated silicone Dri-Film* 103
water repellent, the transparent silicone
resin is said to prolong the useful life of
masonry, reduce maintenance costs, and
not only help maintain the masonry's nat-
ural beauty but allow it to "breathe" free-
ly after treatment.
General Electric engineers said Dri-
Film 103 minimizes efflorescence, greatly
retards spalling and cracking and makes
possible cleaner exterior surfaces, when
properly applied to above-ground brick,
concrete, mortar and other masonry ma-
terials. The new water-repellent may be
applied either by brush or spray; one
gallon of diluted material affords a cov-

erage of 75 to 100 square feet in one
coat, on most surfaces.
Independent laboratory test results indi-
cate that General Electric silicone treated
common brick will only absorb 0.01 per
cent moisture after being immersed in
water for a one-week period. Common
brick was treated with five per cent sili-
cone solids diluted with a commercial sol-
vent. This moisture absorption rate is
technically superior to all competitive
water repellents for common brick.
Since rain splashes and runs off sili-
cone treated surfaces—carrying away dirt
deposits—exterior surfaces are kept clean
for a longer period of time.
General Electric engineers said that
peeling and flaking of interior walls is
also minimized since the new water re-
pellent reduces the passage of moisture
through the masonry, thereby pushing
paint from the wall. They said that sili-
cones prevent water mingling with salts
inhering in brick or mortar, thus mini-
mizing or eliminating unsightly white or
yellowish salt deposit marks on outer
masonry surfaces.
Dri-Film 103 is an addition to General
Electric's current broad line of silicone
water repellents.

cessful applicant who satisfies the uni-
versity's scholastic requirements for four
years. In each case, the school picks the
winner from among the high school
seniors who apply from all parts of the
country.
The school also receives a Lockheed
grant to administer the scholarship. The
program is designed, Lockheed Vice Pres-
ident Cyril Chappellet said, to attract the
nation's youth into fields of study which
will qualify them for careers in industry-.
Mattes is a son of the late Gus Mattes

RCA Hobby Kit Teaches Youngsters
Basic Electronics
The how's and why's of basic elec-
tronics are unfolded for youngsters in a
new educational hobby kit manufactured
for "Industrial America," Inc. by the
Radio Corporation of America, it was

Youngsters can actually construct one
and two-tube radio receivers and trans-
mitters, chemical batteries, and experi-
ment with sound and electricity from ma-
terials in the kit.
The RCA electronics kit is part of the
Educational Hobby Kit program which
is being launched by "Industrial Amer-
ica," Inc., to enable boys and girls to
learn-by-doing with the thought that the
kits will help the youngsters obtain a
better understanding of science and in-

or hobbies.
The RCA-manufactured electronic kit
will go on sale in the U. S. and Canada
beginning Sept. 22. This kit and others
in the series will be marketed by "Indus-
trial America" through its own trade and
distribution channels consisting princi-
pally of department stores, toy shops, and
hobby stores.

companies in a growing well-established
industry.
The company should have a successful
record which means the management
should have proven itself over a period
of years not only to be able to manage
well, but also to be progressive, and the
company should be in good financial
shape. It should have a history of more
than average growth which frequently
means that in its own industry, its line
of products does not completely cover
the field. Therefore, the company can
grow not only as its industry grows, but
also as it adds new products progressively
to round out its line. These smaller com-
panies are apt to grow faster percentage-
wise than their very large competitors
who have been in business so long that
their line of products is virtually com-
plete. These large companies are likely
to offer a little more security, particularly
in the early years of employment, but
probably not quite the opportunities for
advancement for the average young engi-
neer.
The man who needs still more security
to remain happy and whose inclinations
(Continued from page 20)
are perhaps not very competitive, will
probably be better satisfied in one of the
largest companies in the most stable in-
dustries whose products or services find a
market both in good times and bad.
As a general rule, these very secure po-
sitions do not pay as much salary as the
more speculative ones, but there are fre-
quently other forms of compensation
such as more favorable insurance, pen-
sion or medical treatment plans, company
activities, and, above all, peace of mind
of the employee.
Now suppose that the young engi-
neer or investor has sized up the situa-
tion and has boiled his choice down to a
few companies which appear to offer
about equal prospects in the future, there
is not much more that can be done. The
final choice becomes largely a matter of
chance and is relatively unimportant as
far as the odds are concerned.
It appears, therefore, that the guides of
the investment counsellor in choosing at-
tractive common stocks for his client can
be useful to the young engineering grad-
uate confronted with a great many oppor-
tunities for employment. Both the in-
vestor and the young engineer are likely
to do well with a growing company in a
growing industry, and both will find it
imposible to predict much ahead of time
their exact rate of progress with extreme
accuracy. Both the young engineer and
the investor who are willing to take a
reasonable amount of risk will find the
odds in their favor if they choose an ag-
gressive growing company in a growing
industry that is well established in our
economic pattern.

tions, prepared under the guidance of
Encyclopedia Britannica, accompanies the
kit.
Youngsters working from the first kit
start by rubbing two pieces of paper to-
gether, thus inducing a flow of electrons.
The electrons can be discovered and
measured by the assembly of a galvano-
meter or current detector built from the
contents of the kit.
Experiments with a head set allow
youngsters to hear the electrons as they
are produced.
By inserting strips of copper and zinc
from the kit into ordinary lemon or salt
water solution, the youngster then makes
a chemical battery. He can use the battery
to power a telegraph and can listen to the
message with the earphone.
Additional experiments lead the
youngster to the stage where he assembles
and operates a simple low-powered radio
transmitter. Finally, he or she can build
the two-tube radio receiver and one-tube
transmitter.
Contents of the kit include a variable
(tuning) condenser, plate coil, antenna
coil, dial, "B" battery clip, ground clamp,
6-wire lead, soil antenna wire, screw-
driver, coil magnet wire, steel rod, zinc
strip, copper strip, compass, headphone

bracket, coil ground wire, and reversible
assembly board.
Also included are two resistor, "A"
battery clips, tube sockets, vacuum tubes;
three capacitors; and one assortment of
Fahnestock clips, screws, nuts, etc..
Future TV
General Electric scientists here envision
the TV set of 1964 with a picture screen
so thin that the complete unit could be
hung like a painting on your living room
wall. The circuitry would be built into
the picture frame and would use printed
wiring and miniaturized components.
Controls would be located in a small box
beside your easy chair.
Or for those who might prefer a table
model, the thin picture screen would be
mounted like a vanity mirror, attached to
slender arms extending upright from a
small oblong cabinet which would house
the circuitry and controls.
These futuristic models, at least 10

The POW, or "picture on the wall"
TV receiver is just a glint in the scient-
(Continued from page )0)
ists' eyes at the moment. But they are
convinced such a unit can be developed
and have designed a dummy receiver to
help visualize the future TV unit which
is pictured in the current issue of Collier's
Magazine.
As explained by Dr. Lloyd T. DeVore,
manager of the G. E. Electronics Labora-
tory, the POW vision of the future stems
from development work being done here
on new miniature electronic components,
and from a complex project underway to
speed the plotting of aircraft in military
filter centers.
At present, this aircraft plotting, es-
sential to successful interception of enemy
planes, is done manually. The planes are
followed by radar operators and informa-
tion fed to plotters who pin-point the
planes with crayon on the transparent
wall-size plotting board.
The plotting would be done automati-
cally with the POW type of board.
Dr. DeVore says the radar display sys-
tem under development will use elec-
tronic computer circuitry techniques to
convert a transmitted signal into an image
on the plotting board.
The plotting board screen will be com-
posed of a space matrix constituted by
closely spaced perpendicular wire grids
luminescing at their intersections to re-
produce the transmitted picture.
Development of speedier switching
techniques and new fast-reacting electro-
luminescent phosphors are needed before
the POW system could be applied to tele-
vision receivers, Dr. DeVore said.
Atom Submarine's Atmosphere is
Continuously Purified
When the Navy's atom-powered sub-
marine, the Nautilus, is buttoned up for
diving its crew must, of course, work in
a non-toxic atmosphere. So a carbon
dioxide removal unit, built by The Gird-
ler Company, Louisville, Ky., is among
its facilities.
The unit is designed around Girdler's
standard Girbotol process, which industry
today uses almost exclusively for the
separation of carbon dioxide from gase-
ous mixtures and related purposes.
For the Nautilus application, Girdler
technicians undertook extensive research
that led to the satisfactory solution of
difficulties formerly experienced with
amine absorbents in the presence of oxy-
gen.
When the unit is placed in operation,
the air of the submarine is passed through
an absorber column. There it meets a
countercurrent stream of the absorbing
medium, which removes the carbon diox-
ide. Then the absorbent is reactivated in a
separate vessel and recycled. Thus, excess
carbon dioxide is continuously extracted
from the atmosphere.
The carbon dioxide is released from the
reactivator, with some rejected steam, by
the application of heat in the reboiler.
Compressed, it is exhausted into the sea
where it dissolves and leaves no bubbles
to reveal the submarine's position. The
heat of compression is recovered in the
reactivator boiler before the carbon diox-
ide is expelled. The effect is to reduce ap-
preciably the outside heat load needed for
continuously reactivating the absorbing
solution.
The Girdler-built unit has a high ca-
pacity for absorption of carbon dioxide
in relation to its size and weight and
the volume of absorbent employed. It is
fabricated mainly of thin-wall stainless
steel. The small remaining portion is of
copper nickel alloy.
Another carbon dioxide removal unit is
being built by Girdler for the Navy's sec-
ond atom submarine, the Sea Wolf, now
under construction.
Climax Launches Chemical
Research Program
A research program in molybdenum
chemicals was launched this week by the
Climax Molybdenum Company with the
announcement Monday of a quarter mil-
lion dollar expansion of the company's
laboratories in Detroit.
The new chemical program according
to Alvin J. Herzig, Climax Vice-President
—Research, will be devoted mainly to re-
search in molybdenum catalysts for up-
grading low octane gasoline, in the syn-
thesis of new molybdenum chemicals and
in Moly-sulfide, the promising new lubri-
cant.
Molybdenum catalysts have recently at-
tracted considerable interest in the petro-
leum industry because of their rugged-
ness, long life, and resistance to sulfur.
Moly-sulfide has proved to have superior
qualities as a lubricant, particularly at
high and low temperature and under
extreme pressure.
To house the new research program,
Mr. Herzig announced the acquisition of

How billet mill gets extra
2|| bearing capacity in same space
Engineers who designed this 10-stand billet mill speci-
fied that the roll necks be mounted on Timkcn' Balanced
Proportion bearings. That's because Timken Balanced
Proportion bearings have load ratings up to 40%
higher than same-size bearings of older designs. And
they make possible a 50 to 60% increase in roll neck
strength which means greater rigidity and higher roll-
ing precision.
True rolling motion, high precision
practically eliminate friction
All lines drawn coincident with the working surfaces
of the rollers and races of Timken bearings meet at a
common point on the bearing axis.This meansTimken
bearings are designed to give true rolling motion. And
they are precision manufactured to live up to their
design. Result: Timken bearings practically eliminate
friction, save power.

Two New High-Speed Movie Films
Developed By Kadok
Two new high-speed movie films, de-
signed for use under extremely poor light-
ing conditions, such as those frequently
encountered by newsreel, sports, educa-
tional, and industrial photographers, have
been developed by the Eastman Kodak
Company.
They are Tri-XX Panchromatic Nega-
tive Film, which equals the quality and
speed of the newest and fastest sheet
films, and the Cine-Kodak Tri-X C P
Reversal Film. Both films must be proc-
essed by the user or a commercial labora-
tory. In many instances, photographers
will choose between the two films in ac-
cordance with processing facilities avail-
able. However, neither film will be proc-
essed by the manufacturer.
Tri-X Negative Film represents a film
manufacturing triumph over the problem
of increasing grainess in high-speed films.
While it has twice the speed of Super-XX
Negative Film, its granularity is about the
same, or slightly less.
It is expected to have wide applications
in filming newsreels, in photographing
scenes on dark days and exteriors at night,
and in picturing large interior areas under
existing light conditions when it might be
impossible to set up auxiliary lighting
units.
The Tri-X C-P Reversal Film will be
used widely in situations requiring multi-
ple prints and in which extremely rapid
processing at high temperatures is desir-
able. While not as fast as the negative-
film, it has 50 per cent greater speed than
Cine-Kodak Super-XX and is of medium
graininess.
The negative film is now on the market
and the reversal film will be available late
in September.
Tri-X Panchromatic Negative Film is
available in 16mm Safety Film and 16mm
Sound Recording Safety Film in 100- and

200-feet rolls on camera spools. The 100-
foot rolls are priced at $3.80; the 200-
foot rolls, $6.35.
Cine-Kodak Tri-X C-P Reversal Film
is available in 16mm Safety and Sound
Recording Film in 100- and 200-foot rolls
on camera spools, priced at $4.85 and
$8.25, and in a 400-foot dark-room load-
ing at $15.45.
Atom-Power Plant
Operating features of the first central-
station atomic-power plant, to be built
by Westinghouse Electric Corporation for
use by Duquesne Light Company, Pitts-
burgh, are explained by Charles H.
Weaver, manager of Westinghouse
Atomic Power Division, in the July issue
of "Mechanical Engineering", official
publication of The American Society of
Mechanical Engineers.
The basic design of the pressurized
light-water reactor was established by the
Atomic Energy Commission and includes
the following specifications:
1. Generation of 60,000 kw of useful
electric energy.
2. Central-station type turbine operated
by 600-lb. saturated steam, and conven-
tional electric-generating equipment and
accessories.
The main coolant system, which carries
heat from the reactor to four steam gen-
erators, will consist of four loops which
can be individually isolated by shut-off
valves for maintenance. Rated plant out-
put will normally be provided by three
loops, the fourth serving as a spare,
Water in these loops will circulate at a
pressure of some 2000 psi. and about 525
deg. F., thus avoiding cavitation problems.
Water will be circulated at 16,000 gallons
per minute in each loop and will require
a total of about 1000 hydraulic horse-
power for three loops.
The high pressure of the primary water
is to be maintained by a pressurized tank
which floats on the system and is connect-
ed to one of the reactor outlet pipes. The
tank will be normally filled with about
equal volumes of water and saturated
steam at more than 600 deg. F. The head
of steam will be maintained by electrical
heaters in the water. Load changes affect
volume change and the head of steam ex-
pands or contracts to accommodate this
change. Any change of temperature of the
primary coolont is corrected automatically
by increase or decrease of the power out-
put.
The reactor core will consist of more
than 20,000 lb. of uranium, containing
slightly more of the 235 isotope than nat-
ural uranium. The fuel elements will be
formed into a right circular cylinder about
6 ft. in diameter and 7.5 high. Maximum
fuel element surface temperature will be
less than 636 deg. F., which is the boiling
point of water at 2000 ps pressure. Maxi-
mum heat flux will be more than 350,000
Btu per sq. ft. per hr., and the average
power density will be about 45 kw of heat
per liter. The reactor vessel will be large
enough to take cores larger than the first
one. It will be about 9 ft. I.D. and 25 ft.
high, and made of stainless clad steel.
Steam generators will consist of two
major components: a heat-exchanger and
a steam drum. Primary coolant will flow
through the inside of stainless-steel tubes,
and steam plant feedwater will be fed
into the shell side. Steam thus generated
will rise to the steam drum where it will
be dried by passing through a conven-
tional steam separator. The four steam
generators will be built by two companies
using designs that differ considerably so
that possible differences in performance
can be studied.
Pumps will be single-stage centrifugal
units driven by induction motors of the
canned type in order to avoid mainten-
ance and leakage problems of rotating
seals. A squirrel-cage rotor is contained in
a shrink-fit jacket of Inconel and turns
within a stator also enclosed in Inconel.
The space between is filled with the fluid
that is being pumped through the reactor
circuit. The bearings, inside the stator,
are lubricated by this fluid.
The entire primary plant will be en-
closed in a steel container as an extreme
precaution to retain radioactive materials
that might escape as a result of an acci-
dent.
Portable X-ray
Preceded by three years of extensive
field testing, a new line of portable indus-
trial X-ray equipment for field, factory
and laboratory use is currently being in-
troduced and manufactured in this coun-
try by the Balteau Electric Corporation,
New and Meadow Sts., Stamford, Conn.
The new equipment, which bears the
trade name of Baltograph, features maxi-
mum penetration for minimum weight.

Mars and Venus to Space Traveller
The first space traveler to reach the
planet Mars will find it a lifeless world,
according to conclusions announced re-
cently by Dean B. McLaughlin, University
of Michigan astronomy professor. He
spoke before the American Astronomical
&lt;Continued from page 54)
Society meeting here Sunday through
Wednesday under auspices of the U-M
astronomy department.
Professor McLaughlin proposed that
the dark markings on Mars' red surface
are drifts of volcanic ash, and not vegeta-
tion as has long been conjectured.
Active Martian volcanoes, Professor
McLaughlin stated, are the most plausible-
source of material such as is required to
make the drifts. Volcanic ash should in
the dry, oxygen-poor atmosphere of Mars,
be green rather than brown as on earth.
It has long been known that the dark
areas on Mars become greener during the
planet's summer, and some earlier theories
attributed this to the growth of vegeta-
tion.
However, the Michigan astronomer
pointed out that this color change is just
what would be produced by the greater
spread of the green ash by the strong pre-
vailing winds at that season.
Mar's canals, on this picture, would be
long, narrow, ash drifts, or in some cases
volcanic rifts in the planet's crust. Ac-
cording to Professor McLaughlin, the
conditions on Mars correspond to an early
stage in the earth's development, so that
the red planet may possibly be one on
which oceans have yet to form, and on
which life is still to appear.
The planet Venus may be a world
completely covered by an ocean of water,
it was reported recently before the Ameri-
can Astronomical Society, as the four
day meeting on the University of Michi-
gan campus closed.
The proposal, by Harvard astronomer*
Donald H. Menzel and Fred L. Whipple
contradicts earlier beliefs that there is
little or no water on that planet becaus.
its spectrum does not show any bands
characteristic of the water molecule.
The Harvard astronomers point out
that the thick cloud layer surrounding
Venus has been shown (by the late-
French astronomer Bernard Lyot) to have
the optical properties of terrestrial clouds,
and hence the layer of cloud on Venus is
probably also condensed water vapor.
The temperature of this cloud layer his
recently been measured as about 38 de-
grees below zero by Dr. William Sinton
of Johns Hopkins University, using the
200-inch Mount Palomer telescope. This
means that the atmosphere above the
clouds of Venus is too cold to hold any
appreciable wator vapor, explaining the
earlier observations that seemed to indi-
cate water vapor was absent from the at-
mosphere of the planet.
If the clouds are indeed made of water
vapor, there should also be some liquid
water on the planet itself. This must
cover the whole surface, otherwise the
damp rocks protruding would soon absorb
practically all the carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere of Venus. This has not hap-
pened, however, for spesctroscopic ob-
servations prove without doubt that car-
bon dioxide is very abundant there.
This new picture of an ocean-covered
venus makes the possibility of life on our
sister planet more plausible than has
hitherto seemed probable.

ing of the American Institute of Electrical
Engineers, Los Angeles, California, June
21-25, the scientists told of developments
which "will produce significant changes in
virtually every major industry in the
country."
The Westinghouse men who delivered
technical papers at the meeting all are on
the staff of the firm's materials engineer-
ing department in Pittsburgh, Pa. They
are: Dr. R. Louis Bright, Dr. G. F. Pitt-
man, Jr., Dr. Robert A. Ramey, Dr. G. H.
Royer, R. O. Decker, A. P. Kruper, and
E. F. Losco.
One new device expected to have a
far-reaching effect in any application that
requires the conversion of alternating cur-
rent to direct current is a new type of
silicon rectifier described by Mr. Losco.
This experimental device, which has no
moving parts, has an efficiency of ap-
proximately 98 per cent—about 10 per
cent better than the best motor-generator
sets today.
It takes up only a fraction of the space
and does the same job as equipment many
times its size. While commercially avail-
able silicon rectifiers generally produce
less than one watt of power, the new
Westinghouse unit is capable of deliver-
ing a power output of more than 1,200
watts—enough to light 20 sixty-watt
lamps or run a iy2 horsepower motor.
Westinghouse engineers believe the
new rectifier, with modifications in size
and power ratings, will find applications
in computers, in aircraft, radio and tele-
vision power supplies, elesctroplating pro-
cesses, and possibly in the elimination
of certain parts of motor-generator sets.
The technical papers by the other West-
inghouse scientists dealt mainly with the
new uses of transistors in circuits and de-
vices which, in application, are expected
to provide the extremely rugged, reliable
and highly accurate controls necessary for
the "automatic factory" of tomorrow.
Commenting on the papers, Dr.
Stephen J. Angello, manager of the semi-
conductor section in the Westinghouse
materials engineering department, termed
the information they contain as "at least
one important key which will open a new
era more significant than the Industrial
Revolution."
"Three hundred years ago, we entered
what became known as the era of the In-
dustrial Revolution," Dr. Angello said.
"At that time men began substituting me-
chanical power for animal muscle power.
(Continued from page 56)
By World War II the art of using me-
chanical power had reached the point
where practically all major work was be-
ing done by machines. In effect, machines
took over the job of human muscles.
'Today, we are on the verge of develop-
ing complete 'nervouse systems' for those
mechanical muscles—nervous systems
which will not only tell machines and en-
tire production lines what to do but how
to do it, when to do it, and how often to
do it. The use of the new materials such
as silicon, germanium, and others and
such developments as are discussed in
these Westinghouse technical papers will
do much to expand the use of these 'nerv-
ous systems'."
Citing the paper by Dr. Royer, which
discussed the use of two transistors in a
circuit to convert direct current to alter-
nating current, Dr. Angello said the con-
verter described is a device having no
moving parts with an efficiency of 90 per
cent compared to the 50 to 70 per cent
efficiency of an oscillating converter.
The Royer development, Dr. Angello
said, makes possible light weight, high
voltage power supplies and might be use-
ful in Geiger counters and in wall and
ceiling panels which will glow and thus
light a room without conventional light-
ing fixtures. Because the device has no
moving parts, it also would be useful in
the power supply of photoflash equip-
ment.
The paper delivered by Dr. Ramey dis-
cussed the use of transistors to improve
the stability and sensitivity of magnetic
amplifiers—devices already in use as im-
portant parts of control circuits in steel
mills, paper mills and other industrial ap-
plications. By linking the transistors to
the magnetic amplifier, Dr. Ramey said, it
is possible to obtain a much higher ampli-
fication of a signal at lower power. Such
a device would be useful, for example, in
the measurement of temperatures in air-
craft.
'The control devices used in the na-
tion's production lines today have done
and will continue to do their jobs well
for years to come," Dr. Angello said.
"But they have their disadvantages. This
is true in the aircraft and automotive in-
dustries, the steel and paper industries,
the textile and electrical industries, and
many others where high speed, accurate
and reliable controls are necessary. To-
day's controls, however, whether elec-
tronic, rotating, or vibrating contact type,
will wear out or will require replacement
or continued periodic maintenance for
various reasons. The advent of the mag-
netic amplifier has done much to elimi-
nate many of the problems associated
with previous type controls. The new con-
trols will go even further.
"With the new controls that will be
made possible as the result of such West-
inghouse developments, it is unlikely that
an entire paper mill, for example, would
ever be shut down because a set of brushes
on a rotating regulator wore out, or that
an automobile factory would lose
$100,000 in production time because
some control stopped working when a
few drops of oil dripped on it."
"The silicon rectifier is being consider-
ed for possible application in the aircraft
industry," Dr. Angello said, 'because of
its ruggedness and its ability to operate
efficiently at temperatures as high as 39-
degrees Fahrenheit and higher. Rectifiers
made of other materials such as german-
ium have a temperature limit of 140 de-
grees while a selenium rectifier has a tem-
perature limit of 212 degrees in indus-
trial applications.
"Such developments as these in tran-
sistors and silicon rectifiers are opening
new horizons for modern man. Along
with other discoveries being made almost
daily, they portend a new era of new and
better products at lower costs and in
greater quantities."

Airplane design and wind tunnel testing is an integral part of the Aeronautical Engineering
curriculum. The illustration above shows a group of students examining a wind tunnnel model.
Technical progress in the fields of aerodynamics, propulsion, instrumentation, and aircraft struc-
tural design is rapid. Modern supersonic airplanes and guided misiles, powered with jet or rocket
engines, are radically different from the airplanes used only ten years ago. The designer must
therefore rely upon basic scientific analysis rather than upon past experience in the art of air-
craft construction. Aircraft designers have led the modern engineering trend in designing on the
basis of scientific analysis, in contrast to the older procedures of empirical design, testing, and re-
pealed modification.
Aircraft designers have contributed developments in related engineering fields. Gas turbines now
have many non-aviation uses, various light-weight structures and machines are patterned from
aircraft construction, and aerodynamic principles are now used in designing streamlined vehicles,
suspension bridges, and tall buildings.

I'd like to speak for a minute about a matter very
close to my heart. It's not customary for an editor to
spill his magazine's troubles in the lap of the reader,
but I think this is a special case. This concerns the
Technic's abysmally low circulation rate in the
Engineering College.
I don't think I'll be accused of leaping to conclu-
sions when I say that things are not good. For the
last five years total student sales of the Technic
have rarely exceeded 400 copies per month and for a
college of 2000 undergraduates that's pretty damn
bad.
Fortunately, our income doesn't depend entirely
on sales revenue; money from advertising pulls us
through, so I'm not griping about circulation from a
monetary standpoint. It's just that we get a little
frustrated after a while working like the devil to put
out a magazine and then having it pointedly ignored
by the student body.
I can hear Joe Engineer echoing back already.
"Why should I spend money for a bunch of technical
articles and stuff like that. If I want to read about
engineering I can do my homework!" So granted,
perhaps we have been sticking too close to the tech-
nical side of things. We thought technical articles
were the engineer's meat (we still do). But still,
maybe Joe is right, in sticking so close to technical
topics it's easy to become dull and we probably have.
Okay. Resolved: the Staff will try from now on to
liven up the Technic and get read on campus. (As
evidence of our good intentions please note the
jokes, faculty sketches, etc. in this issue.)
However, this is not complete surrender. If we
have to print jokes and features to get more readers,
we will do so. But this remains a technical magazine
and articles of engineering interest will predominate.
This is where the reader, Joe Engineer, comes in. It
is in the best interests of all engineering students to
become familiar with technical publications and to
get used to following them for new developments in
their fields. Technical magazines in industry don't
have to compromise themselves for readers; prac-
ticing engineers all recognize their value. I can't
claim that the Technic has tangible value for readers
here on campus; knowing that Whoosis Chemical
Company has just developed a synthetic fibre from
reclaimed chewing gum isn't going to help with
tomorrow's EM assignment. Someday, however, Joe
Engineer will be looking for a job and a knowledge
of industry (and what products Whoosis Chemical
Company manufacturers) might prove useful. If Joe
Engineer has been following technical periodicals he
knows which companies do what sort of work and
thus has a much better chance of getting the type of
work he wants.
This is our argument for technical magazines and

Solar heating, the adaptation of the
sun's radiation for domestic and indus-
trial uses, promises to make the sun one
of man's most valuable natural resources.
Nurtured in the brains of men for many
centuries, the ideas for utilizing the tre-
mendous energies radiating from the sun
have only recently begun to materialize.
Sun-utilization methods had been min-
utely applied to some early building struc-
tures, but the full potentialities of the sun
were not recognized or explored until
about the nineteen-twenties when results
of concentrated research, experimentation,
and practical application of solar heat fo-
cused national attention on the sun as a
possible source of heat.
When the numerous advantages of
solar heating are closely examined, there
can be only one conclusion: that solar
heat is doubtless the most natural and
advantageous method of heating. The sun
is perpetually radiating heat, and, as far
is man is concerned, it will always be
showering man and earth with its pow-
erful heat and light waves. Yet with this
constant supply of energy available for
use, civilization has long disregarded the
sun and directed its attentions toward ex-
tracting from unrenewable fuel sources in
the earth coal, natural gas, and oil which
at man's present consumption will prob-
ably last little more than 200 years.
The seriousness of the problem of pre-
serving our natural resources has prompt-
ed science to search for new sources of
energy. The oil industry for instance, has
long been seeking substitutes for oil and
natural gas and has spent considerable re-
search funds on synthetic fuels. The ad-
vent of the atomic bomb seemed to open
i gigantic field for energy exploration and
caused historically minded people to class-
ify this era as the "Atomic Age." How-
ever, the notation that there exists
an exhaustable atomic supply is in-
correct and misleading; on the con-
trary, only limited amounts of the fis-
sionable elements, uranium and thorium,
are available, and their use would certain-
ly be restricted by supply, extraction prob-
lems, and cost. One of the chief disad-
vantages in using the atom for energy is
exemplified by the high cost of extracting
md refining fissionable material from the
raw uranium ore for production of the
atomic bomb. Continuous energy sources,
By PAUL GRUNER
therefore, such as vegetation growth,
waterfalls, and the sun's radiation, offer
the scientist the most hopeful field for ex-
ploration. Theoretically, recoverable en-
ergy which is escaping from the earth by
reflection and evaporation of water is
thought to be approximately 54 times our
total energy requirements. In view of all
these facts on atomic and solar energy,
Frank Benedict of Westinghouse made
this statement: 'The sun, not the atom,
may be the principal source of power for
the world in future days."
Exactly how reliable, one may ask, is
the sun that it could be used as a power-
ful source of heat? In the first place, the
prime factor in considering the possibil-
ity of harnessing the sun's heat for every-
day use is the availability of the sun's
heat throughout the year. The United
States Weather Bureau conducted a series
of tests to determine the amount of solar
radiation under different atmospheric con-
ditions. Assuming the heat value on a
clear day to be 100%, 60-80% heat was
found to be radiated on hazy days, and
5.50% on dull cloudy days. Furthermore,
a group of weather tests taken during the
cold season from September 15 to June
15 in eleven midwestern and northern
American cities showed that there was
sunshine for at least half of the total
daylight hours. These tests were conduct-
ed for twenty-year periods during the
part of the year when most northern cities
suffered from cold winds and heavy snows;
yet, the records clearly signify that sun-
shine was able to get through all at-
mospheric obstructions and warm the earth
to some degree. In other words, even
though the sun may not seem to be com-
ing through, it is continually bombarding
man with a plentiful and unending solar
heat.
That man has a tremendous source of
energy at hand is revealed by weather
records and solar radiation tests; how he
would be able to utilize this energy was
the question which scientists long pon-
dered. The final results of years of ex-
perimentation have indeed proved that
man has been successful in his attempts
to harness the sun's heat. Even though
the science of solor heat is relatively new,
enough positive progress has been made
during the past decade to show that solar
heat will probably become a practical,
widely-used method of heating.
The major problem that early research-
ers of solar heat had to consider in adapt-
ing the sun's rays for use throughout the
year, and one which is still the biggest
difficulty, was that of retaining or storing
the heat of the day. To effect complete
solarization of a house, ways had to be
found to collect the heat of the day and
store it for those intervals when there
would be cold weather or little sunshine.

heat to make your summer days cooler; to
store the Arizona sunheat to make your
winter nights warmer." That word
'somehow' is the essence of solar heating.
The whole science of solar heating
could not exist were it not for a number
of fundamental phenomena which are
present in nature. Without these natural
occurrences the sun's rays could not be
captured and put to work. One scientific
fact is that once the sun's rays pass
through a glass enclosure, they cannot
pass out again. This is the very principle
by which greenhouses are able to retain
the sun's heat. In pasing through the class
walls the penetrating short waves of the
sun are transformed into impotent long
waves that merely heat up the inside of
the enclosure. Glass panes reflect about
10% of the sun's heat rays, but most of
the rays penetrate the windows and are
held inside.
Solar heat is made practicable by an-
other phenomenon of nature: the ultra-
violet rays which cause sunburn are filter-
ed out by the glass windows, and only
the heat-containing infra-red rays are ad-
mitted. Furthermore, it is a fact that be-
cause black, carbon black in particular, is
an absorber of heat, objects that have
blacked surfaces are capable of collecting
and retaining large quantities of heat.
The positions of the sun in both summer
and winter are also determining factors
in solar heating. Because the) sun is 45%
higher in midsummer than in midwinter,
eaves and overhangs arc constructed to
shut out the high hot summer sun and
permit the low winter sun to enter.
In the adaptations of solar heat to a
house, the design therefore becomes ex-
tremely important. The windows must be
placed in such a way to get the most
benefit out of the swing of the sun in
winter and summer at different times of
the day. For a solar home large, expansive
south windows with sufficient overhang
are almost a requirement since they cut
out the glancing summer sun and trap
the direct sunlight of winter. North and
west windows usually are eliminated or
carefully used because the sun through
these windows is of little practical use;
cast windows, on the other hand, arc-
often gratifying on cool mornings and
therefore are included in many solar
house designs. To retain the heat that
does enter through the windows, double-
or triple-plate glass windows and dark,
heavy drapes are quite necessary if the
heat is to be kept in the house after sun-
set. Some Arizona homes are constructed
with thick, dark walls which absorb the
day's heat and gradually radiate the stored
heat throughout the room during the
night. In one southwestern home, for ex-
ample, this design kept the room at 72 °F
in 50° weather. The weather records
showed that the sun was giving off sig-
nificant amounts of heat energy to make
solar heating possible, and there were
numerous natural phenomena that made
it practical to use; the object, then, was
to develop ways of harnessing and con-
trolling the energy of the sun.
Most of the early experimental solar
houses employed various methods of
architectural design, particularly vast glass
walls and wide overhangs, to utilize the
rays of the sun, but at the same time regu-
lar fuels were burned on cold nights to
supplement the heat retained from the
sun. The Illinois Institute of Technology
conducted a series of observations for a
year on a solar house near Chicago, and
soon reported findings that astonished
many people. During January of 1942 the
temperature had never risen above 5° be-
low zero; yet, automatic controls set at
72° shut off the auxiliary heat at 8:30
A.M. and did not turn it on again until
8:30 that evening. The sun's rays stream-
ing through the huge south-wall windows
had taken over the job of heating the
house. As one of the early and more

the Chicago house received national at-
tention, but there were other innumerable
instances around the country where the
sun was being used to heat homes. In Cali-
fornia and Florida where there was clear
weather 70% of the time, the sun's heat
wis captured by roof collectors to which
6
were soldered water pipes that led to an
insulated storage tank of at least two days
capacity. However, where water wasn't
always easily obtainable, as in Colorado,
crushed rocks were used to retain the heat
of the sun for the cool nights. In nearly
ill the early solar homes it was found in-
sufficient to do without some form of
supplementary heat; nevertheless, solar
heating was rapidly influencing the de-
sign of the modern house and its heating
apparatus.
But the goal of scientists was to de-
velop a solar house entirely dependent
on the sun for its heating. To accomplish
this aim they found they would have to
determine some way of storing the heat
for nights and cloudy days and some way
of distributing this heat. Recent years
have thus been spent in the quest for ma-
terials or chemicals that are capable of
storing the sun's heat, and the data ob-
tained has been collected and tried in
numerous experimental solar houses in all
parts of the country under varying weath-
er conditions. The use of water as the
means of storing the solar heat was long
considered by scientists, and in fact, the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
employed water as the storage substance
in a 5-room house in Cambridge in 1950.
In this house, built to determine to what
extent direct sunlight could be used in
New England to replace ordinary fuels,
Storage units
the sun supplied 75% of the heat re-
quired for the house. Designed in a mod-
ern style, the house has a flat aluminum
roof upon which is constructed the slop-
ing, black-surfaced collector. After the
water is heated in pipes attached to the
collector, it is pumped into a large, tight-
ly insulated water tank and then circu-
lated throughout pipes in the walls and
floor as radiant heat. The complete circu-
lation process is thermostatically controll-
ed, and the only other heat needed is sup-
plied by electrical heating devices.
The MIT experimental house, the sys-
tem shown above, only 25% depen-
dent on auxiliary heat, started a trend
in sun-heat collectors. Lately, how-
ever, scientists have been working to per-
fect systems which use chemicals, often
sodium compounds, to store the heat from
the collectors. Sodium sulphate or so-
dium phosphate compounds are used in
this type of solar home because they have
low melting points, about 90° F. Nearly
all metals and compounds have a point
or period of melting, called the heat of
fusion, at which they continue for a time
to absorb heat while melting without ris-
ing in temperature. When the heat is
extracted, the compounds will resume a
solid state or recrystallize, and thus the
process may begin again. Because of this
chemical action, some substances are cap-
able of storing 8-10 times more heat than
water.
A 100% solar-heated house was at last
constructed in 1948 by an MIT research
technician, Dr. Maria Telkes, and archi-
tect Eleanor Raymond. The fact that a
totally solarized house was finally perfect-
ed is in itself indicative of progress in
solar heating, but more astonishing is that
it was erected in a cold Massachusetts
area at Dover. Glauber's salts, a sodium
compound, used to retain the collected
heat, was chosen because: it is inexpen-
sive, it is pentiful, and it melts at 90°.
When the salts reach that temperature,
they melt but still absorb heat which is
then released at a convenient rate. Twenty
tons of the chemical could keep the
Dover house at 70° for about ten cloudy
days. But weather records show even
seven consecutive sunless days at one
period for that area to be extraordinary.
The heat is collected on the black metal
surface just behind the huge windows on
the second floor. Electric fans then blow
the heated air over the salt bins and into
the rooms, while other fans draw in the
cold air for reheating. The bins, which
have a capacity of 700 five-gallon cans,
are placed between the first floor rooms to
utilize any escaping heat. The salts, ob-
tained at an initial cost of about one year
of ordinary fuel, can store heat equal to
that of 140 pounds of coal on a clear day
in January, and salts will never deteriorate
or need to be replenished. Electric fans,
therefore, would be the only maintenance
necessary. A heat collector in the Boston
area will heat a space equal to its length
but only about 17 feet behind its front
surface. In addition to the .heating, this
system can be reversed to cool the house
in summer. The ducts of the collector arc
opened at night to permit the cool air
to circulate through the bins arid lower
the temperature of the salts. The specific
heat capacity of the compound is sufficient
to keep the house comfortably cool dur-
ing the hot summer days. By constructing
this five-room house, solely heated by
solar heat, Dr. Telkes has proved that a
solar home can be built in a cold area
and for the low cost of about $1,000.
An indirect method of utilizing the
sun's heat is accomplished through the use
of apparatus called the heat pump. The
earth, it is known, absorbs the heat of
the sun and radiates it to the air. Further-
more, the earth, down deep, is rather un-
affected by temperature changes in the
atmosphere. Wells dug at 30-60 foot
depths recorded a temperature of 70° in
Florida, 50° near Chicago, and approxi-
mately 37° and below north of Lake Su-
perior into Canada. The heat pump takes
heat from the ground, air or water and
converts it through the house and returns
the now cooler substance to its original
source. Some heat pumps use a refriger-
ant which circulates in pipes buried in the
earth. Tending to evaporate, the refriger-
ant absorbs ground heat and delivers it to
the house. Another type of heat pump

INVESTMENT STANDPOINT
By J. CARLTON WARD, JR.
President Vitro Corporation of America
Editor's note: Due to the extreme in-
terest now aroused in private development
of atomic energy we thought this ar-
ticle on the economics of this private
development would be of interest, espec-
ially to those who have been thinking of
going into this field.
In considering a subject as involved as
the present one, it is pertinent to start
with a little history. Since this history,
however, is only a background, we'll make-
it brief.
About 400 B.C. there was an argument
among the ancient Greek philosophers as
to whether there was such a thing as an
atom of material, and a man named
Democritus was given a hard time by the
opponents of this argument. Therefore,
you might say that mankind has specu-
lated about the structure of matter in
terms of atoms for over 2,000 years. In
light of present-day science, it was more
than 2,000 years between the time the
idea was advanced and the existence of
atoms was proven.
I am going to skip from these ancient
days to the year 1890 when a German
scientist, Dr. Heinrich Hertz, first an-
nounced the discovery of electromagnetic
waves. He was followed in 1895 by an-
other German scientist, Dr. Wilhelm
Roentgen, who demonstrated the exis-
tence of X-rays. A year later a French-
man, Dr. Antoine Becquerel, discovered
radio-activity. The following year a
British scientists, Dr. J. J. Thomson, pro-
duced the electron. He, in turn, was fol-
lowed by the French-Polish scientists, the
Curies, who isolated radium and studied
the laws of radioactivity. In 1900, the
German mathematician Max Planck de-
fined a particle of energy by a formula
known as Planck's constant. This was the
basis for the later development of quan-
tum mechanics and wave mechanics which
are the sole means of explaining the be-
havior of atoms.

Theory of Relativity
In 1905, Dr. Albert Einstein, a Swiss-
German, introduced the special theory
of relativity or the interchangeability of
matter and energy. This is the foundation
of the atomic-power industry. Following
Dr. Einstein, Lord Ernest Rutherford, a
New Zealander, discovered the nucleus
of the atom and the transmutation of the
hitherto fundamental chemical elements.
This was the alchemists' dream. Dr. Niels
Bohr, the great Danish scientist, in 1922
received the Nobel Prize for describing
the anatomy of an atom. By 1932, another
Englishman, Dr. James Chadwick, dis-
covered the neutron, and by then Lord
Francis Ashton had described isotopes.
Then followed the work of Enrico Fermi,
the Italian scientist, on the transuranic
higher elements, or manmade elements,
such as plutonium, together with the
principle of modulating neutrons, the
process of which he patented, and which
was appropriated by the government in
the development of atomic power and re-
actors. In 1939, Drs. Otto Hahn and
Fritz Strassman discovered fission, and by
it man has learned to extract energy from
atoms. The Japanese, Hideki Yukawa, had
in 1935 foretold the discovery of mesons
and subatomic particles, the basis of
much of the cosmic-ray theory.
You will note that Americans are
strangely absent from this picture, al-
though it was in America and under the
American system that all of this theoreti-
cal knowledge was harnessed and today
offers the opportunity for a new age that
will change all aspects of life on this
planet.
All this fundamental research pre-
ceded these practical developments in
atomic energy by a great many years.
Since this country of ours was always a
pioneer, and is very successful in practical
matters, we tend to undervaluate and play
down the role of fundamental research,
or what you might call the role of the
"long hairs" and "egg heads." It is ac-
tually the most fundamental part of the
14
MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Now I should like to forget for the
minute the intricacies of atomic science
and discuss what might happen in the
field of development and potential in-
vestment.
I would like to point to the Paley Re-
port ( 1) which, as you know, is a recent
government report on the natural re-
sources of the United States. It shows
that the so-called fosil fuels, which are
coal, oil, and gas, will be insufficient to
maintain the current rate of our economy
and the expansion of our economy by the
year 2023. That means that our grand-
children are going to be in a power-
starved economy unless something is
done.
The fossil fuels are being depleted at
an even faster rate because they are be-
coming increasingly valuable as sources
of chemicals. You must be conscious of
the great developments in petroleum
chemicals and in the hydrogenation of
coal.
Next Stage in Man's Development
Atomic energy therefore seems to be
the next stage of man's development in
processing his economy. It was an act of
war that brought this applied science into
being in a much shorter period of time
than otherwise would have occurred. It
was our need to defend our own civiliza-
tion that in this way is presenting to you
this new opportunity for investment.
Atomic Versus Fossil Fuels
There is estimated to be, by the Atomic
Energy Commission, about 25 times as
much potential fuel in the earth's crust
in the form of atomic fuels as there is in
the so-called fosil fuels (see Fig. 1).
Most of you know that waterpower does
not play a dominant role in the power
economy.
I don't know how many of you have
taken a curve of the standard of living in
the United States from 1902 to date in
terms of what may be laughingly called
'standard dollars" and applied to it the
curve for the consumption of power in
the United States, in each case reduced to
per-capita population. You will find that
the curves are synonymous. Money is
merely a form of IOU's or chips which
vou count as your stakes in the economic
game, but it is the amount of power used
that determines the standard of living
(see Fig. 2).
Not too long ago there was a series of
estimates by Lawrence R. Hafstad of the
A.E.C., A. C. Monteith of Westinghouse
Electric and others (2), which in many
respects are already obsolete. In some
ways they make me think of my long as-
sociation with the aircraft industry. We
had a saying that, when an airplane is a
finished design on the drawing board, it
is already obsolete. That is certainly true
in that industry, and similar examples
can be stated as equally true in this indus-
try.
Therefore, the statements which I am
quoting from their reports are not only
the opinions of forward-thinking engi-
neers and scientists, but they may simi-
larly be already out of date. This careful
study showed that in their average
opinion 11% of the new power that
would be brought in within the next ten
years will be atomic power.
To reduce this to a figure with which
we can deal statistically, we start with
100 million kilowatts of installed power
in the United States today. According
to long experience in industry, we will
develop in the next ten years enough new
power to double that. We then apply
11% to this increase, which means that
11 million kilowatts of atomic power will
be brought in in the next ten years. A
staggering financial requirement in this
new field!
Power Doubles Every Ten Years
It is a well known fact in the power
industry that this country has approxi-
mately doubled its power every ten years.
In other words, the plans of the utilities
are to expand twice their present size in
the next ten years. Most of you know
they have already expanded to twice the
size they were ten years ago.
The plans for expansion are relatively
firm for the next three or four years. The
amount of money that it will take in to-
day's currency is roughly $200 per kilo-
watt-hour of capacity for central stations.
If you multiply the figure of 100 million
kilowatts of installed power by $200, you
will see that $20 billion must be supplied
for the expansion of the utility industry
in the next ten years.
If 11% of the power to be added in
the next ten years has to be brought in as
atomic power, and if atomic power costs
no more than customary steam power
plants in being today, you can readily
figure that there are going to be billions

SHOULD THE CLASSES
PAST EXPERIENCE HAS SHOWN CLASS ORGANIZATION TO BE UN-
WORKABLE AND AN EXPERIMENT NOW WOULD DISRUPT THE ENTIRE
SYSTEM OF STUDENT GOVERNMENT IN COLLEGE.
By CHARLES STICKELS, '55 ChE
Editor's Note: Last spring the freshman class elected an Engineering
Class Board to represent them for their Sophomore year. This fall the
Board was recognized by the Student Affairs Committee and its presi-
dent seated on the Engineering Council.
Because the Sophomore Board seeks to represent all sophomore
engineers regardless of department, and because the Engineering
Council is organized on a representation-by-departments basis, this new
board stirred up considerable controversy.
The central element in this controversy is the desirability of repre-
sentation by classes vs. representation by departments. This is the
issue which the Technic is presenting.
Speaking for class representation is Brian Moriarty, former President
of the Freshman Engineering Council and present Secretary-Treasurer
of the Sophomore Engineering Class Board. Taking the "con" in the
discussion is Chuck Stickels, Secretary-Treasurer of the Engineering
Council and Editor of the Technic.
Neither man's views should be construed to represent the opinions
of any groups to which he belongs; what follows is strictly personal
opinion.
Is every student in the College of
Engineering represented in the college's
activities? Is the present system of depart-
mental organization an efficient, represen-
tative system? Is there a strong student
spirit toward the college's functions?
These questions are the subject of a con-
troversial issue facing the students in the
College of Engineering. The departmen-
tal system of representation is inadequate
to serve engineering students; a class-or-
ganized system representing all students
would achieve a more united spirit to-
ward the college and promote greater stu-
dent participation in college affairs.
The departmental societies represent
only a small fraction of the engineering
students in their departments. For ex-
ample, there were 175 students in the
Civil Engineering Department during the
fall semester, 1953-54, but only 57 were
members of the A.S.C.E. (American So-
ciety of Civil Engineers). During the
spring semester, 1953-54, 66 out of 152
civil engineering students belonged to the
A.S.C.E. Now, in the present fall semes-
ter, 1954-55, only 51 civil engineering
students out of a total of 188 joined the
A.S.C.E. How can this society hope to
be a representative organization with such
a limited number of members? The an-
swer is that the A.S.C.E. cannot be a
representative society for, as stated, only
27.1% (51 out of 188) of the students
this semester are participating in this so-
ciety.
Similarly, the percentage of students in
other departmental societies is very low.
The following figures are for the present
fall semester, 1954-55. Only 92 electrical
engineers out of a total 327 students in
the Electrical Engineering Department
joined the A.I.E.E. (American Institute
of Electrical Engineers). Out of 197
chemical engineering students, only 78
joined the A. I. Ch. E. (American Insti-
tute of Chemical Engineers). The
A.S.T.E. (American Society of Tool Engi-
neers) and the A.F.S. (American Foun-
drymen's Society), which represent a ma-
jority of industrial and mechanical engi-
neering students, have a combined mem-
bership of 113 for the present semester.
The A.S.M.E. (American Society of Me-
chanical Engineers) represents only 41
students from the Mechanical Engineering
Department. However, there are 187 stu-
dents in the Industrial Department and
364 in the Mechanical Department. Last-
ly, the I.A.S. (Institute of Aeronautical
Science) has only 5 student members,
compared to 130 enrolled in the Aero-
nautical Department.
The following is a summation of the
total number of students in the Aeronau-
tical, Chemical, Civil, Electrical, Indus-
trial, and Mechanical Engineering depart-
ments. Alongside are the actual number
of students in the departmental societies
(A.S.C.E., A.I.Ch.E., A.I.E.E., I.A.S.,
A.S.T.E., A.F.S., and A.S.M.E.), which
represent the above listed departments.
This comparison is for the last three se-
mesters.
These figures show conclusively that de-
partmental societies represent a limited
percentage of students. In fact, 68.75%
of the students in the six major depart-
ments (listed above) are not participating
in departmental societies this semester.
Why is representation needed for all
students? First, departmental societies arc-
not benefiting the majority of students
in the departments. In the first place,
student opinion cannot be expressed
through a departmental society, since that
society does not represent a majority of
the students in the department. In the
second place, activities cannot be planned
for the students of the department, be-
cause of the small percentage of partici-
pation in the department society. Accord-
ingly, if the students will not support the
society, the society cannot benefit all stu-
dents.
The loyalty of the departmental society
is restricted to a particular department.
For instance, the I.A.S. organizes air
flights for its student members. Thus, the
loyalty and spirit of I.A.S. is specifically
limited to the Aeronautical Department.
Since each departmental society has as
its major objective the benefit of student
members in the department, there is no
common meeting ground for the societies.
As a result, there is no engineering class
spirit, but only an independent depart-
mental spirit.
The class organization can correct the
inadequacies of the departmental society.
First, there is complete representation of
every student in the class. The class, as a

YES: CLASS ORGANIZATION WILL COORDINATE AND CREATE MORE
ACTIVITIES FOR ALL ENGINEERS.
There has been a lot of talk recently
ibout "getting the departments together"
in the Engineering College; the idea in
mind, apparently, being to draw engi-
neers out of their specialties and to en-
courage them to broaden their outlooks
and interests.
This way of thinking has consumated
in the "class unity" concept, which sets
is its goal the interdepartmental unity of
Freshmen, Sophomores, Juniors, and
Seniors as opposed to the present ten-
dency toward the departmental unity of
Electricals, Civils, Mechanicals, etc. One
of the areas which this idea has invaded
full force is, naturally enough, student
government in the Engineering College
ind its effects here have been of such a
nature that close analysis and inspection
is warranted.
Coordinating body for student activi-
ties in the Engineering College is the
Engineering Council, composed of the
president of eight student professional
societies (one society representing each
department), and the top officers from
the Michigan Technic, Tau Beta Pi, the
Honor Council, the Freshman Council,
the President of the Senior Class, and five
xembers-at-large. The presidents of the
vinous professional societies are the elect-
ed representatives of the sophomores,
juniors, and seniors in that department.
The Freshman Council represents the
^departmentalized freshman class. The
Senior Class President is the representa-
tive of the college on the all-campus
Senior Board. The officers from the Honor
Council, Tau Beta Pi, and the Michigan
Technic represent all-college organiza-
tions whose influence is felt by all stu-
dents regardless of class or department.
Now into this picture has recently
-ttpped the Sophomore Engineering
Class Board, a group of people elected
by last year's freshman engineering
dass at the close of the spring semes-
ter. This group has been recognized
by the Student Affairs Committee,
*ited on the Engineering Council,
md is a functioning body purporting
By BRIAN MORIARTY, '57 EE
to represent the Sophomore Engineering
Class. What the precise function of the
Sophomore Board will be is not too clear
at this time, but they undoubtedly have in
mind organizing and coordinating activi-
ties for the Sophomore Class, and serving
as a sounding board for the particular
needs of the Sophomore Class. But is
this necessary? What are the special
needs of the sophomore class that require
such particular attention? And, where
does this Sophomore Board fit into the
overall pattern of student government in
the college?
The people who have organized this
Sophomore Board have failed to realize,
apparently, that the entire system of stu-
dent government in the college is built
around departmental representation (at
the heart of which are the professional so-
cieties) and their introduction of elements
of class representation is not only useless,
but tends to disrupt a carefully planned
system of student representation.
There were very good reasons why the
student government was organized as it is.
Failure of previous student governments
in the college has largely been due to lack
of support from the student body. This
was thought to be best remedied by plac-
ing the acknowledged leaders of the stu-
dent body (i.e. the top officers in college
organizations) on one council. The re-
sulting departmental representation as-
sumed that the problems of sophomores,
juniors, and seniors in any one department
were more liable to be similar than prob-
lems of all sophomores, all juniors, or
all seniors. To obtain other qualified per-
sonnel and to make representation more
all-inclusive, members-at-large were in-
cluded on the Council. (Present members-
at-large include members of Triangles
and Vulcans honoraries, a past officer of
the Michigan Union, and other people
active in all-campus as well as college ac-
tivities.)
The principle argument against organi-
zation by classes was the difficulty of ob-
taining a group of really capable men by
popular vote and the analogous difficulty
of educating the student body as to the
relative qualifications of various candi-
dates. Note, for example, the difficulties
SL has had along these lines. SL has never
made popular representation work and
is presently attempting to solve its prob-
lems by disbanding and forming a Stu-
dent Government Council. Appointed
members of the Council will include rep-
resentatives from IHC, IFC, the Michi-
gan Union, the Women's League, and the
Michigan Daily. The similarity between
this system and our Engineering Council
is rather striking.
At this point I think it should be
understood that there is nothing funda-
mentally wrong with either the "unified
class" or the departmental approach to
student representation in government.
Both systems are means to the same end.
But the point I'd like to make is that
organization of the sophomore class (or
the junior class, or the senior class as
such) in our present set-up is something
less than useful and may, in fact, hinder
progress of student government in the
college.
What is to be done? If it is thought
that representation by classes (even in the
light of aforementioned weaknesses) is
substantially superior to departmental
representation, then the classes must be
organized and the structure of student
government must be altered. But the very
ease and smoothness with which depart-
mental organization and representation
have been working in the past seems, to
me, to preclude any such move. If the ad-
vantages of the "unified class" approach
are not overwhelming in number, and at
this point they don't seem to be, then re-
vision of our present government would
be a foolish and dangerous step.
The only other logical move left, if the
above conclusions are valid, is to maxi-
mize the strength of our present system of
departmental representation and the first
step in this direction would be to aban-
don the Sophomore Board. If this seems
hard, it is certainly much easier than re-

Professor John S. McNown
The faculty of the Engineering College
has had another outstanding personality
added to its ranks. He is John Stephenson
McNown. Professor McNown came to us
from the State University of Iowa where
he worked his way up from a position as
assistant professor to the full professor-
ship. Previous to his teaching at Iowa,
he was an instructor at the University of
Minnesota for five years while working
on his Doctor's degree. While connected
with Iowa he was a member of the fol-
lowing committees: Research Facilities,
International Relations, Calendar and
Library.
Professor McNown holds four degrees;
a Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineer-
ing from the University of Kansas, Mas-
ter of Science from the State University
of Iowa, the Doctorate from the Univer-
sity of Minnesota and the Docteur e's
Science from the University of Grenoble
in France. He conducted research in
France under a Fulbright scholarship
which was awarded to him by the State
Department.
While teaching and conducting re-
search work, he still found time to marry,
raise two sons and a daughter, hold down
three consultant positions and lead a
troop of Cub Scouts through the Iowa
wilderness.
Our renowned professor, whose name
can be found in the "Who's Who in En-
gineering" yearbook, is, at present, a
member of some six professional societies.
Among them is the American Society of
Civil Engineers, for which he is a mem-
ber of the executive committee for the
Engineering Mechanics division. The rest
of the list includes the American Geo-
physical Union, the International Asso-
ciation for Hydraulic Research, the Amer-
ican Society for Engineering Education,
Sigma Xi and Tau Beta Pi. He received
the J. C. Stevens Award for one of his
twenty-five papers that have appeared in
the journals of these societies.
Professor McNown served as an expert
consultant for the St. Paul district of the
U. S. Army Engineering Department. His
other two consultant positions are with
the Bureau of Public Roads and with the
Sandia Corporation, a contractor of the
Atomic Energy Commission.
His technical interests lean toward fluid
Prof. McNown
mechanics. His interest and qualification
in this field are verified by the fact that
he is teaching E.M. 4 (Fluid Mechanics)
here at Michigan. He has done research
work both in this and the related field
of Oceanography.
Professor McNown, a Phi Delta Theta
alumnus, recently finished a series of
technical lectures in Bogata, South Amer-
ica.Upon further questioning, however, he
admitted that he much preferred teaching
here at Michigan where his students are
presumably not quite so violent.
But all these accomplishments are only
a start, for his greatest achievements sure-
ly lie ahead as a faculty member of the
College of Engineering of the Unversity
of Michigan.
Professor E. Wendell Hewson
In July of '53 an outstanding member
of the meteorological profession joined
the faculty here. Professor Hewson was
born in Nova Scotia about forty years
ago. He then proceeded to educate him-
self which he did most thoroughly. After
obtaining an engineering certificate and
a B.A. (First Class Honors in Physics)
in 1932, at Mount Allison University, he
got an M.A. in Physics at Dalhousie Uni-
versity in 1933. He then concentrated on
Meteorology getting his M.A. (Meteor-
ology) in 1935 at the University of To-
ronto; he married in the summer of that
year. Winning the Beit Scientific Research
Fellowship enabled them to cross- the
ocean and him to get his D.I.C. (Meteor-
ology [a special British degree]) at the
Imperial College of Science &amp; Technology
in 1937. At the same time he earned his
Ph.D. (in meteorology) at the Univer-
sity of London.
During this time the Hewsons man-
aged to cover most of Europe from Scan-
dinavia to Italy. They made these tours
on a very tight budget and Professor
Hewson laughs now as he thinks back to
those days and remembers how one night
in Stockholm the only hotel they could
find was very expensive and made a
sizable dent in his not overfilled wallet.
This necessitated several days of skimp-
ing to make up for it.
While at the Imperial College of Sci-
ence &amp; Technology, Hewson won a Royal
Society of Canada Fellowship. A year
later, in 1939, he was awarded the
Buchan Prize of the Royal Meteorological
Society for scientific communications
printed in the Quarterly Journal of the
Society. This was the first time the prize
had been given to a person outside the
British Isles.
By this time Hewson was employed
as a Research Meteorologist by the
Meteorological Service of Canada, a job
which he held for nine years. During
this time he also did some consulting for
Consolidated Mining and Smelting of
Canada and the U. S. Bureau of Mines.
This led to some of his most important
work. It concerned the air pollution by
SO;, from a smelting plant and the effects
of it on nearby farmland. Since this oc-
curred near the boundary between the
U.S. and Canada it involved both coun-
tries. With the work done on this particu-
lar problem and on others since, Profes-
sor Hewson has learned quite a bit about
air pollution. Since coming to Michigan
he has been working in close association
with Professor R. H. Sherlock of the De-
partment of Civil Engineering on air pol-
lution problems of large power utilities.
After the war started in 1939 Profes-
sor Hewson was kept very busy teaching
meteorology for the Canadian Govern-
ment, as with the advent of aerial war-
fare and mass landings meteorology has
become a very important part of military
strategy.

How a Vk hour ^gem-cutting" operation
became an 8-minute mechanized job
PROBLEM: Preparing quartz
crystals for use as electronic
frequency controls calls for
the highest degree of preci-
sion. So much so, in fact, that prior to World
War II skilled gem-cutters were employed
to do the job.
But during the war, there were not enough
gem-cutters to keep up with the demand for
crystals in radar, military communications
and other applications.
Western Electric tackled the job of build-
ing into machines the skill and precision that
had previously called for the most highly
skilled operators.
SOLUTION: Here is how quartz crystals are
made now—by semi-skilled labor in a fraction
of the time formerly required:
A quartz stone is sliced into wafers on a
reciprocating diamond-edged saw, after de-
termination of optical and electrical axes by
means of an oil bath and an X-ray machine.
Hairline accuracy is assured by an orienting
fixture.
The wafers are cut into rectangles on ma-
chines equipped with diamond saws. The
human element is practically eliminated by
means of adjustable stops and other semi-
automatic features.
The quartz rectangles are lapped automatic-
ally to a thickness tolerance of plus or minus
.0001". A timer prevents overlapping. Finally,
edges are ground to specific length and width
dimensions on machines with fully automatic
microfeed systems.
Most of these machines were either com-
pletely or largely designed and developed by
Western Electric engineers.
RESULTS: With skill built into the machines
—with costly hand operations eliminated—
this Western Electric mechanization program
raised production of quartz crystals from a
few thousand a year to nearly a million a
month during the war years. This is just one
of the many unusual jobs undertaken and
solved by Western Electric engineers.
Quartz stones are cut into wafers on this diamond-edged saw,
with orientation to optical axis controlled by fixture. This is
just one of several types of machines designed and developed
by Western Electric engineers to mechanize quartz cutting.

is capable of extracting 10° of heat from
the water of the well. A refrigerant,
Freon 12, which boils at a low 40°, ab-
sorbs the heat of the water and flows to
the compressor where the Freon 12 is
condensed. At a pressure of 160 pounds
per square inch, the Freon 12 rises to a
temperature of 160°. From the compres-
sor the refrigerant is pushed through ra-
diators, and there the Freon 12 gives off
At/tf-lwmm4r Sun
heat to the air. Erected in a five-room
house at $1,500 and above, the pump
would cost about $120 or more each year
to be maintained at low electricity rates.
Hence, a heat pump set-up would be most
practical in an area where electricity is
cheap and the ground sufficiently warm.
There are a variety of house designs in
which heat storage units can be con-
structed:
Most of these designs are of a rectang-
ular shape and use the windows and the
walls to retain the sun's heat. However,
not all designs need to be rectangular.
Architect Frank Lloyd Wright helped
prove this by constructing a hemicycle
solar house which would take full ad-
vantage of the elliptical path of the sun
and make the sun's heat incorporate in
the design.
All in all, the best design for a solar
house would make full use of the sun
with large glass windows to the south,
dark surfaces and materials such as dark
walls, draperies, and roof collectors to
absorb the sun's heat, adequate insulation,
and some way of capturing, storing, and
distributing the sun's heat.
Science is always looking for new uses
for the sun's rays, in heating and other-
wise. On the basis of the results obtained
through experimentation and testing of
solar homes, the future looks bright.
Moreover, long studies of the northward
shift of warm-climate birds and animals
show strong signs that the earth is grad-
ually becoming warmer and, in turn, more
adaptable for solar heating. One use of
the sun's heat is being tried in farming.
There is yet small actual development
in solar heating, but the trend is started
and the results thus far are quite satisfy-
ing. The advantages of solar heating far
outweigh the objections to it such as the
initial cost and the need for special de-
sign. In the first place, the maintenance
costs in the long run will be minute in
comparison to the expense of other fuels.

Furthermore, there is a low operational

there is no smoke or disposal; fuel is
saved for other uses; and the whole feel-
ing is one of beauty and pleasure.
The possibilities for utilization of the
sun's energy are numerous and vast in
scope. Besides heating, the sun can be
used in water distillation, chemical ac-
tions, and electric-power production. In
the words of Dr. Telkes of MIT: "It's the
world's greatest untapped energy resource,
and its utilization should be one of our
most important and fruitful projects."
It's utilization—that is the challenge.

Clarence ffDing" Bell answers:
Well, if I said "All sorts," it might sound a bit vague to
you, Del, but it would be very close to the truth. That's
because technical sales work at Du Pont—bearing in
mind the great diversity of products we have—is broader
in scope than a lot of other technical assignments, and
requires additional talents.
Let's suppose that one of Du Pont's customers is
having technical difficulties—needs help in adapting
"Teflon" to a specific gasketing application, for exam-
ple. When our sales representative calls, he naturally
must carry with him the engineering knowledge that's
the basis for sound technical advice—data on flexural
fatigue, chemical passivity, and deformation under load.
The customer is receptive. He wants to make a better
product, increase his sales, reduce costs—or do all three.
Naturally, he's looking for reliable technical advice and
intelligent actions that apply to his specific conditions.
With the cooperation of the customer and help from
our own research people, when necessary, the problem
will sooner or later be "licked."
We have found, though, that if a technical service

American Cities
Consisting of more than 1,500,000 in-
dividual parts, the dramatic Nike, with
its approximately 300 highly complex
electronic "brain cells," is the first sur-
face-to-air guided-missile system to be put
into service around U. S. cities.
Nike is the answer to Army Ordnance's
call for a new defensive weapon that will
meet an aerial target in its own element
and on its own terms. Such a weapon had
to be highly maneuverable throughout its
flight. And matching speed with speed
would not be sufficient, since the initiative
would remain with an enemy plane.
The end product of eight years' guided
missile research, Nike is the only super-
sonic anti-aircraft missile thus far an-
nounced that can follow and destroy an
enemy target despite its evasive action. Es-
sentially a defensive weapon, the Nike
system is highly mobile and will work in
any weather—even when visibility is zero.
The system consists essentially of two
parts: an expendable aerodynamic, liquid-
fueled misile and the highly elaborate
million-and-a-half part control network.
Named after the goddess of victory of
Greek mythology, this fantastic new sys-
tem and accompanying radar equipment is
currently being mass produced for Army
Ordnance by Western Electric, the manu-
facturing and supply unit of the Bell Sys-
tem. As prime contractor, Western co-
oordinates its own vast manufacturing
and engineering operation with activities
of hundreds of subcontractors in twenty
states, who each contribute something to
Nike.
Several large vans are needed to house
the vast array of electronic equipment in
the control system. Aside from the 20-
foot missile and its booster rocket the
other principal units include radars and
launching equipment.
Here is how Nike works:
1. The Nike battery receives early
warning from the air warning net that
hostile aircraft are approaching.
2. The target is picked up and tracked
electronically.
3. Nike missiles are readied in vertical
position on their launching racks.
4. A running account of the target's
Edited by RICHARD SCHREIBER
changing position is transmitted to the
control center.
5. The missile's control mechanism,
stabilization and navigational gear are
checked and safety mechanisms are disen-
gaged.
6. As the target crosses an invisible
deadline the Nike missile is fired.
7. Within seconds after the launching
the Nike missile has passed through the
sonic barrier and is in supersonic flight,
riding smoothly on its own rocket engine.
8. The complex electronic equipment
continues to guide the Nike missile as it
converges on the target.
9. The missile intercepts the target and
explodes.
Safer and Easier Driving at Night
Provided By Improved G-E Headlamp:
A new, brighter, sealed-beam automo-
bile headlamp, designed to increase visi-
bility in clear weather, but especially in
rain, snow, fog, and dust, was introduced
October 28 by the General Electric Com-
pany.
As a result of this development, de-
scribed by G. E. as the most important in
automotive headlighting since the all-
glass, sealed-beam headlamp was intro-
duced in 1939, driving at night and in
poor-visibility conditions is expected to
be both safer and easier for America's
motorists.
Now in production, the new G-E lamps

lamps. They will be available to motor-
ists for replacement on existing cars in
39 states, beginning in December.
Improved lamps will be standard equip-
ment on new cars after the other nine
states have made necessary law changes.
All state approvals are expected to have
been made by mid-1955.
G.E.'s "All-Weather" headlamps will
give more powerful and better-controlled
headlighting than has been available here-
tofore, according to General Electric's
automotive lighting experts. Here's what
the improvements mean to the motorist:
The high beam, or driving beam, gives
25 per cent more light. The beam pattern
remains virtually unchanged, but the
driver should be able to see objects about
100 feet farther from the car than with
existing upper beams.
The low beam, or passing beam, pro-
duces about 23 per cent more light and,
more important, directs twice as much
light down the right side of the road,
where it is needed most. The driver will
be able to see a pedestrian as much as 80
feet farther ahead.
The improved low beam greatly reduces
the upward "spill" light, which becomes
blinding when it is reflected to the eyes
by fog, snow, rain, or dust. As a result, it
is as effective in poor visibility conditions
as special fog lamps.
Control of the lower beam is such that,
if the lamps are properly aimed, glare is
reduced for approaching motorists in the
critical passing zone.
Several modifications have been made
in the design of the new headlamps to
effect their improved performance.
Upper and lower beams are stronger
because new G-E filaments, 7 per cent
more efficient, are operated at higher wat-
tages—50 and 40 watts, respectively, in-
stead of 45 and 35.
A little metallic hood above the low-
beam filament keeps stray light from
shining upward to be reflected into the
driver's eyes.
The reflector is tilted two degrees
downward, this also to reduce up-shining
light.
The lens is redesigned to give better
distribution of lower beam light down
the right-hand side of the road, and also
to prevent upward-directed light.
The new headlamp is completely inter-
changeable physically with existing seal-
ed beam headlamps, the only visible dif-
ference, externally or internally, being the
small cap above the lower-beam filament.
It's advantages are most apparent when it

light forward and downward is demonstrated here by Val J. Roper, G-E illuminating

is used in pairs.
The improved headlighting develop-
ment is the outgrowth of industry-wide
cooperative program in which lamp manu-
facturers, automobile manufacturers, and
state motor vehicle administrators par-
ticipated.
The American Association of Motor
Vehicle Administrators, which requested
the improvement program, has unanim-
ously endorsed the new lamps as fully
incorporating their requested improve-
ments, and has urged that all states adopt
the necessary statutory revisions as soon
as possible.
General Electric's "All-Weather" seal-
ed-beam headlamps are now approved in
most of the 48 states and in all Canadian
provinces. Approvals are pending in
Colorado, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Kan-
sas, Missouri, South Carolina, Washing-
ton, and West Virginia, which have not
had the opportunity yet to change their
laws.
Prices of "All-Weather" headlamps
are: 6-voIt, $1.80 per lamp; 12-volt,
$1.90 per lamp.
Radiation Comes on North Campus
Workmen are completing two rooms
in a new University of Michigan building
that have walls of the heaviest concrete
ever poured in the state, doors that weigh
nine tons each, and windows three feet
thick. Their ceilings are slabs of concrete
four feet deep, the "wallpaper" is three-
eighths-inch steel plate, and the electricity
for them flows through special armored
conduits.
The rooms are not intended to hold
bars of gold or America's ten most want-
ed criminals—as "radiation caves" in the
half-completed Phoenix Building on the
new North Campus, they will one day
house radio-active materials from the Uni-
versity's million-dollar reactor next door
and from other sources.
Plans for the reactor are nearly com-
pleted, and construction is expected to
begin early next year. Located on the
first floor and at the northern end of the
Phoenix Building, the caves stand a few
yards from the site designated for the re-
actor.
The building will be the headquarters
of the Michigan Memorial-Phoenix Proj-
ect, the University's research program
dedicated to the memory of U-M World
War II dead and devoted to the study of
peacetime uses and effects of atomic en-
ergy. It is being built from funds con-
tributed by alumni, faculty members, stu-
dents, industrial groups and other friends
of the University.
A gift from the Ford Motor Company
has made possible construction of the re-
actor.
Elaborate precautions have been taken
to make the area around the caves com-
pletely safe. In fact, Phoenix officials
point out that workers in adjacent labora-
tories will ordinarily receive more ra-
diation from the radium dials of their
wrist watches than from materials inside
the caves.
Although most of the substances
brought into the caves will probably not
exceed three to four kilocuries, the rug-
ged chambers are designed to hold mater-
ials from eight to ten kilocuries in ac-
tivity.

times the radiation emitted by a gram
of radium.
Samples will be transferred to the caves
in lead containers after being activated in
the nuclear reactor. Michigan scientists,
watching through special two-ton win-
dows, will then open the containers and
tonduct experiments by remote control.
They will operate mechanical arms
with hand graps and tongs at the end so
sensitive they can write a name, peel a
banana or measure out precise amounts
of "hot" chemicals.
In experiments designed to determine
how irradiation affects the machinability
and strength of metals, for example, the
arms will fit samples into lathes, testing
machines and other devices, then perform
the operations.
Should there be radioactive scraps left
over, the arms will sweep them up and
place them in lead "coffins" for transfer
to special storage areas.
Housecleaning is expected to be a sim-
ple matter. The welded steel walls have
been sandblasted clean and covered with
four coats of special vinyl plastic paint, to
which radioactive particles will find it
hard to cling. The walls and equipment
will be hosed down after each test to
remove residual radioactivity.
Seventy yards of high-density concrete
are sandwiched between the steel shells
of each cave. One and one-half times the
weight of ordinary concrete, the 220-
pound-per-cubic-foot mixture is made ex-
tra dense by the use of barytes stone for
the aggregate. Quarried in Tennessee, the
stone is unusually heavy.
Density is important in shielding ma-
terials because the heavier and closer the
atoms, the more likely it is that radioac-
tive particles or rays will collide with
them. Effectiveness of a shield is still
further increased if it combines great
thickness with density, as in the three-
feet walls of the caves.
The glass windows are as impenetrable
as the walls. Of a new design, each win-
dow as made up of six four-inch-thick
sheets of cerium-stabilized lead glass. Use
of cerium in the glass prevents browning
under radiation. The spaces between the
sheets are filled with sixty-gallons of
white mineral oil.
Scientists will slide open solid steel
doors to enter the caves. Each cave has
two doors, 14 inches thick, that join in a
tongue-and-groove arrangement and over-

lap the door frames by two feet at the
sides.
Laboratories in the new building will
be so arranged that those planned for
research involving the highest intensities
of radiation will be nearest the caves.
The radiation employed will decrease
progressively in laboratories further re-
moved from the caves, both on the same
floor and those overhead.
Thus rooms adjoining the caves will be
used for the "hottest" chemistry experi-
ments, for example, while those at the
other end of the building will house low-
intensity tests and administrative offices.
Nuclear Fuels Alone Can Provide
Tomorrow's Energy Needs
Only nuclear fuels offer hope for the
tremendous energy needs of tomorrow,
the General Electric Company's top
atomic executive said recently.
Francis K. McCune, general manager
of the G-E Atomic Products Division,
said that only by our taking immediate
action to put atomic energy to economic
use can tomorrow's economy hope to sur-
vive without the need for jarring adjust-
ments."
In speaking to the Independent Nat-
ural Gas Asociation of America, he de-
clared:
"If 'low cost' energy is going to deter-
mine our very economic life, then fossil
fuels (coal, oil and gas) will have to,
in the next 25 years, begin to carry more-
load than reports indicate they are capable
of. The hypothetical energy systems of the
future can be, in the main, carried only
by a dramatic new source of energy."
Use of solar energy to replace fossil
fuels 'would be prohibitively expensive,"
he stated.
In looking over future uses of atomic
energy, he said that it is promising as a
means of producing electric power. Its
use for transportation and heating, he
said, looks only moderately promising.
"In the field of transportation," he
said, "the start of an atomic Navy has al-
ready been made. I am practically certain
that atomic-powered military aircraft can
be produced and will have capabilities

MOST OF THE RESEARCH WORK that led to the development of
Ultraforming—a more efficient and economical refining process— took
place in the Whiting research laboratories of Standard Oil, above.
Extensive studies in seventeen research-scale units demonstrated
the merits of cyclic regeneration.
Standard Oil scientists develop Ultraforming—
the latest in catalytic reforming
After several years of research, Standard Oil
scientists have developed a new and important
refining process—Ultraforming.
The process is a better way of improving the
low-octane straight-run gasoline found in crude
oil. To make such gasoline suitable for present
day cars, refiners must change it into an en-
tirely different material, which gives good anti-
knock performance. The change is known as
reforming.
Ultraforming is the last word in catalytic
reforming. It gives greater yields of higher
octane gasoline than were previously possible
and gets good results even with poor feed
stocks. In addition, it raises the yield of
hydrogen, an increasingly valuable by-product
of catalytic reforming.
Ultraforming units do not have to be shut
down when the catalyst begins to lose activity
through use. By a new technique, an im-
proved platinum catalyst is regenerated to
maintain peak performance.
The advantages of Ultraforming over pre-
vious methods are so great that Standard Oil
and its subsidiary companies are building units
at four refineries. They will start operating
this year. The new process, of course, is avail-
able to the petroleum industry through licens-
ing arrangements.
At Standard Oil, young engineers and chem-
ists work with the stimulating knowledge that
they are participating in important and last-
ing contributions to the oil industry and to
their country.

The G-E atomic boss pointed out, how-
ever, that there seem to be few other
transportation possibilities for atomic
energy "except for. of course, atomic-elec-
tric applications."
"I doubt if I will ever see practical,
economically-useful locomotives, automo-
biles, trucks or commercial aircraft direct-
ly using atomic energy of the type we
know today," he predicted. He said that
chemical fuels must supply our ever-
increasing needs for fast, efficient trans-
portation.
In the field of heating, he went on,
atomic energy may be used directly in
some specialized processes.
"But in the end," Mr. McCune declar-
ed, "electricity will take over the main
heating load."
In surveying the prospects for competi-
tive atom-produced electricity, the G-E
executive said that dual-market nuclear
power plants would be used first. These,
he said, not only would provide heat for
the production of electric power, but
would produce useful fissionable material.
"These may be started," he said, "as
soon as the legal and procedural road
blocks are out of the way. The main load,
however, must in the end be carried by-
installations whose main, if not single
purpose, is the production of electricity."
Intensive studies by G-E engineers have
emphasized that "possibly five years, and
certainly ten, will find us generating eco-
nomic electric power from atomic en-
ergy," he stressed.
Mr. McCune said that the technical
problems confronting industry in this
undertaking are difficult "but of the order
of magnitude that we believe are clearly
compatible with the magnitude of effort
now attacking them."
He said that the supply of uranium
should not prove a great problem since it
is believed that "much more uranium
will be found than can now be predicted."
"This being so," he continued, "fuel
costs in a practical reactor can be nearly
zero. I believe that in the five to ten-year
period I mentioned that these costs are
likely to be competitive with chemical
fuel at 12 cents per million BTU's (Brit-
ish thermal units).
"The over-all cost assessed to the fuel,
due to increased capital investment and
operating cost does, however, leave the
station (power plant) competitive with a
conventional station using 35 cents-per-

million-BTU fuel. This is without con-
sidering or placing any value on the by-
products of radiation—plutonium and
other isotopes produced—and I believe
that value will be found for all these."
In 20 years or more, he said, "I be-
lieve that we will see gas, oil and coal
start to assume what I think will be their
ultimate role: the raw materials of a great-
ly-expanded chemical industry. Mean-
while, we will continue to use our chemi-
cal fuels in ever increasing quantities.
"This I say with only one reservation,"
he added. "We must keep our country
strong and safe. We must continue to
respect and encourage free enterprise. If
we do these things—and who does not
believe we will?-—the producers of en-
ergy—coal, oil, gas, and nuclear—will
carry us together to an age of produc-
tivity as yet undreamed of."
Liquid Metal Pump
A new pump, designed to move liquid
metals within cooling or heating systems,
to force liquid metals into forms in die-
casting operations, and for general usage
wherever these metals must be forced
from point to point, has been introduced
by Gallery Chemical Company of Callery,
Pa.
The unique pump also is believed to
have applications in industrial atomic en-
ergy^operations.
Operated on an electromagnetic prin-
ciple, the new pump has no moving parts,
no packing glands.
Designed to pump liquid metals by
means of an electric current, the new
Callery alternating current, conduction
type EM Pump can be operated from
single phase, 60-cycle alternating current
voltages.
The pump operates on a basic electro-
magnetic principle. The liquid metal to be
pumped is, of course, a conductor of
electricity. When an electrical current is
passed through the metal, in a direction
perpendicular to a magnetic field which
surrounds the metal, it produces a force
which sets that metal in motion within

the pumping section. A pump of this type
will effectively pump those fluid metals
which have a lower electrical resistance
than that of the pumping section's walls.
Mechanically, the pump is constructed
with two current transformers, connected
additively. These supply the current to an
armature which is brazed to the tubular
pumping section of the device at flattened
portions of the tube. Current path
through the armature is continuous across
one flattened portion of the pumping
tube, through the other side of the arma-
ture and across the tube's other flattened
section.

flight testing jet engines, is shown
aboard a North American B-45 bomber
which is used as a "flying test bed" by
the General Electric Company's Flight
Test Laboratory near Schenectady, N.Y.
Allen Bell, Laboratory engineer ad-
justs the instrument.
The periscope, located in the nose of
the bomber, a position usually occupied
by the navigator-bombardier, brings
the fifth test engine which is extended
from the bomb bay into full view of the
engineer for observation. Without the
use of the periscope he would be unable
to see it since the test engine is located
below and behind his position.
(Continued from page 50)
The magnetic field is produced for four
coils placed one on each of the legs of
two U-shaped laminated magnetic field
cores. These cores are attached to the de-
vice so that the ends of the U-shaped
cores are against the flattened part of the
pump tube, perpendicular to the direc-
tion of the armature. The coils on the
cores are connected to supply the re-
quired flux in the proper direction.
Flow rates of the new Callery conduc-
tion-type EM Pumps are positively con-
trolled from zero to maximum flow by an
adjustable autotransformer.
Since this pump is symmetrical, the di-
rection of flow of the liquid metal being
pumped may be reversed by reversing the
direction of the magnetic field with re-
spect to the direction of the current
through the pumping section. It is pos-
sible to do this even with the pump in
operation.
Conduction type EM pumps may be
used to move any liquid metal which will
wet the pumping section and which has a
high conductivity. The pumps are nor-
mally tested at 1000° Fahrenheit, with
sodium potassium alloy.
Installation of the Callery EM Pump is
simple. It can be installed in a hermeti-
cally sealed loop, or in an open system.
It can be welded or flanged into any sys-
tem, according to specific needs. All
pumps are equipped with welding con-
nections; flanges or threads can be added
as desired.

nating current, conduction type Electro-
magnetic Pump are described in Bulletin

New Speedometer
A new disc type speedometer, known as
the "Safety Arc," which indicates speed
by a continuous curved red line, is now in
production at AC Spark Plug Division of
General Motors, Joseph A. Anderson,
general manager, announced October 27.
Pontiac will use the new type on all
1955 models.
"Besides being unusually attractive, the
new speedometer design has a decided
safety feature," Anderson pointed out.
"While the speedometer is compact,
speed is clearly indicated by a bold red
line on a semi-circular dial. The continu-
ous red line flows from left to right across
the speed markings as the car accelerates.

"The brilliance of the line, both day
and night, gives the driver two quick in-
dications of his speed. First he notes the
speed as indicated by the figures at the
end of the red line. Second, the length of
the line itself is an automatic indication
of speed.
"Research and experimentation has
proven that the bright red 'flowing' line
is the most impressive way yet discovered
of indicating car speed. Since the speed
line lengthens with the increase of cax
speed, its length tends to make a driver
more speed conscious at all times," An-
derson explained.
The total mileage meter is located away
from the "speed line" for clear reading
of both speed and mileage.

speedometer are directional signal indica-
tors and bright light beam indicators.

inate any chance of speedometer noise or

viewed the work to be done with an imagineering eye. But
they were much more than that. They were pioneers . ..
leaders . . . men of vision.
A lot has happened since 1888. The country ... the
company . . . and the industry have grown up. Ten new
territories have become states, for one thing. The total
industry now employs more than 1,000,000 people—
and the little outfit on Smallman Street? Well, it's a lot
bigger, too—and the name has been changed to Alcoa.
Aluminum Company of America . . . but it's still the
leader—still the place for engineering "firsts".
As you prepare to trade textbooks for a position in
industry, consider the advantages of joining a
dynamic company like Alcoa—for real job stability
and pleasant working conditions—where good
men move up fast through their association with
the recognized leaders in the aluminum industry.
We have fine positions for college graduate

industry in the next ten years in the form
of new engineering construction.
Magnitude of Investment
I would like to leave that one thought
with you in statistical terms, because you
want to know what this field of invest-
ment is, what its magnitude and share of
the economy is. I think that, although it
is a simple calculation, it can be varied
widely, and we can increase it a great
deal more, depending on what estimated
increase value we place on an additional
kilowatt-hour of capacity for an atomic-
power plant. Estimates show that this
value could vary from $250 to $850,
compared with $200 for conventional
power.
Thus, this is a large industry we are
talking about. The interesting thing is
that there is not a single commercial
atomic plant in existence today, but there
are many government power reactors. It
was at the University of Chicago in De-
ATOMICjENERGY
(Continuid from page 15)
cember of 1942 that the first reactor was
built. That was not a power device in the
real sense. It did not light lights or turn
motors, but rather demonstrated the prin-
ciple.
At the Argonne National Laboratory,
in Chicago, there is more concentrated
work being done in this field on reactors
than in any other area. It is interesting
that every atomic engineer's work centers
around power reactors. And I am happy
to report that, in the true American
fashion, hardly any two of them agree.
The result, therefore, is that there are
many choices to be made as to types
from which to select.
Many Types of Reactors
In approaching the use of these power
reactors, many varieties can be listed. For
instance, there are so-called homogeneous
reactors and heterogeneous reactors; there
are thermal reactors and high-energy re-
actors; there are breeder reactors and non-
breeder reactors; there are reactors that

use uranium and reactors that use pluto-
nium. Many other variations can be sug-
gested to you, and many are under design
and contemplated for construction. In ad-
dition, there are innumerable studies as
to other approaches. You will find that
there are today in the United States a
great many active study teams trying to
find the ideal reactor. We can tell you
that each one believes thoroughly in its
particular choice of approach to this prob-
lem. Similarly the amount of investment
involved varies widely.
7/ is interesting to note the A.E.C/s
five-year program for power reactor de-
velopment which was announced last
March. Six different types of reactors are
indicated (see Table 1) and they are list-
ed in the order in which they are rated
by 17 selected scientists, although agree-
ment on their comparative value is not
unanimous or even general. (3)

is like a coal furnace from which, after
you have burned your coal and shaken
your grate, and raked out your ashpit,
you have pulled out more coal than you
originally put in. It is called a breeder
because it breeds more fuel than the orig-
inal fuel allotment.
This is not magic or perpetual motion;
the process merely converts non-fission-
able materials into fisionable materials.
In other words, in the natural material
there is a very small amount of fission-
able material suitable for power reactors.
That is familiarly known as uranium
235. There are other materials which are
subject to conversion into potential fis-
sionable materials, such as uranium 238,
an isotope.
Therefore, a breeder reactor uses the
activity of the U235 and its surplus neu-
trons for converting the natural U238
isotope into plutonium 239 which like
U235 is a potential atomic fuel. The nat-
ural U238 by itself does not have atomic-
power capacity in reactors.
Why is this important to you? It is
particularly important because such re-
actors are more advanced, more difficult
to engineer, and take a larger investment.
What Is the Return?
Then you want to know, what is the
return? The return is a little complicated
due to one important fact. We have in
this country the Atomic Energy Commis-
sion, that giant monopoly which calls the
turn or tune, and as of today has placed
no price upon these secondarily produced
fuels that I am talking about. You can-
not find out what they are worth. So, if
you are starting today to design your pet
power project and you choose a breeder
type, you don't know what the market
for your fuel is going to be, and yet you
have to make an extra investment to ac-
complish it. This will no doubt shortly be
resolved by the Commission.
As all such atomic furnaces operate,
they generate new material called fission
fragments. To the expert they can be
classed as poison materials; poison ma-
terials because they slow down the reac-
tion. Therefore, you have to get rid of
them from time to time. Interestingly
enough, the solution of this problem is
a chemical and physical phenomenon and
is not otherwise closely allied to the pro-
duction of kilowatts. This is one of the
jokers in this field because it is an expen-
sive process to extract these fission frag-
ments as the art is today. It is expensive
for a variety of reasons.
Fission Products
These fission products frequently repre-
sent little-known chemical elements. Some
of them potentially are extremely valuable
in terms of price per pound. The materials
have to be cautiously dealt with because
the majority are extremely radioactive and
frequently poisonous as well. The work,
therefore, has to be done by remote con-
trol and not as normally carried out in
everyday chemical practice. This is a
highly specialized field. In fact, it is a
new art and it is going to play an ex-
ceedingly important part in the economics
of atomic-power plants.
Summarizing, it is an expensive process
but the end products may have excellent
value when their uses are better known.
Many New Problems
I would like to leave with you a few
of these extremely startling new problems
so that, when you talk with a so-called
expert in this field, you will not be mis-
led by an air of simplicity. I have found
a new law, which I will call for the mo-
ment "Ward's law": It runs something
like this: "The simplicity of a program,
such as that of building an atomic-power
plant, varies inversely with the knowl-
edge of the proponents thereof."
But the reason atomic power is so ap-
pealing is the fact that one pound of
any material, if wholly converted into
power, would yield over 11 billion kilo-
watt-hours of power. One pound of coal
yields one kilowatt-hour. Since only one
one-thousandths of a pound of uranium
actually develops power in the fission proc-
ess, therefore you can say a pound of
uranium fission will yield 11 million kilo-
watt-hours in the form of heat. Now, you
have to turn it into electric energy. Divide
it, roughly, into one-quarter for engineer-
ing cycle efficiency, and you come out,
say, with 3 million kilowatts, or three-
million-to-one in terms of coal fuel or
oil fuel, or if you prefer, gas fuel. So
you see in a fuel sense, an atomic power
plant is completely different from any-
thing you have become accustomed to
thinking of. Perhaps John L. Lewis will
not like it.
Uses of Reactors
As to power reactors, there are various
types in point of use. For instance,
there is the mobile reactor, there is the
package type of atomic power plant, and
there is the large reactor and power plant.
An example of a mobile reactor is an
atomic-propelled locomotive, or airplane
or ship. All of these have been shown to
be feasible, and, as you well know, the

submarine, or ship reactor, has been con-
structed and the ship has been launched.
The package reactor we will discuss
later, but it is conceived to be a complete
atomic-power plant which can be put to-
gether and moved like a package, as the
need arises.
The third type is the one that we have
been discussing and is essentially a large
power-station installation. All of these are
feasible and there are proponents of each
type ready and desirous of going to work.
I have to point out that, because of the
monopoly within the government, none
of these things can be accomplished with-
out a mandate from the Atomic Energy
Commission.
At this point, it is interesting to note
that such things as aircraft reactors have
peculiar properties. It can be shown that
a nuclear airplane has the ability to circle
the world continuously as long as the
coffee and sandwiches hold out for the
crew. In other words, there is no normal
refueling problem. This applies to the
ship as well. It is also true that such re-
actors will turn out more power when
needed than could be expected from con-
ventional commercially fueled power
units.
Thus on submarines you can get a
higher energy rate than with a chemical
fuel and therefore you can increase per-
formance as well as range.
Nuclear Energy for Aircraft
Since I had the honor of instituting and
carrying forward, from 1946 to 1949, the
nuclear propelled aircraft project, called
NEPA, I would like to point out that this
concept was brought into being as the
most efficient method and, therefore, the
safest method for delivering atomic
bombs over long distances. A nuclear-
propelled airplane is the only practical
way of getting a bomber which will go
faster than the interceptor which would
be used for attacking it. This is because
the interceptor will, no doubt, be power-
ed only with chemical fuel which has
limitations of power output and range.
When introduced, this idea was consider-
ed to be somewhat fantastic but is now
widely accepted throughout the United
States and in England. I do not know the
Russian plans in this situation. At any
rate, it is most difficult of all of the pro-
jected power applications that have been
touched upon.
Britain Is Ahead of Us
Now, lest you feel unduly proud of be-
ing an American, I want to say that Great
Britain is a year ahead of us in the field
of the use of atomic energy for public
power. Her first power plant will be
done, it is expected, at least a full year
before the Westinghouse-Duquesne plant.
And now we have the recent announce-
ment that Rjdssia claims the first such
plant. They claim an approximately 5,000
kilowatt plant which they say went on
the line in June of this year (3).
The first British plant will be followed
by another British plant of larger and
more advanced design to be built in the
northern part of Scotland. This, in turn,
will anticipate our competitive design by
a full year or more. So we are trailing
England today in that particular field. Of
course, we have put so much of our atten-
tion on weapons and on national security
that we have not been able to make the
same real progress in this otherwise un-
classified field for the future.
This has led us into some strange diplo-
matic problems, such as the pressure by
Belgium which has felt that we should
teach her to utilize atomic power since
she furnishes us with raw materials. The
Atomic Energy Act has prevented us from
doing so and, therefore, it has been said
that Europe has come to believe, in many
cases, that we are interested only in mili-
tary applications. Under these conditions,
Russia is reported to have stepped in
and offered to build and teach Belgium
how to build and operate such power
plants and in return have the latter's
uranium sent to Russia instead of the
United States. This caused some reaction
in Washington and many believe that this
is the reason for quick action on the
Westinghouse-Duquesne power project,
to show that America is interested and
will proceed with the peaceful uses of
atomic power.
That may be oversimplified but they
can be assumed to be the causes and ef-
fects. We do get uranium in the United
States from different countries. And all
of those areas are in need of power plants
more than we are. Their fuel costs are
higher. Therefore, the economics are
more favorable for them. For instance, in
the Congo, where our large supply of
uranium comes from, there is an urgent
need for power plants because there is so
little transportation in the modern sense.
Here it is that an atomic power plant is
necessary, very necessary.

called "the package reactor." This would

semble on a flatcar and use for civilian
defense or other emergencies. Thus if a
city were bombed out, you would have a
quick means of putting power into an
area to operate the essential services, such
as water supply systems, communications,
hospitals and the like.
Furthermore, up in the north of Green-
land we have air bases, and those bases
have to be serviced with fuel in harbors
that are open only two months of a year.
The fuel costs are prodigious, we are
told. We are told that oil costs $20 a
barrel delivered in Greenland. Thus this
becomes urgent on our list because it is
one of our most northern and most stra-
tegic defense boundaries. Therefore, we
need reliable power and fuel supply and
a packaged atomic reactor would solve
that.
There is in the United States Army a
group now set up and devoted toward
bringing into being such packaged re-
actors. I could read you their specifica-
tions just in the simplest form: Such a
reactor requires approximately 1,000-kilo-
watt capacity; it must operate five years
without refueling; it is transportable,
piece by piece, by aircraft; when as-
sembled it is less than the size of a
Quonset hut; the cost of the first unit is
estimated at $2y2 million to $3 million,
and its initial fuel loading—courtesy of
Uncle Sam—will be approximately $1
million.
You will be interested to know that
there are twenty American groups of com-
panies that are urgently setting out to
get the assignment to engineer such a
power plant.
Commercial Prospects
In the commercial reactor field there
are over 60 teams of large American com-
panies that have rolled up their sleeves
and gone to work and are trying now to
determine the engineering and scientific
aspects of their preferred approach to-
ward such atomic-power plants. They
are restricted by the present law, and
so their first order of business is to
rewrite the famous McMahon Act.
My own company, Vitro Corporation
of America, happens to be a member of
the Detroit Edison-Dow Chemical team;
that group of 26 companies is putting up
32,600,000 of their hard money this year
for experimental and developmental work

to arrange to do something which the law
now forbids, but which is done with the
full compliance of the AEC
Atomic reactors will not operate effi-
ciently at low temperatures. Most mater-
ials go to pieces at high temperatures.
Such materials also develop defects under
atomic bombardment inside a reactor.
Thus when certain materials are placed
in an atomic reactor and subjected to a
barrage of neutrons, the material under-
goes some unfavorable changes in its
physical properties. Sometimes it warps
and gets badly out of shape or loses its
properties as far as strength and elasticity
are concerned. These are in addition to
the dangerous temperature effects. This
means to the metallurgist that we have to
find new materials. Some of these new
materials exist in profusion as natural
minerals.
Zirconium and Other Metals
An example would be zirconium which
is found in the earth's crust more plenti-
fully than are copper, lead, tin or zinc.
Thus, it is not a rare material, but so far
no metallurgy or chemistry has pro-
duced it at prices much below $20 a
pound. Even at these figures it is so neces-
sary that it has to be used by the AEC
in the construction of many of its re-
actor systems. However, if this metal, for
instance, were to be exploited commer-
cially, at a reduced cost, it would enjoy a
wide market and would bring in a new in-
dustry. This is only a typical example of
what the Atomic Age will bring about.
So if you tend to oversimplify your
thinking of the atomic age you are
making a profound mistake, because along
with these developments which are point-
ed up in the daily news there is an army
of restricted developments, all of which
will provide opportunities for invest-
ments. I said "investments," although in
some cases with which I have recently be-
come familiar it seems to be more specu-
lation than investment.
I would also like to give you a few fig-
ures which I quote from an official report
(4) which concerns studies by Common-
wealth Edison; Dow Chemical and De-
troit Edison; Pacific Gas &amp; Electric and
Bechtel Corporation; Monsanto Chemical
and Union Electric. They report figures
for eight atomic power plants, all of
which can be built theoretically and all
of which will produce suitable power.
Reactor Examples
The first plant suggested—and I am
not going to define its technical opera-
tions—would cost $850 a kilowatt of
capacity, or about four and a quarter
times the cost of the present-day modern
steam plant. The next one, $560. And the
third $297.
Therefore if someone should ask you
about how much atomic power plants
would cost to build, here are the figures:
$297 to $850 per kilowatt of capacity.
But you have to know what kind of plants
they are and what they do, and whether
or not they breed fuel.
What are the sizes of these power
plants?
The gross capacity of these plants are
respectively 46,000 kilowatts for the first,
211,000 kilowatts for the second and
246,900 kilowatts for the third.
Taking two other studies of 100,000
and 145,000 kilowatt capacity, the prices
were $405 and $350 per kilowatt hour,
respectively. Taking three other studies,
for a 210,000 kilowatt plant, a 554,000
kilowatt plant, and a 125,000 kilowatt
plant, corresponding estimated costs were
$476, $282 and $480. Actually their de-
signs were all different.
Foreign Countries
I would like to close with consideration
of what is being done in foreign coun-
tries. There arc, to the best of my knowl-
edge, thirteen foreign countries engaged
in building reactors. Therefore do not
think of this as being an American mon-
opoly either in science, practice or other-
wise. In both the engineering and science
phases there arc some very brilliant people-
abroad. I do not think, if I were you,
that I would believe the Russians can't
build such plants if the Kremlin desires.
It is my sincere belief that America can
meet the challenge of the Atomic Age
with all its implications.

Russia Builds Up Supply of Engineers
American supremacy in science and
technology is seriously threatened by a
rapid build-up in the supply of engineers
in Russia, Dr. John T. Rettaliata, presi-
dent of Illinois Institute of Technology,
warned October 27.
Dr. Rettaliata pointed out the threat to
200 iron and steel industry operating exe-
cutives at a Chicago regional meeting of
the American Iron and Steel Institute in
the South Shore Country club.
He said that while this country has
some 500,000 engineers and 200,000 sci-
entists, compared with Russia's estimated
400,000 and 150,000, the Soviet Union
has been expanding training in these
fields more rapidly than the United
States.
"From 1951 to 1954," Dr. Rettaliata
stated, "the number of Russian engineer-
ing graduates totaled 154,000, compared
with our 116,000 for the same years—an
average of 38,500 a year, against our
29,000."
He estimated that United States indus-
try currently needs some 30,000 new engi-
neers annually for replacement and to
fill new jobs. However, only a part of
each year"s engineering graduates are
available because of commitments to the
ROTC program, he added.
The Illinois Tech president pointed out
that the Rusian engineering student is
given more intensive training in his par-
ticular technical field than his American
counterpart.
In Russia, the program is of five and
one-half years' duration," Dr. Rettaliata
explained. "Also, most of the program
is at the expense of the humanities, de-
voted to narrow specialization. In major
subject matter, the education is equiva-
lent to beyond the master's degree level
here.
"In the United States, the objective
is to prepare the scientist and engineer for
civic as well as profesional responsibili-
ties. More of the humanities and liberal
studies are included to produce students
better able to cope with complex problems
prevalent in society today."

Because of military emphasis this is the most
rapidly growing and promising sphere of endeavor for the young
electrical engineer or physicist.
Since 1948 Hughes Research and Devel-
opment Laboratories have been engaged
in an expanding program for design, de-
velopment and manufacture of highly
complex radar fire control systems for
fighter and interceptor aircraft. This re-
quires Hughes technical advisors in the
field to serve companies and military
agencies employing the equipment.
As one of these field engineers you will
become familiar with the entire systems in-
volved, including the most advanced
electronic computers. With this advan-
tage you will be ideally situated to
broaden your experience and learning
more quickly for future application to
advanced electronics activity in either the
military or the commercial field.

ENGINEERS
When Commencement is over, engi-
neering graduates report for duty with a
new employer with very little real under-
standing of what opportunities are open
to them, what will be required of them
and how they will have to behave in order
to succeed in accordance with their ambi-
tions. Too much is left to chance and
circumstance. In most cases, a man has
incurred obligations and responsibilities
of a rather serious sort by the time he
wakes up to the facts and is no longer
very free to exercise discretion in choos-
ing a path of personal development. Al-
most all engineering graduates work for
a salary in commercial, industrial or gov-
ernment organizations. It is with this
group that I shall deal in the remarks
which follow and more particularly with
the segment that works in industry.
Most of us never are entirely free, all
our lives, to make just those choices that
might suit us best at the time. We have
to compromise all through life and since
this is so, it is good to learn how to com-
promise constructively. The important
thing, it seems to me, is to compromise
consciously and in the light of the facts
rather than blindly, being pushed around
by circumstances. In the case of engineer-
ing graduates this is especially important
for the fact is that there is infinite variety
in the kinds of opportunity open to men
trained in the engineering discipline. In
our very complex American economy,
technical aspects have become so impor-
tant that men with engineering training
have invaded every area of corporate ac-
tivity and have reached every echelon of
corporate management, including the very
top.
How should a young man go about
By W. T. NICHOLS
the job of succeeding? This brings up, at
once, the question—What is success? To
different people it means different things.
I have pointed out at some length, else-
where, (1) that it is of paramount im-
portance to know what you want out of
life. Your idea of success may eventually
mean more prestige than money, more
comfort than position. Usually, a young
man just embarking on a career thinks
of success in terms of progress in his pro-
fession, advancement in a business or-
ganization, gaining a good reputation and
the respect and admiration of his fellows.
One of the most articulate engineers of
all time was the late William E. Wicken-
den. Some of his writings have been col-
lected under the title "A Professional
Guide for Junior Engineers" (2). These
make fascinating reading for men just
about to embark oo a career. Says Dr.
Wickenden, "—the young engineer must
have as he enters upon his career, and
certainly must develop consciously and
progressively as he pursues his career,
some very specific qualities. Some of
these qualities are quite homely, some are
quite rigorous. They include: Courage and
integrity, a strong purpose and determina-
tion, a thirst for knowledge, imagination,
sound judgment, accuracy of thought, in-
stinct for economy, the habit of thinking
back from effect to cause, aptitude for
leadership, ingeniousness, and capacity
for hard work." As he discusses these
qualities more fully it becomes very ap-
parent that success by any definition is
not really a matter of luck, though chance
may sometimes be quite influential. Good
management of your career is certainly
a safer bet.
Engineering is an art and therefore
must be learned by practice. A neophyt
Bachelor of Science in Engineering is no
an engineer, may his grades be ever *
high. Actually, comparatively few engi
neering graduates spend their careers ii
professional engineering. Large number
of graduates start out in assignment
where there is little chance to learn th
engineering art but where engineeria
training is useful and necessary. A grei
many such jobs are in production supti
vision and sales and there are many fin
opportunities for men well adapted t
these sorts of activities. For those rra&gt;
interested in the theoretical aspects o
engineering, all kinds of splendid n
search opportunities are available. Wher
a man has strong leanings toward the if
plication of theory to practice, enginsx-
ing groups of several kinds offer all mar.
ner of chances to learn and practice th
art of engineering. For those who f«
deeply that they wish to learn the u
of engineering, even though they may no
expect to make a lifelong career in pro
fessional engineering, it is obviousl
wrong to start out in an assignment sue:
that engineering knowledge quickly slip
away and is forgotten.
It is important to realize that no on
else is going to do your thinking for yot
Your new employer knows no more aba.
you than you know about him. He hi
probably classified you on the basis of
relatively brief interview. If he needs
man for production supervision or silt
or research or engineering and you sea
to fit, you may get the job, but such 1
assignment may not lead you in the c
rection you want to go. While an en

Mr. Nichols is a native of Pittsburgh, attended the public
schools of that city and was graduated from the University of
Pittsburgh in 1922. He joined the research staff of Mellon
Institute after his graduation and remained there until 1926
when he became research engineer for Columbian Rope
Company at its Carteret, New Jersey, plant as a research engi-
neer, and in 1935, he was made Director of Research and De-
velopment of the company and stationed at South Charleston,
West Virginia. In 1943 he moved to New York as technical
assistant to the executive vice president. Later, he was director
of technical sales and then embarked on a series of develop-

primary responsibility for your progress
will always be yours. If you wind up as
a routine draftsman or a clerk when you
could have handled much greater respon-
sibilities, the blame cannot be placed on
your employers. Even in big companies
that have elaborate personnel organiza-
tions and plentiful training programs, the
burden is on the man himself to find his
kind of success and right path to his
chosen goal.
Job satisfaction is important. No one
can be truly happy or even fairly effective
unless his job gives real satisfaction.
There are two primary approaches. One is
to find a worthwhile course of develop-
ment that fits your characteristics. The
other is to alter your characteristics to fit
some worthwhile course of development.
In most cases, some of each is required.
Early training and family environment are
influential factors in determining personal
characteristics, a boy brought up under
certain circumstances may largely lack the
ability to maintain warm personal rela-
tions with other people. Such a person
might be most comfortable, if left to his
own devices, if he works at a job in which
he has little or no contact with others and
in which he can succeed without the co-
operation of others. It is important to
realize that, increasingly, technical work
involves team work. "Lone-wolf" as-
signments are rare. This means that, in-
creasingly, engineers must develop skill
in human relations.
There are people who are happiest and
most satisfied when they have technical
responsibility and authority, rather than
supervisory responsibility and authority.
Such a person might by choice or by ac-
cident devote his career to a relatively
narrow field of engineering activity. For
example, a man might become a top
authority on a subject such as steam
boilers or steam turbines or switch gear or
underground water resources or fractional
distillation or mine safety or soil struc-
ture or corrosion. It is not difficult to
imagine the intense satisfaction and
sense of accomplishment which a certain
type of mind would derive from such
high attainment. Great technical author-
it)' can be wielded by these technical ex-
perts and great technical responsibility
assumed. Many men enjoy such a life al-
most without regard to the income as-
pects or organization position, as our
economy increases in technical complexity,
the more progressive companies are re-
alizing how very valuable great technical
expertness is and are much more inclined
than they once were to reward it in terms
of both money and organization stature.
Thus, a young engineering graduate
might well consider the advantages of this
path of development. It is not easy to
get started on such a career. Few men
just out of school have any strong devo-
tion to a relatively narrow field of engi-
neering. They are much more likely to be
curious about all phases and their even-
tual preference is stronly influenced by
early experiences that are largely un-
planned and uncontrolled. Opportunities
to specialize generally come along later, if
at all. There does seem to be a tendency
for employers to work a man into a
specialized field if the employee is tech-
nically competent and at the same time
not strongly inclined toward managing
the activities of others. As in many phases
of business life, natural processes some-
times bring about happy arrangements but
too much is usually left to accident.
At the other end of the scale is the
kind of person whose tastes and inter-
ests are catholic and who takes readily to
the task of managing people and projects.
Men who have real talent along these
lines are eagerly sought by employers
since the need is so great and because the
financial consequences of good or inept
management are so immediately and so
strikingly apparent. It seems to be the
case that only a very few men have well-
developed management abilities in their
early years and comparatively few ever
develop these abilities of their own ac-
cord. There is great and radiply increas-
ing interest on the part of employers in
methods for developing management
talent. Generally speaking, the men who
have been successful in the management
line have attained very much higher re-
muneration and organization stature than
those who have developed only along
technical lines.
The great majority of engineering
graduates have grown up in environments
that produce neither the man strongly
oriented toward lone-wolf, highly tech-
nical activity nor the born manager. Most
engineering graduates fall in-between the
extremes. A great deal depends upon how
soon a man works under someone capable
of developing his abilities and correcting
his faults. Employers are showing evi-
dence of much improved understanding
and handling of these matters and oppor-
tunities for planned, on-the-job develop-
ments of men to meet industry's needs
are increasing rapidly for engineering
graduates as for others.
While there is room for more and bet-
ter engineering technical experts and al-
ways a great demand for engineering-
trained management experts, the great
majority of engineering graduates must
find their careers in the area between these
extremes. The reasons for any particular
individual spending his working career
exactly as he happens to do are pretty
complex. Almost all men are naturally
indolent. Only the exceptional men are
willing to work really hard without any
special prodding from outside. Conse-
quently, it is easy to stand out from the
great mass of employees if you are less
indolent than the average. If you have
average ability and work really hard, you
can progress rapidly. A question of habit,
rather than any deep-seated aversion from
work, is involved. Any young engineering
graduate who puts work ahead of every-
thing else will mcve along much faster
than those who do not. Social pressures
are against this. Generally, it is much like
school-days. The devoted student some-
times fears ridicule. The fact is that there
is a kind of enjoyment to be had from
intensive application to your work that
must be experienced to be appreciated. It
beats athletics or spectator sports or pure-
ly social events, although these are fine
in their place. The rank assigned to work
will usually determine your fate more
than any other single decision. Distrac-
tions are plentiful in the form of recrea-
tional activities, attractive young ladies
and the like. While these have their own
importance in the scheme of things, im-
proper emphasis may prevent or fatally
delay advancement opportunities.
Comprehensive knowledge of engineer-
ing theory is a tremendous advantage and
forms a firm foundation on which to
build. Hard work leads to success and
enjoyment. Identifying your goals and
consciously working toward them is the
best prescription for a happy life.

WHAT MAKES
PRODUCT DESIGNS
SUCCESSFUL
ONLY when a product can be manu-
factured and sold at a profit is it
considered successful by industry. To
meet competition today, the product must
be built at lowest possible cost.
The engineer who can create economi-
cal designs finds rewarding demands for
his talents by manufacturers everywhere.
To achieve low costs, manufacturers
are turning to welded steel construction
on many of their products. Material costs
less and fewer pounds of metal are need-
ed to do the same job as with iron. Man-
ufacture is simpler with welding . . .
takes fewer shop hours to effect cost sav-
ings up to 50% on most designs.

whole, elects members of its governing
body. For instance, at the start of this
semester, the freshman class elected its
representatives from a slate of twenty-
nine candidates. Already the freshman
class is planning activities which will
benefit the entire class, not just a small
percentage of students. Likewise, the
seniors elect their class officers to repre-
sent their class. Thus, class organization
completely represents the students, and
activities are planned for all students.
The sophomore class has been organ-
ized and organization of the junior class
has been discussed. These class orgniza-
tions are seeking to insure representation
for the entire student body of the col-
lege. The class organization affords a more
direct method of representation to the
students. Moreover, it does not seem too
far-fetched to say that there could be
sophomore, junior, and senior assem-
blies as well as freshman assemblies.
Thus, the students could coordinate their
class organizations more efficiently and
accomplish more work.
Besides obtaining complete representa-
tion, the class organization produces bet-
ter spirit and loyalty for the engineering
college. The class organization exists for
the class members, whose loyalty is di-
rected toward the class and, together with
the other classes, toward the college as a
whole. Moreover, decisions affecting the
members of an organized representative
group are made for the benefit of the
group. Thus, a unified class spirit is en-
couraged to a large extent by the partici-
pation of all members of the group. In
addition, class functions develop a sin-
cere and binding relationship between
the college and the students. This, in turn,
encourages a more unified spirit toward
the college.
In conclusion, these points seem evi-
dent: Class organization gives complete
representation, while lack of participation
is rampant in departmental societies. Class
organization encourages a college-wide
spirit rather than a narrow, independent,
departmental spirit. Finally, the class or-
ganization exists for the benefit of the
student body, not for a limited percentage
of students.
The issue of class organization versus
department organization must be decided
by you, the engineering students. Do you
want a departmental organization, which
represents only 31.35% of the students?
Or do you want a class organization,
which works toward the purpose of rep-
resenting all students in the functions of
the college?
Figures used were from the following
sources:
1. Office of Student Affairs, University
of Michigan.
2. Recording Secretary's Office, College
of Engineering, University of Michigan.
Rebuttal
In his argument above, Brian has very
effectively pointed out the lack of student
participation in college activities and is
quite justified in emphasizing the need
for more adequate representation of the
student body.
However, several facts have been over-
looked which shed a slightly different
light on the picture:
1. The Freshman Class is organized
and is represented in student government
because freshmen are not eligible to join
the professional societies. The freshmen
represent 30% of the total number of
engineers in the college and are not ac-
counted for in the above figures.
2. The sophomore, juniors, and senior
classes do not have weekly assemblies as
do the freshmen. This is a definite hin-
drance to class organization; representa-
tives once elected would tend to lose
touch with their constituents pretty
rapidly.
3- Participation in departmental so-
cieties is not low because the societies
have failed to make themselves attractive;
the main factor holding down member-
ship is the relatively small percentage of
engineers interested in promoting any
organizations activities. This has been and
is the biggest stumbling block in represen-
tative student government. Changing the
system of representation would not change
this.
All in all I think this last point is most
important. As things are now a student
must exercise a little initiative if he wants
to be represented. I can't help but think
this is all for the good.

(Continued from page 19)
organizing student government, and either solution is better
than attempting to work with both systems at once as is
now being done.
The "class unity" concept is a valuable goal; engineers
should broaden their knowledge of other departments and
karn what other engineers are doing and how they are do-
ing it. This cannot help but be good for them. It is only when
the "unified class" approach enters the area of student govern-
ment that it begins treading on shaky ground. Let's organize
technical programs and attract speakers of interest to all engi-
neers—unity can be promoted this way; but let's leave "class
unity" out of student government—it works best this way.
Rebuttal
My opponent has stated that the Sophomore Board has no
useful purpose. This is not true. The purpose of the Board is
to give each member of the Sophomore class complete and
direct representation in engineering activities and policies,
thereby unifying the class. The Board will also strengthen
student government, for student government is the basis of a
dass unity. The Sophomore Board does not disrupt the system
of the Engineering Council, but materially adds the needed
representation of the many sophomore students, not represent-
ed in actual practice by the Engineering Council.
It has been stated that SL is planning to use a system simi-
lar to that of the Engineering Council. However, the prob-
lems of SL are very different from those of the College of
Engineering. Moreover, it does not follow that what is good
for SL is good for the Engineering Council, for SL's prob-
lems of representation of the entire campus are enormous and
diversified from those of the Engineering College.
Have the departmental organizations been working with
smoothness and ease, as stated. It is still too soon to judge, for
the Engineering Council has functioned for only 15 school
weeks. It cannot be assumed that this Council will meet the
needs of the students better by a departmental system, for it
has not been proved as a better system. The class organization
offers many more direct and apparent advantages rather than
the indirectness of the small groups, as set up by the engi-
neering Council.
Technical societies do have an integrated part in the Col-
lege of Engineering by broadening the knowledge of the stu-
dents in different fields. However, the technical society does
not belong in the major role as leader in student government,
for small "splinter" groups are not able to lead student gov-
ernment, as a class organizational set-up could. Student gov-
ernment implies government by the students themselves, and
not by small factions of the students. Moreover, class unity be-
longs to the- students. Therefore, the only way in which class
unity can be encouraged and produced is through the work
of the students, and this means through their government.
The class organization is the only method by which this can
be done, for it represents the entire student body and the means
to have good class unity.

ENGINEERING
It has long been known that theoreti-
cal developments lead eventually to new
practices in industry. This was impressed
on me in my college training. Experience
has strengthened this conviction.
Why eventually? Why not now? Why
should there so often be such a wide gap
between theoretical progress and its prac-
tical application?
Shortly after graduation I made a
number of suggestions to a stubborn prac-
tical engineer. Whether the suggestion
was good, bad, or indifferent, his com-
ment was always, "That's good in theory
but not in practice." So one day I replied,
"If something is really good in theory, it
is good in practice; if the theory is right,
practice is wrong; if practice is correct,
the theory is wrong. A theory that does
not improve practice is useless." He re-
plied, "Then these must be a lot of rot-
ten theories." There are indeed a lot of
incorrect or misleading theories. Even a
good theory can fail because of its im-
proper usage. A proper application can-
not be made unless the theory applies to
plant conditions and takes economic fac-
tors into consideration.
What are the pitfalls for application
of theory? Occasionally, a theory may be
entirely correct. More often it is not
sufficiently complete. The ideal conditions
for which it was derived may differ
considerably from plant conditions and
therefore not apply. Still more often good
theories are manhandled, i.e., improperly
used. I'll have more to say about these
later. First, let's talk about the most com-
mon pitfall of all.
By LOYAL CLARKE
Failure to fully consider costs has led
to countless disasters.
A classic example is the story of a tung
oil pressing plant bujlt in China back
in the "twenties." For centuries the Chin-
ese coolies had been pressing tung oil by
driving wedges into logs, putting seeds
into the split and then removing the
wedges. A young chemical engineer rea-
soned, correctly, that this was a poor
method of pressing—high labor and low
yield. So he built a modern hydraulic
pressing plant and went broke. His
power, maintenance, and capital cost far
exceeded the costs of Chinese coolie labor.
Yes, this was a freak condition, but
the same type of thing often happens in
our modern industry. The large Fischer-
Tropsh plant was recently shut down at
a loss of, perhaps, $75,000,000. Just a
few years ago another petro-chemical
plant failed and several millions of dol-
lars were lost.
What is efficiency? Any engineer can
define the mechanical efficiency of a
pump. Is a pump of the highest mechani-
cal efficiency the most efficient to install?
Probably not. The management is inter-
ested in the total cost of the operation.
This total cost includes operating labor,
maintenance, interest or borrowed capital.
Thus, in some instances a cheap pump
would be chosen. In others an expensive
pump would be chosen with special fea-
tures such as mechanical seals or corro-
sion-resistant alloys. In any event the
mechanical efficiency is only one of many
factors.
A practical plant criterion is "the most
for the least." This, in my opinion, is
equally sound in theory. Acceptance of
this philosophy means that power is
frequently sacrificed to lower capital costs
or to reduce maintenance. A particular
type of efficiency is sacrificed to save
money. What does this saving in money
represent? It means less steel, fabrication
labor and operating labor: it allows better
utilization of available capital. To put this
another way, the average efficiency in the
use of all our country's resources can be
improved by tempering the desire for
particular forms of efficiencies to improve
others. Cost factors, properly used, afford
a reasonable measure of the overall effi-
ciency.
A theory may be correct but not suffi-
ciently general to apply as we might wish.
When I went to college we were given
a formula for filtration rates, a useful
formula that gave satisfactory results for
most cases. The filtration of some solids
(such as those removed from vegetable
oils) completely ignored the theory.
Why? The formula was based on an in-
compressible cake but some solids form
compressible cakes. Since then, theory has
been extended to include allowance for
the missing factor.
Shortly after marriage I told my wife
not to boil the potatoes so fast. Since
water boils at 212°F the potatoes would
cook equally fast if boiled slowly. She
promptly demonstrated that potatoes cook
faster when boiled rapidly. Agitation by
rapid boiling improves the heat transfer.
It is common practice to design coolers
and heaters from theoretical calculations.
This acceptance is natural because the
calculated rate of heat transfer is nearly
always within a few per cent of that ob-
served for new equipment. After a limited
period of service, the rate may drop due
to solids forming deposits on the tubes,
shutting down an operation before the
scheduled shutdown period. This would
increase maintenance costs and upset the
general maintenance shop schedules. The
reduction of heat transfer by fouling is
not susceptible to theoretical treatment,
but empirical fouling factors have been
developed from experience and accepted
by theoretically minded people. Many

Loyal Clarke was born at Billings, Montana, in 1904. As a child he tinkered
with telegraphy and a chemistry set. The latter started his life long interest in chemi-
cal engineering.
Mr. Clarke graduated with a Ch.E. from Oregon State Agriculture College. He
then took a year's postgraduate work at the University of California.
His first job was with the Bureau of Mines working on methods for making
potash fertilizer from potash minerals occurring in the United States.
Five years later he returned to school at the California Institute of Technology.
During his sojourn there he was married.
After this he went back to work for the Bureau of Mines. His next employer
was Petroleum Chemicals, Inc. While working there he wrote a "Manual for Process
Engineering Calculations."
Following a year at the Celanese Corporation of America Loyal in 1946 joined
Day &amp; Zimmerman, Inc., where he is now engaged in designing chemical plants and
in advising customers as to costs and profit potential of new ventures.

Marquette University, BS—I94S
and now Supervisor of Plant Engineering,
Allis-Chalmers, Norwood, Ohio, Works
"X /fosT men graduating from college don't have a
XtJ. clear idea of what they want to do. These indi-
viduals are helped by Allis-Chalmers Graduate Train-
ing Course to find the right job whether it be in design,
sales, engineering, research or manufacturing.
"My case is a little different, however. I started the
course with all my interest centered on tool design and
'in-plant' service. The reason is that I started getting
vocational guidance from some very helpful Allis-
Chalmers men back in 1940."
Served Apprenticeship
"At their suggestion I had gone to school part time
while working full time. This not only gave me the
chance to serve an apprenticeship as a tool and die
maker, and earn money, but I learned what I wanted
to do after graduation.
"Then came the war and service in the Navy. After
the war I finished school. By the time I started on the
course in 1948, I knew what I liked and seemed best
fitted to do. As a result, my entire time as a GTC stu-
dent was spent in the shops.
"The 18 months spent in the foundry, erection floor
and machine shop have all proved valuable background
for my present job.
"As supervisor of plant engineering at the Norwood
Works, I am concerned with such problems as: Plant
layout, material handling equipment and methods, new
construction, new production methods to be used in
building motors, centrifugal pumps, and Texrope
drives. It's an extremely interesting job.
"From my experience, I'd say, whether you're a
freshman or a senior it will pay you to talk to an Allis-
Chalmers representative now. You can't start plan-
ning your future too soon. And you can't plan starting
at a better place, because Allis-Chalmers builds so many
different products that you'll find any type of engi-
neering activity you could possibly want right here."
Facta You Should Know About the ALLIS-CHALMERS Graduate Training Course
1. It's well established, having been
started in 1904. A large percentage of the
management group are graduates of the
course
2. The course offers a maximum of 24
months' training. Length and type of
training is individually planned.
3. The graduate engineer may choose the
kind of work he wants to do: design, en-
gineering, research, production, sales,
erection, service, etc.
4. He may choose the kind of power,
processing, specialized equipment or in-
dustrial apparatus with which he will
work, such as: steam or hydraulic, turbo-
generators, circuit breakers, unit substa-
tions, transformers, motors, control
pumps, kilns, coolers, rod and ball mills,
crushers, vibrating screens, rectifiers, in-
duction and dielectric heaters, grain mills,
sifters, etc.

such factors of safety arc used in equip-
ment design and specifications.
Thus before an application of theory is
attempted careful consideration of a num-
ber of factors should be made. Care
should be taken that the theory is ap-
plicable to the actual conditions. Proper
safety factors to cover any uncertainties
should be included. Finally, an overall
benefit for the ultimate objectives must be
shown. A better product at low cost is the
most common objective.
Modern industry is complex and it is
seldom that one person can evaluate all
the ramifications of even his own ideas.
Rather, a new idea is turned over to many
people. One should welcome this review
even though often the idea may receive
unfair treatment. More often, the review-
ers will reject the idea because it has dis-
advantages that were not at first evident.
It may be a good idea but just a little
short on economic advantges and there-
fore be sidetracked for more promising
developments.
Unfair treatment of new ideas is indeed
common—some people are downright
prejudiced against new ideas other than
(Continued from page 50)
their own. Others are too conservative
and very hesitant in approving new proj-
ects even after it has been demonstrated
that the project looks favorable and is a
good "calculated risk" for capital invest-
ment.
How can we combat this prejudice and
inertia? I think it is a hazard of our trade,
something that we must live with. At
least, we can do much to minimize it and
can make much progress, despite the in-
ertia, through patience and understanding.
Consider an engineer who has develop-
ed a new process and had the pleasure of
seeing it operate satisfactorily and make
money. Of this he should be proud. Un-
less he is unusually broad minded, this
pride may blind him to the possibilities
for improvement and to the weakness of
his past work. During the course of de-
velopment he probably tried many ideas
that failed. He knows that a new idea
represents a new gamble and unless the
expected benefits are very high indeed, he
may be slow to take the gamble. When
the plant is in trouble or a new process
is to be installed, then the same man will
show interest in new ideas. At those times
of dire need, the men with good ideas
have a good opportunity to secure the con-
fidence of the hard-bitten administrators.
At times like these a file of ideas is
valuable. Then, too, there are very few
so completely opposed to change as they
first appear. Indeed no one can maintain
a reputation by rejecting all progressive
ideas.
So, by a reasonable balance between
patience and impatience you, who are full
of new ideas, can look forward to seeing
many of them put into practice. You can
best promote an idea if you give careful
consideration to all competing theories,
practical aspects, and weak points before
advancing it and then listening eagerly to
the comments. Careful listening may per-
mit still further improvement. One who
suggests an improvement should be as
zealous in improving his own ideas as
he is in changing another's. Most of
all, keep plugging and don't allow any
kidder or vicious plant engineer to de-
stroy your initiative. All too often young
engineers are 'beat down" during their
training period. They too follow only
"the book" of standard practice and be-
come just the type that they had earlier
detested.
Sure I know that it is discouraging to
see good ideas shoved unceremoniously
into the waste basket, or to be told that
your idea had been rejected five years
earlier. So what? You have many years
ahead, and many, many more disappoint-
ments mixed with your achievements.
During my lifetime I have seen many
reconciliations of theory and practice and
many failures. I believe that the compe-
tition between the two has become less
bitter and more friendly.
Probably the competition will never
end: but this is good, for the reconcilia-
tion of theory and practice affords a con-
tinuing challenge to engineers of all ages.

the end of the world in fifty million

lion."

How to increase bevel
gear life
The shafts that hold the bevel gears in this
farm machine gear box carry two kinds of
loads. Loads from the bevel gears run 1)
along the shaft and 2 ) at right angles to it.
Timken* bearings, being tapered, carry both
loads at once, hold gears rigidly in place.
Perfect tooth-mesh is maintained; gears last
longer.
U J
How TIMKEN' bearings
hold shafts rigid
The line contact between rollers and races of
Timken bearings gives shafts rigid support over a
wide area. Shaft deflection is minimized. And end-
play is eliminated because the tapered design of
Timken bearings lets them take radial and thrust
loads in anv combination.

The development, design, construction and operation of chemical manufacturing plants as
typified by the picture of a "Cat Cracker" is one of the vital and stimulating activities of the human
saga. The prodigious expansion of the chemical industry both in size and diversity of operation
has created unusual technical and executive opportunities in work ranging through sales, market
evaluation, production, development, and research for going men with energy and the ambition
to play a constructive role in our society.
The Chemical Engineering curriculum provides a broad scientific education on which is
superimposed training in the most modern chemical processing techniques and experience in
leading and working with other people.

the topic "Engineering Education at the University of
Michigan." We present it here not because the issues it
raises are new (these things have bothered many people
for a long time), or because it is well written (it is,
though); we present it here because these are the first
impressions of a new freshman and as such seem to have
more meaning than if they were expressed by a jaded up-
perclassman. See if you don't agree.
Upon analyzing the engineering curriculum offered at the
University of Michigan, it is my contention that the ends
which the Engineering School is desirous of gaining are
not to be completely met through the general course of
study offered.
It is brought out in the College of Engineering An-
nouncement (1954-55) that an engineer must be able to
apply scientific knowledge to industrial needs, that he must
satisfy the needs of industry with the natural resources at
hand, and that he must be a manager of men. In view of
this the College of Engineering has made it its educational
objective to develop and produce leaders "for a world
where science, engineering, and hitman relations are of
basic importance." The school has especially prepared its
programs to meet the different desires and aptitudes of
different students, and purports to prepare these students
for leading positions as "practicing engineers, administra-
tors, investigators, or teachers" in this world of science,
engineering and human relations.
Now for a look at the means by which these ends are to
be gained. My interest at present lies in chemical engineer-
ing and since I am more familiar with its program, we shall
look into the curriculum set up there.
In order to get a B.S. in CH.E. students are normally
required to satisfactorily complete a 140 hour program. The
various phases of study and the time spent on them may be
divided up in this way:
Hours
English 10
Math 19
Economics 6
Chem., Physics, and professional subjects 100
Non-Technical Electives 6
In the 10 hours of English, 6 hours are required to be
spent on theme and expository writing, including one hour
of oral speaking. The remaining hours may be taken up
with 2 two-hour electives, dealing with such things as
speaking, composition, or with the reading and analysis of
various types of literature. There is no need to explain what
the 18 hours of math deal with, other than that the span of
instruction goes from college algebra to calculus. The 6
hours of economics are split up into 2 three-hour courses.
The first course is concerned with the fundamentals of ac-
counting and is followed up by a study of todays economic
society, and the applications of economics to questions of
public policy. The main body of the program, taking up
100 hours, is concerned with chemistry, physics, and pro-
fessionally related subjects. Finally, there are 6 hours of
non-technical electives. Here the student is given an op-
portunity to "explore areas other than engineering."
Having enumerated the "ends" and "means" of the
School of Engineering, it is now in order to line up the two
and see if they are in harmony. As was previously stated, it
is the task of the engineer to apply scientific knowledge to
industrial needs, which he must be able to do with the
natural resources at hand. It was also brought out that, be-
sides teaching the students the art of engineering, the Col-
lege of Engineering, acknowledging the importance of
engineering and science today, was preparing their engineers
for positions of leadership in their fields, engineering,
teaching, and investigation) Clearly, these objectives are in
harmony with the means provided. It could not likely be
otherwise, what with approximately 130 hours of 140 be-
ing spent on attaining these ends.
However, the School of Engineering also mentioned
some other objectives for its students. It recognized that an
engineer must be a manager of men, and that human rela-
tions are of basic importance in today's world. Consequent-
ly, its courses of study were also supposed to make of
their outgoing students . . . "managers of men," capable
of occupying administrative positions in a world where
"human relations" were of "basic importance." In general,
the engineers at Michigan are not only supposed to be up
on the principles of bridge-building, but also are supposed
to have an understanding of and be able to work with,
the people who build the bridges.
These objectives are not nearly met by the course of
study offered by the College of Engineering. The 6 hours
of non-technical electives are the only portion of the cur-
riculum which may deal extensively with these latter ob-
jectives, and it is evident that 6 hours of 140, approximately
4% of the total program, can hardly develop "managers
of men," "administrators," or "leaders in a world where
science, engineering, and human relations are of basic im-
portance."
There are methods at hand for solving the problem. One
way would be to have the administration break down and
admit that this engineering course would be more satis-
factory if it were strung out over a period of 5 year in-
stead of being crammed in four. If it were made a 4 year
course it is entirely possible that courses dealing with hu-
man beings and their finer moments might be inserted. Or,
instead of extending the program, there is the possibility of
deleting some expendable parts of the present curriculum
and inserting some study on the literary and artistic side of
the fence. M.I.T. for instance, has a 4-year engineering pro-
gram which incorporates 24 hours of humanities.
In any case, whether these suggested improvements
would be beneficial or not, it seems clear to me that the
University must make some change in the Engineering
School program, or else change the objectives of the school,
for the two are not wholly related.

speaks from experience when he says . . .
"United States Steel
offers first-rate opportunities
in research and product development"
JOHN Bauscher graduated from col-
lege in 1943 with a B.S. degree in
Metallurgy. After a stint in the Navy,
he returned to college as a metallurgi-
cal research assistant. In 1949 he re-
ceived his M.S. in Metallurgy and
then came to work at the U.S. Steel
Applied Research Laboratory. After
just four and a half years, Mr.
Bauscher had progressed to Division
Chief for Sheet Products Develop-
ment — responsible for the improve-
ment of present sheet steel products
and the development of new and im-
proved types.
Why did Mr. Bauscher choose U.S.
Steel? Because, says he, "U.S. Steel
produces such a great diversity of
products and maintains such a thor-
ough research program on all its prod-
ucts — not only theoretical research,
but also applied research or product
development. The graduate engineer
has unusual latitude in selecting the
type of products and the type of re-
search that interest him most. Work is
done not only on steel, but on many
raw materials and by-products as well.
"And," says Mr. Bauscher, "Oppor-
tunities at U.S. Steel are better now
than ever before because of the em-
phasis on product development and
the recent expansion of research
facilities."

Every major aircraft now being assembled relies on the
vibration-proof holding power of ELASTIC STOP nuts.
Only ESNA manufactures a complete line of all types
and sizes of self-locking nuts.
Rollpins are slotted, tubular steel, pressed-fit pins
with chamfered ends. They drive easily into holes
drilled to normal tolerances, compressing as driven.
Extra assembly steps like hole reaming or peening
are eliminated. Rollpins lock in place, yet are read-
ily removed with a punch and may be reused.
Cut assembly costs by using Rollpins as set
screws, positioning dowels, clevis or hinge puis.
Specify them in place of straight, serrated, tapered
or cotter type pins.

At present there are more than 100
helicopters being used commercially
in the United States. Some of these are in
private use but many are used for com-
mercial airline service. They are used for
passenger, mail and freight transport.
British European Airlines started the
world's first helicoptor service several
years ago but because of limitations their
only object was to gain experience for
the time when bigger 'copters were avail-
able.
One of the first American attempts at
helicopter passenger serviceTftok place in
Boston, 1947. It had to be tfffcpntinued
because the workers in downtown areas
complained of the noise. The firs^egu-
Lirly scheduled helicopter passenger^fctv-
ice was inaugurated by New York
ways using Sikorsky S-55 Helicopters cS

Airways had already started it^xd/imfb
cargo service in January, l9WrTtl&amp;
now two other helicopf«&lt;rtnTrmTS—ri
country-, Los Angeles Airways and Heli-
copter Air Service ijfchicago.
Or. the Continent Sabt-na Airlines,
using three seven-s^Bfr Sikorskys operate
regularly from Brussi
dam, Cologne, and Saarbnj^en. the tare
is the same as that of fixflAig aircraft.
On one route from Brussels to Saarbrus-
ken the fare is actually lower than by
train. This service doesn't directly pay for
itself, but indirectly pays by feeding pas-
sengers to Sabena long-haul service. Dur-
ing the first year 100 people took ad-
vantage of this plan, and now passen-
ger service is estimated to be over 1000
annually. European civil authorities are
co-operating with this project.
What are the reasons behind this use
ot helicopters for short haul transporta-
tion? To start off with, one of the heli-
copter's general advantages is its safety.
Actually, today's helicopters have reached
the point in safety of construction and
performance where accidents are virtually
nil. Here is evidence that supports this
claim of safety: during Bell Helicopter's
entire 500,000 flight hours, including
experimental and Korean War flights.
there have been only 251 accidents with
12 fatalities, and the majority of these
were caused by pilot carelessness. Factors
which contribute to their safety are slow
approach speeds, simple navigation, and
improving mechanical reliability, mak-
ing helicopters safer than planes or
autos. As an example of helicopters
low landing speed Bell Aircraft has an
exhibition helicopter "Snow White"
which can land on the top of an elevator
shaft! Moreover helicopters are less af-
fected by low-weather ceilings. Another
safety factor is that when they stall, a
flick of the wrist and the rotor blades are
adjusted so that the rush of air as it goes
down turns the rotors enough to enable
the pilot to make a safe landing.
Perhaps their greatest advantage over
airplanes for a short haul is that they can
land passengers close to their destination,
not at an inconvenient airport. For in-
ure nn-iawplMMf .flight iiom^DeUaiUta

gets in the center of the city thus saving
tune in the long run. The reason they uin
city is that due
cTTr^^JowTanTrTng speed they require
only^Bf square feet of concrete to land
on. This of course leads to another ad-
vantage as less staff is required and
hence lower landing fees are charged.
Being less affected by low weather ceil-
ings helicopters are more punctual than
airplanes.
In the final analysis, however, the fu-
ture of helicopters as a mode of trans-
portation will depend on the economics
of it. Can helicopter flight be made inex-
pensive enough for the normal traveler?
First of all the helicopter's initial cost is
greater than an airplane's because of
intricate mechanical transmission and
rotor systems. These same intricate parts
make for higher maintenance costs
also. There are sixty-five parts that must
be greased on each rotor head assembly
after each trip. The rotor head assembly
costs $75.00 and must be replaced every
100 flying hours making it cost $7.50 per
hour.
Insurance for helicopters costs more
than for airplanes, although rates are
expected to go down when insurance
companies admit the helicopters are safer.
Their depreciation is about the same as
for an airplane.
Also as was pointed out before airport
costs are less. What does this all boil
down to for the traveler? As can be seen
in Figure 1 it looks pretty good. True,
the rates are still too high for the aver-
age traveler in most cases but are defi-
nitely a saving for the business man
whose time is valuable. But a number of
things must be considered. First of all,
the operating costs of helicopter airlines
are going down all the time. When Los
Angeles Airlines first started, their oper-
ating costs were $1.65 a mile: they are
now SO.68 a mile. Second, it must be re-
membered that these rates are based on
a^feven-passenger helicopters. This is be-
cause the only helicoptei certified by
C.A.A. tor commercial passenger service
is the Sikorsky S-55 which has only one
rotor. This limits the
is no mechanical limit
City! Even now several
companies are building large double en-
gined and rotored helicopters which will
hold up to forty passengers. One of them
is pictured in the story. The increase in
passenger capacity itself will lower oper-
ating costs per passenger mile. Indirectly
double rotored helicopters will lower
costs by being able to fly over heavy popu-
lated areas. One engined helicopters can-
not, by law, be used over built up areas
or mountains because of the lack of emer-
gency landing fields. This necessitates un-
necessary mileage, on one flight making
it a 29 mile trip when as the bird flies it's
only 21. This extra mileage adds heav-
ily to the fare.
Neglected 'till now has been the mail
and cargo carrying ability of the heli-
copter. This is where the helicopter really
shines. For five years Helicopter Air Serv-
ices, Inc., in Chicago using Bell 47's has
carried airmail between Midway Airport,
the roof of the main postotfice building
and fifty-five suburban communities. More
than 440,000,000 letters have been carried
since August 1949. Eighteen round trips
between the airport and the postoffice are
made a day and it takes the helicopter

with a minimum of forty minutes for a
postoffice truck. The suburban communi-
ties are served by three circular routes
which are flown three times a day. Flight
times range from forty-five minutes to
two hours.
At the suburban stops, the helicopters
land in fenced off heliports and after a
quick exchange of cargo are airborne
within a couple of minutes and heading
for the next stop.
Records show that residents of these
suburban communities are getting their
airmail from six to thirty-six hours earlier
with the helicopter delivery. Because of
this there has been an increase in the
volume of airmail, jumping as high as
300% in some communities.
Dependability of the helicopters serv-
ing Chicago has peen proved by the more
than 1,238,000 accident free miles flown
during fulfillment of 95.3% of the
scheduled trips. Furthermore over a two
year period not a single scheduled mile
has been lost because of mechanical fail-
ure of a helicopter.
Sabena Belgian Airlines initiated its
helicopter airmail operation in August
1950, the first on the European Contin-
ent. It serves a 268 mile route in Belgium.
During the first year 4,630,000 letters

in deliveries. For example Lederle Lab-
oratories in Pearl River, New York can
deliver rush shipments of important
drugs twenty-four hours quicker with
the use of helicopter service to New
York's three airports.
Owing to the helicopter mail service,
students at Princeton get their mail 24
hours earlier. Over 400,000 pounds of
air freight and 250,000,000 letters have
been handled by New York Airways to
date.
Recently they have signed an agree-
ment with the Railway Express Company
tor the carriage of Air Express by heli-
copter.
The rates on air freight vary from three
to five cents a pound depending on dis-
tance traveled, with a minimum of $1.50
ior inter-airport service and $4.00 for
the longer suburban service.
A great diversity of products can be
carried. Some of the more unusual items
are cattle, bulbs, worms, horses, furni-
ture and wearing apparel on racks or
hangers. Of course there is an additional
charge for the above items. As can be
seen from the above facts and figures,
helicopters are already an important cog
in short haul cargo and air mail service
and stand to grow in importance rapidly.
Of course there are many problems to
be worked out. Present hi-frequency navi-
gation instruments are ineffective behind
buildings and hills. To combat this the
Air Navigation Board of Development
is planning an experimental program to
develop helicopter landing and blind-
flight equipment and techniques. For
short-haul traffic specialized traffic pro-
cedure will have to be developed to main-
tain timetable performance: defined areas
*ill separate fixed wing and rotary wing
aircraft. Automatic flight systems must be
perfected for blind, all-weather and ob-
structed areas. Another question is how
to illuminate a helicopter? Airplanes carry
red lights on their port wing tip and
green on their starboard. Helicopters fly
in any direction so how can port and star-
board be defined?
The average noisiness of today's heli-
copter is 110 decibels at 150 feet, which
is too noisy. For comparison riveting is
95 decibels. Manufacturers are now work-
ing on this problem.
Government regulations must be chang-
ed. The helicopter is now regarded as
just another fixed-wing aircraft, but con-
trary to this philosophy, it is a com-
pletely unique type of vehicle. There-
fore entirely new standards and operating
requirements must be perfected.
Considering the great advantage and
allowing time for the disadvantages to be
worked out it seems inevitable that with-
in ten to fifteen years helicopters will
almost completely replace fixed-wing air-
planes for trips up to 200-250 miles.
Eventually because of elimination of com-
plicated connections, travel time will be
cut fifty percent within a 250 mile radius.

lower fuel consumption and extended range. The speed of this new craft is expected
to exceed the best of present helicopters. Although designed for piston power
plants provision will be made for future use of gas turbines. These will be geared
together so that either or both engines can drive the rotors. Notice the front-

The jet age is upon us with sonic
velocity. The jet engine itself is a complex
unit and the frontiers of design are held
back only by the material available to
withstand the tremendous stresses in-
volved at such great velocities and high
temperatures. Truly, a super metal is
necessary for jet engine components. The
ambient temperature of the interior of a
jet engine under flying conditions hovers
close to 1400°F. which is above the
melting point of aluminum, bronze, and
many of the brasses. The stresses set up
in the turbine blades may amount to
11/2 tons on each blade under these con-
ditions. General Motors Research Labora-
tories has developed GMR-235 alloy
which will stand the stress at high tem-
peratures.
To evaluate the alloy, cast test bars
were subjected to stress-rupture tests
(high-temperature tensile tests at constant
load). The life of the test bars varied
greatly despite the fact that all were
from the same alloy cast in the same way.
An investigation of the casting process
was started in an effort to determine the
source of the data spread.
Test Bar Development
Test bars and turbine buckets of GMR-
235 alloy are cast in investment molds.
The preheated molds were placed on top
of the melting furnace with the down-
sprue over the crucible. Figure 2 shows
an investment mold damped in position
on the induction melting unit. The entire
mold-furnace assemble was inverted and
the molten alloy flowed into the mold
by gravity. The pouring rate was gov-
erned somewhat by the speed with which
the assemble was rolled over. This casting
arrangement was used as a basis for the
transparent mold studies.
At the start of the study, a plaster mold
was sectioned to expose the mold cavity
and faced with glass. High speed motion
pictures were used to record the flow of
mercury in the mold cavity. These initial
experiments showed that poor flow pat-
terns existed in the mold. However, the
mold configuration could not be evaluated
qualitatively since the cross sections were
distorted by sectioning and only the glass-
mercury interface was visible.
Since the test bars were of a relatively
simple shape which could be easily ma-
chined, transparent molds were made
from sheets and tubes of lucite. The melt-
ing crucible was simulated in transparent
plastic. The test fluid used to represent
the molten metal in an actual mold was
water with coloring added and a black
dye was placed in the runners from pour-
ing cup to riser. The amount of liquid
and the time of roll over during which
flow occurred could be determined by ob-
serving the fluid flow in the top runner
and gating system. This technique pro-
vided a means for determining the
amount and distribution of hot metal add-
ed to the risers as the metal that initial-
ly went down the sprue rose in the test
sections to meet it. High speed photog-
raphy was used to record the fluid action
in the mold. The camera used was capable
of slowing the action down to one-six-
teenth of its normal speed.
The first mold investigated was the one
which was being used at that time to
produce test bars and was yielding the
large spread in stress rupture results. The
roll over rates used in production were
determined to be too large. A longer roll
over time reduced the turbulence in the
gates but failed to eliminate the trapped
air in the runners.
Various gating arrangements were ex-
amined with transparent mold models for
attainment of satisfactory fluid flow
characteristics. During examination of
flow characteristics in the models the fol-
lowing factors of mold design and cast-
ing technique were evaluated:
1. Curvature of the downsprue.
2. Geometry of the runner system.
3. Restrictions in gating arrangements.
4. Gating of risers.
5. Venting of mold cavities.
6. Speed of roll over.
In the K-2 mold, a large common riser
was abandoned and each test bar was
provided with an individual riser. Hot
metal was fed into the risers through in-

dividual gates connected to a center run-
ner. The metal was gated into the risers
on the sides away from the downsprue.
This delayed the entry of the metal stream
into the riser until the metal rose above
the test section.
The new mold, as developed by experi-
mentation with transparent plastic molds,
wis evaluated by comparing the test bars
cist in it with bars cast in the original
mold design. The superiority of the K-2
mold showed up in a comparison of test
results. Test bars cast in the Type A, the
original mold, ruptured after an average
of 93 hours at load and 1500°F. Test
bin cast in the developed K-2 mold rup-
tured after an average of 275 hours under
the same test conditions. Variations in the
life of the test bars were reduced from
400% to 12.5% by redesigning the mold.
By developing a method of producing

bars, the previously experienced low test
results were eliminated and high tempera-
ture test results more representative of
the properties of the alloy alone and not
the mold were obtained.
Cast Plastic Mold Models
The success of the fluid flow studies
on the stress rupture test bar molds led
to an investigation of the flow in in-
vestment molds for casting turbine blades
in an effort to lower the scrap rate. The
previous test bar study was conducted
with transparent machined plastic mold
models. However, the shape and intri-
cate design of the turbine blades are not
easily created by the usual fabricating
methods. Fluid flow studies on turbine
blades necessitated a cast plastic mold to
reproduce the desired mold cavities.
Initial attempts to produce cast trans-
parent plastic molds indicated that the

method which showed the most promise
was that of casting a liquid cold-setting
resin about patterns made of a low tem-
perature melting alloy and subsequently
melting the patterns out. In developing
a suitable method for producing trans-
parent plastic molds, it was necessary,
also, to obtain a technique for making
metal patterns which would give mold
cavities of the desired transparency.
Metal patterns of mold components
were made of a low melting alloy of the
following composition: 50% Bismuth,
26.7% Lead, 13-3% Tin, and 10%
Cadmium. The melting point of the al-
loy is 158°F. Patterns were produced by
heating the alloy to 190°F. and casting
into investment molds, plaster molds and
steel injection molds used for making
wax patterns.
If the patterns desired contained no
thin sections, the molds were used at
room temperature. The molds were pre-
heated to 170°F. to enable satisfactory
filling of the thin edges on the turbine
bucket patterns. A slight agitation of the
mold immediately after pouring avoided
entrapment of air in the pattern molds.
As soon as feasible after pouring, the
molds were quenched in water or in car-
bon tetrachloride cooled with dry ice to

This issue of the Michigan Technic is being sent to 1100
high schools throughout the Midwest. It is hoped that it will
reach many times that many readers.
There are several reasons for sending this magazine: First,
we would like to emphasize the importance of engineering and
the part it must play in tomorrow's "brave new world", second,
we would like to build interest in engineering in those graduates
contemplating a career in science or engineering, and third, we
would like to point out the advantages of obtaining the necessary
scientific and engineering education at the University of Michigan.
In the three articles following we have considered various
aspects of the engineering profession with particular emphasis
on education in engineering.
Dean George Granger Brown of the College of Engineering
in "The Dean's Page" outlines the enormous technical progress
that engineers have brought about in the last half century, and
in keeping with the University's tradition of forward thinking,
sketches the background of a new curriculum in Science Engineer-
ing.
"Why Engineering?" by Bob Dye and Cecil Mellin, two engi-
neering freshmen, briefs future freshmen on the engineering
profession as a whole and on the various sorts of tasks engineers
perform.
Howard "Nemo" Nemerowski presents the picture (favor-
able and unfavorable) of an engineer's life at the University of
Michigan. "Engineering at Michigan" considers the shortcomings
and advantages of the engineering curriculum, discusses the
relation between the Engineering College and the rest of the
m
campus, and outlines the breadth of extra-curricular activities
open to engineering students.
It is impossible for any three articles to cover anything as
complex as the processes of maturation and education that take
place during one's college years. This is something that must be
experienced to be understood. We feel that an excellent place
to be educated is the University of Michigan. See if you don't
agree.

Reach for the telephone and a few
spins of the dial or an obliging operator
connects you immediately with anyone

or turn a dial on the television set and
you see and hear what is taking place
from New York to Los Angeles.
Climb into the car, insert the key, push

transportation delivers you anywhere in
as many hours as days were required a
few years ago. If you are willing to fly
with others in a common carrier, you may
reach your destination in hours where
your great grandfather took weeks. If the
weather is bad and the pilot cannot see
the airport, the ground control station
can see the airplane by radar and direct
the pilot by radio to a safe landing. Radar
enables ships on the seas to "see" ice-
bergs or other vessels when they are in-
visible to the eye or to pick up landmarks
for guidance into harbors. Combined
with electronic computers, radar enables
pilodess planes or missiles to seek out
their own targets and destroy the attack-
ing bombers.
Engineers have made remarkable prog-
ress in mastering the fourth dimension—
time—in communication, transportation
and in solving complex problems. The
new electronic computing machines can
now solve problems in minutes instead
of days as required by the older methods.
But do not worry about such robots re-
placing the human mind at present. Such
machines are unable to state problems,
merely to solve them when properly
stated is the limit of their ability.
The extreme importance to the engi-
neer of clearly and accurately stating the
problem before him, is reflected in the
necessity of thorough familiarity with and
precise and effective use of the two lan-
guages—English and Mathematics. This
accomplishment requires constant uses of
these languages for the purpose of ex-
pressing and developing your own ideas
—not merely a study of the form of ex-
pression void of any real significance—but
constant practice in stating real physical
problems in English and in Mathematics
for as many years as possible before en-
tering upon a formal study of engineer-
ing.
The many engineering marvels around
us are generally taken for granted. We do
not appreciate the extent to which our
modern lives and our national security
depends upon a continuing supply of
highly trained engineers and scientists.
These modern technical developments
have effected the lives of the ordinary
citizen and have had a tremendous influ-
ence on the demands made for and upon
our technical graduates.
The older patterns of engineering edu-
cation and activity are changing. Each of
the older engineering disciplines is ex-
panding into wider segments of the field
of technology, in direct response to the
requirements of industry and government,
where little or no consideration is given
to the special field of preparation when
assigning a man to a particular problem.
In responding to these requirements of
the technical world the various educa-
tional programs in engineering tend to
differ more through methods of approach
and emphasis than through different de-
velopments of well defined professional
fields. Most of the area of applied science
is now covered in each of the several
specialized programs which have de-
veloped over the past years. As a new ap-
proach in engineering education the Engi-
neering College at the University is of-
fering a new undergraduate program in
which the emphasis is placed upon ap-
plied science in the solution of engineer-
ing problems without the designation of
any particular field. The program leads
to the degree, Bachelor of Science in
Engineering (Science), and is available to
all entering students who meet the re-
quirements for admission to the Engineer-
ing College. It is aimed particularly to
meet the increasing demand for young
engineers with a sound background in
mathematics and science for research and
development in the new and rapidly ex-
panding technologies. The program pro-
vides excellent preparation for graduate
work in any field of engineering; and is
so arranged that a student may transfer
into any one of the older established pro-
grams without difficulty after completing
two years.

This article is about engineering in gen-
eral, but may on occasion mention Engi-
neering at Michigan in particular. It is
addressed to those who are not engineers,
but who are in a position to choose engi-
neering for their future study. The for-
tunate people who are at that stage in
life when a single decision could posssbly
determine the character of the work they
will do for the rest of their lives would
be well advised to weigh carefully all of
the information available before making
that decision; the information and
opinions included here have been pre-
sented with the hope that those who read
it will be able to make a wiser or at least
a more informed choice, and incidently
with the hope that the choice will be
engineering.
It would, of course, be quite mislead-
ing to suggest that just anyone who want-
ed to could become an engineer; consid-
erably more than the desire is required.
Satisfactory progress in engineering
studies will ordinarily demand better
than the usual in mental ability and is
likely to require that these abilities be
used to a greater extent than would be
necessary in other fields of study. But
then, this sort of information can't be
expected to persuade or dissuade anyone
in his choice of a profession, since the
apparent shortage of people with ordin-
ary abilities makes it unlikely that any of
them would be reading this article. At
least, it could be said that anyone who is
considering a career in engineering will
in all probability attend a college of some
sort, whether he makes the right choice
or not; a certain amount of ability will
be necessary for success in any college
program. So, the prospective engineer is
not likely to ask himself if he has the
ability to succeed in engineering; he will
be much more concerned with what engi-
neering could offer him. He will want to
know what kind of work an engineer
does, and what kind of reward he can be
expected to receive for his work. For
this reason an attempt will be made in
this article to differentiate between the
kinds of work done by the scientist, the
engineer, the technician, and the crafts-
man. The objectives of engineering edu-
cation and the main kinds of engineering
will be briefly described, and several rea-
sons for becoming an engineer will be
discussed. Some of these reasons are good,
solid, selfish ones; others are unselfish and
not as solid, but perhaps more satisfying
in the long run.
Engineers Place in Industry
The scientist, the engineer, the tech-
nician, and the craftsman combine to
form the sequence of workers involved
in the development and manufacture of
some product for public consumption,
starting from the scrambled chaos to the
1,000 piece "jig-saw puzzle" that is na-
ture.
It is the scientist who starts the ball
rolling. Motivated by an intense curiosity
as to the "why of things," the scientist
gropes about in nature for individual
pieces to the puzzle, and when he finds
one, he pulls it out and calls it a "law".
Thus the scientist, in doing this, spends
a great amount of his time on research,
experimental checks, and devising new
methods accompanied by new instru-
ments, for conducting this research and
experimentation.
Many of the discoveries made by sci-
entists have later led to important practi-
cal applications. However, the scientist
is not primarily concerned with the prac-
tical applicatoin of his findings. This,
then, is where the engineer enters into
the picture. He picks up these individual
pieces of knowledge from the gigantic
puzzle and attempts to fit them together,
to give them some practical application.
This is the essence of engineering, the
practical application of the abstract in-
formation handed down from the scient-
ist.
There are certain definite characteristics
to be found in this man who pieces to-
gether the "puzzle." He must have a
sound background in the sciences of
mathematics, physics, and chemistry, as
well as drawing, economics, sociology, and
other subjects related to his particular
field. Incidentally, it is one of the common
misconceptions of the American Public
that an engineer must be manually dexter-
ious. This is not true. An engineer is
neither an inventor, nor a mechanic, but
part of each. His dexterity is mental and
manual; he is driven by a curiosity as to
"how" things work; he is prone to study
and reason; he must be equipped with
an imagination such that he is able to
visualize ways of putting new bits of
knowledge to use; and he must be able to
perform physical experiments. Because
much of the work is done as a team, an
engineer must be able to get along with
people. In addition, an engineer must be
of a practical nature. He must be aware
of such things as developmental and
production costs, he must know where to
get materials and personnel, and he must
be aware of the needs and demands of the
public.
The technician and craftsman, form-
ing the latter half of the aforementioned
worker sequence, now come into the pic-

tions, such as computation, testing appara-
tus, secretarial work, advertisement, etc.,
which does not require a complete engi-
neering education. It is the technician,
the engineer's assistant, who carries out
these operations.
The craftsman or mechanic, having
a great amount of manual dexterity in
using tools to shape raw materials into
useful forms, is the anchor man in our
sequence of workers. It is he who, fol-
lowing the engineer's drawings and speci-
fications, brings the imaginative piecing
together of our "puzzle" by the engineer
to reality.
Engineer's Work
For those of you who have not, as of
the preceding paragraph, decided to give
up engineering, it may be interesting to
find out that there are not just one or
two positions to be had in this profession
but several, and these form a wide range
of choices for those going into engineer-
ing.
First, consider Administration. About
40% of all engineers rise to positions
with high executive responsibilities.
In these jobs, the engineer is concerned
more with human problems and business
decisions than with direct technical activi-
ties, though an engineering education is
essential in the development of the neces-
sary analytic and creative approach in his
work. These men carry the heaviest re-
sponsibilities, but are compensated by re-
ceiving the highest salaries.
Planning and Design is another
phase of engineering in which are en-
gaged about 20% of all professional
engineers. In this highly technical activity,
the engineer, with a careful watch on
costs, lays the groundwork for producing
machines, materials, structures, etc., and
draws up such plans and specifications as
are needed for construction.
About 18% of all engineers work on
Research and Development. In this
activity the engineer sometimes works
alongside the scientist, or in some cases
will himself be the scientist, and come
up with new scientific principles, or a bet-
ter understanding of known phenomena.
The following are five other phases of
engineering: Sales, including 4% of all
engineers, in which the engineer must
be particularly able to meet and deal with
all kinds of people, and is concerned with
selling industrial equipment and spec-
ialized instruments to industry;
and Consulting, containing about 5%
of all engineers, is open to an engi-
neer who has had long experience in a
specific field, and who acts as a consultant
to industries, cities, or other needing the
benefit of his advice and service.
Construction and Installation, incor-
porating 7% of all engineers, in
which the men concerned take the
plans and specifications of some struc-
ture or machine, and turn it into reality,
doing such things as supervising the pur-
chase of materials, the organization of
workers, and issuing and following up
orders on when and how to do the work;
Production and Operation, contain-
ing about 7% of all engineers, in
which the men are concerned with the or-
ganization of operating crews, of mater-
ials, the continuous study of a project's
performance, and the improvement of the
product and its economic production, in
connection with the direction of some in-
dustrial system;
and Teaching, containing less than
3% of all engineers. This phase is com-
posed of those engineers teaching at engi-
neering colleges, the faculties of which
they form the main body.
Education
Having seen where the engineer fits
into the industrial scheme, what qualities
he must have, and what positions are
open to him in engineering, we now come
to the question of education for the engi-
neer.
As has been brought out before, the
engineer must have a thorough, working
knowledge of chemistry and physics, in-
cluding studies in mechanics of solids,
liquids, and gases, heat transfer, optics,
sound, and electricity. Mathematics,
sometimes termed the "language of the
engineer," is another necessary item found
in his education. English, likewise, is a
necessity for the successful engineer.
Other subjects, depending upon the type
of engineering which the individual en-
ters, such as sociology, general economics,
or politics, are necessary to his education.
There are two possible sources for this
education. One is experience. It is pos-
sible for a capable person today to enter
"at the bottom" from high school into
some engineering field, and, if the desire
is there, acquire knowledge as he works.
With the facilities of night school at
hand, this person may some day wind up
on the top of his field.
However, since there is so much basic
scientific principle and theory to be ab-
sorbed by the aspiring engineer, it is
usually the case to get this education
from a four or more year program at an
engineering school. A good program in
engineering, owing to rapid progress and
frequent change in theory made in the
field, is a difficult thing to present. The
College of Engineering at the University
of Michigan, for instance, is constantly
making investigations into the changing
needs of modern engineering, and is con-
stantly seeking to keep its courses, teach-
ing methods, and educational objectives in
line with the needs of young people and
with the needs of the profession which
these young people expect to enter.
The University of Michigan, which has
been teaching engineering for 100 years
and has consistently produced top-grade
men from their school, offers an exem-
plary program for engineers. Ideally an
engineering education has its beginnings
in high school, where the student inter-

by HOWARD NEMEROVSKI, '54M.E.
The typical Engineering student at the
University of Michigan is perhaps one
of the most widely defamed members of
the human race. If you were to stroll up
to a non-engineering student on the Ann
Arbor campus, tap him on the shoulder
and ask how to find an "Engineer," you
would see this student gulp as if nauseat-
ed, shudder in horror, and reel off a list
of adjectives at an amazing clip.
"An Engineer?" he will mutter. "Why,
he's easy to spot. Just look for an under-
weight, nervous looking, socially retarded
introvert wearing a pair of greasy "levis,"
a heavy wool shirt, and a slide rule dang-
ling from his belt. He'll be tough to find,
'though, because he's usually in his room
working on some intellectually sterile
problems or drawings. Besides, if you did
find one, I doubt if he'd be able to hold
an intelligent conversation with you."
This writer will have to admit to de-
veloping a very similar impression of his
fellow Engineering students during his
first months at the University of Michi-
gan. Everywhere I went I was surrounded
by these mechanical-genius, intellectual-
idiots (or so I thought!). The only words
I heard them speak concerned motors,
chemical, and nuclear physics. English
classes were reciprocating horror cham-
bers. Many students were horrified, even
angered, by consistently losing battles
with the language they were supposed to
have grown up with. The instructors were
horrified in turn at being confronted by
"virtual dolts." A sentence diagram
seemed as unfamiliar to the students as
was an electrical schematic diagram to the
English instructors.
At the end of the first semester, a few
students were walking around smilingly
boasting a 3.4 average out of 4.0— they
neglected to tell their families or friends
that the 3.4 average resulted from A's in
Chemistry, Mathematics, and Drawing,
all of which compensated for the D's in
English and Speech.
This first impression, I found out, was
the exception rather than the rule. As I
grew to know my fellow students, I began
to understand them, like them, and to see
them in a different light. Now that I have
finished four years at Michigan, I can
think back to my experiences and con-
tacts with these Engineering students and
help destroy the myth by giving a more
accurate picture of the life of a University
of Michigan Engineering student.
But before we do this, let us first
digress and examine the University itself.
One of the misfortunes of a State Uni-
versity is that it must accept a great pro-
portion of the state residents that apply
for admission. Doing this, it must allow
for the varying degrees of high school
education available to these high school
graduates entering the University. For
this reason, and also because of financial
limitations, the University must select
what it believes to be the average level of
technical courses and offer these to the
entering Freshman. Thus, the Michigan
Engineering Freshman is not able to be-
gin with Calculus, Physics, Chemistry and
many of the comparably advanced courses
available to the enrolling freshman at the
wealthier, privately endowed, technical
schools such as Cal Tech, MIT, Rose
Polytech, etc.
At Michigan the average beginning
course consists of College Algebra, Chem-
istry, Engineering Drawing, English, and
Speech plus a non-credit orientation lec-
ture course. (Certain exceptions are made,
however, so that the better-trained stu-
dent may enroll in an advanced Mathe-
matics course and an accelerated one-
semester Chemistry course.)
This program of average level courses
continues throughout the beginning years
at the University. Certain advantages are
cited for this concept, one being that it
enables the less well-trained student to
catch up and prepare himself for his
"major," i.e., the specicc field of engi-
neering he wishes to study, more ade-
quately than he could at an accelerated
school. This, however, is a somewhat dis-
heartening procedure to the few better-
trained and more gifted students who,
with the exception of those courses I
mentioned as being available to the su-
perior student, must wander disinterest-
edly through several courses during the
first years which are no challenge to their
intelligence. In addition, because of the
time consumed in taking elementary
courses and because of the vast number
of courses required for graduation, the
average Michigan engineer must attend
school for 4!/2 years, perhaps 5, in order
to graduate, thus prolonging his educa-
tion when compared with many other
colleges and engineering schools.
A much more serious disadvantage re-
sulting from the necessity of offering
average-level courses is the impossibility
of utilizing class time at the University
to offer more Liberal Arts courses to engi-
neers. Some other engineering schools
offer four or five year programs, but,
because they are able to eliminate the be-
ginning courses that the University is
forced to retain, these other schools offer
courses in History, Literature, Sociology,
etc., all of which are valuable in broaden-
ing the Engineer's mind and personality.
Howard Nemerovski, author of Engi-
neering at Michigan, is probably one of
the most active men on the campus. He
was president of the Senior Engineering
class of '54, vice-president of the Michi-
gan Union in '53 and '54. He has been
'tapped' by many campus honorary so-
cieties: Michigamau, Vulcans, Triangles,
Mimes, and Toastmasters. In addition, he
is author of the Union Operas of '53 and
'54, and served on the Engineering Honor
Council and the all-campus Senior Board.
He will enter Law School in February and
plans to be married in June.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


partly compensated for by the one great
advantage the University offers to resi-
dents of the state, namely, that of en-
abling the average high school graduate
to get excellent technical training with a
minimum of cost. This is a far cry from
the past decades where only the wealthy
few were granted this privilege.
I should hasten to add that Michigan
not only attracts state students; approxi-
mately 30% of the University's students
come from states other than Michigan,
and, since requirements are very high for
out-of-state students, these are, on the
whole, above average students in training
as well as ability. Add to this the goodly
portion of in-state students that are above
average, and it can be seen that Michigan
has its share of academically superior,
outstanding students. Any misconception
that the reader might have regarding this
should be rapidly dispelled.
But enough of the academic considera-
tions. Let's discuss the life of the aver-
age engineer at Michigan. The academic
task is anything but an easy one; the
engineering curriculum, even a compara-
tively slowed down one, is enough to tax
the minds of the students. It is easily
understood where the engineer gets his
undeserved reputation as a room-dweller,
anti-social butterfly, etc.—he just doesn't
have all the time that the other students
have to "goof off"—he seems to utilize
every spare moment for studying. It is
true that he studies very hard, but, and
here's the catch, he studies very efficiently!
There is nothing mentally or physically
wrong with the Engineer; he dates,
"goofs off" when he can, and contributes
more than his share to the campus through
activities. Let's elaborate on this further.
At a large institution like Michigan
there is a myriad of entertainment facili-
ties just for the asking: movies, concerts,
lectures, athletics, parties, etc., and the
engineer is not one to be left out. After a
short time on campus he realizes the need
for diversion and proceeds to make the
most of it.
Engineers take as active a part in Dor-
mitory activities as do non-engineers;
there is also a proportionate share of
Engineers in the Fraternity system, tak-
ing a creditable part in house functions
and government.
In the realm of intercollegiate athletics
the engineering student seems to be super-
human; engineers comprise an amazingly
high percentage of participating athletes
on Michigan teams. On the 1953 starting
football squad, for example, the tailback,
fullback, a tackle and a guard were
engineers, with a large number of engi-
neers on the second and third teams.
Similarly with other sports; somehow
athletics seem to appeal to engineers—
perhaps it's the desire for precision, the
intricate coordination, or the need for
quick thinking that draws him in, or per-
haps they need relief from the pressure of
his studies.
In the field of extracurricular activities
the story is much the same. It is not the
intention of this article to unduly glorify
my fellow students, but it is difficult to
hold back enthusiasm and admiration for
the large number of engineering students
who realize their obligation to their col-
lege community and enter the field of
extracurricular activities.
Michigdmua, the all-campus Senior
Men's extracurricular honorary, gives an
indication of the extent to which Engi-
neers participate. Each year a creditable
number of engineers are selected for this
outstanding honor. The Engineering Col-
lege has its own Senior and Junior activi-
ties honoraries, Vulcans and Triangles,
and the continued success of these two
organizations over the last half-century
offers proof of the interest the engineer-
ing student shows in campus affairs.
Many students confine their energies
to Engineering College activities, such as
the professional engineering societies, the
Engineering Council, the Engineering
Honor Council (about which I will elab-
orate later), and others. The all-campus
activities, such as the "Michigan Daily"
(one of the finest college newspapers in
the country), the '"Ensian" (an equally
fine yearbook), the Michigan Union, the
Glee Club, and many other activities and
clubs all boast their share of engineers.
I referred previously to the Engineer-
ing Honor Council. This council is or-
ganized to administer the Engineering
Honor Code, one of the most successful
ventures of its kind. Course examinations
are given with no faculty members in the
room; students are put on their honor
not to violate their trust, and it is only
the rare student who will cheat under
these conditions. The effect of this sys-
tem is amazing. It builds up the integrity
and the feeling for honesty that is so
esential to the practicing engineer and
businessman.
In the preceding pages I have under-
taken to depict the story of the engineer
at the University of Michigan. True, I
have presented some of our shortcomings,
but I have tried to show the good side as
well. I began with the usual incorrect
stereotype of the Michigan Engineer, and
then proceeded to show him as he really
is: not actually much different from his
non-engineering fellow students, a little
harder pressed for time, but still able to
lead the normal life of a college student.
Only at a large institution like Michigan
can the engineering student avail himself
of opportunities of relief from the grind
of studies by participating in the wide
variety of activities and events on the
campus. Too often the technical school
continues the apparent narrowness of the
profession into all student life and ac-
tivity, with none of these opportunities
of relief.
Without trying to drag out the hearts
and flowers, this writer's happiest days
were spent at Michigan as an engineering
student. They might have been just as
happy elsewhere, but it doesn't really
seem possible. Michigan has been an ex-
perience probably never to be equalled
in a lifetime. To paraphrase Horace
Greely: If you would have a good educa-
tion (and spend the greatest four, or
four and a half or five years of your life),
"Go West, Young Man"—to Michigan.
Study Made of Atmospheric Tides
A study of "The Atmospheric Lunar
Tides," one of a series of "Meteorologi-
cal Papers" of New York University's
College of Engineering was issued No-
vember 23 by the NYU Press.
The author is Ryukichi Sawada, who
conducted his research at the College's
department of meteorology and ocean-
ography during a leave of absence from
the Central Meteorological Observatory
in Tokyo, Japan. The work was supported
in part by the Geophysical Research Di-
rectorate of the Air Force Cambridge
Research Center.
Dr. Sawada studied some 20 different
hypothetical vertical temperature distribu-
tions and the resulting lunar tides. His
paper suggests how the seasonal varia-
tions of the lunar air tide may possibly be
explained by changes in the air tempera-
ture at high levels.

Engineering Department, E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co.
Who will be the leaders of the engi-
neering profession twenty years from
now? forty years from now?
It is my hope that these destined lead-
ers will be among the readers of this brief
article. Merely to pose such questions will
be enough to fire or rekindle their ambi-
tions; to fortify their determination to
excel, each in his chosen line, and to merit
recognition from their fellows.
i It is not just these, however, that I am
addressing. It is the whole body of pros-
pective members of the profession. It is
their choice of leadership that will de-
termine the direction in which the pro-
fession will move.
We celebrated in 1952 the Centen-
nial of Engineering, signaling the 100th
anniversary of the founding of the Amer-
ican Society of Civil Engineers. What
strides America has made in that time!
The spread of the railways across the con-
tinent, helped by the introduction of the
Bessemer process for making steel and
then the open-hearth; the electric indus-
try, the electric light, the dynamo, and the
electric motor; the automobile, the high-
way system, the petroleum industry; the
airplane, making us neighbors to the
whole wide world; mass production, mak-
ing labor-saving devices available to the
mass market; new metals, aluminum,
magnesium, titanium; the chemical indus-
try, bringing us luxuries, comforts, and
aids to health and prolongation of life;
the telephone, and now electronics, af-
fording instant communication, and
bringing information and entertainment
into every home at any hour of day or
night; the advent of atomic power, prom-
ising freedom from dependence on fossil
fuels, and perhaps by the very awsome-
ness of its force making large-scale wars
less probable. Every branch of science
and technology, of course, has had its
part in the achievements of these 100
years, but it is the engineer who has been
at the focal point of every one of them.
It is the engineer who has been there to
make them work: that's been his business.
With technology advancing at that
pace, what will be the achievement of the
next hundred years? It staggers the im-
agination. If not to project so far, what
about the next forty years, the period
which your career will have a part in
shaping? Or within some almost percept-
ible horizon, the next twenty years? If
we only project at the present pace, with-
out taking account of its acceleration, any
of you can forsee the demands on techno-
logical skills that will crowd in on you
in your own engineering careers.
Now I would like to ask you to think
what kind of engineers these were that
helped bring about the achievements of
the past century. With such accomplish-
ments to their credit, you can be pretty
sure that they were, most of them, men
who took every problem for a challenge,
every difficulty for an opportunity. I can't
believe that they were clock-watchers—
or, "in case they didn't like inside work,
whistle-listeners." By and large, they must
have been men who set out, not just to
earn a living, but to help make the world
a better place to live in. It was thus that
they helped to establish and constitute
engineering as a profession as we know
it.
Now, what direction will the profession
take during your active practice of it?
It will depend on the leadership you ex-
ert, or the leadership that you elect to
follow. The choice, in any event, is yours.
The kind of leadership you may exert
later will be determined in large measure
by the proven leadership you choose to
follow now. Where can you find such
leadership? The profession is not static:
the leaders in the rapid pace of today's
engineering developments are active here
and now. Recognizing their obligation to
advance the profession as well as to make
their individual technological contribu-
tions, they have associated themselves
with the societies representing their

Dr. Thomas H. Chilton was born in Alabama in 1899. Went to the University of
Alabama, then to Columbia University where he received the degree of chemical
engineer in 1922. The University of Delaware conferred upon him the degree of
Doctor of Science in 1943.
Following graduation from Columbia, Dr. Chilton worked in New York City as
a research chemist.
In 1925 he joined Du Pont Company's Experimental Station. From there on in
he went steadily up the ranks until he reached his present position of technical direc-
tor of the Development Division of the Du Pont Company's Engineering Department

tk Sandia Corporation, a subsidiary of the Western Electric Company, offers
outstanding opportunities to graduates with Bachelor's or advanced degrees, with
or without applicable experience.
tk Sandia Corporation engineers and scientists work as a team at the basic task of
applying to military uses certain of the fundamental processes developed by
nuclear physicists. This task requires original research as well as straightforward
development and production engineering.
kk A new engineer's place on the Sandia team is determined initially by his
training, experience, and talents . . . and, in a field where ingenuity and
resourcefulness are paramount, he is afforded every opportunity for professional
growth and improvement.
tk Sandia engineers design and develop complex components and systems
that must function properly under environmental conditions that are much
more severe than those specified for industrial purposes. They design and
develop electronic equipment to collect and analyze test data; they build
instruments to measure weapons effects. As part of their work, they are
engaged in liaison with the best production and design agencies in the
country, and consult with many of the best minds in all fields of science.
Sandia Laboratory, operated by Sandia Corporation under contract
with the Atomic Energy Commission, is located in Albuquerque — in
the heart of the healthful Southwest. A modern, mile-high city of 150,000,
Albuquerque offers a unique combination of metropolitan facilities plus
scenic, historic and recreational attractions — and a climate that is
sunny, mild, and dry the year around. New residents have little diffi-
culty in obtaining adequate housing.
Liberal employee benefits include paid vacations, sickness bene-
fits, group life insurance, and a contributory retirement plan.
Working conditions are excellent, and salaries are commensurate
with qualifications.
A limited number of positions for Aeronautical Engineers,
Mathematicians, and Physicists are also available.

branch of engineering, and can be found
guiding its counsels, working for its ad-
vancement, and many of them working
toward the goal of a common organiza-
tion that will represent the profession as
a whole. Read the biographical accounts
of recent candidates for high office in the
society representing the branch for which
you are preparing yourself, as given in the
society's magazine every year. You'll find
plenty of examples among such men that
you will want to emulate.
Nearer at hand, you will find outstand-
ing engineers in every branch taking part
in activities of the local sections of the
engineering societies, and you can by di-
rect observation decide for yourself their
fitness for leadership.
It is at this point that I want to draw
attention to what I consider a danger that
confronts the profession at the present
time. I do not know whether it arises out
of a herd instinct for security; or out of
the practice of some unenlightened man-
agements in dealing with members of
their engineering staff en masse instead
of treating them as individual members
of a creative profession; or out of vague
feelings that engineers generally have not
participated in the increases in earnings
that manual workers have been gaining
(actually made possible by technological
advances to which engineers have largely
contributed). For whatever cause, some
have come to advocate that engineering
employees should join together in bar-
gaining groups, or unions. Such unions
would, they insist, of course be limited to
professional personnel, as specifically pro-
vided under the protective safeguards of
the present U.S. statutes. It may be true
that one can find, here and there, em-
ployers of engineers who confound the
creative contribution made by profession-
al engineers on their staffs with the work
of subprofessional grades, and fail to ac-
cord engineers appropriate recognition as
members of a profession. It has also been
one of the marks of our times that the
income of intellectual workers generally
has not increased as rapidly as that of
skilled or semiskilled manual wage-earn-
ers in the inflationary era of the past
twenty years or so, which is all that most
of us have experienced. But there are
other avenues available for improvement.
Without dependence on "collective bar-
gaining," the less enlightened employers
can be brought to understand what it is
(Continued from page 24)
that members of the engineering and sci-
entific professions feel they need in the
way of recognition, in such simple matters
as privilege of attending society meetings,
for example. And surveys conducted by
the professional societies will show both
employers and those earning salaries how
rates compare with other callings.
This is a serious matter. Several of the
engineering societies have felt strongly
enough about it to adopt a resolution,
offered through the Engineers Joint Coun-
cil, as presented by the American Institute
of Chemical Engineers, declaring that
"the enhancement of the status of the
engineer is best promoted by his reliance
upon his personal professional growth
and accomplishment, and that his status
as a professional man is endangered by
reliance upon group efforts to act on his
behalf in reaching short-range economic
objectives; while at the same time the
corresponding obligation is laid upon
the employer of engineers to give each
professional employee his due individual
recognition as a member of the profes-
sion."
The important fact I want to point out,
however, is that engineers qualified to
exert leadership in the profession almost
inevitably are called, at some stage in
their careers, from the ranks to some level
of supervision of engineers or manage-
ment of an enterprise. Thus, under the
provisions of the laws that protect labor
unions from domination by management,
they become disqualified from member-
ship in groups made up of employees to
act as bargaining agencies. Adherence of
engineers to such groups therefore de-
prives them of the opportunity to asso-
ciate with the more rapidly advancing
members of their profession, on which I
have placed such stress.
It is no more true than with most epi-
grams that "to be a leader of men, one
must turn his back on men." The leader
with the most devoted following is the
one who has the real individual interest
of his men at heart. The engineer who
advances upward into the levels of man-
agement of engineering forces does not
easily forget the steps by which he rose.
In an organization in which all levels are
joined in support of the profession, he
can maintain such association as will as-
sure his appreciation of the aspirations
and needs of the rank and file.
Finally, I cannot believe that the engi-
neer entering the profession today wants
to limit in any way his advancement, in
the face of the opportunities awaiting
him in this challenging world of complex-
technology. I believe he wants to be free
to choose what leadership he will follow
in setting out to make his own mark in
the profession. I believe he only wants to
be assured that he can earn recognition
based on his own contribution in his
technical field, whether as an individual
or as a member of a team.
What kind of leadership are you will-
ing to follow? What kind of leadership
are you prepared to offer when your
chance comes?

by JOHN A. KATHERLER, '58E
During the 17th, 18th, and 19th cen-
turies the shotgun provided protection
and food for many pioneers and trappers.
Today the shotgun is used mainly for
pleasure. It provides a means of "getting
away from it all" for many people,
through the sport of hunting. Besides
being used for hunting purposes, the
shotgun is used for trap and skeet shoot-
ing.
There are three main types of shotguns
which should be considered when you are
going to buy one: the pump, the double
barrel and the automatic.
The pump is a single barrel repeating
type gun. The repeating system is oper-
ated by sliding the fore-stock, which is
the handle beneath the barrel, back and
then forward. Sliding the fore-stock
back ejects the used shell. Pushing it
forward puts a new shell into the cham-
ber, or rear of the barrel.
The double barrel is a two barrel gun.
It has two triggers, one for each barrel,
and also has a different choke, or con-
striction of the muzzle for each barrel.
To load the gun, you simply open the
breech, by sliding a lever and pressing
down on the barrels, and insert the shells
into the chambers.
The automatic is a single barrel re-
peating type gun. Its repeating action is
entirely automatic. Pulling the trigger
fires the shot and automatically changes
the shell.
The stock is a wooden piece which is
used to hold the barrel in correct firing
position. The bull of the stock fits the
right shoulder and the right hand grips
the fore part of the stock. The index,
or trigger finger, is extended and curled
around the trigger. The left arm is ex-
tended and grips the fore-stock to support
the weight of the barrel. The hunter will
find that his swing will be easier and
smoother with the left arm extended as
far as possible.
The barrel provides a means of direct-
ing the load of shot to the target. This
load of shot starts its speedy trip from
the shell, which consists mainly of the
case, the powder charge, the felt wads,
and the shot pellets.
For approximately one-fourth of its
length, the case is made of brass; the re-
maining three-fourths is made of waxed
cardboard. On the brass end of the shell,
there is a rim by which the shell is
clamped in place when it is fired. In the
center of this end is the primer, which is
shaped like a small convex lens.
The powder charge is located in the
brass end of the shell and is immediately
next to the inside of the primer. Packed
on top of the powder are two or three
felt pads or "wads," which fill about one-
fourth of the shell. The shot pellets are
packed on top of these wads. When these
components are packed tightly into the
shell, y4 to y2 of an inch of the card-
board tube is left extending above the
shot pellets. This remaining cardboard is
folded or "crimped" tightly over the shot
pellets.
The primer explodes when it is struck
a hard blow by the firing pin, much the
same as a top cap explodes when it is
hit sharply. This explosion lights the
powder charge which creates expanding
gases. These gases push against the wads,
and in turn against the shot, forcing them
through the barrel at high velocities. The
action of the shotgun shell can be com-
pared to a fly sprayer. The expanding gas
would compare to the force pushing on
the handle; the wads would compare to
the piston; and the shot would compare
to the spray coming out the nozzle.
The action consists of many different
parts, all housed in the receiver. The
function of the action is to take the used
shell from the chamber and put a new
one in. The way this is done varies with
each type and make of gun.
The pump or slide action shotgun con-
sists of four main parts: the stock, the
barrel, the sights and the action.
The stock is a wooden shoulder piece
by which the barrel and action are held
and fired. It acts as a lever when the gun
is fired at a moving target. The stock is
usually made of hard wood, such as wal-
nut, though it can be made of plastic.
Most American stocks are varnished be-
cause it is much cheaper than the better,
linseed oil hand rubbed stock. Varnish
finishes will show scratches, but if it is
taken care of a varnish finish will last
indefinitely.
Shotgun stocks are produced with a
straight grip and with a pistol grip. The
straight stock has an even taper from the
heel to the part which fits onto the re-
ceiver. The pistol grip is more com-
fortable and allows the trigger finger to
move straight back; that is the hand is
perpendicular to the trigger, instead of
being at an oblique angle as it is with the
straight stock. As the pistol grip part of
the stock is held with the right hand,
the extension fits against the right should-
er.
The butt plate is attached to the butt
or heel of the stock to prevent the stock
from splitting or chipping. It is usually

made from steel or hard rubber and is
scored or checkered to prevent the stock
from slipping at the shoulder. If you are
going to do a great deal of shooting, or
use very heavy loads, a sponge-rubber
recoil pad fastened to the butt plate is a
great help. This pad absorbs some of the
recoil and prevents the shoulder from be-
coming bruised and sore.
The fore stock is usually made of the
same material as the stock, either wood or
plastic. It is more or less tubular shaped
with rounded ends. It is ribbed or check-
ered to prevent the hand from slipping
when working the pump mechanism.
The barrel consists of a steel tube
through which the shot is forced by the
explosion of the powder charge. Modern
barrels are made from high quality,
forged steel. These barrels are tested with
loads which generate pressures far in
excess of any manufactured ammunition.
The barrels are finished on the outside
by a blueing process which resists rusting
and prevents glare. The inside is untreat-
ed to assure a perfectly smooth bore
which is necessary for a good shot pat-
tern. The core should be cleaned and oil-
ed to prevent rust and dirt from forming,
which will disrupt the dispersal or pat-
tern of the shot if left in the bore.
Barrel lengths vary from twenty to
thirty-two inches. Hunting guns are gen-
erally twenty-six to thirty-two inches in
length, and within these limits there is no
noticeable difference in shooting qualities,
provided the barrels have the same choke.
The 20" guns are called riot guns. They
have a very large pattern at a short dis-
tance and are used for police work.
All shotgun barrels are described in
terms of "cylinder bore", "modified",
and "full choke." Choke means that the
inside diameter at the muzzle is smaller
than at the breach. This change in diam-
eter usually starts about 3 inches from
the muzzle, giving an effect similar to the
nozzle of a hose. There is a limit of con-
striction beyond which the mass of shot
cannot be compressed without deform-
ing the individual shot and thereby caus-
ing holes or empty spaces in the shot
pattern.
A cylinder bore gun has an inside
barrel diameter which is the same from
breach to muzzle. Modified choke means
that there is a slight constriction, or a
small cone at the end of the barrel. Full
choke means that this cone has the maxi-
mum practical constriction. A cylinder
bore gun should place 40 per cent of the
shot charge in a 30 inch circle at 40
yards distance. A modified barrel should
place 60 per cent, and a full choke bar-
rel 70 to 80 percent of their shot charges
in a 30 inch circle at a distance of 40
yards.
Devices for changing the choke of a
barrel can be attached to the muzzle of
any single barrel gun. These devices work
like the aforementioned nozzle of a hose.
They consist of a chuck type arrangement,
like a chuck on a drill, so that when
the slip ring is tightened the chuck
closes and makes a tighter pattern. An-
other type consists of different sized
tubes which are screwed to the muzzle by
a special wrench.
The size of the barrel is indicated by
the term "gauge"; the largest is a 10
gauge and the smallest is .410 gauge.
Gauge represents the number of round
lead balls the same size as the bore
which are contained in a pound. Thus 12
balls, the diameter of a 12 gauge, are
required to weigh one pound. From
largest to smallest the gauges manufac-
tured today are 10, 12, 16, 20, and .410.
The sight on a shotgun usually consists
of one, small, shiny bead located on the
muzzle. On the more expensive models
there is a rib or track to sight along on
the top of the barrel. In this case the
bead is located on the end of the rib, but
in other cases there will be another bead
located at the approximate middle of the
rib. The bead is usually made of steel or
ivory.
The term "action" refers to the entire
firing mechanism of a gun. The action of
a pump gun is too complicated to discuss
in detail so I will deal only with the
fundamentals. Briefly, the shells are put
into the tubular magazine under the bar-
rel and are fed into the chamber by the
carrier, which also holds the shells in
place in the magazine. The breech block
is a cylinder containing the firing pin and
extractor. It is located at the top of the
receiver and directly behind the shell
chamber. When the slide is in the for-
ward position the action is locked in
firing position. When the slide is pulled
back, the used shell is ejected and the car-
rier lifts a shell from the magazine into a
position directly in front of the breech

GE Develops Solar Powered
Radio Transmitter
A solar-powered experimental radio
transmitter, the size of a package of cig-
arettes, has been built by a General Elec-
tric development engineer.
The transmitter is self-contained. It
uses transistors instead of electron tubes,
and selenium solar energy converters in-
stead of batteries. When light rays strike
the selenium, sufficient electrical energy is
developed to the transistors to operate
the transmitter.
Edward Keonjian, who designed the
unit in the company's Electronics Labora-
tory, says the transmitter was made to
stimulate interest in transistors.
Keonjian says transistors are used in
the transmitter's oscillator circuit because
they operate on comparatively small
amounts of power and require much less
space than tubes.
Keonjian has been engaged in advanc-
ed development work on transistors in
the G. E. Electronics Laboratory since
1951.
The company's germanium products
group here is planning to use the trans-
mitter in transistor application demon-
strations, Keonjian says, and ten more of
the transmitters will be built for this
purpose.
The transmitter currently has a short
range, about 100 feet, which could be
improved, Keonjian explains, by increas-
ing the number of selenium solar energy
converters or using silicon or germanium
instead of selenium.
A home or car radio is used by Keon-
jian to receive messages broadcast by the
transmitter.
Developments in light sensitive ele-
ments over the next decade may make
practical small personal radio transmitters
and receivers powered by solar energy,
Keonjian believes.

for advancement
at Du Pont?
i N. Zartman is studying for a B.S. in Chemical Engineering at the
University of Illinois. Last summer he worked in the Technical Laboratory at
Du Pont's Chambers Works to gain industrial experience. He has not yet
selected a permanent employer, however; and right now he's asking the kind
of questions which will help him select the right job and plan a successful career.
Sheldon Isakoff answers:
Dr. Sheldon Isakoff received his Ph.D. degree in
Chemical Engineering from Columbia University
in 1952, doing his graduate research work on the

An advanced degree would undoubtedly have a favorable effect
in technical work, Bill, but let me enlarge on that just a little.
In my own field—chemical engineering—a doctorate is consid-
ered to be evidence of demonstrated ability in carrying out
original research. An advanced technical degree is therefore
helpful in obtaining work in research and development, where
that skill is definitely important. You might say it gives a man
a head start in proving his ability in those areas.
It's less important in some other areas, though. For example,
in production or sales work a manifest ability for handling
human relationships is just as important for advancement as
technical competence. If an engineer is sold on production work
or sales, a graduate degree in marketing or business adminis-
tration might be more helpful to him than advanced technical
training—in getting started.
But I've noticed this at Du Pont. Once a man lands a job in
his chosen field and actually begins to work, his subsequent
advancement depends more on demonstrated ability than on
college degrees. That's true throughout the entire company—
in scientific work, administration, or what not.
So an advanced degree is not a royal road to anything at
Du Pont, Bill. But when coupled with proved abilities, an ad-
vanced technical degree is unquestionably helpful to a man in
research and development work. It often gives him a chance to
demonstrate his abilities more rapidly.

simplification of product designs to elim-
inate costly manufacturing manhours
once a basic design is established. Where
designers reappraise product details for
welded steel construction, production
costs are being cut an average of 5056 com-
pared with manufacture using castings.
Manufacturing operations are simpli-
fied with welded steel design. Rejections
due to inferior metal are eliminated. Less
machining and finishing are required.
Finished machines are streamlined, more
modern in appearance.
In the example below, an economy-
minded design engineer lowered manu-
facturing cost on a machine arm and cut
weight of the arm.
Before conversion to steel, the machine
arm required 182 pounds of gray iron
and cost $38.25 to cast and machine.
Welded steel design weighs only 86.8
pounds .. . costs $20.06.

block. When the slide is shoved forward,
the breech block forces the shell into
the chamber and then locks in firing posi-
tion.
The safety lock is located on the for-
ward part of the trigger guard. It is a
cross bar type activated by the index or
trigger finger. Usually the end is paint-
ed red to denote whether the safety is
"on" or "off." When the red end is pro-
jecting it is off.
The pump gun is light weight and the
cheapest of the repeating type shotguns.
The fact that the pump gun has one
barrel is also an asset to the hunter using
it. When a person shoots at a bird, or any
game, he doesn't actually close one eye to
take aim and fire. He keeps both eyes
open so that he can keep the target in
sight. He doesn't look at the bead either,
but he is conscious of it while he is aim-
ing. A single barrel is easier for the eye
to focus on without looking directly at
the barrel, than the double barrel is.
When you hold a pencil directly in front
of your face and look at an object 50
yards away, you can't see all of the ob-
ject. If you hold up two pencils you see
less of the object than you saw before.
The same holds true in the case of the
single and double barrels. The difference
is that your eye is looking down the top
of the barrel and you are only "aware"
of it, you don't actually look at the bar-
rel. If there were two barrels your aware-
ness or distraction would cover a larger
area. Therefore you wouldn't be able to
focus your eye as easily on a distant ob-
ject as you could with a single barrel.
Among hunters there is a controversy
about which is better, the pump or the
automatic? When an expert with a pump
and an expert with an automatic compete
against each other their scores are gener-
ally about the same, in terms of speed
and accuracy. This suggests that a pump
gun, when used correctly, can be fired as
rapidly and as accurately as an automatic.
The automatic is heavier and costs more
money than the pump.
The pump has one limitation. It is
difficult to clean all its parts efficiently. A
pump gun is constructed so that it is
difficult to take apart therefore difficult to
clean all the parts efficiently. The barrel
can be cleaned thoroughly by using a
long rod and an oiled rag, but to clean
the action requires that the gun be taken
apart. This should be done by a gunsmith.
He knows how to do it with the least
damage to the parts; such is not the case
with an amateur. Cleaning the barrel will
help to keep the gun clean from day to
day but, over a period of two or three
years, the gun should be cleaned by a
competent gunsmith.
In comparison to the other types of
guns, the pump has the most advantages.
It is lighter in weight than the automatic
or the double. When it is used correctly,
it will repeat as rapidly and shoot as ac-
curately as an automatic will. It is easy to
aim and fire. It also holds more shells
than the double or the single shot. The
pump gun is the most versatile gun manu-
factured today. If you intend to buy a
gun, you would be wise to purchase a
pump.
The pump has three main parts: the
barrel, the stock and the action. The barrel
serves as a means for directing the load
of shot to the target. It consists of a steel
tube which is highly polished on the in-
side so that there will be no obstructions
to disrupt the shot pattern and blued on
the outside to preserve the steel and to
prevent glare. The stock is a piece of
hardwood, such as walnut or maple, used
to hold the barrel in firing position.
The word "action" refers to the repeat-
ing and firing mechanisms. The trigger
mechanism serves to release the firing pin
and fire the shell at the desired moment.
The repeating mechanism takes the fired
shell from the chamber and puts a new
one in. The new shells are taken from a
tube, on which the forestock slides, be-
neath the barrel. The repeating system is
activated by moving the fore-stock back
and then forward.
A pump gun is a wise choice for a
person who wants a very versatile weapon.
If you don't know exactly what kind of
hunting you are going to do, or if you
want a gun which can be used for all
kinds of hunting, I recommend a pump
type shotgun.
Happy New Year!

There was recently a sale of various
articles of ladies' apparel on the second
floor of a downtown department store.
A young woman and her grandmother
were rushing to get to the sale before
the best bargains were all gone. They
reached the foot of the escalator going
from the first floor to the second floor
at the same time and stepped on the
first step together. Since they were both
in a hurry to get to the sale, they did
not stand still and ride the escalator up,
but walked up, both at a constant rate,
until they reached the top. The young
lady forgot that her grandmother could
not keep up with her, and walked as
fast as she could. The older woman was
only able to take one step for every three
that her younger companion took. Of
course, when the young woman reached
the top, she had to wait for her grand-
mother, so she didn't gain anything by
her rushing. The granddaughter took
36 steps, her grandmother took 224 steps.
How many steps were in sight at one
time on the moving staircase?
A church hymn board has four grooved
rows on which the numbers of four
hymns chosen for the service are placed:
The hymn book in use contains 700
hymns. What is the smallest number of
number plates, each carrying one digit,
which must be kept in stock so that the
numbers of any four different hymns se-
lected can be displayed; and how will the
result be affected if an inverted 6 can be
used for a 9?
Once upon a time, there lived a rich
farmer who had 30 children, 15 by his
first wife, who was dead, and 15 by his
second wife. The latter woman was eager
that her eldest son should inherit the
property. Accordingly one day, she said
to him, "Dear Husband, you are getting
too old. We ought to settle who shall be
heir. Let us arrange our 30 children in a
circle, and counting from one of them, re-
move every tenth child until there re-
mains but one, who shall succeed to your
estate."
Quite astonished was the old man, as
the first fourteen children eliminated
were by his first wife. Noticing this he
realized that the odds were 15 to 1 that
the latter wife's children would be chosen.
"From this point on" the man suggested
that they count backward from the lone
remaining child from deceased wife.
Which became heir? What order did they
start?
A man is going to make a trip of
27,000 miles. His tires are guaranteed
for 12,000 miles each. What is the least

order to make the trip? Explain.
There are four kegs, all having small
leaks. One fills a mug in hours; another
fills the same mug in 3 hours; another in
4 hours; and the remaining keg fills the
mug in 1/2 hour. If the liquid being lost
from each keg is all funneled into the
same mug, how long will it take to fill
the mug?
The Problem of the Three Philosophers
Worried about their disputations and
oppressed by the summer heat, three
Greek philosophers lay down to take a
little nap under a tree at the Academy. As
they slept, a practical joker smeared their
faces with black paint. Presently they all
woke up at once and began to laugh at
each other. Suddenly, one of them stop-
ped laughing, for he realized that his own
face was painted. What was his reason-
ing?
I have no watch, but I have an excel-
lent clock, which I occasionally forget to
wind. Once when this happened I went
to the house of a friend, passed the eve-
ning in listening to the radio concert pro-
gram, and went back and set my clock.
How could I do this without knowing be-
forehand the length of the trip?
I had 12 bottles of rare old booze in
my cellar (aged over-night) and my wife
told me to empty them down the sink, or
else; this is what happened:
I pulled the cork from the first bottle
and poured the contents down the sink,
with the exception of one glass which I
drank.
I extracted the cork from the second
bottle and did likewise, with the excep-
tion of one glass which I drank.
I then withdrew the cork from the
third bottle and emptied the good old
booze down the sink, except for one glass
which I drank.
I pulled the cork from the fourth
sink, and poured the bottle down the
glass, which I drank. 1 pulled one bottle
from the cork of the next drink and
drank one sink out of it, and poured the
rest down the glass.
I pulled the sink out of the next glass,
and poured the cork down the bottle.
I pulled the next cork out of my
throat and poured the sink down the
bottle and drank the glass.
Then I corked the sink with the glass,
bottled the drink and drank the pour.
When I had everything emptied, I
steadied the house with one hand, count-
ed the bottles and corks which added up
to twenty-nine.
To be sure, I counted them again as
they came by, and this time I had 74.
And as the house came by, I count-
ed them the third time, and finally I had
all the houses, bottles, corks, and glasses,
except one house and one bottle, which
I drank.
It wall all my wife's fault.

By Atomic Radiation
A facility for preserving potatoes for
a year or more by exposing them to atomic
radiation has been designed by University
of Michigan engineers.
The first plant of its kind, it would be
capable of irradiating 250 bushels of po-
tatoes an hour at an estimated cost of six
cents a bushel. It could be built for less
than $50,000 and operated for about
$40,000 a year, including rental of a
radioactive source.
Lloyd E. Brownell, professor of chem-
ical and metallurgical engineering and
supervisor of the University's Fission
Products Laboratory, described the pro-
posed facility in a paper presented No-
vember 29 at a meeting of the American
Society of Refrigerating Engineers in
Philadelphia.
The design was developed under a
contract between the Atomic Energy Com-
mission and the University's Engineering
Research Institute.
"There is no reason why such a facility
could not be constructed in the next
year," Professor Brownell said. "Studies
at Michigan indicate the wholesomeness
of irradiated food, the process makes
good sense economically, and a limited
number of radioactive sources are now
available. A potato-irradiating facility
would make locally-grown potatoes avail-
able all year to individual consumers and
potato processors."
Such a plant would most likely be
built by processors or cooperative farm
groups, Professor Brownell pointed out,
preferably in a northern potato-producing
area near existing or proposed atomic
facilities. Using cooling fuel elements or
radioactive by-products from a nuclear re-
actor as a source of radiation, the plant
could be operated from six to eight
months a year.
Truckloads of potatoes could be dump-
ed on a conveyor belt to be carried on a
ten-minute trip into a thick-walled
chamber, past the source of radiation, and
out again. The dosage they receive serves
to destroy those cells in potatoes that
cause growth. Although comparatively
mild as food treatment doses go, it would
be fatal to man.
The irradiated vegetables could be
Compiled by DICK SCHREIBER
stored at 50 degrees temperature for many
months without fear of their sprouting
or rotting, Professor Brownell indicated.
Non-irradiated potatoes usually sprout
after six months of storage, even at lower
temperatures.
Research at the University of Michigan
and Brookhaven National Laboratories
has proved the preservative value of doses
of radiation. Irradiated potatoes from
the fall crop of 1953, stored at the Uni-
versity, still show no signs of deteriorat-
ing, while untreated tubers from the same
batch have rotted and issued long sprouts.
The process does not harm the pota-
toes, the engineers point out, nor have
over 2,100 taste tests at Michigan given
any indication of resultant off-flavoring.
These tests were sponsored by the Michi-
gan Memorial-Phoenix Project.
Farmers would benefit by the increased
storage life of their crop, for they could
grow more potatoes and sell them
throughout the year. Firms preparing
potato chips or canned or dehydrated
potatoes could use local potatoes during
the full year, as well, without relying on
more expensive shipments from other
parts of the nation between seasons.
A bushel of potatoes can be irradiated
and stored for far less than the shipping
cost of a bushel from southern or far
western states, Professor Brownell noted.
The proposed facility was designed by:
Professor Brownell; J. V. Nehemias, as-
sistant supervisor of the Fission Products
Laboratory; and J. J. Bulmer, a research
assistant.
The plant consists primarily of a rec-
tangular irradiation chamber and an ad-
joining one-story area for a control room
and office. The chamber walls would be
three feet thick and the source suspended
in the middle of the room, above an 18-
foot-deep well of water. When not in use,
the source would be lowered into the well
to permit personnel to enter the chamber.
Potatoes would receive a uniform dose
of radiation during their trip in con-
veyor belt buckets into the chamber at
ceiling height, down beside the source,
underneath it, up the other side and out
of the room.
The U-M engineers have planned for
three possible radioactive sources for the
plant: fuel elements left to "cool off" a
few months after being used in nuclea
reactors; mixed fission products, the ra
dioactive elements created in the reacto
fuel; or Cesium 137, a single, long-live
fission product which can be separate
from the others.
The supply of cooling elements is lirr
ited, Professor Brownell observes, bi
some might be used in the first plant:
GE Develops High Temperature
Aviation Lubricant
Development of what is believed to b
the first silicone lubricant for jet avia
tion and industry—capable of operatin
at temperatures of 400° F. or more-
was announced by General Electric Corr
pany's Silicone Products Department.
Combining the lubricating qualities o
hydrocarbon with the unique properties c
silicones, the new G-E silicone lubricar
was developed to help equipment desigr
ers crack the thermal barrier. Acceleratin
speeds of jet aircraft have created a nee
for suitable lubricants tough enough t
shrug off searing temperatnres.
Dr. Charles E. Reed, general managt
of the department, said that the new sil
cone lubricant resulted from over fi\
years of research investigations at G. E.
silicone laboratories at Waterford, N. ^
He said that the lubricant was especial]
adapted for use in such typical "hot" ii
dustries as glass, steel, ceramics, petr&lt;
leum and aircraft. The lubricant's therm,
operating range is from minus 100 t
over 400° F., according to Dr. Reed.
According to G-E engineers, the ne
G-E fluid and grease lubricate about;
effectively as both the lubricating an
hydraulic types of hydrocarbons. Th&lt;
said that both types of lubricants wi
permit the design of new military and ii
dustrial equipment, hitherto hindere
from operation at high temperatures b
cause of lack of suitable lubrication. Tr
G-E lubricants are also expected to reduc
maintenance costs as well as increase tr
reliability of operating equipment.
Both the lube fluid and grease she
little change in viscosity or consistency i
high temperatures, and are said to resi:
shear breakdown.

THE PERCENTAGE of hydrogen in
liquid hydrocarbons can be determined
by making two simultaneous measure-
ments on the sample to give (1) density
and (2) the absorption rate for beta
rays. The weight percentage of hydro-
gen in the sample is computed from
these measurements and a calibration
curve. The new instrument shown here,
a Standard Oil development, measures
the beta ray absorption rate.
BETA RAY
used to speed hydrogen measurement
The problem: How to measure the percentage of
hydrogen in organic compounds in a short time.
The established process was combustion. It
took about four hours, and so discouraged the
use of hydrogen determinations. But such
analyses are increasingly important. Processes
in the petroleum and chemical industries often
involve hydrogenation or dehydrogenation. In
addition, the percentage of hydrogen is an
index to the performance of critical fuels such
as those used in jet planes.
A rapid method for measuring hydrogen
content would therefore be a great help in
both research work and plant control. Standard
Oil's Engineering Research Department, spe-
cialists in solving technical problems, took on
this challenging assignment.
A new machine—a beta ray hydrogen ana-
lyzer—was invented and constructed. It gives
results in five minutes, and is twice as accu-
rate sis the old combustion method. It is so
easy to operate that a laboratory technician
can use it.
Problems such as this are met continually
in Standard Oil laboratories. They offer an
opportunity for young men with training in
chemistry and engineering to test their knowl-
edge, skill and ingenuity.

THE FIRST SUCCESSFUL HELICOPTER
Just two years before Pearl Harbor, Igor Sikorsky
took the controls of a weird-looking machine —
culmination of a dream of thirty years. Moments
later it rose from the ground. Though the flight
lasted only a few seconds, the VS-300 became the
first practical helicopter in the United States.
Less than six months after Pearl Harbor, the Air

Since then, rapid developments prove that the
helicopter, most versatile of military aircraft, has
tremendous commercial potentials.
Helicopters of the future will be the product of

Freshman Engineering Dance
The Freshman Engineering Class at Michigan is the
greatest! Just ask any freshman engineer, he'll tell you.
Why just the other night we gave a dance for all the
freshman on campus. Some said that the men of Engine
School were 'completely out of it' as far as the social life
was concerned, but we showed them. The dance was held
in the huge ballroom of the Michigan League. And with
Don Kenney and his Orchestra on the stand, the setting
couldn't have been better.
It was called the 'Engine Bounce' and most of the leg
work was done by the Freshman Engineering Council. The
Council, by the way, is made up of nine members elected
from the class at large. Tickets for the affair went at $1 per
couple; pretty reasonable as campus dances go. In keeping
with the preference of the class, the dress was informal;
you know, sport coat and rep tie.
The slide-rule-pushers and their dates seemed to enjoy
themselves as they did everything from the mambo to the
two step, and even the Bunny Hop (all horrors). When
the tempo got a little too fast or the feet a little too sore,
couples retired to the lounge or the Michigan Room for a
coke.
Although the 'Bounce' wasn't a complete financial suc-
cess, all the fellows and gals said they had a terrific time,
and I guess that is all that is really important.

For many years the automotive students
and faculty have labored diligently in
instruction and research in an old lean-to
shed next to the West Engineering An-
nex, which served as the University of
Michigan Automotive Laboratory. How-
ever, in 1953 the Michigan Legislature
saw fit to remedy this situation and ap-
proved an initial expenditure of $72,000
for the development of plans for a new
Automotive Laboratory to be constructed
on the new North Campus.
This dream of a new laboratory is
quickly approaching a reality as this past
fall, the Board of Regents contracted for
the building of this laboratory at an esti-
mated cost of almost $1,800,000. The con-
struction of the new Automotive Labora-
tory is scheduled for completion in the
fall of 1956. When completed, the new
laboratory will provide not only addi-
tional facilities for study on both the
undergraduate and graduate level, but it
will also provide better facilities for the
engineering research being conducted at
the University.
With respect to its geographical loca-
tion, the University of Michigan is cen-
tered in the heart of the largest industry
in the United States, the motor vehicle
manufacturing industry. Presently, one
out of every seven persons in the United
States is employed by some industry that
is either directly or indirectly concerned
with the manufacturing of motor vehicles.
Therefore, vast employment opportunities
are available to the person who has an
education applicable to this industry.
Thus, the new Automotive Laboratory
will provide more opportunity for study
in the fields related to this industry. The
new Automotive Laboratory is another of
the expansion projects on the North
Campus designed to promote better op-
portunities for study to the University of
Michigan students to prepare them more
fully for future employment.
The new laboratory will provide the

darkrooms, located in the partial base-
ment of the building. Also located in the
basement is a shop area, a mechanical
equipment room, and the boiler room.
Individual Classrooms
A special feature of the new Automo-
tive Laboratory is the individual control
rooms provided between each two engine
research and instruction rooms. This setup
will provide the student with a centraliza-
tion of his control equipment, facilitating
easier reading of the instruments which
will provide more accurate data. The con-
trol rooms also provide the student with
maximum protection in case of an equip-
ment failure as each control room is de-
signed with a panel of unbreakable glass
separating it and the engine instruction
and research room.
The newest feature of the laboratory is
the Gas Turbine and Jet Engine instruc-
tion and research room. The present lab-
oratory facilities do not have the proper
exhaust apparatus to handle the high tem-
perature and pressure exhaust connected
with the testing of this type of equipment.
However, the new laboratory is provided
with a special muffling section designed
to handle this problem. Thus, the new
laboratory will be equipped to handle the
most modern advances in the automotive
znd aircraft engines.
One of the bad features of the present
laboratory is the problem of providing
space and equipment for graduate re-
search. Often the facilities which are
needed for graduate research can not be
used for this purpose because they have to
be used for regular undergraduate labora-
tory instruction. However, in the new
laboratory, several rooms are specifically
designated for graduate research. This
will provide an incentive to the under-
graduate to remain for graduate study
rather than depending on "on-the-job"
training for further education.
Road testing of actual motor vehicles
has always been a favorite experiment of
the automotive engineering students. The
new body, chassis, and vehicle laboratory
will provide the students with more op-
portunities to do this type of testing.
Many models of cars and trucks will be
made available to the students to conduct
these actual road tests.
Other rooms such as the fuel metering
room, the engine assembly room where it
will be possible to "tear down" an engine
for examination, computing rooms, and
conference rooms will be available to im-
prove the facilities for instruction of the
student. These improved facilities will
definitely provide an incentive to high
school students to study automotive en-
gineering at the University of Michigan.

obtain pattern surfaces free of shrinkage. Proper feeding of
metal patterns during solidification was assured by immers-
ing only the bottom of the molds.
The transparency of the mold cavities was determined
to be dependent upon the surface finish of the metal pat-
terns. The surfaces of the metal patterns weren't satisfactory
for use as removed from the pattern mold. Consequently,
hind polishing was performed with No. 1, 1/0, 2/0, 3/0,
and 4/0 emery papers respectively if required, followed
by an application of a rubbing compound. A final high
luster was attained with a liquid polish. The ease of polish-
ing external pattern surfaces afforded a great advantge over
the difficulties involved with polishing internal surfaces of
irregularly shaped cavities.
The polished metal patterns and pattern assemblies were
fastened to a metal plate with screws or wax. A thin sheet
of aluminum foil was placed between patterns and the plate.
A flask of glass was built around the patterns and the
interior surfaces of the glass were coated with a silicone
parting agent.
Liquid plastic, a polyester resin, was mixed with the re-
quired amounts or hardener and promoter and then imme-
diately cast into the flask. A sufficient length of time was
allowed for the cast plastic to gel and solidify. Castings
of 76% cubic inches were allowed to cure overnight at
room temperature. Larger castings of 140 cubic inches were
refrigerated for up to five days immediately after casting
»nd then allowed to warm to room temperature for an addi-
tional day. The solidification reactions are exothermic and
large castings, if not refrigerated, fractured due to thermal
stresses caused by overheating during solidification. The
peak temperatures during solidification were also minimized
by maintaining the amounts of hardener and promoter
'dded at a minimum.
The glass flask was separated from the solid plastic and
the plastic was removed from the plate. The cast plastic
mold was then heated slowly to 185°F. and held at that
temperature until the pattern metal had drained from the
cavities. A solution of 50% nitric acid in water was used to
leach the remaining metal films from the cavities and a
50% hydrochloric acid solution was subsequently used to
dissolve any precipitated salts.
If the mold had any damaged or rough exterior mold
surfaces, they were polished to the desired transparency
using the same technique described for preparation of the
metal patterns. The mold was then ready for assembly into
the completed model for an examination of the fluid flow.
Fluid flow in the cast transparent plastic turbine blade
molds was studied in a manner similar to that used to study
the casting characteristics of the test bar molds. The roll
over rates were slowed down and the ingates enlarged to
provide non-turbulent flow but the films again indicated
that entrapped air in the runner system was resulting in
voids in the cast buckets. The runner system was changed
in an effort to eliminate the trapped air. The runners were
arranged to point away from the downsprue at an angle of
45° rather than being perpendicular to the main runner.
Figure 5 shows the two gating configurations and the ab-
sence of trapped air bubbles in the herringbone type ar-
rangement. The new gating system was put into production
and scrap rates immediately dropped.
The value of the development is twofold. Transparent
plastic molds represent an economy measure for the foundry
industry. The most suitable mold configuration for produc-
ing a given casting may be determined without the added

• "Worthington was my choice," Mr. Berger says, "be-
cause of the excellent training and the unusual experiences
that are possible with a manufacturer having a worldwide
reputation, and worldwide distribution. Then, when a
company has seventeen divisions, including air condition-

power transmission equipment, a graduate engineer's
chances for getting into his chosen field are even better.
"Supporting these divisions are research, engineering,

The real opportunity, however, is in Worthington itself.
This is a company that is growing, just as it has for more
than a century. It is always looking for new, related
products and good men to engineer, produce, and sell
them—at home and abroad.
"I began my career with Worthington's training pro-

How to beat shock loads
in a big dragline
Imagine the shock loads put on this big dragline's
intermediate swing shaft when the cab, the boom
and an 8-yard load of dirt being swung through the
air are suddenly stopped and the direction reversed!
Engineers solved this problem by specifying
Timken® tapered roller bearings. Timken bearings
not only take radial and thrust loads in any combi-
nation, they also assure long, trouble-free operation.
Why TIMKEN8 bearings have
high load capacity
This cross section of a Timken tapered roller bearing
illustrates one reason why Timken bearings do such a good
job under heavy load conditions. Notice that there is full
line contact between the rollers and races. It's this full line
contact that distributes the load over a wider area, gives
Timken bearings their extra load-carrying capacity.

ested in engineering would do well to take as much math,
English and science as possible. Then, at the University's
College of Engineering, all students are for the first year
enrolled in the same subjects. After the first year the stu-
dent indicates the field in which he expects to practice and
is then enrolled in the appropriate program. Each program
leading to a Bachelor of Science in Engineering is de-
signed to be completed in four years. The programs are so
arranged that the first third deals with basic scientific prin-
ciples involved in engineering, with the latter portion
primarily concerned with the professional use of these
principles in the various aspects of engineering.
In carrying out this program, the College of Engineering
at the University of Michigan depends not only on its own
resources but it draws also upon the facilities and the pro-
grams of the University as a whole. The engineering stu-
dent at Michigan finds himself not in a narrow atmosphere
of complete concern with technical instruction: he is in-
stead a part of a great institution of learning where he may
take advantage of a wide range of extra-curricular activities,
in addition to studies in other professional fields, such as
business administration or the arts. His associations with
fellow students put him in touch with a wide variety of
interests and occupations, and these serve to broaden his
own interests and understanding.

faculty with completely equipped laboratories and an excel-
lent library. Most of the classes in engineering at the Uni-
versity of Michigan are quite small, permitting individual
attention to students' questions and problems.
The College encourages its faculty members to maintain
their own contact with engineering practice through occa-
sional periods of professional employment. Likewise the
College of Engineering, through "co-op" programs with
several industries, encourages those students who so wish
to gain actual industrial experience while they learn.
Research is an important function of the College of Engi-
neering and the faculty of the College is engaged in a large
number of research projects sponsored by industry and the
government, in which are employed a considerable number
of advanced students. The Engineering Research Institute,
for example, has at present a total of over S5 million per
year contracted for research.
As of now, the College of Engineering of the University
of Michigan offers excellent undergraduate and graduate
programs in the following kinds of engineering: Aeronauti-
cal engineering, chemical engineering, civil engineering,
electrical engineering mechanics, industrial engineering,
materials, engineering mathematics, mechanical engineering,
metallurgical engineering, naval architecture and marine
engineering, and engineering mechanics.
Information regarding the aforementioned kinds of en-
gineering may be obtained from the College of Engineering,

The engineer occupies an enviable position in society. He
enjoys prestige, security, and an excellent return for his
services, for modern civilization finds these services indi^-
pensible. But important as financial success is, many people
will willingly forsake it for creative activity. The writers,
artists, philosophers, etc., who traditionally exist on a.
meager subsistance are presumed to do so to be able to
devote their full time to the expression of their creative
urges. Even to those who are not willing to give up the ma-
terial advantages of a good income will usually admit that
a great deal of satisfaction can be had in the exercise of their
creative abilities. The present popularity of the "do-it-your-
self" attitude is, among other things, a large scale example
of the value of individual creativity.
Fortunately, however, it is not always necessary to make
a choice between three meals a day or full time creativitr.
There do exist a fortunate few who are paid to be creative,
and paid well. For these people, the continual challenge of
converting the inexplicable to the understandable is a re-
ward in itself, but is accompanied by the means to a high
personal living standard. To this group belong many engi-
neers, scientists, writers, artists, and administrators. Our
civilization is largely dependent upon their leadership.
In the present world-wide struggle to avoid mutual an-
nihilation, engineers are needed as never before to diminish
differences in living standards. In a more immediate sense.
America needs more engineers to aid in the defense agaioss
those who would prefer the easy way to equalize living
standards.
To those who can respond the engineering profession ex-
tends an invitation to creativity.

FACULTY EVALUATION
At one of their monthly meetings last fall, the Engi-
neering Council set up a committee to investigate the pos-
sibility of restoring a system of faculty evaluation to the
Engineering College. For many years Tau Beta Pi conduct-
ed such a faculty evaluation program, but waning interest
in the project over the past few years caused Tau Beta Pi
to drop it. To many people this seemed too bad; admit-
tedly the evaluation forms were not perfect and the admin-
istration of the project was a headache, but it seemed to
many people that student analysis of instructors was a
good thing. If taken seriously by students and faculty it
held many benefits for both.
This idea of student evaluation of the faculty is not
new; there have been various systems in operation in the
College, although somewhat spasmodically, since the early
twenties. However, all have run up against most of the same
difficulties and suffered many of the same faults of the
recent Tau Beta Pi project. Any new system which is set
up must be prepared to meet these same difficulties and
avoid these same errors.
In 1952 a faculty committee in Lit. school prepared a
report reviewing their system of faculty evaluation and
brought out many points which would be pertinent to any
system set up in the Engineering School.
They felt that student evaluation of the faculty might
serve two main purposes: (1) Aiding instructors in im-
proving teacher methods and course offerings, and (2)
aiding administrators in matters of salary increase and pro-
motion of faculty members.
Under the first heading it was found that student opinion,
if properly gathered and used, was quite valuable. Annoy-
ing mannerisms of an instructor, the quality of his voice,
his preparation and presentation of the subject matter, the
level at which he pitches his instruction, whether he stimu-
lates thought or squelches it—all are points which student
questionnaires can bring out. In addition, some teachers
have been found particularly effective in survey courses,
others in more advanced courses; student opinion may point
this out as well. Finally, the very fact that students are
given a chance to express their opinions gives a decided
boost to student morale. Most students feel their views
have value and an opportunity to express them is usually
well received.
On the other hand, use of student opinion ratings as an
aid to administrative handling of instructors has met with
many strong objections. In the first place, in order to ob-
tain comparative ratings for instructors it is necessary to
process the evaluation forms statistically, and this in turn
requires use of a form in which instructors are rated nu-
merically on various pertinent qualities. The validity of
such ratings is open to question; teaching is an extremely
complex thing and no one has yet discovered a single set of
qualities which can distinguish a good teacher from a bad
one. Also the fact that these forms demand numerical (or
alphabetical) evaluation is an invitation to superficial and
unthinking judgments. Then too, the very sort of ques-
tionnaire which is most helpful to improvement of teaching
methods, the short-answer or guided-essay type of form, is
unmanageable by statistical methods and could not be used
to obtain a specific rating. As a result it was felt that use of
student opinion by the administration was unjustified and
that questionnaires should be planned so as to give aid to
the individual instructors.
A number of faculty men have expressed doubt as to the
worth of any student opinion polls; they feel that a student
is in no position to judge whether the material in a course
is covered adequately or whether the most important points
are emphasized or whether the text is sufficient for the
course. In particular, they cite the presumptuousness of a
student organization setting up a criteria for judging their
instructors. These criticisms are not without merit and they
point out one of the most serious faults of the old Tau
Beta Pi questionnaires. This trouble has been largely
avoided in the Lit. school by having a faculty committee
prepare the questionnaires and conduct the evaluation.
This is the logical course for the Engineering College to
follow and would, beyond doubt, give more meaning to
the evaluation both from the instructors' and the students'
viewpoint.
In brief, this is what I would like to propose: First, that
the Engineering Council submit a series of recommenda-
tions to the College faculty pointing out the desirability
of faculty evaluation and urging the formation of a fac-
ulty committee (or a joint student-faculty committee) to
design and administer an evaluation questionnaire; second,
that such a questionnaire be aimed at improving class-
room instruction and course offerings; and third, that
completed questionnaires be read only by the instructors
concerned, thus eliminating any administrative use of the
evaluations.
By so narrowly limiting the evaluation many possible ad-
vantages may be lost, e.g. use in placing an instructor to the
best advantage, but, on the other hand, such limitations are
necessary if the questionnaires are to have the most meaning
for the individual instructor.
Student evaluation of the faculty can be very valuable to
students as well as faculty men. Adoption of some pro-
gram seems entirely justified and the Engineering Council
should receive considerable praise if they can pressure such
a program into being.

representatives in March of 1948. After
receiving his B.S. in Chemical Engineering
in June, he chose his U.S. Steel offer over
several other job offers and began working
at the huge Gary Works as a Foreman
Relief Trainee. He gained experience in
the Blast Furnace Department and in the
front office learning the business end as
well. In November of 1954 Mr. Wilson was
made assistant to the superintendent of
blast furnaces at Gary. His duties now in-
clude developing data for control of pro-
duction, quality of materials, costs, and
making technical reports. In addition, he
directs the activities of Technological Co-
ordinators and part of the training of
management trainees.
Mr. Wilson is naturally pleased with his
progress at U.S. Steel and he feels that
U.S. Steel offers qualified and ambitious
engineers the very best in three important
areas—opportunity, security and an inter-
esting job.
He says, "Opportunity is unlimited at
U.S. Steel and openings for advancement
are frequent." In addition, Mr. Wilson
feels that U.S. Steel affords a secure future
because of the basic nature of the steel in-
dustry and the constant need for engineering
talent. But most important, Mr. Wilson is
deeply interested in his job because he
knows he is really playing a vital role in a
vital business. And he says, "The steel in-
dustry has many facets and is constantly

RESEARCH LABORATORY
The technology of guided missiles poses increasingly complex
problems in virtually every field of science.
To provide physicists and engineers with the most modern
facilities for meeting those problems, Lockheed
Missile Systems Division has begun construction on a
laboratory for advanced research—first step
in a $10,000,000 research laboratory program.
Scheduled for occupation in early fall of 1955, it will augment
existing Missile Systems Division facilities.
Individuals able to make significant contributions to the technology
of guided missiles are invited to contact their placement officer or write us.

To help develop Sta-Clean for Standard Furnace Oil, the testing apparatus
shown here was constructed. Running an experiment on the improved oil
is Dr. Jack A. Williams, a chemist at Standard Oil's Whiting laboratories.
HOW TO SOLVE A BURNING PROBLEM!
Scientists in Standard Oil laboratories work with
the stimulating knowledge that practical and val-
uable results will be obtained from their discoveries.
A recent achievement of Standard Oil scientists is
now benefiting hundreds of thousands of Standard
Furnace Oil users throughout the Midwest.
In 1952 our research people undertook the prob-
lem of finding a method to eliminate oil burner fail-
ure or inefficiency arising from clogged filters and
burner nozzles.
After months of painstaking laboratory work and
many more months of thorough field testing through-
out an entire heating season, Standard Oil scientists
perfected a new, efficient additive—Sta-Clean.
Blended into our furnace oil, the new additive acts
as a detergent, sludge inhibitor and rust stopper—
all in one. Sta-Clean assures clean oil filters and
nozzles—a dramatic contribution to efficient and
economical heating.
The development of this remarkable new additive
is further proof of the progress possible when scien-
tists are given time and equipment to explore and
develop thoroughly their ideas. Young scientists
find such an atmosphere inspiring.

Generally credited with having origin-
Med the word "automation,'' D. S. Harder
has pioneered the application of this new
manufacturing method to automotive pro-
duction. His development of automatic
bundling of parts between progressive
production processes is regarded as the
major innovation of the past decade in
automoth e manufacturing.
As Ford Motor Company's vice presi-
dent—manufacturing, he has played a key
role in the expansion and modernization
program which has given the Company,
since 1943, more than 38,700,000 square
feet of additional space in 13 new manu-
facturing plants, seven new assembly
plants and various other facilities.
What Is Automation?
The first order of business is to define
what we are talking about.
As you know, automation has become a
"catch-phrase" used to describe almost
everything that is automatic. The "huck-
sters" appear to like the sound of the
word.
During the early development period
of automation at Ford, we derived our
own working definition. We had to do
this to be able to talk with engineers, ma-
chine tool builders and others about the
objectives of our program. Initially, we
stated:
"Automation is the automatic han-
dling of parts between progressive
production processes."
That sounds so clear and concise. We
soon found out, however, that this was
not the case. The complex problems hid-
den behind those simple words were of
major proportion. While our early defini-
tion is still substantially correct, I feel
that it should be broadened considerably.
I clipped an excellent definition from
the February, 1954, issue of "Production"
magazine. The author is Mr. W. E.
Brainard of the Hughes Aircraft Com-
pany. It reads as follows:
At left—This Le Blond crankshaft lathe
located in the Cleveland Engine Plant
of the Ford Motor Co., has attached to
it an automatic loading and unloading
device, still another application of auto-
mation in a major industry.

Vice-President—Manufacturing

"Automation is more than merely
transferring. Nor is it a push button
factory. It is a philosophy that may
extend back to the design of the
product. It is a new method of manu-
facture, not necessarily a new way of
cutting metal, but a way of controll-
ing the various processes. Automa-
tion is a philosophy of design, it is
a manufacturing method, and it is
control within a machine."
I like this particular definition because
"automation" is labeled as a new manu-
facturing method. This, I believe, is true.
There are many other definitions equally
as acceptable, but anyone who fails to
recognize that one fact has missed the
point.
I am deeply disturbed when I hear
short-sighted groups running down and
damning this new manufacturing innova-
tion. You have all read comments by the
"prophets of doom" pegging it as the
cause of vast future unemployment and
labor dislocation. The same type of people
have ridiculed every significant improve-
ment in the production process since the
start of the industrial revolution. Gentle-
men, they just don't know what they are
talking about.
I for one, want to think of automation
as a new concept—a new philosophy—of
manufacturing. If you will begin think-
ing in these terms, others will soon under-
stand the true meaning. Its future value
to our economic system is based on our
ability to understand the potentials and
harness them.
Why Has Automation Become So
Important?
Now that we have defined what we
are talking about, let us examine our
subject to see if it has substance. We cer-
tainly would not want to support some
unsound idea which might be slated for
failure due to lack of economic contribu-
tion.
There are many reasons why automation
is important to American industry. Of
these, I have selected three which I be-
lieve are the most outstanding:
First, It is a logical step forward in
the improvement of the pro-
duction process
Second, It is an economic necessity, and
Third, It has important social value.
The machine tool and the cutting tool
industries have made great strides for-
ward in producing equipment and tools
capable of rapid production of parts. We
now have machines capable of turning out
parts at a much more rapid rate than
they actually are doing. The speed of
some of these machines is beyond the
ability of man to supply them with ma-
terials and to remove their finished prod-
ucts fast enough.
Automation, in at least one of its as-
pects, fills this void. Devices can be made
to enable a machine to attain its designed
production rate. In addition, production
processes can be tied together so that the
output of entire groups of machines may
be increased. Carried to the extreme, it
could lead to the much discussed 'auto-
matic factory." I would like to emphasize
at this time that the "automatic factory"
depends upon so many other considera-
tions that its existence is far in the fu-
ture^—if it ever can be achieved.
It should be clear that this new tech-
nique is a necessary and logical step in
the advancement of our highly complex
production system. Without it, we might
have reached the point where our increase
in productivity would begin to level off—
perhaps even start on the decline.
I realize that it is very basic to state
that increasing productivity of labor is
essential to an increase in the standard
of living. We have all heard this thous-
ands of times, but we sometimes lost sight
of the fact. Labor productivity has been
increasing steadily during the last fifty
years through the use of modern ma-
chines and equipment. If this increase is
to be continued, it will be necessary for
machines to produce faster and more
efficiently. If we are to increase our
standard of living to higher and higher
levels, we must find a means by which
we can magnify our ability to produce
goods and services.
Automation is a vital steppingstone to
the expansion of our economy. It has the
ability to tie production processes to-
gether and to enable labor to gain the
most from machines. Extensive use of

"What will I do after graduation?"
"What is industry like?"
"Would I like to work for industry?"
"What will happen when I put my
book-learning to the test?"
"What courses should I take next year
that will aid me in my career?"
Take a bull session among upperclass-
men—you'll always find such questions.
They're pretty universal and highly im-
portant. This article can't answer them,
but it will tell you how two University
of Michigan students—Bob Schumann
and Lew Burnham—had an opportunity
to find answers for themselves.
They participated in an entirely new
career survey program held in Cincinnati
late last August—Proctor &amp; Gamble's
Summer Workshop, a unique plan which
allows qualified college men to survey
career opportunities in industry during an
intensive two-week session.
Why would one of the nation's larg-
est chemical processors spend money and
time on a plan essentially designed to aid
men still in college? Trained men are
needed in industry. They're important.
But training isn't the only thing. The in-
dividual himself should be happy in his
work, suited for the job.
A few individuals in any profession
find they're headed the wrong way. Some
engineers become auditors, some journal-
ists end up being professors. And some
technically trained people aren't in in-
dustry simply because they know nothing
about it. Industry is looking for men
who know what they want, what they like,
what they will be doing when they are
hired.
Proctor &amp; Gamble Co.
Bob Schumann, right, helps Jan Krebs of Johns Hopkins University, fix a movie
projector prior to a seminar during Proctor &amp; Gamble's Summer Workshop. During
the seminar the projector would be used to help illustrate problems and solutions
the Workshoppers had been studying.
Career surveys can help students make
these decisions. They can help men pick
the right job. They can help industry
get the right men.
In making plans for its Summer Work-
shop, Proctor &amp; Gamble carefully sur-
veyed applicants from 48 top colleges and
universities before choosing Bob, Lew
and 43 others. These outstanding stu-
dents represented 20 schools.
In this program Bob and Lew had a
chance to examine several possible careers
in industry. Through personal experience,
two weeks of actual work, and through
discussions with supervisors and fellow
Workshop members, the two students
could come closer to conclusions as to
whether they liked or were fitted for a
certain type of career. They also got their
chance to put "book-learning" to the test.
Workshop members were organized
into four groups: engineering, research
and development, industrial engineering
and factory supervision, each under the
leadership of one of Proctor &amp; Gamble's
technical management personnel. Bob was
in the industrial engineering group under
the supervision of Mr. Hugh Brandt, as-
sociate director of industrial engineering.
Lew was in the engineering group, and
had Mr. James Edwards, head of P &amp; G's
mechanical equipment design department,
as his supervisor.
The groups worked separately accord-
ing to the interests and college training
of the members. Bob and Lew were first
briefly oriented on the Company's work
and products. Then, instead of lectures or
school room sessions, the Michigan stu-
dents went directly into the factories and
laboratories for first-hand observation and
experience. Problems actually confronting
different Company departments were
worked on and quite often the Workshop
members found solutions that were ac-
ceptable to the Company.
Bob studied and submitted recommen-
dations on the floor loading at Proctor &amp;
Gamble's St. Bernard, Ohio, factory. He
wanted to determine the maximum weight
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


the floor would actually support for safety
purposes and for the necessary specifica-
tions in the designing of new machinery
to be placed on the floor.
Lew spent part of his time studying
methods to improve the speed of case
packing, the process of placing product
cartons into a case ready for shipment.
The speed here limits the pace on the
rest of the production line.
Following the completion of each prob-
lem. Lew and Bob attended a seminar
where the results were presented. Reports
of all Workshop members were discussed,
giving everyone the over-all picture of the
Company's engineering and technical
operations.
At the end of two weeks the Michigan
Workshop participants knew what the in-
side of a factory looked like. They knew
the type of people that worked in them.
They knew the day-by-day problems they
would face should they choose a particu-
lar career in industry. They knew the
over-all problems, the long-range plans.
They knew whether they could apply the
things learned in the classroom to actual
work. They knew whether they enjoyed
their work.
In short, each man had a bird's-eye
view of what could be in store for him.
If he liked what he saw, he was ready to
continue his education with confidence
and a goal. And, he knew what subjects
could help the most. All this, not because
he had been told it, but because he found
out himself by actual work.
On the last day of the Workshop a
luncheon was held for Bob, Lew and the
others. Mr. J. G. Pleasants, Proctor &amp;
Gamble's Vice President in charge of re-
search and development, discussed the
long-range improvements in Company
operations which have resulted from re-
search and development.
Transportation was paid both to and
from the training site of Cincinnati. Once
in the "Queen City" Bob and Lew were
housed with the other Workshop repre-
sentatives in University of Cincinnati's
new French Hall. The Michigan students
worked a regular eight-hour day, 40-hour
week, and were paid a regular salary for
their participation in the program.
Incidentally, Bob and Lew had plenty
of time to see Cincinnati. The evenings
and week ends belonged to them. Sports,
amusement places, historic points, and
other things to see and do were available.
Bob, from Huntington Woods, Michi-
gan, will receive his Master's Degree in
Business Administration next June. He is
a member of Alpha Tau Omega. Lew,
Port Lambton, Ontario, Canada, will re-
ceive his B.M.E. next June. A member of
the American Society for Mechanical
Engineers, Lew belongs to Pi Tau Sigma
and Tau Beta Pi.
Workshoppers for next summer's pro-
gram must be within a year of receiv-
ing their bachelor or master's degree
and should be interested in a possible
career in either management, or research
and development. The Workshop is open
to students of chemical, mechanical, elec-
trical, general and industrial engineering
and chemistry.
General consensus of opinion concern-
ing results of the new career survey pro-
gram was good, both on the part of man-
agement and the participating students.
And hopes are high that as the present
school year progresses the Workshop par-
ticipants will find that they have found
their individual answers to the original
questions.

production line.

In beginning an article of this nature,
an analysis of why the topic is to be
considered is of primary importance. A
casual engineer might doubt the influence
of casting and the foundry on his future
career. The fundry industry, however, is
one of the most basic industries. Few
realize that there are over 5,000 foun-
dries in the U.S. or that they employ
nearly 500,000 people. They don't realize
that castings are used as end products or
components of 90% of all durable goods.
It is interesting to note that there are in
excess of 2,000 supervisors, engineers, or
others in the management group who
leave the industry every year through re-
tirement, death, or for other reasons.
"This may all be well and good but
it doesn't apply to me" can be heard from
the aeronautical engineer. Granted that the
aero will probably be far away from the
foundry at his design board, knowledge
of the different processes of manufactur-
ing still will be invaluable to his efforts.
And, of course ,one of the most economi-
cal and flexible manufacturing processes
is casting.
"Of no use whatsoever" says the Chem-
ical engineer. Of course, if the chem man
stays away from plastics, he may have a
point. Ever think of all those plastic items
that are seen everywhere? Most of them
are cast. It never hurts to have some
knowledge in another field of engineer-
ing, does it?
Industrial engineers will find a very
fertile field for methods study in the cast
metals industry which is in a state of flux
due to the replacement of old, established,
and somewhat venerable methods of the
past with modern, efficient, and labor sav-
ing methods. Due to the small size of the
average plant, the industrial engineer will
have a good test of his ingenuity and re-
sourcefulness to install the latest methods
with a minimum of capital expenditures.
Even if he doesn't work in this industry,
the efficiency expert should be able to
recognize applications of castings to sup-
plement or replace other methods of man-
ufacture. After a course in casting, he will
realize that machining can be eliminated
on a production basis since cast tolerances
of .001 inch per inch can be maintained.
The Mechanical engineer will be quite
at home in the maze of machinery need-
ed in a modern foundry. Agan due to the
small individual size of the average shop,
a man with a broad, practical knowledge
of many fields is needed. If he prefers to
specialize, there are larger plants with as
many as 1000 employees.
A knowledge of casting is as basic to
the Metallurgical engineer as statics is to
the civil or aero. All metal products orig-
inate as castings such as the ingots cast
for rolled steel as well as sand castings.
The casting method is often the simplest
and most economical method of obtain-
ing the desired metal structure in the
required shape. The full knowledge of
the metallurgist in the field of liquid as
well as solid metals is applied here.
Using the full-time efforts of four of
the faculty, the University of Michigan
endeavors to acquaint students from all
of these fields with the foundry and gives
advanced courses to those interested in
further study. The cast metals program
has been balanced with three objectives
in mind—teaching, research, and profes-
sional development.
Instruction at the University is offered
at two levels, and individual research
problems, including the Ph.D. thesis, are
available. The elementary courses involve
about 200 students per year. The re-
search courses vary according to the stu-
dent from problems requiring six hours
a week to full-time doctoral research.
Research produces the new blood of any
industry. The new methods of casting by
shell and investment molding, the new
alloys such as ductile iron, heat and cor-
rosion resistant steels, and the light-
weight aluminum and magnesium struc-
tures are typical examples. The main em-
phasis at Michigan is on melting, includ-
ing the reaction in the different melting
furnaces, stag-metal-gas equilibria, and
the effects of ladle treatment on subse-
quent solidification mechanisms. Work
on melting metals in vacuum and under
protective atmosphere is well under way.
The engineer in industry often must
shelve new ideas in favor of more press-
ing problems, but the academic group can
explore these ideas without restriction. To

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


accelerate a process of cross fertilization,
a program of close co-operation with in-
dustry has been embarked upon. Examples
are the special summer course for indus-
trial personnel and the regional foundry
conferences at which students, faculty,
and industry exchange information and
knowledge. Another example of this co-
operation is the rebuilding of the cast
metals laboratory with the assistance of
the local Foundry Educational Foundation
Advisory Committee.
As shown in the accompanying layout,
development with the aid of Giffels and
Vallet, Inc., Detroit, the laboratory has
been designed with both formal teaching
and research in mind. The equipment for
the unit operations of melting, molding,
and finishing has been consolidated. Sand
flows in a straight line from the bins to
the mixers, then to the molding stations,
and finally to pouring and shakeout and
return. The metal handling progresses
from the melting area to pouring, shake-
out, cleaning and inspection. This ar-
rangement has resulted in freeing a large
bay for research—on a pilot scale—in new
methods. In addition there is a separate
room used for instruction and also for
research on vacuum melting and invest-
ment casting.
If one were to follow the progress of a
typical casting through the foundry, he
would probably start with the mold which
means sand. The sand is mixed with
water, other sands, and additives in one
of the two mullers available. After the
sand is mixed it is moved to the molding
area on an overhead monorail system.
Different molding aids such as a "handy
sandy" (a device which eliminates much
of the manual handling of sand) are
available and are demonstrated to and
are used by the students. Different types
of molding machines are also used by the
students and the particular advantages
of each machine are brought out. Even
hand or bench molding is used since
this is the only practical method to use
for some items with limited production-
shell molding, which uses a different type
of sand, is also available for use by the
students.
After the mold is completed, it is
placed in the pouring area near the fur-
naces. There are five different furnaces
available and a sixth is being built. The
most frequently used furnaces are the two
induction furnaces which each hold ap-
proximately 100 pounds of metal. These
furnaces are very convenient as they can
melt any type of metal quickly and in
comparatively small amounts. Another
useful furnace is the small induction fur-
nace used for melting aluminum. The
Detroit arc furnace, which gives the stu-
dents an example of melting practices as
used in industry, does its melting by the
heat of an arc and is used for iron in
batches of about 250 pounds. The last of
the furnaces now available is the very
simple, very reliable, and economical
cupola. Due to the method of melting
(alternative layers of metal, coke, and
linestone repeated throughout the fur-
nace) only higher carbon melts may be
made but it is far cheaper than any other
type of furnace. Since the cupola is a con-
tinuous furnace—that is raw materials are
added throughout the melting unlike other
types of furnaces—the cupola at Michigan
is run near the end of the semester when
the castings for the machine shops are
made. Each run consists of approximately
2000 pounds and each class section par-
ticipates in one run.
After the castings arc poured from hand
ladles, they are allowed to cool before
shaking them out. Then, after the sand-
blasting them, one of the cutoff wheels is
employed to remove the risers and gates.
If the castings are to be cut up for samples
and inspection (as they usually are since
students like to see the interior defects
with their own eyes) the cutoff wheels
and grinding wheels are closely adjacent.
More detailed inspection takes place in
some of the auxiliary areas. If microspeci-
mens are desired for structure inspection,
complete facilities are available in the
micrography room.
After completing the elementary
course P.E. 11 more specialized ones are
available. For example, one P.E. 113, lets
the student work with the faculty on a
research project for approximately 6 hours
a week for 3 hours of credit. A project
might be concerned with eliminating the
machining of tappets by using the shell
molding process or it might delve into
the possibility of making auto turbine
blades by investment molding. Other ad-
vanced courses are also available.
Other facets of the foundry at the Uni-
versity of Michigan include the student
chapter of the American Foundryman's
Society which has speakers and sponsors
field trips and University-industry con-
ferences as well as activities of a more-
social nature. Another facet is the Foun-
dry Educational Foundation. The foundry
industry as a whole, realizing the need
for more technical personnel, has set up
the F.E.F. to interest the student in the
industry. As aids in that direction it has
set up several scholarships for students
interested in the field and also tries to
place students in summer jobs in the in-
dustry.
A course in the foundry is well worth
your while. The line forms to the right!

few years, editorially, mean four or five?)
with a high-priced, very limited produc-
tion model in their Custom Imperial line;
GM turbine-powered busses and trucks
will be commercially available about the
same time, and dark-horse Ford may hold
back somewhat longer so that they can be
first with a popular-priced version.
We have solid and current reasons for
these predictions, but first let's analyze
why all three companies are willing
though not quite ready to scrap millions
of dollars' worth of tooling now tied up
in conventional piston engines. Both these
and turbine compress air, burn fuel in it,
and utilize the expansion of the resulting
gases to dd the work. The Otto cycle en-
gine which you now have pumps you
jerkily down the highway with one power
impulse to every four strokes of the pis-
ton. It seems smooth in operation only be-
cause there are a multiple number of pis-
tons and a big flywheel to take up the
slack. The turbine, on the other hand,
does this work on a continuous cycle;
there is no problem of reducing irregular,
vertical power impulses to rotary motion.
Sounds good. It's almost enough in it-
self to make all of us want to own a
turbine-powered car as soon as they be-
come available. It is the basic reason for
the superior smoothness of operation (and
quietness inside) which is only hinted at
in designer George Huebner's descrip-
tion of the first trial of the Chrysler tur-
bine installation:
"When we (Chrysler engineer Bill
Chapman and I) first climbed into the
Plymouth that was ordinary looking on
the outside but very special inside, we
didn't know quite what to expect. The
engine, of course, had been run success-
fully many hours on a dynamometer. But
here was the complete car, out of its secret
garage and in the light of day for the first
time. Nine years of engineering effort was
at stake.
"A crowd of fellow employees soon
gathered in the parking lot area behind
Chrysler's big Central Engineering Office
building. I turned the key and found the
tachometer was hooked up backwards.
Minutes were spent reversing the leads.
Key again and pressed the starter button.
"The starter motor wound up—some-
thing was wrong because it made a terrific
racket—to 14,000 rpm. I released the but-
ton. The turbine should be running but
there was dead silence inside the car. I
looked at Chapman. He was grinning at
his instruments—operating temperatures
and turbine rpm were normal for fast
idle.
"Outside, the crowd went wild—danc-
ing up and down and holding their hands
in front of the tailpipe. They must have
had a lot of faith in our theoretical calcu-
lations to do this, but fortunately the ex-
haust was cool as we expected it would
be.
"We hadn't really planned to drive the
car in this cramped area but we couldn't
resist it. I released the parking brake, put
the shift lever in its single forward speed
position, and gently accelerated the tur-
bine. For a long second, we didn't move
but this was due to the inherent initial
lag of any turbine—the rpm range is 10
times that of a piston engine and it takes
a while to get up to speeds where it will
do work.
"We moved forward with unbelievable
smoothness. It was then that I first sensed
the tremendous acceleration potential of
this engine, especially since we had noth-
ing but the equivalent of ordinary high
gear. Needless to say, we promptly pro-
ceeded to violate the 10 mph speed limit
in the parking lot area, but our biggest
thrill came from the spontaneous cheer
which arose from the crowd when the car
pulled away. Some of them wouldn't be-
liece it was really running until that mo-
ment . . ."
The point which finally clinches the
sales argument is the simplicity of the tur-
bine. By this, we mean almost five times
fewer moving parts, but not, necessarily,
greater ease of manufacture. There is real-
ly no such thing as a turbine tune-up. It
either runs well or you need a complete
overhaul; it's also comparatively simple
because of the few parts subject to wear.
While no one yet envisions turbines
being more economical than piston en-
gines, the whirlybird will happily digest
any hydrocarbon fuel that can stay liquid
in the winter. This rules out tar but not
much else. Oil problems, too, are mini-
mized. Only the bearings and accessories
drive train require lubrication and these
are located in relatively cool areas.
Since turbines are as old as a pre-
Christian Greek named Hero of Alex-
andria, it would seem on the surface that
Detroit has been sitting on a good and
simple principle. In a sense, we suppose
Detroit has, but it's only because turbines,
up until World War II, were elephantine
affairs that were barely agile enough to
keep themselves going, much less accom-
plish any useful work. The reason was,
and in many instances still is, their very
low thermal efficiency. This has its techni-
cal definition, but is most easily under-
stood as the ratio between what an engine
does and what it theoretically could do.
Just to create an argument, we might
say that the greater handicap to gas tur-
bine development to date has been the
emphasis on its application to military
aircraft. With governments footing the
fuel bill, there has been a tendency to-
wards bigger gas tanks rather than higher
thermal efficiency. One exception was a
Navy contract once held by Chrysler. This
called for the development of a practical
regenerative gas turbine for aircraft. Al-
though the project was cancelled (Con-
gressional ideas of economy violate all
laws of physics), Chrysler fortunately had
the courage and vision to continue experi-
ments on their own.
Regeneration in a turbine is simply
scounging most of the normally wasted
energy of heated exhaust gases and putting
it back to work. Every bit you salvage
increases thermal efficiency and therefore
economy.
Like the turbine itself, there is nothing
new about a heat exchanger, the mecha-

nism which accomplishes regeneration.
The catch can be found in any physics
text. These say that a given amount of
heat is most effectively exchanged over the
greatest possible area. Sharp differences in
temperature are relatively easy to equalize
(exchange), but as the gradient narrows,
you really need the large area. Heretofore,
experimental heat exchangers capable of
usefully absorbing the output of a gas tur-
bine worthy of the name were big, so big
that even relatively small automotive ver-
sions would easily displace all passengers
(except, we hope, the driver) in a con-
ventional car.
GM, Rover, Fiat, and others must have
considered attaching a heat exchanger to
their turbines because they understand the
laws of physics as well as anyone. Their
current failure to do so could be attributed
to two factors: (1) they tried but were
unable to achieve more than 70 per cent
regeneration (the theoretical useful mini-
mum) without great bulk; or (2) their
thinking is such as to limit the turbine to
commercial (truck or bus) applications,
where predominantly full-throttle opera-
tion makes economy a secondary consider-
ation to power.
The latter of the above two reasons falls
flat on its face because a heat exchanger
robs very little power from the turbine,
and maximum economy without sacrifice
of design power is desirable in any instal-
lation, no matter where.
The inevitable conclusion is that the
first reason is the valid one, and that these
early and already obsolete turbines were
introduced (perhaps prematurely) pri-
marily for their publicity value to the
companies concerned. We do not mean to
detract. All deserve great credit for pio-
neering a new field, especially Rover, who
won the coveted Dewar Trophy for being
first of all.
Nevertheless, Chrysler stands alone.
Their outstanding achievement is stuffing
a turbine plus a practical heat exchanger
under the hood of a production model
Plymouth Belvedere. Also, it was a pub-
licity feat of the first order. GM's Fire-
bird, with a chassis and body deliberately
designed to restrict the car to airport run-
ways, may capture your fancy but not your

This simplified display diagram makes it easy to follow the flow of gases in
GM's actual bus installation.
imagination. The Plymouth, on the other
hand, you can visualize in your garage.
We don't profess to know how Chrysler
accomplished their feat, and they're cer-
tainly not telling. One method would be
to have an exchanger containing a maxi-
mum number of aberrations in a given
surface area (like a porcupine), but this
would be impossibly expensive to con-
struct. Looked at another way, our slide
rule shows that an exchanger efficient
enough to do the job could be constructed
from about 3000 feet of half-inch di-
ameter tubing. This, folded up, would be
quite a basket of worms—much too big
to cram into a Plymouth engine com-
partment.
We therefore suspect that the solu-
tion is a relatively simple and com-
pact surface which is mechanically ro-
tated. This is one way to augment the
area of heat exchange artificially.
With reasonable accuracy, it can be
compared with stirring your coffee
to cool it.
The paragraph in italics is laden with
dynamite because we are speculating on a
secret which Chrysler has literally placed
under armed guard.
Chrysler has good reason to guard its
baby because they are a world's record
broad jump and more ahead of competi-
tion in the automotive turbine field. Tests
show their whirlybird to be nearly as eco-
nomical as the current piston-driven Plym-
outh in all power ranges, a vitally im-
portant claim because an auto needs less
than 30 per cent power most of the time.
At 40 mph, for example, about 15 mpg is
a normal test result for the Plymouth tur-
bine. All other turbine engines (including
the latest aircraft) have to operate at full
throttle (sea level) before they show even
a reasonable economy-power relationship.
In a car such as the Firebird, this amounts
to only four or five mpg. At part throttle,
the Plymouth turbine has shown about 20
times better economy than competitive
turbines.
No one seems to actively dispute the
conclusion that the regenerative turbine
is the answer to automotive (or, for that
matter, aircraft) needs. The catch is that
no one except Chrysler has been able to
produce a practical one so far. In fact,
they now have two, both housed in iden-
tical stock clothing. At the recent open-
ing of the Chrysler proving ground (see
page ??), a comparative economy test was
planned with a regenerator temporarily
removed from one of the cars. This proj-
ect was quickly cancelled when the in-
sulation started smoldering on the hot
exhaust of the non-regenerative version.

widely used in aircraft, are much too complicated for automo-
tive use, as Rover found out (their first car used this type).
The best of them have about 17 stages of compression. This
requires at least 1500 blades of perhaps 13 different airfoils.
Rover is now producing fon sale a stationary turbine power-
plant, but it has little outward resemblance to the original. The
turbine itself is axial flow, but not the compressor.
As you can see, you can't see much under the hood of
Plymouth's hushed turbine.
Fiat's approach, with two stages of centrifugal compression,
is also impossibly costly to mass-produce. In the world of the
turbine, what we know as compression ratio is more accurately
called pressure ratio. A two-stage, centrifugal compressor with
a 10 to 1 pressure ratio has reached the point of diminishing
returns because you can easily reach 90 per cent of possible-
practical thermal efficiency for this type engine in the first
stage (without the boost from regeneration this is a very low
overall figure). The higher pressure ratio also requires a sec-
ond power turbine to absorb the additional energy, and this
further adds to the cost.
So far, we have talked about every company except Ford.
Young Henry's outfit does not have the wartime turbine de-
velopment experience of either Chrysler or General Motors.
Possibly, this is an advantage because at least they can start
from scratch without any preconceived notions. This they did
approximately two years ago.
At presstime, Ford does not have a complete and operable
turbine. However, they have accumulated considerable experi-
ence testing components such as burners and compressors.
Lately, this work is being conducted in one of the most mod-
ern research facilities solely devoted to automotive turbines in
the country. To quote Andy Kucher, "They will introduce their
turbine if and when they have a design that meets all the re-
quirements of an automotive powerplant and one which they
consider capable of being mass-produced." This statement,
which is by no means an apology for lack of past performance,
has a lot of ramifications.
For example, much has been said about the scarcity of
metals, such as tungsten, cobalt, and molybdenum, which must
be added to steels used in turbine components. Actually, assum-
ing defense needs remain at current levels, it is estimated that
there is at least enough of these metals around to support addi-
tional production of approximately 100,000 turbine-powered
automobiles a year. The problem is not so much scarcity, but
how to engineer and economically fabricate the tough alloys in-
volved. A major share of the Ford effort is directed towards
solving these problems. They feel that the turbine should
not be considered a novelty, and that initial high production
of a suitable design is the only way to achieve reasonable costs.
It is possible that economical ways will be found to machine
and fabricate these reluctant and scarce alloys, and with de-
mand will come new sources of supply. However, Kucher is
not neglecting alternate materials. This investigation involves
ceramels and ceramets. Both words are contractions meaning
the same thing—an admixture of silica and metal. The prefix
before the word "mixture" is simply an admission that the two
substances are rather poor bed-fellows.
Perhaps we should clarify that when cost becomes a factor
(not always true of aircraft engines), the much emphasized
material problem lies in the composition, fabrication, and in-
stallation of turbine wheel blades, commonly known as "buck-
ets." These buckets must operate and thrive in temperatures
ranging from atmospheric to 1500° F. This is quite a variation
and becomes thermally shocking when the transition is too
rapid. Ceramics (like in your spark plug insulator) have poor
resistance to such goings on. Added metal gives these ceramics
(now ceramels or ceramets) for fortitude, but they still aren't
as good as the all-metal original bucket. In addition, there is
quite a problem in bonding them to the turbine wheel itself.
Nevertheless, they could be the ultimate solution to mass-
produced turbine powered Fords.
So you have the run-down on automotive turbine progress
to date. On the one hand you have the uninhibited GM Fire-
bird with its fantastic body that in %-inch scale model form
was actually wind-tunnel tested at the California Institute of
Technology. On the other you have a prosaic-looking Plymouth

that has the equivalent (performance-wise, /';/ high gear) of a

AEC Approves Safety Provisions
of UM Reactor
Safety provisions for a one million-watt
nuclear reactor for research at the Univer-
sity of Michigan have been approved by
the Atomic Energy Commision and con-
struction is expected to begin early in
1955.
Dean Ralph A. Sawyer, Director of the
Michigan Memorial-Phoenix Project, an-
nounced receipt of a letter from Dr.
Thomas H. Johnson, Director of the Re-
search Division of the A.E.C., setting
forth operating conditions and safety pre-
cautions to be followed in the proposed
installation.
A uranium fuel supply for the reactor
was assured by theA.E.C. in June, through
a letter from A.E.C. Chairman Lewis L.
Strauss to University President Harlan
Hatcher. The faculty was also approved
at that time, subject to the negotiation of
mutually-acceptable safety and operating
requirements.
Work on the reactor and the structure
to house it will begin early in 1955, Dean
Sawyer said, and completion is expected
in the spring of 1956. The building will
be an extension of the north end of the
Phoenix Memorial Laboratory now rising
on the University's new North Campus.
The windowless, three-story addition
and reactor will be financed from a grant
of $1,000,000 made by the Ford Motor
Company Fund to the Phoenix Project,
the University's research program on the
peaceful uses of atomic energy.
Initial operation of the! reactor will be
at 100 kilowatts average power over eight
hours with a peak of 1,000 kilowatts.
This will provide the most intense source
of neutrons and gamma rays in operation
by a non-governmental agency and open
to scientific and industrial research on an
unclassified basis, Dean Sawyer said.
The reactor will also figure prominent-
ly in the University's training program
for nuclear engineers and scientists.
The operating and safety requirements
deal with power levels, fuel element ar-
rangement, operating temperatures and
other technical specifications designed to
guarantee that the reactor will run safely
under all conditions.
"We feel that the careful study made
by all concerned has resulted in a reac-
tor installation which will provide the
maximum in flexibility and research along
with complete safety and reliability,"
Dean Sawyer observed.
The reactor building will be a 40-foot
high, 70-foot square box with concrete
walls a foot thick. Within the structure
will be a 40,000-gallon tank of water, 26
feet high. Its walls will be of special high-
density concrete six-feet thick at the base.
The reactor itself will be about two
feet long on each side, and will be sus-
pended under 20 feet of water from a
bridge at the top of the tank. The fuel
supply will be made up of 20 aluminum
cans, each containing 18-aluminum-
uranium alloy strips.
Research workers and observers will be
protected from the intense radiation gen-
erated by the reactor by the water in the
tank and the heavy concrete. Even at the
maximum power level, Dean Sawyer
pointed out, this shielding will keep the
radiation level in the building to within
one-tenth that considered acceptable by
A.E.C. standards.
The open top of the reactor and 20
feet of water above it will provide a safe
and convenient window through which
operations may be observed, and through
which materials to be irradiated in the
reactor radiation field may be lowered.
When desired, beams of neutrons,
gamma rays, or both—emitted when the
nuclei of atoms in the highly-purified
uranium 235 are split—can be brought
out into the laboratory through special
"beam ports" for research purposes.
These ports can be closed to provide
complete protection from radiation; when
they are open, however, strict precautions
must be taken so that no one accidentally
walks through an invisible radiation beam.
Because of this and similar hazards,
the public will be permitted in the reactor
building only on a "conducted tour" basis,
Dean Sawyer said.
The reactor will be maintained at pre-
scribed power levels by a system of auto-
matic and auxiliary control rods in the
fuel core, which serve to absorb neutrons
and thereby regulate the chain reaction.
Dean Sawyer added that the design of
the reactor is of an inherently stable na-
ture, and that the power level can never
rise excessively.
Professor Henry J. Gomberg, assistant
director of the Phoenix Project and chair-
man of the Nuclear Engineering Commit-
tee of the College of Engineering, out-
lined the following services the reactor
will provide:
"First, it will serve as a primary radia-
tion source for research on the utilization
of radiation in engineering, physics,
chemistry, biology, medicine and in all
other sciences in which radiation and its
applications are becoming increasingly-
important. This radiation can help create
new materials, alter old ones, probe the
structure of matter, effect genetic changes
in living material and interfere with or
kill undesired organisms or growths. It
is a new type of research that has already-
shown great promise of important re-
sults."
"Second, it will be used as a major
teaching laboratory in the theory, con-
struction and operation of nuclear reac-
tors, which now promise to develop as a
major source of energy for industry. It
will permit the University to add substan-
tially to the supply of men needed in
this new technology, both here and in
friendly nations abroad."
Dean Sawyer observed that when the
reactor is completed and in operation, the
University will have "the most complete
and balanced set of intense-radiation
sources now available: the reactor and ten-
kilocurie cobalt source of the Phoenix
Project, and the synchrotron and cyclo-
tron of the Physics Department."
Smith, Hinchman and Grylls, Detroit
architectural and engineering firm, de-
signed the reactor housing, while the re-
actor was designed by the Babcock and
Wilcox Company of Akron, Ohio. The
basic reactor concept used was originated
by the A.E.C. Laboratories at Oak Ridge,
Tenn.
The reactor project was co-ordinated
by Lawrence C. Widdoes, Project Engi-
neer, working under the University's Re-
actor Planning Committee.

Training has many facets in a big firm like Du Pont, Dress,
and a great deal of thought has been given to make it truly
effective. We look upon training as a very important factor
in a man's career. We think that the best way to train a col-
lege graduate is to give him a maximum of on-the-job re-
sponsibility in a minimum length of time. That's the general
guiding policy at Du Pont, Dress.
Of course, each department varies this general policy to
suit its special needs. A new man being trained for produc-
tion supervision may first spend a year or so in laboratory
or plant development work. Or he may spend his training
period as a plant operator. Thus a man obtains firsthand
knowledge of his process, and establishes a bond of mutual
respect with the men he'll be working with on his first major
assignment.
A young man interested in sales is often first assigned to a
plant or laboratory dealing with the products he will later
sell; or he may join a group of trainees to learn selling tech-
niques right from the start.
An engineer, chemist, or other technical graduate is usual-
ly chosen for a specific job within his major field of study.
Such a man brings specialized knowledge and skill to his
job, and he is encouraged to put them to use promptly. But
at Du Pont his experiences on the job are supplemented
with lectures, conferences and discussion groups. In a very
real sense, new technical employees continue training in
their specialties after joining the Company.
To sum it all up, Dress, Du Pont's training program is
individualized to provide a new man with specific oppor-
tunities to learn from contacts with more experienced men.
The prime objective of Du Pont training is always kept
clearly in mind—to develop men for future advancement
and effectiveness in the organization.

automation would act as a prod to our en-
tire economy in three ways: first, by ex-
panding the capital goods industry—
(building the automation devices); sec-
ond, by enabling labor to increase its
earning power—(higher skills and greater
productivity); and third, by reducing
overall costs of production.
Recently, William E. Rappard, an emi-
nent Swiss economist, addressed an audi-
ence of French economists on "The Secret
of American Prosperity." He listed these
reasons for the economic superiority of
the United States:
• Mass markets
• Scientific research applied to produc-
tion
• The U. S. "passion for productivity"
and
• The spirit of competition
You all know the old saying that goes:
"Oh wad some power the giftie gie us
To see oursels as others see us!"
Mr. Rappard is holding the mirror so
that we can see that our economic well-
being in this country comes from our
ability to out-produce and out-consume
all others. What could be a better testi-
monial to the economic necessity of auto-
mation than this? Increased productivity
and a higher standard of living—the
marks of our "economic superiority"—are
automation's end products.
In addition to increasing our standard
of living, we have concerned ourselves
with lightening the burden on labor. In
the past fifty years, it has required in-
creasingly less human effort to produce
greater and greater portions of goods and
services because of our efforts to utilize
more and more machinery wherever pos-
sible.
Many have said that automation would
displace labor and cause widespread un-
employment. Certainly, the same things
must have been said about mass produc-
tion, the invention of the sewing machine,
the invention of the steam engine, even
the old lamplighter, if you will—in fact,
about all of the other significant advances
in manufacturing during the last fifty
years.
In my opinion, automation will do just
the opposite. It will create more jobs,
create more products at less cost and in-
crease the ability of people to consume.
It is the key to less human effort in the
future and an increase in our standard of
living of tomorrow.
Our industrial history dearly demon-
strates the ability of American business
continuously to improve old products and
to create new ones—all for the purpose
of expanding markets. Inventive genius
combined with the spirit of competition
has been the driving force behind the con-
tinual expansion of our productive forces.
This is why the gloom merchants with
their cries and laments concerning techno-
logical unemployment have always been
false prophets. Automation is raising cries
of alarm again in these same quarters—
and, as always, they will be found to be
without foundation. I am certain that any
technological advance such as automation
can be absorbed in our total econom;
without even a trace of a ripple on th&lt;
surface.
Automation, then, will enable us t&lt;
meet the needs of our expanding popula
tion—will increase our standard of liv
ing and will provide us with more am
better goods and services.
Where May Automation Be Employed!
Automation may be used in all type:
and sizes of industrial concerns. Yoi
might think that only the very large, mas;
producing industries, such as the automo-
bile industry, could successfully use it

philosophy to very small concerns.
The extent of automation in any con-
cern depends upon the breadth of vision,
imagination and courage of its top man-
agement. Without imagination and cour-
age, management is more content to stick
with the "tried and true" methods of
production. Even at Ford, believe it or
not, we have difficulty in selling some of
our manufacturing engineers on the ad-
vantages of automation. These engineers
are more prone to stick with the "tried
and true" methods. We have a continuous
problem of educating all levels of man-
agement as to the virtues of this new
technological advancement. And even
when management has been sold, it is
necessary to keep them sold.
It will be our problem—those of us
who have an understanding of automation
—to develop this understanding at all
levels of management. Then, and only
then, can this new manufacturing process
be used to provide the fruits of great pro-
ductivity.
1 am sure you all realize that the con-
cept of automation is more readily wel-
comed in those industries where a stable
product is produced at high volumes.
Much can be gained by increasing pro-
ducticity through this means. Here, in-
deed, is fertile ground for the "automa-
tion engineer" to practice his profession.
When May Automation Be Used?
Generally speaking, automation is
something that must be planned well in
advance of incorporation into the manu-
facturing process. As Mr. Brainard said,
"It is a philosophy that may extend back
to the design of the product." So in this
sense it begins at the very beginning.
Starting with product design, each ele-
ment of management must include in its
plans the most advantageous use of this
new method.
The construction of a new facility af-
fords the greatest opportunity to incor-
porate these specialized devices in a
manufacturing operation. For example,
our Cleveland Engine Plant gave us an
excellent opportunity to utilize them ex-
tensively. Our engineers had a wide lati-
tude in arranging the equipment and flow
of materials to afford the maximum use
of these devices. In addition, our top
management was sold on the need for in-
corporating the very latest technological
changes into that new facility. For us,
automation was at the top of the list.
In our other new facilities, we have at-
tempted to include more and more of
these devices wherever they could be engi-
neered successfully into the manufactur-
ing operation. We have done this through
a process of continual review and study
of new applications. This has borne fruit.
We have discovered many new uses that
might have been overlooked.
At the same time, there are plenty of
opportunities for everyone to use auto-
mation to one degree or another in exist-
ing facilities. Facilities need not be dras-
tically rearranged or rebuilt to incorporate
it. What is required, however, is the hon-
est desire to improve upon productivity
by applying this new concept. The de-
gree to which this can be done depends
upon the imagination of the engineers.
By the way, I believe it is appropriate
at this time to give high praise to the
various segments of industry which have
made significant contributions to the ad-
vancement of automation. I would like
to name just a few of those who have con-
tributed much:
• Machine tool manufacturers
• Electric motor manufacturers
• Electric control manufacturers
• Hydraulic control manufacturers
There are many, many more that should
be mentioned. The present success of au-
tomation is the result of the efforts of all
and not just the few.
So far, I have been talking about auto-
mation in very general terms. I believe
that it must be understood on this basis
before it can be applied to specific sit-
uations.
Development of Automation Devices
At Ford
It might be useful to you if I would
relate some of the lessons that we have
learned at Ford. These were learned the
hard way after many months of experi-
mentation and operation. (Let me say at
this point that automation is not always
easy to accomplish—but we are convinced
that it is here to stay and we; expect a
very bright future for it at Ford and in
industry.)
In the early days we found that the
work had to be done by the cut-and-try
method. This is often the case in any new
development. We found that it was neces-
sary to set up departments concentrating
on this phase of our business. We had to
train people who could compromise the
tried methods of materials handling with
the exactness of machine design. The
automation designer had to combine these

Material* and thtir pftpcro' =-
'reparation off Rubber Insulation
and Jacket Compounds
TERIALS AND THEIR PREPARATION. The materials used in the
paration of rubber insulation and jacket compounds may consist
natural or synthetic rubber along with mineral rubber and re-
imed rubber and the necessary compounding ingredients con-
ing of anti-oxidants, fillers, pigments, plasticizers and vulcanizing
mts. The rubber or rubber-like materials are given a preliminary
stication or break-down on rubber mills or internal mixers to
ilitate subsequent compounding operations. They are stored in
uitable form until required for compounding.
The required compounding ingredients, except the vulcanizing
:nts, used in insulating compounds, are carefully weighed into a
table container. The plasticized rubber or rubber-like materials
weighed last. The vulcanizing agents are weighed in a separate
itainer.
MPOUND MIXING. Rubber insulation and jacket compounds
y be mixed on rubber mills or in internal mixers.
[he rubber mill consists of two driven rolls about 28 inches in
No. 7 In a stritt
diameter and from 60 to 84 inches in length. The axes of the rolls
are held in a single horizontal plane by the mill frame above a suit-
able pan. Adjustments are provided to control the spacing between
the rolls. Each roll is equipped—for water circulation—for cooling.
The rolls rotate in opposite directions in such a manner that the
surfaces approach each other at the top. The surface speed of the
back roll is about 1.2 times that of the front roll. This differences
surface speed assists greatly in break-down of the rubber and in-
corporation of the compounding materials.
The rubber-like materials, and mineral rubber, when used, art
placed between the rolls first and masticated until so plasticized that
they form a continuous sheet on the front roll. The solid ingredients,
except the vulcanizing agents for insulating compounds, are then
placed on the mill and incorporated in the rubbers. Any solids which
drop between the rolls are retained in the mill pan and then returned
to the mill.
After the solid materials have been incorporated, the batch'«
thoroughly blended by cutting the rubber sheet about half wj

(ortion. This blending may require about fifteen minutes and the
ntire mixing cycle approximately a half hour. After blending, the
cmpound is removed from the mill in rolls suitable for feeding to
he strainer.
The internal mixing unit consists of a mixer located above a
ubber mill. The mixer consists of essentially two rotors with
piraled blades rotating in opposite directions at different speeds in
closed chamber. The direction of the spiral of the blades changes
t the middle of the rolls. An air-controlled ram forces the mate-
ials into the mixing chamber. The mixed batch is discharged from
he bottom through a hydraulically operated gate.
The effectiveness of the internal mixer as compared with the mill
or breaking down and compounding rubber is evident from a con-
ideration of its method of operation. In addition to the difference in
K rate of rotation of the rotors, the interrupted spiral of the blades
•educes a continuous and uniform movement of the compound
Compound mixing
from the middle to the ends of the rotors. The walls of the chamber
we stationary and hence the difference in rate of movement of
material adjacent to the rotors and the walls is great. These con-
ditions insure that every part of the batch being mixed will come in
contact with every other part in a relatively short time. Mixing
requires about fifteen minutes. After mixing, the compound is dis-
charged to the mill below from which it is removed in a form suit-
able for feeding to the strainer.
STRAINING. The strainer consists essentially of a mechanically
driven screw located in a cylindrical cast iron housing. The housing
is provided with an opening for feeding the screw and supports the
tad of the strainer. The head at the outlet end of the screw pro-
vides a suitable support for a thirty-six mesh screen through which
the rubber insulating compounds are forced by the screw. The
strainer operates on the same general principle as the ordinary
household food chopper.
The mixed compound is fed into the strainer and forced through
screen. Large particles of foreign or undispersed materials are
'stained on the screen. The strained rubber compound is returned
10 a mixing mill or internal mixer where the vulcanizing agents are
*dded. The complete insulating compound is then removed from the
■sill in sheets for immediate application to wire or for storage.
Jacket compounds are prepared in the same general way as
insulating compounds except that the vulcanizing agents are incor-
porated along with the other solid fillers in mill mixing or on the
sheeting mill of the internal mixing unit. Jacket compounds are
not strained.
LATEX COMPOUNDING. Compounding rubber in the form of latex
involves the handling of rubber in the form of a liquid and, there-
fore, requires lighter and less costly equipment than that just
described for the compounding of plastic rubber. In addition to the
actual preparation of the compound, it involves, for latex insulation,
the purification of the rubber in latex form.
Latex rubber is purified by diluting a known quantity of latex to
approximately 33 per cent solids and heating to a temperature of
150°F. in a steel tank provided with a stirrer. The required amount
of creaming agent, dissolved in water, is then added and the mixture
stirred. The stirring is discontinued and the warm latex allowed to
stand for about 48 hours. The rubber, being lighter than water, rises
to the top in much the same way that cream separates from milk.
The bottom layer, the serum containing the major portion of the
impurities, is discarded leaving the purified rubber in the form of a
cream in the tank. This process is repeated until rubber of the
desired purity is obtained.
For use in latex compounds, ordinary rubber compounding in-
gredients are ground more finely, thoroughly protected, and wet
with water. This is accomplished in a ball mill. A ball mill consists
of a porcelain lined steel drum, provided with a suitable opening and
supported with its axis horizontal in such a manner that it can be
rotated. The cylinder is about half-filled with flint pebbles.
Definite amounts of the various compounding ingredients, to-
gether with the required amounts of protective agents and water,
are then placed in the ball mill and suitably ground. Sulfur, being
the most difficult material to grind, wet and protect, is milled for
about three weeks. All the other ingredients require about one week.
The required amounts of these properly protected and wet in-
gredients are then carefully weighed and added, along with the
stabilizers and water, to a known amount of purified rubber, in the
form of latex. The mixture is stirred for about two hours to insure
thorough mixing. It is then transferred through a 100 mesh strainer
to a storage tank until applied to wire.

Robert P. Weeks is certainly no strang-
er to the University of Michigan. He re-
ceived his A.B., A.M., and Ph.D. degrees
here, and has worked his way up to the
position of assistant professor in the Eng-
lish department of the College of Engi-
neering. He has never taught at another
university.
Mr. Weeks, who is a very young look-
ing thirty-nine, could easily pass for a
graduate student. He usually wears sport
jackets and slacks and conducts his classes
with comparable informality. This air of
informality seems to make the process of
learning engineering English a great deal
less painful.
Mr. Weeks' classes are known to be in-
teresting, and he is very popular with
his students. When he was asked to
state his views on teaching, he said,
"I try to create a democratic, informal
atmosphere in the classroom. I believe
that English is a subject that many stu-
dents dislike because their high school
teachers taught it to them in a stiff,
authoritarian way."
In spite of the time consumed by teach-
ing and research work, Mr. Weeks has
time for several hobbies, which include
photography, automobiles, and jazz. He-
is also interested in science-fiction, and
wrote his doctoral thesis on H. G. Wells,
whose "Time Machine" is one of the
classics of science-fiction. He is also mar-
ried and has two children, a boy and a
girl-
As a teacher of the humanities in an
engineering college, Mr. Weeks is under-
standably interested in the problem of
liberalizing engineering education. He be-
lieves that the engineer at the University
of Michigan does not get enough liberal
education. Because of this interest of his
he is connected with the Humanistic-Social
Research Project, which is sponsored by
the American Society for Engineering
Education. The purpose of this project is
to visit a number of engineering colleges
and study their curriculums, especially
their courses in the humanities and social
sciences. The project is designed to help
educators make the most effective use of
Robert P. Weeks
the time allotted to subjects like history,
economics, psychology, and English.
Because few engineers seem to select
English courses in the summer, Mr.
Weeks has a first hand knowledge of
mass production industry. He has work-
ed as an aircraft riveter at Willow Run,
and also on the assembly line at the Lin-
coln-Mercury plant. He spent last sum-
mer writing articles for magazines such
as Coronet and Pageant.
Although Mr. Weeks and his wife and
children live in Pittsfield Park, a suburb
of Ann Arbor, he is often seen at pep
rallies, track meets, or at the Union or
I M building in the tow of his six-year
old son. Because Mr. Weeks has been
around the university so long, he enjoys
going to many of its functions, and this
also makes his students like him better.
From this short sketch, Mr. Weeks is
seen to be an interesting and extremely
likeable man as well as an assistant pro-
fessor with a bright future ahead of him.
It's true that many students consider Eng-
lish a dry subject, but with Mr. Weeks,
there's never a dull moment!

So great was the departure in design of the new Bell System
wire spring relay as compared with conventional relays that
it posed a major undertaking for development engineers at
Western Electric, the manufacturing and supply unit of the
Bell System. Indeed, it was an undertaking that called for
new machines and new methods because none was available
to do the job.
Longer life, higher operating speed, lower power con-
sumption, and lower manufacturing cost were some of the
advantages promised by the new relay design. Engineers
reasoned that a lower manufacturing cost could be achieved
through greater precision in manufacture (which would cut
adjustments) and through extensive use of automatic
processes.
One of the products of this reasoning is pictured at the
top of this page. This battery of equipment, developed by
Western Electric product engineers, constitutes one phase
of wire spring relay manufacture, which automatically per-
forms several separate operations. Its function begins after
one of the fundamental elements of the new relay has been
fabricated. This element, known as a "comb," consists of a
multiplicity of small diameter wires in parallel array im-
bedded for part of their length in molded phenol plastic.
These molded elements, of which there are two types used
in the new relay, are delivered to this line of machine units
in magazines. By fully automatic means they are removed
from the magazine, carried by a reciprocating conveyor
through each of the several processes and, when completed,
placed into another magazine to await further assembly.
Between the first and final magazine the automatic bat-
tery of equipment does the following operations: clips wire
ends, attaches palladium contacts to wire ends by means of
percussion welding, sizes contacts, forms terminal, tension
bends wires, fluxes and tins terminals.
Most remarkable of all is the fact that this is a precision
operation throughout. For example, the small block con-

with his imagination, engineering knowl-
edge and general design experience in
order to obtain a satisfactory system.
Today, however, automation is an im-
portant part of our equipment designing
activities. We look upon it as we do any
other phase of our manufacturing proc-
ess, such as the need for machining, press
forming, painting, washing, heat treating
or assembly. We know that it must be
considered at the same time that we de-
velop all of the other portions of the
manufacturing process. If not, it may be
impossible to make an adequate installa-
tion at a later date.
Our automation plans begin early in the
program of planning for new facilities.
The automation designer must be avail-
able at the same time the preliminary
plant layouts are being developed so that
arrangements can be made for the in-
stallation of the transfer mechanisms.
A few years ago, machinery for pro-
duction line was selected from processing
based on the use of individual marhine
tools. Each of these machine tools per-
formed a small increment of the total
work required to produce a given part.
We had to tie together these individual
machine tools as best we could with exist-
ing conveying devices. Regardless of what
we did, there still remained a considerable
amount of manual handling in connection
with their operation.
Today, our processing for machining
operations is based on the combining of
similar operations into a machine tool of
many stations with automatic transfers
between the individual stations. As you
know, this type of machine is quite com-
monly called a Transfer Machine.
The principles of automation were the
motivating force behind the development
of the transfer machine. The production
of automotive crankshafts is a good illu-
stration of this. In manufacturing this
part, we are required to drill six oil holes,
six metering holes and six lightening
holes. By the old method, we would have
required 29 individual machines. Today,
we need only three separate machines of
8 stations each. We need only to load
and unload the machine—all else is done
automatically. This resulted in a 40 per-
cent reduction in floor space. The amount
of direct labor required was reduced. At
the same time, however, there was an in-
crease in the indirect labor requirements.
You might be interested to know we
have found from our experience that the
most desirable way to procure automation
equipment is to engage a contractor who,
working with our engineers, will design,
fabricate, deliver, install and test it. Be-
cause of this, we attempt to place all re-
sponsibility on one party if it is at all
possible. We can do this today much more
readily than we could just a few years
back.
The Effect of Automation on Production
Automation has had some obvious ef-
fects on our manufacturing operation. The
most significant of these are:
a. Lower Production costs—Automation
helps lower our production costs by
relieving manual effort required in
handling parts and by reducing inher-
ent delay, especially in our large vol-
ume operations. There has been some

You're looking at a kilowatt-hour* of electricity in its
raw state—coal. This lump of coal weighs only 12
ounces. Not too long ago, the amount of coal required
to produce a single kilowatt-hour of electricity was con-
siderably larger and weighed 5 pounds. The difference
between yesterday's 5 pounds and today's 12 ounces lies
in improved steam technology, in better boilers—operat-
ing at higher pressures and temperatures—to make the
steam that spins the turbines to make electric power.
Impressive as this progress appears, it represents only
the current level of accomplishment in the quest for more
and still more efficiency. Thanks to America's power en-
gineers, continuing advances in the fields of metallurgy,
combustion and design will make it possible to squeeze
even more energy from a lump of coal.
*A kilowatt-hour will give you the power for, among other things, 10
solid hours of radio and recorded music, 14 hours of fan-cooling,

much of the monotonous and repeti-
tive work has contributed significant-
ly to the reduced cost and increased
production obtained.
Increased Machine Speed—In certain
of our machines, the speed is deter-
mined by the loading and unloading
operations. Automatic transferring op-
erations have made it possible to oper-
ate these machines nearer to their
maximum rated capacity. For example,
in the operation of our presses, this
often results in less stopping and
starting and, consequently, less wear
and tear on clutches and brakes. The
greater utilization of expensive pro-
duction machines is an obvious pro-
duction advantage.
Quality—Quality has been improved
by reducing damage caused by parts
hitting each other or falling to the
floor. In some cases, we have built our
quality control gages right into the
production lines and have tied them
into our equipment.
AUTOMATION
(Continued from page 32)
Control Problems on the Automation
System
The greater utilization of transfer-type
machines and automation has resulted in
the need for better control systems. These
control systems make it possible for all
elements of the machinery and equipment
to operate in harmony with each other.
There are two types of control systems
which I believe are extremely important in
conjunction with our processes. The first
is the electric control center, and the
second is the tool control board.
The key to the successful operation of
our transfer machines and interlocking
automation devices is an adequately engi-
neered electrical system. This controls
the movement of parts between individual
stations of the transfer machine and be-
tween transfer machines. The electrical
system must be so arranged that a part is
loaded into a machine as quickly as pos-
sible after the machine has shuttled the
preceding part to another station. By the
same token, the control mechanism must
prevent a part from moving into a work
station until it can be received.
Electric nerve centers have been de-

veloped to tie together the essential con-
trol devices for a given machine and its
supporting system.
The tool control board is a very recent
development. It is needed to keep ma-
chine down-time to a minimum. As you
well know, in the case of transfer-type
machines, when one tool fails, the entire
machine is shut down. Adequate control
is a necessity with the increased number
of tools to change. The tool control board
has helped greatly in improving tool
trouble conditions. Each transfer machine
has a tool control board with a definite
place for storing tools which are preset
and ready to be placed in operation as re-
quired. These tools are preset in their
holders so that they can be placed in
operation immediately without the need
for making extensive adjustments to the
machine tool.
Another feature of the tool control
board is the toolometer dial. The dial is
basically a simple timing device. Each
group of similar tools has a dial to control
its replacement. The toolometer dial is
set to indicate the number of pieces which
a given tool should produce. When the
dial has reached that predetermined fig-
ure, the machine is shut down and the
tools are changed. At the same time, other
tools which are approaching the end of
their usefulness are also changed to take
full advantage of the machine shutdown.
The tool control board has served to
keep our production machines going and,
also, has assisted greatly in controlling
tool life. Tools which are removed before
they are completely worn out are reground
and used over again without loss of tool
life.
Problems of Preventive Maintenance
All manufacturers should consider
utilizing a program of preventive main-
tenance. This is particularly important if
they use large quantities of automatic ma-
chinery and automation devices. These
must be properly maintained if they are
to accomplish their intended purpose.
The modern production line is geared
to produce a definite number of units per
hour. If we lose these units, they cannot
be made up; consequently, we must con-
sider our maintenance program from this
standpoint. We must keep adequate ma-
chinery and equipment records. We must
lubricate on schedule. We must constant-
ly check our facilities to make certain

MISSILE
Power Plant Development
W. 5. "Gus" Broffitt, who received his B.S. in Mechanical Engineering,
U. of Kentucky in 1938, is now Section Head of the Installation Liaison
and Engineering group of the Allison Turbo-Jet Engineering. Shown here
by a J33-A-37, he is holding an inner combustion liner that has been
through the aluminum dipping process, a step which helps cut critical
materials in this high speed, low cost jet engine, designed for 100%
reliability.
• The Allison jet powered USAF B-61 Martin Matador
is the country's first operational ground-to-ground
pilotless bomber. And, it's the first such missile to be
sent overseas for duty.
The B-61 engine—an Allison J33-A-37—is based
on the proven Allison centrifugal flow engine. This
engine has accumulated more than 2Vi million hours
of flight in such aircraft as the Lockheed F-80 Shooting
Star, the T-33 Trainer, F-94 Night Fighter, and in the
Grumman F9F Panthers and the Cougars!
In 1950, Allison undertook the project of engineer-
ing and developing a 5-hour, low-cost, expendable jet
engine for the Glenn L. Martin Co. which was under
contract with the Air Force. The missile assignment
made it necessary for Allison to design a J33 model-
incorporating reduced material, manufacturing and
testing costs—and still maintain a 100% reliability.
The concentrated efforts of Allison engineers result-
ed in an 85% reduction of critical materials in missile
engines in comparison with the similar centrifugal
flow engines built for piloted aircraft.
An aluminum dipping process, developed by Allison
engineers—in cooperation with General Motors Re-
search—helped materially in reduction of critical ma-
terials. This process was used on inner combustion
liners and permits using a low alloy steel in place of
highly critical material. The aluminum dipping process
affords corrosion protection, and still enables the liners
to withstand high combustion temperatures. First to
use aluminum dipping equipment on large parts, Alli-
son now uses the process on turbine engines scheduled
for piloted aircraft.
The missile power plant project is another example
of the variety of problems handled by Allison engi-
neering. Because Allison is continually doing pioneer
work in advanced engineering developments, we need
more technically trained men, especially young grad-
uate engineers. Want to know more about your engi-
neering future at Allison? Write now for information:

The exceptional load capacity of

of proper selection of steels, pre-

modern anti-friction principles.

that they are being maintained properly.
The purpose of a preventive mainten-
ance program is to determine the antici-
pated life of expendable parts of our
mechanical equipment and to see that
these parts are replaced before a complete
breakdown occurs. Lack of a preventive-
maintenance program can soon cause an
adequately engineered production line to
disintegrate into a low-producing, high-
cost system.
Production processes are becoming so
complicated that I believe a preventive
maintenance program is a "must." Ex-
tended use of the principles of automa-
tion will make this even more mandatory
in a well-managed plant.
More Brain Power in Our Factories
I pointed out that our production proc-
esses have become much more complicated
in the departments which use automation.
The labor required in these departments
must be selected on the masis of ability
to recognize troubles before they occur.
We must use the latest methods to keep
our machines operating and our tools in
first-class condition. It is apparent, there-
fore, that our production people must be
more highly trained than in the past. This
requires a program designed to assist
workers in preparing for this new type of
work. Workers benefit by obtaining jobs
which are less monotonous and boring
and, consequently, much more interesting.
Behind our production lines, we have
found a need for more people in the
manufacturing engineering field. In de-
veloping these new systems, we require
a higher degree of skill. Specialization is
much more necessary today than in the
past. Various engineering groups must
understand each other's problems in order
that the end product of our efforts will
be an integrated process.
A greater utilization of automation calls
for more brain power in our factories.
The management of a plant with exten-
sive automation is more complicated. For
example. We have found it necesary to
have a considerable number of individual
engineering groups, each specializing on
a certain phase of our production proc-
eses. The plant manager must coordinate
these individual engineering groups with
all the other departments necessary to
control production. He must promote
teamwork in the entire organization to
keep all phases of production planning
in constant mesh. At the same time, our
plant managers must keep themselves flex-
ible to make the best use of the various
technical skills available.
Economic Problems
The economic factors of an automation
program are very important. Automation
expenditures must pay for themselves in
the same manner as other improvements
in the manufacturing process. In the auto-
mobile industry we find that, because of
our yearly models, certain parts change
from year to year and, consequently, our
automation equipment must pay for itself
within this same period. However, there
are many instances, such as in our press
lines for body parts and machining lines
for engine and chassis parts where the
parts retain their same basic shape for an
extensive period. Consequently, the basic
automation equipment in these cases can
be amortized over a longer period.
The Future of Automation
At Ford, we are continuing to make the
most of our engineering knowledge to ex-
tend the use of transfer-type machines and
automation. The basic principles of auto-
mation have been known for a long time.
It has been only in the past decade that a
large cross-section of our manufacturing
industry has concentrated on the develop-
ment of these principles.
We have found in our discussion with
people in the automotive industry, and
with those in other manufacturing indus-
tries, that automation is being given wide
consideration. Many changes that are
taking place in our products are giving

FROM COW-PATHS TO CLOVE RLE AFS...
The narrow, twisting, rut-ridden roads of yesteryear
are being replaced by new multi-lane, high-speed
highways. Crossroads have been bridged and clover-
leafed ... hills have been leveled... curves lengthened.
These changes have happened in the half century
since the advent of the automobile. For more and
better cars and trucks demand faster, safer roads
and turnpikes.
SPACE FOR SPEED...
The traffic that flows over America's three-million
mile network of roads represents the very life stream
of our progress. Nowhere else in the world do people
travel so far and so freely . . . nor do so many trucks
deliver such a wide and plentiful supply of merchan-
dise so fast and to so many places.
AMERICA WORKS LIKE THAT...
Here in America we have men who dare to dream and
build for future needs . . . machines to move moun-
tains ... materials to make roads... and an all-seeing,
all-hearing, and reporting Inter-Communications
System that acquaints every branch of science and
engineering . . . every technical skill . . . with the
needs and the accomplishments of every other field
of endeavor.
THE AMERICAN INTER-COM SYSTEM...
Complete communication is the function, the unique
contribution of the American business press ... a
great group of specially edited magazines devoted to
the specialized work areas of men who want to
manage better, research better, sell better, buy better.
COMMUNICATION IS OUR BUSINESS...
Many of the textbooks in which you are now study-
ing the fundamentals of your specialty bear the
McGraw-Hill imprint. For McGraw-Hill is the
world's largest publisher of scientific and technical

BEFORE any product design is

"Can it be built for less money?" Un-
less your designs pass this test they
are likely to be rejected.
Knowing how to use welded steel
gives you the advantage in develop-
ing any product for lowest cost man-
ufacture. That's because steel is three
times stronger than gray iron, two
and one half times as rigid, and costs
only a third as much per pound.
Therefore, where stiffness or rigidity
is a factor in a design, less than half
the material is necessary.

sourceful engineer put these qualities

Transistors, Magamps Present Wide
New Horizons
Transistors are available only in watt
sizes and admittedly are in the baby stage
of development. Yet Westinghouse re-
search engineers are doing things with
them now, mostly in conjunction with
magnetic amplifiers, that are hard for
electronic or power engineers to believe.
Many of these come from a fairly recent-
ly acquired concept. The concept that
while the transistor alone is remarkable
and is (with the magnetic amplifier) the
key to it all, the things achieved by the
new circuitry it makes possible are fan-
tastic, particularly as larger capacity crys-
tals become available.
Transistors, in proper circuits, are be-
ing used as switches or relays. They make
possible switches, completely static and
with indefinite life, having an efficiency
better than 90 percent compared to the
50 percent of a class-A amplifier stage.
A combination of transistors and
Magamps can be used to create a time de-
lay of any given length. And always the
accuracy is to one cycle of the basic fre-
quency used. For example, a delay, even
of days or weeks, could be provided ic-
curate to 1/60 of a second, if 60-cyde
power is used. This same circuit can be
used as a counter of events, as represented
by pulses.
The old dream of a high-efficiency d-c
transformer becomes a reality. Transistors,
in a relatively simple circuit, can convert
direct current to a square wave. This, be-
ing alternating, can be changed in voltage
and, by full-wave rectification, returned to
direct current. Overall efficiencies for cir-
cuits delivering a few watts are about 90
percent.

the engineer an opportunity to apply the
latest thinking. The general trend of
product design is to provide the public
with a much wider selection of products
containing many advance- features which
were not contained in their earlier de-
signs. It is the responsibility of manufac-
turing to find ways and means of produc-
ing these added features at an economical
cost so that a wide distribution may be
obtained. I feel that automation is an
important tool which must be used in ful-
filling this responsibility.
The use of automation has progressed to
a point where most modern plants contain
some form of automation devices. A few
years ago, this was not true. We are fast
approaching a time when only this type
of plant will be considered as modern
in its manufacturing processes. I am re-
ferring here, of course, to plants which
are adaptable to automation because of
product design, volume requirements, fa-
cilities requirements and all of the related
economic factors.
I have pointed out how our under-
standing of automation has expanded
from a simple definition involving auto-
matic handling between operations to a
concept which embraces our planning for
all manufacturing processes. This change
has taken place in a relatively few years.
We will have increasing opportunities in
the future to apply automation in many
more of our manufacturing operations.
I have told you why automation is
important to our economy and where it
can be used. In fact I have tried to sell
you on its virtues. Now I must tell you
that the Government has not seen fit to
give business the proper incentives to use
more automation. Our present deprecia-
tion policy is negative by nature. What
we need is positive thinking that will
give business the necessary desire to use
the latest production equipment.
Businessmen—big, little and in-be-
tween—need incentive to re-tool their
plants. These come from the promise of
lower production costs, pressure from
competitors or favorable tax treatment, to
name just a few. I believe that a more
modern depreciation policy might provide
an even better justification for business to
launch a more rapid equipment replace-
ment program.
I believe that the advantages of auto-
mation's greater productivity might be de-
nied—certainly delayed—to business un-
less it becomes possible to recover quick-
ly the cash investments required to in-
corporate this new manufacturing method.
This is true for business of all sizes, but
particularly so with small business where
cash or cash availability is more limited.
A more enlightened depreciation policy
would eliminate this barrier to early re-
placement of machines and equipment
and encourage business to use the most
modern methods of production—obvious-
ly automation.
The newly revised income tax laws
recognized that the depreciation policy
needed to be changed. However, the
policy was changed very little—it certain-
ly failed to provide any significant tax in-
centive to business, big or small, to use
these new manufacturing methods. Try-
as it will, I am sure that this short-sighted
depreciation policy will not stop progress
but merely slow it down.
I hope that some day our government
will see the light and make the income tax
law an economic force. It can be such a
force as you all know.
The tax incentive is strong and can en-
courage industry to expand or to stand
still—whichever is desired. The govern-
ment will not lose any tax revenues as the
result of a more liberal depreciation pol-
icy—in fact, its revenues should increase.
We are the most productive country in the
world and everyone shares ultimately in
the fruits of that productivity.
Summary
I would like to close my talk with these
four thoughts about automation:
First. Automation is much more than
a way of transferring materials
from machine to machine—it
is a new concept or philosophy
of manufacturing.
Second. It is an essential step forward
in the improvement of our
production processes, leading
toward a higher standard of
living for our people.
Third. It has a wide application in
both large and small business
depending, of course, upon the
ability of management to
understand and apply its prin-
ciples.
Fourth. The era of automation is upon
us—now is the time when we
must move forward or be left
behind.

M Sandia Corporation, a subsidiary of the Western Electric Company, offers
outstanding opportunities to graduates with Bachelor's or advanced degrees, with
or without applicable experience.
mA Sandia Corporation engineers and scientists work as a team at the basic task of
applying to military uses certain of the fundamental processes developed by
nuclear physicists. This task requires original research as well as straightforward
development and production engineering.
ji A new engineer's place on the Sandia team is determined initially by his
training, experience, and talents . . . and, in a field where ingenuity and
resourcefulness are paramount, he is afforded every opportunity for professional
growth and improvement.
j4 Sandia engineers design and develop complex components and systems
that must function properly under environmental conditions that are much
more severe than those specified for industrial purposes. They design and
develop electronic equipment to collect and analyze test data; they build
instruments to measure weapons effects. As part of their work, they are
engaged in liaison with the best production and design agencies in the
country, and consult with many of the best minds in all fields of science.
jA Sandia Laboratory, operated by Sandia Corporation under contract
with the Atomic Energy Commission, is located in Albuquerque — in
the heart of the healthful Southwest. A modern, mile-high city of 150,000,
Albuquerque offers a unique combination of metropolitan facilities plus
scenic, historic and recreational attractions — and a climate that is
sunny, mild, and dry the year around. New residents have little diffi-
culty in obtaining adequate housing.
M Liberal employee benefits include paid vacations, sickness bene-
fits, group life insurance, and a contributory retirement plan.
Working conditions are excellent, and salaries are commensurate
with qualifications.
A limited number of positions for Aeronautical Engineers,
Mathematicians, and Physicists are also available.

sultant for the past 23 years at the Doug-
las Aircraft Company.
Dr. Klein, mingled optimism for the
future with a salty criticism of his own
profession, made a number of forthright
predictions of things to come in the de-
sign and use of aircraft.
Within the next half-century, he said:
1) The whole world will be reachable
(as any place in this country is now)
within a day. This implies an average fly-
ing speed of 1000 miles per hour which
will be attained long before 50 years
elapse.
2) If extra-terrestrial flight is to be
achieved, something is required to replace
chemical fuels; there are no other serious
difficulties except the financial one.
3) The helicopter will come into its
own. With helicopters, the problem of
safety is even more acute than with auto-
mobiles, as mere contact with another
helicopter can be fatal. But the conven-
ience of the helicopter is so outstanding
that its full utilization waits only on im-
provements in its reliability and safety
with a consequent reduction in cost.
4) Within 50 years most aircraft acces-
sories should work as reliably as tele-
phones do today. Our present instrument
flying system must be replaced by some-
thing less burdensome. The pilot must be
given a 3-D type of presentation so that
he will have a natural view of the situa-
tion. "Anything less does violence to his
instincts."
5) We can expect a great deal of
progress in metallurgy "since the metal-
lurgists are just beginning to come out of
the kitchen and to do their thinking at
desks." Structural alloys should be at
least twice as strong as those we are now
using. As a consequence of improved ma-
terials and improved manufacturing and
assembly techniques, our aircraft 50 years
from now will be as superior to our pres-
est best performers as today's aircraft are
to those of the first World War.
Dr. Klein, long involved in both the
teaching and applicatioa of aeronautical
theory .addressed himself forcefully to the
question of education for engineers.
"The engineer of the future," he de-
clared, "will be much better educated
than his present-day counterpart. He will
have a solid foundation in the basic sci-
ences, and will in addition be given a

know that the number of geniuses avail-
able in the industry is effectually zero . . .
He will know that neither mechanics nor

that all devices fail. ... He will be im-
mune to such false objectives as 'do it

psychological studies when he, himself,
is prejudiced and in important cases will
accept good suggestions even if they come
from disagreeable individuals. . . . He
will be trained to recognize the cycles in
human optimism and pessimism so that he
can evaluate his performance properly. . ."
"Education to prepare the designing
engineer for his job will consist of an
academic training roughly equivalent to
that for a present-day Ph.D., plus an, in-
ternship under careful supervision."
Electrical Marvels Coming Soon
Cordless electric clocks automatically
regulated by short wave from Arlington,
Va., picture-on-the-wall television, New
York to Paris flights in three hours, an
oven roast in a few minutes, luminous
ceilings. . . .
These and many other marvels of the
electrical industry will come sooner than
we realize, Chester H. Lang, General
Electric vice president of public rela-
tions, said recently.
Despite the marvels already wrought,
the electrical age is actually only begin-
ning, Lang said, and future developments
based on electricity will over-shadow all
the accomplishments thus far.
He predicted that within five years
many homes will be heated entirely by
electricity at a cost comparable to present
fuels. Flexible lighting is not far off,
with every room having luminous ceilings
which can be varied in brightness and
color for any seeing needs. Switches will
turn on the lights automatically, as one
enters the room. New types of insula-
tion will allow room for 18 cubic feet of
food storage space, both frozen and con-
ventional, in the area now required for
an 8 cubic-foot refrigerator.
Progress such as this will be equaled or
exceeded by similar advances in factories
and on farms.
The G-E official pointed out, however,
that, as in the flowering of the electrical
age, its continued growth will demand

the best in human imagination, ingenuity,
fortitude and plain, hard work.
Atomic energy holds the promise of
alleviating the misery of millions of peo-
ple, if enough men will stay up enough
nights and work hard enough, Lang said.
Calling squalor, misery and starvation the
"spawn of the appeal of international
communism," he said that if atomic en-
ergy can be put to the creative uses for
which it holds great promise, the material
well-being of the people of the world
will be improved tremendously.
A dime-sized gyroscope motor, prob-
ably the world's smallest, has been de-
signed by engineers at Westinghouse Elec-
tric Corporation for application where
space is really at a premium—on the mov-
ing antenna of aircraft fire-control radar.
The "inside-out" synchronous motor has
a tiny wound stator; the rotor is also the
inertia wheel of the gyroscope. This in-
side-out design, common to gyroscope mo-
tors, permits an element with a large
polar moment of inertia to be built into
a small space. The 2-phase, 400-cycle mo-
tor operates on less than a volt per phase,
and revolves at 8000 rpm. The gyroscope
measures the angular movement of the
antenna, enabling computers to calculate
firing information.
SWALLOWING THE WHALE
An importer reports that the sale of
whale tenderloin increased from 8,000
pounds in 1953 to 20,000 pounds in
the first ten months of 1954.
Prospecting by Air
Airborne surveys are extremely effective
in detecting the presence of uranium ore.
In one ore-bearing district in South Da-

Instead of checking the light output of the 2000-watt light bulb, General Electric
illuminating engineer Richard Blount makes a laboratory measurement of its noise
level. To help TV and movie producers improve sound quality, G. E. has developed
a line of noise-free high-wattage incandescent lamps for studio use.

The transportation of man and goods by use of the buoyancy available in water far antedates the in-
vention of the wheel, thus establishing ship design as one of the earliest engineering professions. A mod-
ern vessel today is a complex structure involving the skills of many professions and trades. The first use
of nuclear energy as propulsion power in water transportation is now a reality in the completion of the U. S.
Submarine "Nautilus." Rising costs and trade competition demand continuous refinements in hull and ma-
chinery design. The naval tank model testing equipment provides the correlation of theory and practice
prior to acceptance in the prototype construction. Problems of resistance, yaw, wave profiles, wake,
stability, seakindlines, vibration, maneuvering and other hull characteristics are studied through the use of
inexpensive models. Students here have the opportunity to observe and obtain operating data otherwise
available only through long years of experience in the field.

Whither the Engineering Council?
I suppose that people with a little more perspective than
the average student (faculty men, old grads, etc.) are in-
clined to smile wearily at any mention by students of their
"right" to student government and at the tremendous
ruckus raised on campus when any student government
group goes defunct, or when any still-alive group, flexing
its muscles, "demands a voice" in the running of Univer-
sity affairs. These people with the perspective of past years
on the campus scene have seen countless Student Councils,
Legislatures, Steering Committees, etc. become organized,
pass motions, promote projects, and then over a period of
a few years (or semesters) fall apart at the seams through
lack of a well-defined role (if any) in College administra-
tion.
A good many of these failures have followed a rather
similar pattern: A few imaginative people, sensing that as
students they are the prime purpose for and raison d'etre
of the University, decide, quite logically, that students
should have a little voice in the matter of their education.
The faculty and the administration, with equal logic, agree
and so the imaginative people form a student legislature,
council, or what have you and begin telling everyone what
the students want.
For a while the impetus of its beginning carries the group
along but, sooner or later, it must begin to hew a definite
niche for itself in the administrative scheme of things. This
is the crucial period. If the organization succeeds in finding
its place, its success is assured; if it fails, no matter how
much it struggles, its death is pre-ordained. Some groups
have succeeded, the Joint Judiciary, IFC, and IHC are note-
worthy examples; others have failed, most recently SL.
The results of the failure of student governments, stu-
dent apathy, lack of support from the faculty, the "cold
shoulder" from the administration, are often attacked as
causes for failure. They seldom are; rather, the fault seems
to lie in the student governments themselves and, particu-
larly, in what they try to do. Success is in knowing how
much to undertake. Some groups have restricted their ac-
tivities so much they died from nothing to do. Others kept
attempting projects and considering issues that were far
beyond their capacity, and died from not being able to
accomplish anything. If any moral can be drawn, it is that a
clear understanding of the power and limitations of the
group must be understood and adhered to in determining
long range policy.
What makes all this discussion pertinent is that the Engi-
neering Council, the less-than-year-old student group at-
tempting to represent engineering students, is entering this
critical period. Most of the people who organized the group
are no longer sitting on the Council. The impetus given by
the task of just organizing the Council has carried the
group through this past semester with interest running high.
But the issue is still to be met; the success of this latest of
Engineering Councils is far from certain.
Outlining a pat series of principles which, if adhered to
by the Engineering Council, would lead to ultimate success,
is rather absurd. The fate of the Council lies not in
following precepts, but in exercising judgment. Let me
illustrate: At the close of last semester the Engineering
Council was offered the job of printing and selling a series
of sample test questions to be used in the refresher course
planned for seniors taking Professional Registration Exams.
Considerable work was involved; some 85 sheets of test
questions had to be typed and lithoprinted and then sold to
students enrolled in the refresher course. This project de-
manded plenty of leg-work and plenty of money; since
little profit could be expected, it was actually a service
project. The Engineering Council did not accept this project
(Tau Beta Pi finally agreed to do it; it had been offered to
them in the first place) and every Council member con-
cerned breathed a sigh of relief. Why?
Every member of the Council (except the five members-
at-large) is sitting on the Council because he is President
of some engineering society. These people do not have
time to chase around on busy-work of the sort this project
entailed. In a sense, their potential is too valuable; such
a unified group should be planning and coordinating activi-
ties and not personally executing them. The job of taking
on service projects for the good of the school belongs to
the honorary societies; the Engineering Council should be
concerned with bigger things.
What are some projects the Engineering Council should
undertake? A few specific examples from this semesters
agenda should answer this question: The Engineering Open
House, April 23, is an exceptional opportunity to exercise
the coordinating talents of the Council; the Slide Rule Ball.
March 19, the dance by and for engineers, is another chance
to coordinate activities of all engineering groups; Student
Evaluation of the Faculty, a chance to assist the faculty
(if they are willing to be assisted) in developing better
teaching methods; and so forth. All of these projects de-
mand something more than leg-work; they demand the
support and assistance of all engineers and all engineering
groups. They are, in short, projects that only the Council
can handle.
* * *
While it is encouraging to note the enthusiastic support
thus far received from member organizations, administra-
tion, and faculty, the success of the Engineering Council
is by no means assured. Continuation of this support is
contingent upon the work the Council undertakes and
accomplishes.
It will be interesting to see how things turn out.

SHIP MODEL TESTING
The origin of ship model testing can be
triced as far back as the 18th century
when such well-known scientists as New-
ton, Euler, and Bernoulli carried out ex-
periments on the resistance of various
geometric shapes being towed through a
body of water. However, it wasn't until
William Froude developed the principles
of modern day ship model testing in the
latter part of the 19th century that the im-
portance and reliability of this work was
recognized. Some of the technical meth-
ods employed in obtaining ship model
data have been disputed, but the results
gained from its use in the design of ships
have proven beyond a doubt that it can be
used successfully.
There are eight model testing tanks in
operation in the United States at the pres-
ent time. The David Taylor Model Basin
at Cardarock, Maryland, is the largest in
this country and probably is the best equip-
ped tank in the world. The United States
Experimental Model Basin in Washing-
ton, D.C and the tank here at the Uni-
versity of Michigan are both similar in
type to the Taylor Model Basin. Tanks
are also located at Stevens Institute, New-
port News Shipbuilding Company, Webb
Institute, Massachusetts Institute of Tech-
nology, and Northwestern University.
The last tanks mentioned are smaller in
size than the first three and are equipped
differently for testing.
The tests run on ship models in these
tanks are designed to give such informa-
tion as total resistance, the correct shape
and placement of appendages, the most
efficient propeller to be used, the maneu-
verability of the ship, and its seaworthi-
ness. These tests are set up and run by
experienced tank technicians, and all ob-
tainable data is recorded. This data is
then analyzed, and predictions are made
of the performance of the full sized ship.
In order to determine the size of tank
needed for testing purposes, the size of
models to be used must first be decided
by ROGER KLINE, '56Nav.Arch.
upon. It has been concluded from experi-
ence that for ordinary work the tank cross
section should not be less than about 100
times the maximum submerged cross sec-
tion of the model. The length of the tank
depends in part upon the speed at which
the models are to be run. In addition to
the length needed for the actual testing, a
sufficient length is needed for the accel-
eration and deceleration of the model. A
general idea of size can be obtained from
a few tanks now in operation. The Uni-
versity of Michigan tank has a width of 2
feet, a depth of 10 feet, and a length of
360. The Swedish State Experiment Tank
has a cross-sectional area of approxi-
mately 544 square feet and a length of
850 feet. The models used in tanks of
this size range from about 13 to 20 feet.
Towing tanks of this size commonly use
a bridge type of towing carriage which
travels the length of the tank on some
type of rail system and carries the neces-
sary equipment for measuring such things
as resistance, trim, rolling, and vibration.
Fresh water is used to prevent excessive
corrosion. Many of these larger tanks are
specially equipped for the study of pro-
peller design, the influence of encounter-
ed waves, steering, and stability.
The majority of the tanks in this coun-
try have been built to handle models of
a much smaller size, usually around 4
feet. It has been found that a cross-sec-
tional area of from 20 to 25 square feet
is sufficient for these tanks. The method
of model propulsion is generally a tow
rope operated by a system of falling
weights.
The models used for testing purposes
are for the most part made of a paraffin-
wax base with 2 to 3 percent bees-wax
added. In some countries such as the
United States, Spain, and Italy, where
the average temperature is fairly high,
wooden models are used. The wooden
models have the advantage of being more
durable, but the paraffin models are more
easily reworked and modified, and a
smooth finish is more easily attained.
The types of tests run by a particular
tank depend on the type of equipment
available and can consist of resistance,
flow, propulsion, steering, and seaworthi-
ness tests. The most reliable information
from such tests is that used to calculate
the total resistance of the ship. This is
largely due to the fact that such an abun-
dance of testing has been done in this
field that the methods used in obtaining
and applying this data have been well
standardized and perfected.
The methods used in resistance testing
are due almost entirely to the work of
William Froude. He discovered that if a
ship and a model of the same underwater
form were run at speeds proportional to
the square root of their linear dimensions,
then their residuary resistance per ton of
displacement would be equal. Froude also
discovered that for practical purposes the
total resistance of the ship or model could
be considered to be made up of skin fric-
tion resistance and the above mentioned
residuary resistance. By deriving an em-
pirical equation, from experiments, for
calculating the skin friction resistance,
Froude was able to determine the total
resistance of a ship by adding the skin
friction resistance, thus calculated, to the
residuary resistance determined in the
model test. With certain refinements, this
general method is still in use. A method
of calculating the skin friction resistance
devised by Gebers has recently been put
into use by some tanks, but many still use
the method devised by Froude.
Flow tests are usually conducted follow-
ing resistance experiments to determine
the correct positioning of appendages such
as bilge keels and bossings. The general
procedure is to paint the hull with white
lead paint while the hull is in motion to
eject sulfide from small holes in the hull.
This results in black streaks along the
hull that show the streamline pattern of

the water flow and thus indicate the posi-
tion and shape of the appendages to be
attached. Considerable criticism has been
made of this type of test, especially when
small models are used. Because of the ap-
parent differences in the flow around the
stern of the model and full sized ship.
It is in this area that the most important
appendages are attached. This discrepancy
is practically eliminated, however, by the
use of models that are from 20 to 25 feet
in length.
One of the greatest aids to the naval
architect are the propulsion tests used to
determine the correct type of propeller
to be used on a certain ship. These tests
are usually run in two parts. The model
propeller is first run in open water (that
is, with no hull in front of it) and data
is taken at different settings of pitch, area,
and revolutions per minute. The propeller
is then run behind the model of the ship
in question, in the corect position but not
connected to the hull. This is done to
obtain correction factors for the effect of
wake, thrust deduction (due to the hull),
and hull efficiency in order that these fac-
tors may be assigned when using the
open-water data. Here too, large models
must be used to insure accurate results.
A more recent development in the field
of model testing are the steering tests
performed using large self-propelled
models. These models usually contain one
or two man crews or radio control equip-
ment. This type of test requires a larger
body of water than is afforded by the
towing tank, and only a few places in this
country are equipped to handle them. The
purpose of these tests is to determine the
maneuvering characteristics of warships
and ships, such as ferries, that have to do
much maneuvering in port.
In order to determine the characteristic
movement of a ship in rough seas, sea-
worthiness tests are performed on the
model in tanks equipped with wave-mak-
ing devices. The tow rope method is gen-
erally used because of the extreme diffi-
culty of attaching the model to the towing
carriage in such a way that the model
will not be restricted in its movement
when waves are encountered. Photo-
graphic and movie records are made of the
runs and are later analyzed for pitch and
heaving of the ship. This analysis is made
in regard to the wavelength as compared
to the length of the ship.
A great deal of the data obtained from
these various tests on a series of ships
and propellers with similar but varying
forms has been compiled in the form of
charts and graphs. This data is of great
use and very often completely does away
with the necessity for additional tank
tests. In using this data as a guide to
design, the shipbuilder should first
thoroughly acquaint himself with its limi-
tations. Caution must be taken that the
interpolations performed are not so great
as to make the results inapplicable.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Transition, in the study of fluid flows,
is the changing from a laminar to a turbo-
lent flow, of the fluid in direct contact
with a solid body immersed in any fluid.
This region of fluid flow is known as the
boundary layer. A thorough understand-
ing, of the part the boundary layer per-
forms, in the design of airfoil sections
for aircraft, is vital to the Aeronautical
Engineer.
In the design of modern aircraft air-
foil sections, the problem of transition is
of importance to obtain maximum airfoil
efficiency in all ranges of flight speeds. To
understand the phenomenon of transition
it is first necessary to consider an airfoil
having a laminar boundary layer and one
having a turbulent boundary layer.
Air having viscosity undergoes cer-
tain changes while flowing past a stream-
lined body such as an airplane wing. The
ideal condition of air flowing past a wing
is one in which the drag upon the wing is
kept to a minimum. To do this a laminar
boundary layer would have to be main-
tained over the entire wing. A laminar
boundary layer is one in which the air
flow next to the surface flows smoothly
without ripples. Since air has viscosity
this condition is impossible to maintain
over an entire wing. Over a wing, the
boundary layer varies from zero thick-
ness at the leading edge to a definite
thickness at some point on the wing.
This thickness of the boundary layer
is mainly a function of the distance
from the leading edge of the wing, the
Reynolds' number of the air flow, and the
pressure gradient over the airfoil section.
These and other factors influence the
boundary layer and determine whether it
will be laminar or turbulent.
A turbulent boundary layer is one in
which the air flow next to the surface of
the wing is not smooth and ordered like
a laminar flow, but one which is irregular
and not smooth. This turbulence and irreg-
ularity of the air flow within the boundaiy
layer is an undesirable condition since it
increases total drag of the airfoil.
Once a laminar and turbulent boundary
layer has been defined, it is possible to
describe transition. The changing of the
boundary layer from laminar to turbulent
is known as transition. Because a laminar
boundary is impossible to maintain over a
wing, it is necessary by judicious design-
ing to limit the transition point of the

boundary layer as far back from the lead-
ing edge of the wing as possible. Simple
as transition is, it is very difficult to con-
trol since it is influenced by many factors,
and maximum airfoil efficiency is depen-
dent upon transition control.
Transition is affected by many factors,
all of which are not independent of each
other. In practical cases some factors will
not permit their incorporation in design
because of adverse effects upon the air-
foil. In such cases as this only experi-
mentation can provide the solution.
The Reynolds' number of any flow is a
function of density, velocity, and viscos-
ity of the fluid and the length of the body
past which the fluid is flowing. Changes
in altitudes and velocity affect the Rey-
nolds' number for any one specific wing.
As the Reynolds' number increases the
position of the transition point along a
wing moves forward. The higher the
Reynolds' number, the closer to the lead-
ing edge of the wing is the transition
point of the boundary layer.
The influence of downstream pressure
gradient upon transition is most im-
portant. Maintaining a favorable pressure
gradient over as much of the airfoil as
possible tends to retard transition. A fav-
orable pressure gradient is one in which
the pressure with respect to distance from
the leading edge is negative. An adverse
pressure gradient tends to hasten transi-
tion. For a favorable pressure gradient
there is no point of inflection in the ve-
locity profile at the surface. An adverse
pressure gradient has a point of inflec-
tion at the surface. With an adverse
pressure gradient the instability hastens
transition, and if allowed to develop far
enough, will cause the flow to separate
with a resulting loss of lift over the wing.
The most effective method of transition
control is by suction. Unfortunately this
method is the most difficult to obtain on
aircraft. To obtain suction over an en-
tire wing it would be necesary to con-
struct hundreds of suction slots in the
wing. From the standpoint of construc-
tion this is nearly an impossibility. The
equipment necessary to provide this suc-
tion would increase the weight of the air-
plane to the point where it is doubtful
that flight would be possible.
Suction over an airfoil decreases the
thickness of the boundary layer and at the
same time keeps the airflow within the
boundary layer laminar. Drag upon an
airfoil can be reduced nearly 1.5 times.
This reduction is possible because the
boundary layer is thin and there is no
transition of the boundary layer. The use
of slots near the leading edge of the wing
is the only practical application of suction
to control transition. The effect produced
by slots is not contained over the entire
airfoil, but only over the forward por-
tion. Even this single application is quite
effective in transition control.
The effect of free stream turbulence on
transition has been quite thoroughly in-
vestigated for flow over a smooth flat
plate. Even though an airfoil is not a flat
plate, but a streamlined body, much that
has been learned in investigating the flow
over a smooth flat plate is applicable to
airfoils.
The plot obtained by Schubauer and
Skramstad in their investigations shows
that as free stream turbulence is increased
the region of laminar flow in the bound-
ary layer is decreased when expressed as
a function of Reynolds' number. Though
this plot is not entirely accurate for a
curved surface such as an airfoil, experi-
mentation has shown that the behavior
of the boundary layer in free stream turbu-
lence is quite similar to that of a smooth
flat plate. That is, the greater the amount
of turbulence in the free stream, the
greater the problem of transition of the
boundary layer.
The effect of surface roughness on
the boundary layer is much the same
as that of free stream turbulence. Conse-
quently at high flight speeds roughness
becomes an important factor in control
of transition. A smooth surface is ex-
tremely difficult to obtain on aircraft sur-
faces. The use of flush rivets and bonding
processes helps to keep surface protru-
sions to minimum, but small disturbances
caused by any rivets or fasteners disrupt
the laminar flow in the boundary layer
enough to cause a great portion of it to
become turbulent.
Transition due to surface curvature is
produced quite differently than it is by
other factors. Momentum and centrifugal
forces are responsible for the action of
the boundary layer when studied from
curvature effects. A convex surface such
as that on the upper portion of an air-
foil tends to stabilize the flow in the

On the ground floor of the new Phoe-
nix Memorial Laboratory, presently under
construction on the University's North
Campus, are located two bulky steel and
concrete cubes with massive steel doors,
and several holes of various shapes and
sizes in their walls. These are the high
level radiation "caves", one of the most
important features of the new labora-
tory. When they are completed, these
"caves" will make possible many experi-
ments with strongly radioactive materials
which are either impossible or exceeding-
ly difficult to perform with the more
primitive facilities available in many ra-
diation laboratories today. Experiments in
the chemistry and mechanics of materials
containing 8,000 or 10,000 curies of ra-
dioactivity will be performed with rela-
tive ease and accuracy by men using
mechanical arms, hands and fingers to
manipulate the deadly matter while stand-
ing safely behind three feet of heavy
shielding.
Each of the finished caves will enclose
a floor area of about ten feet by five and
one half feet with three foot walls of
barytes concrete and steel. The ceiling
will be four feet thick. Each cave will be
equipped with manipulators, for remote
handling of materials and equipment,
three windows of lead glass, a door open-
ing covered by two 14 inch thick steel
slabs, and transfer holes and ducts to
facilitate the introduction and removal of
radioactive materials.
Steel Shell. The first step in the con-
struction of the caves was the installation
of a shell of % in. steel sheets forming
the inside and outside surfaces of the
walls, as well as the surfaces of the open-
ings that were to be left for windows,
the door, manipulators and material trans-
fer ducts. This steel shell was made by
Whitehead and Kales in Detroit, from
where it was shipped in sections to Ann
Arbor. These sections were then lowered
through a hole in the floor above the site
where the caves were to be constructed.
Once in place, the separate sections were
assembled and welded together to form a
mold for high density concrete—the main
constituent of the walls. A steel beam-
work was finally laid across the top.
Concrete. The mineral barytes, instead
of the conventional gravel and sand ag-
gregates, was used in the concrete. Since
barytes concrete weighs about 216 pounds
per cubic foot as compared with the 120
to 140 pounds for conventional concrete,
the gross cost, because of higher initial
cost, added transportation costs, and add-
ed handling cost, was four to five times
the cost of ordinary concrete. However,
although a wall of identical shielding ca-
pacity made with ordinary concrete would
undoubtedly be less expensive, after con-
sidering the value of the space saved (the
shielding capacity of a material is a
function of its density) and other factors,
it was decided that the barytes concrete is
the best material in this instance.
Other than its greater density, the
physical properties of the concrete are
about the same as those of ordinary sand
and gravel concrete, and, consequently, it
was mixed and forced into its mold—the
steel shell—in the usual manner. Special
attention, however, had to be paid to the
shaking operation, since it is essential
that as little void as possible remain in the
concrete and that every part of the shell
be completely filled, if the wall is to be
an effective shield. The four feet thick
ceiling was cast with the same material.
Windows. As was stated earlier, each
cave will be equipped with three win-
dows—the same thickness as the walls.
The dimensions of the windows on the
inside of the cave will be 2 ft. 6% in. by
2 ft. 11% in. and on the outside—1 ft.
9% in. by 2 ft. 41/g in., each window
consisting of six plates of glass six inches
in thickness. The cracks between the in-
dividual plates will be filled with a min-
eral oil exhibiting similar optical proper-
ties as the glass. The film of oil will
eliminate all surface reflections.
The windows will consist of three lay-
ers of different dimensions containing
two plates of glass each. These layers will
be so arranged that the windows will be-
come larger by steps toward the inside
of the cave (see layout). Such an arrange-
ment has a double advantage in that a
wider possible range of vision will be ob-
tained, and also a radiation barrier will be
produced blocking any radiation that
might otherwise leak through the crack
between the glass and the window frame.
Cerium stabilized lead glass is used in
the windows. This type of glass consists
partly of lead oxide, and its greatest ad-
vantage over other shielding glasses lies
in its extremely high density. Small
amounts of cerium oxide are incorporated
in the glass because of its ability to retard
darkening of the glass upon exposure to
high energy radiation. The thick slabs or
glass were cast in the Herrodsburg plant
of the Corning Glass Works, and the as-
sembled windows will be installed this
spring.
Manipulators. Probably the most com-
plicated feature of the caves are the man-
ipulators. Each cave will be equipped
with a pulley type device for heavy lift-
ing and two "master-slave" manipulators
for the more intricate and delicate opera-
tions required in most scientific work
While the pulley type manipulator is
essentially a movable lifting crane, the
manual master-slave manipulators ire
delicate and sensitive instruments, and are
the result of years of study and research
The manipulators that will be installed
in the Phoenix Laboratory's caves are of
the model 8 type manufactured by tht
Central Research Laboratories in Red
Wing, Minnesota, from a design origi-
nated at the Argonne National Labora-
tory. Essentially each manipulator is a
rather intricate system of aluminum rui&gt;
ing, stainless steel cables, gears, levers,
etc., designed so that when a motion is
carried out with a handle at one end of
the mechanism, a tong at the other end
goes through a nearly identical motior
With the friction and the weight of par-
kept at a minimum, every force exerted
upon the handle produces an equal for.e
upon the tong, and, conversely, every op-
posing force exerted upon the tong .-
reflected back to the master handle, thu-
giving the operator the ability to "feel"—
by remote control. This is extremely irr-
portant when handling fragile objects or
sensitive equipment. These features p!"^
the fact that several types of tongs and
respective master handles can be easu
substituted will enable an operator to per
form almost every operation ordinaniv
done directly by hand, without giving
special thought to every motion made.
Special holes through which the con-
necting shafts of the master-slave manip-
lators and also the lifting crane enter
the cave were left in the wall above th-
double window. Intricate lead folio*
blocks have been designed to allow the
manipulators to move the width of tk

this spring.
Ventilation. In handling highly radio-
active materials ventilation becomes an
important problem. In the "caves" there
will be two intake ducts on the bottom
and one at the top in the front of the
cave. Two exhaust ducts at the bottom
and one at the top are in the back of the
cave. This particular arrangement cuts
the top to bottom wind currents to a
minimum keeping disturbance of any
work being done in front of the window
to a minimum. Each cave is kept below
atmospheric pressure so that all leakage
will be into the cave. The air going
through the exhaust ducts is first filtered
through a rough filter and then a fine fil-
ter which will remove more than 99%
of the radioactive particulate material.
The exhaust air then goes to a stack the
top of which is ten feet higher than any
building in the vicinity and let out.
Lighting and Finishing. There will be
one fluorescent light fixture at the top
of the cave and six sodium vapour lamps
around each window. The reason for
using sodium lights around the win-
dows is that it has a single wavelength
and thus on going through the thick win-
dow a simple diffraction takes place,
whereas, if ordinary lights with multiple
wave emission lengths is used a complex
diffraction pattern occurs which would
make the reading of things like scales in-
side the cave very difficult.
Amercoat 33, a special paint which
resists dilute acid solutions will be used
to finish the inside, thus allowing it to be
thoroughly hosed down. The "hot" water
and acid drains to a tank below the build-
ing where it will eventually be decon-
taminated.
The outsides of the caves have been
made as streamlined as possible by re-
cessing many fixtures.
Special Applications. Aside from being
a general purpose radiation cave where
experiments will be conducted with mate-
rials brought in from the outside for that
purpose, each cave will also be adapted
to fulfill certain more specialized duties.
The southernmost of the two caves will
be connected by a "hot" passageway di-
rectly to a well in the so called "high
gamma" area which lies adjacent to this
cave. The high gamma area is a heavily
shielded room with a deep well in its
center filled with water. A high level
gamma source, probably 5000 curies of
cobalt-60, will be stored at the bottom of
this well when it is not in actual use.
Other radioactive materials will also
probably be temporarily stored here. A
small open shaft from the cave to the well
will make possible safe and efficient
transfer of materials from the cave to
the well and vice versa, without requiring
the use of a lead container.
The second cave will be operated in
close accord with the new nuclear reactor
which the University is planning to con-
struct this year. Since this cave lies adja-
cent to the north wall of the building,

Several years ago the University of
Michigan recognized that progress in tim-
ber research and the consequent new de-
partures ensuing in the wood industries
were creating a new professional field—
wood technology. A thorough study of
the situation resulted, in 1934, in the
establishment of a special course of train-
ing, the specific purpose of which is to
prepare men to function in the wood in-
dustries in technical capacities. This train-
ing combines mechanical engineering and
wood technology. It was the first of its
kind to be initiated in the United States,
and has been approved by a number of
leading men in the industries concerned
throughout the country.
Wood technology, in the past, has been
much too narrowly thought of and de-
fined. It should now be understood as
the science or systematic knowledge of
wood and special reference to the indus-
trial utilization of this material. In this
broader sense it includes such subjects as
wood structure and identification, and the
physics, mechanics, chemistry, and path-
ology of wood. It is also concerned with
such activities as kiln drying, preservative
and fire-retardant treatment, and machin-
ing of wood, as well as with the bonding
of wood with adhesive and with processes
of various kinds whereby properties may
be modified to secure increased useful-
ness and adaptability.
The reason for the engineering-wood
technology combination may be explained
as follows. In the operation of wood-
fabricating or processing plants, the tech-
nical questions that are constantly present-
ing themselves fall broadly, and in about
equal proportion, into two categories. On
the one hand are problems concerned with
such matters as machine design, machine
efficiency, power consumption, or plant
layout, which are fundamental engineer-
ing in nature. On the other, are ques-
tions bearing on the reactions of woods
to various kiln-drying procedures, or on
optimum conditions for bonding wood
with various adhesives, or on the tech-
niques suitable for the production of
molded articles from plastic-bonded ply-
woods, or on the machining or finishing
qualities of wood, or on the chemical sea-
soning of wood, or on antishrink treat-
ments or fire-retardant processes. These
lie in the domain of wood technology.
Training in either engineering alone
or in wood technology alone will not meet
the case. Only by combining the two can
really adequate preparation for the in-
vestigator, the practitioner, or the execu-
tive in the wood industries be given.
Under normal peacetime conditions
successful completion of the course at the
University of Michigan leads in four
years to the degree of Bachelor of Sci-
ence in Wood Technology, and after an
additional year to the degree of Master
of Wood Technology. The University
also offers a Combined Curriculum in
Engineering and Wood Technology open
to students of superior scholastic ability,
under which three years in the College of
Engineering are followed by two years in
the School of Forestry and Conservation.
At the end of his first year in the School
the student qualifies for the degree of
Bachelor of Science in Engineering, and
the end of his second year for the degree
of Master of Wood Technology.
The Wood Technology Laboratory is
located directly in back of Victor
Vaughan womens residence hall on Cath-
erine Street. It is a separate building con-
taining about 20,000 square feet of floor
space which is devoted entirely to the
Wood Technology Department. Here
adequate classroom space, equipment, and
instrumentation are available for the lab-
oratory phases of the formal courses as
well as for graduate research dealing with
most types of wood technology problems.
On one floor of the laboratory, as
shown in Fig. 1, a large section is de-
voted to studies of wood structure and
identification and is equipped with such
items as class and research microscopes, a
microtone, and other accessories for pre-
paring and mounting wood sections, a
photo micrographic camera, as well as an
extensive catalogued collection of native
and foreign woods and prepared slides.
A photographic darkroom, fully equipped
for developing and printing is also on
this floor.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Adjacent to the wood structure labora-
tory is the drawing room with drawing
tables and other facilities which are used
in studies of design of wood-working
machinery.
Another section contains a large variety
of wood-glueing apparatus including nu-
merous types of pressing and testing ma-
chines, a large refrigerator for resin
storage, and instruments such as a
PH meter, a viscometer, and a pyro-
meter. This area is devoted to instruc-
tion and research in the physical and
mechanical properties of wood, hard-
boards, and chipboards. Among the items
of instrumentation and equipment used
extensively in this field are a universal
testing machine, a toughness testing ma-
chine, a forced-draft drying oven, preci-
sion balances, and electronic strain and
moisture meters.
On the ground floor of the laboratory
is an experimental forced-draft dry kiln
of two thousand board-feet capacity
equipped with many temperature, humid-
ity, and air circulation measuring devices,
used for studying the effects of variations
in drying schedules for native and for-
eign woods.
In the same area is situated a specially
designed pressure-treating plant sufficient-
ly large to hold standard railroad ties.
Creosote, water-soluble, and other wood
preservatives may be used interchange-
ably in the plant for instruction and re-
search in the protection of wood from
destructive agents such as decay, insects,
and fire. Precision fluid metering devices
jnd recording instruments make the pres-
sure-treating cylinders especially useful
for studying. The same large floor space
provides an ideal place to learn the prin-
ciples of grading hardwood and softwood
lumber. For this purpose an extensive col-
lection of boards of numerous species and
standard grades has been assembled.
The machining of wood efficiently and
accurately is undoubtedly one of the fore-
most concerns of the wood-using indus-
tries. As can be seen in Fig. 2, the lab-
oratory has many production models of
the basic types of machines which the
students use during their laboratory
courses. The machines have been special-
ly adapted so that cutting forces, cutter
efficiency, and power requirements may
be accurately determined. In recognition
of the fact that an important adjunct to
any investigation of machinability is in-
strumentation, it is equipped with excel-
lent electric power measuring and record-
ing devices-stroboscopes for accurately
determining cutting speeds and for ultra-
high speed photography of cutting ac-
tions, sensitive electronic surface analyz-
ers, and many types of precision gauges
and tools. A large variable-speed fre-
quency changer makes it possible to oper-
ate the machinery through a wide range
of speeds to study the effects of varied
cutter and feed speeds on the efficiency
of removing material as well as on the
quality of the resulting machined sur-
faces. A small but well-equipped machine
shop containing a precision engine lathe,
milling machine, and numerous saw and
knife-grinding machines makes it possible
to maintain the machinery in excellent
working condition as well as to prepare
special tools for research and class demon-
strations.
Many of the wood industries, the furni-
ture industry particularly, depend upon
the protective and decorative coatings on
their products for a large part of their

sult they allot a considerable percentage

A good job of finishing must be based
on good preparation of the article during
all phases of its manufacture. The labora-
tory has production spray painting equip-

Because the properties of wood are

WM DESIGN
OF HIGH QUALITY
TONE ARMS
by ROBERT RACY, '55 ME
Much distortion produced in modern
phonographs can be caused by an im-
properly designed pickup arm. Excess
record and stylus wear is often a product
of improper tracking and inertia forces
due to design characteristics. It is to the
advantage of the audio enthusiast to con-
sider the relative merits of the high qual-
ity tone arms to the less expensive types.
Many factors are involved which will in-
troduce excessive distortion, record and
stylus wear. Each factor will be discussed
in the analysis.
Resonance, the effect of mass and com-
pliance of the arm occurs in all tone arms.
The frequency and magnitude of this re-
sonance relative to the audio spectrum
determines one quality of the arm. In
order to achieve undistorted reproduction,
the resonant frequency must be out of the
audible range or the magnitude of the
resonant frequency must be small.
Since damping is not practical, the
resonant frequency must be changed by
altering either the mass or the compli-
ance. Tone arms used on most automatic
record changers available today suffer
from a resonant frequency at about forty-
five cycles per second. This resonance not
only produces sharp peaks in the response
at that frequency, but it also produces
distortion of the waveform. Since motor
noise from the turntable lies in this range
this effect is amplified by the tone arm
and appears in the loudspeaker as a con-
tinuous rumble. The response to this
noise can be reduced considerably by
moving the arm resonance to a frequency
lower than that of the frequency of the
turntable rumble. High quality arms in
combination with a good cartridge have a
low resonant frequency of about twenty
cycles per second.
In order to lower the resonant fre-
quency into the range of twenty cycles per
second it is necessary to increase the mass
of the arm. With this increase of arm
mass new design problems are introduced.
The most serious problem then is track-
ing.
Tracking is the ability of the stylus to
follow the recorded grooves without leav-
ing the grooves or riding on the sides
of these grooves. To obtain proper track-
ing a force normal to the record must be
applied to the stylus by the tone arm. If
this force is large the resulting pressures
will greatly increase record and stylus
wear. This force is usually reduced in
conventional arms by counterbalancing
with weights at the opposite end of thc-
arm. This method of removing the stylus
force has the disadvantage of increasing
the inertia of the arm in the vertical plane.
Since record surfaces are not always per-
fectly flat, the arm is forced by the record
to accelerate and deccelerate in the verti-
cal plane. The force required to accelerate
the arm produces an added increase in
record and stylus wear.
Before the development of high fidel-
ity records, stylus pressures were not as
important, so weight counterbalancing
was a bona fied practice. The desired re-
sults of minimum stylus and record wear
without increasing the inertia of the irm
in the vertical plane can be achieved with
spring counterbalancing or with use of
two separately pivoted arms.
Another form of arm resonance that is
secondary in importance is torsional re-
sonance. This is the effect of the arm
oscillating or twisting, about a line drawn
through the center of the arm in its long-
est axis. This form of resonance has a
two fold effect of creating tracking prob-
lems as well as peaking waveform distor-
tion well in the audible range. The gen-
erally accepted solution to this problem is
to increase the torsional rigidity of the
arm. In some of the quality arms now
being manufactured tone arms having a

porated in the design to increase the tor-
sional strength. This type of design yields
a greater torsional strength for a given
arm weight.
Perhaps a more obvious design criteria
considers the design of the arm pivots.
Any friction in the arm pivots will yield
a resulting drag that the stylus must over-
come while moving toward the center of
the record. Increasing the length of the
arm gives an effectively reduced friction
force at the stylus since the moment arm

that the friction torque acts through is
increased. It is desirable that the friction
that must be encountered be low and
have a constant value since an uneven
friction may result in erratic operation
and cause the stylus to leave the record
grooves. The solution to this problem is
precision machining, which of course
means additional cost.
Since record grooves are cut in a man-
ner so that the cutting stylus travels in a
straight line from the edge of the record
to the center, any deviation in the play-
back from a straight line will result in
waveform distortion. The stylus of a tone
arm moves in an arc since it is pivoted at
one point and thus produces this form of
distortion. To overcome the distortion the
length of the arm, the angle of offset,
and the location of the vertical pivot must
be considered. For the best results it is
necessary to adjust these factors for a

Reactor Technology
An intensive, two-week course for engi-
neers in industry who are interested in
the atomic energy field will be offered by
the University of Michigan this summer.
Called Nuclear Reactors and Radiations
in Industry, the course will run from
August 15 through 26.
It is aimed for "the engineer without
previous experiences in nuclear technology
who wishes to acquire a knowledge of
representative problems and techniques
in the rapidly-developing field."
The course will be sponsored by the
Nuclear Engineering Committee of the
U-M College of Engineering. It will be
conducted by members of the College
staff, assisted by guest lecturers.
Among the staff members will be pro-
fessors who have pioneered in various
areas in the nuclear energy field, such as
Lloyd Brownell, Henry J. Gomberg, Wil-
liam Kerr, Harold A. Ohlgren, and
John R. Sellars.
The course is viewed by its sponsors as
another step in a campus-wide effort to
implement the use of atomic power by
industry.
The tuition fee of §200 will cover the
cost of a complete set of printed course
notes, the course sponsors point out.
Lectures covering such topics as ele-
mentary nuclear thory, measurements of
nuclear radiations, interaction of radiation
and matter, and nuclear reactors and fuels
will be coordinated with laboratory dem-
onstrations, tours of University radiation
facilities, and examples of industrial ap-
plications.
Guest lecturers from industry will pre-
sent current progress and thinking in the
nuclear field.

Farm-fresh to you...
How a remarkable plastie helps bring fresher food to your table
A WONDERFULLY useful plastic called polyethylene* is
now giving a new kind of protection to food that is on
its way to your kitchen.
WHEN FOOD IS PACKED in thin, strong bags of
polyethylene, it is able to "breathe," and yet not dry
out. Because polyethylene has this peculiar advantage,
apples, carrots, and other fruits and vegetables—as well
as poultry and meat products—can reach your table
more nearly farm-fresh than ever.
POLYETHYLENE IS ONLY ONE of a number of plas-
tics produced by the people of Union Carbide to help
bring foods to you in prime condition. Some of these
plastics coat cardboard for milk cartons and frozen
food packages, while others line the tins for canned
foods and beverages.
SCIENCE "SETS A GOOD TABLE" These and other
materials produced by UCC help protect food while
growing, in storage, during preparation, when pack-
aged for your use, and when stored in your pantry or
refrigerator. This protection helps provide a more
healthful diet for all Americans.

boundary layer and keep it laminar. For
the convex surface, if a small element of
fluid is disturbed, either by roughness
or turbulence, so that it moves outward
away from the surface, the centrifical
force on it due to its velocity will be less
than that of the pressure force of the air
and it will be returned to its original
position. The pressure force decreases the
boundary layer thickness and tends to
keep it laminar. For a concave surface
the action is just the reverse of that of a
convex surface. From the standpoint of
transition, concavity of a surface is un-
desirable, but in many cases, other aero-
dynamic considerations will out weight
the transition problem and a concave
surface will be used. This is often the
case of the underside of an airfoil.
The addition of heat to the boundary
layer has an effect similar to that of an
adverse pressure gradient. Heating causes
an inflection point to develop in the ve-
locity profile and in turn causes transition
of the boundary layer. The problem of
heating is becoming increasingly im-
portant as flight speeds increase into the
trans-sonic and supersonic range. Skin
friction in these speed ranges causes heat-
ing of the aircraft surfaces. This heat is
in turn radiated to the surrounding air
and boundary layer. It is improbable that
much of the boundary layer is laminar in
the trans-sonic and supersonic speed
ranges. Much investigation remains to be
done for trans-sonic and supersonic air
flows.
Several methods exist for detecting
transition by experiment. Preference as to
which method should be used is usually
determined by the accuracy desired in the
experiment. Unless the person perform-
TURBULENT
(Continued from page 13)
ing the experiment is able to recognize
transition in the data obtained from the
experiment or while the experiment is
being performed, it may go unnoticed.
Much care must also be exercised in the
procedure used since the boundary layer
is not very thick and test instruments may
not be in the boundary layer. The type
of wind tunnel used is very important.
One having a low turbulence level is
necessary for accurate data.
The Hot Wire Anemometer method is
the most accurate of all methods used in
obtaining experimental data of air flows.
A very fine wire, having a diameter of
.0001 to .0003 inches is heated while in
the boundary layer, by an electric current.
Properly connected to an oscillograph, the
hot wire anemometer will detect very
small changes in the air velocity. A 1am-
inary boundary layer will produce a con-
stant value trace on the oscillograph while
a turbulent one will produce an irregular
trace. The slightest variation of the trace
of a laminar boundary indicates the begin-
ning of transition.
Transition may also be detected by the
use of a very small total pressure tube
moved upstream along the surface, over
which air is flowing; a drop in total pres-
sure will be evident when it passes from
a turbulent to a laminar boundary layer.
Since the boundary layer isn't very thick
care must be used in this method to use a
small tube. Usually needles similar to
hypodermic needles are used. With proper
procedure and extreme care, this method
is very accurate.
Determination of transition point by
pressure distribution is quite involved and
tedious. This method requires that pres-
sure distribution over an airfoil be ob-

tained for several different Reynolds
number. The pressure distribution data
is then plotted against the length of the
airfoil. The resulting curves will show a
slight hump at a different point on each
plot for a different Reynolds' number.
This hump is caused by transition. Obser-
vation of transition by this method is
limited by the sensitivity of the pressure
measuring equipment used. Extreme are
must be used or the transition of the
boundary layer may not be detected at all.
The task of designing an airfoil with
good transition control is one involving
the solution of many complex problems.
The usual procedure in airfoil design is
to rely quite heavily upon past experience
in previous designs. Since a complete lam-
inar boundary layer over an airfoil is not
possible, most airfoals are a compromist
in regard to the type of boundary which
will predominate. Each has its advantages
and disadvantages.
A laminar boundary airfoil has two
distinct advantages both of which are de-
sirable in an airfoil. The low drag coeffi-
cient is the main advantage of the laminar
boundary layer airfoil. Secondly, is the
relatively wide range of lift coefficient
permissible without appreciable change in
drag coefficient. Low drag characteristics
is the main reason for the development
of the laminar flow airfoil, since power
requirements are less for the aircraft.
In the most carefully designed laminar
flow airfoil, the boundary layer never
remains laminar over more than 50% of
the length of the airfoil. Even this amount
will appreciably decrease the drag of the
wing. The decrease in drag of a laminar
airfoil will result in greater operational
efficiency of an aircraft.
Along with the advantage of low
drag characteristics of the laminar airfoil
is one serious disadvantage. This is the
low coefficient of lift, which doesn't make
this type of airfoil suitable for violent
maneuvers such as a fighter aircraft would
perform. However in several instances,
a laminar airfoil has been used with great
success on fighter planes. In general this
airfoil is seldom used for aircraft which
will perform violent maneuvers. Another
disadvantage is the bad stall characteristn.
This type of airfoil stalls rather abruptly
and with little warning. The undesirable
stall is caused by the abrupt separation of
the laminar boundary layer from the winf.
at high angles of attack. By proper design

... the world's most versatile hydraulic proving ground
When you make pumping equipment that has to stand up and
deliver year after year anywhere in the world, you've got to be sure
it will perform as specified.
That's why we built one of the world's largest hydraulic test
stands at our plant in Harrison, New Jersey. Here, over a half-
acre "lake," we can check the performance of anything from a
fractional horsepower unit to pumps handling over 100,000 gallons
a minute. When you realize there are thousands of sizes and types
of centrifugal pumps alone, you get an idea of the versatility we
had to build into our proving-ground.
Naturally, our new test equipment is a big help to our research
engineers, as well as our customers. Now they get performance
data on products quickly and accurately. Using it, we can save
months, even years, in developing new Worthington fluid and air-

BETTER THINGS FOR BETTER LIVING . . . THROUGH CHEMISTRY
WATCH "CAVALCADE OF AMERICA" ON TELEVISION
The answer to that is easy, Don, if you mean initial assign-
ments. Generally speaking, a graduate's first assignment is
influenced by his previous training and his expressed interest
in a particular type of work. Whenever possible, Du Pont
assigns a man to the type of work he is trained for and wants
—he'll do better in any field if he's highly interested. For
example, my master's thesis was on the use of explosives,
and my first Du Pont assignment was a study of the effi-
ciency of explosives.
But experience on the job really constitutes new training.
You learn about other branches of science and engineering—
you broaden your horizons through daily contacts with
men having other skills. The result is that arbitrary divi-
sions between technical branches gradually dissolve, and
you become ready for new assignments and new responsi-
bilities—even outside your original field. In my own case, I
developed quite a bit of skill in mechanical and civil engi-
neering techniques when I was called upon to supervise the
"shooting" of an experimental tunnel for the evaluation of
new explosives—even though my original training was in
mining engineering.
Of course, specialization in a definite field may be con-
tinued if the man specifically wants it and reveals a talent
for it. The beet opportunities for that are in research and
development. Naturally, the value of this kind of work is
also recognized at Du Pont.
So, no matter what your initial assignment may be, Don,

WRRC Director Warns Against
Space Platform 1
A University of Michigan guided mis-
sile expert has warned that proposed plans
to establish "space platform" 1,000 miles
above the earth would cripple the national
defense effort.
Prof. Harry H. Goode, director of the
IN THE NEWS
(Continued from page 20)
four billion dollars a year for ten to 15
years.
Space platform backers feel the satel-
lite would serve as an observation post
over the entire world and as the essential
jumping-off place for interplanetary jour-
nies. At an altitude of 1,000 miles, the
"man-made moon" would circle the earth
at about 16,000 miles per hour. It would
coast in the frictionless vacuum continu-
ously held from flying off into space by
the pull of earth's gravity.
Professor Goode said development of
the platform would call for the efforts of
between 4,000 and 40,000 persons, half
of them highly-skilled technicians needed
in present defense work, he added.
North American Aviation
Rocket power developed by guided missile engines are measured on a static test
stand at North American Aviation's Propulsion Field Laboratory in the Santa Susana
Mountains north of Los Angeles. Rocket power plants capable of delivering, over a
short period of time, jet horsepower substantially greater than the total energy
output of the Hoover Dam have been built and tested by personnel of the com-
pany's Missile and Control Equipment organization.
University's Willow Run Research Cen-
ter, cautioned against an all-out program
to build the man-made satellite during an
interview over U-M radio station
WUOM.
He underscored the "staggering cost"
in dollars and scientific manpower re-
quired for the project, which is advocated
by space travel proponents.
The technical problems involved can
be solved, he said, but in an all-out effort
this would be only at the expense of about
This demand for experts from such
fields as electronics, guided missiles, nu-
clear research, infrared spectrometry, op-
tics and many others would drain the na-
tion of scientific ability, he warned.
"Thousands of the best technical men
and women in the country would have to
devote full time to this single project, and
we are already behind the Soviets in the
training of such persons."
"The satellite is possible. But person-
ally, I don't think we want to run the
risk—as a nation in a hostile world—of
falling behind in the vital fields of nu-
clear weapons, aircraft and missile de-
velopment. The cost of the space platform
implies that we will," Prof. Goode point-
ed out.
He reminded his listeners that during
World War II the Germans put "too
many scientific eggs in a single basket"
when they concentrated on developing
the V-2 rocket. Even though German sci-
entists knew the potential of the atomic
bomb, their best efforts went into the
V-2."
Prof. Goode listed some of the hurdles
to be overcome if such a platform were
to be constructed:
1. A mother rocket, three-fourths the
size of the Empire State Building and
weighing 7,000 tons would have to be
built to carry sections of the space plat-
form to an altitude of 1,000 miles.
2. Shortly after take-off, the rocket
would have to attain a speed of 18,000
miles an hour, propelled by enough fuel
to fill 100 freight cars.
3. Since humans must be sent up to
assemble the platform, the rocket must be
highly reliable. It must be able to support
life in the face of temperature difficulties,
lack of air, bombardment by meteors, lack
of gravitation and a host of similar diffi-
culties.
4. At least 20 and perhaps 100 firings
would be required to put together the
space platform.
Silicon Solar Batteries May Furnish
Power for Household Use
Solar batteries of silicon probably will
someday furnish enough power for house-
hold use in sunny areas, but do not ap-
pear practical for powering autos and
other vehicles, a General Electric Company
scientist has predicted.
However, he said that there is no way
of predicting when such systems would
be economically feasible.
Dr. R. L. Cummerow, scientist at the
Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory near
Schenectady, N.Y., said that there is
enough surface area available on house
roofs to make this energy conversion
method practical. But he said that the
optical method would not provide suffi-
cient power for vehicles.

proper housing design is essential to proper performance
The Torrington Needle Bearing
offers many design and opera-
tional advantages for a great
variety of products and equip-
ment. For example, a Needle
Bearing has greater rated radial
load capacity in relation to its
outside diameter than any other
type of anti-friction bearing. It is
extremely light in weight. And it
is easy to install and lubricate.
Housing Maintains
Bearing Roundness
The housing is an essential part
of the Needle Bearing assembly.
Care should be taken to provide
a straight, round housing bore to
the recommended tolerances.
The thin, surface-hardened
outer shell of the Needle Bearing
acts as the outer race surface as
well as a retainer for the rolls.
This shell assumes the shape of
the housing into which it is
pressed. Consequently, the hous-
ing bore should be round, and the
housing so designed that it will
carry the radial load imposed on
the bearing without distortion.
Housing Material
Determines Bore Size
The specified housing bore dimen-
sions for any given material
should be maintained in order to
give the proper running clearance
Needle Bearings require simple
housings. If the housing bores are
held to proper size, accurate oper-
ation and high radial capacity are
assured.

between the needle rollers and
the shaft, and to assure sufficient
press fit to locate the bearing
firmly.
When designing housings of
materials that are soft or of low
tensile strength, allowance should
be made for the plastic flow of the
material when the bearing is
pressed into place. Bore dimen-
sions in such cases should be less
than standard. Needle Bearings
can be pressed directly into phe-
nolic or rubber compounds, al-
though metal inserts are recom-
mended.

AIRBORNE RADAR .
Bendix* Airborne Radar, a device carried right in the
airplane to spot storms miles ahead, has been used by
the military for several years. Now Bendix is supplying
it to airline and company-owned aircraft.

shows their size and intensity.
In the small photo above, for example, you can see
white areas which are a line of storms. Those with black
centers represent great turbulence. With only a slight
change in course the pilot avoided these storms.
Airlines are buying Bendix Airborne Radar beca
it makes possible a more comfortable, swifter ride c

(Continued from page 22) It
this stall characteristic may be improved
by allowing the boundary layer to change
from laminar to turbulent at high angles
of attack. This improves the stall because
the turbulent boundary layer is able to
resist separation better than the laminar
boundary layer.
Use of the conventional airfoil is more
common than the laminar boundary layer
airfoil. The big disadvantage of the turbu-
lent boundary layer airfoil is the high
drag coefficient. Even so, this type of air-
foil is the most used in aircraft. The tur-
bulent boundary layer airfoil has been
used since the invention of the airplane.
Not until the late 1930s did the laminar
boundary layer airfoil come into use.
The big advantages of the turbulent
boundary layer airfoil are its high lift
coefficient and excellent stall character-
istics. Over a wide range of angles of at-
tack the lift coefficient is higher than
that of a laminar boundary layer airfoil.
Consequently this type of airfoil is used
in aircraft where heavy loads are to be
carried and violent maneuvers are per-
formed. The excellent stall characteristic
is due to the ability of the turbulent
boundary layer to resist separation of air
flow over the airfoil. The stall doesn't
take place abruptly, but gradually with
wing vibration to give warning that lift is
about to be lost over the wing.
Designing the turbulent boundary
layer airfoil is somewhat simpler than
designing a laminar one. Less attention is
paid in attempting to hold a favorable
pressure gradient over the entire length
of the airfoil. In this type of airfoil low
drag coefficient is sacrificed for a higher
lift coefficient. From the preceding it can
be seen that before designing an airfoil,
all requirements must be carefully weigh-
ed and often times sacrifices must be
made. Much research in boundary layers
is being carried on at present.

Scientific Computing Laboratory at Co-
lumbia University. His work was carried
out at KAPL, operated by G. E. for the
Atomic Energy Commission.
He pointed out that a practical type of
solar energy converter might be made to
yield up to three times home power needs
"to take care of emergencies, peak loads
or protracted spells of dark weather."
This capacity might also have to be in-
creased to take care of the fact that the
efficiency predicted for such household
solar batteries would not be feasible, he
said.
The sun-gathering surface of such a
solar converter would take up 30 to 100
square feet to produce enough household
power, the G-E scientist estimated.
"This area and more is very easily at-
tained on a roof, with most home roofing
areas running in the order of 1,000 square
feet," he stated. "Thus, given a good sup-
ply of high-purity silicon and mass pro-
duction methods, there is no technological
reason why such a system should not
work."
He cautioned, however, that "it is diffi-
cult to predict what may be the economic
feasibility of such systems because of the
present day manufacturing costs and the
fact that silicon of exacting purity has not
been produced on a large scale."
"However," he continued, "there is no
doubt about the abundance of the raw
material and so it seems that if there is a
large potential market for it, ways and
means of production will be found which
will make it economically feasible."
He pointed out that the comparatively
large surface areas needed seem to rule out
these solar batteries for use in autos .md
other vehicles.
To operate any vehicle on only 10
horsepower he said, would require at least
500 square feet of surface area for soak-
ing up enough sun rays.
"Even if one could raise the efficiency
by a factor of two, this would not suffice,"
he said. "One would also have to concen-
trate the incoming radiation by a factor of
10 and thus cut the necessary surface area
to 25 square feet. The optical system to
accomplish such a feat would, to put it
mildly, be costly and bulky."
25-Million-Doilar "Atom Smasher"
To Be Built
Physicists representing a newly-formed
organization of eight Midwestern uni-
(Continued from page 30)
versities are meeting at the University of
Michigan each week this winter to design
a 25-million-dollar "atom smasher" the
group plans to build somewhere in the
Midwest.
Members of a design committee of the
Midwestern Universities Research Asso-
ciation (MURA), they are drawing up
plans for a giant proton accelerator four
times as powerful as any in existence.
With it, they believe MURA scientists
can regain a prominent place in the new
and important field of high-energy
physics, after "lagging seriously" behind
East and West Coast groups in this re-
search.
In sessions filling two or three days a
week, they are discussing a doughnut-
shaped accelerator 600 feet in diameter
and nearly one-half mile around. It would
be capable of whirling atomic particles so
fast they attain energies between 20 and
30 billion electron volts before crashing
into target atoms.
By studying the results of such colli-
sions, physicists gather valuable data
about the mysterious particles and forces
that make up all matter. The construction
of increasingly powerful machines has
added to this knowledge, the size of the
machine being limiting factor in the
energy it imparts to the "projectiles."
The largest existing accelerator, the
University of California's Bevatron, is
160 feet across and is rated at six billion
electron volts.
A super-energy machine of a size com-
parable to the proposed MURA accelera-
tor is in the early stages of construction
at the Brookhaven National Laboratories
on Long Island.
The Association hopes construction of
its atom smasher can begin in 1956, al-
though the site and method of financing
the machine have yet to be determined.
An estimated five years will be required
to build the device at a centrally-located
point, the Association estimates.
Eight institutions have joined forces
to plan and construct the accelerator: the
Universities of Illinois, Iowa, Michigan,
Minnesota and Wisconsin, Purdue Uni-
versity, Indiana University and Iowa State
College.
The group was incorporated in Septem-
ber, after member institutions recognized
that construction and operation of a ma-
chine large enough for effective work in
high-energy physics called for an invest-
ment in funds and manpower too great
for any single university to bear.
The proposed accelerator will be made
up primarily of ponderous magnets—
10,000 tons of them and power sources
arranged in series in a circle. A hollow
"racetrack" will run through the center I
of the magnets, and particles will be fed J
into the inside lane.
At each power source the projectiles
will receive a 10,000-volt push" until
they are circling the track 400,000 times
a second. As they gain speed, they will
move to the outer lanes, held in their
proper paths by the magnetic fields.
After reaching their maximum veloci-
ties, they will be channeled off to crash
into targets, such as small samples of
various elements.
Not only will the particles in the
MURA machine attain tremendous veloc-
ities, they will bombard target atoms in
a more rapid-fire beam, the physicists cal-
culate.
This is the expected result of a discov-
ery by the group that a magnet can be
made that will hold simultaneously in
their proper orbits particles ranging from
high to low speeds.
In present-day systems, the magnetic
fields must be shifted back and forth to
control particles of different energies,
and an intermittent beam of particles is
produced.
Because the magnets in the MURA ac-
celerator will receive particles at all times,
it will be able to provide 100 times as
many particles per second as contem-
porary machines, the physicists point out.
At the same time, the complex equipment
required to shift magnetic fields will be
eliminated.
Since the interactions of most interest
to nuclear physicists occur only rarely
during the bombardment of a target, this
increase in the production of particles
means there will be a greater likelihood
of such an event happening in a given
period of time.
In other words, the beams of particles
produced at great expense in the accelera-
tor will be more efficiently utilized.
Moreover, it appears that the new prin-
ciple—called FFAG for Fixed Field, Al-
ternating Gradient—can be adapted to
existing accelerators of lower energies, as
well, increasing their power "several
orders of magnitude," the design group
reports.

pplication of Insulation
and Jacket Compounds
lcanized mill-mixed rubber insulating compounds may be
:d to conductors and cables by either the strip insulating or
&gt;ion processes. There are two modifications of the extrusion
ss depending on the method used for vulcanizing the rubber
its application to the conductor, namely, the pan cure process
le continuous cure process. Laytex insulating compounds are
:d to conductors by the repeated or continuous dipping process.
INSULATION—In the strip insulating process, the compound is
iered to the desired thickness and backed with talc or a paper,
or metallic tape to prevent adhesion of successive layers dur-
rocessing. The rubber sheet and tape are cut into strips of a
slightly greater than the circumference of the conductor to be
ted, and each strip is taken up in a separate roll. A strip and the
ictor are then fed into the circular opening formed by aligning
;ircular grooves in the outer surfaces of two rolls whose circum-

ferenccs contact. The rolls are driven in opposite directions, thus
folding the strip longitudinally about the conductor and pressing
its edges in firm contact. The tape is left on the wire during vulcani-
zation. If made of a suitable weatherproof material it may be per-
manent, but if made of metal it must be removed after vulcanization.
The strip-insulated, taped conductor is generally taken up on reels
for vulcanization.
EXTRUSION—In the extrusion process the rubber insulating com-
pound is applied to the conductor in an extrusion machine similar
to the strainer described under the preparation of rubber compounds.
The head of the machine supports a guide and die and provides a
passage for the compound from the screw through the guide and die
assembly to its point of application to the conductor. The guide holds
the conductor centered with the respect to the die. The die contains an
opening approximately equal to the diameter of the insulation and

be obtained. The guide and die are so located that there is an an-
nular space between them through which the rubber compound
reaches the conductor.
The driven screw of the extruder forces the unvulcanized com-
pound through the guide and die assembly around the conductor.
The equipment is provided with a driven take-up capstan which
pulls the conductor through the machine and a revolving pan in
which the rubber-covered conductor is laid. Successive layers of the
covered conductor are separated with finely divided talc to prevent
adhesion of successive layers during vulcanization. A tape may be
applied over the insulation on larger conductors before vulcaniza-
tion to assist in maintaining concentricity of the insulation with
the conductor.
Rubber or rubber-like jackets are applied to rubber insulated
single conductor cables or over the assembly of multiple conductor
insulated cables by the extrusion process. Such jacketed cables are

taken up in pans of talc as described for insulated conductors. A
continuous lead sheath is applied over the unvulcanized jacket com-
pound and the lead covered cable taken up on reels for vulcanization.
VULCANIZATION—The pans or reels containing the unvulcanized
rubber insulated conductor or jacketed cable are then placed in a
vulcanizing chamber where they are subjected to steam at the re-
quired pressure and for the required time to suitably vulcanize the
rubber. The pressure is then slowly reduced to atmospheric pressure
and the pans or reels removed from the vulcanizer and allowed to
cool. The insulated conductors are then removed from the pans.
This handling of the insulated conductor in pans through the extru-
sion and vulcanizing processes accounts for the term "pan cure
process". Non-permanent tapes are then removed from strip insu-
lated conductors and the lead tube from the jacketed cables.
CONTINUOUS CURE PROCESS—The continuous cure process employs
a standard extrusion machine similar to that used in the pan cure
process, but equipped with a modified head to which a vulcanizing
tube is attached and provided with means for automatically control-
ling the temperature of the cylinder, screw and head.
The head differs from that used in the pan cure process in that
the guide and die are mechanically centered with respect to each other
and the compound space surrounding them is smaller. Centering of
the guide and die is obtained by the use of accurately machined
holders which fit snugly into perfectly centered openings in the
head. This provides centering of the insulation or jacket compou
at all times without adjustment by the operator. The compound spt
in the head is reduced to prevent premature vulcanizing of t
highly accelerated compounds used in this process. Automatic cc
trol of the temperature of the cylinder, screw and head is requii
for successful extrusion of such compounds.
The vulcanizer attached to the tubing machine consists of a
inch steel pipe jacketed with a properly insulated 3-inch pipe anc
approximately 125 feet in length. Vulcanizing steam pressure
maintained in the annular space between the vulcanizing tube a
jacket to insure immediate attainment of the vulcanizing tempe
ture when steam is admitted to the vulcanizer tube. The vulcanize:
provided with a splice box adjacent to the tubing machine anc
suitable seal at the opposite end.
The driven screw of the extruder forces the unvulcanized co
pound through the guide and die assembly around the conduc
or cable and directly into vulcanizer containing steam at 225 pou
pressure. Highly accelerated compounds capable of vulcanizing
a few seconds are used so that the process can be operated at ei
nomical speeds. The speed of travel of a covered conductor or cal
and the acceleration of the compound are so adjusted that the
sulation or jacket is properly vulcanized while traveling the lenj
of the vulcanizer. The vulcanized insulated conductor or jacket
cable is taken up on a suitable reel directly from the vulcaniz
The term "Continuous cure process" follows from the fact that l
insulation or jacket is applied and vulcanized in one operation.
APPLICATION OF LATEX—The application of latex insulation consi
of passing the coated conductor beneath the surface of a latex co
pound from which it is brought vertically into a suitable dryi
chamber. It continues to travel vertically in the chamber until the fi
is dry. It is then returned for the application of a second layer
compound. This alternate dipping and drying is continued until
wall of the required thickness is applied and dried. The amount
insulation deposited per application depends on the conductor si:
the viscosity and temperature of the latex compound and the spe
to which the conductor travels.
The conductor, covered with the required thickness of dri
unvulcanized latex compound then passes through a vulcanizi
chamber where the insulation is vulcanized and continues throu
a talc applicator to the take-up reel. This process is thus a continue
one in that the application of the insulation to the conductor a
its vulcanization are accomplished in one operation.

A GOOD ENGINEER?
You young men will be given much
sound, practical and concrete advice about
how to look for and how to secure a job.
I am going to take the calculated risk of
telling you bluntly what is on the minds
of many of us when we evaluate you as
potential employees. We disguise this in-
terest with carefully worded sociological
and psychological questions, but what we
want to know, what we must learn, is:
Do you really want to be an engineer?
There are many opportunities today for
the young man who sincerely loves his
profession and can demonstrate his abili-
ties. There always are. The men I know
who graduated during the early thirties
in the midst of the depression thought
they had a pretty tough time, but 90%
of them were located in positions within
six months after graduation. Many of
them now hold very responsible positions
in industry and in the technical world.
Their chief characteristic then, as now,
was that they really loved their pro-
fession.
by DR. DONALD B. KEYES of
ARTHUR D. LITTLE, INC.
Today, however, there seems to be
generated in the minds of our college
graduates, especially our engineers, a
philosophy peculiar to the times. Person-
nel directors interviewing men in our
colleges tell me that you are inclined
to inquire first of all, not about the char-
acter of the job, but about pension plans
and fringe benefits.
Even if you have a pension in your
old age, it will probably appear inade-
quate from your viewpoint. A research
engineer who recently retired as the exe-
cutive of a large corporation told me
that now, although his retirement allow-
ance is $45,000 a year, he is forced to
continue to work for a living. Over the
years he has acquired some rather expen-
sive tastes and, because of the tax sit-
uation and inflation, he cannot maintain
his standard of living on his present pen-
sion, even though the size of his pension
may look large to most of us.
Financial security must not be your
primary objective. A rewarding career is
dependent upon this fundamental con-
sideration: Will the type of engineering
you have elected offer you the incentive,
the curiosity and the urge to work hard
and "go places."
It has been my privilege to know quite
a few distinguished engineers. Looking
Dr. Donald B. Keyes, whose chief interest has always been the guidance of young
chemists and chemical engineers, is the New York representative of Arthur D. Little,
Inc., industrial research and engineering organization of Cambridge, Massachusetts,
and is a consultant to the Research Committee of the National Association of Manu-
facturers and to the Heyden Chemical Corporation.
He received his B.S. from the University of New Hampshire in 1913, his M.A. in
1914 from Columbia University, and his Ph.D. in 1917 from the University of Cali-
fornia. Since then he has received two honorary degrees from the University of New
Hampshire and the Stevens Institute of Technology.
As a chemical engineer, he worked with the Beckman &amp; Linden Corporation and
with U. S. Industrial Alcohol and U. S. Industrial Chemical Companies, becoming
Research Director of the latter company in 1924.
He left industry in 1926 to teach chemical engineering at the University of Illinois
and soon became head of that department. Shortly before the start of World War II,
he was called to Washington for consulting and supervisory tasks in the Government.
In 1945 he returned to industry as the vice president in charge of planning and de-
velopment of the Heyden Chemical Corporation.
Dr. Keyes is a member of many professional societies such as the American Chemi-
cal Society, the American Institute of Chemical Engineers, the Commercial Chemical
Development Association, etc., and is president of the American Institute of Chemists.
back over the years, I know of only one
of my acquaintances who seems to have
acquired real financial security. The state
takes care of him and will do so as long
as he lives. He paid a very high price for
this security, but in fairness to this in-
dividual, I must say that he did not wish
it this way.
On the other hand, taking a typical
example of one of my friends who has
been very successful in the engineering
field, I know of no time when he was
actually financially secure. After working
up as general manager of a company, he
decided that the future of this company
was not too good; it was in a very spec-
ialized field. He then became a college
professor.
It was quite obvious to me that, al-
though he was one of the finest professors
I had ever had the pleasure of listening
to in the engineering field, he would be
unhappy if he stayed in that position too
long. Evidently, his thoughts were along
similar lines, for during World War I he
became the president of a war company.
With the aid of a very competent staff
of young people, he developed this com-
pany to such an extent that it became one
of the greatest chemical companies of its
day. The financial backers of this com-
pany, however, did not appreciate the
vision of my friend. When he discovered
that he could develop the company no
further, he promptly lost interest, resign-
ed, and became a consulting engineer.
It wasn't long before another concern,
wishing to develop the chemical end of

Solves Tough Refinery Problem
The men who design modern oil refineries
need specific information about temperature
distributions in different parts of pressure
vessels. Such information, essential to safety
and efficient operation, is often extremely
difficult to obtain by conventional mathemat-
ical methods.
Scientists at Standard Oil's Whiting lab-
oratories recently developed and built an
electrical analogue capable of simulating spe-
cific conditions within a refinery unit still in
the design stage. Using this device, they could
determine in advance the temperature dis-
tribution in the joint between two pressure
vessels having a common head. Thus they
were able to duplicate in 20 seconds the heat
stress picture within the unit during an 8 hour
start-up to shut-down period.
Creative scientific thinking made possible
this constructive achievement by engineers
who have chosen to build their careers at
Standard Oil.

their business, hired my friend. For many
years he gave all that he had to the de-
velopment of this group. His success was
phenomenal, and today this company is
one of the truly great chemical concerns
in the world. He remained active, upon
request, long after his retirement age.
When he finally retired, he still retained
an active interest. Today he is still active
and still very happy.
I—1
At no time in his career, as far as I
know, has he ever sought to work for
his own financial security, but has given
his all to the development of every or-
ganization with which he has been con-
nected. It should be remembered, too,
that he liked what he was doing, and
when he didn't, he changed to a new job
that he did enjoy.
Shortly after World War II, another
friend of mine, prominent in war work as
an engineer, joined one of the smaller
research units of a large company. After
three months he quit. He could not stand
the "atmosphere." He found men in their
early twenties who were not interested in
creating anything. Merely interested in
their pay, their fringe benefits, and their
old-age security, they were actually look-
ing forward to the time when they could
retire and quit working for a living. He
told me that this atmosphere just got on
his nerves, so much so that, although he
was older than his colleagues and liked
his particular job, he could not work
there any longer.
One of the best examples of a success-
ful industrialist, an engineer whom I
knew in the old days, was Herbert Dow,
the founder of the Dow Chemical Com-
pany. If one reads the history of this
company, one is impressed with the fact
that its founder not only was seemingly
uninterested in personal profit, but in
the profits of the company. He took the
attitude that a company's growth depend-
ed on its ability to produce new products
useful to the public at a price the public
could afford to pay. He apparently reason-
ed that if one was successful in creating
these new products at a price, the profits
would come automatically—which they
did. Today, the Dow Chemical Company
stands out as one of the truly great
creative and profitable enterprises. I doubt
whether the late Herbert Dow ever en-
visioned the enormous growth that has
taken place as a result of his simple and
practical principle.
The same principles was applied by
another old friend of mine, who started
his first company with $2243 when he
was seventeen years of age, and developed
an "empire" worth, at the time of his
death, over $25 million. This man told me
on several occasions that the love of crea-
tion, and not of money, was his guiding
principle. He told me that large profits
obtained in a single year through the
sudden development of a new product
were always embarrassing to him, as his
stockholders expected him to re-invest
this sum immediately to make an equal
percentage profit—something that usually
cannot be done.
Permit me to point out that the philos-
ophy of these two men, so dissimilar in
background and education, was a desire
to seize every opportunity to create for
the benefit of the public. They obtained
their enjoyment in hard work and during
their working hours. If either one of
them at any time had fringe benefits of
any description, I certainly do not know
what they were.
The enormous amount of energy
Edison spent not only in creating but in
promoting electrical engineering develop-
ments in order to satisfy the public is
still appreciated. Many years ago the
courts decided that the Edison patents on
the moving picture machine were the basic
ones, although three satisfactory moving
picture machines had already been invent-
ed and developed by other persons prior
to Edison's. But these three had been
"abandoned." The court pointed out that
Edison had not abandoned his invention
but had spent an enormous amount of
time, energy, and money in seeing to it
that the public received the benefits. It
was no more than human for the court
to agree to give the credit to Edison
rather than the prior inventors. Creation
for the benefit of the public is what the
public wants and incidentally, what they
are willing to pay for.
One must not only love engineering,
but use one's knowledge and energy for
the creation of something that is di-
rectly or indirectly of benefit to all.
My suggestion to you who are graduat-
ing from our engineering colleges is to
be certain when you discuss a position in
industry to find out just what it is you are
supposed to do on the job and then de-
termine for yourself whether or not you
would enjoy doing that particular type
of work.
If by chance you know what you would
like to do, be sure to tell the personnel
man your thoughts. He is eager to place
you in the position in which you will do
well, for his success as a procurer of
young engineers depends on his ability to
discover your basic interests and to place
you in the position which will give you
the opportunity you desire.
The capable young man with a sound
educational background, with the desire
to augment his knowledge throughout
his lifetime, with a love for his work,
and with an ardent desire to create for the
benefit of mankind, should find unlimited
opportunities in the engineering fields.
Do you really want to be an engineer?
Once upon a time, as the story goes,
the fence between Heaven and Hell
broke down. Satan appeared at his side
of the broken section and called out to
St. Peter; "Hey, St. Peter, since all the
engineers are over on your side, how
about sending a few to fix the fence?"
"Sorry," replied St. Peter, "my men
are too busy to fix fences."
"Well, then," said Satan, "I'll have
to sue you if you don't."
St. Peter: "Guess you win; you've all
the lawyers on your side."

Navy Demon Sets New World Record
Big Fighter Reaches 10,000 Feet
in 71 Seconds
A U. S. Navy F3H-1N Demon, manu-
factured by the McDonnell Aircraft Cor-
poration, established a new unofficial
climb record of 71 seconds to 10,000
feet in a recent flight from Lambert-St.
Louis Municipal Airport. The announce-
ment was made today by McDonnell that
the previous record of 73 seconds has
been bettered.
Piloted by Chester V. Braun, McDon-
nell Experimental Test Pilot, the single-
jet Demon was timed from standing start
to 10,000 feet. The 71-second figure was
verified by instrumentation in the fighter
and by one aerial and two ground ob-
servers.
The F3H-1N is powered by a single
Westinghouse J-40 turbojet engine. It is
an all-weather, high-performance carrier-
based fighter which combines interceptor
speed and fighter maneuverability with
the payload of an attack bomber.
Thin wings and tail surfaces of the
Demon are swept sharply back to give
the fighter high operational speeds and
the ability to get to combat altitude
quickly.
Although the new world record was
set by the F3H-IN model Demon, Mc-
Donnell also has under production an
F3H-2N model which is powered by a
newer and more powerful Allison J-71
turbojet engine. The new Demon also in-
corporates many other improvements in

Electric Company formally opened a new
100,000-square-foot" Systems Center" for
its Heavy Military Electronic Equipment
Department.
The center will serve as headquarters
for the company's development and man-
ufacturing operations on powerful, exten-
sive electronic "nerve centers" for mili-
tary use.
"Modern warfare is becoming so com-
plex and fast-moving that electronic de-
vices must do far more than simply pre-
sent a military commander with bare in-
formation such as an image on a radar
scope," declared John J. Farrell, general
manager of the HMEE Department, at
the opening.
"For example, a typical electronic air
defense system only begins its work by
detecting an incoming bomber," he said.
"The system first searches for and lo-
cates the plane. Then it tracks this target,
predicts its position, computes all the
factors necessary for fire control, and
finally aims and fires the anti-aircraft
weapons."
Such an electronic defense system, he
continued, employs radar, computers, tar-
get sighting and ranging devices, and the
necessary communications equipment to
link the entire operation together.
"Timing and accuracy for such a co-
ordinated defense operation are possible
only through a well-integrated electronic
system," he said; "a system which does
the entire job, eliminating duplication and
unnecessary equipment and simplifying
the operation."
The new two-building center opened
today will house Mr. Farrell's office, and
space for over 700 of the HMEE Depart-
ment's 3,300 employees in the Syracuse
area. They previously worked at other
locations here.
The center represents about one-fifth
of the department's total floor space in
the Syracuse area.
The department carries on development
and production programs for all services
—Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine
Corps.
Its major programs are in the military
fields of air defense, ground warfare,
communications, anti-submarine opera-
tions, stategic air operations, missile con-
trol, radiation instrumentation, air naviga-
tion and traffic control and components
and circuitry.
The department also has a unique
world-wide product service program
which comprises field service, moderniza-
tion overhaul and supply assistance,
product analysis, technical training and
publications for the Armed Forces.

TONE ARMS
(Continued from page 19)
given arm length. Since a long arm will
produce less curvature of stylus motion
relative to the vertical pivot, this design
feature must be included in a quality arm.
The last and least important design
feature of modern arms is the reduction
of side thrust. Side thrust is the force
produced at the stylus, acting toward the
center of the record and is caused by the
combination of stylus friction on the rec-
ord and the geometry of the arm location.
As the record moves under the stylus it
tends to pull the stylus along with the
record and results in a moment that yields
a reaction force on the side of the stylus.
If the arm were infinitely long there
would be no such effect, but of course this
is impractical. Since side thrust is re-
duced with increased arm length the dis-
tance from the pivot to the stylus is
made as large as practical. The results arc-
reduced record and stylus wear.
In addition to the technical require-
ments, satisfactory performance from the
user's standpoint involves convenience,
ease of handling, and assurance of a long
period of usefulness.
There should be included in the design
of the arm, provisions for easy mounting
together with heightening and levelling
adjustments. There should also be a con-
venient method of adjusting the stylus
pressure. The arm must so be constructed
that it will accept any or almost all of
the standard cartridges now being manu-
factured. Since there are many cartridges
available, a slight modification may be
necessary and can be tolerated.

WELDED STEEL
DESIGNS ALWAYS
LOWER COSTS
By knowing how to use welded steel
in modern product designs, you can
lower manufacturing costs up to 50%.
Here is how:
Material Cost is less—It's a fact . . .
steel is three times stronger than
iron, two and a half times as rigid.
Where strength alone is needed, one-
third the metal is necessary. When
rigidity is important, less than half the
material is required. But steel costs
only one-third as much per pound.
Steel is more easily placed where it
can carry more load per pound of
metal. As a result, ultimate savings
with steel are limited only by the
resourcefulness of the designer.
Manufacture is Simpler—Fewer man-
hours ... simpler, less costly produc-
tion tools are needed to manufacture
products from steel. By proper de-
sign, many operations needed for
machining castings can be eliminated
entirely. Assembly operations can
be simplified ... finishing and clean-
ing manhours reduced substantially.
Products designed in steel have a
modern appearance to improve sell-
ing appeal while reducing costs on
an average of 50% according to field
reports.

Welded Detign Saves 50% on motor gear
bousing. Original cast construction weighed
17}% more... required 90% more machining.
Cost Down 57% on machine
stand by change to welded
steel. Also eliminates for-
mer milling and drilling
on former castings.

ning for work on a subcontract basis.
JAMES N. LANDIS
A native of Champaign, Illinois, Mr.
Landis received his engineering education
at the University of Michigan, where he
received a B.S. degree in mechanical en-
gineering in 1922. He served as an in-
structor in trigonometry, analytical geom-
etry and calculus in this institution prior
to graduation.
In the year following completion of his
studies, he was employed as a tool de-
signer and as an engineering assistant in
inventory in the automobile and public
power and telephone fields.
In 1923 he became asociated with the
Brooklyn Edison Company, Brooklyn,
New York, as technical assistant to the
mechanical, research, investigating and
plant equipment engineers. His work in-
volved the mechanical design, construc-
tion, and operational problems of initial
operation of the company's generating
station, substations and commercial prop-
erties.
Mr. Landis continued in this work for
the following 13 years, and was promoted
successively to the positions of assistant
mechanical engineer, and mechanical engi-
neer in charge of all of the above opera-
tions.
In 1937 he was made manager of the
Contract Control and Inspection Depart-
ment, which he organized for the purpose
of specifying, ordering, receiving and in-
stalling all generating equipment for the
Consolidated Edison Company of New
York.
From 1938 to 1948 Mr. Landis served
as assistant mechanical engineer for Con-
solidated Edison, in charge of structural
and mechanical layout and engineering
design of all power plant installations on
the system.
He has been associated with the Bechtel
Corporation of San Francisco, California,
since 1948. He joined this company as
chief power engineer in charge of all
engineering, layout and design of steam
power plants. In the course of this work,
he organized the Power Division, which
today includes several hundred power
plant engineers.
In January, 1953 Mr. Landis was pro-
moted to the position of vice president of
his company, and his work now includes
business development.
He is an active participant in a study
team known as the Nuclear Power Group.
Composed of engineers from several of
the nation's public utilities, this organiza-
tion has been preparing, under an agree-
ment with the Atomic Energy Commis-
sion, both economic and design studies
for a power plant which could be built in
the immediate future, using established
reactor principles.
Recently he was elevated to the rank of
Fellow in The American Society of Me-
chanical Engineers.
Mr. Landis has written many technical
papers connected with different phases of
his professional activities. He is a mem-
ber of the Pacific Coast Electrical Asso-
ciation, Atomic Industrial Forum, Inc.,
Electric Club of San Francisco, and the
Newcomen Society of England.
He resides in San Mateo, California.

TAKE YOUR CHOICE
THE GOSPEL
Verily, I say unto you, marry not an
engineer, for the engineer is a strange
being, possessed of many devils; yea,
he spealceth eternally in parables which
he calleth "formulas," and he hath but
one Bible, a handbook.
He talketh always of stresses and
strains, and without end of therbo-
dynamics. He showeth always a serious
aspect and seemeth not to know how to
smile; and he picketh his seat in the car
by the springs therein and not by the
damsel beside him; neither does he know
a waterfall save for its power, nor the
sunset except for her absorption spec-
trum.
Always he carrieth his slide rule with
him and he entertaineth his maiden with
steam tables. Verily, though his damsel
expecteh chocolates, when he calleth he
brings samples of iron.
Yea, he holdeth his damsel's hand,
but only to measure the heat content
thereof, and kisses but to test the vis-
cosity. In his eyes shineth a far-away
look which is neither love nor longing—
but a vain attempt to recall a formula.
There is but one key to his heart, and
that is the Sigma Tau Key; and one love
letter for which he yearneth and that
an "A"; and when to his damsel he
writeth of love and signeth with crosses,
take not these symbols for kisses but
rather for unknown quantities.
Even as a youth, he pulleth a girls
hair to test its elasticity, but as a man he
discovered different devices; for he would
count the vibrations of her heartstrings
and reckons her strength of materials; for
he seeketh ever to pursue his passion in
a formula; and his marriage is an equa-
tion involving two unknowns and yield-
ing diverse answers.

YOU LUCKY GIRLS
Engineers are the best marriage pros-
pects, will make the best husbands, says
Dr. James Bender, director of the Na-
tional Institute for Human Relations.
"They have the best hearts for marriage"
is the way he puts it. But, he warns,
they are shy, and the girl who wants to
catch her engineer will have to be some-
what aggressive.
Dr. Bender goes on to enumerate the
sterling qualities of the typical engineer
who, according to his summation, appears
to be the ideal mate, indeed. One won-
ders whether there is much hope for the
girl who marries a mere doctor, lawyer,
or public accountant. Engineers, it seems,
are the least neurotic of all vocational
groups and rarely quarrel. They are
"tender lovers" and good parents who
like large families. They are religious and
good church goers. They are homebodies
and like to putter around the house. They
apply logic to morals, economics, science,
and job loyalty. And while they are a bit
shy, they are one-woman men who don't
get involved with their secretaries.
The lucky, lucky girl who gets an engi-
neer might as well know what a paragon
he is, according to the scientific analysis
undertaken by the institute. It seems
probable that there will be quite a run
on the available supply of engineers as
Dr. Bender's report gains circulation. The
engineers themselves will take pardonable
pride in the results of this survey, preen
themselves a little in the limelight, un-
aware until now, probably, just what nn&gt;;
fellows they really are.
And then there was the rather forlorn
engineer who, on seeing a pigeon flying
directly overhead, exclaimed "Go ahead,
everyone else does!"
Dear Ruth:
I just read in the paper that students
who don't smoke make much higher

I would rather make a B and have the
enjoyment of smoking; in fact I would
rather smoke and drink and have a G
Furthermore, I would rather smoke,
drink and neck and make a D.

Dear Ruth:

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


The basic function of industrial engineering is to develop and control methods for reducing manufacturing
costs by effecting the best possible utilization of men, materials and equipment. The industrial engineer is
trained to use constructive thinking to plan good methods, layouts, factory budgets, and standard proce-
dures so as to minimize costs. He is likewise trained to be analytical in studying facts relating to manufactur-
ing problems and in determining improved courses of action.
The above photograph shows students using a 16 mm. moving picture film in one of the University's labor-
atories to analyze a factory job and determine ways of improving it. An extensive film library of industrial oper-
ations is available for this purpose. Other sections of this laboratory are used in determining output standards
by means of time study and the times for basic motions. Modern machine tool and gage laboratories are avail-
able to aid in studying the development and control of such processes as machining, welding, forging, cast-
ing, die-casting, rolling, and stamping.
The Industrial Engineering curriculum includes the same basic technical background developed by all
curriculums in the College of Engineering. In addition, specialized training is offered in one of two options,
or branches, of this curriculum, the Management Option "A" or the Production Option "B". Courses in the
Management Option deal with production control, statistical quality control, wage incentives, engineering
economy, materials handling, plant layout and industrial relations. The Production Option offers some of
these courses and others concerned more specifically with the development of manufacturing processes. Study
can be made leading to the Bachelor of Science, Master's, and Doctor's Degrees.

A PROGRAM FOR HIGHER EDUCATION?
Dr. Edwin S. Burdell, president of the Cooper Union
in New York City, delivered a speech recently which at-
tracted a good deal of attention and favorable comment.
His thesis was that preparation for the great influx
of college students in the 1960's should not proceed in
terms of University expansion primarily, but in a new
type of school with a terminal program that will prepare
students for business, industrial, and agricultural vocations
for which they are fitted. Dr. Burdell's plan, he says, is not
"intellectual snobbery" but a realistic approach to the prob-
lem of giving students the kind of education for which
they are best fitted and which the community can afford.
"If this scheme found acceptance, there would be left
to the University only those students who would be
working toward master's and doctor's degrees. The much
abused and devalued bachelor's degree might even disap-
pear," says Dr. Burdell.
This program is a beautiful piece of simple, systematic
thinking introduced in an area which has been saturated
for the last ten years with educators and legislators opinion-
ating incessantly and getting very little done. It is logical
program and one that should gain increasing support. I can
see only one fault in it; I don't think it would ever work.
In the first place, separating the wheat from the chaff is
easier said than done and Dr. Burdell's program collapses
if this cannot be accomplished. Any University Admissions
director can tell you that high school grades have practi-
cally no correlation with the grades a student gets at the
University. Furthermore, any admissions test based on
factual knowledge would necessarily be biased in favor
of students from the large, well-equipped, big-city schools.
An aptitude test will indicate a person's potential for aca-
demic success but no psychologist would use it to predict
success. Interviews are helpful but extremely time-consum-
ing and inefficient. In short, there is no simple, practical
method of determining beforehand whether a student is
able to obtain a college degree. If all the tests mentioned
above were combined and administered, perhaps some pre-
diction could be made, but such an expensive program
would be impossible to maintain for the large volume of
new students anticipated.
Besides, arbitrarily separating the scholars from the dolts
would take away the God-given, good-old-American right
of any idiot with enough money to get himself flunked
out of any college he can get into. Many a successful busi-
ness executive when asked the turning point in his career,
will choose the time when he was flunked out of college.
Instead of being handed a slip of paper after 2 years at one
of Dr. Burdell's colleges of mediocracy and told that he
was now equipped to enter the business world, our man
had to face up to the fact that there were a hell of a lot of
people smarter than he was and that he was going to haw
to work awfully hard to beat them to the money.
This, of course, is an exaggerated example, but it does
point out one of those intangible values of a college edu-
cation, learning the calibre of the opposition, that would
be difficult to obtain at one of Dr. Burdell's institutions.
It is, unfortunately, much easier to criticise a scheme
than construct one and I have, perhaps, extended my critical
privileges to the limit. I think Dr. Burdell is right in de-
ploring the indiscriminate expansion of our universities;
I think we will all agree that some serious planning must
be done if we are to avoid mediocracy. We can look
around us and readily imagine the chaos that would result
if the University of Michigan expanded 30% in five years
to meet the coming flood. What can be done?
If we are not to deny anyone mentally and financially
capable the privilege of a college education, then we must
begin to make maximum use of the facilities presently
available and the facilities that can be made available
through a limited expansion. For example, the College of
Engineering presently has agreements with eight small
liberal arts colleges under which a student who has spent
three years at one of these institutions may, after two ad-
ditional years at the University, be granted an engineering
degree. A marked expansion of this program would not
only be of great benefit to the many small, good liberal
arts colleges (who are always notoriously under-enrolled),
but would allow the University to concentrate on educating
students of proven capabilities rather than educating and
weeding out simultaneously.
This is only one possibility of expansion without de-
terioration; undoubtedly, an experienced college administra-
tor could find others.
The point is this: no single, Utopian scheme, no matter
how beautifully logical, will answer the need if univer-
sities, as we know them, are to suffer any radical change.
Judicious action, with the goals of the University clearly
in mind, is needed. University administrators have a sizable
task before them.

more opportunities for qualified engineers"
Since 1952, John F. Holt has been
Assistant Superintendent of the Coke
and Coal Chemicals Department at
United States Steel's new Fairless
Works in Morrisville, Pa. He started
working at U.S. Steel—as a trainee—in
1947. That's a lot of progress in just five
years. For in his present position, John
is responsible for both the quality and
the quantity of all coal chemicals pro-

3,500,000 gallons of light oils per year.
190 hourly employees and 25 super-
visory personnel report to him.
But John's case of rapid advance-
ment is not unusual. U.S. Steel has
always placed great emphasis upon its
management training programs and
has provided the kind of training that
enables ambitious young engineers to
take over responsible positions within a
comparatively short time.
As one example, John feels that the
opportunities in his own department
are very promising at this time. He
says, "Many important new concepts of

KEEP IT COOL!
Interest in air-conditioned homes,
offices, and factories has remained
at a high level since World War II,
but there remains a general foggi-
ness in the layman's mind as to just
what air-conditioning is and what it
should be doing. The following res-
ume should clarify things consid-
erably.
Reprinted with permission of Minnesota
Technolog.
Air conditioning is the science of con-
trolling the temperature, humidity, move-
ment, and purity of air. The reasons for
air conditioning are to maintain human
comfort and health, control atmospheric
conditions for industrial processes, and
attain air conditions suitable for storage
of goods. This article is concerned with
the physical and chemical conditions of
the air as they relate to human comfort
and health.
For many years, air was conditioned

planes waiting to take off and either

standing aircraft.
with the thought of maintaining its pur-
ity. Close control of temperature and hu-
midity was thought to be relatively unim-
portant. "Crowd poison" was the term
given to people breathing and giving off
odors to the air. Discomfort in a crowded
room was thought to be caused by ex-
cesses of carbon dioxide and other im-
purities in the air. Tests of the American
Society of Heating and Ventilating Engi-
neers, (ASHVE), have proved this old
idea to be false. Experiments showed that
conditions of both comfort and discom-
fort could be obtained with either high or
low concentrations of carbon dioxide by
varying temperature and humidity. Pres-
ent-day control of air impurities consists
of adding only enough fresh air to di-
lute the room air to a point where body
odors are not perceptible and smoke is
not objectionable. According to the Air
Conditioning Manufacturers' Association,
the minimum addition of outside air
should be five cubic feet per minute for
nonsmokers and twenty-five cubic feet per
minute for smokers.
Outside air introduced to a conditioned
space must have its movement controlled
to prevent adverse physiological and psy-
chological effects. A certain amount of air
movement over the body is necessary to
remove heat and moisture, but drafts
cause too rapid dissipation of body heat
and cooling of skin surfaces. With many
individuals the psychological factors per-
taining to air movement affect comfort. A
slight draft which could not cause too
rapid cooling could cause discomfort be-
cause of false ideas held by a person.
Some people like to have a window open
at all times irrespective of room air tem-
perature, humidity and purity. The Trane
Company has found that air velocities up
to forty feet per minute will not cause
complaint.

chemical energy in food to heat energy is
called metabolism. The body adjusts its
rate of metabolism to maintain an inter-
nal temperature of 98.6° F. A second
method of maintaining constant body
temperature is by varying the flow of
blood to the skin surfaces. An increase in
flow of blood increases the rate of heat
loss to the surrounding air. The third
method, usually coming into effect after
the other two, is increased body heat loss
through moisture evaporation on skin.
The system is able to adjust to different
climates by changing the rate of metabol-
ism. This adaption is called acclimatiza-
tion. Acclimatization may take two or
three months. The sweat glands are more
effective for handling widely varying heat
losses necessitated by changing activities
during the day. The expulsion of mois-
ture by the sweat glands is incidental to
the expulsion of heat thereby. The body
also has other means of disposing of
moisture. The heat losses of the body may
be classified as either latent or sensible.
Sensible heat losses take place through
conduction, convection, and radiation.
Losses by conduction are the least im-
portant, but deserve consideration in some
instances. A worker will occasion discom-
fort if forced to stand or sit on a cold
object having high conductivity. Convec-
tion losses are to the air which circulates
over the skin. The loss in heat varies di-
rectly with the rate of circulation. Main-
taining convection air currents in an oc-
cupied space is no problem on earth. Air
picking up body heat expands and the
more dense cold air is drawn to the bot-
tom of the room by gravity pull. In plan-
ning a trip into space in a rocket, a means
of providing convection would have to
be considered because a human's breath
would hang around him like a fog and
warm, moist air would envelop his body.
The sensible heat losses by radiation
are a function of the temperature differ-
ence between the body and the object re-
flecting or absorbing heat, the absorptive,
and the distance separating the body and
the object. Ordinarily the effect of radia-
tion to a cold object is imperceptible;
however, if a person stands by a pile of
cold steel in a warehouse, the effect is
noticeable. The affect of radiation from a
hot object is very apparent as in the case
of an electric heater or a pot of molten
metal. It is possible to maintain body
comfort with air temperatures lower than
normal if the walls of a room radiate
enough heat to the body to make up for
the increased heat loss to the colder air.
The latent heat loss of the body is the
heat given up to evaporate the moisture
expelled by the sweat glands. While sen-
sible heat accounts for most of the body
heat loss at low temperatures, latent heat
accounts for most of the loss at high tem-
peratures.
"Effective temperature (E.T.) is defin-
ed as that index which expresses the com-
posite effect of air temperature, relative

humidity, and air motion on the human
body." As implied by this definition, no
one factor determines comfort, but a com-
bination of factors. For a given dry bulb
temperature, varying degrees of comfort
may be obtained by varying humidity and
air motion. ASHVE tests show that for
any temperature within a range of 17 de-
grees for summer and 14 degrees for win-
ter, comfort conditions for most people
may be obtained by varying the relative
humidity. It is conceivable that if the
factor of air motion had been included in
the tests, that an even greater range of
temperature could have been obtained.
The ASHVE experiments showed that a
combination of high humidity and low
dry bulb temperature have the same effect
on comfort as high dry bulb temperatures
and low relative humidity. An effective
temperature of X degrees means that the
air in question will produce the same sen-
sation of warmth as saturated air at X
degrees dry bulb.
The first consideration in designing an
air conditioning system is sizing the
equipment to obtain the maximum amount
of air that would be required under ord-
inary conditions. Ordinary determinations
are made on the basis of so many cubic
feet of air per minute per individual in
the occupied space. Air quantity supply
specifications for industrial applications,
where toxic or explosive vapors are given
off, are usually given by city ordinance as
an air change per so many minutes.
The quality or purity of the air in the
conditioned space may be controlled by
varying the per cent recirculated or by
means of air wash or filters.
The air entering a conditioned space
should not be directed toward the occu-
pants. Flow should be planned to elimin-
ate any dead spaces in the room.
The velocity of the air across a room
should be kept under 40 feet per minute
for human comfort. The air entering
through ducts should not exceed 2000
feet per minute.
To condition air for comfort and
health, air temperature, humidity, motion,
and purity must be considered. Effective
temperature is a useful tool in combining
these factors.

What would happen to the human body in a
weightlessness, the brilliant light and heat of the sun
Mike Kentosh, USAF, tells of some studies that are
lation on space travel.
MAN ON THE THRESHOLD
OF SPACE
Ever since the first heavier-than-air
craft was launched a half-century ago,
man has been striving to fly higher and
faster in the ocean of air which surrounds
this planet. For possibly the last three-
decades it has been the dream of many
flight enthusiasts to fly so fast and so high
as to leave the Earth, with its familiar
atmosphere and gravity, and travel
through space to other worlds. Recently
this dream, along with the realization that
the first nation to fly successfully to the
moon would hold a tremendous military
advantage, has prompted governments to
engage in a race to conquer space.
Aside from the strictly technical prob-
lems of space flight, such as efficient fuels
and materials, there lies the extremely in-
teresting question as to whether or not the
human body could survive the rigors of
space travel. Man is accustomed to living
in a special environment: a special at-
mosphere composed of a certain concen-
tration of certain gases exerting a certain
pressure, all under the influence of a
fixed force of gravity, and at a rather
narrow range of temperature.
It is quite true that engineers cannot
do much about man's physical shortcom-
ings, but given time they will be able to
recreate his special environment on the
space vehicle, and later on the newly con-
quered planet. Even now, men are flying
aircraft at altitudes where the air is so
thin as to be comparable to flight in space
so far as respiration and pressure are con-
cerned. The Bell X-l and the Douglas
Skyrocket are two aircraft capable of such
flights. Maj. Arthur Murray, U.S.A.F.
has flown to a height of about 90,000
feet, and how many times this record has
been broken, if at all, is highly secret
military information.
Aircraft are being developed which will
fly yet higher, at speeds several times the
speed of sound. The main question mark
in the vast technological development is
man: just what is man*s speed limit, how
high can he fly, and how much can he
be depended upon under these unfamiliar
and often deadly conditions. "Our
planes," says North American's Chairman
Dutch Kendelberger, "are rapidly ap-
proaching a point where they are penal-
ized rather than aided by the presence
of a human pilot.
The Air Force is vitally interested in
finding the answers to the question of
man's adaptability to space travel. Accord-
ingly the Department of Space Medicine
has been established as part of the School
of Aviation Medicine, Randolph Air
Force Base, San Antonio, Texas. A former
German scientist, Dr. Hubertus Strug-
hold is head of this department.
This article is not concerned with the
theoretical possibilities of space travel.
True, a satisfactory fuel has not yet been
developed which can produce speeds nec-
essary to escape the Earth. But this prob-
lem, along with countless others atten-
dant on such an awe-inspiring project,
can be overcome with research and tech-
nological engineering. Even now, elec-
tronically controlled rockets and missiles
are being launched which attain terrific
speeds and heights, without, of course,
the limiting factor of a human passenger.
The WAC Corporal rocket has reached a
height of 43 miles, the V-2 rocket, 100
miles, the Viking, 130 miles, and a V2/
WAC Corporal two-step has soared 250
miles high into space. So the race is on,
and the sky's the limit.
MAN IN THE SPACE VEHICLE
High Speeds
The human passenger on a space
vehicle blasting off for the moon will
face many stresses and dangers not experi-
enced on the Earth in the protective blan-
ket of the atmosphere. The first of these
stresses will be felt at the very beginning
of the flight, during the time it takes the
vehicle to break loose from the influence
of gravity. It has been calculated that a
space vehicle would have to be travelling
at 25,000 miles per hour in order to
overcome the pull of gravity and escape
into space. To attain high speed with
present day rocket fuels, the ship must be
given a tremendous push at the start,
causing the craft to undergo high progres-
sive acceleration.
This "progressive acceleration shows
that a man in the cabin of the space
vehicle would undergo forces up to
10 times that of normal gravity," and
these forces would be prolonged over
several minutes. The Air Force has used
high-speed centrifuges and found that
5 g (5 times normal gravity) for four
minutes will not produce any ill effects
on the human body. It has also been de-
termined that the human body can best
tolerate these forces in a prone position,
on specially designed contour bunks,
wearing crash-type equipment. So per-
haps with better equipment and methods,
the 5 to 6 g. the body can now tolerate
can be increased to the formidable 10 g.
Some authorities believe that 10 g for
two minutes is not too much for the hu-
man body to take, but the real answer lies
in continued study. Also, the time may
come when new fuels and new power
plants, will enable space ships to build
up velocities more gradually, thereby
minimizing the strain on passengers and
equipment.
In addition to the stresses of extreme
acceleration, the human passenger will
have to endure other effects of high
speed. Rockets in flight tend to veer from
the longitudinal course. In fact they can
even tumble end over end, and in airless
space this would not lessen their speed.
But the passengers in a spinning or
tumbling space vehicle would suffer as no
sailor on a wavetossed ocean ever suffered.
These unnecessary tumbling and spinning
movements must be controlled by mechan-
ical means, but the controlling devices
will add considerable weight and compli-
cation to the space ship.
Then there is the problem of turning
or guiding the rocket in space flight. A
turn of 2 degrees, which could not be de-
tected on Earth in an automobile, would
impose a stress of 20 g on the occupants
of a space ship traveling at a high veloc-
ity. However, if such a force is felt for
a brief interval and the passengers are
properly braced, it is not so formidable.

Sustained acceleration is the kind that
gives trouble.
Weightlessness
When the space vehicle succeeds in
overcoming the pull of gravity, a bizarre
condition, called zero gravity, will exist.
At zero gravity all objects, man included,
become weightless and float about aim-
lessly. Man may find this experience to
be the most horrifying as well as the most
troublesome aspect of space travel. At
zero gravity a human body loses its orien-
tation and has the impression of being in
a free fall. The physiological effects of
this experience may be violent enough
(nausea, increase in pulse rate, etc) but
the psychological effects may be far more
serious. The fear of falling is one of the
fundamental fears, and to be subjected
to this fear day and night, during all ac-
tivities, may be too much for the human
body's delicately balanced nervous system,
which has been developed to react in rela-
tion to a constant pull of gravity on its
various members. On the other hand it
may be that the mind will quickly adjust
itself to this sensation.
If man could overcome this basic-
fear, life in a space vehicle at zero
gravity would still be very complicated,
for orientation would be by vision
alone. A man would have to look at his
arm to determine where it was. Any slight
movement, such as writing, would send
the space passenger bounding across the
compartment. Eating, drinking, and elim-
ination of waste could be accomplished
without trouble because these functions
do not depend upon gravity. However,
only certain foods (sandwiches, fruits,
bulk vegetables, etc.) could be eaten and
all liquids would have to be drunk out of
plastic squeeze bottles. A man needs two
pounds of bulk food per day, as the meal-
in-a-pill idea is not any more feasible on
a space ship than on Earth, and special
utensiles would be necessary to aid in con-
suming this quantity of food under
weightless conditions.
Aside from the terrors and the incon-
venience of zero gravity, certain physio-
logical problems may make this condition
dangerous to the space passenger. The
heart and other organs have been accli-
mated to a certain orientation in the body
and a constant pull of gravity. The heart
might conceivably race out of control,
pumping blood with no weight. Space
doctors doubt this on the basis of the
brief experiments with weightlessness so
far, but they can't be sure about this until
reliable laboratory tests can be made.
A space traveller faces yet another
problem due to zero gravity. This is the
dangerous weakening of the voluntary
muscles. Exercise by springs or elastic
bands would be feasible, though weight-
lifting, walking, or even calisthenics
would be useless.
Zero gravity would probably be the
most serious test of the human body's
psychological adaptability to space travel.
The condition is thought to be physically
harmless. In early 1951, white mice were
rocketed forty miles high and their be-
havior was photographed while they were
in the free fall. The mice behaved
normally throughout the flight and did
not lose their coordination. Today's jet
pilot occasionally experiences weightless-
ness when, in certain arcs of flight
centrifugal force equals the force of
gravity. At this point everything loose
in the cockpit floats aimlessly about. The
pilot has a tendency to become disoriented
and confused. Fifteen or twenty seconds
of this bizarre condition are as long as
pilots have been able to maintain it up
to now, and their reports on the effects
vary.
Several solutions for the problem of
weightlessness have been advanced. Mag-
netic shoes, or the magnetized metal
cloth coverall advocated by some writ-
ers could be useful on a space vehicle.
The most obvious solution, however,
seems to be to create an artificial gravity
aboard the vehicle. Many authorities
feel that the ship should be rotated
in flight in order to assist stability and
create an artificial gravity. A speed of
rotation of one revolution in three seconds
would be sufficient to make the centrifugal
force thus created equal to the pull of
gravity on Earth. "Down" would be to-
wards the circumference of the ship, or
outside wall, and "up" would be towards
the center or axis of the vehicle.
The Artificial Atmosphere
The human body is accustomed to ex-
istence at the bottom of an ocean of air.
The vital substance in this ocean, as in
the sea, is oxygen, without which no liv-
ing creature can survive. One-fifth of the
atmosphere at nearly all levels is oxygen.
But the great bulk of the atmosphere—
approximately half of it—is concentrated
by its own weight below 18,000 feet.
Long before a flyer reaches this height, or
at about 12,000 feet, he begins to suffer
from increasing lack of oxygen.
High-altitude aircraft are equipped
with pressurized cabins or cockpits, arti-

by ROBERT REDMOND, '55 I.E.
By the time this magazine hits the newstands, the
UAW-CIO will have made the Guaranteed Annual
Wage a national issue. An understanding of the is-
sues at stake, as outlined by Bob Redmond in the
article below, is certainly necessary if we 1 are to
appreciate the effect GAW might have politically
and economically.
In a sense I feel somewhat like the
pregnant woman who is but one month
away from delivery: It's too late to change
my mind. I say this because having been
commissioned to pose some of the various
issues involved with the G.A.W., I'm be-
ginning to realize that of all the literature
written about the G.A.W., none has been
forthcoming from the automobile indus-
try itself. Thus we are in a situation where
to a certain extent we are forced to ex-
amine the issues with material supplied
from (1) The UAW-CIO or (2) outside
interested parties such as professors, econ-
amists and industrial relations experts. As
such we can only guess at the feeling thu
management has for the G.A.W. No one
really knows whether they will mobilize
for an all out fight against such a pro-
posal or accept it with some modifications.
So please bear in mind that what follows
is an attempt to define the G.A.W. and
its concomitant difficulties without know-
ing what management's attitude really is.
The reader has probably noticed that
much publicity has been given to the
G.A.W. this past year. So I will define
generally some of the collective tactics
which take place before the actual bar-
gaining sessions begin.
During a period subsequent to actual
bargaining much publicity is forthcom-
ing about issues which will be discussed
at the bargaining tables. In many cases
both sides i.e., Management and labor
make known their views. If a completely
new and rather revolutionary concept of
industrial relations is to be decided upon
during bargaining sessions, we usually
find that a definite attempt is made to
influence the public either to accept or
reject the proposal. Usually such a pro-
posal is a turning point case i.e., when
once accepted by one large corporation it
will inevitably be accepted by the industry
as a whole, We arc now and have been
for some time in the dressing up period
with respect to the G.A.W. Much has
been said since World War II about the
feasibility of instituting such a program
in the automobile industry. Lest there be
some feeling that the UAW-CIO is not
too serious about the G.A.W. let me say
at this point that such is not the case.
They will do anything within their power
to see to it that the plan becomes the
basis for any new wage contract nego-
tiated with the "big three" this year. The
present contracts at Ford and General Mo-
tors expire in May and Chrysler's contract
expires in August.
The term Guaranteed Annual Wage is
in one respect somewhat of a misnomer.
The UAW-CIO is not demanding a
guaranteed pay as much as they are a
guaranteed annual employment plan. The
whole purpose of the plan is to force
management to regularize employment as
much as is within the realm of possibility.
The union's contention is and has been
for some time that many layoffs result
from poor planning on the part of man-
agement and if they are forced to pay for
layoffs they will seek a means to eliminate
them.
What follows is a general outline of
the G.A.W. as proposed by the CIO-
UAW.
I THE GUARANTEE
A Guarantee
(1) All workers able to work and
available for work will be guaranteed
forty straight time hours ol work or pay
at their regular wage rates for every week,
unless notified in advance that they are to
be laid off for the entire week. The pay
guarantee for pieceworkers will be forty
times their previous average straight time-
hourly earnings if given less than forty
straight time hours of work during any
week or not notified in advance of a full-
week layoff.
(2) When such advance notice is
given, seniority workers will receive guar-
antee payments for each full week of lay-
off in amounts sufficient to enable them ro
maintain the same living standards as
when fully employed.
B Coverage
(1) All workers will be covered by
the forty hour guarantee.
(2) All workers who have seniority
status, including those who acquire sen-
iority after the plan becomes effective,
will be covered by the guarantee against
full-week layoffs.
C Duration of Guarantee Payments
(1) The forty hour guarantee will be
effective for every week in which the
worker is called in, or for which no prior
notice of full week lay-off has been given.
(2) The guarantee against full week
layoffs will be effective for up to fifty-
two consecutive weeks of such layoff.
(3) The duration of guarantee pay-
ments for full week layoffs for an indi-
vidual worker will be a ratio of the total
of the number of weeks from the date he
acquired seniority to the effective date of
the plan, plus the number of weeks for
which he received compensation (except
guarantee payments for full week layoffs)
after the plan becomes effective.
Duration for a worker who acquires
seniority after the plan becomes effective-
will be based on the number of weeks
for which he receives such compensation
after he acquires seniority.
(4) When a worker is recalled after
a layoff, he will be entitled when next
laid off to the unused balance of guar-
antee weeks at the time of recall, plus a
ratio of the number of weeks for which

Tiny flecked the sweat off his brow,
spat, and walked over to the pile of cylin-

shoulder, then walked to the edge of the
truck. Christ—but he hated to jump
down. Of all the things to be done—he
hated to jump down.
All the world loves a fat man—some-

Tiny still had to cope with gravity.
He leaned forward, hesitated—
"Hell with it." The black tank went
spinning out from the platform, landing
with a dull thud. A red bandana flashed
out of his pocket—he cleared imaginary
particles from his nose, turning in a circle.
The hot desert sun beat down on him,
little trickles of liquid ran down his back
and tickled him, blinding glare greeted
him from the desert floor.
"Christ."
He looked about him. "Desert. Desert
and a road. Concrete and a rocket and
desert. Desert and a road.-—Christ."
Tiny groaned as he hit the ground, his
stiff legs jarring him, his inwards bounc-
ing up and down and hurting. He should-
ered the black cylinder, moving his hands
quickly from the burning half, and head-
ed for the control center.
"And he opens d' door, and he comes
in. and he steps on d' scales, and it's
tree hunnerd and forty pounds—d fat
man—an where the hell you goin' with
that tank?"
"Yeh Tiny—where you heading with
that gas?"
"Griffin wants it."
"What for,"
"For the DOG—"
"What's he screwin' up now?"
Tiny inhaled deeply. "He isn't 'screwin
up' anything—he found a unit loose in it
and he's going to tamp it down—thinks
it might be where we ran into trouble
last time. Don't worry Link, Griffin
knows what he's doing."
"That's what we're afraid of."
Tiny left Socrates and Link behind
him, eased his bulk thru the narrow
aisles and slid the tank down in front of
Griffin.
"Hi Tiny. Nice day—isn't it?"
"Yeah." Tiny snorted a chuckle. He
watched Griffin's fingers work—hook up
the acetylene and oxygen—pull out the
cutting torch, and don goggles.
"Say?"
"Yes Tiny?"
"What y' cuttin' for Griff? Thought
you just wanted to weld."
"Ah!—this whole unit is cockeyed—
it's in on an angle—I'm going to cut it
loose and straighten it up."
"What difference does the angle

maybe a whole lot."

"Like putting a stress on the junction
of these three adjoining units—You know
how this thing vibrates Tiny—the Dog
could be shorting itself inside out right

wasn't any shorts, Griff."

them down past his nose and under his

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


by DR. WILLIAM LILLER
In the few years since the completion
of the 200-inch reflector on Palomar
Mountain in California several notable
discoveries have been made, emphasizing
the value and importance of this huge
instrument. One of these discoveries was
the realization that our distance scale to
the other galaxies was off by a factor of
two, a fact that really didn't surprise
astronomers too much. The first hint of
such a correction came when it was found
that one particular species of star, one
that is valuable as an astronomical yard-
stick, failed to show up on photographs
of the nearest galaxies taken with the
200-inch. As a result, astronomers were
left with only one conclusion: the ga-
laxies are not as near as they were prev-
iously thought to be.
This same telescope has been able to
peer farther into the depths of space
than any other instrument, and yet there
is still no indication of whether there is
an end to our universe. In recent months
a galaxy has been photographed that is
rushing away from us at the tremendous
velocity of one-fifth the speed of light—
or at least it appears to be rushing away
from us at that speed. Obviously astron-
omers will have plenty to keep them-
selves occupied in the future trying to in-
terpret the observations of this mighty
telescope.
These are days when electronics take
an important place in our lives. Astron-
omers, too, are putting electrons to work
in numerous ways. Within the last twenty
years a new branch of astronomy has
opened up—radio astronomy. With high-
ly sensitive receivers radio radiation from
such familiar objects as the sun and the
Milky Way is being studied in the hopes
of finding new information about these
objects. Radio telescopes have come across
a large number of radio "stars," point
sources of radio noise in the sky which
one by one are being identified with ob-
jects which can be seen in ordinary visible
light. Many of these radio hot spots,
hardly visible on photographs taken with
the 200-inch telescope, often appear as
nothing more than a few wisps of inter-
stellar gas or perhaps a pair of distant
galaxies. But these inconspicuous mem-
bers of our universe are often found to
be in violent motion or in the process of
a colossal head-on collision and for a
reason not yet fully understood by astron-
omers are broadcasting tremendous
amounts of radio static into space.
Astronomers now know that although
there are no more than a couple of hydro-
gen atoms in every cubic inch of space
between the hundred billion stars in our
galaxy, the hugeness and transparency of
this space makes it possible to detect faint
radio signals from this interstellar gas.
Most of the gas is concentrated in the
arms of the huge stellar pinwheel of a
galaxy in which we live, and therefore
radio astonomy provides the astonomer
with a way of locating precisely the spiral
arms. Some of this mapping of our own
galaxy had already been done a few years
ago in another way. Fortunately the
brightest stars in the spiral arms are
among the hottest stars that we know of.
Because of their high temperatures, the
thin cloud of hydrogen that permeates
all of the space in these arms becomes
faintly luminous in the vicinity of these
stars. Therefore, if the proper cameras
are used, these signal haloes are easily
located and their central stars identified.
Knowing how luminous these super
bright giant stars really are and how
bright they look to be, the astronomer
can quickly calculate their distances.
A new precision in the measurement
of the brightness of celestial objects is
now being achieved through the use of,
again, electronics. The photoelectric cell,
producing an electric current under the
action of light, allows the astronomer to
determine the intensity of a star, for in-
stance, with as much accuracy as atmo-
spheric twinkling permits. Recent im-
provements in photoelectric techniques
have made it possible to measure starlight
too faint to be recorded photographically.
Astronomers are hoping that in the near
future the more efficient photoelectric
effect can be combined with the advant-
ages of photography through television
techniques. The pioneering work in this
field is underway at the present time, and
perhaps some day the effective apertures
of existing telescopes can be increased
many times through electronics. Already
the long exposure times needed to photo-
graph faint, distinct clouds of stars can
be divided by five. Image tube photo-
graphs of Mars made with the 200-inch
telescope last summer show much prom-
ise for this new technique. The very short
exposures which could be used came
closer to completely stopping the detail
on the planet's surface put into motion
by the shimmering atmosphere.
Better photographs of Mars would be
of more than usual interest these days.
Early this summer Dr. Dean B. McLaugh-
lin of the Astronomy Department here at
the University of Michigan suggested that
the dark greenish markings on Mars'
surface are not areas covered with vege-
tation of a low form as many astronomers
believed. Instead, he pointed out that
there would be gentle trade winds on
Mars, since it possesses a thin atmos-
phere. A few volcanoes, identical to those
on the earth and placed at the proper
points on the Martian surface, would
spew out ash which would be blown over
rather large areas. Dr. McLaughlin notes
that there are a number of dark markings
which come to an unusually sharp point
on the "windward" side. In many cases
drift patterns, following the prevailing
winds, can be traced out across the desert
regions. Because of the lack of oxygen in
the atmosphere of Mars, volcanic ash
would have a decidedly greenish hue. In
this way Dr. McLaughlin has explained
very neatly the "canals," which have gone
unexplained for so long. However, this
new theory has to be subjected to the
prying eyes of the new light detectors.
Late in the summer of 1956 Mars will
again come close to the earth and will be
under careful observation by many of the
large observatories. Perhaps by then even
further advancements in electronics will
supply observatories of the world with
better instruments.

TO HIGHER HORSEPOWER
by KEITH RYAN, '57 C.E.
Horsepower is an important factor in
winning auto races. If two cars of the
same size, weight, and maneuverability
have different power ratings, the car with
the higher power rating will be faster and
more likely to win. However, race spon-
sors generally try to place some limit on
the power of the cars in order to promote
competition. This limit is usually a re-
striction on the amount of displacement
engine for a mass-produced transportation
car. Therefore, the more radical, highly-
stressed engines with which this paper
will deal will find application more read-
ily in the racing than in the passenger car
field. However, racing developments have
a way of fostering improvements in pas-
senger car engines, and it is not unlikely
that the passenger car engine of the future
might provide more horsepower per dis-
where I.H.P.(n) (Indicated Horse-Pow-
er) is the horsepower of the engine dis-
regarding friction losses, (M.E.P.)
(Mean Effective Pressure) is the pres-
sure of the exploding fuel-air mixture in
the cylinder, "1" is the length of the
stroke, "a" is the area of a piston, and
"n" is the number of explosions per min-
ute.2 From this expression it may be seen
that increasing one or more of the four

of the cylinders; and since horsepower is
directly dependent on displacement,1 most
racers of the same displacement have ap-
proximately the same horsepower.
From the viewpoint of an automotive
engineer this restriction is a great oppor-
tunity, an opportunity to attempt to de-
sign an engine which will fall within the
displacement limits of a certain racing
class and yet produce more horsepower
than others of the same class. The engi-
neer-designer of a racing engine has not
only great incentive to try radical ideas to
increase the horsepower per displacement
ratio, but also has far more freedom of
experimentation than the designer of an
placement by the methods which might be
applied to today's racing engines.
The engineer's approach to the problem
of how to produce high horsepower with
limited displacement is to consider the
individual factors which determine horse-
power and attempt to modify the design
to effect a change in one or more of the
individual factors which will raise the
horsepower. Carpenter, in his Internal
Combustion Engines, Their Theory, Con-
struction, and Operation, gives the follow-
ing formula:
(M.E.P.) Ian
I.H.P.n = =
33000
factors, (M.E.P.), "1", "a", or "n", in-
creases the I.H.P. Each of these factors
must be considered, not only in its rela-
tion to the I.H.P., but in its relation to the
other factors as well.
The M.E.P. (the pressure the burning
gases exert inside the cylinder) is in itself
dependent on a number of factors. The
M.E.P. varies greatly with different fuels,
fuel-air mixture ratios, and combustion
chamber designs. In this work all engines
will be considered as running on the
same fuel, with the fuel-air mixture ratio
at that constant value which is best for
the particular fuel; and all the engines

like radar bombing systems, anti-aircraft fire con-
trol systems, and the Nike guided missile control

Western Electric is called upon to make these
things because of its vast experience with highly

"Yes, I know Tiny. Somebody gets
blamed for it."
"The boys are getting edgy Griff. I
think they're ready to start blaming some-
body."
"Somebody? Look Tiny. You know
damn well I wouldn't tamper with this
thing. It's like playing with dynamite.
I'm liable to touch the right two cables
and blow a door down to Satan. I'm a

"Pressure is getting us I guess. And the

we could boot him out of here."

Outside was the desert. The sun, the
sand, and the heat. And outside stood the
Bumble Bee, tall, slender, and beautiful.
And inside its slendering tip nestled a
million tons of death.
The first intensive work on long range,
ground to ground missiles had been start-
ed several years ago, early in the Cold
War. Out on the islands it began—tiny
spots in the Pacific which served both as
launching points and targets. There was
the day that the Spirit of Peace hurtled
750 miles and delivered an A-Bomb in
the midst of a mothball fleet. And then
came the feat of the Spirit of Freedom—
a rockfast island was blown to powder
by an H-weapon, launched 700 miles
away.
Then, with the lightning coups pulled
(Continued from page 17)
off in Europe by the Communists, and the
treachery in Yugoslavia, the Western Fac-
tion deemed it expedient that this work
be pushed.
And pushed it was. Ranges increased
to 1000 miles, 1500 and on, until the re-
searchers ran out of room. A big and
hasty decision was made by the Western
Faction, and the proceedings were moved
to the American Desert. There the LIB-
ERATOR went 3500 miles with a
dummy war-head and pin-pointed its tar-
get. Next would be a live missile, but
first a problem in control had to be dealt
with. Certain rational members of the
W. F. felt it would not be safe for a
live missile to be wandering over a friend-
ly country. It might blow a fuse or some-
thing. Further, the whole control system
was becoming inadequate in face of the
long ranges. The problem was turned
over to the engineers.
They came up with the DOG. Some re-
ferred to it as the BITCH but its Chris-
tian name was DOG. Others affectionately
held that DOG stood for Damned OY
Gadget—others held that it had a mind of
its own.
The DOG, which controlled the flight
of the rocket, thru a series of relay sta-
tions, until it was over the Pacific, where
the warhead was triggered and flight con-
trol turned over to the rocket, was a beau-
tifully fantastic combination of metal,
cable, relays, magnetic fields, transistors,
and multicolored lights. Nobody indi-
vidually seemed to know how the DOG
worked, but collectively they know, and
collectively they would pamper it and
punch its buttons, and send rockets
whistling West to the Pacific.
But somewhere something went wrong.
A new class of rocket had been de-
veloped, a long, slendering rocket that
would go far and fast and carry any
weapon man had, either in hand or on
the board. The first few were successful,
and the type was then put into produc-
tion.
The next one landed on the head of a
farmer sitting in an outhouse reading the
Sunday funnies. Some sadist made the
comment that it must have been a moving
experience.
The Wasp followed. For political rea-
sons, the W. F. felt an urgent need for a
show of power. The show didn't come.
Instead, to the U. N. building, where the
two sides of the world met, came the
news of an erratic flight and a crash in
Canada. The Bumble Bee was next. The
W. F. ordered that no time would be
wasted on investigation. The Bumble Bee
would go thru.
Ill
Inside the Main Control Room prepara-
tions were being made for the launching.
Socrates, the brilliant Southern boy, at-
tended to the launching mechanisms on
the DOG. "Security", a nervous little
man who didn't belong, walked around
checking everything, clicking open and
shut the snap on his fancy leather holster.
Link, scientist, engineer, in charge of the
small group in the M. C. R., a two ulcer
man, looked at Socrates and then at the
blue light above his head.
"Blue Light Socrates?"
"Yup. I'd be hollerin' plenty and run-
nin' awful fast if it wasn't."
Security jerked around. "Where's
Tiny?"
"Puttin' the truck in stow."
Security seemed irritated at the quick
answer. "Griffin driving for him now?"
"Don't frost your garter funny boy—
Griffin was out back doing some repair
on the DOG."
"WHAT?"
"You heard him." This from Link.
"I thought I gave orders that this thing
isn't to be touched by you guys. Not a
bolt! Hands off! Understand?"
"Yes daddy. "Socrates rolled his eyes
upward.
"Look—you guys don't seem to under-
stand my position. I'm responsible here.
If something does wrong I get pressured.
And confidentially, you guys know the
trouble I'm keeping you out of."
Link was mildly curious. "How so?"
"Investigations. Plain and simple.
There's been moves made to take you
Link, and you Socrates, and the whole
crew and make an investigation. Sabo-
tuers you know."
"And you saved us."
"My reports on you guys have been
favorable thus far—yes."
"Horse Manure."
Security tensed he snapped his hol-
ster shut.
Tiny flowed thru the door.
"It's fat man." Security was always
pleased at the prospect of Tiny.

More jobs—through science
From the earth, air, and water come new things for all of us—and new jobs
The elements of nature are a limitless frontier, a con-
tinuing challenge to science. Out of them, scientists are
developing new materials that benefit us all in many ways.
A CHEMICAL A MONTH-The scientists of Union
Carbide, for example, have introduced an average of
one new chemical per month for over twenty-five years.
Some of these have led to the growth of important
industries, such as plastics and man-made textiles. This,
in turn, has meant more opportunities, more jobs— in
construction, manufacturing, engineering and sales, as
well as in research.
IN OTHER FIELDS, TOO, the people of Union Carbide
have helped open new areas of benefit and opportunity.
Their alloy metals make possible stainless and other fine
steels; the oxygen they produce helps the sick and is
essential to the metalworker; their carbon products serve
the steelmakers and power your flashlight.
PROGRESS THROUGH RESEARCH-Union Carbide has
23 research and development laboratories constantly
working in major fields of science to continue this record
of product development—and more jobs through science.

ficially concentrating the air within them
by compression. Loss of cockpit pressure
at high altitudes by "explosive decom-
pression" suddenly exposes the passengers
to the thin air outside. At 45,000 feet the
amount of oxygen in the air is enough
to maintain useful consciousness for a
scant 30 seconds. Above 55,000 feet the
only oxygen available to the body is that
already in the blood and tissues, and it
lasts about 15 seconds. In space of course,
there is no free oxygen at all. The trav-
eler must take it with him.
The actual pressure exerted by the at-
mosphere also is vital to the human body.
At sea level this pressure is 14.7 pounds
per square inch. As it decreases above
19,000 feet, where the pressure is about
7 pounds per square inch, the flyer may
be subject to the "bends," especially under
explosive decompression. This painful
condition occurs when nitrogen from the
air vaporizes inside the points of the
body. Although it is not itself fatal, the
pain can cause a pilot to lose control of
his aircraft or even become unconscious,
leading to a crash.
At 50,000 feet the pressure of the at-
mosphere is so small—less than 3-5
pounds per square inch—that it equals
the pressure of waste gases in the lungs,
and the flyer can no longer inhale it. Even
below that altitude, he must resort to a
mask providing pure oxygen under pres-
sure. At 63,000 feet, where the air pres-
sure drops below 1 pound per square
inch, the blood and other body fluids will
boil. In space, naturally, there is no air
pressure whatever.
To overcome these effects of lowered
pressure, many pressurized suits have been
developed. The Air Force has a tight-fit-
ting union suit of strong cloth with a hel-
met that fits over the wearer's head. Inside
the suit and along the limbs are flat rub-
ber bladders with flexible tubes connecting
them to the high pressure oxygen which
the flyer breathes. This partial pressure
suit is useful in an emergency for about
ten minutes, but it is very uncomfortable,
as the hands and neck are not pressurized.
The Air Force has developed a true
space suit, but it, too, is uncomfortable
though safe, being completely airtight and
using compressed air to keep the wearer's
body at the proper pressure.

The Case of the Baffled Whirlpool
Some time ago, the report reached us that two
Worthington vertical turbine pumps installed by one
of our customers weren't working right. They deliv-
ered plenty of water, but vibrated badly and burned
out bearings.
The customer asked us to find the trouble fast.
After checking we knew the pumps were okay, so
Worthington Research had to answer him.
First thing we did was build a one-tenth scale
model of the customer's installation. The photo
shows what happened when we started pumping.
A whirlpool immediately formed between the water
surface and the pump inlet. Air, trapped in the whirl-
pool and carried into the pump, was the villain in
the case.
The solution came with experimentation. A simple
baffle arrangement in a side channel eliminated the
whirlpool—and the trouble-making air.
Chasing the gremlins from pump installations like
this, boosting the efficiency of heat transfer in air
conditioners, developing better seals for pumps and
compressors — these are all in the day's work for
Worthington's busy research engineers. At Worth-
ington, research ranks right alongside engineering,
production, and sales to develop better products for
all industry.

William J. Layne received his B.S. in Aeronautical Engineering from Purdue
University in 1950. Before joining the Allison engineering staff, he served
as a captain in the Air Force 1942-46 and 1951-53. Bill, now a Flight Test
Engineer, is shown taking gas turbine compressor readings from the equip-
ment used to start turbo-prop engines at the Allison Test Facility In
Indianapolis.
.AxLIS
JSON is out in front, leading all U. S. aircraft
engine manufacturers with more turbo-prop flight
experience than has been accumulated by all of the
nation's other engine manufacturers combined.
That's because Allison—working closely with the
military—was a pioneer in the design, development
and production of both engines and propellers for
turbo-prop aircraft. First flight with an Allison
turbo-prop engine was made in a Boeing B-17G at
Indianapolis in 1949. Today, eight different types
of military aircraft—including the VTO's—are mak-
ing history with the Allison Turbo-Prop.
The Allison Turbo-Liner, shown above, was
America's first turbine-powered, commercial-type
transport. This flying test bed, which is a Convair
240 converted to Allison Turbo-Prop engines and
Aeroproducts propellers, was the forerunner of
modern military transports such as the Lockheed
C-130 and the Convair YC-131C. After its first
flight in 1950, the Turbo-Liner was used primarily
as an engineering flight test aircraft, checking out
problems for military application. More recently,
the Turbo-Liner has been used on demonstration
flights to show the many advantages of a turbo-prop
powered transport. To date, the Turbo-Liner has
made nearly 700 flights and has accumulated nearly
500 hours of flight time.
Now available for commercial application, Alli-
son Turbo-Prop engines and their matching Aero-
products propellers today are setting new standards
for transport aircraft in speed, load-carrying ability,
and economical operations.
Looking ahead, with our extensive development
and expansion program, we need more engineers
to carry on in a field where you'll find unlimited
opportunity. We have immediate openings for the

A YEAR!
by HOWARD UROW, '58 E
Follow through E.R.I, project 2151 to see how a typi-
cal case, from the $8 million worth of sponsored
research, is handled.
Research, one of the three primary
aims of the University of Michigan to
gether with instruction and public service,
has been conducted for the past 35 yeais
through the Engineering Research In-
stitute. The institute has undertaken proj-
ects in the fields of Engineering and the
Physical Sciences as a result of problems
submitted to sponsored research by busi-
ness, industry, and the government. This
work is only conducted if it lends itself
to the research approach. Test work is
not conducted by the institute unless it is
a part of a complete program on a funda-
mental research problem.
Engineering research is a special type
of applied research. For the production
of a new and better product or the im-
provement of an old one, the engineer
often requires new information not previ-
ously published. As the design problems
become more and more complex, he must
depend on experimentation and creative-
ness. Unlike the scientist who seeks new
knowledge for the purpose of increasing
his general understanding of existing
phenomena but fails to carry this knowl-
edge beyond his laboratory in practice,
the engineer undertakes research for the
purpose of applying his discoveries and
added knowledge to creation of a product
which can be built repeatedly from com-
mercially available material for use and
which is capable of being maintained eco-
nomically. The research of today is writ-
ing tomorrow's handbooks with more in-
formation and a greater amount of ma-
terial from which the engineer can get the
answers to his many problems.
The work of the Engineering Research
Institute as an agency of the University,
has always been guided by the principles
of service: service to science, service to in-
dustry, service to the community, and ser-
vice to the university.
A service to science as well as to engi-
neering is performed by undertaking fun-
damental or basic research, the value of
which lies in its enrichment of our total

store of knowledge. Though carried on
without any thought of immediate appli-
cability to a specific field of scientific en-
deavor, this fundamental research may
later prove to have direct bearing on very
definite and practical problems. Some-
times the scientist himself envisions the
development possibilities of his findings,
or, on the other hand, scientific inquiry
of a fundamental nature may be an out-
growth of applied research. Frequently a
research project involves both types of
scientific endeavor.
A service to industry is carried out by
investigation into various fields related
directly to the manufacturing of some
product, improvement of some process,
analysis of production or plant operation
difficulties or to any specific industrial or
engineering problem. Many of the re-
search activities of the Institute have led
to improved methods of production, the
design of new devices, improvements on
old ones, and the fabrication of new and
better work materials. This type of re-
search begins either with the desire to
put to use certain results of fundamental
research or from a definite need intro-
duced to the Institute by industry. A bet-
ter product produced at less cost and in
less time is the end result of this research,
independent of the manner in which it
began. Of course, the public benefits from
this research as well as the manufacturer.
The author of the article about E.R.I,
in this month's issue, Howard Urow, has
been with the Technic staff since last
semester. He is a freshman planning to
get a degree in Industrial Engineering and
take up an industrial career in his home-
town, Chicago, after graduation. Besides
working for the Technic, Howard is
also on the Ensian sports staff, a member
of the ASTE, and a pledge of Alpha
Epsilon Pi.

improve the health, happiness, and well-
being of the individual and the family of
a community comprises a definite service
to the community. Much of this research
is sponsored by public utility companies
with projects submitted in quest of im-
provement on efficiency and reduction of
rates. Work done to improve our high-
ways and construct bridges, research con-
nected with the preservation of natural
resources, and studies concerned with our
shore lines and harbors have all con-
tributed to our welfare and happiness.
However, the work of the Institute
"should be viewed not only from the
standpoint of what it does for outside
interests but also from the standpoint of
what it does in the matter of stimulating
and assisting research and educational ac-
tivities within the University." A large
number of graduate students have been
aided in financing their studies and have
gained valuable experience in the proce-
dures and practices of scientific research
through work done as assistants on In-
stitute projects. The work done by mem-
bers of the faculty maintains their level of
knowledge to that of the latest develop-
ments in their respective fields and im-
proves the effectiveness of their teaching
activities. Fundamental research conduct-
ed by the engineer or the scientist widens
the scope of his knowledge with new in-
formation, while applied research ac-
quaints him with the problems confront-
ing industry and gives him an opportun-
ity to apply fundamental principles to
their solutions. Conscious of these bene-
fits to the faculty and students, the Engi-
neering Research Institute has always ex-
amined proposed research for the best in-
terest of the University's educational ac-
tivities.
The research at the Engineering Re-
search Institute is supervised and under-
taken by faculty men of considerable ex-
perience. The diversity of the faculty's
fields of interest is exceedingly important
in these days when there no longer exist
the boundaries which formerly were be-
lieved to confine the various sciences. In
fact, their interaction rather than their
self-sufficiency has become a dominant
concept, and, consequently, research meth-
ods once thought to be applicable to only
one field are used with equal success in
another. Engineering problems are not
necessarily undertaken by one depart-
ment alone. The research work on in-
dustrial problems is conducted under the
program best fitted to its needs which in
many cases involves cooperative work be-
tween separate engineering departments
Ex. research work on airplane combus-
tion would be undertaken jointly by mem-
bers of the faculty of both aeronautical
and mechanical engineering as well as
chemical engineering and chemistry. If
necessary the Institute brings in people
from the outside to work on a research
project.
The Institute's successful undertaking
of modern research work is dependent to
a great extent on the manifold facilities
of numerous up-to-date laboratories where
scientific and engineering investigations
may be carried on unhampered by produc-
tion demands. While much of the equip-
ment of these laboratories is standard re-
search equipment, some has been design-
ed and built by the University's own staffs
for specific application.
The University research worker has
the means for keeping abreast of recent
developments in his field and the litera-
ture pertinent to his specific problem if
he makes use of the extensive and well-
rounded collection of books and journals
in the several college and departmental
libraries on campus.
In practice the Institute makes even-
effort to supply the qualified men and the
necessary facilities for successful under-
taking of research projects. When it be-
came evident that sponsored studies in
some very specialized fields require full-
time supervisors and research workers,
the Institute engaged full-time non-faculty
personnel. With the increase in govern-
ment-sponsored research, facilities at the
Willow Run Research Center were made
available. Though much of the research
conducted by the Institute is for govern-
ment agencies, especially the armed ser-
vices, the growth of government spon-
sored projects is due in a very large meas-
ure to the increased sponsorship of funda-
mental and applied research. Industrially
sponsored research, however, has also in-
creased over the past years.
The usual method for setting up an in-
dustry-sponsored research project is for
University representatives to meet with
the sponsor to define the problem. When
this has been done, and when an effec-
tive and mutually agreeable program can
be developed, both cost and time can be
estimated with a fair degree of accur-
acy. These are made a part of the con-
tract so that the sponsor may know his
commitments in advance.
The program should fit into the Uni-
versity's policies and particularly into a
field in which the teaching department, in
whose laboratory the project is to be car-
ried out, has a special interest. A super-
visor, usually a member of the faculty, is
called upon to serve as project supervisor.
The cost of research depends upon the
scope and duration of the project. Cost
consists of actual charges for research and

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


ALUMINUM INDUSTRY
WAS BORN ON
SMALLMAN
STREET
V In 1888, the aluminum industry consisted of one company—
located in an unimpressive little building on the east side of
Pittsburgh. It was called The Pittsburgh Reduction Company.
The men of this company had real engineering abilities and
viewed the work to be done with an imagineering eye. But
they were much more than that. They were pioneers . . .
leaders . . . men of vision.
A lot has happened since 1888. The country ... the
company . . . and the industry have grown up. Ten new
territories have become states, for one thing. The total
industry now employs more than 1,000,000 people—
and the little outfit on Smallman Street? Well, it's a lot
bigger, too—and the name has been changed to Alcoa.
Aluminum Company of America . . . but it's still the
leader—still the place for engineering "firsts".
As you prepare to trade textbooks for a position in
industry, consider the advantages of joining a
dynamic company like Alcoa—for real job stability
and pleasant working conditions—where good
men move up fast through their association with
the recognized leaders in the aluminum industry.
We have fine positions for college graduate
engineers—in our plants, sales offices and
research laboratories from coast to coast.
These are positions of responsibility in
production supervision, plant and design
engineering, industrial research or sales
engineering. Right now it may be
quicker than you think from a seat in
the classroom to your career with
Alcoa. Why not find out?
Your Placement Director will be
glad to make an appointment for
you with our personnel represent-
ative. Or just send us an applica-
tion yourself. Aluminum

.a'JET IGNITION
THE tough job of lighting a match in a tornado will
give you some idea of the problem of firing a jet
engine on the ground. Even more difficult is refiring the
engine in flight should a flame-out occur—especially at
high altitude.
Up there you not only have to reckon with low-
volatility fuel but with rarefied air rushing through
your engine at super-hurricane speed. Here, you can be
certain, is a mixture that violently resists igniting!
Our Scintilla division at Sidney, N.Y., developed a
special ignition system with the answer: a super-spark
hot enough to fry a rock and of sufficient duration to
fire and refire jet engines quickly. It has worked so
successfully that, today, Bendix-Scintillat Jet Ignition
Systems have been selected as standard equipment by
most of the leading jet engine manufacturers.
Nation's Foremost Source
Bendix-Scintilla is known to engine people everyvA
as the nation's top source of supply for ignition eqs
ment. Most military planes rely on our ignition, and
doubt if you can ride on a commercial airliner that is
sparked by Bendix-Scintilla. Your power lawn mo«
farm or garden tractor or outboard motor may bl
one of our many types of magnetos developed for s
applications. Leading automotive manufacturers exp
menting with turbojet engines in passenger cars, tru
and buses are using Bendix-Scintilla Jet Ignition.
Continual research and years of practical field of
ation have fitted us to anticipate and solve ignit
problems; and that's why engine manufacturers, seek
advice, talk to Bendix-Scintilla people.

supervisory personnel, technical and non-
technical assistants, materials, use of
equipment plus a nominal overhead.
A contract is drawn up between the
sponsor and the Regents of the University
of Michigan, a constitutional corporation
under Article XI of the State Constitu-
tion. The significance of this being that
E.R.I, is separately incorporated which is
not the case with most university research
organizations.
The best way to illustrate how the in-
stitute operates and how a project is con-
ducted in practice is to describe one spe-
cific project—namely, E.R.I, project 2151.
The full name of this project is "Struc-
tural Behavior of the Reinforced Concrete
Stacks of the Clifty Creek Power Plant."
The sponsor was the American Gas and
Electric Service Corporation acting for the
Indiana-Kentucky Electric Corporation.
A previous project conducted by Pro-
fessor Sherlock of the Civil Engineering
department involved wind studies and
studies of gas velocities within the stacks
which governed the necessary height of
the stacks required to prevent air pollu-
tion. The result of this project was the
specifications of the largest stacks ever
constructed up to the present time—three
707 foot reinforced concrete stacks with
64 foot outside diameter at the base and
21 foot diameter at the top. Because of
their size, which extends beyond the range
of past experience, the sponsor desired an
independent check on the structural de-
sign.
Professor L. C. Maugh of the Civil
Engineering department was made proj-
ect supervisor. The following men work-
ed with him on this project: L. M. Legat-
ski, Associate Professor of Civil Engineer-
ing; Wadi S. Rumman, Instructor in Civil
Engineering; and Nelson Isada, graduate
student. Assisting these men were Bruce-
Johnston, Professor of Structural Engi-
neering; and Gunther Martin, special
adviser for the analogue computer opera-
tions.
The facilities and resources were pri-
marily the experience and training of
these men. However, the adaptation of
the analogue computer to the solution of
the fundamental dynamic problem was of
considerable assistance.
The work specified by the contract was
separated into two parts: (1) a study of
the proposed stacks to check their com-
pliance with standard practice and (2)
the investigation of structural problems
beyond the scope of the present specifica-
tions, particularly those problems asso-
ciated with the dynamic action of the
stacks when they are subjected to either
earthquake or wind forces. Special stress
and strain problems in the vicinity of the
gas-inlet opening were also included in
this phase of the work.
The work took about three months to
complete although certain phases of the
work were finished earlier. As the an-
swers to various problems were obtained,
the results were given to the sponsor in
personnel conferences.
The stacks are an essential part of the
new Madison, Indiana plant of the In-
diana-Kentucky Electric Corporation
which has signed a twenty-five year agree-
ment to furnish 1,200,000 kilowatts to
the Ohio Valley Electric Corporation and
the Atomic Energy Commission. Any
trouble to one stack would mean stopping
two generator units which is one third
the capacity of the plant. Herein lies the
significance of this project's investigations
into the stress and general structural
problems of the stacks.
The work of this project has been val-
uable to the University and the Civil Engi-
neering department by providing training
and experience in solving the dynamic
and special stress problems that are in-
herent in such large structures. Additional
experience in adopting the use of the
Civil Engineering department's analogue-
computer to the solution of special dy-
namic problems was gained. Through the
utilization of this instrument it was pos-
sible to predict the fundamental periods
of vibration and the normal modes of
vibration that govern the structural be-
havior when the stacks are subjected to
any dynamic action such as might be in-
duced by wind or earthquake action. This
phase of the work as well as the study ot
stress problems in the vicinity of the gas-
inlet opening involves special structural
problems that are not ordinarily encoun-
tered by the practicing engineer.
The results of the investigation and
work undertaken in this project deter-
mined centain requirements for which the
original design of the stacks was modified
to satisfy. Specifically the major modifica-
tion was an increase in the amount of
reinforcing steel used in the stacks. It is
felt that the additional safety with respect
to continued performance of this power
plant which will be in operation this
spring is a service to the industry and the
people of this country.

with a helmet coming down over the chest
is very uncomfortable and difficult to
walk or work in, when it is blown up
and the accordion-pointed limbs become
stiff and cumbersome. Dr. Fritz Haber,
formerly of the Department of Space
Medicine believes that humans landing on
a newly conquered planet will have to do
all space work in solid-walled cylinders,
provided with air conditioning units,
moving and working by remote control.
The journey through space will have
to be accomplished with the human pas-
sengers inside the space vehicle living in
a hermetically sealed cabin, which has
been pressurized with an artificial atmo-
sphere. A continuous flow of life-giving
oxygen will be pumped into the cabin
as the passengers consume it by respira-
tion.
The air in the cabin will be similar to
normal air, except that helium gas might
be substituted for the nitrogen gas which
normally constitutes about 78% of the
atmosphere. Neither gas serves any useful
purpose in normal breathing except to
dilute the oxygen and maintain the pres-
sure; but helium is one-fifth as soluble in
the blood as nitrogen. Under explosive
decompression, brought on by mechanical
failure or damage to the vehicle, the
bubbles of gas that produce bends would
not form in such quantities if helium
were used.
The toxic gases and fumes normally
present in the Earth's atmosphere as a re-
sult of respiration and combustion would
be a serious hazard in a confined atmo-
sphere, because they would gradually ac-
cumulate. Carbon dioxide could be re-
moved by alkalies, the method used in
submarines. However this method may
be too bulky, in which case peroxides
would serve to better purpose. Chemical
or physical means also could be used to
dispose of excess water. Smoking would
be prohibited because of the small quan-
tities of carbon monoxide it produces,
and cooking would have to exclude
broiling or frying, as fats decompose into
small quantities of acrolein, which is
very toxic.
A novel way to remove both carbon
dioxide and water from the atmosphere,
while adding oxygen to it, would be to
bring along living plants. They use car-
bon dioxide and water, and release oxy-
gen as a result of photosynthesis. One
square meter of pumpkin leaf will sup-
ply enough oxygen to support one man

directly by weight loss.
at rest. However, this method appears to
be much too bulky at present.
A unique problem becomes obvious
when we consider the air-conditioning of
a space vehicle. If the space ship is not
designed to furnish an artificial gravity,
the air in the cabin will be weightless.
Therefore, convection currents, caused by
the warming of air which becomes less
dense and rises, would not be present.
Every human in the cabin would be tight-
ly enveloped in a heavy layer of perspira-
tion vapors and exhaled breath. This con-
dition would be comparable to being en-
cased in an air-tight rubber suit. It would
be fatal if prolonged.
Hence, a forced-draft system must be
employed to circulate the air, in order to
purify the atmosphere. This adds to the
already formidable weight of equipment
required in the ship.
Temperature
The human body is comfortable in
temperatures between 60 and 83 de-
grees F, if the relative humidity is low.
A temperature well above or below this
range can be tolerated for short periods.
But man traveling through space will
have to be protected against wide ex-
tremes of temperature.
Aircraft engineers are familiar with
the problems caused by heat which is
generated when air particles bombard a
plane's skin at sonic speeds. To counter-
act this heat, the skins of high speed
experimental models are cooled by
apparatus equal to the cooling power
of thirty-five household refrigerators
However, at 2,500 miles per hour the
power required to cool the ship would
equal the ship's own power, and the heat
would be so great that many of todays
materials would melt or come apart. This
speed is called the thermal barrier.
The space vehicle will have to with-
stand the terrific heat of friction so long
as it is within the Earth's atmosphere,
and the answer lies in continued research
One solution would be to encase the nose
of the space ship in a ceramic carapace-
parabolic in shape, made of glass-like
aluminum oxide which can withstand
temperatures of 1500° C. The air particles
would strike this ceramic surface only,
and the heating would be confined to it
Outside the atmosphere, the carapace
would be jettisoned, before the heat had
time to penetrate into the interior. Bui
the problem of returning through the
atmosphere would still remain.

FORMULA FOR BETTER
FARMING
The petroleum industry seeks constantly
to extract the ultimate in valuable and useful
products from every barrel of crude oil. And
progress along this line in one area frequently
brings with it advances in other related areas.
For instance, improved catalytic reforming
methods developed by Standard Oil have
increased high octane gasoline yields. This
improvement is accompanied by substantial
increases in available by-product hydrogen,
which can be combined with nitrogen from the
air to produce ammonia. Standard has there-
fore completed plans to enter this important
chemical manufacturing field.
Anhydrous ammonia and nitrogen solutions
are increasingly favored by midwestern farmers
and fertilizer processors as sources of nitrogen.
This nitrogenous soil enrichment raises crop
yields and farm profits.
Young scientists and engineers enjoy work-
ing where such constructive projects are
constantly discussed, planned, and developed.

Once outside the atmosphere there is
no heat transfer from the air. The tem-
perature of an object in space is deter-
mined by the balance between the heat it
receives from the sun by radiation and
the heat which it radiates away. The space
vehicle would absorb heat on the side
turned to the sun, and radiate heat on the
other side. If the surface were dark-
colored, it would absorb much of the
sun's heat, but if it were highly polished
to a mirror-like finish, it would reflect
almost all heat radiation and be cold.
One method to assure a constant cabin
temperature would be to reflect all heat
received from the sun, and—as in a
huge thermos bottle-—heat the cabin in-
ternally by mechanical means. Other
methods would utilize heat from the sun.
If one-half the ship were painted black
and the other half highly polished, heat
could be regulated by varying the amount
of dark or bright surface exposed to the
sun. Elaborate and automatic apparatus
would be needed to control the exposure
of the hight surfaces. Perhaps shutters
would be necessary to cover or expose
the heat-absorbing areas, and so insure
a suitable temperature.
In the "temperate belt" which the
Earth occupies between Venus and Mars,
the amount of heat received from the
sun is moderate. So much would be
radiated away on the dark side that the
problem might be to retain enough heat
for comfort rather than to avoid absorb-
ing too much from the sun.
Light Rays
Light rays from the sun are very dif-
ferent in space from what they are on
Earth. The ultraviolet rays on earth are
almost completely filtered by the atmos-
phere; in space these deadly rays are felt
in full force. The walls of a space vehicle,
as well as many other substances, will
stop ultraviolet light, but the rays destroy
binders in paint, plastic or textile material,
and rubber. Thus space suits for use on
planets will be made of special materials
to resist the disintegrating effect of ultra-
violet light.
Ordinary sunlight in space is peculiar
in character. On Earth, light rays, which
travel in a straight path are deflected off
particles of air in the atmosphere, giving
a diffused illumination and providing a
partial light, in the shadows of objects.
Sunlight in space is not diffused by air
particles. The sky appears jet black

with the stars shining. Objects in space
which are in sunlight give off a blinding
glare, while the shadows cast are pitch
black. Human eyes will have to be pro-
tected from this glaring contrast; even so
it is doubtful whether they can endure
this condition. The interiors of space
vehicles will probably be lighted by
artificial means.
Spacial Bullets
Although outer space is considered to
be a huge void, it actually contains pieces
of matter, ranging in size from micro-
scopic dust particles to huge fragments of
stone and metal several hundred feet in
diameter. These bits of matter, known as
meteors, constitute a hazard to space
flight, because a collision with such a space
particle could puncture the sealed cabin
or wreck the ship.
The largest and most solid of the
meteors are believed to be the remains of
a planet which once revolved around the
sun between Mars and Jupiter. Comets
are thought to be streams of meteors—
frozen gases, dust, and solids loosely
clumped together—which revolve around
the sun in elliptical orbits. The micro-
meteors are very small, sand-like par-
ticles, dangerous because of their num-
bers.
Larger meteors and streams of meteors
can be tracked with radar and charted.
Since there are comparatively few large
meteors in space, the chances of encoun-
tering one during flight are remote.
However, the presence of micrometeors
has been detected by high altitude
rockets, which have returned to Earth
with their optical surfaces badly pitted
by the sand-blasting effect of these par-
ticles. Micrometeors will not be quite
as numerous in space as they are in the
upper atmosphere for the Earth is bom-
barded by more than its share of them
because they are attracted by the Earth's
gravity.
The defense against the more numerous
micrometeors is a meteor pumper, a sheet
of metal outside the true walls of the
space vehicle. A one-half-inch steel bump-
er would stop everything up to the size
of a pea. Since the colliding particle
would penetrate the metal and disinte-
grate into a puff of hot gas, the bumper
would be placed one inch from the out-
side armor plate of the space vehicle.
This would allow the particle to pierce it
and disintegrate without damage to the
ship.
The passengers on a space vehicle
will face bombardment by other space
particles, but no meteor bumper of any
thickness will protect him. These are cos-
mic rays, atomic nuclei of hydrogen,
helium, and other elements heavy as nickel
or iron, which charge through space from
no one knows where carrying billions of
electron volts of energy. The human body
has always existed with cosmic rays, but
on Earth they are weakened by the atmos-
phere. The particles strike the air mole-
cules in the upper atmosphere, causing
them to break up into smaller particles,
at the same time losing much of their
energy. The particles which finally reach
the Earth are the result of many of these
collisions, and they are greatly subdued
in force..
Above 120,000 feet, however, cosmic
radiation is unhealthy. Heavier particles
may penetrate three to four inches into
living tissue, damaging the cells. Space
doctors fear that cosmic rays will cause
radiation sickness, similar to the effect of
exposure to atomic radiation. If enough
cells in living tissue are damaged, the
tissue dies, causing death to the indi-
vidual.
Cosmic radiation is perhaps the greatest
question facing the space traveler, due to
the fact that very little is known about
the rays as they occur in space. Authori-
ties believe, however, that the real danger
of cosmic rays lies in the long-term effects
and the cumulative damage to living cells.

took the controls of a weird-looking machine —
culmination of a dream of thirty years. Moments
later it rose from the ground. Though the flight
lasted only a few seconds, the VS-300 became the
first practical helicopter in the United States.
Less than six months after Pearl Harbor, the Air

Since then, rapid developments prove that the
helicopter, most versatile of military aircraft, has
tremendous commercial potentials.
Helicopters of the future will be the product of

One day in September of 1953 Doctor
David Ragone came steaming into Ann
Arbor directly from M. I. T. to assume
his duties as Assistant Professor of Metal-
lurgical Engineering. Dave, as Doctor
Ragone is known to his friends, associates
and students, was to distinguish himself
as one of the best and most popular of
the excellent faculty of the Engineering
College.
Dave is what they call a hustler in
academic circles. Not one for wasting
much time, he got his Bachelors in Metal-
lurgical Engineering in 1951, his Masters
in the same field in 1952 and his Doc-
tor of Science (again in Metallurgy) in
1953- He compiled these degrees at
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
where, he modestly explains, he merely
worked sixteen hours a day while every-
one else was working eight.
Assistant Professor Ragone was born
and bred in New York City. He did,
however, manage to avoid picking up any
telltale accent while he was spreading
the Ragone cheer around the town. Dave
is a scant twenty-four years old, married
and a resident of Ann Arbor. He and his
wife Katherine have a very effective meth-
od of avoiding quarrels over card games;
she plays bridge while he restricts his ac-
tivities in this field to poker. Although he
refutes any talent in the sport, Dave plays
quite a bit of squash. He played for the
cardinal and grey while attending M.I.T.
Mr. Ragone is also an avid golfer. He is
quick to call attention to the fact that he
is also untalented in this field. He backs
up this claim with the fact that he finish-
ed one-hundred and seventy-sixth out of
one-hundred and seventy-six in the Ann
Arbor municipal tournament last year.
Doctor Ragone is a member of many
Metallurgical and Scientific societies.
Among these are: The American Society
for Metals, The American Foundryman's
Asociation, The British Institute of
Metals, The American Asociation for the
Advancement of Science, Sigma Xi, and
Tau Beta Pi. On top of all this, he is
the chapter advisor for the Michigan
chapter of Theta Xi, his fraternity during
his stay on the M.I.T. campus.
At present, Dave is working on three
research projects. One of them is confi-
dential but he will talk freely of the other
two. One is a continuation of his doctor-
ate thesis on the fluidity of metals. The
other is a very practical study on im-
proving the life of automobile headlamp
filaments.
One could fill a book with the rules
and theories Dave uses in his very suc-
cessful teaching. Most of them can be
boiled down by likening each class lec-
ture to a speech. He analyses his audi-
ence and talks accordingly. He claims to
be aided in this analysis by the students
themselves, however. He can tell by
droopy eyelids when he is undershooting
his audience and, when this happens, he
raises the level of the discusion and holds
their interest. On the other hand, when
his audiences become fidigity, he knows
that they are having a little trouble with
the material and slows down accordingly.
Another very successful approach he uses
is to give his class a mental break by
digressing every so often.
A salesman at heart, Dave tries to sell
the subject to his students. His sales tech-
nique? He tells them what he's going to
Prof. Ragone
tell them (that's where the sales come
in). He tells them. And then as a follow
up, he tells them what he told them.
Dave is also a great believer in appealing
to the engineering mind. He tries to ex-
plain concepts by actual demonstration of
models and gadgets which, because of
their practicality, the engineer grasps bet-
ter than abstract notions.
With teaching practices such as these,
it is easy to understand why Dave is so
popular with all his students and why
we say that his success is sure to continue
for many, many years.

he received compensation following his
last recall.
D Unemployment Compensation
The employers liability for guarantee
payments to any worker for any week will
be reduced by an amount equal to the
basic state unemployment compensation
benefit which the worker is entitled to
receive for that week. Special provisions
will be made with respect to the depen-
dents allowances paid under some state
laws.
E Availability for Other Work
(1) Unless otherwise directed by the
employer, a worker laid off for a full
week will be required to register with the
State employment service and to accept
suitable employment.
(2) Standards of "Suitability" will be
specified by the agreement, without re-
gard to any standards that may be pro-
vided in the state unemployment com-
pensation laws, in order to protect work-
ers against pressure to accept jobs paying
sub-standard wages, having sub-standard
working conditions, etc.
(3) If a laid off worker who takes a
suitable job with another employee fails
in any week to earn an amount equal to
his regular earnings with the guarantee-
ing employer, the latter will make up the
difference.
(4) A laid-off worker who takes a
suitable job with another employer will
remain eligible to receive guarantee pay-
ments, if and when again unemployed,
for a period of time beyond the time
when his guarantee payments would have
ceased if he had not found other employ-
ment.
II FINANCING
A Cost of Short Work-Weeks
Costs arising out of short work weeks
or failure to notify workers will be met
by the employer on a pay-as-you-go-basis
and will not be credited against his maxi-
mum liability.
R Cost of Full-Week Layoffs
Costs of payments for full weeks of
layoff will be met by the employer on a
pay-as-you-go basis up to a specified
maximum percentage of his current pay-
roll.
C Reserve Trust Fund
(1) The employer will be required to
make contributions to establish and main-
tain a reserve trust fund to meet costs of
full-week layoffs in excess of a specified
percentage of his current payroll.
2) The employer will be required to
build the reserve trust fund up to and
maintain it at a specified percentage of
his base payroll.
(3) A contribution rate will be speci-
fied in terms of a fixed percentage of base
payroll sufficient to bring the reserve up
to that level within a specified period of
time.
(4) The employer's maximum liability
for current payments for full week layoffs
plus contributions to the trust fund, will
be limited to the percentage of his cur-
rent payoll which will be specified.
(5) After the reserve reaches the re-
quired level further contributions will be
required to be made to the trust fund to
replace withdrawals from the fund, to
adjust to increases in the "base payroll",
or to adjust to unemployment compensa-
tion law amendments or changes in the
terms of reinsurance which would have
the effect of increasing the potential lia-
bilities of the reserve fund.
(6) Provision will be made for reduc-
ing the size of the reserve fund below
the originally specified level if base pay-
roll decreases, unemployment compensa-
tion benefits increase or amounts avail-
able increase due to reinsurance.
Ill ADMINISTRATION
A Joint Board and Committees
(1) The guarantee will be administer-
ed by a Joint Board of Administration
composed of employer and union repre-
sentatives in equal number plus an im-
partial chairman to break all deadlocks.
B Functions of Joint Board
In addition to its other functions the
Joint Board of Administration will inter-
pret the guarantee agreement and will
decide all questions involving eligibility
for guarantee payments, including the
amount and duration of the payments due
any worker, whether work offered him is
suitable, etc. The Board will make its
own independent determination in ac-
cordance with the provisions of the guar-
antee and will not be bound by any de-
termination or finding made under state
unemployment compensation laws.
That in essence is what the UAW-CIO
will press for in negotiations which will
begin this spring. It represents quite a
new concept in the way of pay thinking
for the automotive industry.
Because the industry is so highly com-
petitive, the UAW will wield no little
amount of power when the bargaining
sessions begin. One corporation can hard-
ly afford to let its plants sit idle for any
long period of time lest during the in-
terim they see their position in the sales
race change considerably. The thought
has been posed however, that the cor-
porations might band together in a united
effort to defeat the G.A.W. plan. Again
though, no one really knows what man-
agement feeling is toward the plan.
The Unions believe that the G.A.W.
plan will do much to keep purchasing
power up by supplying the worker with
income during recessions and will tend
to stabilize consumer purchasing power at
least in the areas in which the automotive
industry may be located.
It will also do much for the dignity
and self-respect of the worker in that it
supplies him with steady employment
along with its inherent security. The feel-
ing is that he will become a better and
more permanent asset to his community.
Another consideration is the fact that
once the plan is accepted management
will attempt to regularize employment to
a greater degree than at present. This
means trying as much as possible to level
off the peaks and valleys of annual pro-
duction.
The union (with respect to employ-
ment policies) points to the fact that
management people work the year round
whether the plant is in operation or shut
down. The question they pose is why
should one element of the plant force be
allowed to work while another is sub-
jected to layoffs throughout the year?
They also point out the fact that the
burden imposed upon industry through
adoption of the plan will not be as great
as supposed since it will be integrated
with unemployment compensation ma-
chinery now in effect.
Some of the difficulties of the plan
would be as follows:
(1) Industries would no doubt have
to get together to pool their resources in

STORY TELLER...
Finding the origin of gages is as difficult as enumer-
ating the types of service for which they are used. But
all types of gages have one thing in common . .. they
tell a story. They indicate what's going on in inacces-
sible areas ... or measure things you cannot see.
Whether actuated by physical force, electrical im-
pulse or mechanical means . . . whether fixed or port-
able . . . gages are indispensable to modern civiliza-
tion. They measure the potential of power or pressure
. . . the degree of heat. . . the force, flow or level of
liquids or gases . . . the strength of solids.
MASTER OF MYSTERY...
In industry, gages have replaced guesses. Physicists,
designers, chemists, metallurgists, mechanical and
electrical engineers, and a host of technicians and
craftsmen have sired this scientific servant ... to
work in power and processing plants, in mines and
mills, on highways and skyways, on and under water.
A gage never works alone. Only when it has a point
of contact can it function. And minds, too, must have
a point of contact that will render the behind-the-
scene reports of industry's status. Here, in America,
that function is fulfilled in our all-seeing, all-hearing
and reporting Inter-Communications System.
THE AMERICAN INTER-COM SYSTEM...
Complete communication is the function, the unique
contribution of the American business press ... a
great group of specially edited magazines devoted to
the specialized work areas of men who want to man-
age better, research better, sell better, buy better.
COMMUNICATION IS OUR BUSINESS...
Many of the textbooks in which you are now studying
the fundamentals of your specialty bear the McGraw-
Hill imprint. For McGraw-Hill is the world's largest
publisher of scientific and technical works.
After you leave school, you will want to keep
abreast of developments in your chosen profession.
Then one of McGraw-Hill's many business magazines
will provide current information that will help you
in your job.

Steel Is 2 to 3 time* stronger

Steel costs a third as much

signed in steel can be manu-

WHAT MAKES
A DESIGNER
OUTSTANDING?
TO be successful, a designer must
first know how to develop
products that are profitable to his
company. To be profitable, these
products must meet competition,
yet be manufactured for low cost.
By taking advantage of the bene-
fits of welded steel construction,
the alert design engineer has un-
limited opportunities for develop-
ing new product ideas. He can add
improvements to present products,
make them stronger, more service-
able . . . while actually reducing the
cost of production, as in the ex-
ample shown.
HOW COST IS REDUCED
from 269 Its. to 176 lbs.

the newest developments in steel

one huge fund to establish a workable re-
serve. Many believe it to be a move in the
direction of a government operated fund
since it may be difficult to establish the
amount of responsibility each company
would bear towards the fund. The other
possibility might be governmental con-
tribution to the fund to keep it at a work-
able level.
(2) That the incentive for the average
worker to put in a "good day's work"
would be dulled by a guaranteed wage
the year round.
(3) That unless every company in the
industry adopts the plan, it would result
in a comparative disability to those com-
panies instituting the plan. It is question-
able at this time whether all companies in
the automotive industry can afford the
G.A.W. plan.
(4) Employee purchasing power is
only one ingredient to the problem of an
effective economy. The question arises as
to what extent it may keep management
from expanding their respective enter-
prises. Will the plan reduce the amount
of effective working capital that may be
used for expansion?
(5) The problem of controlling a
cyclical sales program in the industry is
very acute. At present, the great majority
of new cars are sold the first six months
of the year followed by a rapid decline
the remainder of the year until the new
models for the following year are placed
on the market. The UAW seems to feel
that management can stabilize sales by
influencing the consumer to buy the year
round. So far however, I have heard of
no panacea to the problem. Neither Labor
nor Management has come up with a solu-
tion to eliminate cyclical sales.
(6) There is some feeling that the
G.A.W. plan would tend to inhibit the
formation of new enterprise because the
amount of risk inherent with the addi-
tion of the plan would be too great to en-
tice sufficient investment. Labor would
then become an overhead cost and tend to
remain constant throughout the year. This
might scare off investment since a new
enterprise in its formative years is a rather
shaky thing and usually can't guarantee
full employment the year round.
(7) Last but not least is the effect it
may very well have upon those small
companies supplying parts to the indus-
try. General Motors alone has agreements
with over 21,000 parts suppliers spread
throughout the country. If regularization
of employment is the inevitable result of
the G.A.W. plan, won't the industry call
back the needed portion of its sub-con-
tracted work necessary to keep its labor
staff working full time? I have discussed
this issue very generally with a few parts
suppliers and they express a real fear of
what may happen if the plan is adopted.
I would doubt very seriously that any
one would argue with the union's con-
tention that to be employed in the auto
motive industry is for the great majority
a precarious sort of thing. Inherent in the
industry is the fact that one can very
easily suffer from unemployment and sub-
sequent loss of pay at the most inoppor-
tune times. Some times however, we tend
to forget this most cogent point. There is
an old Persian proverb that reads "To he
who wears shoes, it is as if the whole
world were covered with leather." Many
of us outside the industry could afford to
walk barefoot.
To the prospective engineer the subject
of a guaranteed annual wage should be
of utmost importance. Many of you
eventually will be in positions of respon-
sibility requiring a good bit of knowledge
of wage policy. If not the managers of
your own plant, you may very well be
executives in personnel administration,
labor relations or even union representa-
tives. The G.A.W. will definitely be an
item with which you will grapple in the
future. The importance of the issue has
been illustrated on campus by the fact
that the plan has been the subject of dis-
cussion by well known members of the
faculty specializing in labor relations and
economics. The Cooley Essay contest sub-
ject will be the G.A.W. plan and the
jointly sponsored (Cooley Memorial
Foundation and Sigma Rho Tau) Speech
Contest being held this year for the first
time will have as its topic some aspect of
the G.A.W.
Whatever result the bargaining ses-
sions may bring this spring, the proceed-
ings should be highly interesting and in-
formative. The Guaranteed Annual Wage
plan is probably one of the biggest con-
cessions that the unions have ever de-
manded of the automobile industry. What
tactics both sides will use to gain their
end is unknown, but you can bet that the
full resources of both factions will be
brought to the fore during this gargan-
tuan struggle.

By simplifying inspection, this Fafnir-developed, slow
running ball bearing torque tester shrinks the chances of

readings to produce similar information, the Fafnir Torque
Tester requires only one revolution of the bearing outer
ring to record such characteristics as running torque in
gram-centimeters, bearing defects (if any), where located
(inner or outer ring), and the presence of dirt or exces-
sive eccentricities.
The development of a better means of measuring instru-

within a flame of propane and air.
First a special kind of flame had to be
created so that the temperature and gas
compositions might be accurately deter-
mined at closely spaced intervals within
the flame. For this purpose a means was
devised for creating a horizontal flat
flame, i.e. all the burning takes place in a
very short distance vertically. At atmos-
pheric pressure it is almost the size and
shape of a thin pancake; at pressure
equivalent to 65,000 feet altitude it is
somewhat thicker.
To measure the temperature at intervals
of each millimeter vertically, i.e. along
the thin dimension very special thermo-
couples were devised. So that the thermo-
couples would not disturb the gas flow
the wires of platinum and rhodium were
made as small as possible—down to 0.2
of a mil thick, or about one tenth the
diameter of a human hair. Also, to pre-
vent the platinum from acting as a catalyst
in the flame, it had to be coated with an
inert material.

of electrons through metals, there arc-
many, large gaping voids in our under-
standing of the mechanism of that pas-
sage. One of the problems on which
Westinghouse research scientists are vig-
orously working is how conduction elec-
trons (i.e., outer orbital electrons that
can be freed to make amperes) absorb
energy from impinging light, and how
much. The end product of such research
still in its early stages, is data for curves
from which a theory can be drawn. These
results, even these early ones, are of un-
questioned value—but not exciting to the
average engineer. However, some of the
problems and the numbers dealt with in
pursuing this data engender high respect
for the investigators.
For example, the metal specimens must
be polished to a degree that make the sur-
face of even a high-grade telescope mir-
ror look like an array of hills and valleys.
The highest "hill" allowed on the surface-
is about five Angstroms high or
0.00000002 inch. A wavelength of green
light is 1000 times greater.

Powder Metallurgy is Improving
Jet Aircraft
New applications of powder metallurgy
will permit the "breaking" of heretofore
unsolvable engineering problems in the
design of aircraft, Dr. Henry H. Hausner,
Manager of Atomic Energy Engineering,
Sylvania Electric Products Inc., said.
Speaking at the annual meeting of the
American Institute of Mining and Metal-
lurgical Engineers, as chairman of the
Powder Metallurgy Committee, the Syl-
vania scientist stated the trend toward
higher powered aircraft engines has creat-
ed a demand for improved materials that
can take higher operating temperatures.
According to Dr. Hausner, convention-
ally produced metals formerly used for
certain aircraft engine parts do not con-
tain the combination of characteristics
needed in the new high-temperature gas
turbine and jet propelled engines. In an-
swer to the challenge, powder metallurgy
has developed "new" material during the
last few years.
"These materials consist of combina-
tions of metals and non-metals which can-
not be produced by any other presently
known engineering method," he said.
"The new materials made by powder
metallurgy methods will permit the opera-
tion of aircraft engines at higher tempera-
tures and, with considerably greater effi-
ciency."
The chairman of the Powder metal-
lurgy Committee also stated that the auto-
mobile industry in the United States pro-
duced more than 500,000,000 parts made
by powder metallurgy methods for auto-
mobiles and trucks during 1954. The
powder metallurgy industry worked up
more than 35,000,000 pounds of iron
powder during that year.
Commenting on advances in the field
of nuclear energy, Dr. Hausner told the
powder metallurgists that the first nuclear
power reactors to be designed and built
with the help of Government funds will
go into operation within the next two
years. Private industry, which is extreme-
ly interested in operating nuclear power
reactors, has already started with its de-
signs, he said. Noting that Sylvania's
Atomic Energy Division is specializing in
the development of fuel elements for
atomic reactors including power plants,
he estimated that at least 10 privately
financed large, nuclear power plants for
the production of electricity will be built
within the next 10 years.
THE HUMAN BODY
IN SPACE
(Continued from page 38)
More research must be done, to learn
the amount of this radiation to which the
traveler will be exposed and the dose
which his body can safely absorb.
MAN IN THE UNKNOWN
In the not-too-far future, a new hero
will emerge to take his place with the
Polos, Columbuses, and Boones of his-
tory—the spaceman. He and his fellows
will travel through a rocky, airless, hos-
tile space to open new worlds. The hard-
ships he must endure will be the greatest
test of mans adaptability, the true meas-
urement as to whether man is capable of
conquering new worlds or must remain
earthbound.
Technology can do much to make space
travel tolerable, if not comfortable. An
artificial atmosphere, with comfortable
pressure and temperature can be pro-
duced; specially developed equipment
can cushion the spacemans flight, guard
his health, and protect his safety. The
space cabin will be a cramped, dismal
capsule, but man has already succeeded in
living in confined quarters.
The real barrier man must surmount is
fear. The fear of falling, produced by the
weightlessness of space, is in itself a
nightmare, but possibly men can be train-
ed to overcome this fear. The spaceman
will experience countless other fears
which will test his very mental and emo-
tional balance. On a space vehicle man
will live in terror because a simple me-
chanical failure could poison the air he
must breathe, or cause the pressure to
drop to a vacuum. An infinitesimal mis-
take in calculation could result in his be-
ing lost forever. Or the space vehicle
could be torn apart by colliding with a
piece of rock no bigger than a golf ball.
These and other fears will haunt the
space explorer as he embarks upon his
travels to unknown frontiers. The mys-
teries of space are man's greatest chal-
lenge as he stands on the threshold of his
most supreme adventure.

dropped it at that.

The Bumble Bee shuddered and rose.
Slowly—Slowly, and then like a dart it
went out and away from the earth.
Griffin ran outside and craned his neck
upwards. The black speck hung in the
bright blue overhead. Finally it arced—
Griffin rubbed his eyes hard and looked
again. A tight wry smile pulled across
his face as he watched the rocket head
to the southwest.

will have the same hemispherical type
combustion chambers. One of the re-
maining factors in determining M.E.P. is
the compression, the amount the fuel-
air mixture is squeezed before it is ignit-
ed by the spark plug. However, a given
fuel in a definite fuel-air mixture may
only be squeezed a certain amount in
any given type of combustion chamber
before it detonates because of the heat
generated in compressing the gas (fuel-air
mixture) before it is ignited by the spark
plug. Since this predetonation is harmful
to the engine, the compression ratio is
limited by the fixed factors of fuel, fuel-
air mixture ratio, and combustion cham-
ber design; therefore the compression
ratio itself may be considered a constant.
The only factor in determining M.E.P.
which will vary in this discussion is the
efficiency of the induction cycle. This I.E.
(Induction Efficiency) is measured as a
ratio: the weight of fuel-air mixture
which is drawn into the cylinder in one
induction cycle compared to the weight
of mixture which the cylinder could hold
if it were allowed to be completely filled
at room temperature and atmospheric
pressure.3 The M.E.P. is directly propor-
tional to the I.E., and since, in this dis-
cussion, the other variables are assumed to
remain constant, the M.E.P. is assumed
to be a constant times the I.E. (M.E.P. =
c.I.E.)
Two of the other factors determining
horsepower are "1" (the length of the
piston stroke) and "a" (the area of the
piston). The product of the piston area
and stroke ("1" "a") determine the dis-
placement of the engine, which is the fac-
tor limited by racing regulations. Because
this product must be a constant limited by
racing rules, to increase one of these fac-
tors the engineer must decrease the other;
thus, decreasing one factor allows him to
increase the other to retain a constant dis-
placement.
The factor "n"' represents the number
of explosions or power strokes per min-
ute. Each cylinder makes one power stroke
for every two revolutions of the crank
shaft. Therefore:

How to carry 35-ton loads in
a roll-neck lathe
The engineers who designed this roll-neck
lathe were faced with three problems. 1)
To build a lathe that would cut finishing
time as much as 75%; 2) To build a lathe
that would give great accuracy and 3) To
provide great load-carrying capacity as
well. Their answer was this electronically-
controlled mill roll lathe. To carry the 35-
ton loads with a maximum runout of .0003
and still do the job quickly, they specified
Tjmken® tapered roller bearings.

Why TIMKEN® bearings have
high load capacity
This cross-section of a Timken tapered roller bearing
illustrates one reason why Timken bearings do such a
good job under heavy load conditions. Notice that there
is full line contact between the rollers and races. It's this
full line contact that distributes the load over a wider
area, gives Timken bearings their extra load-carrying
capacity.

(Continued from page 58)
Since in any one engine the number of
cylinders is fixed the factor "n" may be
regarded as a constant (t) times the num-
ber of revolutions per minute (R.P.M.).
The original formula for I.H.P.
may be modified as follows. (M.E.P.)
is a constant value times the I.E.
The displacement, the product "I",
"a" is a constant. Also n is a constant
times the R.P.M. Substituting the new
values for the factors in the original
formula, it now reads:
I.H.P. =
(cXl-E.)(I X a) (tX R-P.M.)
33000
The "c", ("1" X "a")&gt; t- and 33000 are
all constants, and may therefore be com-
bined into one constant, which for con-
venience sake will be labeled "k." The
formula now becomes: I.H.P. = k(I.E.)
(R.P.M.). This reads: the horsepower of
an engine of given displacement depends
directly on the product of the induction
efficiency and the number of revolutions
per minute. Thus if either of the factors
I.E. or R.P.M. can be increased without
reducing the other, the horsepower of the
engine will be increased without chang-
ing its displacement.
From appearances, then, one might as-
sume that increasing the R.P.M. would
increase the power in direct proportion; a
second look shows, however, that for this
to be true the I.E. must remain constant.
Unfortunately, it does not. As an engine
turns faster, less time is available to in-
duct a fresh charge into the cylinder. Each
engine has a certain speed where the I.E.
is greatest; that is, where each cylinder
is filled with the maximum possible
charge each time the engine goes through
its cycle.4 Above this speed the I.E. be-
comes less.
"As the speed of the engine is increased
above this speed for maximum charge per
cylinder per cycle, the quantity of charge
will drop off. However, since the engine
speed is increased, more charges will be
inducted during a given period of time.
The air consumption of the engine (or the
quantity of air swallowed during a given
period of time) will continue to rise. In
fact, air consumption will continue to in-
crease with increased engine speed until
some point is reached where the charge

per cylinder per stroke is dropping off
more rapidly than the number of strokes
per time is increasing. The maximum air
consumption point is usually not reached
during the usual operating range in most
engines. Air consumption, then, brings in
a factor of time. Increased air consump-
tion means that increased quantities of
fuel can be added during a given period
of time. This means that the power out-
put, which also includes a time factor,
can thus be increased. In fact, the ibp
[sic] produced in the cylinder is almost
directly proportional to the engine air
consumption.''"
In restatement, then, since the horse-
power of an engine depends directly cn
the amount of air displaced per minute,
if the amount of air displaced per cycle is
limited (by racing regulations and by
I.E.), the amount of air displaced per
minute may be increased by increasing the
number of cycles per minute. In the high
speed range, the I.E. value is dropping off
at a constantly increasing rate; when this
rate of decrease becomes greater than the
rate of increase of R.P.M., the maximum
I.H.P. has been passed. One can see, then,
that greater horsepower is available at
higher R.P.M. provided that the I.E. can
be kept constant or nearly so.
The main reason for the lower efficiency
of the induction cycle at high speeds is
that the intake valve does not remain
open long enough to allow the fuel-air
charge to enter the cylinder. A modifica-
tion of intake valve opening and duration
will raise the speed at which the engine
obtains the maximum charge per cycle
and will increase the I.E. at all speeds
above that speed.6 However, a cam which
opens the valves for a longer period of
time at high speeds will also hold them
open longer at low speeds, and produce
an engine which runs very roughly if at
all at low speeds. A possible remedy to
this situation would be a variable cam,
that is, a cam which could be changed
in contour as the speed of the engine
changed, thus providing the optimum
valve timing at any R.P.M.
Another way to increase the I.E. (or
actually the M.E.P. which depends on the
I.E.) is to supercharge the engine. In an
unsupercharged engine air is forced into
the cylinder by the pressure of the at-
mosphere. The piston on its downstroke
creates a partial vacuum in the cylinder;

the pressure of the outside atmosphere
then forces the air into the cylinder. A
supercharger is a device similar to a
pump; it forces the air into the cylinder
by a pressure greater than that of the at-
mosphere, thus greatly increasing the
weight of the charge in the cylinder and
raising the M.E.P.: This is especially im-
portant at higher speeds where the engine
has less time to induct the charge. (Ac-
tually, a supercharger so greatly raises the
power throughout the whole speed range
that racing classifications specify a much
smaller displacement limit (usually one-
half as great) for supercharged engines
in the same class as unsupercharged. If
the supercharger can increase the M.E.P.
enough to compensate for the lower dis-
placement, it still provides a net gain in
horsepower.) Since the supercharger can
be designed to increase the induction pres-
sure as the speed of the engine increases,
it can maintain the I.E. at a high level
throughout the speed range.
The advantage of high R.P.M. and/or
high supercharge pressures have been
known for a long time, yet racing engi-
neers have held their engines within cer-
tain limits. This limit has not been placed
because some secondary component of
the engine will not operate above a given
speed. Injection-type carburetors and di-
rect fuel-injection units are capable of
pumping, metering, and distributing fuel
to each cylinder of an engine at any feas-
ible speed. Specially engineered valve
gear with compound springs and scientifi-
cally contoured cams will operate valves
at speeds far in excess of those being used
in present engines. Ignition manufacturers
will build (for a price) magneto type
ignitions which will be guaranteed to
operate properly in any speed range the
customer specifies. Cooling and lubrica-
tion systems can also be modified to cope
with higher R.P.M.
The limiting factor preventing high
speed operation has been the durability
of the rotating and reciprocating parts.
Higher R.P.M. increases stresses in an en-
gine. If these stresses become too great, the
engine will literally tear itself to pieces.
An engine which turns too fast creates
enough stress to cause some component
to fail, and when a part of an engine
that is turning at extremely high speed
fails, that failure is likely to cause some
other part to fail, and the whole engine
may be ruined in a split second. A certain
amount of gain in the maximum obtain-
able R.P.M. of an engine may be made
by the costly process of overspeeding the
engine to cause failure, locating among
the ruins the specific part which first fail-
ed, strengthening that part in a similar
engine, running that engine to failure,
and repeating the process. This method
can be employed to advantage in any en-
gine, but eventually a limit is reached
where the cost of further increase of
strength of component parts is excessive
weight, for when a part has been designed
by metallurgical and stress engineers to its
maximum strength for a certain weight,
the only way to further strengthen it is to
increase its weight. This excess weight is
undesirable for two reasons. First, it de-
feats its own purpose because the heavier
part (one which is rotating or recipro-
cating at high R.P.M.) creates greater
stresses, sometimes enough more so that
a lighter, weaker part is in effect stronger
than a heavy one. Second, it causes a more-
rapid rise in the internal friction of the
engine as the R.P.M. rises. In the horse-
power formulae given on pages 2 and 4,
the internal friction, which must be sub-
tracted from the I.H.P. to get the B.H.P.
(Brake Horse-Power, the actual power de-
livered by the engine), was ignored."
Heavier moving parts may cause enough
extra friction to offset the gain in I.H.P.
for the increased R.P.M. that the heavier
part might permit. For these reasons, the
problem of designing an engine for high
R.P.M. should be approached from the
positive viewpoint of designing to pro-
duce lower stresses rather than the nega-
tive way of designing parts strong enough
to cope with higher stresses. Of course
the engine which has been designed for
lower stress must be "debugged," that is,
tested for component weakness and modi-
fied where necessary.
A high rotative speed can develope
enough stress in the rotating parts of an
engine to cause failure, but if these rotat-
ing parts have been dynamically balanc-
ed,9 their point of failure will be well
beyond the speed reached in a reciprocat-
ing type o fengine. The critical factor in
creating stress is the piston speed, that is,
the average velocity of the pistons in their
reciprocating motion. The piston speed is
directly dependent on two factors, the
R. P. M. and the stroke. The engineer
wants to keep the piston speed low to re-
duce stress, but he wants to keep the
R.P.M. high to increase the horsepower.
Therefore to reduce piston speed he must
reduce the other factor, the stroke. But re-
ducing the stroke reduces the displace-
ment, which in turn reduces the horse-
power. Previously displacement was
shown to be the product of stroke and
piston area. Therefore the engine designer
increases th episton area to retain the
same displacement with a shorter stroke.
If for physical reasons he does not want
to increase the area of the individual pis-
ton above a certain value, he can retain the
same total displacement by increasing the
number of cylinders, thus increasing the
other power factor "n", instead of "a", to
compensate for the reduction in stroke
"1". In any case he must hold the total
displacement (individual piston area
times stroke times the number of cylin-
ders) within the limit of the class in
which he wants to qualify. By this reduc-
tion in stroke he has greatly increased
the maximum R.P.M. obtainable (this
is an inverse proportion, for example: an
engine with a 2" stroke can turn exactly
twice as fast as one with a stroke of 4"
and still retain the same piston speed.)
In summary, then, a direct way to ob-
tain more horsepower with a limited dis-
placement is to design an engine to run
at extremely high R.P.M. Such a design
should incorporate a short stroke, with
the displacement provided by large piston
area and multiple cylinders. Provision
must be made for adequate air intake,
either by special cams or a supercharger
or both. (In the event of a supercharger
the displacement must be reduced to stay-
in the same racing class.) The most out-
standing feature of its design must be,
however, the short stroke necessary to
permit high R.P.M.

In studying the dynamic behavior of electrical circuits and systems the engineering student learns to
solve and to understand the solutions of differential equations. The electronic differential analyzer, shown
above, allows students to observe and study the behavior of dynamic systems first hand. The components
of an electronic differential analyzer are interconnected to form the electrical analog of the differential
equation being studied. Once the equation is set up, solutions are observed on a 4-channel recorder; and
the students are able to observe immediately the effect on the solutions of each parameter of interest on
the solutions. These direct observations of the influence of various system parameters assist the student in
his understanding and develop his engineering judgment. This analyzer has proven useful for classroom
demonstration, graduate research, and laboratory experiments in the fields of analog computation, servo-
mechanisms, radio communications, industrial electronics and vacuum tubes. An understanding of the design
and application of digital computers has also become an important part of the electrical engineer's back-
ground in recent years. The Electrical Engineering Department offers a number of courses in this field and
is currently engaged in the design and construction of a digital computer particularly for teaching purposes.
The Electrical Engineering curriculum, in addition to the basic background required for all engineering
students, consists of fundamental training in electrical circuits and machinery, measurements, electric and
magnetic fields, and electron devices. During his senior year, a student may specialize to a limited extent
in machinery, automatic controls, power generation and transmission, electron tubes, or radio communica-
tion. Graduate training permits the student to extend his study in these fields or to study problems in the
areas of servomechanisms, digital and analog computers, nuclear engineering, circuit synthesis, microwave
engineering, physical electronics, electric and magnetic properties of materials, electrocoustics, instrumen-
tation, power systems and stability, illumination, antennas and propagation, and information theory.

to see what the rising role of science in industry and war gives them a
pivital position in social strategy, and points to the time when their
organized strength will persuade the world to call them to leadership.
Perhaps science has not yet merited the mastery of the world; and per-
haps in a little while it will."
—Will Duranl
It's been twenty years and more since philosopher Durant
made this observation, and twenty more significant years in
the history of science would be difficult to find. In two short
decades, this wise man's words have attained a pertinence
which surely even Mr. Durant never expected them to
attain.
For many years the position of the scientist in our society
has been a rather artificial one. When the men of science
developed cannons, the military men and politicians took
them and fought wars and killed very effectively and gave
the men in the labs an approving nod, a "Well done!,"
and sent them back to develop torpedoes. The men of sci-
ence then produced torpedoes and the military men and
politicians gave the men in the labs an approving nod, a
"Well done!", and sent them back to develop mustard
gas. And so on, for a long time.
This relationship worked out quite well; the scientists
were happy discovering new toys of destruction and the
military men and politicians saw that these discoveries
weren't wasted. About fifteen years ago, however, the men
of science were set to work with a special urgency; the
politicians had failed once more and they needed something
big, something to pull them out of the mess but fast. Five
years later the "something big" came out of the labs and
we had Hiroshima and Nagasaki. And, unexpectedly, some-
thing, or rather some one, else came out of the labs too;
the scientists finally made a big enough bang that even
they came out to see what was happening. The artificial
partition separating scientists from their works collapsed
with a 20 kiloton explosion. It looks like some of the sci-
entists are out in the world to stay, and even those that
aren't are beginning to think about something besides
neutrinos and mesons.
If achievement is synonomous with merit, then certainly,
in Mr. Durant's words, science has come to merit mastery
of the world and scientists, since Hiroshima not content to
wait for their world to call them, are demanding some part
in the leadership of this world.
But, as must be perfectly obvious to any one who reads
newspaper headlines, the scientists are having a little
trouble adjusting to the light of day, and their tasks as lead-
ers of public opinion (and public legislation) have in sev-
eral cases found them sorely wanting. J. Robert Oppen-
heimer's failure accents the problems of the scientist-who-
would-a-leader-be. The oblique approach, the methods of
negotiation and compromise, the necessity for a man to
stand on his reputation, not only on his achievement are not
the ways and methods of a scientist but are the ways and
methods and prime requisites of any democratic politician.
In short, what we demand from the scientist as a leader
bears little relation to what we demanded from him as a
scientist.
Scientists are, I believe, beginning to realize this; at least,
those young people at the Universities who will be tomor-
row's physicists, chemists, and engineers seem to be show-
ing less inclination to bury themselves in their test tubes
and equations than in the past. I think in time we can de-
velop a class of scientists who are also politicians and lead-
ers, but at the present time, when we need such people
so badly, they seem pretty scarce.
As far as I can see, there is no solution to the problem but
time. The awakening of the scientific world to the rest of
humanity has proceeded far enough so that no one is going
back to sleep in the near future. But the transformation of
scientists into leaders, at least at the present time, seems to
be a rough one, and the re-education a process of trial and
error.
Let's be patient and hope the trials are brief and none of
the errors too serious.

speaks from experience when he says,
"Men with ability and ambition really have
a chance to get ahead at U. S. Steel"
• A responsible position can come
quickly to those graduate engineers at
U.S. Steel who show ability and ambi-
tion. Management training programs
are designed to stimulate and develop
these qualities as the trainee "learns by
doing." His training is always a fascin-
ating challenge and he works with the
best equipment and the finest people in
the business.
James Chisholm is typical of the
young men who rapidly rise to an im-
portant position at U.S. Steel. Jim
came to U.S. Steel as a trainee in 1941
after graduating as an M.E. Shortly
thereafter he entered military service
for four years. Upon his return to U.S.
Steel in 1946, he advanced steadily un-
til, in 1951, he was appointed to his
present position as Assistant Superin-
tendent of Blast Furnaces at the new
Fairless Works at Morrisville, Pa.
Jim is now in charge of the unload-
ing of all ore ships and the operation of
the plant's two big blast furnaces—each
with a rated output of 1500 tons per day.
Jim feels that the opportunities for
graduate engineers are exceptional at
U.S. Steel. He remarked that in his own
department alone, six college trainees
have been put into management posi-
tions within the last couple of years. He
says that chances for advancement are
even better now with the current expan-
sion of facilities and the development
of new products and markets.

Jules Verne's dream came true. Around the world in a submarine. Here
the author explains the workings of the Mark II nuclear power plant which
makes it possible.
September 30, 1954, marks an im-
portant date in the history of Man's con-
quest of the sea. On this day the first ves-
sel ever to employ nuclear power left its
dock at Groton, Connecticut, proceeding
by its own power. This vessel was the
submarine USS Nautilus (SSN-571),
a craft believed to be capable of circling
the world at speeds exceeding 20 knots
(knot = 6080 ft. per hour). Such a feat
has not been approached even remotely
by any submarine in the past.
The main feature that makes the Nau-
tilus so unique among other sub-
marines is, of course, its source of power
—a nuclear reactor. Conventional sub-
marines, when completely submerged, de-
rive their power from batteries, and, con-
sequently have to come to the surface
after covering one hundred miles or so,
to recharge their batteries. The diesel
engines that propel the craft when on the
surface cannot be used in a completely
submerged position for the very simple
reason that they require oxygen for com-
bustion. This crippling disadvantage can
be eliminated by a nuclear power plant
which requires no oxygen, and needs no
refueling for many thousands of miles.
The reactor that provides the Nauti-
lus with its power is the STR (Sub-
marine Thermal Reactor) Mark II, a close
copy of the experimental land prototype
STR Mark I reactor that was constructed
first to enable nuclear physicists and engi-
neers to study, develop, and test every de-
tail and component that was to be incor-
porated into the new submarine power
plant. Both reactors were built by the
Westinghouse Electric Corporation under
contract with the U. S. Navy and the
Atomic Energy Commission.
Before beginning to discuss specifical-
ly the reactor of the USS Nautilus, I
believe that some of the fundamental
principles of controlled nuclear fission
should be explained. Nuclear fission is
the process of splitting the nucleus of an
atom( an atom of uranium 235 in this
case) into two approximately equal parts
by striking it with neutron. The fission of
U-235 is accompanied by the evolution of
vast amounts of energy, resulting from the
transformation of a small fraction of its
mass into pure energy. The fissioning of
1 lb. of the U-235 isotope produces heat
equivalent to that produced when about
300,000 gallons of oil are burned.
This energy initially appears in several
forms, but most of it is immediately
changed to heat; thus, for practical pur-
pose, it may be said that the energy ap-
pears as heat.
When a U-235 nucleus fissions, on the
average 2 or 3 fast neutrons are produced
during or immediately following the
process (within a few seconds), most of
which, under ordinary circumstances in
natural uranium (containing only about
0.72% U-235), fly off with great speed
until they finally hit a nucleus of some
atom and are absorbed by it, or are mere-
ly slowed down by numerous collisions,
without ever striking another U-235 nu-
cleus. Since it is known that a U-235
nucleus usually fissions only when it is
struck by a thermal (slow, traveling at
molecular velocities) neutron, the secret
of a self-sustaining nuclear reactor lies in
producing a condition when one of the
several fast neutrons produced by a fission
is slowed down to thermal velocities and
causes another fission. The first require-
ment is met by having the neutron collide
with the molecules of some substance that
is not a good neutron absorber, thus slow-
ing it down. Such a substance is called a
moderator. The second requirement is
usually met by two methods: (1) by
using enriched uranium (uranium con-
taining more than the natural relative
amount of the U-235 isotope) as fuel,
and (2) by increasing the amount of fuel
present and the compactness of the core
(fuel plus moderator) of the reactor.
When for every fission one new fission
is produced, the reactor is said to be
critical; movable control rods of a neu-
tron absorbing substance are then used to
control the reactivity of the reactor or to
shut it down. It is important that the re-
activity does not exceed the critical point
for any length of time, since this would
result in a rapidly increasing power out-
put that might become disastrous. In
most practical power reactors such as the
STR reactors, the reactivity can be con-
trolled both by semi-automatic or manual
controls.
The heat from the core of a reactor is
removed by a primary coolant (usually
water or a liquid metal) that is piped
through and around the core, if the core
itself is solid as in the case with the
Nautilus' reactor.
The Mark II power plant. The STR
Mark II reactor is a water cooled and
moderated thermal reactor with a hetero-
geneous core containing highly enriched
uranium as fuel.
In order that an adequate heat transfer
surface may be obtained, the core consists
of the enriched uranium fuel alloyed with
other materials, principally a hitherto
little known metal, zirconium. The ma-
terials that were to constitute the core had
to possess high resistance to radiation
damage, corrosion, and shock. In addi-
tion, the core materials had to be non-
neutron absorbers.
The expensive and little used metal
zirconium had been found to possess the
required properties. Because of the sud-
den demand for the metal in water-
cooled nuclear reactors, a highly inten-
sive program of research and study of the
chemistry and metallurgy of zirconium
was launched by the AEC and Westing-
house. Thus, in three years zirconium has
evolved from a laboratory "curiosity"

What are we doing in acoustics at Michigan?
When we use the word acoustics we
usually think of sound, and this brings
forth ideas of sophomore physics where
we studied sound waves for about two
weeks. The waves were complicated and
the problems were hard. When we pass-
ed this part of the course it was time to
celebrate. But I can remember a lecture
that Dr. Neil Williams used to give in
the West Physics Lecture Room where he
would place a fifty cent piece inside a
physics book and then make this hidden
coin visible by standing the book in front
of an x-ray screen. He would walk to the
last row of seats in the ampitheater to
make certain that all students there could
see the coin inside the book. Then he-
would triumphantly announce that this
clearly demonstrated that they could sec-
through physics and there was money in
it too! The same thought might be ap-
plied to the science of acoustics.
At the University of Michigan today
acoustical work overlaps many fields. For
example, we find research on the ear and
hearing in the Medical School and the
Institute of Industrial Health, courses in
electrocoustics in the Electrical Engineer-
ing Dept. of the Engineering College, re-
search and course work on the acoustics
of speech in the Speech Department of
the Literary College, research on musical
acoustics in the School of Music, a course
in architectural acoustics in the School of
Architecture and Design. The Engineer-
ing Research Institute participates in
rather extensive contract research work in
this field also. It is not uncommon to find
a psychologist working on an ERI project
with an electrical engineer and a mathe-
matician, or to find a physicist and a mu-
sician both studying the tone quality of a
clarinet. This cooperation among special-
ists of widely different background is a
highly desirable situation. It tends to
break down the artificial but often formid-
able walls which build up around a
limited field of activity, and it gives one
a better understanding of the other man's
problem. In fact, one of the outstanding
advantages of a large university such as
Michigan over a purely technical or engi-
neering school is this mixing of ideas and
this communication between quite differ-
ent groups of people taking place here.
One of the problems of our modern
society is noise. We can build airplanes to
fly faster than the speed of sound and
locomotives that are more efficient and
powerful than their predecessors, but
along with all this advance in technology
everything seems to get noisier. How
would you like to live next door to a jet
air base and have the noise level in your
living room so high that you want to duck
every time a plane takes off? What will
cities do with nearby airfields when the
commercial airlines start flying jet powered
planes? New York's La Guardia field with
jet planes landing and taking off might
occasion 100,000 or more complaints a
day because of the high noise. Even the
present pilots are given instruction to
climb as rapidly as possible in order to cut
the time they will raise the decibels un-
comfortably high in residential and office
areas, and the future is none too bright.
The problem of noise reduction and meas-
urement is no new one at the University
of Michigan. Dr. Paul Geiger was a
pioneer in this field, and he made notable
contributions toward the development of
the sound level meter which is now ac-
cepted as the most practical method for
measuring acoustical noise transmitted in
air. Many mechanical devices ran more
quietly thanks to his efforts. These cover-
ed a wide range from automobiles and
diesel engines down to household appli-
ances such as vacuum cleaners and wash-
ing machines. The door on your automo-
bile does not rattle or sound as if it were
made of tin-can material largely because
of his efforts.
The human factor is especially signifi-
cant in noise reduction work since it is
Lawrence Monahan and Wallace Enderle measure noise and vibration of an experi-
mental alternator in the Electrical Engineering laboratories.

tion of sound that tells us how noisy
something really is. If we double the in-
tensity of a noise, it does not in general
sound twice as loud to us. Also, high and
low frequency sounds do not seem near-
ly as loud to us as those in the middle of
our hearing range. When judgement of
various observers enters into engineering
work the road is not always straight and
clear as the story of a lady asked to judge
a number of vacuum cleaners will illus-
trate. The sound experts expected her to
select the cleaner making the least noise.
Instead she picked the very noisiest vac-
uum cleaner as being the best since it was
quite obvious to her that in making all
this noise it did more work than the
others and therefore removed more dirt!
Visiting the Cooley Memorial building
on the north campus you will find at one
end of this building a very special room.
This is a reverberation chamber. It is sup-
ported on a separate foundation from the
main building to keep structure borne
sound from interfering with the measure-
ments going on inside, and the walls of
the reverberation room are made of very
dense material to reflect almost all of the
sound incident upon them. Richard
Hamme and a group of research physi-
cists and engineers are here carrying on
the work of Geiger in the measurement
and reduction of noise and the investiga-
tion of the acoustical properties of ma-
terials. The U. S. Navy is especially inter-
ested in this research in line with its aim
to reduce the noise on ships. In the
Kresge Building near the U. of M Hos-
pital Dr. Merle Lawrence is conducting
research in the field of otology, the sci-
ence of the ear and its diseases. It is well
known today that exposure to very intense
sounds over prolonged periods of time
will cause damage to the ear. A worker
exposed to the noise of a boiler factory
or that of a pneumatic air hammer day
after day with sound pressures levels of
100 decibels or more can expect hearing
impairment unless special ear plugs are
worn. In fact, certain states, notably Wis-
consin and New York, award disability
compensation where the employee can
demonstrate loss of hearing sensitivity
and exposure to damaging noise on the
job. The legal questions aroused are in-
deed formidable, and manufacturers are
becoming acutely aware of the noise prob-
lem where it opens the way to damage
suits. The research worker too is hard
pressed to define accurately what sounds
are dangerous. The use of animals in
such research is evident.
MAY, 1955
A model of the underwater sound velocity meter about to be lowered in the ocean
for tests. This meter was developed at the University of Michigan.
The ear is truly a remarkable device. In
its most sensitive frequency region it is
capable of detecting sounds so weak that
the amplitude of motion of the air par-
ticles is no greater than about one tenth
the diameter of the hydrogen molecule!
This is only slightly above the noise level
of the Brownian movement and would in-
dicate that our hearing, at least at certain
frequencies, is as sensitive as is possible
to attain. The minimum perceptible sound
at a frequency of 1000 cycles per second
is commonly used as the beginning of the
decibel scale. On this basis a 100 decibel
sound has ten thousand million times the
intensity of the barely perceptible sound.
Some dynamic range! Research work on
hearing and the ability of an observer to
detect signals in the presence of interfer-
ence is one of the activities of the Elec-
tronics Defense Group, a part of the U.
of M. Engineering Research Institute lo-
cated on the north campus. The observers
working for this group and using head-
phones are asked to listen to a certain
desired signal, often a pure tone. Next
they are exposed to various types of inter-
ference, the most common being "white
noise" which contains all frequency com-
ponents. The use of the word "white" in
connection with sounds is a carry over
from light where you will recall that
white light contained all frequency com-
ponents in the visible frequency spectrum.
White noise is very much like a hissing
sound. The EDG observers are forced to
make a choice of yes or no on whether
they hear the signal, and they have no
way of knowing if the man behind the
control panel actually turned it on or not.
Many interesting conclusions are gained
from these tests which help in the under-
standing of auditory perception. Some-
times the observers get quite discouraged,
and they feel that they are simply guess-
ing. But the guessing turns out to be sur-
prisingly correct.
Another acoustics activity at the U. of
M. is being carried out in the Speech Re-
search Laboratory under the direction of
Dr. Gordon Peterson in room 2006 An-
gell Hall. The facilities of this laboratory
have been expanded and modernized in
the past several years, and the laboratory
now includes the basic instruments of
electro-acoustical research. A sound spec-
trograph is used to record the rapidly
changing frequencies and intensities in-
volved in speech. One project underway
concerns a study of the problems involved
in the automatic synthesis of speech from
small segments removed from actual ut-
terances. The cutting and juncture of
short segments of speech without transi-
ents is one of the problems of instrumen-
tation concerned here. Sharing the same
laboratory is a musical acoustics group
under the direction of William Stubbins,
Associate Professor of Band Instruments.

What? Why? The author answers these and many other questions about
styrene, which is now produced at the rate of 320 million pounds a year.
Before World War II the plastics in-
dustry was like the "watched pot" that
never boiled. Chemists fussed over plas-
tics, developing all sorts of new varieties.
Industries had pushed plastics for all they
were worth. Volumes were written on the
great potential in plastics. But somehow
nothing materialized from these efforts,
and enthusiasm and interest began to die
out. Business men began looking else-
where for excitement. No sooner were
their backs turned then, with the advent
of World War II, the pot began to boil
violently, splattering all over, aand caus-
ing a general uproar.
Today all of us are aware of how wide-
ly "splattered" plastics have become.
Television sets, upholstery, cameras,
dishes, wall tile, refrigerators, automo-
biles, and musical instruments have all
become dependent on plastics. Tele-
phones are plastic. Clothes are plastic.
Everywhere you turn, there are plastics.
Plastics have boomed. To put the facts
into cold figures, the plastics industry has
grown from 250 million pounds of ma-
terial produced in 1938 to 2 billion 800
million pounds a year in 1953 and 1954.
Riding high in this upswing have been
the styrene resins. This is the type of
plastic familiar to us as plastic toys, re-
frigerator trays, kitchen utensils, and pic-
nic dishes. Here is an industry so eager
to grow and expand that, although sales
have increased from 180 million to 320
million pounds of material in seven years,
it finds itself with surplus processing
equipment in anticipation of a goal of 4
to 5 hundred million pounds of material
a year in the near future. Here is an in-
dustry growing so rapidly that some of

last year's models have not been com-
pletely examined and understood by the
chemists. Here is an industry which is
turning its products to uses that were de-
clared impossible 5 years ago. It might be
interesting to know just why it is that
polystyrene can ride so high on the wave
of the plastics boom.
What Is It?
The polystyrene on the market today is
one of the man-made thermoplastic plas-
tics. Now, to explain what that means,
let us first consider the term plastics. Ac-
cording to the U. S. Tariff Commission
which keeps industrial statistics on plas-
tics, plastics are defined as "the synthetic
resins and certain cellulose compounds."
Synthetic rubber, shellac, rosin, and as-
phalt are left out of this definition. The
synthetic resins, in paints, varnishes and
laminates are included in this definition.
The basic plastic raw materials are petro-
chemical or coal-tar chemicals—acetylene,
ethylene, styrene, ethylene, and the like.
All plastics which fall under the above
definition are either thermoplastic or ther-
mosetting. Thermosetting plastics are
those which undergo a chemical reaction
when subjected to heat and pressure.
Once formed into a product they cannot
be remelted. For this reason they are
sometimes called irreversible plastics.
Thermoplastic plastic, however, undergo
only a physical change upon processing.
They can be melted, frozen, and remelted,
like water. For this reason they are some-
times called reversible plastics.
Besides being a thermoplastic plastic,
polystyrene can also be called a polymer
of styrene. Today polymers are defined as
a material consisting of the same elements
in the same proportion by weight but of
different molecular weight than the orig-
inal, such as cyanuric acid (C3N303H,)
is a polymer of cyanic acide (CNOH).

tious formula QH5CH:CH2.
So, we can now say with some degree
of understanding that the thermoplastic
plastic, polystyrene, is a polymer of sty-
rene.
How is it Made?
Polystyrene has been known to occur in
small quantities in coal tar for quite a
while. This amount is so small compared
to the demand for the material that all
the polystyrene sold today is made syn-
thetically. To make a long story, short,
here is what is done. Ethylene gas from
petroleum and benzene from coal are re-
acted to form ethylbenzene. By the ap-
plication of heat and pressure in the
proper still ethylbenzene is broken down,
or "cracked", and styrene is one of the
products obtained. It is then distilled to
purity and polymerization follows. This
polymer, in the form of a crystal is
blended with various coloring agents and
mixed together. What comes out of all
this are granules of polystyrene ready to
be molded.
The molding operation, in which the
polystyrene is shaped into all the familiar
types of articles, is a complete industry
in itself. There are so many problems in-
volved that it would take a whole article
just to get introduced to the subject. How-
ever there are some general methods that
can be explained. Most styrene products
are injection molded. In this process the
molten styrene is injected into a closed
mold under pressure. When it solidifies
it is ejected by the machine. Recent im-
provements in procedures and design of
equipment have made it possible to mold
a piece as large as a complete television
cabinet in one piece. Such advancement
as this in a related field has helped the
styrene industry to grow larger.
A second type of molding operation
is called vacuum forming. Styrene, when
made into sheets, is heated and placed
over a mold. When the air is drawn from
between the sheet and the mold the plas-
tic forms over the mold. After a finish-
ing operation the piece is ready for sale.
Injection molding and vacuum forming
are the two most important ways of shap-
ing styrene.
What Are Its Properties?
It is understandable that a plastic as
well-known and versatile as polystyrene
should have many desirable properties.
Here is part of that long list. First of all,
polystyrene is one of the lightest plastics
Dow Chrmiral Co.
Extruding continuous lengths of Styron 475 sheet.
in use today. It has a specific gravity of
1.05. From there the list includes good
dielectric properties, low water absorption,
resistance to burning and perhaps the two
most important, a wide, available color
range and low cost. The color range is
unlimited ranging from crystal clarity to
translucent to opaque in thousands of
shades. Special effects such as metallic
gleam or phosphorescence can be obtain-
ed. On top of this, colors can be dupli-
cated with comparative ease.
The polystyrenes are one of the lowest
cost plastics, as I have noted. This low cost
puts them into service where plastics with
better properties are unavailable because
of the high cost. The picture isn't all roses,
however. Even though styrene is a low
cost plastic it is not a low cost material.
It cannot compete with metals and wood
on a cost basis. Styrene must prove itself
so much better qualified for a job that
the extra cost is justified. There are other
drawbacks. Anyone who has ever bought
a styrene utensil knows that it is quite
brittle, will not stand boiling water, scour-
ing powder, steel wool, nail polish, nail
polish remover, citrus fruits, and house-
hold solvents. It cannot stand long
periods of weathering either. The addi-
tion of small quantities of rubber to the
styrene has helped to cut down the brit-
tleness. Material containing small amounts
of rubber can be seen in the new model
refrigerators. Better design techniques
and proper use of styrene materials can
cut down the faulty effects of the brittle-
ness also. Another type of styrene has
been developed which will withstand
higher temperatures, in an effort to com-
plaints against low melting points.
Even with these few drawbacks this
still leaves thousands of applications
available for jobs which call for a strong,
durable, dielectric material in attractive
colors. Styrene has filled many of these
jobs.
What Is It Used For?
Styrene has many uses in the home. It
has so many uses, in fact, that I doubt if
there is a home in America that does
not have at least one object made from
this material. Let us take a tour of a
"plastics" household and see what we
find styrene being used for.
Upon entering the living room, styrene
objects are everywhere. The candy dishes
are polystyrene. So are the toys Junior
has scattered around. In fact the radio,
the TV set, the air conditioner, and
vacuum cleaner contain styrene.
In the bedroom we might find a jewel
box, coat hanger, even the alarm clock,
containing styrene parts.
In the bathroom all the racks and
brackets for hanging towels, toothbrushes,
and tumblers are styrene. The tile on the
wall is styrene. In fact, even the bristles
in the hairbrush are styrene.
However, it is in the kitchen that sty-
rene really comes into its own. Pitchers,
thermos jugs, dishes, glasses, refrigerator
dishes, even large portions of the refrig-
erator itself, are all styrene. Some of the
food on the shelves comes packed in sty-
rene containers. The serving trays are
styrene. Even the wall might have styrene
in it. In the form of a foam, styrene is
often used as an insulator.
Even if we were to go to the attic or
down in the fruit cellar styrene objects
might be found. And the uses of styrene
in the home and on the job are growing.
So, I imagine that you have met styrene.
And, you will get to know it better.

by HAROLD G. SIEGGREEN
The shell mold process came to the
fore several years ago and engineers
found that by research and study they
could favorably adapt the method to
the making of high-volume castings prev-
iously made by conventional green sand
practices. This research and study has
continued without interruption and the
number of applications for shell molding
has grown steadily. The future for this
new field looks increasingly fruitful as
foundry engineers learn more and more
about sands, binders, metal selection,
flow characteristics, equipment and pat-
tern design, and other factors which are
making this thin-mold process a wel-
comed one in the foundry industry. The
following article describes the use and
advantages of shell molding at the Cen-
tral Foundry Division of General Motors.
The advantages of the shell mold proc-
ess are rapidly being recognized in the
metal-working industry. The method gets
its name from the thickness of the mold,
which is merely a shell of plastic-bonded
sand, approximately 5/16 in. thick. The
process has brought about a drastic change
in the appearance and weight of the mold
necessary to produce a given part and has
enabled foundries to supply more accurate
and cleaner castings to the users, who are
the ultimate beneficiaries of the atten-
dant economies. While advances in
shell molding during recent years have in-
creased the acceptance of the process by
foundry engineers, the conventional green
sand method remains as the most widely
used means of producing castings.
The shell mold method of producing
castings was developed in Germany dur-
ing World War II. Instead of using the
regular foundry sand mixture which has
clay and water as binders, a fine dry sand
mixed with phenolic resin is applied to a
pattern heated to approximately 450° F.
The resin melts and flows in between the
grains of sand. This feature, plus the cur-
ing on the pattern, produces a hard and
smooth mold which is just as accurate as
the pattern itself.
No jolting, squeezing, or ramming of
a shell mold is needed as is the case in
green sand molding. The corresponding
requirement in the shell mold process is
Reprinted from General Motors Engineering Journal
that the sand mixture must be dropped
on a pattern face. A simple shell molding
machine consists of an open-faced box
which can be turned on trunnions in the
center of the box. The resin and sand
mixture is poured into the box to a depth
of approximately 10 in. to 12 in. The
pattern plate is clamped, with the pattern
face down, to the open face of the box
and the box is inverted. The length of
time the mixture is exposed to the hot
pattern determines the thickness of the
shell. Usually, 15 sec. to 25 sec. exposure
time will result in a shell ]/4 in. to 5/16
in. thick. The box is then reverted to its
original position and the pattern with the
soft shell adhering to it is removed and
placed in an oven for curing. With an
oven temperature of approximately
1,200° F, a curing time of 30 to 60 sec.
is required.
The pattern and the shell are then re-
moved from the oven. The shell is strip-
ped from the pattern and, although it is
still warm, it is actually ready for
use. Of course, iron cannot be pour-
ed until the two halves of the shell are
fastened together. This is done by placing
the drag half of the shell in a gluing
fixture and bonding the cope to it with a
phenolic binder.
At Central Foundry Division all pro-
duction shells are poured in a horizontal
position and without the use of back-up
material. The castings are shaken out with
ease after the required cooling time, due
to the complete burning away of the resin
bond in the areas adjacent to the casting
cavities. The sand does not adhere to the
casting surface as is usually the case in
green sand practice.
Advantages to the Foundry
There are many characteristics of the
shell mold process beneficial to the foun-
dry. One advantage results from the lesser
amount of sand which needs to be pur-
chased and handled. Further, complete
mechanization of the molding operation is
possible for high-production runs. Also,
relatively unskilled labor can be employed
and working conditions are greatly im-
proved. Since completed shell molds can
be stored, stocks of molds can be built up
to pour at a subsequent time. Because the
shell mold surfaces are already clean and
smooth, a minimum amount of finishing
in the cleaning room is required.
Shell Process Applied to Castings Difficult
to Mold
This process is particularly advantag-
eous for quick and simple production of
complicated molds, such as those requir-
ing narrow and accurate passages and sec-
tions. In some cases, it is practically im-
possible to produce certain parts in any
other way without prohibitive machining
costs.
One such part is the gray iron manual-
control valve body for the automatic
transmission of an amphibious, cargo-
carrying military vehicle. Aluminum
die castings were unsatisfactory for
this particular application because of
adverse expansion and wear characteris-
tics. In this case, the requirement for very
close tolerances on the thickness and loca-
tion of intricate ports was made possibly
by the shell mold process. For a casting
of a 5!/2-in. length, dimensional tolerance
of ±0.003 in. to ±0.005 in. per in.
would be conventional for shell castings.
The governor bodies and bushings for
an automatic transmission were formerly
made of aluminum die castings, but the
steel piston rings used in conjunction wjth
the aluminum governor body caused ex-
cessive wear in the ring grooves. In the
past, it had not been possible to cast these
parts in a ferrous material because of the
intricate coring involved. However, by
making the cores of a mixture of phenolic
resin and sand and using the shell mold
process, this has now become a relatively
simple job to cast in grey iron. Over
4,500 pieces of each part are being pro-
duced daily. It has been reported that
excessive wear in the ring grooves has
been eliminated.
The nominal machining stock allow-
ance on these two parts is 1/32 in. and in
some areas it is even less. Of special note
is that a hole is cored completely through
the larger casting. The portion of the
grooves cast by the core must be in perfect
alignment with that made by the cope shell
or mold. The minor diameter of the core
is 5/16 in. and this diameter is machined
to % in. by the casting user which ob-
viously doesn't allow much of a margin
for casting or machining errors.

The shell mold is being stripped from a fully automatic production shell making
machine. The mold, which can be handled with asbestos, is ready for assembly.
Typical of the many shell-cast parts
now being mass produced is the grey iron
valve housing for automotive power steer-
ing units. The housing has six internal
grooves, four of which have deep exten-
sions. Inasmuch as these grooves must be
clean and accurate, it is practically impos-
sible to produce this casting by any other
method. A resin-bonded or shell core used
in the process is dimensionally accurate
because it is baked or cured in the core
box. Furthermore, it produces a clean and
smooth casting surface because of the in-
herent qualities of the dry resin mix.
These qualities provide a tight compact
core which prohibits iron penetration and
results in a casting free from surface sand
inclusions.
Shell Process Reduces Machining
Operations
Another major advantage of the shell
mold process is the reduction in the num-
ber of machining operations required to
complete a part.
An example is a trigger housing or
guard for the Browning automatic rifle
now in production. These castings are
produced in ArmaSteel-GM 85M (pearl-
itic malleable iron) in the 197 to 241
Brinell hardness range. The dimensional
tolerance and surface finish characteristics
obtainable in making this part by the
shell mold process eliminate the need for
machining all except the wear and con-
tact surfaces.
Most of the operations eliminated were
those performed by profile milling. Al-
though costly, these operations were neces-
sary to facilitate handling of the gun. As
a matter of fact, in this case shell castings
provide an aesthetic appeal in that the
blending contours can be much more
pleasing to the eye and touch than are
those obtainable by machining, except at
impractical expense. The steel forging
used for producing this part prior to
World War II weighed 2% lb., while
the ArmaSteel green sand casting used
during this emergency weighed 2.1 lb.
The current shell casting weighs only
1.12 lb. as shipped from the foundry.
The recent development of a constant-
friction shock absorber for Army tanks
also takes advantage of the reduced-ma-
chining feature of the process for the
manufacture of two of its components.
This shock absorber contains a three-piece
shoe faced with a special brake lining.
Each shoe casting has three angular flats
on the pads at the center of the casting
which must be cast smoothly and accurate-
ly, inasmuch as they are functionally im-
portant. It would be exceedingly difficult
and costly to machine the interior of this
part even though the shoe is cut into three
segments after the outside diameter has
been turned. Outside of a coining opera-
tion, no other machine work is necessary
on the interior of the shell casting. Two
important contributions of the shell mold
process to this part are the ability to mold
it without the use of cores and the ability
to draw the pattern with a minimum of
draft on the sidewalls. In regard to draft,
shell molding enables the holding of a
draft of less than one-half degree.
The other shell-molded shock absorber
part is the wedge ring. Two of these cast-
ings are used per shock absorber, being
assembled inside the three shoe segments.
Coining the flats plus drilling and ream
ing a hole through the center represent
the only machining operations performed
on the wedge-ring castings.
Another example of reduction of ma-
chining by making castings by the shell
mold process is a grey-iron automotive
harmonic balancer weight. For years, this
part had been made from a heavy sand
casting which necessitated machining on
all surfaces. With shell molding even the
holes are cast and the only surface which
requires machining is the mounting face.
Some of the obvious advantages to the
casting user in this case are:
• Less material to purchase
• Lower freight charges
• Less stock to remove in machining
• Lower capital outlay for machine
tools
• Lower cutting-tool expense
• Less floor space required in the
machine shop.
In general, these advantages apply to
most shell-molded parts.
Shell Process Provides Belter Dimensional
Control
Even where machining is necessary, a
shell casting offers an advantage in re-
ducing the amount of stock to be remov-
ed. In other words, overall casting ac-
curacy permits the use of a minimum of
stock. This, of course, eliminates the need
for roughing cuts on most surfaces.
An example is a small, grey-iron piston
used for domestic refrigeration. The
finished piece weighs 0.19 lb. and is made
from a 0.40 lb. permanent-mold casting
which requires turning operations on the

G-E Computer, Astronomers Combine
Efforts to Locate "Lost" Planets
"Lost" planets are having a tough time
staying that way when astronomers com-
bine a telescope and the "electronic brain"
to locate them.
This time-saving combination was em-
ployed recently when Dr. Paul Herget,
Director of the Cincinnati Observatory,
rediscovered the planet Athalia, lost for
50 years, by using the General Electric
Company's giant IBM 701 computer to
figure its orbit.
The planet, originally discovered photo-
graphically at the Heidelberg Observatory
in Germany on Sept. 20, 1903, was ob-
served again on Sept. 29, Oct. 13 and 19.
It was given the number 515 and the
name Athalia.
The orbit was computed for this planet
from the observations in the usual man-
ner, but the planet was not photographed
again until 1948 when Indiana University
took about 2,000 plates of minor planets.
While checking these plates recently to
determine the orbits of the planets, Dr.
Herget solved the astronomical problems
on the 701 computer which G.E.'s Air-
craft Gas Turbine Division at Cincinnati,
Ohio, normally uses for research and en-
gineering purposes.
By using the machine, it was possible
to calculate the planet's orbit in just one
minute compared to weeks of hard work
with a desk calculator.
The orbit path shown by the "electronic
brain" revealed that the recent Indiana
observations could be brought into full
agreement with the old observations of
Athalia at Heidelberg in 1903.
Dr. Herbert R. J. Grosch, who man-
ages the analytical and computing services
at the General Electric Company's Air-
craft Gas Turbine Division plant here, re-
calls that when he "rediscovered" Jupi-
ter's eighth satellite in 1941 while work-
ing on his doctor's degree at the Univer-
sity of Michigan, it took him over 1,000-
man-hours of work to get the same cal-
culations which he could now obtain in
just one minute by using the "electronic
brain."
Inco's Open Pit Is One of Canada's
Most Spectacular Mining Activities
The Sudbury District of Ontario is
probably best known as the heart of Can-
ada's nickel industry. From this area,
about 300 miles north of Lake Erie, comes
more nickel than the rest of the world
combined, as well as large quantities of
copper, platinum metals and other ele-
ments. Many mines have contributed to
Sudbury's foremost position as a nickel
producer, but none has the sweeping scale
and scope of the Frood-Stobie Open Pit
of The International Nickel Company of
Canada, Limited.
The Open Pit is part of the great
Frood-Stobie ore body, the largest single
nickel ore body ever discovered. Ten
thousand feet long and more than 4,000
feet deep, this wide column has enormous
tonnages of ore still waiting to be mined
despite the millions of tons already pro-
duced. The Frood-Stobie ore body was
already being mined by underground
methods when surface operations began
and it has been worked upward and
downward from the 2,800-foot level.
During World War II the Open Pit
alone supplied more than 40 per cent of
the Allies' nickel requirements. Mined in
steps or "benches," the huge excavation
is more than 500 feet deep, and measures
about 6,300 feet at its greatest length
and 1,400 feet at its widest. Although the
crushing plant is actually only about 1,000
feet from the place on the pit floor where
the shovels are working, the trucks used
to transport ore must travel more than a
mile over a road winding upward around
the inside of the pit walls before they
reach the plant on the surface.
The southern section of the vast Open
Pit has given over to underground min-
ing, which at this point now extends be-
low the 2,800-foot level, but surface op-
erations continue in the central and
southern sections. It is in the central sec-
tion where the Open Pit reaches its
maximum width of 1,400 feet and where
also it will achieve the maximum depth
by surface mining—now planned for
580 feet below surface level. This has
been determined to be the economical
limit for surface operations. From here
the ore body will be mined from under-
ground.
Meantime, drilling rigs continue to
pound nine-inch holes 60 feet down into
the ore body. Blasting power is placed in
the set of holes and the charge is fired.
About 12,000 tons of ore are shattered
with each blast. Then huge 170-ton elec-
tric shovels, with a bucket capacity of
41/^ cubic yards, scoop up the ore and
dump it into the 30-ton diesel truck for
transportation to the crusher on the sur-
face. Bulldozers and graders are continu-
ally- engaged maintaining the bottom of
the pit and the roads as part of an orderly
program of "good housekeeping."
The time is approaching when the
famous Frood-Stobie ore body will be
mined exclusively by underground meth-
ods. But the yawning Open Pit, standing
astride the largest body of nickel ore the
world has known, will be remembered as
one of the most spectacular activities in
Canadian mining history long after its
walls cease to echo to the familiar sounds
of surface operations.

Highly important also are the facts that these ball bearings

Julian Frederick is at present directing a
group investigating the transmission of
sound waves in shallow water. The ex-
perimental portion of this research is car-
ried out in a testing tank at Willow Run
on a small scale model basis. An under-
water sound velocity meter was recently
developed in the Electrical Engineering
Department to measure the speed of
sound waves at different depths in the
ocean. The Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution cooperated in the testing of
this instrument in the Atlantic.
As a student in the Engineering College
can you take courses in acoustics? The an-
swer is yes. If you are interested in vi-
bration and structure borne sound, sub-
jects closely related to acoustics, you will
find courses in the Engineering Mechanics
Department. The Electrical Engineering
Department offers a course in electro-
acoustics, and a sound laboratory has re-
cently been added to the program to
demonstrate acoustical measurements. Sub-
jects covered are microphones, loudspeak-
ers, radiation and propagation of sound,
hearing and ultrasonics. Several recent
doctoral thesis topics in Electrical Engi-
neering have been on acoustics. The phys-
icist today is concentrating more of his
time on such subjects as atomic and solid
state physics, and there is a national trend
to move acoustics more into the field of
engineering. The close connection be-
tween engineering and noise reduction is
just one example of why engineers are
becoming more interested in acoustics.
New developments in methods for locat-
ing faults in metals by sound waves, the
use of sonics in medicine for therapy or
tumor location, the application of ultra-
sonics to cleaning or even the machining
of very hard metals; these are opportuni-
ties for engineers. Like the physics book
with Williams' half dollar, there is money
in acoustics too.

To help develop Sta-Clean for Standard Furnace Oil, the testing apparatus
shown here was constructed. Running an experiment on the improved oil
is Dr. Jack A. Williams, a chemist at Standard Oil's Whiting laboratories.
HOW TO SOLVE A BURNING PROBLEM!
Scientists in Standard Oil laboratories work with
the stimulating knowledge that practical and val-
uable results will be obtained from their discoveries.
A recent achievement of Standard Oil scientists is
now benefiting hundreds of thousands of Standard
Furnace Oil users throughout the Midwest.
In 1952 our research people undertook the prob-
lem of finding a method to eliminate oil burner fail-
ure or inefficiency arising from clogged filters and
burner nozzles.
After months of painstaking laboratory work and
many more months of thorough field testing through-
out an entire heating season, Standard Oil scientists
perfected a new, efficient additive—Sta-Clean.
Blended into our furnace oil, the new additive acts
as a detergent, sludge inhibitor and rust stopper—
all in one. Sta-Clean assures clean oil filters and
nozzles—a dramatic contribution to efficient and
economical heating.
The development of this remarkable new additive
is further proof of the progress possible when scien-
tists are given time and equipment to explore and
develop thoroughly their ideas. Young scientists
find such an atmosphere inspiring.

(Conclusion)
Synopsis
During the later stages of World War
II, and the beginnings of the Cold War,
intensive research on ground to ground
guided missiles had been conducted by
the government. When the unexpected
reversals in Eudope came, coupled with
the treachery in Yugoslavia, the "free"
world panicked and fell into a mad arma-
ment race. The Western Faction, a power-
ful coalition in the United Nations, see-
ing as their "ace" a fleet of "super" mis-
siles, ordered research on this to be ac-
celerated.
The first work was done in the Pacific
and lated moved to the American Desert.
There a fantastic combination of computer
and controller sent rockets whistling out
to targets in the Pacific. This machine,
known as the DOG, guided the missile
through a series of relay stations, and set
the trigger in its warhead when it was
out over the ocean.
A new type of rocket was now being
pushed into production, on orders from
the Western Faction. It was a clean,
beautiful ship with a long, slendering tip.
In the tip smuggled a million tons of
death. The last few of its type had not
made successful flights. There was a flaw
somewhere. "Sabotage" was hinted at,
and now out in the Main Control Room,
in the American Desert, the flight of the
Bumble Bee had been started. It rose and
went off very high, leveled off, and
headed ... in the wrong direction. A blue
light on the DOG indicates that the war-
head is dead, but as the rocket takes off
someone notices the light is off!
Out on the desert, in the Main Con-
trol Room, were five men—Security held
the pistol on Griffin. Griffin sat in the
corner, alternately laughing like a child
and half-taunting, half-pleading with the
grim little man before him.
'Shut up."
"But Security—let's be fair about this.
I didn't do anything. I wouldn't do any-
thing. Just because that silly rocket went
off the wrong way, you—" Griffin went
off into another spasm, like an idiot.
"GRIFFIN! Laugh once more—it'll be
your last laugh."
Tiny walked over. "He's been under a
lot of strain—I know he hasn't done
anything."
"Do you know—I mean really?"
by CECIL MELUN, '58 E
"Well—No—but he's been under a
hell of a strain."
"So?—So'v I—So's everybody. So
what?"
"Yeh I know but I mean him
laughing about this—he wouldn't do that
if he was normal."
"That'll be my worry Tiny."
Link turned from the phone. "The
engineering team will be here right
away."
Socrates swung around. "They better
hurry. We don't have any relay stations
in Mexico. They better hurry damn fast."
Tiny awoke from some deep thinking.
"Say Link, there's something I don't
understand here—correct me now if I
go off—but that blue light—it's out—
that means that the bomb has been trig-
gered and is alive—RIGHT?"
'Teah."
"O.K.—now for the bomb to be trig-
gered, there has to be a signal sent thru
the DOG So the DOG is out of contact
with the Bee right now—and we know
that there is no signal being sent thru
to trigger it. So—-"
"Yeh Tiny." Link nodded over at
Griffin.
"So somebody must have triggered it
before—is that it Link?"
Link nodded over at Griffin again.
"But suppose the head is dead,—sup-
pose there's just a circuit out in the DOG
somewhere, or maybe the light is burnt
out—or maybe a fuse blew."
"The engineering team is coming—
they'll check it over."
The engine team came. Young men, a
loud raucous group, but efficient. They
pushed black boxes on wheels around
the DOG, stopping here and there to
pull out a long black cable from the box,
plug it into the DOG, and watch little
needles jump back and forth. It took
them seven minutes.
Link looked urgent. "What's the ver-
dict?"
"Everything checks thru O.K.—as far
as we're concerned. You guys just don't
know how to run your own machine. It
appears as tho you're still in contact with
your rocket too."
"The blue light," said Link, "did you
check that circuit thru?"
"Yes—everything. That blue light will
go on if it's supposed to.—Say,—looks
like you fellows have got yourself in a
pretty pickle this time.
Link didn't hear. He was over with
Socrates. "Yes—we're still in contact. She
should respond—"
"Link"—Socrates was quietly exas-
perated—"Link—I've been punching
these controls silly—nothing happens.
"Try again—maybe it's O.K. now."
Socrates went thru the procedure once
again. He set and reset the switches be-
fore him. The slow moving dot on the
gridscreen did not falter.
Socrates hand fastened on the toggle
that pulled the teeth from the bomb. He
jerked it hard.
The blue light did not go on.
Link stared hard at Griffin.
Griffin squirmed and giggled.
It was Tiny who broke the silence.
"Well—now what do we do."
It was Link who answered. "Nothing—
I'm afraid. There isn't a bloody damned
thing that we can do. It's out of our
hands. It's up to the Defense Department
now. They're going to have to bring the
Bee down somewhere. Where there's
no people."
"Yeh—like in Mexico."
Security turned, looking interested
"Say Link—what do you suppose it is—
what do you think is wrong?"
Griffin grew suddently sane. "That's an
odd question coming from one who is
ready to kill a guy for sabotaging the
damn thing."
Security ignored this. "I mean, sup-
pose that it wasn't tampered with—if the
DOG is still in contact with the rocket,
why doesn't the rocket respond?"
"I don't know—I just got thru saying
that I didn't know—if I knew I might
know how to fix it."
Security continued. "That is a pretty
complicated piece of machinery isn't it?
It can outperform thousands of people—
what I mean is, do you suppose that it
could be doing what it wants to do—I
mean, not that it knows what it wants to
do, but it's just giving the orders it
wants?"
"Are you talking about the DOG or
the rocket?"
"Both—and what I mean is—"
"Oh stow that! A machine can't think.
All these damn ignorant people that think
that machines are going to turn on us and

destroy us all. Machines can't put out anymore than people put
in them."
Tiny stirred, If I recall, there were about a million and a
half man hours of thought PUT into that gizmo. I wouldn't
want to be bucking that all at once."
The Bumble Bee flew over the waters of the Gulf of Mexico.
It's course had not been erratic, but it had not been like the
crow flies either. It had started out high and fast, heading to
the southwest, writing a long slow curve in the sky, much like
half of a hyperbola. It approached the vertex of the hyperbola,
still gaining altitude but losing speed. Imperceptibly it had
turned, curving back towards the southwestern U. S., and
coming down in a long glide, glowing a dull red from increased
speed. And now it was 30,000 feet over the Gulf of Mexico,
heading at New Orleans.
Capt. Janowisc stared into the mirror at his eyes.Gray eyes
they were. "Gold steel-grey eyes that could look right thru you,"
said the press. Janowisc thought they were the softest pair of
grey eyes he'd seen. Funny what landed a man a job. I little
better than 20-10 vision, brains, guts, and quick hands. Janowisc
laughed. Yeah that's all it took. And he was their top man.
And he was paid fabulous sums for taking each new monster
up in the sky and torturing it to near death and bringing it
down. And now he had to take one of those monsters up and
bring down some damn fool runaway rocket before the rocket
came down itself. He looked in the mirror again, and strode
out to his ship.
"All set Capt."

New Application of Refrigeration
Phillips Chemical Company's new plant near Big Spring, Texas, is the
first in the country to produce 98% pure para-xylene (used in the
manufacture of a synthetic fiber) in commercial quantities.
The new, revolutionary process, patented by Phillips, involves contin-
uous fractional crystallization. The heart of the system is a Frick
"cascade" low-temperature refrigerating plant that FREEZES OUT
para-xylene crystals.
Whether your process is in the idea, development or production stage—

ing, operated over 30 yearstoffers a career in a growing industry.
"Yes, I guess so."
"You sound pretty enthused."
"Just tired—tired of people I think.-"
"You'll wake up upstairs—now—yer all set?—you got the
brief?"
"Yeah—get to the rocket as soon as possible, and blow it up
in midair—that's all."
"And try and set off the warhead when you get it—and
then get the hell out of there."
Janowisc looked at the two needles hanging under the
wings—the little needles that would do the job if he could get
close enough. "I'll bring that thing down, or die trying."
"Oh—you don't have to try that hard—remember—we have
to have this plane back."
"Yeah."' —
Realization hit Janowisc hard as he saw the glowing rocket
hurtling thru the blue. It was going fast. Too damn fast. Some-
body had made a mistake, and now he was out of position. He
pulled his silver monster up hard, clawing after the Bee. Speed,
he needed speed. He'd have to dive. It was the only way he
could hope to catch it.
Up and up he went, the plane straining and trembling. He
nosed down. Down, faster and faster. It got warm. The ship
shook and a few rivets popped as it ripped thru the barrier.
Janowisc's grey eyes fixed on the sights—the Bee hurtled thru
them. Closer! Closer!—he must get closer. Janowics hesitated.
The Bee was gone.
He cursed, wrenched his monster up—and his soft grey eyes
flickered as he foggily watched the wings slowly—ever so slow-
ly—part company with the plane. It went down in a violent,
intense spin.
The Bee turned and headed upwards again—away from the
land and over the waters.
Out in the desert, a fat man sat and doodled with a pencil.
"Link—the Bee made one hyperbolic run—now it's off on
another—a tighter one.—If it follows a true hyperbolic course—
the way it is now—it's going to come dawn close to Wash-
ington. —
Washington waited. It was ready. The last of the leaders
were being led into the concrete chambers below. The people
had been warned. Some panicked and were blocking the roads.
Around Washington lay a silent circle of missiles, waiting for
the Bee.
The Bee whistled in over the Atlantic, Washington lay ahead.
On the edge of the district, in the slums, a young man walk-
ed. A gray-haired old man sat on the curb, picking at the little
pieces of mud between the cracks in the concrete. The young
man stopped.
"Say old-timer."
The old man stopped picking.
"I work for the Chronicle, and they're conducting an invest—"
The old man smiled. "Yes, I know. They always do."
"I'm sorry—I am. But they are interested in you people in
here. They try to let other people know—"
"IN here, eh son?—Yes, I suppose."
"Well look, would you answer a few questions?"
"Glad to."
"Well—just—"
The Bumble Bee bore on.

J.S." electrical wires and cable:
SABLE TESTING (Part i)
has been indicated in a previous section of this series entitled
3ablc Specifications" that practically every element of insulated
ectrical wires and cables may be covered by some specification
quirements. Numerous tests are, therefore, necessary to determine
ie suitability of such cables for the application for which they are
;signed. These tests may be conducted on (a) the cable elements
jring manufacture, known as preliminary tests, (b) the completed
ibles at the factory, final tests, and (c) after installation. Some of
e preliminary and final tests at the cable factory such as conductor
sistance, high voltage, insulation resistance and corona level are,
;nerally, non-destructive tests and may be conducted on each
itire length of cable manufactured. Other tests, such as insulation
id sheath thickness, physical, aging, moisture, resistance, ozone
■sistance, capacity and power factor, short-time dielectric strength
id cold bending and long-time dielectric strength tests are made on
ion samples selected from a lot of cable.
No. 9 in a series
The following is a genera) description of these tests and their
significance as applied to insulated electrical wires and cables.
Details of the test equipment required and the specification require-
ments are not discussed since they are covered by industry publica-
tions such as those of the American Society for Testing Materials
and the Insulated Power Cable Engineers Association.
FACTORY TESTS
Factory tests are performed for the following purposes: (1) to
determine whether the materials of which the cable is made have
the required quality; (2) to determine whether the manufacturing
processes such as wire drawing, annealing, compound mixing, insu-
lation extrusion and vulcanization have been performed properly;
(3) to detect partial or incipient faults that may have accidentally
failed to be detected in the tests indicated in (2); and (4) to deter-
mine whether the cable meets the customer's specifications.
Tests on Entire Lengths
CONDUCTOR RESISTANCE. Test is made to insure that the conductor
has the required average cross-sectional area and, hence, that its
resistance does not exceed the allowed maximum.
SPARK TESTING. The entire length of insulated conductor is sub-
jected momentarily to a high potential to detect and permit the
repair of imperfections in the insulation that might cause failure
on subsequent voltage and insulation resistance tests.
HIGH VOLTAGE TEST. This test is conducted on each entire length of
insulated cable to detect potential faults or weak spots in the insu-
lation and to insure that the insulation will withstand the minimum
voltage required by the specification for its rated voltage. The mag-
nitude of the test voltage is determined by the type and thickness
of the insulation as shown in the following table for 600 volt cables.
The time of application is one minute for code grade insulation,
and five minutes for the higher grades.

Cables designed for operation at voltages above 5001 are requirec
to withstand a d-c test voltage in addition to the a-c voltage. Thi;
d-c voltage is three times the a-c voltage for ozone-resistant insu-
lations and it is usually applied for 15 minutes.
The high voltage test is made by applying the required voltage
between the conductor and water in which the cable has been im
mersed for at least six hours. When metallic coverings are present
the voltage is applied between the conductor and such coverings
Any failures are repaired and the cable again subjected to th&lt;
voltage.

insulation compounding, since a well-processed compound sh&lt;
give reasonably uniform insulation resistance. Most wire and c
specifications contain minimum requirements for insulation re
ance so that this test determines whether or not the specificatic
complied with.
The resistance of insulations is inversely proportional to the I
perature, that is, it is lower at high temperatures. It is, there!
necessary to note the temperature at which the insulation resist;
is measured and to apply a correction factor to reduce the resist;
to a standard temperature. The insulation resistance varies with
type of insulation, its thickness and the size and length of the i
ductor. The following formula gives the relation between tl
factors.
Insulation Resistance, Megohms — 1000 feet = K log10I£L
Where, D = Diameter over the insulation, inches
d = Diameter over the conductor, inches
K = A Constant for the insulation used
CORONA OR IONIZATION LEVEL. This test determines the vol
at which ionization or corona develops in a length of cable an
usually made only on cable for operation above 4000 volts,
made by applying a gradually increasing a-c voltage between
insulated conductor and water or other ground with an oscillosc
in the circuit. Any air entrapped at the surfaces of the insulatioi
within the insulation will ionize when a sufficiently high voltag
applied resulting in the formation of more active oxygen or ozc
These materials are detrimental to most organic insulations part
larly when such insulations are under physical tension, and I
may cause premature failure of the insulation. This ionizatio
indicated by the appearance of high-frequency oscillations on
charging current trace of the oscilloscope. In actual practice,
voltage at which ionization is extinguished rather than initiate
determined. For long cable life, this extinction voltage should b
least 110 per cent of the rated voltage to ground.
Wire and cable specifications generally require that these t
be made on the completed product. High voltage and insulation
sistance tests are usually also made immediately after the insulal
has been applied and vulcanized. This is general insurance i
cables passing the test will meet the requirements when comple
4SULATION RESISTANCE. The insulation resistance test consists of
pplying a direct voltage of from 125 to 500 volts, usually from a
attery, between the conductor and water in which the cable is
nmersed, or other ground, and measuring the current that flows
irough the insulation after an electrification of one minute. A
uitable galvanometer is generally used for this measurement. From
bis current and the applied voltage, the resistance of the insulation
; calculated and expressed, usually, as megohms (1 million ohms),
"his test is conducted after the voltage tests and, hence, serves to
idicate whether the insulation failed on that test. Insulation resist-
nce also serves to indicate uniformity in processing, particularly

want to have anything to—"
"There's nothing keeping me here
son."
The young man hesitated.—"But why
are you here?—how did you get here?"
The other shrugged—"Thinking too
much—just got to thinking too much and
I drifted here."
"But why are you still here if you can
get out?"—the young man was eager,
insistent.
"Waiting I guess."
The young man brightened. "Waiting
for somebody to clean up the slums—
that's it, isn't it?"
The old man turned and looked full
at the other. It was the look of the wor-
ried master trying to speak to his dog.
He looked down at the concrete again
and spoke quietly. "No, that isn't it. I'm
waiting—waiting for a miracle. I just
think and think about life, and I always
end up figuring that it isn't worth living
unless you're religious.—I'm not relig-
ious. I've tried—but I can't be. I—" The
old man spun up and walked away.
The Bumble Bee neared Washington.
Waiting below were the crews at the
missile stations. The Secretary of Defense
took a last look at the beauty of the Pen-
tagon, and hurried to the basements.
"Wait!" The young man tugged at the
other's sleeve. "Wait. You think I don't
know how you feel—you think I can't
understand, but I do—you think just—
well you think about everything you do
and everybody goes like hell and is driv-
ing all the time—and then they die—

If only he could prove to me someway.
Some sign. Like if God would reach his
hand down and—say, make a big explo-
sion—over there. Over by the Capitol
Buildings. If He could make some sign—
then—"
Washington waited. But the Bumble
Bee didn't come. It suddenly turned, as
if shoved by a giant hand, and headed
out to sea again. By this time the actions
of the rocket were not entirely un familiar.

.. . why they spell a better life for you
A CENTURY AGO, pioneering scientists learned to take
apart water, air, and earth and put them together again in completely different arrangements.
THE RESULT, very often, was a synthetic—a brand new
material that didn't exist in nature, or a more abundant,
more useful version of a nature-made product. Thus,
through the years, synthetic has come to mean 'man-
made and well-made.'
Science has developed nearly half a million synthetic
materials since that time, and millions more are possible.
WHERE DO SYNTHETICS fit into your life? Nearly
everywhere! The aspirin you take for a headache, the
life-saving sulfa drugs and scores of other modern medi-
cines are synthetics. So are today's remarkable plastics,
new textiles, and many paints, dyes, adhesives, and val-
uable chemicals.
AN IMPORTANT PART of the work of the people of
Union Carbide is discovering and producing synthetic
materials that serve you and industry. From natural gas
and oil, alone, they produce nearly 400 chemicals.
Among them are chemicals that are vital to everything
from synthetic rubber to cosmetics... and to the variety
of plastics and resins made by UCC, which are used in
nearly every home and industry today.

creates the need for a 40 per cent increase in our en-
neering staff.
Completion of the five-year program—financed by
General Motors—will give Allison, and Indianapolis,
one of the world's most complete, best equipped, cen-
ters for the development of new, high performance
turbo-prop and turbo-jet aircraft engines for both mili-
tary and commercial use.
As General Motors President Harlow H. Curtice
said in the announcement, "Engines in production
today cannot meet the requirements of the aircraft of
tomorrow where ability to operate at supersonic
speeds, and very high altitudes, will continue to be
demanded from engine builders . . . To design and
build engines with such advanced performance, test
facilities are required which go far beyond the capa-
bilities of equipment in existence today. In recognition
of this need, General Motors will add extensive high
performance test facilities to those already established
and in operation at the Allison Division."
Already a recognized leader in the design, develop-
ment and production of turbo-jet and turbo-prop en-
gines, Allison NOW is in a position to offer even
greater opportunities to the technically-trained, well-
qualified, young graduate who is interested in building
his engineering career with a pace setter in the field.

CLIFFORD LITHERLAND received a B.A. degree from Rice In-
stitute last year, and is now working for a B.S. in Chemical
Engineering. He is Business Manager of "The Rice Engineer,"
and Vice-President of the fifth-year class at Rice. By asking
questions of prospective employers, Cliff is trying to get informa-
tion that will help him make the best use of his training in the
years ahead.
Arthur Mendolia answers:
ARTHUR I. MENDOLIA was graduated from Case
Institute in June 1941 and started work with
the Du Pont Company that same month. In
addition to handling challenging assignments at
work, he also enjoys some interesting hobbies.
Although he makes no claims personally, he's
classed as a minor authority on golf and hi-fi
music. Mr. Mendolia is Assistant Director of
Research for Du Pont's Electrochemicals Dept.

Well, Cliff, I'd say the answer to that question depends
largoly on your own preferences. In a company the size of
Du Pont there are opportunities for growth along either line.
In my own case, I've followed the route of diversification
—and I think you'll find that's the general procedure when
a fellow is interested in administrative work.
For example, after graduation I started work in the re-
search lab at Du Pont's Niagara Falls plant. That was fol-
lowed by two years of process improvement work, and a
stretch as assistant supervisor over one of the plant areas.
Next, I spent a few years in liaison on the design and con-
struction of our first full-scale plant for making nylon inter-
mediates from furfural. Then, I had assignments on "plant
start up," and production supervision before I was given my
present post. I was made Assistant Director of Research for
Du Pont's Electrochemicals Department last August.
You see, variety of assignments means contact with new
men and with constantly changing problems. That keeps
interest alive. It leads to growth, too, because it provides a
broad base of experience for future responsibilities.
On the other hand, some fellows prefer to become special-
ists in a particular field—and Du Pont has many oppor-
tunities for that type of professional growth, too. In our
research, development and design groups we have experts
on distillation, mass transfer, thermodynamics—and most
anything else you'd care to mention in the field of engineer-
ing. These men are respected throughout the whole company
for their technical knowledge.
Whichever route you choose, Cliff—broad or specialized—
you'll find that a job well done leads to satisfaction and ad-
vancement at Du Pont.

navigate planes, guide missiles, poii
ONE of the first gyroscopes on record is credited to
Bohnenberger; the date, 1810. Compared to today's
precision-made gyros, of course, it was in the toy class.
The evolution of the gyro from a novelty to a
definite place of importance in the field of aviation and
our national defense program is worth noting.
The value of a gyro is in direct ratio to its accuracy.
Thus, even if early applications had been apparent, the
gyros of the 19th century could not have met the re-
quirements.
Some of the first practical applications of the gyro
were in instruments for airplanes. And while most
Bendix Gyros today still find their way into commercial
and military airplanes, they also do many other jobs-
help point guns, stabilize aerial photographic platforms,
direct and stabilize radar antennas and many others.
It should be explained that a gyro does not stabi
or control anything directly—except itself.
But its peculiar ability to hold itself fixed, alir
unwaveringly, in any designated position despite
movements of the object to which it is attached, f
vides the gyro's user with a vital requirement—a ft
stable reference point on which to base calculations
corrective actions.

ing. Now a 0.26 lb. shell-mold casting is
proposed which requires only grinding
operations in these same areas.
Another case is an automotive crank-
shaft sprocket formerly made from No.
1117 solid bar stock which was case-
hardened after machining. Although the
performance of the steel piece was con-
sidered to be in a satisfactory range, the
bar stock was very often on the critical
list which presented procurement prob-
lems. As a solution it was decided to
switch to ArmaSteel, which was readily
available. This change improved the wear
characteristics. Flame hardening of the
teeth after machining results in a surface
hardness of Rockwell 55C.
ArmaSteel lends itself to shell mold-
ing of the casting and the stock removal
in machining is only a fraction compared
to that required when steel bar stock was
used. Formerly, it took 1.93 lb. of steel
for each piece while the rough shell cast-
ing weighs 1 lb. Only minor amounts of
turning are required on the shell casting.
The final product as produced from the
shell casting is not only superior to that
produced from steel bar stock but is also
lower in cost.
A third example of the advantages
gained from the shell mold process in
WHY SHELL MOLDING?
(Continued from page 17)
controlling dimensions is a malleable iron
shell casting for artillery shell booster
bodies. This part formerly was made of
brass, frequently a critical item, and the
combination of malleable iron and shell
molding has provided economics without
affecting function and reliability. Exten-
sive tests by military agencies proved that
malleable iron, when cadmium-plated,
was satisfactory. Large quantities of three
different designs of booster castings are
currently being shipped to firms in the
East and Midwest. Although the finished
machine piece is the same in all cases, the
design of the rough castings varies to suit
the type of machine used.
Although the improved casting accu-
racy obtainable in shell castings generally
results in the elimination of some ma-
chining operations, extensive study of the
booster body molding indicated that it
would be more practical to machine it all
over. The automatics and chuckers used
for running brass had sufficient spindles,
and fewer problems with tolerances could
be foreseen. Furthermore, it was obvious
that less trouble would be encountered
in the cadmium plating of the piece.
Green sand castings were considered
for this application but the decision to
use shell castings was based on its several
advantages, such as:
Engineering Journal
The shell mold (left) produces the same number of casting as the green sand mold
(right) although it weighs less than 10 per cent as much. The comparative bulk'
is self evident.
• Lower freight costs
• More accurate chucking
• Less machining stock (for small
pieces such as this, 1/32 in. to 3/64
in. is usually sufficient for cutting
operations, while only about 0.020
in. is required for grinding)
o Cleaner casting surface, which per-
mits higher cutting speeds, higher
production, and lower tool costs.
Conclusion
The parts described in the foregoing
discussion are typical of those now in
production by the shell mold process at
Central Foundry Division. The experi-
ence gained and the progress which has
been recorded indicate that the number
of parts to which this process will be
applied will increase rapidly in the future.
Even now, numerous new parts are going
into production. Although the process
lends itself particularly well to the pro-
duction of smaller castings, size is not
necessarily a limitation.
One limitation of the process is that
volume production is usually a basic
requirement. This is due to the higher
cost of the patterns. These patterns must
be machined all over to fine tolerances
and finishes from close grained material
which has the ability to remain stable at
elevated temperatures. The required ejec-
tor or stripper pins also add to the
pattern cost.
Shell castings generally are slightly
more costly than conventional green sand
castings, mainly because of the phenolic
resin used as a mold binder. Considerable
research work is underway to develop
new and less expensive binders which will
put shell castings in a better competitive
position. Even at the present resin cost,
some castings can be produced currently
at a cost comparable to or lower than
green sand castings. This is particularly
true when cores can be eliminated.
Although the majority of castings pro-
duced today are made by the conventional
or green sand method, continuing im-
provements in shell mold process tech-
niques may eventually revolutionize the
foundry industry. Progress during recent
years rates the process as one of the great-
est foundry developments of modern
times. The time may come when it will
be more economical to produce most
small castings by this method.

Two men in silver talked. Said the
one—"What are our hopes of bringing

that it will repeat its earlier performance,
and make an attack on Quebec."
—And somewhere in N. Y. somebody

Rubber, natural and synthetic, is so elastic
in its applications to daily living that mil-
lions of people ride on it, walk on it, sit
on it, sleep on it—in fact, use it in more than 80,000 differ-
ent products. 1,498,906 tons were consumed in 1953 alone.
This industry's remarkable growth (U.S. consumption of
2,419,700 tons, or 27.7 pounds per person, is forecast for
1960) is largely due to management's wisdom in reinvesting
profits in the tools of production and distribution to en-
courage company growth.
Anyone whose memory goes back 10 years or more can
remember the heroic efforts of the rubber companies by
which they averted a serious wartime rubber shortage which
threatened both military transport, and family transporta-
tion. The phenomenal gains made by the rubber industry in
the last decade have met civilian demands and have provided
an emergency stockpile as well.
And in this history of rubber research, development and
growth, steam has made—and is making—a basic contribu-
tion. Without steam and its teammate power, many of the
accomplishments of rubber would have been more difficult,
impracticable or even impossible to attain.
B&amp;W, through its own vast program of research and
development, coupled with boiler building experience dating
back almost a century, has made major contributions of its
own to the science of steam generation for processing, power
and heat—and through them to the modern-day marvels of
rubber.

Much experimental and development
work has gone into the design and manu-
facture of the core. Before assembling it,
samples of the materials used were test-
ed in existing reactors to study their ra-
diation and corrosion resistance. (3)
Another new metal, hafnium, was also
employed in the construction of the
Nautilus' power plant. The control
rods that vary the amount of available
neutrons and control the reactivity, are
made of this metal. The very fact that
hafnium is a good neutron absorber, a
property that makes it a suitable material
for control rods, also causes the metal to
be transmuted gradually into isotopes of
higher order that are not such good ab-
sorbers of neutrons. This fact had to be
taken into consideration when designing
the rods, to assure that they will perform
adequately throughout the life of the re-
actor. (3)
Water of extreme purity is pumped in
a closed system of pipes through the core
of the reactor and also through a heat
exchanger. One main and several smaller
auxiliary systems remove heat from the
core and induce it through the heat ex-
changer into a secondary system of pipes
which delivers it to the two main turbines
driving the twin propellers, as well as to
other smaller devices such as a turbo-
electric generator producing power for
the ship's needs.
The primary coolant is maintained
under great pressure to prevent it from
turning into steam at the extremely high
temperatures to which it is subjected as it
passes through the core. It cannot be used
directly to drive the turbines because of
its intense radioactivity. For the same
reason, extraordinary care had to be
given to the fabricating of the piping and
pumps that contain the primary coolant
to insure that not even the slightest leak-
age occurs. A leakage of only a few cubic
centimeters would contaminate the sur-
roundings to such an extent as to make
the area uninhabitable. (3)
A rather unique type of water pump
has been employed in the main and auxil-
iary primary cooling systems. The motor
that drives the pump, as well as the pump
itself, is enclosed in a watertight stainless
steel jacket. The hot water fills every
space within the jacket and provides the
only lubrication to the parts. This ar-
rangement eliminates any openings in
the jacket for shafts that would be ex-
tremely difficult to seal. The only open-
ings are where electric conductors have
to enter the pump. Resistance to severe
shock is also an essential requirement of
the primary pumps. (4)
The heat exchanger is actually a special-
ized type of steam boiler. The secondary
pipe system is in two separate sections
for the port and starboard steam plants.
Because of the high pressure to which
steam must be subjected in a submarine,
to contain the sea water when submerged
the condensers, piping, and pumps for all
units become special problems when com-
pared with the low pressure steam sys-
tems of land-based and other shipboard
steam plants. (3)
Shielding. One essential feature for al-
most any nuclear device is adequate
shielding to protect the personnel who
have to work with the apparatus. Shield-
ing usually presents a problem—a prob-
lem that becomes even more difficult in a
submarine. For one thing, it must be as
compact as possible to fit into a specified
space. Secondly, any penetrations of pipes,
shafts, or cables "must be watertight and
airtight to prevent leak-through of radio-
active airborne particles and they also
must be arranged to attenuate properly
any radiation leakage through them." (3)
Third, the shield must be arranged so as
to facilitate accessibility to any part of the
equipment for maintenance purposes. All
these problems were solved successfully
as far as can be told now, and regarding
the effectiveness of the shielding, it can
be said that the average crew member re-
ceives more radiation during his life-
time from cosmic rays, routine X-rays of
the chest and teeth, television screens and
luminescent dials, than he would during
a cruise in the Nautilus lasting the
life of the reactor.
Emergency power source. Aside from
the nuclear power plant, for emergency
operation the Nautilus is also provid-
ed with an electric motor drive that can
be operated both by a battery and a diesel
generator. (3)
Sea trials. At the present time the USS
Nautilus is undergoing a thorough
testing of every operational feature of the
vessel. Beside the power plant all other
equipment will be checked: electrical,
communications, hydraulics, electronics,
steering, etc. After the tests are complet-
ed, and any deficiencies corrected by the
builder, she will undergo a similar series
of tests from the Navy Board of Inspec-
tion and Survey. Only then will the USS
NAUTILUS be officially accepted by the
Navy. (/)

This picture
shows how RCA
helps small
manufacturers
grow
Today the inter-dependence between
manufacturer and supplier is stronger
than ever in the history of American
business. For in the challenging new-
age of electronics, hundreds upon hun-
dreds of component parts are needed
in the manufacture of new products.
For example, the superb new RCA
Victor 21-inch color TV set shown here
contains 2,070 parts. These are made
by 600 different suppliers, most of
whom are small businesses.
Indeed, more than three-quarters of
all RCA suppliers are small business
firms that receive nearly one-half of
RCA's purchasing dollars. They, in
turn, have their suppliers of raw mate-
rials. Thus through a long line of co-
operative effort, employment is pro-
vided for countless people in many
fields—and an entire economy benefits.
RCA salutes its full roster of 7,500
suppliers, located in 43 states, for their
inventiveness and resourcefulness that
contribute so much to the quality
and performance of its products. With
these firms at our side, RCA continues
to march forward, creating new and bet-

Call a cab! Emma ran to the window.
People. A flood of people. She threw the
window open. Noise came to her. She ran
to the china closet. Hurry Emma,
HURRY. Emma grabbed the bottle of
Haig &amp; Haig that her husband had left
on his last Xmas—and father's old alarm

It came low—now over the land, past
the buildings, and down. The long, slen-

plunged downward at a little pansy bed
in front of the U. N. building.
And nothing happened.
Out in the desert, a group of men read

More Strength for Paper
A new impregnation method produces
a paper which retains 90 per cent of its
tensile strength after soaking in water.
The impregnated paper also has more
than ten times the abrasion resistance pro-
vided by ordinary impregnation tech-
niques.
Radar on Windshields
Interceptor aircraft eventually may have
radar information displayed directly on
the cockpit windshield, according to Avia-
tion Week. An electrical firm has develop-
ed transparent phosphors which, in com-
bination with flat picture tube develop-
ments now in progress, may permit radar
images on windshields instead of on
special screens.
Light Noise
Instead of checking the light output
of the 2000-watt light bulb, General Elec-
tric illuminating engineer Richard Blount
makes a laboratory measurement of its
noise level. To help TV and movie pro-
ducers improve sound quality, G. E. has
developed a line of noise-free high-wat-
tage incandescent lamps for studio use.

The Ramo-Wooldridge Corporation
The Ramo-Wooldridge Corporation (except for the
specialized activities of our subsidiary, Pacific Semicon-
ductors, Incorporated) is engaged primarily in develop-
ing—and will soon start to manufacture—systems rather
than components. For military customers our weapons
systems responsibilities are in the fields of guided mis-
siles, fire control, communications, and computers. Our
non-military systems activities are in the general area of
automation and data-processing.
Emphasis on systems development has consequences
that profoundly affect all aspects of an organization. First,
it demands an unusual variety of scientific and engineer-
ing talent. A single systems development project often re-
quires concurrent solutions of challenging problems in
the fields of electronics, aerodynamics, propulsion, ran-
dom phenomena, structures, and analytic mechanics.
In addition, the purely technical aspects of a systems
problem are often associated with equally important non-
technical problems of operational, tactical, or human
relations character.
Therefore, competent systems development requires
that a company contain an unusually large proportion
of mature, experienced scientists and engineers who have
a wide range of technical understanding and an unusual
breadth of judgment. Further, all aspects of company
operations must be designed so as to maximize the effec-
tiveness of these key men, not only in the conduct of
development work but in the choice of projects as well.
At Ramo-Wooldridge we are engaged in building such
a company. Today our staff of professional scientists and
engineers comprises 40% of the entire organization. 01
these men, 40% possess Ph.D. degrees and another 30S3
possess M.S. degrees. The average experience of thi:
group, past the B. S. degree, is more than eleven yean.
We believe the continuing rapid growth of our pro-
fessional staff is due, in part, to the desire of scientist:
and engineers to associate with a large group of their
contemporaries possessing a wide variety of specialties
and backgrounds. It is also an indication that such pro-
fessional men feel that the Ramo-Wooldridge approach
to systems development is an appropriate one.
We plan to continue to maintain the environmental
and organizational conditions that scientists and engi-
neers find conducive to effective systems development.
It is on these factors that we base our expectation of
considerable further company growth.

"Most parents and teachers never think
of suggesting engineering as a career for
a girl, even though she may have shown
mathematical, scientific or mechanical ap-
titudes," Miss Elliott said.
"Although America has been battling
an engineering shortage ever since the
start of World War II," she said, "al-
most nothing has been done to develop
the largest single source of new engineer-
ing talent—women!"
She proposed that manufacturers begin
immediately a search for talented female
college graduates, commenting, "Industry
is already scraping the bottom of the bar-
rel to get male engineers, but the vast
majority of college women have never
been screened for engineering talent."
She disclosed that only three of every
1,000 women in industry are in engineer-
ing jobs, approximately 1,500 for the
entire nation.
Qualified women engineers, she said,
can find good-paying jobs in aircraft re-
search and development, design work,
(Continued from page 20)
stress and aerodynamic engineering, math-
ematical analysis and related fields.
"Women who are qualified can expect
the same salaries as men," she said, "and
some firms and foundations (including
the Lockheed Leadership Fund) offer
engineering scholarships to both boys
and girls."
Miss Elliott, who lives in Cartersville,
Ga., was graduated from the Georgia
State College for Women with a B.S. de-
gree and enrolled for postgraduate work
at the evening engineering school of the
Georgia Institute of Technology. She
specialized in higher mathematics, stress
analysis and engineering drawing. She
joined Lockheed's engineering branch in
1951.
The most critical year facing U. S. in-
dustry is 1955, she disclosed, when only
10,000 engineers will graduate to fill
30,000 new engineering jobs—only one-
third of the engineers needed. Besides this
severe current shortage, which has
brought urgent national appeals from
America's top defense leaders, there is a
past backlog of 40,000 unfilled jobs for
experienced engineers in industry.
Referring to her own job, she com-
mented, "Let's face it, a certain amount
of glamous exists because you can crawl
over, under and through an airplane and
come out still being a woman!" She add-
ed, however, that "many engineering jobs
consist solely of desk work . . . The
course of study (for them) is not diffi-
cult, if you are mechanically or techni-
cally inclined . . . and if you are willing
to work. . . ."
She urged that guidance counselors, in-
dustry, parents, teachers and other youth
leaders join in informing girls in high
school of the attractive careers open in
various engineering occupations.
The little boy wanted $100 so badly he
decided to pray for it. He prayed for
several weeks, with no results: so he
wrote a letter to God. The post office
finally forwarded the letter to the White
House. The late President Roosevelt
chuckled and ordered $5 sent to the boy.
The lad, delighted that his prayers had
been answered in part at least, wrote a
thank-you to God, but added this P.S.:
"I notice you routed letter through Wash-
ington and as usual those bureaucrats de-
ducted 95 per cent."

Physicists have a little humorous puzzle
which asks: How can you prove that the
temperature of Hell is uniform? The an-
swer is that if the temperature were not
the same at every point then some phy-
sicist in Hell (it is always conceded that
there will be plenty of physicists available
there) would set up a heat engine which
would use this difference of temperature
as a means of making energy available.
This physicist would then use this energy
to run a refrigerating device which would
cool down some place in Hell until it was
at a comfortable temperature. But it is
contradictory to the basic notion of Hell
for any spot in it to be comfortable. Thus
one concludes, by a classical reductio ad
absurdum that the assumed difference in
temperature can't exist. Hell is at a
uniform temperature.

How to increase gear life in a scraper
When this 13 cubic yard scraper, fully loaded,
travels at 2 5 MPH over rough terrain, the
gears in the differential, engine shaft and
pinion get a workout. Realizing this, the
engineers specified Timken6 bearings for
these vital applications. The tapered con-
struction of Timken bearings lets them take
radial and thrust loads in any combination.
Gears are held rigidly in place. Perfect
tooth-mesh is maintained. Gears last longer.
o
How TIMKEN® bearings hold
gear shafts rigid
The line contact between rollers and races of Timken
bearings gives shafts rigid support over a wide area.
Shaft deflection is minimized. And the tapered design of
Timken bearings permits them to be set up with the most
desirable amount of end play or preload that gives the
best performance.

HOW PROPER DESIGN
CAN LOWER COSTS
• When you design properly for steel
construction, your products will always
cost less to manufacture. Because steel is
two to three times stronger than cast
iron, and 2Vi times as rigid, fewer pounds
of metal are needed. Also, each pound
of material costs a third as much.
Here, for example, is a base for a ma-
chine tool. As a casting it would cost
$875 to build, weigh 4900 lbs. By prop-
er design in steel, it costs only $536.
Although it weighs 2400 pounds less,
the steel design is actually 45% more
rigid to hold important alignment of
the bed ways.

A bear left its den and went due south
in a straight line for one mile. Then it
made a 90-degree turn to the left and
walked another mile in a straight line.
Twice more it made 90-degree turns to
the left and walked a mile in a straight
line, thus returning to its den. On reach-
ing this starting point, the bear was fac-
ing south. What was the color of the
bear.
Answer
If the bear is headed south on reach-
ing his den, and left it in a due south
line, his den must be on the North Pole
since the last leg of the trip was at right
angles to the first leg. At the North Pole
every direction in which the bear faces is
due south. The bear must be a polar bear
and must be white.
Eight men entered a recent tennis
tournament at Hillcrest. The tournament
was played in 3 consecutive days, one
round per day, and happily no match was
defaulted. The first and second round
matches were stipulated to be 2 sets out
of 3, while the final match was 3 sets
out of 5. A spectator who was present on
all 3 days reported the following facts:
1. Eggleston never met Haverford.
2. Before play began, Gormley re-
marked to Bancroft, "I see that we meet
in the finals."
3. Chadwick won a set at love but lost
his first match.
4. Altogether 140 games were played,
of which the losers won 43.
5. When the pairings were posted,
Abercrombie said to Devereaux, "Do you
concede, or do you want to play it out?"
6. On the second day, the first-round
losers played bridge, and the same table
gathered on the third with Eggleston in
place of Abercrombie.
7. Bancroft won 9 games.
8. Franklin won 37 games.
9- The first score of the tournament
was a service ace by Gormley, at which
Eggleston shouted, "Hey, I'm not over
there!"
Who won the tournament? Whom did
he beat and by what score?
Answer
The minimum number of sets that
could have decided the tournament was
15, totaling 90 games for the winners.
The winners actually took 97 games (4).
One extra set was played in the first
round (3), leaving 1 game to be ac-
counted for. One set in the whole tourn-
ament must have reached 5-alI and must
have been won at 7-5.
Bancroft lost his first match by 6-4 and
7-5 (7). Franklin reached the final, where
he lost (8). Since he won the unique
7-5 set, his first round opponent was Ban-
croft.
Other first-round pairings were Aber-
crombie vs. Devereaux (5 ), and Gormley
vs. Eggleston (9). The remaining two en-
trants must have been paired: Haverford
vs. Chadwick.
The winners in the first round were
Haverford (3), Franklin (8), Eggleston
and Devereaux (6). In the second round
Eggleston did not meet Haverford (1),
nor did he meet Franklin, for Franklin vs.
Bancroft and Eggleston vs. Gormley were
in different halves of the original bracket
(2). Therefore Eggleston met Devereaux
and Haverford met Franklin. The win-
ners were Devereaux (6) and Franklin
(8). Devereaux won the final from Frank-
lin by 6-4, -4, 6-4 (8).

speaks from experience when he says ...
There's plenty of chance for advancement
at U. S. Steel for today's engineer."
Immediately following his graduation
as a B. S. in Metallurgical Engineer-
ing, Richard Crowell was recruited by
the chief metallurgist of U.S. Steel's
Clairton works. By 1951 he received
his third promotion to Engineer-Op-
erating Practices in the Open Hearth
Division at Clairton. Recently he had
his fifth promotion to his current posi-
tion as Assistant Superintendent of
Clairton's Open Hearth Department.
His responsibilities now include as-
sisting in co-ordinating all Open
Hearth Operations and incoming ma-
terials as well as improvement of
methods.
Mr. Crowell knows from his own ex-
perience that there are . . . "unlimited
opportunities for the young engineer
who will apply himself and accept the
challenge of this great industry."
U.S. Steel's well-planned training
programs offer men a chance to work
in varied fields of engineering. Training
plans of this sort make it possible for
the young graduate to familiarize him-
self with many fields before devoting
himself to one in particular.
The steel industry today offers a far
more interesting career to men like
Richard Crowell because of its un-
limited possibilities for success.
If you are interested in a challenging
and rewarding career with United
States Steel and feel that you can
qualify, you can obtain further details

SLIDING DOWN THE WAYS at Groton, Conn., goes the USS Nautilus,
newest and fastest member of our underseas fleet. During welding,
Worthington heavy-duty turning rolls rotated the hull sections.
How the world's first atomic sub was welded
Welding the hull of the USS Nautilus, world's first
atomic submarine, presented a tough problem.
Submerged-arc automatic welding seemed to be ideal
for the job. Question was—could you rotate the hull
sections of the Nautilus to take advantage of this fast,
high-quality welding method?
Worthington's answer to General Dynamics Corpo-
ration's Electric Boat Division, builder of the Nautilus,
was the largest turning roll ever built.
The result? Welding of the Nautilus hull was accom-
plished in record-breaking time — and cost less than
originally estimated. Unchanged, the Worthington roll
set-up is also being used in the construction of the
nation's second atomic sub, the USS Sea Wolf.
Turning rolls for submarines aren't all that Worth-
ington makes. The long list of Worthington-designed,
Worthington-built equipment includes air conditioning
units, construction machinery, compressors, Diesel en-
gines, steam power equipment and, of course, pumps
of all kinds. For the complete story of how you can fit
into the Worthington picture, write F. F. Thompson,
Manager, Personnel and Training, Worthington Cor-
poration, Harrison, New Jersey. You may be glad
you did.

To Physicists and Engineers:
The new science of guided missiles is contributing
importantly to changing man's concept of the Planet
Earth in terms of time and space.
Continents will be only minutes apart in the foresee-
able future. The upper atmosphere is now being
effectively explored. To the missile systems
scientist, there is no such thing as a remote area of
this planet.
Guided missile technology is also significantly affect-
ing other areas of scientific endeavor. The impact of
nuclear science upon guided missiles alone promises
major achievement. Present advances are but a
prelude to future progress. Past accomplishments
must be multiplied a hundred-fold to visualize growth
during the next decade.
To scientists and engineers, missile systems tech-
nology presents unlimited scope for personal develop-
ment. Those desiring to participate in a scientific
effort of utmost importance are invited to address
inquiries to our Research and Engineering Staff.

This article will deal with the "Pro-
duction Engineering Show" situated at
Chicago's Navy Pier (an exhibition hall).
The basic theme of the show was the
advancement of control engineering. The
exhibits displayed the proper application
of control mechanisms, cutting tools, pre-
cision measuring devices, gages, electrical
equipment and metal-working accessories.
The 222 companies including names
like 'Westinghouse, General Electric,
Timken Roller Bearing, Square D and
U. S. Rubber played host to over 100,000
visitors.
By far the star of the show was auto-
mation. There are controls that do as
many as 100 different tasks, they order
the machines to bore, drill, shape, grind,
or shave metal into products. A punch
card tells the machines when to stop and
start, measures accuracy to within one-
ten thousandths of an inch, rejects prod-
ucts which do not measure up to standard,
conducts tests for surface smoothness and
even rings a bell or turns on a light
when the machine goes out of order.
The University of Michigan, along with
six other schools, were accorded the priv-
ilege of participating in the "Production
Engineering Show." The McGraw Hill
Publishing Company sponsored the col-
lege section in order to acquaint industry
with the role that our educational in-
stitutions are playing in the field of Pro-
duction Engineering. Also represented in
the college section were Case Institute,
Cornell, Ohio State University, M.I.T.,
Illinois Institute of Technology, and
Northwestern.
The University of Michigan exhibit
consisted of two parts—one was an Au-
tomatic Random Programmer and the
second, a series of charts, graphs, and
instruments pertaining to machineability
research. The Random Programmer was
developed and built by the Engineering
Research Institute's Electronic Defense
Group. Professor J. A. Boyd and graduate
student G. A. Roberts from the Electrical
Engineering Department combined their
efforts in making this section of the dis-
play a great success. The demonstrations
of machineability were sponsored by the
Production Engineering Department. Pre-
paration and presentation was handled
by Professors O. W. Boston and L. V.
Colwell, Instructors Irving Stewart and
Kenneth Ludema, Teaching Fellow D. C.
Graham, and graduate student M. Raim-
aswamy.
It is well known that purely random
sampling is necessary to the success of
statistical quality control. The Electronic
Defense Group's basic random selector
is fundamentally a random number gen-
erator of one digit binary form. The de-
sign allows the probability of occurence
of a "yes" to be adjusted between .0 and
1.0. A "question pulse" is necessary from
an external controlling device to request
a random number. The decision of the
selector is independent of the time at
which it is asked to make a choice. Thus
the machine can be questioned cyclicly
or randomly in time. The basic random
selector can be extended to make one
choice out of N possiblities by using N
"basic random selectors" and sampling
them in time sequence. If the basic ran-
dom selectors are numbered in sampling
sequence, the first basic random selector
to come up with a "yes" decision is the
random choice among the N possibilities.
(Information supplied by Mr. G. A.
Roberts in his paper "An Automatic
Random Programmer," Control Engin-
eering, Sept. 1955, page 136.)
The Production Engineering Depart-
ment exhibit essentially consisted of a
torque dynamometer with a single chan-
nel Sanborn recorder, a Profilometer
with an oscilliscope for visual represen-
tation of surface finish, and a tool-work
thermocouple device for obtaining cutting
temperatures. Also there were enlarged
photographs of a 300 H.P.-1,000 R.P.M.
lathe, a high-frequency vibration grind-
ing setup, and charts showing experi-
mental data on the machining of alumium
and titanium.
The torque dynomometer, built in the
P.E. Machine Tool Laboratory, was de-
signed to determine the torque required
during various tapping, reaming, and
drilling operations. The dynamometer
was of the strain gage type and the torque
is analyzed and recorded by the Sanborn.
In the tool-work thermocouple meth-
od, tool-work contact area serves as the
hot junction in a thermoelectric circuit
and the E.M.F. generated is proportional
to its temperature. This output E.M.F.
is measured with a sensitive potentio-
meter. With a suitable calibration, this
E.M.F. can be interpreted directly in
terms of the temperature. On a micro-
scopic scale the contact between chip and
tool on the cutting face is not continu-
ous, but consists of a series of peaks
and valleys, actual contact occuring be-
tween the peaks. Each such contact forms
a thermocouple junction and since these
junctions are all in parallel, the observed
E.M.F. represents an average value. How-
ever, the significance of this observed
E.M.F. cannot be belittled since the aver-
age temperature is of the greatest prac-
tical interest.
Through the use of a Profilometer
alone the average surface roughness can
be obtained to a millionth of an inch.
However, no indication of actual surface
profile can be ascertained by this method.
With the Profilometer-Oscilliscope com-
bination any variation from the average
can be observed.
In every respect the exposition was an
immense success. Those who visited the
various booths comprising the show were
impressed with the advance in machine
tool methods achieved during the past
few years. Of utmost importance also
was the interchange of ideas between in-
dividuals from universities and industry
which is vital to future progress in the
Production Engineering field.

GIANT "WORLD'S FAIR OF POWER"
Millions of dollars were spent on a new concept of a technical show,
"open to the general public." The interest shown by the over two
million visitors will probably prompt more shows of this type.
By far the biggest of the technical
shows in Chicago and the only one which
was open to the general public was the
General Motors Powerama, a representa-
tive display or demonstration of practi-
cally everything the many subdivisions of
General Motors manufacture.
Prepared by a team of GM specialists
seating 7000 persons. Produced and di-
rected by Richard and Edith Barstow of
Broadway and Hollywood fame, the stage
entertainment features tractors that do the
mambo, strength "contests" between ele-
phants and earthmovers, special music,
scores of dancers, a women's style show,
trained horses, and other attractions.

Featured at the Powerama Show was this faster, lighter, more economical Aerotrain.
in seven months the Powerama—largest
industrial show ever staged by one com-
pany—occupied 23 acres on Chicago's
lakefront. It was in January of this
year that Cyrus R. Osborn, GM vice-presi-
dent in charge of its engine divisions, first
conceived the idea of a "world's fair of
power" to focus national attention on
General Motors production in 1955 of its
100 millionth Diesel horsepower. Thus
Powerama was born.
Offering a kaleidoscopic array of at-
tractions ranging from earthmovers to
elephant's, Diesels' to dancing girls—and
dancing to tractors!—the giant "world's
fair of power" was open to the public
August 31-Sept. 25.
The biggest attraction was the "world's
first technological circus," an unique stage
show presented in an outdoor theatre
Introduced to the public at the Power-
ama is a revolutionary lightweight train,
designed and built by General Motors at
the request of a committee of railroad
presidents. It can carry 400 passengers
in air ride comfort reaching speeds of
over 100 miles an hour for sustained
stretches. All the major parts are standard
and already proven in use. The car bodies
are so low in first cost that they can be
thrown away and replaced much cheaper
than to repair and refurnish present day
costs. The car meets all safety require-
ments by a wide margin. The cost per
seat will be less than half that of present
coaches.
Included in the train display will be
a conventional, 2400 horsepower, high
speed General Motors passenger locomo-
tive installed with the front trucks raised
off of the tracks so visitors may actually
climb into the engineer's seat, pull the
throttle and "highball" an imaginary
famous-name train.
From GM's Motorama come the aston-
ishing "Kitchen of Tomorrow," "the
Kitchen of Today" seven experimental
"dream cars" and a "dream" truck. Also
featured are the XP121 Firebird, first gas
turbine automobile built and tested in
the United States, and the GM Turbo-
cruiser, a transit coach powered by a gas
turbine engine.
At a specially-constructed dock in a
lagoon is a marine exhibit including a
65-foot Florida shrimp boat, a yacht, the
largest tug on the Great Lakes—and a
Navy submarine of World War II fame,
the U.S.S. Tautog. Visitors are permitted
to board most of the craft.
Besides the submarine, an imposing ar-
ray of defense exhibits includes tanks and
other armored vehicles which are put
through their paces; an F-89 "Scorpion'
fighter plane; scale models of vertical
takeoff aircraft; Navy and Air Force
guided missiles; and military aircraft en-
gines.
Another defense feature is the Army's
atomic cannon. This 85-ton weapon can
fire an atomic shell accurately more than
20 miles.
Easy-to-understand demonstrations of
the principles of Diesel and gas turbine
power are featured not only in scores of
exhibits but also in a "Power for Prog-
ress" show presented by a GM staff in i
huge tent. To its Diesel and gas turbine
demonstrations, this show adds the "Sun-
mobile," a 15-inch model automobile
which is powered by sunlight (simulated
inside the tent by light from electric
lamps).

hibits designed to take Powerama visitors.

TOOL SHOP
by SHELDON LEVIN, '57I.E.
Spread over 488,000 square feet of
exhibit space at the International Amphi-
theatre in Chicago was the world's larg-
est machine tool shop with equipment
valued at more than $20,000,000.
Running from Sept. 6-17th the Ma-
chine Tool Show, sponsored by the Na-
tional Machine Tool Builders Association
was open to engineers and industrialists.
It was an exhibit of over 500 machine
tools of the very latest design built by
175 American manufacturers of metal-
working equipment who last displayed
their products eight years ago at the 1947
Machine Tool Show which was also held
in Chicago.
There were many new advances in
machine design for the more than 100,000
visitors to see. M. A. Hollengreen, Presi-
dent of the Landis Tool Co and the Na-
tional Machine Tool Builders Association,
said "In case after case the new machine
will do a job in a third, a tenth or even
a fiftieth of the time formerly required.
Never have advances in machine tool de-
sign been so rapid as in the last five
years."
The purpose of the show was twofold.
First of all the idea was to show company
engineers the latest machines out so they
could plan their new purchases and re-
placement schedules and to show them
how outdated many machines were. Sec-
ondly for the top executives and financial
men, who may have little technical knowl-
edge, but who are the people whose
approval is required for purchase of the
machines, the show demonstrated the
potential savings which their production
men had been telling them about, but
which they didn't really believe until they
saw it with their own eyes.
This the show definitely did, as practi-
cally every machine on the vast first floor
of the Amphitheatre was working and as
one walked through the maze of ma-
chinery the noise was so great you could
hardly hear yourself talk.
The cost of this show will easily be in
the millions as it cost one million dollars
just to move in the machinery.
Outstanding features of the show were
the advances in automation and automatic
controls, step up in accuracy which is now
measured in millionths of an inch instead
of thousandths, and a general increase in
the size of the machines. Exhibits at the
Machine Tool Show were confined entire-
ly to machine tools manufactured within
the United States. Meanwhile the Pro-
duction Engineering Show held simul-
taneously at Chicago's Navy Pier and writ-
ten up in this section was displaying
mechanisms, instruments and equipment
that are used with the machines at the
Machine Tool Show.
Some of the companies exhibiting at
the show were Brown and Sharpe Mfg.
Co., The Cincinatti Milling Machine
Company, Ex-Cell-O Corporation, Pratt
and Whitney, Warner and Swasey Co.
and many others. The products they
showed ran from Transfer Machines,
brakes, and drilling machines, to ultra-
sonic machines.

GOES TO GENEVA
by SHELDON LEVIN, '571. E.
From August 8-20 of this year the In-
ternational Conference on the Peaceful
Uses of Atomic Energy was held at
Geneva, Switzerland. Invited to partici-
pate first as a technical advisor and
later to read both of his submitted
papers to the Assembly was Professor
Henry J. Gomberg, Assistant Director
of the Phoenix Project. Also invited from
the University were Professor Lloyd Earl
Brownell and Professor Joseph J. Martin
who each presented a paper. In an
interview with Professor Gomberg, the
results, features and details of the Con-
ference were discussed. The views
paraphrased here represent his personal
ones only.
The primary emphasis of the confer-
ence was the development of atomic en-
ergy for power and the allied problems of
technology which includes such things
as metallurgy, chemical refining and ex-
traction, processing, and methods of ex-
ploration. Other topics were the applica-
tions of high energy radiation and
radioactive tracers.
There were no major revelations in
technology, but one thing the Americans
derived from the talks on this subject was
the realization that other countries and
particularly the Russians understand the
field quite thoroughly and have made very
good practical utilization of the theoreti-
cal work. It is apparent that the Russian
scientists are being given a free hand
economically. For instance in the descrip-
tion of a 5 megawatt power plant oper-
ating in Russia, equipment and machinery
is included that is being omitted from
power plant plans here in America, thus
indicating that no money was spared to
make the plant operate as soon as possi-
ble. The slight edge that America has
over Russia is probably due to the longer
time we have been working on nuclear
problems and not to any superiority of
intelligence, equipment, or financing.
Moving fastest in the public power
plant field are the British. They have by
far the most ambitious plans for utiliz-
ing nuclear power plants. The main rea-
son for this is the present high cost of
power in Britain. With our low cost of
A session of the "Atoms for Peace Conference."
power, we in America, are not pressed
for nuclear power plants so we are ex-
perimenting with many different types
of plants to find the best one. The
important thing to the British is time
and they, after finding a satisfactory plant,
the Calder Hall type, are working on that
one intensively and are trying to produce
it in quantity. (Calder Hall type is a con-
verter one of whose by-products is plu-
tonium. The British are very actively
studying the use of plutonium as a fuel
for a fast reactor which will breed more
fissionable material than it consumes.
A fast breeder is now under construction
at Dunderee, Scotland.)
Sir John Cockroft, head of Britain's
Atomic Energy Council and builder of
the first effective particle acelerator for
which he won a Nobel Prize said "one
half of Britain's electric energy would
come from nuclear plants by 1975." The
British have also done substantial work
in using radiation for chemical reactions,
and an ingenious system for tracing the
shift of silt in the Thames river was
presented.
When Dr. Walter H. Zinn, Director
of the Argonne National Laboratories,
described the extreme tests to which a
reactor similar to the one being built
at North Campus had been subjected, the
Russians indicated that they had learned
a great deal. In fact the safety of this
type of reactor, as demonstrated in these
tests, is the reason that the Phoenix
Project decided it could be built in the
middle of a University campus.
An interesting fact brought out at the
conference is that even though sevenl
countries had been secretly at work on
nuclear power there is no radical conflict
of theory between them, and the field is
developing among amazingly similar
lines.
One unscheduled effect of the meeting
was to emphasize the development of
nuclear fusion for peaceful purposes. The
United States divulged that it has a group
studying this field but as yet there ru&gt;
been no break-through.
In general, the United States gave out
14
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Most of the smaller countries that report-
ed gave mostly theoretical information,
very little on technology.
From the talks given it seemed that
Russia is using radioactive tracers in wide-
spread industrial uses than any other
country. They were, in fact, letting radio-
activity in small amounts carry over into
a finished product such as steel, one thing
the United States won't do yet.
Prof. Gomberg conversing with Russian
Scientist.
Probably the outstanding feature of the
conference was the amount of personal
contacts that could be made. Scientists
could get down to cases and discuss prob-
lems of different nations at the working
level, something which they had not been
able to do since before the war. Language
difficulties seemed to present little trouble.
In one case, Professor Gomberg, using
French, was able to converse with
a Russian scientist by means of a Russian-
French interpreter. Because of the new-
ness of the technology, many basic words
are the same in all languages and thus
makes translation of ideas much easier.
The Swiss group responsible for con-
verting the Geneva conference demon-
stration reactor which the Swiss govern-
ment purchased from the U. S. into a
useful research device, had written to
Ann Arbor (Gomberg) for information
on the University's installation. Learning
from Ann Arbor that he was in Geneva,
contact was made at the conference and
several technical sessions on reactor in-
stallations planning resulted.
The conference was organized and con-
ducted by the United Nations. The Presi-
dent was Dr. Henri J. Bhabha of India.
United States participated very heavily
in the conference. One of the Vice Presi-
dents was Dr. I. I. Rabi of the Univer-
sity of Columbia and the Conference Sec-
retary General was Professor Walter G.
Whitman of M.I.T. Out of 1400 dele-
gates from 73 nations, 183 were from
the U.S. Besides the delegates there were
3000 observers and 900 correspondents
attending the conference. Of the 1067
papers submitted, 535 were of U.S. origin
and 178 of the 450 orally presented were
ours. The subject matter of the United
States' papers covers every segment of the
Conference agenda, making this Country
the only on participating that will cover
the complete range of topics designated
for discussion. When the call went out to
scientists and engineers in industry, in-
stitutes of learning, and other areas of
atomic research early this year for sug-
gestions as to United States' contributions
to the Geneva Conference, more than
1,100 technical abstracts were received
by the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission
Office for International Conference. From
this collection of material, after careful
evaluation and combination, there emerged
the 535 U. S. papers which will be in-
cluded in the Conference's permanent
records.
The United States delegation also pro-
vided a full scale operating research re-
actor which was the most popular public
exhibit at the Conference, an official
technical exhibit providing an integrated
story of peacetime atomic energy develop-
ment, a technical reference library for the
use of delegates and a collection of tech-
nical films portraying atomic science and
technology.
One interesting item was that about 20
of the U. S. papers came from universities
and 4 of these came from the University
of Michigan. Most of the other major
universities such as M.I.T., Harvard, Chi-
cago and California were represented at
Geneva.
After the first few days of plenary
sessions which all delegates attended,
three parallel sessions were run in order
to hear all of the papers. The papers
were heard by simultaneous translation
in English, Russian, Spanish, and French.
Another sidelight of the Conference
was a flock of private industrial exhibits,
of which Britain probably provided the
most. Among the exhibitors were 150
U. S. concerns like Westinghouse, Union
Carbide and Carbon, and General Dy-
namics.
The following results of the Confer-
ence are excerpts from Dr. Bhabha's clos-
ing presidential address. "During the
conference, the feasibility of generating
electricity by atomic energy was demon-
strated beyond doubt. The economics of
atomic power generation were greatly
clarified. While the capital costs of atomic
power stations are still higher by 50 to
100% than those of conventional power
stations of a comparable size, the fuel

delegation to U. N. Disarmaments Committee, VV. W. Havens of Columbia
University, and Professor Gomberg. Behind Professor Gomberg is Cliff Beclt

Many engineers object strenuously to
forming or belonging to unions. Their ob-
jections do not necessarily represent an
ideological warfare with unions, since
most engineers do recognize the value
and importance of unions for the non-
professional industrial worker. For them-
selves, however, they feel unions can only
bring them into an unholy alliance which
jeopardizes their professional status and
blurs their position in the industrial or-
ganization. As an alternative the develop-
ment of stronger professional societies is
advocated.
Although unions and professional so-
cieties have essentially the same purposes,
many differences exist. For the present
analysis, the most important of these dif-
ferences is the manner of achieving and
maintaining control over members. Mem-
bers of professional groups are required
to subscribe to standards set up by the
profession and accept codes of ethics de-
veloped by the profession. Acceptance of
these rules for professional behavior does
not take the form of a contractual agree-
ment executed when an individual be-
comes a member of the professional so-
ciety. The process of acceptance is much
more subtle and begins early in the pro-
fessional training. In fact, a very im-
portant part of professional training is
learning and accepting the standards and
ethics of the profession and incorporating
them into one's general value system.
One way the professional group main-
tains control over its members is by po-
licing the institutions in which they work.
To be able to work as a professional re-
quires the professional stamp of approval.
The professional stamp of approval in the
form of a government issued license is
one of the most effective forms of con-
trol, since the profession sets the stand-
ards for licensing. Licensing gives a means
of legal enforcement of professional
standards.
The controls an industrial union exer-
cises over its members are much more
limited than those of a professional so-
ciety. Membership in a union only re-
quires acceptance of the explicit purposes
for which the union was formed. This
takes the form of a contractual agreement
which is executed for the time the indi-
vidual is employed in an establishment
covered by the particular union. Joining
a union does not necessarily require a
change in values of the individual; the
only requirement is that he accepts a po-
sition of democratic responsibility toward
his colleagues or fellow employees as he
does toward the members of his home
community.
Since an industrial union represents
employees in a particular organization
rather than all individuals doing particu-
lar types of work, it is impossible for a
union to control the total employment
picture for its members. A member may
change jobs and belong to the same union,
or he may do the same job and belong to
a different union. (This is especially true
since the Taft-Hartley Act has made the
"closed shop" illegal.) Under these con-
ditions, a democratic union can maintain
control over its members only by earning
and keeping their loyalty. True enough,
"union shop" and "maintenance of mem-
bership" clauses in union contracts are
legal controls the union has over its
members. These are controls, however,
which protect the majority of the mem-
bers from a dissident minority. If a dis~
sident minority should change to a major-
ity, the members can disfranchise their
union and substitute another. The union,
then, can exist only by servicing its mem-
bers in such a way as to command their
loyalty, whereas, the strong professional
society selects and indoctrinates its mem-
bers before entrance into the professional
fraternity and controls their employment
after they enter their professional life.
The question before the engineering
profession is which model will be follow-
ed to achieve better economic protection
for members of the profession. Will it be
the model of the traditional professional
society or a variation based on the model
of the industrial union? This decision is
not completely a matter of choice. To
build a strong professional society, the
profession must control both the institu-
tions of training and employment. At the
present time, the conditions under which
engineers are trained, the tasks they per-
form, and the organizations in which they
work are the model of the traditional pro-
fessional society very difficult, if not im-
possible, to follow.
Where Does the Engineer's Loyalty Lie?
A comparison of the training and con-
ditions of work for the medical and engi-
neering professions will bring into focus
the difficulties that the engineering pro-
fession faces in attempting to strengthen
their professional societies. JirnnijhejnQ;
rrrnt the student shifts medicine as a

rection of .strong identification with the
profession, whereas, ..the engineer is
oriented toward_individualism and reF-
ance on his own initiative. The medical
profession, as a result, maintains control
of and loyalty from the doctor with very
little difficulty. The engineering profes-
sion must compete with the loyalty de-
maoxled. by the organizations" in which
their rnejnber works.
The student who has just decided to
go into medicine has some idea about the
life of a physician because of his first
hand experience with them. He probably
aspires for the social status of the doctor,
widely accepted as a superior position in
society. The engineering student, on the
other hand, understands very little about
the tasks or position of the engineer in
society. In a study of mechanical engineer-
ing students, the majority reported they
had no idea what an engineer really did
at the time they started training. They
knew that being an engineer was prob-

ably better than working as a skilled
laborer but did not realize the potentiali-
ties of the profession. The student de-
ciding on a medical career understands
that he will become part of a very specific
group in society; the engineering student
views himself as moving up in the hier-
archy of industrial society. The concept
tions of the medical student prepare hirn^
for^ strong identity~withTus"professional
group, whereas, the engineering student
-txpectT Jo identify himself with an in-
Jus trial organization raiBer Than with his ,
^eUcgCjirofessionals.
There are very few limitations on who
can enter one field or another during
undergraduate training. Any one who can
pass the required courses can remain in
engineering school or in premedical train-
ing. The great difference arises at the end
of undergraduate training. A very small
percentage of pre-medical students are
selected for entrance into the profession
by very carefully and well organized
methods passed on by the medical profes-
sion. For the engineering student, an
engineering degree given at the end of
undergraduate training is the professional
stamp of approval.
After the engineering student has pass-
ed his courses, even though he was a
mediocre or poor student, the profession
cannot limit his activities as an engineer.
The firms who hire engineers make the
decisions about whom they will employ.
James W. Carper, author of An
Experiment for Engineers, is an ex-
perienced researcher in social
science. He holds a Ph.D. in psy-
chology from Johns Hopkins Uni-
versity. For the past two years, he
has been doing research in occu-
pational sociology under a Ford
Foundation Grant at the University
of Illinois. For his article in this
issue, he draws from the research
he has done on the engineering
profession. At present he is Re-
search and Educational Director
for a local union in Chicago.
A recommendation by a professor may
mean a better job, but, today, with such
great demand for engineers, there is sel-
dom an unemployed engineer. The person-
nel men who come to the universities to
interview the young engineer are more
concerned with personality characteristics
than with technical skill. The young engi-
neer will be trained on the job for the
particular position, so the important con-
sideration is whether his personal charac-
teristics fit him for the organization.
In the second phase of training, the
medical student is ushered into the clois-
tered halls of the profession. For the next
four or five years he will spend most of
his waking hours studying, with most of
his social contact limited to his professors
and fellow students. The engineering stu-
dent, quite differently, is thrown into the
wide world of industry. His on-the-job
training will be designed to fit him for
the industry in which he works. The chief
aim of this training is to develop the
young engineer to become a contributing
part of the whole productive process
rather than to develop him along profes-
sional lines. At this point the difference
between the two professions becomes
quite clear. While the medical student is
being trained in an atmosphere which
builds a strong professional identification
and loyalty, the engineer has assumed his
professional role which fosters identifica-
tion with and a primary loyalty to an in-
dustrial organization.
The present trend is for engineers to
take graduate training. Before deciding
on graduate school, the young engineer
debates whether the years spent in addi-
tional training in a university will be as
valuable to him as equivalent experience
in industry would be. Professors find it
necessary to encourage some of their best
students to continue on in graduate train-
ing. Even in graduate school the engi-
neering student does not live the sheltered
life of the medical student. He is con-
stantly made aware that finally he will go
into the world of industry where success
will not only depend on his technical
skill but on other judgments as well made
by his superiors in the industrial hier-
archy. His superiors may or may not be
other engineers.
After his training is completed, the
tasks a doctor performs keep him in close
relationship with his colleagues. His com-
petency can only be evaluated by his fel-
low doctors. It is on these evaluations that
his professional standing depends. Furth-
ermore, the growing specialization in the
medical profession requires the physician
to have close relationships with other
physicians with whom he must consult.
The engineer, on the other hand, believes
his training fits him for a wide number
of .taskv-some-ef-which"may utilize Jew
or none of his specific technical skills.
With such a-.vaxiety of possible tasks, the
profession may not be able to judge the
-competency of an engineer by technical—|
standards. More usually, the professional
success of an engineer will he based on
the judgment of his superiors in industry
rather than on criteria set up by his fel
low engineers. These conditions of work
do not foster close relationships between
[professional engineers. In fact, one engi-
neering student pointed out that a close
relationship with a colleague on the job
could hinder advancement. His implica-
tion was that if one was considered for
! advancement and his friend not, there
i may be some hesitancy in advancing one
and not the other. _
The final goal for many engineers is to
achieve a position in management. In
management, responsibilities as an execu-
tive must supercede responsibilities as an
engineer. The status of an executive re-
quiring small use of technical skills will
be more important than the status of an
engineer. For the doctor, quite differently,
any advancement is to a position of great-
er respect and greater power in the pro-
fession. Administrative posts which he
may hold are posts which require his
judgment as a physician.
The rapid growth of the engineering
profession and the increased demand for
engineers has emphasized the problem of
strengthening the position of the engineer
in industry. The Engineers' Council for
Professional Development, a conference
sponsored by eight national professional
engineering organizations, is devoted to
this cause. They distribute material to aid
the young engineer in understanding his

A.I.Ch.E.
The Michigan Student Chapter of the
American Institute of Chemical Engineers
has done much to supplement the class-
room education of its members for the
last thirty years. Last year marked one of
its most active years with a diversified
program that a membership of over eighty
enjoyed.
The chapter holds its meetings in the
Seminar Room, 3205 East Engineering
Building. These meetings consist of a
luncheon every Wednesday noon with a
movie, and one evening meeting with a
speaker and refreshments every three
weeks. The luncheon movies are usually
technical movies put out by chemical in-
dustries, but occasionally condensed ver-
sions of "Tale of Two Cities" and other
such classics "strangely" appear! The
luncheon costs only 50£ and offers "all
you can eat" with a variety of soup,
sandwiches, cookies and coffee. Faculty
often mix with the students at these
luncheons.
The evening meetings of the chapter
feature speakers from companies as Du-
Pont and Dow Chemical who explain
various phases of their industries and en-
lighten the student as to the role of the
chemical engineer in industry. These
meetings are closed with cider and dough-
nuts, and informal conversation with the
evening's speaker.
This year will be an especially big one
since the Michigan Chapter will be host
for this year's A.I.Ch.E. student chapter
Northwest Regional Convention. Some
eleven chapters from schools such as Ohio
State, Northwestern, and Notre Dame
will send delegates to Michigan for a di-
versified program that will require much
organization and planning by members of
the chapter.
The chapter enjoys a close relationship
with the faculty and, therefore, affords
the student excellent opportunity to de-
velop casual and informal, rather than
merely classroom acquaintances, with the
faculty. The many advantages of mem-
bership in the chapter, coupled with the
small amount of time required to enjoy
them, makes A.I.Ch.E. membership a
must for chemical engineers. If you are
interested in joining, contact Fred Baum-
gartner, Michigan Chapter President, at
NO 4-4295 (Chi Phi Fraternity House).

A.I.E.E.-I.R.E.
The American Institute of Electrical
Engineers and the International Radio
Engineers are organizations which pro-
mote programs to aid students and grad-
uates of Electrical Engineering.
Last year the AIEE-IRE at the Univer-
sity of Michigan sponsored the following
meetings and field trips:
1. Mr. O. E. Horneister of The Detroit
Edison Company: "Nuclear Power

5. Film: "The Univac Computer,"
University Film Service.
The membership dues to the local are
50 cents per semester. The AIEE and
IRE National dues are $5.00 per year,
which entitles the student to a monthly

Included on the agenda this year will
be two field trips, the dates as yet ten-
tative. A student paper contest with cash
awards is also going to be held next
spring.
The membership presently is 110 elec-
trical engineering students which makes
it one of the largest in the last five years.
All indications point to a successful year.
A.S.C.E.
Professional recognition is the goal
which every man, following a chosen pro-
fession, hopes to obtain.This goal is ob-
tained through a process of professional
development which normally has its be-
ginning with enrollment in college. It
is important to recognize at this time
that a well-balanced professional growth
is derived from two distinctly different
but equally important sources. For the
engineer the first is technological in na-
ture and the second is humanistic. The
first pertains to the attainment of a back-
ground of technical knowledge, experi-
ence, and skill; the second promotes a
philosophy which creates a spirit of
loyalty to the profession, a sense of moral
obligation to mankind, and an apprecia-
tion of the impact of technology on so
ciety. The student follows the first path
way naturally because it is prescribed.
The second he must find through volun-
tary contributions of public service and
association with organizations of his pro-
fession.
The Student Chapters of the American
Society of Civil Engineers provide the
opportunity for the beginnings of pro-
fessional associations. Membership in a
chapter assures that contracts can be
made with the technical and professional
progress of civil engineering and with
the leaders who are responsible for such
progress. Even more important, member-
ship offers the chance to take part in the
constructive activities carried on by fu-
ture leaders of the profession.
Student chapter meetings, held semi-
monthly, are given over to outside speak-
ers on technical or professional subjects.

engineering projects which are augment-
ed by field trips to points of engineering
interest.
Throughout the school year, organized
conferences of student chapters provide
opportunity for broadening outlook and
acquaintance. Sponsored by chapters, or
groups of chapters, the conferences are
held in cities or on campuses where ade-
quate facilities are provided for both
professional sessions and social activity.
This year, sponsored by the Michigan
Chapter, the annual conference for our
district will be held here in Ann Arbor.
The Michigan Chapter feels confident
that this conference will be one of the
best ever given.
Those Civil Engineering students who
wish to join the Society should contact
either Professor R. B. Harris, 13 West
Engineering Bldg., or John Carroll, tele-
phone Normandy 2-3143, for further
information. Membership may also be
obtained by attending one of the chapter
meetings. The time and place of these
meetings will be posted on the Civil En-
gineering bulletin board located across
from room 305 in the West Engineering
Bldg.
A.S.M.E.(S.A.E.)
The primary objective of the American
Society of Mechanical Engineers is to
serve its members in anyway possible. In
line with this objective, in the school year
1954-55, the local chapter planned and
executed five outstanding plant trips in-
cluding trips to the General Motors Tech-
nical Center in Detroit, a trip to Parke
Davis Pharmaceutical Co. in Detroit, and
a trip to Consumer's Power Facilities near
Monroe, Michigan. In addition, eight lec-
tures of both technical and general inter-
est were planned for A.S.M.E. members.
The subjects ranged from basic technical
talks, such as the one on the design of
the Chevrolet V-8 engine, to a talk of
more general interest such as the one
given by Dean Brown on the new engi-
neering curricula.
Although both the local meetings and
the plant trips are open to all interested,
there are several distinct advantages in
being an active member of the Society.
First, the student member pays half, or
less, of the fee charged of non-members
for plant trips. In addition, the member
receives nine issues of the A.S.M.E.
National Monthly Journal. He is also en-
titled to compete for the cash awards of-
fered to students by the Society, and,
fittingly, makes the decisions as to what
subjects are deemed of interest enough
to warrant inviting speakers.
Any engineering student is welcome to
join the Society, regardless of his depart-
ment of specialization. Although a stu-
dent may join anytime during the school
year until April 1st, the student who joins
early in the fall receives more benefits
than a person joining in the spring. The
membership fee also covers the refresh-
ments served at most meetings. Starting
this year the student chapter of A.S.M.E.
has permanently merged with that of the
Society of Automotive Engineers. The
members and officers of both groups feel
the benefits of a larger working member-
ship will be even more evident this year
than they were during the trial year of
1954-55.
American Society of Tool Engineers
The University of Michigan student
chapter of the A.S.T.E. was organized to
supplement classroom education in the
field of manufacturing and production
engineering. The chapter holds the dis-
tinction of being the first student group
to be chartered by the national organiza-
tion. The membership is made up largely
of mechanical and industrial engineering
students.
The program for the coming year in-
cludes plant trips, speakers from industry,
and industrial films. Particular emphasis
will be given to the machine tools re-
quired to make modern production pos-
sible. Members derive benefits not only
through the educational program offered
but also from personal contacts with in-
dustrial leaders in this area. These con-
tacts are fostered through activities with
senior chapters such as joint sponsorship
of regional A.S.T.E. meetings with the
Ann Arbor chapter.
All student members receive the month-
ly A.S.T.E. journal as well as other
A.S.T.E. publications. Upon graduation
the student can have his membership
transferred to a junior membership in the
national organization without paying ini-

by HOWARD UROW, '581. E.
The recruitment and employment of
engineering graduates for industry to a
major degree is guided by a statement of
basic company philosophy which states
that, "people are the company's greatest
asset." The important interpretation of
this philosophy for the engineering grad-
uate is that industry employs the whole
individual—not just his class standing,
not just his extra-curricular activities, nor
his grades in differential equations—nor
any combination in themselves of these
or other examples one could mention. The
important consideration is: Does this per-
son have professional competence and
personal attributes which can be develop-
ed to the candidate's and the company's
mutual advantage in employment at a
given time.
These two broad areas of professional
(or technical) competence and personal
attributes (or characteristics) are basic
in an evaluation of individuals for em-
ployment. Regardless of the type of work
a person does, he utilizes skills in both
areas at all times. The degree to which
he is successful in applying these skills
to his job affects his progress within an
organization. Support for the use of these
concepts can be drawn from the fact that
research work to discover new products
and new production methods, coupled
with effective management of the present
business are vital to the continued success
of a company.
The need for employing people who
have demonstrated professional compe-
tence and who possess such personal char-
acteristics as leadership, judgment, moti-
vation, co-operation, initiative, honesty,
integrity, to name a few, is evident in
the need for people to organize, direct
and supervise the activities of a corpora-
tion. Many attributes of an individual fall
into both areas—such things as ability in
verbal and written expression and crea-
tivity are examples.
The personal interview is the most
widely used and probably the most re-
liable method of selection used by indus-
try today. The number and lengths of
these interviews vary, but a majority of
decisions are made at the conclusion of
less than 8 hours total interviewing time
with company representatives. Industry
would like to have more time, but the
time available to the candidate, and time
required on the part of the companies
usually prevents this. Improvements in in-
terview techniques are constantly being
developed by industry and university's
personnel research staffs. It appears that
this method of selection will continue
to be used for a long time to come; we
hope, with research continually providing
more knowledge in this complicated and
fascinating field.
The industrial interviewers are aided
in their selection responsibility by many
other sources. Some of these are routine
reference investigations for purposes of
verification of information on applica-
tions. Others are faculty, friends, former
employers, official records, etc. However,
it is a rare exception when employment
is offered without one or more personal
interviews between the candidate and
prospective employer. It is during these
interviews that the applicant's personal
and professional qualifications are ex-
amined, and the decision on his suitabil-
ity for employment is made.
For engineering graduates one aspect
of professional competence is the course
content studied by the student. From the
undergraduate's view point a large part
of this is decided for him. Colleges and
universities have a tremendous responsi-
bility in this regard. Educational adminis-
trators are constantly studying and re-
vising curricula based on information
they obtain from their own self-appraisal,
talking with graduates, and consulting
with industries who employ engineers.
An excellent job is done in this respect,
and the engineering graduates today are
well prepared to accept industrial assign-
ments.
Because of the diversity of work car-
ried on in a large organization, demon-
strated versatility on the part of the appli-
cant to accomplish a variety of assign-
ments commands respect on the part of
the interviewers. For example; outstand-
ing achievement in humanities courses
coupled with a similar record in the
chosen field of engineering is evidence
that the applicant may have ability to suc-
ceed in more than one career. On the
other hand a good record in one with a
poor record in the other raises some ques-
tions in the interviewer's mind. What are
the reasons for this? The answers given
have important bearing on the candi-
date's suitability. A poor record in itself
in both phases in its simplest interpreta-
tion means that this applicant has not
done as well as others, and he would be
last in line for consideration on the edu-
cational aspects of his record. Most em-
ployers are willing to compromise more
on the record in non-technical or humani-
ties courses than they are in the technical
courses for engineering applicants.
Most engineering curricula contain
"key" courses which are carefully watched
by prospective employers. In addition
there are certain basic courses usually
taken in the freshman and sophomore
year which experience has shown are
fairly good "predictors" of success in en-
gineering. An engineer should do well in
the required courses in physics, chemistry,
The author of the article about in-
dustry's requirements of the young en-
gineer, Howard Urow, has been with
the Technic staff since last year. He is

of the nation's largest companies to find out what qualifications
they were looking for in the engineers they hired. Here is what
he found:
and mathematics. The "scientific approach"
often referred to and which is taught in
these courses together with the under-
standing of many of the basic scientific
principles is necessary knowledge for the
engineer.
The two final years contain courses in
the specific field of engineering the stu-
dent has chosen. Industry expects the ap-
plicant to do well in these courses. This
is evidence of understanding, motivation,
hard work, or natural ability, or a com-
bination of all of these. Regardless of the
reason it is a desirable bit of evidence.
For example—the chemical engineer who
fails physical chemistry, and unit opera-
tions, regardless of grades in his other
courses has considerable explaining to
convince an employer he is a capable
chemical engineer. The civil engineer who
fails his structures design courses has a
lot to account for before he is employed
as a civil engineer. The mechanical engi-
neer who finds thermodynamics and
strength of materials beyond comprehen-
sion raises serious doubts—and similarly
for the other fields of engineering. Nor
is it enough to do well in these "key"
courses and poorly in others in engineer-
ing. Although not as serious it will raise
questions of adaptability, versatility,
breadth of interest, etc., in the minds of
the company interviewers.
Industry is protected against the ex-
tremes used as examples by the univer-
sities since they maintain standards of
achievement a student must meet in order
to stay in school. Therefore, the student
who meets these minimums is in a com-
petitive position with everyone else who
meets them. It should be mentioned at
this point that every engineer who grad-
uates has demonstrated that he posses
above average mental ability, and has ac-
quired knowledge, which, if properly ap-
plied can equip him for an engineering
career. Its quite simple then and resolves
into something like this—on the basis of
professional competence alone the em-
ployer has greater confidence in the ap-
plicant's ability to handle the technical
phases of the future assignment if the
man is at the top of his class, than if he
is at the bottom. Technical ability is more
important in certain types of work such
as research or development.
The other aspect of engineering train-
ing—the non-technical subjects has been
belabored often in articles concerned with
the need for ability in written and verbal
expression on the part of engineering
graduates. More broadly defined this
could be described as exposure to some
of the humanities and liberal arts courses
during the student's college career. The
discussion concerned with how much of
this should or could be incorporated in
the engineers training is a continuing one.
Everyone agrees there should be some of
this training—the question of how much
and what does not bring forth a unani-
mous answer. One problem is that the
need for this type of training varies con-
siderably among individuals because of
the diversity of backgrounds prior to en-
tering college.
The engineer who shows during his in-
terviews to have a lack of understanding
and appreciation of economics, history,
literature and English prejudices his
chances of employment. Again industries
are protected by certain minimum stand-
ards established by the universities which
the engineer must meet to stay in school.
Deficiencies in this respect may be dis-
covered indirectly—that is through gen-
eral conversation, written matter sub-
mitted to the employer, etc. Detailed
questioning may not be followed by in-
terviewers on these subjects.
While on the subject of non-technical
course content another phase of college
life is given careful attention by com-
pany interviews. This is to what extent
has the engineer taken advantage of the
opportunity to participate in extra-cur-
ricular activities. Evidence of the candi-
dates ability to work with a group, his
sense of values, and leadership potential
as well as his general outlook on life can
be obtained from this information.
This leads into consideration of the
other broad area of the candidates quali-
fications—his personal characteristics, per-
sonality, or whatever general term is used.
Dissatisfaction and failures on the job
are more often attributed to this area than
to deficiencies in technical ability. Conse-
quently they assume importance in con-
sidering the engineer for employment.
The engineer could safely assume that
answers to questions designed to obtain
information in this area would result in a
variety of interpretations among inter-
viewers. However, the personal interview
is largely justified on the basis of the
need to obtain this information. Impres-
sions of these personal characteristics left
by the engineer on those he interviews
have a considerable bearing on the job
offer. Some of the attributes have been
mentioned above—the list is extensive,
and many are either not clearly defined,
or differently interpreted by people.
The requirements that industry looks
for in a graduate engineer should be
consciously recognized by the student dur-
ing his college career so that he can de-
velop in these characteristics. Some are
native; some can be taught. What should
the young engineer know of the attributes
which he should demonstrate to his em-
ployer if he is to succeed? Most of us are
good enough so that if we do our job
as well as we can, and have other attri-
butes that fit in, we make a part of a
good organization. An organization that is
made up of people who are specialists in
one line or another with no aptitude,
ability, or interest in other necessary lines
would not be a good organization. So, a
man should recognize that he should be
as good as possible in all departments.
One of the things that industry wants
in people is INTELLIGENCE. You cant
teach intelligence. You can try to define
it. You can make people aware of the fact
that we are consciously looking for intel-
ligence. More intelligent people attend
college than don't. An extremely intel-
ligent person does not always need an
education, but he would be better off with
it. Without it he may not be happy; he
may not go as fast or as far without an
education. Intelligence is ability to think
logically and analytically, comprehensive-
ly, quickly, and creatively.
EMPLOYMENT STABILITY is an
important factor in a young engineer's
growth. He has spent at least four years
preparing himself for a career—not a job
■—but a career. How long does it take to
break into that career and get into what

FOR ENGINEERS
by PROFESSOR ROBERT PIDD
Many students feel that undergraduate laboratory training
is dull and uninstructive; they call the experiments "cookbook
exercises." Robert Pidd, a young associate professor of physics,
suggests a fresh, practical, creative approach to the problem: an
omnibus lab in which students do not do "canned" experiments.
Two years from now students in the junior year of the new Science
Engineering Curricurum will probably be the first to enroll in
omnibus labs.
Experience in science teaching has
shown that formal classroom and labora-
tory experience go only a part of the way
in training undergraduate students for a
productive and creative career. The ex-
tra-curricular work that a student may
do on a professor's research project and
an association with graduate students do-
ing original research will contribute great-
ly toward an undergraduate's approach to
his field. This type of training is both
practical and intangible and, unfortun-
ately, in a large university reaches only a
small fraction of the students. An or-
ganized but informal laboratory can be
conceived which would make research
training available to all students rather
than to a fortunate few. Such a laboratory
would be "expensive" both in staff and
equipment, but expense must be measured
in terms of the yield. Also there is a tre-
mendous research potential in a Univer-
sity such as Michigan and it is possible
that, by careful organization, the expense
may not be so great as it may first ap-
pear. For example, the graduate students
might be organized to help more in our
training of undergraduates than they do
now, with a resulting benefit to graduates
and undergraduates and the school itself.
These remarks have been applied to
science teaching, and particularly in
Physics we are attempting to implement a
new kind of undergraduate laboratory. A
moment's reflection suggests that it is just
as appropriate, if not more, for young
engineers to develop a practical, fresh,
and creative approach to the knowledge
in their field. Much of the design work
which has gone into the development of
the new Science Engineering curriculum
has been directed toward strengthening
the students' formal training. While the
reforms which have been suggested for
the classroom work are excellent ones,
and probably long overdue, they tend to
ignore what is probably the weakest part
of our educational system of science teach-
ing, namely, training for research. There
has been the tacit assumption that the
laboratories attached to our formal courses
will be "good" laboratories, but there has
been little discussion which suggests that
the problem of laboratory training is a
crucial one.
The Problem
The common type of undergraduate
laboratory training in large universities
is the target of the following criticisms:
A. The "timed" laboratory.
There is an emphasis in a 2-, 4-, or
even 8-hour laboratory period on per-
forming the experiment as quickly
and "efficiently" as possible. In fact
the instructor will see to it that there
is plenty of material to fill the period.
Often, the main pressure is to get the
data tables filled. This presumes, of
course, that the laboratory problem is
so straightforward that there is neith-
er time nor incentive to think about
the problem. This is an extreme criti-
cism, but it applies in some measure
to all our laboratories.
B. The "canned" experiment.
This criticism approaches the same
problem from a different point of
view. 90% of an experimentalist's
work is in setting up his problem,
first on paper and then with working
apparatus. The set-up experiment (an
experiment in which the wires are
not actually connected may still be a
set-up) bypasses the major experimen-
tal problem.
C. Errors.
The typical error encountered in a
canned experiment is a reading error
on a meter. The errors in a live ex-
periment are mostly of another type—
where it is not clear that all the vari-
ables are fixed, it is not clear what all
the variables are, and where, finally,
it is up to the experimenter to demon-
strate that he is measuring what he set
out to measure. There is a distinction
here between error and precision, and
it is usually the more trivial aspect of
precision which is encountered in the
typical laboratory.
There can be another much more
fundamental problem in precision
when the variables have been identi-
fied and the question of ultimate pre-
cision arises. There are physical limi-
tations of a kind which no instrument
can beat, e.g., thermal noise or Brown-
ian motion, the finite band-pass of an
amplifier, the uncertainty principle in
wave motion, etc. One of the marks of
a competent research man is that he
knows what is physically possible with
the very best apparatus. That is, he
knows the limitations as well as the
power of his methods. Also it is im-
portant to know technological limita-
tions: what are the best vacua, the
best vacuum tubes, etc.
D. Scope.
The traditional course structure sep-
arates knowledge into compartments.
It is very difficult to call on a student s
knowledge of, say, chemistry and
engineering materials in a laboratory
course on electrical machinery. The
choice and scope of experimental
problems is restricted by compartment-
ing the laboratories.
There is a stress in the new cur-
riculum on lowering some of the bar-
riers among the formal courses, oo

Phoenix Lab Dedicated
New fields of atomic research opened
to University of Michigan scientists last
June with the dedication of an ultramod-
ern laboratory believed to be unequalled
outside government facilities.
Named the Phoenix Memorial Labora-
tory, the three-story, glass and brick
structure is a living monument to the
University's dead of World War II.
The Si,500,000 structure will make
possible studies involving the most pow-
erful sources of atomic energy. It con-
tains the latest facilities for handling and
storing these materials.
A $1,000,000 nuclear reactor is under
construction at one end of the building,
and will be in operation next year.
The Laboratory and reacter have been
made possible by gifts to the University
of Michigan Memorial-Phoenix Project,
a program of study of the peaceful uses
of atomic energy.
"There is no other non-governmental
laboratory in the country like this," re-
ports Dr. Henry J. Gomberg, assistant
"Space Clock" developed for the age of interplanetary travel
Credit: Hamilton
director of the Project. "In it, we can
use radiation to help create new mater-
ials, alter old ones, probe the structure
of matter, effect genetic changes in living
material, and interfere with or kill unde-
sired organisms or growths." There will
be no security restrictions.
Located on the University's mush-
rooming North Campus, the structure is
an "atomic headquarters" containing:
Two radiation "caves," one for remote
control experiments with materials from
the reactor, the other for investigations
utilizing a 3,000 Curie source of Cobalt
60. The caves have walls three feet thick,
nine-ton doors and specially treated win-
dows. Each chamber cost $150,000.
A greenhouse for the study of the
effect of direct radiation on growing
plants.
The Mason Memorial Library and read-
ing room, devoted to volumes on atomic
energy.
A high-gamma room, a labyrinth
chamber where the cobalt source is to be
installed this summer. With it, U-M sci-
entists will pasteurize foods, sterilize ma-
terials and promote chemical reactions.
The room incorporates design features
suggested by two years of experiments
with a similar source on the main uni-
versity campus.
A "counting room" containing instru-
ments to monitor radioactivity, make
scientific measurements and provide pre-
cise analysis.
A system of absolute filters that "take
everything but the air" out of the ex-
haust gases from individual laboratories.
No radioactive particles will be omitted
from the building's 75-foot-tall exhaust
stacks.
Rows of sealed "caves" each of which
is a miniature "laboratory" for remote
control experiments. About four feet
across, they have their own ventilation
and plumbing systems.
Engineering and physical science proj-
ects will be located on the first floor of
the laboratory, one side of which is
underground. The second floor contains
the library, offices, memorial lobby,
workshops and utilities. The third floor,

Aerodynamics Engineers at Lockheed are working on advanced prob-
lems that cover virtually every phase of aircraft. The full scope of
their work can be seen in the wide range of aerodynamics problems
encountered in Lockheed's diversified development program.
Among the advanced problems are:
1 Determine means of controlling a supersonic vertical rising aircraft
through the transition flight stages from horizontal to vertical flight.
2 Determine the dynamic response of supersonic aircraft in high rate
rolls by application of five degrees of freedom analysis procedures.
3 Study optimum operating descent procedures to minimize costs on
a new turboprop commercial aircraft.
4 Conduct and analyze wind tunnel research on new and radically
different external radomes to be carried at high speed by early
warning aircraft.
5 Perform generalized aeroelastic analysis combining structural and
aerodynamic knowledge to determine optimum lateral control de-
vices for use on very high speed, low load factor aircraft.
These —and many other —significant problems have created new posi-
tions for experienced Aerodynamics Engineers and Aerodynamicists
in Lockheed's expanding program of diversified development.

PROJECTS
Our eight current military contracts
support a broad range of advanced
development work in the fields of
modern communications, digital com-
puting and data-processing, fire-con-
trol, and guided missiles. This work is
supplemented by non-military activi-
tiesin the fields of operations research,
automation, and data-processing.
FINAMCE8
In 1954,our first full year of operation,
we showed a good profit. Of greater
importance, however, are the arrange-
ments recently completed with
Thompson Products, Inc., our corpo-
rate associate, whereby we are assured
additional funds up to $20,000,000
to finance our expansion requirements
of the next few years, and insure the
long-range stability of the company.
After Twenty-One Months...
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PERSONNEL
Total population figures, such as those displayed in the curve,
tell only a limited story. Personnel quality factors are most
important, in our kind of business. We believe we are doing
well in this respect. Of the 90 Ph.DIs, 65 M.SIs and 75 B.SIs
or B.A!s who today make up our professional staff, a gratify-
ingly high percentage are men of broad experience and,
occasionally, national reputation in their fields.
FACILITIES
By mid-1956 our Los Angeles facility will consist of seven build-
ings totalling 300,000 square feet of modern research and devel-
opment space. Two of the three buildings now complete and
occupied are shown at bottom of this page; a fourth and fifth are
presently under construction, the others are in the design stage.
MAN U FACTU RI NG
We are somewhat ahead of the usual systems develop-
ment schedule, with some of our projects having arrived at the
field and flight-test stages. We are now planning a facility for
quantity production of electronic systems. Construction on the
initial unit of 160,000 square feet (shown above) is expected to
start in late 1955, with manufacturing planned for late 1956.
The Future
Our first year and a half of corporate history
encourages us in the belief that our future will be one
of expanding productivity. But whether we remain a small
company or grow large, we plan not to lose sight of the fact that
the continued success of The Ramo-Wooldridge Corporation depends
on our maintaining an organizational pattern, a professional
environment, and methods of operating the company that are
unusually well suited to the very technical, very special needs
of modern systems development and manufacturing.

The answer to that is definitely "Yes!", Charlie. We've
employed quite a number of college graduates with
definite military commitments, sometimes knowing that
they could work only a few weeks before reporting for
active duty.
The reason is that Du Pont is primarily interested
in men on a "long range" basis. The fact that they're
temporarily unavailable—for a good reason like mili-
tary service—isn't any bar to being considered for
employment. After working only one day, an employee
is guaranteed full re-employment rights—that's the
law. But if a man works for Du Pont at least a full
year before joining the service, he gets a bonus of two
months' salary. If he's entitled to a vacation but doesn't
have time to take it before leaving, Du Pont gives him
equivalent pay instead.
Even if present employment is impossible, Charlie,
we definitely recommend your talking with Du Pont's
representatives—and those of other companies, too.
The very least you'll gain will be valuable background
and some contacts which may be of real benefit to you
when you leave military service.

What a difference! The hard Synthane surface does
not become imbedded with foreign particles. Synthane
is anti-static and non-magnetic, doesn't attract metal
chips which could scratch the surface.
Synthane is also chemical-resistant; plating acids have
little effect upon it, and being an electrical insulator,
Synthane does not short the electroplating currents.
The net result is a 3 to 5 times longer life for Synthane*

Freshman Engineering Class Board
The 1955-56 Freshman Engineering
Class Board should be the best the fresh-
man engineers have seen.
This unit, which is the governing body
of the freshman engineers, began a climb
towards strong student government two
years ago when an active group of stu-
dents took the reins. Last year, the Board
—then the Freshman Engineering Coun-
cil—held a dance solely for engineers.
The group also sponsored a Cinema Guild
movie and made concrete plans for the
1955-56 Class Board.
The Board has a standard two semester
term. Several members are elected each
fall, and a proportionately smaller num-
ber of members are elected from the
spring class. Thus, some members are held
over the summer.
Elections are conducted through the
Freshman Engineering Assembly program
by means of a popular vote. To become a
candidate for the Board, a student need
only obtain a certain number of signa-
tures on a petition. Details on the peti-
tions and the election will be given dur-
ing the assembly program.
The Engineering Council
In order to coordinate the effects of
the many technical societies and class or-
ganizations and to unify and direct stu-
dent effort and opinion in matters affect-
ing all engineering students, some sort
of overall student governing body is
necessary in the Engineering College. This
need is filled by the Engineering Council,
a group composed of the presidents of
the major technical societies, the presi-
dents of the class organizations, and the
chief officers of other prominent organi-
zations (including the Michigan Tech-
nic) in the Engineering College. Each
spring, in addition to the membership
outlined above, the Council chooses five
"Members-at-Large" to serve for one year
terms. Any student scholastically eligible
may petition, and underclassmen are par-
ticularly encouraged to petition, for one
of these posts.
Foremost among new Council projects
planned for this fall is a student opinion
poll to evaluate teachers and teaching
methods in the College. In this and other
activities the Council attempts to work
closely with both the college administra-
tion and faculty groups; so that effort is
not wasted chasing tangents, and so that
what is done has maximum value and
meaning for administration, faculty, and
students.
This is a necessarily brief resume of
what the Engineering Council has done
and is doing. Every engineering student
owes it to himself and to his classmates
to support his technical societies and class
organizations and, through them, to sup-
port the Engineering Council. The serv-
ice that the Council can render is di-
rectly proportional to the support it re-
ceives.
Engineering Honor Council
The Engineering Honor Code has long
been a mark of the integrity of the Mich-
igan Engineer. Since 1914 students here
have had the opportunity to study under
this Code and assume the responsibilities
which it offers—to be honest when judg-
ing ones self and others. To aid this
judgment, the Honor Council was estab-
lished to function both as a judicial and
educational body of students.
When violations of the Honor Code are
reported, either by students or the faculty,
the Council meets with those in question
to determine their guilt or innocence. The
student is helped to understand how and
why he has made his mistakes and is as-
sisted in correcting them. An individual
should know that he is not being punish-
ed unjustly; but that by violating the
Honor Code, he has harmed himself, his
friends, and his College. If he realizes
this, the student is not likely to repeat his
violation.
Besides the judicial function, it is the
Council's responsibility to make sure
every member of the student body under-
stands fully the principles of the Code.
Each year members of the Council speak
to incoming freshmen and transfers to
acquaint them with the Code and answer
their questions. Also from time to time,
the Council booklet is revised to meet
new policy that the students wish to be
incorporated in the operation of their
Honor Code.
The Honor Council consists of 9 stu-
dents: 4 are chosen every semester for a
year term and one is appointed by Vul-
cans. The applicant fills out a petition
containing his reasons for desiring mem-
bership and possible means for improving
the Code. This petition is then discussed
during a 10 minute interview between the
applicant and the Honor Council. Any-
one with a 2.00 overall in the Engineer-
ing College is eligible for membership.
Petitioning dates are in December and
May, and notices will appear to that effect
on the Honor Council bulletin board in
the vestibule of West Engineering Build-
ing. There is a list of current Council
members posted on this board at all
times, so that anyone desiring more in-
formation can feel free to call.
To readily understand the great respon-
sibilities vested in the Honor Council, it
should be known that the body is en-
tirely student run and is not under direct
supervision of the Faculty. All decisions
are final unless an appeal is filed to the
Faculty Disciplinary Board. In the 41
years of the Council's existence, none of
its decisions have ever been reversed.
The Honor Council feels that it pos-
sesses among the most important and
valuable opportunities which Campus life
at Michigan offers. One cannot only gain
experience in judging people but also can
have the satisfaction of helping correct
the faults that can hinder them in later
life. Think seriously when considering a
campus activity and "PETITION YOUR
HONOR COUNCIL."
Sigma Rho Tau
Sigma Rho Tau is the national engi-
neering speech society organized 26
years ago on this campus for the purpose
of helping engineers to learn how to ex-
press their ideas more effectively through
the spoken word. Since 1929 it has grown
to four chapters.
It is generally agreed among men in all
fields of business that engineers who are
able to get ideas across clearly are val-
uable. The young engineer will find
plenty of opportunity to practice public
speaking by attending the weekly meet-
ings of Sigma Rho Tau. He will be given
the opportunity to practice and develop
public speaking ability both here at the
University and in intercollegiate contests.
This semester with an eye to fostering
interest in speech activities in the College
of Engineering, Sigma Rho Tau will con-
duct a Freshman Engineers' Speech Con-
test with prizes of $25, $15, and $10. The
contest will be open to any interested

Sophomore Engineering Council
In the spring of 1954 the Freshman
Engineering Class felt a need for class
organization extending into the soph-
omore year; the result of this feeling
was the forming of the Sophomore Engi-
neering Council. The purpose of this
council is to represent the large number
of sophomore engineers who have not
chosen their field of development or who
have not joined departmental societies,
and also to fulfill the need for represen-
tation of the Sophomore Class in the Col-
lege of Engineering functions.
Last fall the council requested and was
granted recognition on the new Engi-
neering Council. One of the basic reasons
for seeking the representation was to give
a part in the Engineering's Council activi-
ties to the many sophomore engineers
who are not in departmental societies and
who are not reached by the five members
at large to the council. By having the
Sophomore Council represented in the
Engine Council, there is a more direct
method of representing the sophomore
by placing him under a specific category.
The aim of the Sophomore Council is
"to aid the Engineering Council in all
possible ways and specifically by pre-
senting problems which can best be
handled by the Engineering Council."
At the present time new members are
chosen by petition and interview with the
outgoing members.
Beside the main task of getting repre-
sentation on the Engineering Council, the
Sophomore Class Board also helped ex-
tensively during the Engineering Open
House.
Tau Beta Pi
Tau Beta Pi was founded in the latter
part of the 19th century for the expressed
purpose of recognizing achievement in
(Continued from page 31)
the field of engineering. Scholastic record,
moral and ethical character, personality,
and extracurricular activities are the basis
for selection. Tau Beta Pi has grown a
great deal in size and now has nearly 100
chapters in the United States.
At Michigan the membership ranges
from 60-90, depending upon the num-
ber of students in school and other fac-
tors. The group is interested in educa-
tional, social, and project type activities.
Meetings are held semi-weekly and are
devoted to speakers, discussions, business,
and other informative programs. As part
of the social calendar two banquets, a
weekend at a nearby lake, and other social
functions are held each year. Projects are
continually varying and include such
things as a brush up session for the Pro-
fessional Engineers Examination, and the
publication of a small problem booklet in
conjunction with the review session.
Because of its nature as an honorary
organization, membership is gained
through a selective process and is limited
to upperclassmen. However, Tau Beta Pi
has a very strong and active alumni or-
ganization aand for most members this
means a very pleasant and worthwhile
experience.
Michigan Technic
The Technic is the oldest engineering
college magazine in America being en-
tered as second-class matter in 1881.
Though old and wise the Technic is
always in need of fresh ideas and new
blood. There is plenty of room for new-
comers.
Many students think that they have to
be a Sinclair Lewis or a Shakespeare to be
on the staff. Actually, although good
writers are always needed, there are many
jobs on the staff which require complete-
ly different types of talent. To mention a
few there are advertising, circulation, and
illustrations. No matter what you're good
at, there's room for you at the Technic.
Another thing students fear is that it
will take too much of their time, but you
only spend as much time as you can spare
at the Technic and it never amounts to
more than a few hours a week. This little
time is well spent as you get much valu-
able experience on how to put a magazine
out, how to twist an article out of a pro-
fessor, and how to run a business. Then
at the end of the year there's a big steak
dinner. So let's see more people at the
steak dinner.
Triangles
Triangles is the Junior honorary society
in the College of Engineering. It was
founded in 1917 for the recognition of
outstanding extra-curricular activities on
the part of Sophomore Engineers.
Being an honorary society, its main
purpose is to promote interest in activities
in the College of Engineering and in the
University as a whole. It also attempts to
perform services for the Engineering
school. As an example Triangles recently
purchased an oil painting of Professor
Kessler, who died several years ago.
They intend to hang the portrait in an
activities room in the new student activi-
ties building.
The members of Triangles must be of
Junior standing in the College of Engi-
neering and are tapped twice a year by
the active members. AH membership ends
in the Senior year.
Vulcans
Vulcans is the senior engineering hon-
orary for men. It was founded in 1904
for the purpose of recognizing achieve-
ment in scholastic and extracurricular ac-
tivities. The membership totals about 20,
with men being tapped in their senior
year.
Vulcan activities center around the
chapter room which is located in the
Union Tower on the fifth floor. Since the
group consists of seniors who are active
in other organizations, it is natural that
a great deal of time is spent in discuss-
ing problems and projects for both the
Engineering School and the whole cam-
pus. However, since the group is an Hon-
orary, no public stand is taken on any
issue.
Each fall and spring Vulcans sponsor
student trains to the East and to Chicago.
Fares are provided at a reduced rate be-
cause of the large group. In the past Vul-
can funds have been used to buy T.V.
sets for the Hospital, Furniture for the
smoking room in the West Engineering
basement, and to provide support for the
Honor Council and the Steering Commit-
tee. At the present time there are Vulcan
funds set aside for a scholarship and to
help other groups who are in need of
temporary assistance.
The Vulcan social calendar is an im-
portant part of the group's activity. Each
year several parties are held and every
June the Vulcans end their college life
with a steak fry.

DID YOU EVER
WONDER?
by BOB BRANDZEL
. . . What is the origin of the dollar
sign?
When the United States was formed,
the dollar was adopted as its unit of
coinage, and the sign for the new coin
was taken from the old Spanish piece of
eight. The sign showed the figure 8
(which resembles the letter S), crossed
by two lines representing the Pillars of
Hercules, the gateway between the Medi-
terranean and Atlantic at the southern-
most tip of Spain. Thus was formed the
dollar sign ($). It had nothing to do
with the letter S, nor was it originally
formed by placing a narrow U over an S
to form the monogram of the United
States, as some people believe.
. , . Why we call the United States
"Uncle Sam"?
A contractor named Elbert Anderson
was furnishing some supplies for the
United States Army during the War of
1812. On the barrels were stamped his
initials E. A., and U.S. for the United
States. Someone asked what the letters
meant, and for a joke he said they meant
"Elbert Anderson and Uncle Sam," mean-
ing Samuel Wilson, who was the local in-
spector of army supplies. The term spread
rapidly all over the country. He was pic-
tured as a tall, slender old gentleman with
a thin beard and old-fashioned clothes
and a tall white or gray hat. The tradi-
tional American Flag clothes were adopt-
ed when he became a national figure
about 1840.
. . . Where the name "Dixie" came
from?
Amazingly enough, "Dixie's land" is
in the North, not in the South. A kindly
slave-owner named Dixie who had a plan-
tation in New York sold his slaves to a
Southern cotton-planter when slavery was
forbidden in the North. His former slaves
talked so much of "Dixie's land," where
they had been happy, that it came to be
regarded as a sort of paradise. When
D. D. Emmett wrote the song Dixie, he
may not have known "Dixie's land" was
in the North, or he may have thought the
song would have more appeal if it were
placed in the South, but at any rate, the
song became popular, and we now refer
to Dixie as the South.

INDUSTRY
by PROFESSOR F. N. MENEFEE
What effects will the St. Lawrence Seaway have on Michigan
industry?
After 30 years or more of discussion
pro and con, 30 years of planning for and
estimating the costs thereof, the St. Law-
rence Seaway bill was signed by President
Eisenhower on May 6, 1954. The treaty
with Canada for a non-toll Seaway had
been rejected by the U. S. Senate in 1934,
although Canada had just completed the
rebuilding of the Welland Canal for the
4th time, to the specifications called for in
the present plans, and at a cost to Canada
of $132,000,000. The physical features of
the present proposed project are practi-
cally the same as previously submitted.
The outstanding difference between the
approved plan and those preceding lies in
the provision for tolls to be charged;
sufficient in amount to pay costs for oper-
ation, maintenance and amortization with-
in fifty years.
The bill provides for the "creation of
the St. Lawrence Seaway Development
Corporation, to construct part of the St.
Lawrence seaway in the United States ter-
ritory in the interest of National Secur-
ity." It authorizes "the Corporation to
make certain arrangements with the St.
Lawrence Seaway Authority of Canada
relative to the construction, and operation
of the Seaway—on a self-liquidating
basis"—and authorizes "negotiations with
Canada of an agreement on tolls." There
will be two locks of about 47 foot lift
with approaches 27 feet deep and 80 feet
wide. There will also be a control dam
48 miles upstream with one lock.
The tolls and self-liquidating feature
of the plan are tremendously important
in the writer's mind. A precedent has
been established which will undoubtedly
influence future legislation in connection
with financing of waterways—the prece-
dent may have come too late to affect
the passage of a measure by the House
and Senate authorizing the deepening of
the Delaware river to 40 feet in order
that the new large capacity ore boats
coming from South America can reach
the new U. S. Steel plant at Morrisville,
Pa., just above Philadelphia.
However, news reports indicate that
President Eisenhowevr tried to invoke the
precedent, in part at least. Of the
$91,000,000 estimated cost, he is report-
ed to have asked that local interests pay
$18,000,000. Senator Edward Martin,
chairman of the Senate Public Works
Committee succeeded in getting the au-
thorization approved with no contribu-
tion by local beneficiaries. But, the au-
thorization carries with it no appropria-
tion and it may be that before an appro-
priation is made the precedent set by the
Seaway may be invoked in part at least.
The requirement of the users of the
Seaway to pay operation costs, mainten-
ance and amortization charges is a de-
parture from the old theory "that what
helped one large area strengthened the
national economy and was a legitimate
federal charge." It was a concession to
the opposition, which claimed the nation
should not be taxed for a benefit to the
Great Lakes Basin. It is believed that the
public likes the idea of requiring such
projects to be self-supporting; if so, we
may see more and more of this new pol-
icy with the passage of time. In the case
of the Seaway the writer believes the
abandonment of the old theory was fully
justifiable.
Immediately upon final approval re-
quests started coming in to the Seaway
Development Corporation for changes in
plans. For the most part these requests
wanted locks 100 feet wide instead of
80 feet; and 1000 feet long instead of
800 feet; and lock and channel depths of
35 feet instead of 27 feet as planned. The
request had to be denied because the
$100,000,000 appropriated in the Seaway
bill was based on estimates for locks 80
feet wide by 800 feet long by 27 feet
deep.
The psychology regarding the Seaway
has swung from opposition to extreme en-
thusiasm in many cases, usually with per-
sons who were not properly oriented in
their thinking, either before or after the
Seaway Bill's approval.
We heard for instance that the impact
of the Seaway on economics of the Great
Lakes area would equal that of the advent
of the automobile. Lets look at this one;
5,000,000 cars a year at $2,000 per car
equals $10,000,000,000. 50,000,000 tons
passing Seaway, paying its own way and
saving $10 a ton to business in the Great
Lakes area is a saving of $500,000,000—
not a brand new shot-in-the-arm of
$10,000,000,000. We will not, however,
with the presently proposed Seaway, get
50,000,000 new tons of freight-saving
cargo through the various sets of locks.
Some experts believe that when the chips
are down, taking into account cargo car-
rying tonnage of even the larger boats
contemplated, the amount of iron ore
tonnage expected, the time required for
locking boats through the Welland, and
many other factors, the actuaJ new ton-
nage entering the upper lakes will not be
more than 25 or 30 million annually—
saving perhaps $250,000,000 or $300,-
000,000 annually to Great Lakes industry,
plus paying for the improvements in the
international section of the river. Besides
paying for the improvement, we may
save to industry 200 to 250 million dol-
lars annually. This fully justifies the Sea-
way, but it is hardly an impact, nor is it
going to bring in $10,000,000,000 of
new money.
This new business will not be distrib-
uted evenly by the ten major ports that
will compete for it, but any port getting a
million tons of new export business will
prosper.
What is Michigan doing? Michigan's
constitution provides for port organiza-
tion and means for financing. We have a
State Department of Economic Develop-
ment which keeps track of industrial

RECENT RESEARCH shows that nonionic surface-

hold on to it longer. Hercules nonionics, now being

printing jobs off on schedule. For every type of printing requirement—whether it be
high speed or specialized—there's a Hercules resin or lilm-former to assist the ink
maker in achieving the best possible formulation for the purpose.

of water, acid or alkali, paints based on Hercules Parlon® (chlorinated rubber) give
longer service at lower long-term cost.

having the student use the knowledge
he has derived from one course in an-
other. Breaking down some of the
barriers in experimental training is
corollary to this philosophy.
Conclusion
There cannot be an argument that
broad research training is impossible in
an undergraduate curriculum. To say this
is to say that there can be no proper
scientific training at all. A four-year train-
ing in which the equations and numbers
in the handbooks are "given" goes so far
in molding the student's attitude that it
would take 4 more years to break it. It
would be better to sacrifice the amount
that the student learns in favor of a con-
structive use of his knowledge.
The important factor in the design of
an experimental course is an apprecia-
tion of the students' level. The under-
graduates are untrained, unskilled, and
unmotivated. The undergraduate must
develop a body of special techniques.
These points stipulate the care which must
be exercised in designing the program—
they do not argue that the program is
impossible.
A Proposal
We propose a research laboratory pro-
gram for Science Engineering students
to be conducted in the Junior and Senior
years. There should be ample provision
for time to be spent in the laboratory—
perhaps at the expense of some of the
formal credit hours which we are pro-
posing. It has been argued above that the
curriculum is probably out of balance in
favor of formal teaching.
There should be more than the usual
staff to conduct the program, perhaps
three staff members with different back-
grounds attached to the laboratory, plus
skilled graduate student assistance. The
instruction should be of the advisory and
consulting type, and the students should
be encouraged toward independent work.
The choice of experimental topics
should not be guided by practical reasons
of comprehensive training or of possible
application. The best experiments will be
those which illustrate the problems of re-
search and which have reasonable scope.
The experiments should be for the most
part extraordinarily simple, and should
not require complex apparatus. The
"black box" or "block-diagram" approach
to research should be avoided.
The laboratory should foster a do-it-
yourself approach. It would be appro-
priate to attach a small machine shop to
the laboratory so that simpler parts can
be made by the student himself. It is
here that the choice of a particular ma-
terial or operation for a job begins to
count. On the other hand, the students
should be able to go to the main shops
for apparatus which requires special skill
in construction.
Suggestions for Experimental Topics:
1. Measurement of lengths. Formulate
and execute a measurement of the dis-
tance to the moon. (Use apparatus
from the Surveying Department.)
2. Construct a sensitive galvanometer
which may not have a good linear
scale, but whose limitations are dic-
tated by noise. (A quartz thread and
a permanent magnet.)
3. Construct a crude oscilloscope. (A
bent-wire gun in a bell jar, and a
phosphor-coated metal collector).
Measure e/m of the electron.
4. Measure pumping speed in a vacuum
system. Measure the vacuum and
study the limitations in speed and
ultimate vacuum in a practical sys-
tem. (A set of pumps and a one-
tube ion gauge.)
5. Measure the formative time and error
in timing in a spark in an automobile
spark plug. (Equipment: power sup-
ply and an oscilloscope).
6. Study the effect of a radioactive
source on pumping (or super-heat-
ing) in the boiling process. (A beak-
er of water and a small cobalt
source.)
7. Construct an ultra centrifuge and
measure its rotational speed. (A ro-
tator driven by an air jet, a mirror,
photocell, and oscilloscope.)
8. Measure the weight of the earth.
(Construct a Cavendish balance.)
9. Construct an electrolytic cell and
measure the Faraday charge.
10. Make sodium chloride. (Topic in
crystalization.)
11. Construct and use a distillation col-
umn.
12. Prepare a plastic material—study in
polymerization.
13. Measure Avogadro's number. (Elec-
trolysis of gases, measurement of gas
density.)
Reasons for this Selection of Experiments
1. They are simple and require very
little commercial apparatus.
2. They can be done in a few days or
weeks at most. (The students must
avoid getting bogged down in de-
tails.)
3. The potential errors are really enorm-
ous.
4. There are abstract as well as intense-
ly practical problems.
The attitude of this report is that a set
of experiments can be found and devised
which can be performed at the under-
graduate level. It is also assumed that,
once an experiment is performed, the
apparatus will be dismantled and sal-
vaged for parts, preferably by the stu-
dents. Finally, the experiments are of no
intrinsic value in themselves but are sim-
ply vehicles for student training. There is
no attempt to "cover" a field.
A set of mandatory first experiments
should be adopted which will require
gluing, soldering, simple work on drill
press and lathe, and so on, so that a back-
log of skills and techniques may be built.
These techniques should not be taught by
themselves but rather in context with a
real, but simple, experimental problem—
one in which the data taking may only
require five or ten minutes.
Also some formal training should be
planned which would parallel the labora-
tory and would cover the general aspects
of experimental practice. These would
include the techniques of reducing data,
the reporting of systematic and statistical
errors. This course should underscore the
meaning and importance of errors and
make it evident that either an under-
estimate or overestimate of error destroys
the significance of an experimental datum.
These are general research topics which
are not in the province of any particular
field, and which should be incorporated
in the general research course.
Summary
This report presupposes the importance
of research training to all Science Engi-
neering students. Whether a man goes
into the professional research field or
not, his use of an Engineering background
will always bring him into contact with
research problems. Also, if his formal
training is to serve him at all, it is
necessary that he have an active under-
standing of basic research.
The type of laboratory problems, and
the illustration of possible problems
which have been set forth, are given
here only as guides which may stimulate
the development of a workable research
course.

you might call "career status," and get
out of the "job status"? It varies with
people, but it may take two or three years.
It's a shame for him to come in and then
after a year move on, or even after a few
months move to another place. After he
moves two or three times he begins to
look like a "pob hopper'". Employment
stability is important from many stand-
points. The student should carefully se-
lect his first employer and then decide to
stay there until he has learned from that
employer all of the experience that he
can. He should carefully select a good em-
ployer and stick to that job until he gets
an understanding of that company. Then
he can judge whether or not it is a good
place—whether or not he wants to stay.
He has a greater stake in the future if
he stays where he is, becoming integrated
as a member of the organization.
Another important requirement is the
ABILITY OF SELF-EXPRESSION. That
of course takes many forms. Many good
ideas are lost because the originator can-
not express or transfer his ideas convinc-
ingly and understandingly. One of the
means of self-expression is written expres-
sion. In some respects the written expres-
sion is easier because one can write, read,
and change; one can alter—we work with
a sentence and change it until satisfied.
But the spoken word makes its impression
and you can't rework it. Another means
of self-expression that is important to the
engineer is his ability to convey pictorially
what he is thinking. That calls for an
ability of layout and ability to work with
lines and to imagine three-dimensionally
and depict in two dimensions. Thus he
needs the ability to do that so that his
layouts of design and ideas can be con-
veyed to draftsmen for completion as
drawings. All should have an understand-
ing of the simple principles of descriptive
geometry so that they don't get confused
the first time they have to rotate and find
true lengths of lines and intersections of
planes. They should understand that be-
fore they leave college, but more as a
graphic art than as a drawing procedure.
Sketching is also a very helpful device in
conveying ideas. Some ideas get so com-
plex that a simple sketch helps greatly in
conveying the idea.
The whole field of self-expression is
important. It is one of those that can be
taught. Somehow the student should gain
some skills in this field and learn their
importance. Whether they gain these skills
in college or whether they gain them
afterwards is unimportant. They should
know that they are a part of their "kit
of tools." They are part of the specifica-
tion for an ultimately successful engineer.
ABILITY TO RECOGNIZE THE
PROBLEM is to a degree inherent in a
person. It is a part of his intelligence, lets
say, but it is also something that can be
developed consciously as a part of the
process of education. In industry one may
not even know a problem exists. You've
got to be suspicious that one does. Many
problems are so intangible that the final
recognition of it is as much a triumph
as its solution. The boss doesn't bring
them a problem and say, "Solve this." He
gives them a job to do and they have got
to find their "problems" and lick them.
The ability to recognize, isolate, define a
problem, and then proceed with its solu-
tion is an important one. To find out what
your ultimate purpose is, is important.
Another necessary attribute is SENSE
OF PROPORTION. The ability to dis-
criminate between the important and the
less important, the urgent and the less
urgent, the crusade and just a trip. Some
conditions have important influence upon
a person's future and some do not. Some
things are important to the quality and
safety of a product and some are not. As
an illustration: Redesign of a single part
to save a small amount of weight would
not be important unless it is one part of
many in an over-all weight reduction pro-
gram.
MORAL INTEGRITY is a require-
ment. The engineer's fellow men, includ-
ing his supervisor, must have complete
confidence in his integrity. His security
classification depends upon honesty and
integrity. Without these he cannot retain
cleared status. Without clearance he can-
not work on classified matter. Of course,
in the final analysis he must have these
characteristics if he is to enjoy living with

formance with a minimum of maintenance. This was the
problem facing Manning, Maxwell &amp; Moore's team of
electric hoist designers. They solved a big part of it by
installing dependable, Fafnir Ball Bearings at every pos-
sible source of friction — on the rope drum, trolley
assembly, gear shafts, and other critical turning points.
The ready availability of precision anti-friction ball

Powerama is definitely a new type of
public show. Never before has a big effort
been made to familiarize the general pub-
lic with the uses and workings of such a
technical item as the Diesel engine. It
also provided an opportunity for engi-
neers to see many new uses of old stand-

costs are much less, resulting in an esti-
mated cost of between 5 and 7 mills per
kilowatt hour in 100-200 negawatt power
stations. There are good expectations for
capital costs to decrease very soon thus
further reducing the cost of electricity.
Even with present costs, atomic power sta-
tions would be economically competitive
with power stations of a conventional
type in many areas of the world where
power costs are high."
In Bhabha's words, "It is the unanim-
ous view of all concerned that this Con-
ference has succeeded beyond all hopes
and expectations."
The scientists present were in unani-
mous agreement on this and one other
point. At least three years of work should
be allowed before another conference of
this magnitude could be justified.
To be an efficient scientist is not
enough. Adeptness in logic and mathe-
matics will not suffice. Today's executive
must be a person able to see beyond the
job at hand and comprehend the full
implications of all the factors involved.
He must have "native intelligence" so
as to understand not only the job he is
doing, but also the people under him.
The engineer who is a veritable genius
in his particular field of endeavor but
virtually ignorant of social amenities and
the human side of life, is almost worth-
less as an executive.
Thusly did Mr. William C. Porter,
Manager Training Program Director for
the Chrysler Corporation, state the gen-
eral qualifications of a successful engin-
eer-executive. Mr. Porter was speaking
on the subject "How an Engineer Can
Become an Executive" at the packed
smoker of Sigma Rho Tau, an engineer-
ing public speaking society, on the eve-
ning of Tuesday, October 4, in the
Michigan Union. Also on hand was
Prof. T. M. Sawyer, the society's faculty
advisor, members of the society, and
prospective members.
Mr. Porter himself was the very per-
sonification of his topic. He graduated
from Kenyon College in 1949 and went
to work for Chrysler as an engineer.
Within five years he had worked himself
up to a managerial position within the
corporation.
Due to the much-increased complexity
William C. Porter addressing

Tau's annual Smoker for inter-
ested engineers.
of maintaining a large corporation, or-
ganizations which formerly operated
smoothly under the direction of a few
men "at the top," find that they can no
longer retain this outmoded system. But
not enough executives are available to
fill positions in industry. Therefore they
must be trained. They must be taught to
apply their knowledge of a limited field
in relation to the whole corporation.
Mr. Porter outlined the three basic
methods that industries utilize to culti-
vate executives: (1) Attaching a younger
man as an assistant to an elderly execu-
tive so that the young man will have
learned the fundamentals of the position
by the time his superior retires. (2)
Holding special classes on the job for
the purpose of giving the potential execu-
tve a clear picture of the whole corpora-
tion. This is also accomplished by placing
the engineer in different jobs in diverse
facets of the industry. (3) A more recent
development has been to send the gradu-
ate engineer back to college to study only
fine arts and the humanities. This pro-
cedure is rapidly increasing in popularity
because it results in educating the "whole
man" which, in turn, results in executives
of a much better quality.
Today as never before, opportunities
for the engineer to advance to executive
positions are practically unlimited. If the
engineer can meet the requirements, it is
almost inevitable that he will someday be
offered a position of responsibility.

himself, to say nothing of his fellows.
Now in HUMAN RELATIONS so
much has been said that I hesitate to open
the subject because it is good for unlimit-
ed discussion. But the important thing is
that the student should recognize before
he leaves college that he is going out into
an element of society of which he will
become a part. It is not a group of ma-
chines—not a group of buildings—but it
is a group of people. Most of these people
with whom he is to become associated
have been there for some time. They have
made their spot. He had better come in
and recognize that he has got to get along
with that group. He can be as aggressive
as he chooses, but let him behave in a
way that the group accepts, and not in a
way that creates a negative reaction of the
group. In the interest of self-preserva-
tion, let him recognize that he cannot
come in with the idea of converting the
group or the company. If necessary, he
should tolerate behavior he doesn't like
on the part of others and not try to con-
vert them. He had better amalgamate with
the group and recognize that it is rela-
tively inflexible insofar as his immediate
influence is concerned.
The engineer must have EMOTIONAL
CONTROL UNDER PRESSURE. He is
going to be under all sorts of pressure
here as he goes up the ladder of experi-
ence and the pressures become greater
and greater. From time to time he will
feel pressures that will keep him from
sleeping at night and keep him from eat-
ing right. They will bother him. He will
get into design or other trouble condi-
tions in which he feels no one else ever
suffered as he is suffering. He is becom-
ing an engineer when he gets into that
condition. His behavior under those con-
ditions of pressure is important. The boss
may seem irrational at times, but remem-
ber, the boss is also under some terrific
pressure. Difficult conditions are set up
both timewise and performancewise, and
under those conditions good engineering
performance is necessary and good stabil-
ity is necessary. Emotional control under
pressure of all sorts should be recognized
as a necessary attribute.
Another attribute one should develop is
ENERGY AND ENTHUSIASM FOR
THE JOB. It is easy to feel thus toward
interesting assignments in the specific
field of interest and education. The prob-
lem exists in the case of those assign-
ments which are not so freshly interesting
and challenging but which must be done.
There are also many jobs outside the basic
field of interest which may in fact be
completely foreign to the person's back-
ground and interest, but within his apti-
tudes. These assignments can be very in-
teresting if approached with energy, en-
thusiasm, and an inquiring attitude. They
can be dull and boring if approached
otherwise. Obviously, the job performance
is going to be determined to some extent
by the attitude of approach. There are
many reasons why the interested, enthu-
siastic approach should be made. It is the

ELECTRICITY...
INDISPENSABLE INGREDIENT
OF PROGRESS
Progress would be forced to take faltering steps without
energy in the tremendous quantities demanded by our
growing population and the industries which serve it.
Low-cost electrical energy—on tap at all times and for
all purposes—has made possible tremendous strides for-
ward in virtually every area of human endeavor.
Unquestionably, the steady, rapid growth of the electric
industry is a basic source of strength which has contributed
to America's phenomenal progress. Today, that strength is
being increased at a greater rate than ever before. In the
past ten years the electric industry has more than doubled
its capacity to produce. You may expect a further increase
in generating capacity to about 300 million kilowatts in
just 15 more years—up some 200 per cent over 1954—
with all the attendant industrial growth and progress that
this expansion implies. Few other industries have the
intense drive toward technological improvement that typi-
fies the utilities—a drive that has made cheap and abun-
dant electricity possible. In recognizing and shouldering
their responsibility by investing a large share of income,
year after year, in development and expansion, America's
electric companies are helping to make more and better
products for more and more people. This is progress.

the new Magne-Dash autoclave in Standard Oil's Whiting research laboratory.
Orders for inventions taken here
Modern research creates a need for brand-
new types of equipment. In petroleum labora-
tories, mixing up some stuff in a beaker usually
isn't the answer. The research pioneer may
have to use high temperatures and high pres-
sures. If he must stir his mixture, he has a
tough job. How can he prevent leakage past
the shaft of the stirrer?
To meet this and other difficult situations,
Standard Oil has set up a "Special Devices
Program". A group of scientists creates the
apparatus needed to solve today's problems.
An example is the Magne-Dash* autoclave.
It has a magnetically operated agitator, and
no external moving parts. Leaks cannot occur.
Research men now use freely the high pres-
sures that lead to new plastics and other new
products.
Like many other inventions made by Stand-
ard Oil scientists to solve our own problems,
the Magne-Dash is licensed for production and
sale by a maker of scientific equipment.
The Special Devices Program is just one of
the creative activities at Standard Oil. Young
scientists find it stimulating to work in such
an atmosphere.

changes, additions and withdrawals, and
so far as they can, to ferret out what is
contemplated.
Large business organizations, for the
most part, have economic survey experts
whose job it is to plan the future de-
mands for their products in quantity and
locality of consumption or market. This
is true of steel, power, telephone, cement,
chemical and associated business. The
Department of Economic Development
reports:
1. A $68 million revival of the copper
industry in the northern peninsula.
2. A $100 million bridge is being built
across the Straits.
3. Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan and On-
tario, are planning a $20,000,000
bridge.
4. Our Governor and State Highway are
discussing ways and means of financ-
ing a billion and a quarter dollars for
a proposed 2,000 mile of divided
four-lane highways, a part of which
would complete the expressway from
Detroit to Chicago.
5. Industrial plants that moved into
Michigan between January and Octo-
ber, 1954, were:
a.) Hehr Manufacturing Co., Los
Angeles to Chesaning (window
frames).
b.) Benson Optical Company, Min-
neapolis to Escanaba.
c.) National Container Corp., New
York to Detroit (corrugated
boxes).
d.) E. I. Dupont de Nemours, Wil-
mington, Del., to Montague
($11/^ million plant).
e.) Union Carbide and Carbon Co.,
New York to Montague ($2
million plant).
f.) Bituminous Materials Co., Terre
Haute, Ind., to Bay City.
g.) Beech Nut Packing Co., Canajo-
hanie, N.Y. to Three Rivers.
h.) C. C. Moore, Inc., Toledo, Ohio
to Blissfield (fiber glass).
i.) Penn. Products, Ohio to Utica
(painting sets.)
j.) H. A. Clark Perforating Co., Ro-
chester, N.Y. to Milan (perfor-
ating metal).
k.) Acme Protection Equipment Co.,
Chicago to South Haven (safety
equipment).
1.) Cupples Door and Frame Co., St.
Louis to Dowagiac.
m.) Ipsen Log Construction Co.,
Rockford, 111. to L'Anse.
n.) Wizard Boat Co., Costa Mesa,
Calif, to St. Joseph.
o.) Adams Engineering Co., South
Bend, Ind. to Three Rivers.
p.) Angwall Fisheries, Marinette,
Wis. to Menominee.
q.) Ironrite, New York to Mt.
Clemens.
r.) The Continental Motors Corp. is
planning a new $7,500,000 jet
engine plant at Muskegon.
s.) The S. D. Warren Co. of Bos-
ton, having acquired the Central
Paper Co. of Muskegon, plans on
spending $18,000,000 on new
facilities.
t.) The Thompson Products Co. of
Cleveland, an automotive sup-
plies company, recently spent
$2,000,000 on a Muskegon
County plant.
u.) With Perfect Circle moving into
Muskegon, that city is now the
piston ring capital, with Perfect
Circle, Sealed Power and Muske-
gon Piston Ring Co.
Muskegon has a good port that can be
expanded, a port authority, and in 1953
its waterborne domestic and foreign ton-
nage amounted to 3,500,000 tons.
By no means offsetting the foregoing,
a few firms moved from Michigan to
other states. One of these was the Hud-
son Motor Car Co., from Detroit to
Kenosha, Wis. But within the dates
mentioned, the total list of removals all
remain in the Great Lakes Industrial
basin, except one small plant employing
six to twelve persons which went to Cali-
fornia for personal reasons—not for eco-
nomic advantage.
The Detroit Edison Company, after an
exhaustive economic survey, has just built
a $75,000,000 expansion north of Detroit
on Lake St. Clair.
The Peerless Cement Company just
bought a site on the River Rouge (navi-
gable) for a $7,000,000 additional plant,
for which they paid better than $20,000
an acre for the land.
The Consumers' Power Company is
adding a 180,000 horse-power to its
240,000 horse-power plant near Muskegon
in anticipation of the demand from the
Dupont and Union Carbide plants with
their fifty satellite plants near Muskegon.
Thus, a one-time saw mill town is now
the "hub of a potential $100,000,000
chemical empire."
Sixty percent of the big three auto ex-
pansion has been in Michigan, but for the
most part the remaining 40 percent is still
in the Seaway area where cheap transpor-
tation of coal, iron, limestone and other
raw materials and finished products may
be had.
The State has a Governor's Advisory
Committee of about fifty persons repre-
senting industry, labor and education.
The city of Detroit has a planning com-
mission and a Regional Planning Com-
mission which takes in all of Wayne
County in which Detroit is located, and
parts of three adjacent counties. Of the
work of this planning commission, I
quote from Walter Blucher, Executive-
Secretary of the American Society of Plan-
ning Officials: "There is nothing in the
United States to compare with the Re-
gional Plan now in operation in Detroit.
It is the best program now in effect in any
metropolitan city." Supplementing the
foregoing is the Port of Detroit Commis-
sion—Troy Browning, David Lowe, Ferris
Fitch, Alvin McCauley, Jr.
These various agencies are studying
every phase of industry, including real
estate and retail marketing, but are not
neglecting the educational and cultural
needs of the region.
Following are some of the major im-
provements and house-cleaning jobs:
Detroit's expressway program began in
September 1944, with a tri-party agree-
ment, between the State, Wayne County,
and the City. The first right of way was
bought in October, 1945. Plans were
drawn from 1945 to 1947 when construc-
tion began on a pay-as-you-go plan. It was
soon evident that this method was going
to be too slow. In 1950, Mayor Cobo pro-
posed financing with bonds backed by
the State, County and City.
The main surface arteries leading from
the heart of Detroit outward are well built
up for 10 to 12 miles, with the usual
number of stop lights. While the express-
ways are not finished, the author went
from downtown Detroit to his office in
Ann Arbor, a distance of 42 miles, a few
days ago in 51 minutes via the John C

profession. They supply tests and questionnaires to aid in
selecting and counseling students who wish to go into engin-
eering. These efforts, although aimed toward building stronger
professional societies, face difficulties because of the conditions
thus far.
The engineer working in a highly organized society certainly
needs some form of organizational representation. Other
professional men have strong professional societies to protect
them; production workers have unions to represent them;
and employers and manufacturers have associations to aid
them. Economic security rightfully belongs to the engineer as
well. He has invested a great deal of time and expense in
training, and as he gains experience in a firm his worth to
the productive process increases. //, as indicated in the above
analysis, it is difficult or impossible for the model of the
professional society to achieve status and security for the
engineer, the model of the industrial union should be utilized,
for no organizational backing the engineering profession will
fall behind.
The aims of a union are not antagonistic to professional
development. As pointed out earlier, membership in a union
is a contractual agreement between individuals working in a
certain plant or locality to achieve certain goals which are of
benefit to all members. Unions do not replace the services
professional societies can give their members. Professional
societies can continue, even if strong unions exists, to develop
professional standards. Without a doubt unions would benefit
from such developments, since they are concerned with
maintaining job standards. Enlightened management has
realized that unions have aided in raising the standards of
their work force. As stated in the preamble of many labor
contracts, the purpose of the contract is to stabilize labor
and management relations.
A union may even aid in the professional development of
engineers by creating an atmosphere of security and by re-
ducing destructive competition between engineers. Where men
work at similar jobs in the same organization with a common
purpose, competition usually impedes progress and does not
permit the individual to utilize his full creative abilities.
Furthermore, other barriers limiting close relations between
engineers might be removed.
As always, speculation can best be backed by experiment.
Experiments in unionism are and have been occurring. Teach-
ers have both a union and a professional society, The American
Federation of Teachers and the National Education Associa-
tion. Engineers need not even go to another profession for
they have the American Federation of Technical Engineers.
This organization has increased its membership by over 70
percent in the last seven years. In a particular local, the
Minneapolis Federation of Honeywell Engineers, over 1100
of the engineering force of 1500 are claimed as members. In
a strike earlier this year only 158 nonmembers crossed the
picket line. Evidently this union has proven sufficiently valu-
able to the engineers at Minneapolis Honeywell for fewer
than half of even the non-members to be willing to oppose
union aims.
With objective study of these examples and many other
instances around the country, engineers can better understand
the role unions play in their profession and can be guided in
building organizations which will achieve greater economic
security and advancement for all engineers.

YOU FIND THE BEST JOB SUITED TO YOUR TRAINING
D,
'iversity of technical skills required
by Allison in the design, development
and production of turbo-jet and turbo-
prop engines offers a wide range of op-
portunities to young graduate engineers.
And, the Advanced Educational Fa-
cilities help the young graduate find the
work best suited to his academic training
and liking.
For instance, there's Wayne Mclntire
(above) Mechanical Engineer, Purdue
University, who came to Allison upon
graduation in 1950. After completing the
training program, Wayne now is doing
the kind of work he wanted, and is tech-
nically qualified to handle. He is Project
Engineer, mechanical design of gea r
boxes. He is shown making an adjust-
ment on the propeller linkage control on
the cutaway model of the Allison T56
aircraft engine. This, incidentally, is
America's first production turbo-prop
engine, and is used in the Lockheed C-130
Hercules, a 54-ton transport. The Allison
Model 501, which is the commercial ver-
sion of the military T56, is the powerful
turbo-prop engine proposed for com-
mercial airline use.
In his present job, Wayne works on
initial design ... helps decide what com-
ponents—such as propeller brakes,
accessory drives, oil pumps, etc.—are
needed for the specific project.
The nature of Allison business con-
tinually presents a variety of interesting
and challenging problems to the engi-
neering staff, which—along with the

SKY HOOK...
Here is a hook for a hoist—mankind's sinew-sparing
servant... as industrially indispensable as its load-lifting
applications are limitless.
Hoists lift steel beams for buildings and bridges, raise
and lower drills and casing for deep-driven oil wells, lift a
bucket of cold water from a country well or a ladle of
molten metal in a mill. . . lighten load-lifting chores for
machinists and miners, loggers and longshoremen, farm-
ers and factory workers.
HOW MAHY KIHDST
Consider the many kinds of hoists in use today ... reeved
with rope, cable, chain . . . powered pneumatically, man-
ually, electrically . . . engineered with gears, pulleys,
pistons, ratchets.
Think how many millions of plans, sketches, models
and mock-ups have contributed to their evolution. The
eyes of a myriad of inventors, engineers and draftsmen
have appraised them. The hands of countless pattern-
makers, tool and die makers, machinists and other
craftsmen have shaped them.
Pulling together is a work method uniquely American.
And, America can work like that because it has an all-
seeing, all-hearing and reporting Inter-Communications
System.
THE AMERICAN INTER-COM SYSTEM...
Complete communication is the function and contribu-
tion of the American business press . . . the industrial,
trade, business and professional publications that are
edited to meet the needs of men in business, science and
industry.
COMMUNICATION IS OUR BUSINESS...
Many of the textbooks in which you are now studying
the fundamentals of your specialty bear the McGraw-
Hill imprint. For McGraw-Hill is the world's largest
publisher of scientific and technical works.
After you leave school, you will want to keep abreast
of developments in your chosen profession. Then one of
McGraw-Hill's many business magazines will provide
current information that will help you in your job.

the challenge
ahead
Industry's demand for lower
costs of manufacture offers a
promising future to the pro-
gressive-minded engineering
graduate.
The machine designer who
knows how to utilize materials
to best advantage will find great
demand for his services. That's
because the cost of material
constitutes a good share of the
ultimate cost of a product.
An efficient machine design is
one that utilizes the fewest
pounds of the least expensive
metal that will give required
service life.
A basic comparison of
materials shows:
1. Steel is 2 to 3 times stronger
than gray iron. Only one-third
the amount of metal is needed
for equal strength in tension.
2. Steel is 2V4 times as rigid as
iron. Only 40% of the amount
of material is needed for equal
rigidity.
3. Pound for pound, steel costs
a third as much as iron.
As a result, when steel is used to
its best advantage, the cost of ma-
terial amounts to approximately
15% of the cost of iron required
for equal rigidity. (40% x Vs)
The large initial saving in ma-
terial cost provides a wide mar-
gin in which to fabricate the
steel and still realize a substan-
tial savings in overall cost.

to keep abreast of rapid develop-
ments in design may obtain lit-
erature on application of welded

Lodge and Edsel Ford expressways. When
finished, these expressways will approxi-
mate 23 miles and will cost about $189
million.
As in the case with all industrial cities,
population expansion of Detroit into
suburban sections surrounding the central
part of the city has taken place at almost
explosive rates. One of the old established
department stores (the J. L. Hudson Co.,
said to be the largest department store in
the United States) has built a shopping
center eight miles northwest of the par-
ent location, with the satellite stores of
every description sufficient to take care of
the consumable goods industry of a fair-
ly large city in itself.
In downtown Detroit, along the River
—up and down which annually passes
millions of tons of raw materials and
manufactured products—a civic center is
under construction which, for beauty and
utility, will be hard to surpass. One build-
ing alone, at present called 'Convention
Hall Exhibits Building" will be 420 by
720 feet, with the roof for a parking lot.
It is anticipated that for a time, at least,
Detroit's convention facilities will out-
class those of any other city in the
country.
Detroit's skid row will undoubtedly be
expunged from the record. Fifty acres
in the vicinity of Gratiot and Orleans
known as Gratiot Orleans Redevelopment
area, but often referred to as skid row
and Ragweed Acres, will shortly be in-
vaded by construction crews, bent on
spending from 20 to 50 million dollars
on an apartment housing and shopping
center. An $18,000,000 parking project
is under consideration.
During 1954, the city of Birmingham,
eight miles northwest of downtown De-
troit, added 207 single houses, 12 two-
family dwellings and three small apart-
ment buildings, aggregating in cost about
$3,800,000.
Plans for a $100,000,000 plus residen-
tial community in an eight square mile
area, about 15 miles northeast of Detroit's
City Hall, have been announced. It is
claimed by its promoters to be the largest
real estate development dollar-wise in
Michigan's history.
Twenty-one miles north of Detroit,
300 houses are being built on a 74-acre
tract, at an estimated cost of $3,500,000.
It will be called Shelby Village.
The Chrysler Corporation was recently
issued a permit to build a $7,000,000 ad-
dition to its plant on Detroit's east side.
A new $20,000,000 Ford hospital has
recently been dedicated, and the Univer-
sity of Michigan will soon have the most
complete medical center in the United
States.
Studies of population trends by Mr.
Swartley, General Statistician with the
American Telephone and Telegraph Com-
pany, show that while the Pacific coast
states had the greatest increase in popula-
tion between 1940 and 1950, Michigan
exceeded the overall average of 14.5 per
cent by 66.67 per cent with a per cent in-
come of 21.2, and the trend seems to be
extending with the present decade.
The best informed opinion is that
the overall outlook for the U.S. indicates
continued growth and that the Great
Lakes area will get better than an average
proportion of that growth. "Maturity of
our economy is not in sight." The Pacific
states may lead us for a time, but the day
is fast approaching when fresh-water sup-
plies, in California anyway, will inhibit
expansion, and cities surrounding the
Great Lakes will forge ahead. For not
only do we have unlimited fresh water
(which, of course, should be carefully
conserved), but we have as said before,
coal, iron, limestone, supporting agricul-
ture, and cheap transportation (not fully
developed), which, excluding iron ore,
will be increased in the St. Lawrence
River and Welland Canal district by 20
to 25 percent with the opening of the
proposed Seaway. The assurance of iron
ore from the Mesabi or from Labrador
will stabilize the steel industry in the
Great Lakes area, and assure its continua-
tion and necessary expansion on a com-
petitive basis with east-coast steel. Since
steel production and consumption is the
industrial foundation upon which our na-
tion-wide economy rests, and since agri-
culture in the Great Lakes area produces,
percentage wise, more than our popula-
tion percentage, let us in the Great Lakes
humbly count our many blessings, plan
wisely, and look with confidence into the
future.
Many factors have entered into this
expanding economy of Michigan, the be-
lief that the Seaway would be approved
and finally the approval started a psycho-
logical or intangible optimism, provided
a catalytic which has been a large factor
in the various ventures herein cited.

U. of M. Graduates Nuclear Engineers
At a time when graduating engineers
are at a premium, four of them from
The University of Michigan could be
among the "most wanted" in the nation.
They are early products of the Univer-
sity's graduate program in Nuclear En-
gineering, one of the first set up to train
the men who will design, construct and
operate the atomic facilities of tomorrow.
Industry has wooed them with offers
of starting salaries up to $7,000 a year
and with promises of swift advancement.
The four are Joseph J. Bulmer of
Troy, N. Y. and Morton R. Fleishman,
New York City, February graduates who
remained another semester to continue
their research; and June graduates Emil
Nicolaysen of Oslo, Norway, and Jerome
L. Shapiro, 13725 Dexter, Detroit.
Possessing backgrounds in aeronautical,
chemical and mechanical engineering, the
four have become familiar with the uses
of nuclear reactors, high energy radiation
sources, and radioactive tracer materials
and techniques.
Individually, they have used U-M fa-
cilities in explorations of such areas as
the sterilization of food and medical
supplies with atomic energy and the effect
of radioactivity on the combustion of
fuels.
"We have tried to encourage the devel-
opment of new and unconventional ideas
on the use of nuclear energy in any of its
forms," reports Dr. Henry J. Gomberg,
chairman of the committee supervising
the program.
Launched in the fall of 1953, the pro-
gram now has 12 other engineers en-
rolled, with a growing number applying
for future admission. Next year they
will begin making use of still another
facility in learning their atomic ABC's
—the University's one-million-watt nu-
clear reactor, now under construction on
the North Campus.
Dozens of firms have offered the grad-
uates beginning salaries ranging to $585
a month, considerably above the level
given engineers with master's degrees in
other fields.
Despite the inducements, all four will
continue their advanced work. Bulmer
and Fleishman are among the 20 students
in the nation selected for admission to
IN THE NEWS
(Continued from page 24)
the exclusive School of Reactor Tech-
nology at Oak Ridge next fall.
An aeronautical engineer, Nicolaysen
plans to work a year on combustion re-
search at the U-M's Aircraft Propulsion
Laboratory. After earning his doctorate
in Nuclear Engineering, he hopes to enter
the aircraft industry.
Shapiro also will continue working
toward his Ph.D. at Michigan. A mechan-
ical engineer, his master's thesis was on
the calculation of the ionization of a
flame front passing through a radioactive
field.
While studying under the Nuclear
Engineering program, Bulmer had an
opportunity to win recognition in his
field through the publication of technical
papers. He was co-author of two papers
on proposed designs for facilities to
irradiate food, and of "A Peacetime Sur-
vey of Nuclear Energy from an Indus-
trial Viewpoint." His "Sterilization of
Medical Supplies with Gamma Radia-
ation" is to be published in the proceed-
ings of the Geneva Convention this sum-
mer.
Fleishman plans ultimately to enter
some phase of theoretical atomic research.
A U-M graduate in aeronautical engineer-
ing, he has conducted studies of flame
speeds under gamma radiation.

Company engineers had the problem
of keeping the cutters on this Stamco

Tapered design lets
Tim ken bearings take both

Because of their tapered design, Timken bearings can
take radial or thrust loads or any combination. And

best way to get any job done quickly
and out of the way. It attracts the coopera-
tion of others. The boss is impressed by
the attitude with which the person attacks
a new situation. Each such assignment is
a chance to learn more about the opera-
tions of the department or of the com-
pany at large. Future advance will be
greatly influenced by such experience.
One can never be certain that new broad-
ening interests will not take place, thus
one should eagerly explore all facts of
the job whenever opportunity presents
itself. Another good reason is that life is
just more interesting when one approach-
es his work with energy and enthusiasm.
One more characteristic I wish to men-
tion as an important one is DECISIVE-
NESS. First, one must know when a deci-
sion is necessary, and second, one must be
able to make the decision. Rarely can one
wait until all facts are known; thus, there
is always the element of chance. The posi-
tion of the person who later kibitzes the
decision is of course far different. He can
always see the decision in a different
light with a different set of facts. It is
important, then, to face the decision with
all the facts and judgment possible. Con-
sider all anticipated effects and possibli-
ties—then have the courage to make the
decision and accept the responsibility.
This is one area in which the college cur-
ricula could probably do very good work
with the case method. Here good appre-
ciation could be introduced for the uncer-
tainties, intangibles, difficulties, hazards,
responsibilities, and consequences of de-
cisions. This is the final point of battle
for the executive. He makes the final de-
cision; he rises or falls on it.
In essence, these cover the elements of
what I could call the "Specification of a
Person." You can see it is intangible and
abstract. Well, so are people, and so is
the judgment of those people. However,
if people can recognize that these ele-
ments, these attributes are consciously
sought by the employer and that the em-
ployee's performance under those at-

tributes is important in his growth and
future, then we have come some way in
trying to define the "Specification of i
Person."
The graduate's record will contain
statements regarding hobbies, outside in-
terests, participation in extra-curricular
activities—all of these are evidence of the
engineer's personality make-up, and indi-
cate to a degree how successful he has
been in making social and progressional
adjustments. Evidence of attempts to be
partially self-supporting, if they show up
during the college period is a desirable
trait.
The engineer's education therefore goes
beyond the relatively narrow bounds of
his curriculum and includes all of the
above-mentioned areas. Proper integra-
tion of these experiences within the in-
dividual together with his ability to con-
vince the interviewer that he would have
reasonable chances for success in the or-
ganization are the considerations behind

SPARK NEEDED!
One of the items on the Engine Council Agenda is
faculty evaluation. Unfortunately, it has been kicked
around for the last six months without anything coming
of it. At the last Engine Council meeting (Oct. 13) a com-
mittee was appointed to further study its possibilities.
Opinions from student and faculty members present were
mostly favorable, however the spark necessary for items
like this seemed to be lacking. The importance of this issue
was brought home to me early this semester when I met
my new teachers. Now, there are several types of teachers;
good, average and poor. They can be further subdivided
into (1) those who work hard and (2) those who just
don't give a dam. Fortunately there are not many of the
latter so we might as well forget about them. I doubt
whether even a flock of dunning evaluations by their
students would shock them out of their lethargy. So to
those who happen to pull one, the only advice I can offer
is to mark it off to experience.
There are many teachers, though, who are definitely
mediocre but try very hard. In spite of intensively exerting
themselves, they never seem to get too much accomplished.
One type spends too much time on unnecessary detail, one
just has a lack of organization and the hour seems to go
by before he figures out what he wants to do, and another's
way of expressing himself leaves much to be desired.
These are all things that the student knows but he can't
simply walk up to a professor and say, "The trouble with
you is .... " and proceed to put his foot in his mouth.
A method must be devised whereby the students can let
the instructor know their sentiments.
This could be done very easily by an unsigned student-
written evaluation of the teacher which would be seen
by that teacher alone, and only after the semester was
over. Thus a student would have no fear of retribution and
the instructor no fear of embarrassment.
Industry has used substantially the same method very
successfully for years in improving relations between super-
visors and the workmen. As a matter of fact, we need go
no further than our own Engineering school for an
example. I had two teachers in the English department
that I, and everyone I've talked to about it, really thought
were tremendous. They, on their own, asked for an evalu-
ation of the course and teacher at the end of the semester.
Continually during the semester they had pointed out
changes in procedure or content that were advocated by
previous evaluation, and were usually very well received by
the class.
After all this don't get me wrong. I do think that the
majority of the instructors are very good, but there is a
substantial number of them who aren't. For the good of
both the student who will benefit from increased knowledge
and the teacher who will benefit from the satisfaction of a
job well done with less effort, I think that the students
should urge their Engine Council representatives and the
professors whom they know to get faculty evaluation
rolling.
Congratula/ions are in order for Professor T. Boyle,
head mentor of the Freshman class, for getting the Fresh-
man Assembly moved from the hard benches and dismal
atmosphere of 348 W. E. to the plush Auditorium A in
Angell Hall and the Lydia Mendelssohn theatre.
Classification was the source of much unnecessary trouble
to a lot of the students I've talked to. Probably the biggest
item was the narrow aisles between departments especially
the one in front of Industrial Engineering. I walked over,
took one look, and decided I'd better get Ron Kramer to
run interference for me. Between the professors from the
department and the Industrial students being taken care
of, there wasn't an inch of passage space. Since my
advisor was in the middle of the aisle, somehow I had to
get there. Well, after jostling about ten people, I finally
got to my advisor. It wouldn't have been so bad except
that as usual I had to make three or four trips before I got
my program settled, thus disturbing both professors and
students en route.
It seems to me that since they have the use of the entire
fourth floor, things like the telephone to Lit. school could
be moved to an adjacent room thus making it possible to
have more room between aisles. Perhaps they could make
this a class project in some Industrial Engineering course.
It certainly isn't an acceptable layout now.

speaks from experience when he says,
"U. S. Steel offers an interesting and
challenging future in a key industry/'
Following graduation with a B.S. de-
gree in 1949, Mr. Hirt went directly
to the Irvin Works of United States
Steel as an operating trainee. U.S.
Steel trainees are given extensive
training as well as practical experi-
ence in many phases of the steel
industry. In this way, they are fully
prepared to accept responsibilities as
they move up. Just 16 months after
starting as a trainee, John Hirt was
advanced to Relief Foreman—Roll-
ing, in the 80" Hot Strip Mill. He
found the job, "one of the most in-
teresting processing sequences in
modern industry."
Two years ago Mr. Hirt was pro-
moted to General Foreman — Hot
Strip Finishing. In this capacity, he
says, "I am responsible for coordi-
nating the many finishing processes
required to produce hot rolled strip."
Mr. Hirt now supervises a labor
force of over 300 men in finishing
45,000 tons of hot sheets and coils
per month. He sees a need for "a
wide range of talents necessary to
fill the great variety of vital jobs in
the steel industry. There's a solid
future in steel," says Mr. Hirt.

"POWER OFF I" Test operations are directed from this central control room, where
special measuring instruments greatly speed up the collection of pump performance
data. That's one way Worthington products are made more reliable by using . . .
...the world's most versatile hydraulic proving ground
When you make pumping equipment that has to stand up and
deliver year after year anywhere in the world, you've got to be sure
it will perform as specified.
That's why we built one of the world's largest hydraulic test
stands at our plant in Harrison, New Jersey. Here, over a half-
acre "lake," we can check the performance of anything from a
fractional horsepower unit to pumps handling over 100,000 gallons
a minute. When you realize there are thousands of sizes and types
of centrifugal pumps alone, you get an idea of the versatility we
had to build into our proving-ground.
Naturally, our new test equipment is a big help to our research
engineers, as well as our customers. Now they get performance
data on products quickly and accurately. Using it, we can save
months, even years, in developing new Worthington fluid and air-
handling devices — equipment for which this company has been
famous for over a century. For the complete story of how you can

HERE'S A PROBLEM
FOR ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS
To protect short transmission lines against severe damage
due to internal short circuits, Detroit Edison normally uses
a pilot wire differential system to activate circuit breakers
and thus stop the flow of electricity along the damaged wires.
This system is technically limited to the protection of rela-
tively short transmission lines.
Longer lines of all overhead construction can be eco-
nomically protected by carrier pilot relaying systems.
However, where there are long composite lines—overhead
lines which go underground and come back overhead again
—variations in line characteristics make it difficult to pre-
select the correct frequency for the usual carrier pilot relay.
How would you determine whether carrier pilot will work
on a composite line? And, if carrier won't work, what
system would you use to protect this type of line construction?

The above problem is typical of those you would en-
counter as a member of Detroit Edison's outstanding
electrical engineering staff. If you can confront and solve
such interesting and diversified problems, you have a
firm foundation for building a successful career.
The future of Detroit Edison is a bright one. Edison's
constant expansion in a thriving industrial area means
more opportunities for you. Why not see our repre-

Old railroad cars come to life in
$2,000,000 Aeronautical Labora-
tory.

spection of the structure
of the University of Michi-
gan's new wind tunnel.
What has happened to America's air
superiority? It was not too long ago
when we in the United States possessed
an aeronautical technology equalled by
none. Recent statements by public offi-
cials, however, indicate that this is not
the case any longer. The U.S.S.R. has
been producing engineers in the past
few years at an accelerating rate to the
point where there is a possibility of our
national security being endangered.
Whereas in 1951 50,000 engineers
were graduated from universities in this
country, only about half this number are
expected to graduate this year. Although
this situation is presently being remedied,
it will be many years before the demand
is met. In a nation such as ours in which
the backbone of national strength is its
technology, such a deficiency in technic-
ally trained people as we now suffer, is
apt to become a liability in this crucial
period of history.
What is happening at the University
of Michigan is indicative of conditions
prevalent all over the country. For ex-
ample, 193 undergraduate students are
enrolled in the aeronautical curriculum.
Of this number, 103 are sophomores, and
it is expected that the following class will
be much larger. The significance of this
is that at least two years will elapse be-
fore the rate of engineer production will
increase to any appreciable extent.
With the increased number of stu-
dents entering aeronautical engineering,
the present facilities are being improved
to help fulfill the need. Therefore a new
area on North Campus is under construc-
tion which will serve as aeronautical
laboratories.
From all indications the construction
of the buildings and wind tunnels will
be completed sometime during November.
It is not until January, however, that the
labs may be expected to begin operation.
Full-scale operations will start a few
months later after various adjustments
have been made and all equipment is
completely installed.
Although these laboratories will pro-
vide excellent conditions for research and
development, it must be emphasized
that their primary role is an educational
one. When completed, the labs will be
staffed almost entirely by students—both
graduate and undergraduate. The main
objective will be to train aeronautical
engineers with research as a secondary
but desirable by-product.
When completed, this project will have
a value of approximately $2,000,000.
This includes construction costs, the value
of the equipment on hand, and also de-
valuation of the equipment given to the
University by the Atomic Energy Com-
mission. Expenses have been minimized
by transporting the present equipment
from Willow Run testing laboratories and
installing it on the north campus site. This
equipment consists of most of the instu-
ments and facilities which were previ-
ously used in the Willow Run supersonic
and propulsion labs.
A unique feature of this project is the
centralized pumping station. This station
contains air compressors which compress
the air and send it through pipes to

centralized operation, maintenance is
simplified to a great extent.
The compressors in the pumping sta-
tion are capable of compressing two tons
of air to a pressure of 3000 pounds per
square inch. Air of this pressure has a
density equal to one-fourth that of water.
Air compressed to this pressure finds
application in both the supersonic and
propulsion laboratories. In the propul-
sion area intensive research will be
done on turbo-jet, ram-jet, and pulse-jet
engines. Much of this research, however,
will be conducted without actually putting
the engines into operation. This will be
accomplished by passing the compressed
air through the jet engines; the air pass-
ing through the various stages of the
engine without actually encountering com-
bustion. This simulated engine run will
actually provide much important data
concerning performance and will simul-
taneously be of more educational value
since the entire operation is simplified.
More efficient at higher supersonic
speeds (Mach 2.0—Mach 2.8) than the
turbo-jet, the ram-jet threatens to render
it obsolete in the race for more and more
speed. Present turbo-jet engines are
practical only up to a certain speed and
require expensive maintenance. The
metallurgical limitations of the internal
parts of the turbo engine are one of the
major factors in the inability of obtain-
ing more speed. The special alloys of
which the turbine blades are manufact-
ured can only withstand temperatures
below 1600°F. Above this, they begin to
deform during operation and must be
replaced at regular intervals. Since higher
speeds result in higher internal tempera-
tures, it is obvious that the internal parts
of the turbo-jet could not withstand very
fast operation.
Since the ram-jet needs no compres-
sors, the metallurgical barrier of the
turbo-jet is no longer present and much
higher speeds may be obtained.
As a standard of comparison, let us
examine various rates of combustion of
different heat-producing machines. This
rate of combustion is found by dividing
the number of B.T.U. produced per
second by the volume of the combustion
chamber in cubic feet. The ordinary
home furnace produces about 2 BTU
per second per cubic foot. For the auto-
mobile's engine, this rate is between 100
and 200. A turbo-jet is able to burn at
a rate of 3000. The ram-jet, however,
attains a rate of combustion equal to
50,000 BTU per second per cubic foot
of combustion chamber under experi-
mental conditions.
Because it has no compressor, the ram-
jet does present problems when it is de-
sired to actually put the engine into oper-
ation. Ordinarily the ram-jet is started
by rocket-launching or by launching it
from another plane while in flight. This
is necessary since the ramjet has no

compressors and the air must be literally
"rammed" into the combustion chamber
before the engine may be put into
operation. By using the compressed air
system, ram-jets may be started in the
laboratory and be used to obtain test data
Another place in which this compressed
air system will be put to advantage is the
supersonic wind tunnel. This tunnel is
situated in the east end of the aerody-
namics lab. Basically, it consists of three
major components. The first is a semi-
cylindrical structure constructed upon a
pentagonal concrete base to the north of
the building. This cylinder is fitted with
a loose fabric covering over the top
opening. When the cylinder is inflated
with air, the fabric assumes the shape of
a hemisphere. As the air leaves the cylin-
der, the fabric is deflated and returned to
its original position.
Two tunnels are connected to this
cylinder. The first is the supersonic
vacuum tunnel, and parallel to it is the
high pressure tunnel. These tunnels pass
through the building where they are con-
nected to the third component. This com-
ponent is actually nine cylindrical steel
tanks. These tanks are interconnected by-
means of a series of pipes which gives
the same result as if there were one large
tank instead of nine small ones.
This is essentially the same set-up as
the Willow Run labs. The nine tanks are
actually former railroad tank cars from
which the wheels and chasis have been
removed. These cars were obtained after
the war from the government which
originally planned to send them to Russia
as a part of Lend-Lease. When the Uni-
versity received them, the cars were
complete—right down to the hammer and
sickle emblazoned on the sides!
By using these railroad cars instead of
constructing one large tank, a consider-
able measure of economy was effected.
When the tunnel is completed, it will
provide the University with excellent
facilities for the training of engineers
well-versed in phenomena occurring
above the sound barrier.
To prepare the tunnel for operation,
dried and filtered air is fed to the fabric-
domed cylinder until it is fully inflat-
ed. This process is reversed on the
nine tanks where virtually all air is re-
moved to form a near perfect vacuum.
At the proper moment, a valve is
opened and all the air rushes from the
cylinder, through one of the testing sec-
tions, and into the vacuum region—all
within a period of a third of a minute.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


It is seldom, however, that the full
twenty second ran will be necessary to
obtain the required data concerning a
particular shape, configuration, or wing
section.
The design of the tunnels is such that
the air travels first through a narrow
section and then into a wider testing
section. In the 4" x 4" tunnel, the Mach
number range is 11-4.0. The 8" x 13"
tunnel develops speeds ranging from
Mach 1.5-4.0 in the test region.
As the valve is opened, the air speeds
through the throat at a rate of either 4
or 2.5 times the speed of sound. In
either case the air passes through a nar-
row section which is located just before
the test section. In this narrow section or
throat, the air's velocity is Mach 1.0. It
then travels into the testing region which
is much wider than the throat. Because
the effects of Bernoulli's theory is re-
versed at supersonic speeds, the air is
greatly accelerated at these regions of
large cross-sectional area. This continues
until either equilibrium is reached in both
ends of the tunnel or the valve is re-
closed.
During the air's journey through the
tunnel, two interesting things happen. If
the hypothetical situation existed where
one could measure the temperature of
the moving air, it would be discovered
that in the Mach 4 region, the temper-
ature was well below —100° F. The air
remains at this temperature only as long
as it is traveling at four times the speed
of sound and varies inversely with the
air's velocity. When the air resumes its
state of rest, it also resumes its original
temperature.
This drop in temperature is explained
by the law of conservation of energy. Air
at zero velocity and normal temperature
has only potential energy. If this same
air is set in motion, its potential energy
of heat has been transformed into kinetic
energy of motion. Therefore, if the law
of conservation of energy is to hold true,
the energy of the heat lost must be equal
to the energy of the motion gained. Thus
the faster we set the air in motion, the
more it will be forced to give up its
heat energy.
It would be impossible, however, to
derive the temperature of the air in mo-
tion experimentally because of the fact
that any type of thermometer would
measure the temperature of the air which
had piled up in front of the instrument
Sections of the wind tunnel being put together for the new lab on North Campus.
due to the drag it offers. Since this air
has lost its energy of motion, naturally
it will have regained its heat energy and
will therefore register a reading differ-
ing little from the original.
The second phenomena which occurs
at these high speeds is when the air
passes through the throat and into the
test region. At this point there is a severe
drop in density from about normal atmos-
pheric to approximately 10% of the
original. This results from the sudden
passing of the air from a narrow cross-
section to a wider area at high speed.
At somewhat lower speeds, the flow of
air will undergo examination in the low-
turbulence runnel. This wind tunnel is
located in the same building as the
supersonic.
The tunnel itself, as can be seen from
the sketch, is in the form of a quadri-
lateral having two long sides and two
shorter sides. It generates a slight taper
which originates in the northeast corner
and continues along the long side until
the next corner. This northeast corner is
the location of the fan which generates
a 180 mile-per-hour wind when operating
at maximum rpm.
The fan is in the form of an eight-
bladed compressor which has a diameter
of ten feet. It is mounted on a shaft
which goes through a streamlined cigar-
shaped pod and through the wall of the
tunnel into a smaller building. This build-
ing serves as a housing for a 1000 horse-
power direct current electric motor which
develops up to 1000 rpm.
Mounted behind the fan on the stream-
lined pod are ten blades aligned in the
direction of the wind flow so as to elim-
inate, or at least minimize, the torque
set up by the rotating blades. This torque,
or spinning motion, of the air is unde-
sirable because it impairs the obtaining of
exact data during experiments.
At each corner of the tunnel are a
number of curved vanes placed vertically
to change the direction of the air with
a minimum of velocity reduction. After
receiving its initial push from the fan,
the air turns two corners and enters a
large chamber. Five thirty-mesh screens
are installed in this chamber to smooth
out the air flow before entering the test
section. This low-turbulance feature aids
in making the tunnel ideal for low-
speed testing.
The main result of low-turbulence is
the constant velocity of the air stream.
In ordinary low-speed laboratories, an
uneven flow of air may result in fluctua-
tions in the velocity by as much as two
and one-half miles per hour above and
below the mean velocity.
After passing through the screens, the
air enters the test section which has a
cross-sectional area 1/15th of the large
chamber. The velocity increases to about

THE BARREL VAULT
SAW TOOTH BARREL VAULTS
SHELL
FOLDED PLATE SHELL
Gaining increasing prominence in the
construction of auditoriums, factories and
other large buildings is the use of thin,
poured concrete roof shells. This struc-
ture developed from the structural slab,
an example of which is a basement floor.
Like the slab, the shell has the ability to
transmit forces simultaneously in more
than one direction. But the shell makes
greater use of this characteristic by di-
recting the forces to the ground or sup-
ports. Builders can use low tensile ma-
terials like concrete by reducing certain
forces, such as tension, through proper
configuration of the slab. In doing this,
the thickness of the shell can successfully
be reduced to less than 1/500 of the
span.
Shells Curved In One Direction
Basically, the simplest roof shell struc-
tures are those with a single curvature.
Among the most common form is the
barrell vault which is in widest useage.
Because its horizontal projection is a
rectangle, this design lends itself ex-
cellantly to the covering of oblong areas.
The majority of the shell roofs used for
covering industrial buildings, auditoriums,
halls and other large floor areas are barrel
vaults, even though rigid end frames are
needed to hold the roof's shape.
THE CORRUGATED SHELL
THE CORRUGATED ARCH

by JOE COX, '57A.&amp;D.
Sawtooth Barrel Vaults are most com-
monly seen on large factories. This type
of roof, which consists of either cylin-
derical barrel sections or irregular bar-
rels, permits good use of natural lighting.
A special type of the barrel is the
FOLDED PLATE SHELL. It lacks the
efficiency of the barrel, but it costs less
to form. This is especially true of small
jobs where the repetition of the roof
line is small.
Incorporated in many design solutions
because of its capacity to act both as a
beam and a cantilever is the Corrugated
Shell. The strength and support derive
from using a series of alternate right and
inverted barrel vaults.
Useful in spanning large areas is the
CORRUGATED ARCH. Because it com-
bines the features of both a corrugated
plane and a plane arch, it is stronger
than either one of them.
Shells Curved In Two Directions
Shells curved in two directions pro-
vide greater stiffness through their shape
alone. Unlike single curved shells, their
surfaces are not developable. Therefore
it is not possible to construct them by
bending a flat sheet.
The Hyperbolic Paraboloid, with its
eye-catching design, attracts attention
from both the layman and the experi-
mester. W. A. Oberork of the Univer
sity of Michigan is currently conducting
research into this type of structure.
Familiar to most is the DOME. It is
the oldest form of the doublecurved shell
and when circular floor plans are used,
it is often the only feasible covering.
Since shell structures feature low cost
of construction, they are receiving in-
creasing attention from builders. The
shell requires a minimum of concrete and
steel reinforcement, resulting in lower
material costs. Thin shells thus represent
one of the most inexpensive methods of
enclosing space. By using concrete, the
cost of maintenance, depreciation and
operation is held to an absolute minimum.
Concrete, being a permanent material,
does not deteriorate and requires less at-
tention than other building substances.
However, the primary consideration in
the use of concrete shells depends more
on erecting the materials than the actual
cost of the steel and concrete itself. As
designs increase in complexity, the costs
of constructing that design also increase.
Construction of Thin Shell Structures
The economical construction of this
shell demands that attention be given to
the aspects of form design, the handling
Attracting the eyes and arousing the
curiosity of those passing through the
University of Michigan campus is the
Architectural Department's experimental
Unistrut building. This structure, a
hyperbolic paraboloid, plays a part in
the research which the University is
conducting into thin shell roof structures.
In view of the interest aroused by this
unique structure, the Technic decided to
publish a report on shell structures.
of the framework and the labor involved.
Repetitive use of forms, (a temporary
structure over which the concrete is
formed,) is perhaps the most important
factor in reduction of costs. The forms
themselves are designed to be simple and
to use the absolute minimum of material.
Only when aesthetic or functional values
dictate, are forms that are unsuitable for
re-use, or forms for shells curved in two
directions desired. Designers also con-
sider the slope of the shell, as forms
which must receive concrete at an angle
of more than 45 degrees are unsuitable
and avoided.
Since the form work of the shell repre-
sents the largest cost of the total con-
struction operation, the handling of the
form work requires speed, safety and
efficiency. For certain shapes, such as the
barrel vault, centering the form over the
structure is the quickest and most eco-
nomical method of construction. This per-
mits the re-use of forms by moving them
intact to each new pouring location. How-
ever, this method is not suitable for
certain forms such as the dome. This
obstacle remains a major problem in the
economical handling of form work.
Another problem involved is extensive
organization of the labor force. As each
job varies, construction crews must be

structure. Generally the work crew falls
into three classifications; the men respon-
sible for the actual pouring into the
forms, those who properly apply and
vibrate the poured cement, and the indi-
viduals who perform the finishing opera-
tions on the drying concrete. Above all,
proper coordination and supervision is
needed.
Other Special Problems and Advantages
Because the techniques for shell struc-
ture are so specialized, many contractors
remain unfamiliar with the problems and
methods of building shells. Although
some designs also require the purchase of
special equipment by the contractor, most
of the designs can be erected economically
and quickly without special construction
aids. One drawback which sometimes
hinders the use of shells in the difficulty
of complete insulation. Often, when com-
plete insulation is required, the thin-shell
structure can not be considered at all.
However, shells can be partially insulated
in many ways. Contractors commonly
solve insulation problems by the addition
of an insulating aggrete (resembling
ground corn cobs) to the wet cement.
Cork or felt insulation can also be ap-
plied, in layers, to the outside of the
shell. Another solution involves applying
rock wool insulation to the shell under-
side.
Above all, thin-shell concrete struc-
tures are efficient. A common hen's egg
demonstrates this efficiency for although
the egg is so fragile that the slighest con-
centrated load will crack it, its uniform
pressure is so great that a man is unable
to break it by squeezing it in his fist.
Other features have also won respect for
concrete shells. When designed properly,
they are more economical than any of the
usual sheltering constructions. Greater
freedom in designs, shapes, and combina-
tions exists, all of which can be manipu-
lated by the designer. A part of design
characteristics is the ease with which cer-
tain shells, including the sawtooth barrel
vault, provides natural light to buildings.
In the case of factories or auditoriums
and field houses, this is especially im-
portant.
These shells also incorporate a capacity
to carry loads that are unbalanced or ap-
plied in an unusual manner. Shell struc-
tures in Germany, as demonstrated in the
last war, showed remarkable resistance
to the effects of bombing attacks. In some
industrial plants the damaged parts of the
shell structure were bombed away and
rebuilt completely after successive ex-
plosions, but a total collapse was almost
impossible to obtain. Important too, was
the very slight sensitivity shown to foun-
dation settlement. The advantages of
using concrete were shown in another
fashion, for a concrete structure insures
safety from fire.
These characteristics of high efficiency,
strength and low cost have caused shells
to increase in popularity. The greater free-
dom in design also attracts attention
although the more complex shapes raise

I Didn't Know There Was Such a Job
"Communications have always been one of my
main interests—in the Navy and at the University
of Michigan. So I was very happy when the
Michigan Bell Telephone Company invited me to
visit their headquarters to talk about a job.
"In Detroit I had a chance to look at a number
of departments, including one I'd never heard of
before, the Traffic Department. I found that, in
addition to the engineering of switchboards, it in-
volved the supervision and handling of calls. It
struck me like a wonderful opportunity to combine
staff engineering and field management.
"My first impression was right, too. because my
work covered both. First, I had on-the-job train-
ing assignments in several different kinds of offices
—local, Long Distance, dial and manual. Then I
worked in engineering, translating estimates of
future growth into the actual number of circuits
and switchboard positions required.
"Now I'm supervising the operation of one of the
boards I helped engineer. Briefly my job is to see
that my district gets the kind of equipment it needs
and that what we have is working properly. An-
other major part of my job is advising the super-
visors of the Long Distance operators. I like this
because it means working with people, too.
"Needless to say, I'm happy with my job. A job
I didn't even know existed."
Emmett Smith's job is with a Bell Telephone
Company. There are similar opportunities for
engineers with Bell Telephone Laboratories,
Western Electric and Sandia Corporation.

Panel discussions aid seniors
in recognizing opportunities
open to them.
Started last year to help students in
finding the right job and in meeting the
professional problems of engineering
practice, the Engineering Seminar Pro-
gram is again being sponsored by the
College of Engineering during the Fall
Semester. All engineering students, and
especially those who expect to start work
within the next year, are welcome to
attend the meetings of the Programs
which are being held on Thursdays at
4:00 P.M. in Room 311, West Engin-
eering Building.
At the first meeting, on September
29th, Dean G. G. Brown discussed the
considerations for selecting the right job,
and emphasized the primary importance
of finding the type of organization best
suited to the individual's personality from
the standpoint of either his willingness
to assume risk for the sake of opportunity
or his preference for security with a
possibly slower rate of progress to re-
sponsibilities. He also pointed out that
the functional type of work involved,
such as research, manufacturing, or sales,
is generally of considerably more signifi-
cance than an individual's technical
specialty, and that undue emphasis should
not, therefore, be placed on school spec-
ialties, especially at the bachelor's level.
At the following meeting, Professor
John G. Young discussed the techniques
for getting a job. He first emphasized
the importance of campus interviews and
described the procedure and content to
expect and to be prepared for. He then
pointed out the weakness of the campus
interview in determining the real spirit
and character of the employer's organiza-
tion as a place to work, and pointed out
how information on this question can be

obtained, especially during a plant visit.
Panel Discussions
Three "panel meetings" were held
this year as part of the Engineering Sem-
inar Program conducted by the College
of Engineering. The main purpose
of the panel meeting was to help
students in determining what job they
are best fitted for. It was proposed
to do this by affording the students an
opportunity to talk with a number of
engineering graduates who have had a
variety of experience in different types
of organizations and work. By discussing
these experiences at first-hand, it was
hoped that the students gained a more
realistic conception of the nature of some
of the opportunities open to them, so that
they will be better able to identify their
own interests and aptitudes with the
opportunities which are most appropriate
for them. It is also hoped that the dis-
cussions have incidentally help the stu-
dents in making good on their first job
by bringing out some of the important
differences to be expected between the
school and work situation which often
cause frustrations and unhappiness in
the period following graduation.
Forty-three interested students attended
the first of the panel meetings on October
20. One of the most important phases
of the program was the reviews of the
life of each panel member after his
graduation. Immediately after this intro-
duction the panel was open for questions
from the students themselves. Since all
of the panel members were skilled en-
gineers coming from a comparatively
small manufacturing company, one of the
main discussions was based on the ad-
vantages and disadvantages of working
with a small company. The main reason
why these engineers preferred their
present employment stemmed from the
fact that each of these men developed in
interest in "growing with their company
In that respect they felt adjusted to their
work and likewise got much more en-
joyment out of their accomplishments.
Also during the discussion the question
was raised as to what was the most com-
mon difficulty for the engineer after
graduation. The answer was unanimous-
ly agreed upon as "English" particularlv
involving the writing of reports. In the
words of Electrical Engineer, John
Cataldo .... "Life is nothing but i

Average Salaries Rising with Demand
PROFESSOR JOHN G. YOUNG, Assistant to Dean
A new high in the demand for en-
gineering graduates will be reached this
year according to Professor John G.
Young, Assistant to the Dean, who is in
charge of the Engineering Placement
Office. At the beginning of school this
fall, about 25 per cent more employers
than last year had made arrangements
for interview visits to the College, and
reports from all over the country indicate
that their requirements will be even high-
er than last year.
Students who are graduating this year,
therefore, are urged to obtain from the
Placement Office a copy of the list of
employers who are coming in order to
plan in advance for interviewing those
companies in which they are most inter-
ested. Interviewing will start this year
on October 17th.
How to Use the Placement Services.
To obtain maximum benefit from the
Engineering Placement Services, the fol-
lowing items should be noted.
New Location: In order to provide
better over-all service to both students
and employers, the Engineering Place-
ment Office has been moved from Room
248 to Room 347 in the West Engineer-
ing Building. The bulletin board on
which all interview notice visits are
announced, together with the appoint-
ment schedules and the employers' des-
criptive literature, will be found in the
hall directly opposite this room.
Registration Procedure: To use any of
the available services it is necessary only
to complete a "Placement Information
Card," available at the Engineering
Placement Office, Room 347, West En-
gineering Building. These services cover
all types of work including regular,
temporary or part-time.
For interviewing, it is also necessary
to sign the appointment schedule and to
turn in a completed application blank to
the Placement Office as soon as possible
and not later than noon of the day before
the interview visit.
New Service: To help students in ob-
taining first-hand information concerning
employers in whom they may be inter-
ested, the bulletin board "Notices of
Interview Visits" will this year include
the names of "Faculty Liaison" contacts.
These are members of the faculty who
have a personal knowledge of the em-
ployer who is visiting and who are will-
ing to consult with students concerning
that employer's opportunities. Students
are encouraged to take advantage of this
opportunity for discussion both before
and after interviews.
Report of Interviewing Last Year.
The volume of employment interview-
ing in the Engineering College during
1954-55 showed an increase over the
preceding year of over 40 percent in
both the number of interview visits ar-
ranged and in the number of individual
interviews conducted.
Specifically, a total of 392 different
employers arranged to make interview
visits to the College and 126 of these
arranged two visits during the year, mak-
ing a total of 518 visits arranged. Of
these arrangements, 108, or about 20
per cent, were cancelled, the main reason
being that not enough students made in-
terview appointments in these cases to
justify the visit.
A total of 891 students made interview
appointments through the Engineering
Placement Office. Of these, 771, or 87
per cent, were engineers, and 120 were
from other Schools and Colleges of the
University. The total number of inter-
views conducted was 4,217, of which
1,263 were in the Fall Semester and
2,954 in the Spring. The average number
of interviews per student was 4.7, which
indicates an increase of about 34 per
cent when compared to the figure of 3-5
for the preceding year.
The starting pay offered to B.S.E.
graduates varied from $336 to $526 per
month, an average of $390 for the 182
offers reported to the Placement Office.
Masters degrees received offers of $350
to $600, averaging $451 for the ninety
offers reported and Ph.Ds ranged from
$550 to $675, for an average of $612 for
13 reported offers. The average of $390
for B.S.E. graduates compares with $373
the preceding year, indicating an in-
crease of 4.5 per cent.

Saran Wrap is stretched by injecting compressed air to form a bubble Vi mil in thickness which is then compressed and wound.
Bubble, bubble, toil and brainwork...
Dow engineers create modern new plant for Saran
Wrap production
Demand was multiplying for Saran Wrap. Housewives
across the nation wanted more and more of this clear,
moistureproof plastic wrap for foods. A new plant was
needed . . . and needed fast.
Dow's engineering and technical staff went to work. Pro-
duction processes were checked and improved. Mechanical
engineers designed new machinery. Electrical engineers
introduced new fluorescent lighting (shielded by an entire
ceiling of corrugated plastic) eliminating glare from Saran
Wrap which would have tired the eyes. Modern plant
innovations were widely apparent as the blueprints came
in from engineer after engineer.
Then the job was done. Hard work and brainwork had
produced an enviable new plant ready to produce in excess
of 5,000,000 Saran Wrap rolls a month. Dow-engineered
from start to finish, it stands as a testimonial to the depth
and talent of Dow engineering and planning.
Dow is interested in all types of engineers and scientists
who are considering a Do w future. And for the Dow sales pro-
gram, in addition to engineers and scientists, those with
partial engineering and scientific training are also needed.
Whether you choose research, production or sales, you
can find a challenging career with Dow. Write to Technical

Unions for Engineers?... No!
by HELEN REEVES, '58E.E.
The article, "Should Engineers Union-
ize", in last month's Technic was written
by James Carper, a psychologist. After
interviewing engineering students, pro-
fessors, and industrial men concerning
the article, we found these people in
violent disagreement with Mr. Carper's
attack on the engineering professional
society and his conclusion that engineers
are in danger of losing stature and se-
curity unless they devise some form of
unionization.
The first statement each engineer made
after reading the article was, "The man
who wrote this is obviously not an en-
gineer." Therefore, we of engineering,
feel commanded to give reply to "Should
Engineer's Unionize" from an engineer's
viewpoint.
Mr. Carper infers that engineers are
in need of protection when he states that
other professional men have strong pro-
fessional societies to protect them. We
ask: protect them from what? What
group of college graduates, other than
engineers' receive a greater initial salary
and has greater opportunity for ad-
vancement? Are these engineers in such
bad shape that they need protection of
some sort? The increasing demand for
engineers does not, at this time, indicate
that they are at a loss for stature and
security.
In attempt to explain the defects of
the professional engineering society, Mr.
Carper contrasted the medical profession
with the engineering profession. We do
not believe that his analogy was accurate,
in that engineering as a profession differs
from other professions right down to its
codes of ethics and conduct.
In the early days of a profession such
as medicine, the members received their
training from the individual teachings
of older practicing members. This teach-
ing came, mostly, by word of mouth.
In turn for receiving his education, the
individual was obligated to teach that
which he had learned to other unknow-
ing members. This sort of, 'if you know
something that I don't know, then you
gotta tell me' attitude still prevails in the
older professions. It accounts for the
close relationships between fellow pro-
fessional members and for the centralized
control of the profession itself.
On the other hand, the engineering
profession makes no pretense of having
control over the employment or training
of its members. Its standards require
members to service public need and de-
velop environmental improvements. We
illustrate the fundamental contrast be-
tween engineering and other professional
societies by an excerpt from the Ameri-
can Institute of Chemical Engineers'
Professional Standards Brochure which
states: "Detailed codes of ethics for the
chemical engineer are too limited and in-
flexible to meet all professional contin-
gencies. It is preferable to set forth only
some general rules which have been ac-
cepted by men of experience ..." In
effect, the engineering professional so-
ciety is not a 'traditional' one.
We cannot agree with Mr. Carper that
the engineering profession must compete
with the loyalty demanded by the organi-
zation in which a member works and
that the member identifies himself more
with the organization than with fellow
professionals. Again, Mr. Carper com-
pares the loyalty and identification of the
engineer to that of the doctor. The en-
gineer does not practice independently,
as does the doctor. He, on the average,
is employed by an organization. From the
point of view of employment, it would
be rather hard for the engineering so-
ciety to command a direct loyalty and
identification parallel to the medical pro-
fession. The engineering society has no
desire to do this, anyway. The organiza-
tion in which the engineer is employed
is indirectly carrying out the principles
advocated by the engineering profession
in that it does serve public need.
Competition between engineers is keen,
we admit. Yet we do not agree that it is
destructive. The engineer, more than any
other professional man, has greater op-
portunity to gain better positions faster.
However, this advancement can only be
achieved through proving individual
worth. This is done by creating technol-
ogical advances which, ultimately, do
the profession more good than harm. We
see no destruction or impediment of
progress in this area.
The licensing of the professional man,
as suggested by Mr. Carper, has been ex-
perimented with in some areas of engin-
eering. It has not proven beneficial
enough to be compulsary for the main-
tenance of professional standards. Many
of our best engineers do not even have
a college diploma. For an example of
these uneducated 'best^ we need only
turn our eyes to nearby Detroit. The en-
gineering profession is impressed by
ability, not title. The profession feels, in
essence, that a sheepskin, a license, and
a dime will buy a cup of coffee.
In conclusion of our professional so-
ciety counter-attack, we repeat that engin-
eering is a relatively new and non-tradi-
tional profession in comparison to law
and medicine. It demands strict adherence
to ethics and serves in the respect of
giving members the opportunity to share
and gather ideas. It also assists members
needy of jobs and perpetually encourages
members to obtain more schooling.
Mr. Carper next despairs that the en-
gineering profession loses many members
to positions in management, inferring
that these advancements do not provide
the promoted with higher stature in the
eyes of his fellow workers. We do not
need to explain this point to disprove it.
He also states that positions in manage-
ment will require small use of former
technical knowledge.
The reason that the engineer is so
readily absorbed by the egregious can be
explained by an individual and competi-
tive desire for progress and self-better-
ment. The present status of the engineer
in industry is also a determining factor
in his access to management promotion.
22
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


engineer will profit most with
professional societies.
We have two distinct levels in industry:
the management which makes company
policy and distributes responsibility, and
the trade persons who carry out, physic-
ally, this responsibility and company
policy. In between these two levels we
encounter the engineer. He serves as a
type of liason between management and
trade people because it is the engineer that
advances a continually favorable environ-
ment for both levels of industry. He does
this by creating technological changes
beneficial to increased productivity and,
therefore, improved economy for both
management and trade. The engineer, in
performing his services, becomes aware
of the needs of both levels. This theo-
retical awareness plus technical 'know-
how" puts the engineer in a logical posi-
tion to assume the greater responsibility
and prestige of an executive.
A good explanation of the easy dis-
posal of the engineer from his liason is
offered by George J. Hubner, Jr., Execu-
tive Engineer, Chrysler Engineering
Division, Missile Development. The ex-
cerpt is quoted from a speech given be-
fore the University of Michigan chapter
of Tau Beta Pi.
"Today engineers, in addition to
their technical accomplishments, are
managers, supervisors, salesmen, and
executives of the highest responsi-
bilities. They may deal with public
and human and governmental rela-
tions on a broad scale. Because they
have so much to offer, modern so-
ciety has asked them to contribute
more and more. The demand for
their services grows apace."
Now, let us turn to the Minneapolis
Honeywell Corporation as Mr. Carper
exemplified it in his article. He discussed
the Honeywell engineers who are union-
ized. This is all well and good for the
engineers to be union members but where
does Honeywell draw its management
personnel? Union people tend to work
against management; obviously this man-
agement source will not be the engineer.
Today, when the most excellent source of
management is the engineer, this other
source of personnel appears to be indefin-
able. Therefore, it appears that neither
Honeywell management nor engineers are
benefiting from unionization.
The most violent disagreement with
Mr. Carper occurred over his discussion
of the possible unionization of the en-
gineer. Professor Boyce, Department
Head of Civil Engineering, strongly feels
that engineering is a profession, not a
trade. He fears that unionization would
retard the freedom of advancement of
the profession, itself, and that top man-
agement would lose its greatest source of
personnel. He cited a former automotive
company which required the engineer to
unionize to get seniority. If he accepted a
promotion to management the union took
away his seniority. This clearly illustrates
a union method of stilting the desire for
individual and professional advancement.
Unionization advocates advancement
and benefits for the mass of workers.
Unions represent persons who need to
have bargaining strength as a group. In
a capsule, the union benefits those people
who are unable to progress by their own
merit.
Within the realm of engineering we
occasionally encounter the individual un-
able to progress by his own merit. It,
therefore, becomes necessary to define
the engineer, this other individual, and
the evolution of both.
Engineering is a relatively new pro-
fession. Not that it has been in existence
for a short time, but rather it has just
recently been unscrambled and separately
identified from other walks of industry.
We, therefore, find persons in industry;
all the way from a draftsman to a chief
engineer, holding the title of engineer.
These two people may work in the same

Vim and Vigor is the pass-
word of our new M. and I:
Department Head.
Boys, meet Wyeth Allen, Professor of
Industrial Engineering and Chairman,
Departments of Mechanical and Indus-
trial Engineering.
And brothers in the Engine school take
heed. Don't ever decide to go in and
bop our new M. and I. Dept. head on
the nose. He's 6 ft. 2 in. tall, 195 pounds,
and has got more energy than the whole
of the class of '58.
Professor Allen is a native of Milwau-
kee, but when he was very young his
family moved to Oregon. In that far
Northwestern corner he received his high
school education, and thence came to
Michigan in 1911- In 1915, equipped
with his B.A. in Mechanical Engineering,
he set out into the world.
Forty full years later he is once again
a part of the Michigan Engine school.
This will be Dr. Allen's—he received his
Ph.D. degree from the University in 1953
—freshman year again, having made his
start in his new position in the beginning
of the '55 fall semester.
It is not the business of this sketch,
and besides, there is not enough space,
to give a full account of Professor Allen's
forty years in the big outside. Just note-
that during that time he married a Mich-
igan alumna, had three children, all of
whom graduated from this same Univer-
Dr. and Mrs. Wyeth Allen at an Oasis in the Sahara Desert.
sity, was associated with business and
University Alumni affairs and managed
to visit extensively four continents, par-
ticipate actively in some forty-odd organ-
izations, and become a leader in industrial
engineering and management. It was
about this point in the interview that I
asked Dr. Allen if he felt at all tired.
His energetic answer is seen at the top
of the page.
Incidentally, the accompanying photo-
graph is not a half-time shot of the
Mich.-Army game. That's Dr. and Mrs.
Allen at an oasis in the Sahara desert.
Dr. Allen, who professes a love for
travel, saw much of North and South
America, Europe, and Africa with his
wife. Professor Allen dropped a well-
qualified tip on the subject of traveling,
i.e., if you want to learn something about
a country you've got to "get off the beaten
tourist track." He maintained that the
artificial veneer of the tourist center pre-
vented visitors from getting any feeling
for the true nature of the country.
Dr. Allen, busy answering phone calls
and talking to yours truly, at the same
time, appears to be inclined toward per-
petual motion. Besides covering the globe,
he enjoys hunting, fishing, working out-
doors, and in general doing everything
that stirs the average man to contempla-
tion. He is a man happy with "too many
projects on the fire," "enough to do until
twenty years after retirement," "no
secrets," and an infectious sort of energy
and warmth.
Although he has a big administrative
job. Dr. Allen also does some teaching
on management, especially for the ad-
vanced courses. Incidentally, a warning to
any of you boys who might sit in a
future class of Dr. Allen's, there is a
strong indication that this man is tele-
pathic to some degree. At any rate that
is how he professes to have gotten high
grades in college while not having done
any homework. There is the possibility
that this man is also modest .... how-
ever, don't say you weren't warned if he
reads your mind someday.

IS YOUR GUIDE TO
FINER TELEVISION
RCA's 36 years' experience
is yours to share in TV-
black-and-white or color
To pioneer and develop television, in color
as well as in black-and-white, called for a
special combination of practical experi-
ence, great resources and research facili-
ties in the fields of communications and
electronics.
RCA was well qualified to do the job:
experience: RCA has been the recog-
nized leader in radio communications
since its formation thirty-six years ago.
Its world-wide wireless circuits, estab-
lished in 1919, and its development of
electron tubes, laid the groundwork for
radio broadcasting in 1920 . . . and the
first nationwide radio network in 1926.
Radio broadcasting led to television—
and in 1939 RCA made history by intro-
ducing black-and-white TV as a service
to the public.
Dr. V. K. Zworykin of RCA invented
the Iconoscope, or television camera tube,
and he developed the Kinescope, now uni-
versally used as the picture tube.
resources: Pioneering and develop-
ment of color TV has been one of the
most challenging and expensive projects
ever undertaken by private industry. To
date, RCA has spent $50,000,000 on color

Layout of the Aerodynamics Lab on North Campus.
180 mph in this region where the area
is 35 square feet.
It is intended to utilize this laboratory
for both educational and research pur-
poses. Using the facilities of this lab,
the University is planning to enter an
intensive study of gusts and their aero-
dynamic effect. Although the NACA
has also done much work in this field,
it has been done chiefly on aircraft
models. The University of Michigan
however, will enact its tests upon the
component parts of aircraft so as to exact
data upon each part as a separate unit.
Wing sections, particularly, will be ob-
jects of study in the low speed wind
tunnel. Experiments are planned in
which simulated gusts encounter the wing
section and enact various forces upon
it which parallel actual flight conditions.
By definition a gust is a sudden en-
countering of an air flow not in the
same direction as the main air stream.
When a gust is encountered in flight, the
aircraft is buffeted around to an extent
determined by the magnitude of the gust.
This results in a very rough and bumpy
flight.
It would indeed be a consequential
development if some method were devised
by which the effect of these gusts could
be minimized. By finding out more about
these contrary winds, the University's labs
hope to derive a method or a design to
reduce gust effect.
In the wind tunnel actual gusts are
not introduced, but rather, conditions arc
created which produce the same effect as
gusts. The wing section is set at an
angle of attack of level flight and devel-
ops only enough lift to maintain this level
flight. Just below and to the rear of the
section, a solid bump is introduced into
the tunnel. The shape of this bump is
roughly similar to the top symmetry of
an airfoil. When the air stream meets
this bump, it is forced to change its di-
rection and travel over the top of the
obstacle.
This induces the air to meet the wing
section at an angle and create the same
effect as if the angle of incidence had
been increased. The result of the in-
creased angle is a greated amount of lift
being produced.
To produce the effect of a momentary
gust, this bump is set in motion in the
same direction as the air stream. A very
sudden gust is simulated by moving the
bump with the stream at about one-half
the air speed. These sudden gusts do not
develop as much lift as the more gradual
do, but their effect is more prolonged.
If more information can be compiled
about this factor of flight, it is quite
probable that future aeronautical engin-
eers will be able to design its effects right
out of the aircraft.
Thus, with its new aerodynamical and
propulsion laboratories, Michigan will
not only be able to prockjre more engin-
eers, but it is assured that Wiese engineers
will possess a wider range of knowledge
than ever before possible. A very worth-
while accomplishment indeed!

MECHANICAL ENGINEERS are concerned with
many phases including experimental testing
and development, mechanical design, stress
and vibration analysis, combustion research,
heat transfer and nuclear reactor development.
AERONAUTICAL ENGINEERS work on innumer-
able internal and external airflow problems
concerned with design, development and
testing of aircraft powerplants. Some who
specialize in analytical engineering forecast
engine-airplane combinations a decade in
advance of design.
ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS directly contribute
their specialized skills to the analysis and
development of controls, systems and special
instrumentation. An example is the "Plotto-
mat" which automatically integrates and plots
pressures, temperatures and air angles in
performance testing.


An aircraft powerplant is such a complex machine
that its design and development
require the greatest variety of engineering skills.
Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft's engineering team
has consistently produced
the world's best aircraft engines.
The best planes are always designed
around the best engines. Eight of the most
important new military planes are powered by
Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft J-57 turbojets.
The first two jet transports in the United States
will use J-57s. Further, no less than
76 percent of the world's commercial air transports
are powered by other Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft powerplants.
Such an enviable record can only be built
on a policy which encourages, recognizes and
rewards individual engineering achievement.

. . . What is the origin of the expres-
sion "OK"?
A Choctaw Indian chief named Old
Keokuk, was accustomed to signing pa-
pers with his initials. From this the Indian
word okeh, which means "It is so and no
other way" developed. The expression has
become almost a part of the English lan-
guage and has become a part of the
common speech even in foreign coun-
tries, such as France and Germany.
. . . Why we say "God Bless You"?
In the Middle Ages, a superstition held
that when a person sneezed, the Devil
entered his body. The blessing "God Bless
You" was supposed to protect the soul of
the one who sneezed from Satan, and it
was considered a sign of hostility if
someone sneezed and no one said the
blessing.
. . . Why ships are christened with
champagne?
Before the nineteenth century, a wide
variety of liquids had been used to chris-
ten ships before their maiden voyages.
These included wine, milk, and even
ocean water. A clever salesman for the
champagne industry while looking for a
way to popularize the drink, persuaded
the French government to use the cham-
pagne for the christening and the idea
stuck.
. . . How the yard was first measured?
Because of much confusion over meas-
urements, Henry I of England (1068-
1135) had his arm measured at shoulder
height. The distance from his nose to the
end of his thumb was 36 inches. This be-
came the yard as established by royal de-
cree. Similarly, the palm became 3 inches,
the hand 4 inches, the span (tip of
thumb to tip of little finger) 9 inches,
and the foot 12 inches.
. . • Why we say "knock on wood"?
We say this when expressing a hope
because of an ancient Druid custom. The
Druids believed that the trees were in-
habited by powerful gods, and when mak-
ing plans they touched the bark as a sign
of respect, so that the gods would not put
obstacles in their paths.
. . . Where "horsepower" got its name?
The term "horsepower" was originated
by James Watt more than a century ago
when he carried out experiments with
strong draft horses to find out the rate
at which a horse under average conditions
does its work. He fixed this rate at 550
foot-pounds of work per second. This,
then, became the value of one horsepower.
. . . Why the smiling and crying masks
are the symbols of the theater?
The ancient Greek theaters where drama
had its origin seated a great many people,
many of whom were too far away to hear
what the actors were saying or to see the
expressions on their faces. The actors,
therefore, wore masks with crying or
smiling faces on them to more easily put
across the actions. The masks also con-
tained small megaphones that amplified
the actors' voices.
. . . Where we got the word "electric-
ity"?
Static electricity was described as long
ago as 600 B.C., by Thales of Miletus,
one of the seven wise men of ancient
Greece. The Greek word for amber is
elektron, and since it was the first sub-
stance to show this property of attraction,
William Gilbert (1540-1603), physician
to Queen Elizabeth, called the property
"electrica." In 1650, Walter Charleton
changed the name to "electricity," the
name we use now.
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
AT ATOMS FOR PEACE
CONFERENCE
A suggestion that United Nations
health authorities consider building pilot
plants for irradiating food in the areas
of the world where the need for the
control of food-borne parasitic diseases
is greatest was made by a University of
Michigan engineer.
Prof. Henry J. Gomberg told the
Atoms for Peace conference in Geneva.
Switzerland, that gamma radiation from
nuclear reactor by-products can break the
disease cycle of trichinosis in pork, and
that it should be investigated as a method
of curtailing similar diseases around the
world.
He mentioned Chinese liver fluke, in-
testinal fluke, beef tapeworm. Oriental
lung fluke and fish tapeworm anemia as
other diseases that could be restricted by
the irradiation of infected foods such as
meat, fish, crabs and crayfish.
Some of these diseases affect as mam-
as 644 million people, he pointed out in
a paper he co-authored with Dr. S. E.
Gould of the Wayne County (Mich.)
General Hospital.
"If the potential for growth of the
parasite when lodged in the intermediate
host (food) is destroyed, the disease can
be eliminated, Prof Gomberg said.
"Sufficient radioactive material for
many radiation sources is in existence in
the waste storage pits of the chemical
processing plants of the United States
Atomic Energy Commission," he added.
"Similar supplies exist in other parts
of the world wherever large scale reactor
operation is in progress. And as the use
of atomic energy for electric power gen-
eration expands, suitable radioactive sup-
plies will be even more abundant."
Research at the University of Michigan
has shown that radiation doses from Co-
balt 60 or Cesium 137 will prevent
trichina larvae from growing and will
sterilize them so they cannot reproduce.
Professor Gomberg said. No undesirable
secondary effects from this method of
processing have been discovered, he-
added.
The speaker reported that U-M engin-
eers already have designed a facility that
could handle 2000 hog carcasses a day
at less than one-fourth cent a pound.

"After I received my B.S. in Chemistry in 19S3, I joined
Bakelite Company. Following eight months with an expe-
rienced engineer I began independent development work on
new thermosetting molding materials. I handle many prod-
uct problems — from baby bottle caps to guided missile ele-
ments—and work closely with sales and production people."
"I'm a metallurgical engineer, Class of '49.1 went to work for
Electro Metallurgical Company because their training pro-
gram led directly into supervisory production work. By 1952
I was a Production Engineer. My work has broadened con-
siderably since then, and includes technical control and direct
supervision of the production of several tungsten alloys."
IN PETROCHEMICALS
"Carbide and Carbon Chemicals Company's work with petro-
chemicals seemed to promise a big future. That's one reason
whv I joined them, right after I received my Master's degree
in chemical engineering, in '54.1 was assigned immediately to
research and development on the coal hydrogenation process,
with specific problems in process design and plant evaluation."
IN PRODUCTION CONTROL
"I'm a chemical engineer, Class of '50.1 started with National
Carbon Company as a research assistant in a development
lab. In '54 I was promoted to group leader of control engi-
neers, responsible for installing and proving in an automatic
furnace for the continuous production of activated carbon.
Now I'm in charge of the control lab at one of our plants."

In two other technical papers, U-M
researchers also reported that:
1. A number of chemical reactions of
possible industrial importance can be
promoted by gamma radiation, and de-
serve "serious consideration" by manu-
facturers.
2. Gamma sterilization of human
bones for "bone banks" and of bulk
medical supplies is "one of the most
promising uses" of fission products.
The study of the effect of radiation on
chemical reactions was made by Leigh
C. Anderson, professor of chemistry;
Joseph J. Martin, associate professor of
chemical and metallurgical engineering;
and Bruce G. Bray, graduate student in
chemistry.
In a paper read by Professor Martin,
they described the polymerization and
chlorination of chemicals in the presence
of gamma radiation.
Their research has demonstrated the
commercial feasibility of the process, the
cost of which is "not out of line" with
that of present processing methods, Pro-
fessor Martin said. These findings could
be applied to the manufacture of plastics
and insecticides.
Gamma-ray sterilization of medical
supplies can affect economics of opera-
tion while still producing a product free
of microorganisms, Prof. Lloyd E. Brown-
ell and Joseph J. Bulmer reported in a
paper drawn from Bulmer's graduate re-
search.
They proposed irradiating materials
such as cotton, gauze, adhesive bandages
and surgical dressings after packaging
and before shipment to consumer mar-
kets. Present sterilization is done by high
pressure steam.
Professor Brownell reported that gam-
ma radiation is extremely penetrating,
and could pass through several pallet
loads of more tightly packed materials.
Complete sterilization would be assured,
he said, a wider choice of packaging ma-
terials could be made, discoloring and
damaging of packages would be elimina-
ted, and the processing could be carried
out on a continuous "conveyor belt" oper-
ation rather than by more costly batch
operations.
Brownell and Bulmer submitted a de-
sign of a proposed irradiation facility
that would use cooling fuel elements
from nuclear reactors to sterilize the pro-
duction of a large manufacturing plant
at an estimated cost that "compares
favorable" with known costs of steam
sterilization.

What's involved
in production
work at
DuPont?
DAVID L. JOHNSON, JR., expects to receive his B.S.Ch.E.
from the University of Kansas in 1956. He is very active in
campus affairs, president of Alpha Chi Sigma and a member of
several honorary engineering fraternities. Dave is interested in
learning more about production work in the chemical industry.
Jim Hamilton answers:
JAMES L. HAMILTON is one of the many young
engineers who have been employed by Du Pont
since the end of the war. After service in the
Navy, Jim got his B.S.Ch.E. from the University

Well, Dave, I've been doing production work at DuPont
for about seven years now, and I'm still getting in-
volved in new things. That's what makes the work so
interesting—new and challenging problems arise all
the time.
To generalize, though, the duties are largely admin-
istrative. That's why effectiveness in working with
others is one of the prime requirements. Teamwork is
important in research and development work, for sure.
But it's even more important in production, because
you work each day with people having widely differ-
ent skills and backgrounds.
A production supervisor needs a good understanding
of engineering and scientific principles, too. He has to
have that to get the best results from complicated
equipment—but he doesn't necessarily need the spe-
cialized training that goes with research and develop-
ment work. A real interest in engineering economics
and administration is usually more helpful to him
here than advanced technical training. The dollar
sign's especially important in production work.
It all adds up to this, Dave. If you enjoy teamwork,
and have a flair for large-scale, technical equipment,
then you'll find production work mighty rewarding.

There was a young and adventurous
fellow whose great-grandad left him
nothing much but the logs from the old
salt's seafaring days. The young fellow
never quite got up courage enough to
toss the books out, and one day was
leafing idly through them. Stuck between
two pages he found a much-folded paper
which read as follows:
"Sail to 16 North latitude and 16 West
longitude where thou wilt find a deserted
island. There lieth a large meadow, not
pent, on the north shore of the island
where standeth a lonely oak and a lonely
pine. There wilt thou also see an old
gallows on which we once were wont to
hang traitors. Start thou from the gal-
lows and walk to the oak counting thy
steps. At the oak thou must turn right
by a right angle and take the same num-
ber of steps. Put here a spike in the
ground. Now must thou return to the
gallows and walk to the pine counting
thy steps. At the pine thou must turn
left by a right angle and see that thou
takest the same number of steps, and put
another spike into the ground. Dig half-
way between the spikes; the treasure is
there."
The instructions were quite clear and
explicit, so our boy chartered a ship and
sailed to the South Seas. He found the
island, the field, the oak, the pine: in-
deed, he found everything he was look-
ing for but the gallows. Rain, sun, and
wind had long since taken away all trace
of the wooden structure. How did our
hero find the treasure?
Answers next month.

"How long have you been here?" ask-

"Thirteen years," replied the castaway.
"All alone—then you're going to have-

years," said the girl.
"You don't mean to tell me that there's
beer in that barrel!" said he.

A: It may have plenty to do with both. Here's
how:
Football teams are judged by scoring ability in
top competition—teamwork, form, ability, strategy,
class. So, too, are aircraft companies.
Martin has created one of the finest engineering
teams in the whole world of aviation. And under
the new Martin concept of design and development
by team operation, every engineering problem—
from today's experimental contract to the frontier
problems of the future—is the target for a coor-
dinated "aerial attack" by a top-flight team of
specialists.
Result: Martin's team operation technique has
opened up important opportunities for young
creative engineers.

Nearly all guided missiles require specialized and highly
advanced electronic systems of miniature proportions. These
systems may include servo-amplifiers, microwave receivers
and transmitters and extremely efficient though compact
power supplies. The performance objectives for this equipment
would be difficult in conventional engineering applications.
At Hughes, the achievement of such objectives in the very
limited space and under stringent environmental conditions of
the modern guided missile provides an unusual challenge to
the creative engineer.
Positions are open for Engineers or Physicists with experi-
ence in systems analysis, electronic guidance systems, infrared
techniques, miniature control servo and gyro systems, micro-
wave and pulse circuitry, environmental testing, systems main-
tenance, telemetering, launching systems and flight test
evaluation.

many types for many needs
In previous advertisements in this
series, the many advantages of the
Torrington Needle Bearing and the
proper procedure for its installation
and maintenance have been dis-
cussed. The DC unit type bearing
was used in these discussions be-
cause it is the Needle Bearing with
by far the greatest variety of appli-
cations throughout industry.
From the basic Needle Bearing
design, however, many modifica-
tions have been made. The result is
a complete line of Needle Bearings
suitable for specific applications.
Although these bearings are all
different, each offers the advan-
tages which have made the DC unit
type so popular. They give the
highest possible radial load capac-
ity in a minimum.of space; they are
light in weight, easy to install and
simple to lubricate.
The following chart shows many
types of Torrington Needle Bear-
ings, gives their design features and
general applications for which they
are designed.

office building, but it is here that their
similarity ends. The engineering pro-
fession has yet to differentiate between
the two—the technician and the legiti-
mate engineer. The latter is a person
combining art and science in si-
fashion as to create technological dev p-
ment. This man creates, the other _ -r-
forms.
The young engineer, upon colli grad-
uation, has received a diploma signifying
that he has completed a curriculum of
study in basic engineering knowledge. At
this point he contains as broad a general
knowledge of engineering that his school
was able to give him in four to five years'
time. His next move is into an industrial
organization. Here, he will be placed in
a position suitable to his apptitudes and
liking. This position may vary from cloak-
and-dagger-man for the company's com-
petitive data section to chief rubber dis-
integrater in a rubber research laboratory.
His schooling, obviously, has not pre-
pared him for either of these jobs. So
his company will train him to do a
specific job.
At this point we may begin to differ-
entiate between the technician and the
engineer. We have our hypothetical young
engineer containing his basic knowledge
and his new job "know-how". If he
integrates the two we will find him, aside
from doing his job, keeping abreast with
advances in his field, accepting the max-
imum of responsibility showered upon
him, and constantly thinking of ways to
improve the units on which he works.
The technician, on the other hand, will
do his job and there his interest will
cease.
We may then define the engineer as an
individual who, from his own initiative,
will be a composite of three distinct
qualities. He will be creative, productive,
and responsible. These qualities are indi-
vidual and every engineer will possess
them in varying degrees. The extent of
each degree will be the determining
factor in the progress he will make in
his field. In turn, for utilization of his
individual initiative, the engineer will be
rewarded by his employer in terms of
salary and position promotions.
The technician does not contain these
qualities and the initiative to progress
by his own merit. Therefore, we will
classify the technician in that group need-
ful of unionization.
Professor Katz, Department Head of
(Chemical Engineering, stated that the
engineer, as we have defined him, would
have his individual incentive for progress
retarded if he were unionized. This
would result from the union character-
istic to treat every individual alike instead
of distributing individual reward when
it is due/Let us take a hypothetical ex-
ample of this individual regression.
We have two engineers, Mr. A and
Mr. B, working together. Mr. A has two
years' seniority over Mr. B, who is a new
employee. Mr. B creates a new process
for greater efficiency in doing his par-
ticular job. Under union standards, Mr.
B is unable to receive any company given
benefits or advancement because Mr. A
has seniority. Why should Mr. B exert
himself to think of better things when
he is not to be rewarded for them? Mr.
B and engineers like him would have
their competitive natures stilted by the
knowledge that seniority, not ability, is
more important.
We detect a change in values, Mr.
Carper.
Industry finds engineers capable of con-
troling otherwise handicapped environ-
mental aspects. In reply to Mr. Carper's
statement that the purpose of many labor
contracts is to stabilize labor and man-
agement relations—we find the present
liason level of the engineer doing this
very thing. Engineering promotes im-
provement, not protection, and manage-
ment needs this improvement for its
mass of skilled laborers. Unionize the
engineer and the liason will be dissolved;
this wonderful free field of engineering
will no longer present the opportunity
for proving individual worth.
Mr. Huebner, in another excerpt from
his speech, defines the ideal engineer.
"Mere competetance is not enough.
Merely doing the job as expected is
not enough. In our work we should
want that highest of praise that
comes from a really accomplished
boss who regards what we do and
says: "That's the way I'd do the job
myself." And among our associates,
to do the job in such a way as to
win that highest of praise from them
when they feel: "He's the kind of
guy I'd like to work with!"
This ideal state of engineering-being
is not to be reached by unionization. This
party believes that unions are operated
for economic cripples. The engineer is
not inclusive of that class of people,
today. We can forsee no future time
when he will be reduced to such a state.

New Electronic "Engineer"
Solves Tough Refinery Problem
The men who design modern oil refineries
need specific information about temperature
distributions in different parts of pressure
vessels. Such information, essential to safety
and efficient operation, is often extremely
difficult to obtain by conventional mathemat-
ical methods.
Scientists at Standard Oil's Whiting lab-
oratories recently developed and built an
electrical analogue capable of simulating spe-
cific conditions within a refinery unit still in
the design stage. Using this device, they could
determine in advance the temperature dis-
tribution in the joint between two pressure
vessels having a common head. Thus they
were able to duplicate in 20 seconds the heat
stress picture within the unit during an 8 hour
start-up to shut-down period.
Creative scientific thinking made possible
this constructive achievement by engineers
who have chosen to build their careers at
Standard Oil.

U. of M. Engineering College-Industry
Marriage Celebrates 1st Anniversary
On the first anniversary of the marriage"
of American industry to the University
of Michigan's College of Engineering,
both parties appear to be pleased with
the arrangement.
The "Wedding" was the start last year
of the College's Industry Program, a
unique plan to open direct channels of
communication between the two groups.
Under the program the College dis-
seminates information to, and arranges
technical meetings for, industries enrolled
for a fee of $3,000 a year for three
years.
The University gains through the in-
creased contact with industry, which helps
faculty members and students keep posted
on developments in their fields, and
which can result in sponsored research
projects.
At the same time, industry receives a
number of services, any one of which
may be worth the tax-deductable subscrip-
tion fee.
Twelve companies have signed up, and
the present growth rate is between one
and two new subscribers each month,
reports Prof. Harold A. Ohlgren, super-
visor of the program.
Among the subscribers are such indus-
trial leaders as American Motors, Argus
Camera, Ford, Chrysler, Dow Chemical,
General Mills and Owens-Illinois Glass
Company.
"We are trying to maintain a steady,
healthy rate of growth so that we can
continue to give subscribers individual
attention as the program expands," Pro-
fessor Ohlgren points out.
"In fact, the ultimate size of the pro-
gram will be governed by that factor,"
he adds.
"We are convinced that the pattern of
communication being developed within
the Industry Program is one of the best
ways American industry and education
can team up to solve many of their mu-
tual problems," Professor Ohlgren notes.
During the first year of the plan, 35
technical reports were made available to
subscribers, campus symposia were ar-
ranged, and University-industry represen-
tatives met in dozens of informal sessions.
Among the reports were five engineer-
ing manuals that summarized U-M experi-
ence and literature surveys in such fields
as welding, process engineering and high
temperature metallurgy. About a dozen
of the reports dealt with phases of atomic
energy and fission product utilization
sometime in the future. Since a year often
passes between authorship and publica-
tion of research data, Industry Program
subscribers gain a considerable head start
on new developments in their fields
through this service.
U-M engineering and research staff
members visit subscribing industries to
discuss research development, new ma-
terials and techniques, and long range
plans, and industrial participants are in-
vited to the campus tor similar activities.
Professor Ohlgren admits one of the
attractive features of the program is the
Iiklihood that engineer-hungry industries
may find it an additional avenue by
which they may approach and evaluate
graduating students.
The nominal subscription fee is
about one-fourth the cost of one tech-
nical man per year in an industrial re-
search laboratory, Professor Ohlgren says,
and is modest enough so that smaller in-
dustries can be supplied with data they
are unable to develop themselves.
Income from the program is being used
to make available information new in
existence that may be on file in a faculty
member's office, Professor Ohlgren re-
ports. This means abstracting the ma-
terial and having it printed and illus-
trated. As income increases, it will be
used to stimulate research in still other
areas of potential importance to indus-
try.
In the long run, industry will benefit
still more from the indirect promotion
of engineering education and research.
Professor Ohlgren adds.
Industry does not dictate what research
the College is to undertake, he empha-
sizes. Nor is the program a consulting
service for handling current industrial
problems.
U-M engineering faculty and Engineer-
ing Research Institute staff members will
continue to produce between ten and
thirteen thousand pages of original re-
search data each year, and much of this
will be brought specifically to the atten-
tion of the industries concerned.
The Industry Program already has
assisted many staff members and doctoral
students in the preparation of technical
papers. Three of the doctoral theses. Pro-
fessor Ohlgren adds, have turned out to
be "major contributions" to their fields.
'Hot Dirt' Studied in Westinghouse

Radioactive carbon is helping scien-

oratories find an answer to that age-old
problem of humanity—dirt.
In research broadly aimed at finding
out why dirt sticks to cloth and other
material, and how best to remove it, Dr.
E. B. Ashcraft, Westinghouse research
chemist, "tags" the dirt with radioactive
carbon and traces this "hot dirt" through
the cleaning cycle. The technique has
turned up an encouraging fact: Mrs.

water has many uses
Fortunately, not much water is used like this.
Engineers know that America's greatest natural resource has many other
vital uses. Supplying homes and industries with adequate water . . . today
and for the future ... is a job both challenging and rewarding . . . one that
merits the talents of America's best young engineers.
Cast iron pipe plays an important part in that job. Today, practically
every city in America—large or small—uses it for water and gas mains. Over
60 American cities are still served by cast iron pipe laid over a century ago.
That's why engineers turn to cast iron pipe for the efficient, economical

anode, and separate tubes (each costing
several hundred dollars) must be used
to obtain different kinds of x-rays.
"We have been able to produce new
and unique radiations by using anodes
plated with metals such as gallium," Dr.
Taylor said. "This metal has such a low
melting point that it is impossible to use
it as a target in any sort of conventional
x-ray tube."
The scientist stated that the new x-ray
machine has made possible the study
of atomic arrangements at a new range
of high and low temperatures. Because
of the great intensity of the x-ray
beam, photographs which ordinarily
require an exposure of one or two hours
can be made in a matter of minutes.
Thus, x-ray "snapshots" of metals as
hot as 3000 degrees Fahrenheit have been
taken by Dr. Taylor, making it possible
to study a metal before it vaporizes or
undergoes some chemical change at the
elevated temperature.
The new x-ray tube is constructed of
stainless steel with walls one-fourth inch
thick. Like the rotating anode, these metal
walls are cooled with water, since elec-
trons rebounding from the target would
otherwise heat the walls red hot within
a few seconds. Inserted in the walls of
the tube are four "windows" made from
beryllium metal foil five-thousandths of
an inch thick. Through these "windows"
the super-power x-rays are beamed.
The Westinghouse Research Labora-
tories are already making intensive use of
the new x-ray equipment. Dr. Taylor
reported. A special type of x-ray image
amplifier tube called a FLUOREX—itself
a development of the Research Labora-
tories—is being provided for the machine.
This will permit direct observation of
the patterns formed by the atoms in
crystals without the necessity of taking
the usual x-ray photographs.
Dr. Taylor said that the machine is
also equipped with an adapter which
gives an x-ray beam only 400 millionths
of an inch in diameter—about one-tenth
the diameter of a human hair. This thin,
intense beam approaches the dimensions
of the tiny crystallites which make up a
crystal of metal, and permits the investi-
gation of individual crystals with an ex-
actness not possible with a beam of
larger size.

YOUR STEEL NOTEBOOK
The steel that could take
anything but a bath
o
In steel mills and warehouses, a roller leveler straight-
ens wide sheets and heavy plates between powerful
steel rolls.
Stress on the rolls is tremendous. To make them
strong and tough enough, one manufacturer used an
alloy steel, 52100. Then, to make the rolls bard
enough, they were heated to a high temperature and
quenched in a liquid bath. But the severe quench was
causing many of the rolls to warp.
The roll maker took his problem to Timken Com-
pany metallurgists, asked if he could make rolls from
52100 steel that wouldn't distort in quenching. They
said yes—if the steel were uniform from lot to lot in
analysis and hardenability.
TIMKEN® steel quality control solved
the distortion problem
The roll maker switched to 52100 steel made by the
Timken Company. He found the steel was uniform
from lot to lot, heat to heat, year in and year out.
Result: he was able to standardize heat-treating prac-
tice. Distortion was practically eliminated.
The Timken Company constantly solves steel prob-
lems like this one by furnishing steels to the most
exacting specifications. Timken Company metallur-
gists are specialists in fine alloy steels. And they use
the most modern quality control methods to assure
uniformity, time after time after time.

of our time and effort, we really know
very little about the mechanisms that
make dirt "stick' and what factors are
important in removing it," Dr. Ashcraft
declared.
Through rigidly controlled experiments
Westinghouse research scientists are at-
tempting to discover what physical and
chemical forces hold dirt to cloth and
how such things as detergents, mechanical
agitation, and water temperature break
down these forces. Samples of cloth arc
stained with a standard "dirt" containing
carbon black, a fat, and a protein, which
are the essential soiling ingredients in
dirty clothes. Any one of these three in-
gredients can be "tagged" by incorporat-
ing radioactive carbon into its composi-
tion. Such carbon "blows up" spontane-
ously and gives off beta particles which
can be counted with great precision. One
of the three ingredients is "tagged" and
the radioactivity of the stain before and
after washing is measured. The difference
in beta particle emission gives an accurate
measure of the amount of that particular
part of the "dirt" which has been re-
moved in the washing process.
Dr. Ashcraft said that the new radio-
active technique has revealed several facts
which contradict certain common beliefs
about the removal of dirt from cloth.
"A standard method of judging the
amount of dirt removed in laundering
has been to compare the whiteness' of
the cloth, by measuring the amount of
light reflected by the stain, before and
after washing," he said. "However, some
of our tests have shown that removing
as much as 42 percent of the carbon
black in a soiled cloth brings only a 16
percent increase in 'whiteness.' Evidently,
in order to achieve the sparkling white-
ness of which she is so proud, the aver-
age housewife must already be doing a
remarkable job of removing the dirt from
the weekly wash."
Grease or fat is generally pointed to
as the "culprit" in dirt which causes it
to stick, and the cleaning process simply
"cuts" the grease and removes it. Investi-
gations proves that dirt removal is not
quite this simple. Experiments show that
in certain cases 76 percent of the fat in
"dirt" must be removed in order to in-
crease reflectivity and "whiteness" of
56
cloth by only 14 percent. Furthermore,
up to 95 percent of the protein can be
removed in some samples of "dirt" with-
out changing the "whiteness" of the cloth
at all.
An important objective of Dr. Ash-
craft's research is to more accurately de-
termine the role of detergents in the
laundering process. Apparently the mole-
cules of a detergent insect themselves
between those of the cloth and the dirt.
This frees the dirt particles and holds
them in a finely divided suspension in
the water so that the dirt can be rinsed
away.
The use of radioactive tracers has al-
ready proved useful in studying the in-
dustrial cleaning of metals. Similar re-
search on cleaning problems in the home
eventually will bring the American house-
wife new methods and equipment which
will enable her to do an even better job
and in less time.
Westinghouse Purifies Titanium by
Zone Refining
Scientists at the Westinghouse Research
Laboratories are purifying titanium and
other hard-to-get metals by imprisoning
the molten metal inside a cage of its
own making. The process, called cage
zone refining, uses a unique method to
melt a bar of metal while the metal acts
as its own crucible, thus preventing con-
tamination by any containing vessel. Ob-
ject of the process is to prepare super-
pure metals.
The new technique was developed by
P. H. Brace, consulting metallurgist; Dr.
A. W. Cochardt of the metallurgy depart-
ment; and Dr. George Oomenetz, advis-
ory engineer to the metallurgical consult-
ing staff of the Laboratories.

gaining will be priceless in producing the
supersonic airplanes and guided missiles
of the future. These men explore the
frontiers of engineering knowledge in
rocket and nuclear propulsion, in ex-
tremes of vibration, temperature and
pressure and in many other fields.
Boeing engineers are members of avia-

FIGURE the facts yourself. Only
40% as many pounds of metal are
needed to build a machine part from
steel as from cast iron. Furthermore,
each pound of steel costs a third
as much as iron. As a result, basic
material costs using steel are about
15% of the costs using cast iron.
The large initial saving in material
cost makes it possible to fabricate
machine designs from steel at sub-

melted progressively from one end to
the other, has become a standard process
for purifying certain metals," Dr. Comen-
etz said. "In transistor research here at
the Laboratories, for example, it is used
routinely to prepare germanium metal
having impurities of about one part in
10,000,000,000. Our new technique ap-
plies this valuable refining process to
metals which are so active at high tem-
peratures that they react with any cruci-
ble in which we could heat them."
Commenting on the significance of the
new development, Dr. Clarence Zener,
associate director of the Research Labora-
tories and manager of the metallurgy
department, declared, "the metallurgy of
many important metals such as titanium
is still in its infancy. Much basic research
on these pure metals is needed before
we can begin to realize their potential
applications. We hope this new refining
method will enable us to speed such re-
search by providing increased quantities
of those metals which are especially diffi-
cult to prepare in a highly-purified
state."
In one variation of the new Westing-
house process, a round bar is machined
so that several ridges or fins run length-
wise along its surface, much like those
on the fluted columns of certain build-
ings, These unmelted ridges then form
the cage, and since they can be placed
at will, they permit longer bars of larger
diameter to be purified. The Westing-
house scientists foresee the technique
being applied to bars as much as three
inches in diameter and of any desired
length.

The growing interest in weather and climate as factors in everyday life has led to a corresponding de-
mand for education and research in applied meteorology. The University program in this area has develop-
ed dapidly in the past several years under the guidance of the Department of Civil Engineering. Eleven
courses in meteorology are now being offered, a degree of Master of Science in Meteorology has been
established, a teaching and research meteorological laboratory has been built on the roof off the East
Engineering Building, and a comprehensive research program is under way.
Meteorology is important in many engineering problems, such as: air pollution; dynamic wind loading
of structures; snow loading of structures; flood forecasting; transportation by air, water, highways, and
rail; cooling tower design; heating, ventilating, and air conditioning; weathering of building materials;
and many others.
Ragweed allergy as a problem n public health engineering is receiving increased attention. The photo-
graph shows student assistants in research operating automatic volumetric samplers and an anemometer
on the roof of the East Engineering Building for a study of the space distribution of fragweed pollen con-
centrations. Research is also being conducted on the penetration of small particles into buildings, on dy-
namic wind loading of structures, and on industrial air pollution.

MIDNIGHT MEMOS
The managing editor has just informed me that
I'm a week overdue on my editorial. As far as I'm
concerned the biggest headache an editor has is try-
ing to think up a high-class discourse on a worn-out
subject for his exciting monthly column. Can't seem
to think of anything exciting right now so you'll
just have to go unstimulated this month.
Somehow most people have the idea that the edi-
torial is a reformation column but this is foolish be-
cause an editor often needs as much reforming as a
reader. Besides the people who badly need reforming
usually are very happy in their "conduct unbecoming
a University student" ways and are very reluctant
to change. Thinking back over some of the happier
times I've had on campus, I am inclined to sym-
pathize with them. It would be very easy to write
a reformation column for this campus since I noticed
in the D. O. B. that about 29 out of 31 Joint Judi-
ciary cases concern alcoholic beverages. All I
would have to do is cut out a few columns of a
temperance league monthly that is sent to us (never
could figure out why). This would probably
do little towards solving the problem though as
it is extremely narrow in scope seeing only the
white of abstension and the black of indulging. An-
other easy editorial would be to lambast the admin-
istration for paternalism, but again this offers no
solution as the administration is just enforcing state
laws. Ahah! the state legislature is the fiend. Un-
doubtedly many of the problems that arise at the
University concerning drinking are a result of John
Doe coming from the state of Podunk where he's
been drinking legally since 18. Then he comes to
Michigan and all of a sudden he's become too young
to drink. This seems kind of silly to John Doe and I
can't exactly blame him when he rebels. One of the
states is wrong but which is it?
How do they explain the fact that the mere cross-
ing of a state line changes one's maturity? The key
to the situation probably lies in the comparative
strengths of the breweries and dairies in the various
states. No other logical explanation seems to be
available. This is a bad state of affairs as (1) the law
is determined by powerful private interests, and (2)
the states can't agree on a uniform policy.
The solution would be either to have Congress
pass a law or for all the states to get together and
decide on a compromise age which would be uni-
form throughout the country. This would undoubt-
edly be a hard task but the reduction in confusion
and violations would be well worth it.

speaks from experience when he says,
"AtU.S. Steel, the opportunities are unlimited."
Bob Blake had his first experience in
steel mills working there during sum-
mer vacations from college. After re-
ceiving his B.S. degree in Electrical
Engineering, he became an operating
trainee in U.S. Steel's Irvin Works.
During his training program, his
background and versatility were used
by the Training Division to develop
a training program for Electrical
Maintenance employees. By the end
of 1951, Mr. Blake had become a
Foreman with experience in both
Cold Reduction Maintenance and
the Galvanizing Department.
Effort is made to have young engi-
neers obtain varied experience be-
fore devoting themselves to one field.
Mr. Blake feels that, "An engineer-
ing graduate has practically no ceil-
ing provided he has the right attitude
and is willing."
Promoted again in 1954, Mr. Blake
is now Foreman—Electric Shop in
Central Maintenance. Supervising a
crew of 40 men, he is responsible for
electrical construction work, mainte-
nance and crane wiring. Mr. Blake
feels he is in "an interesting and
challenging field of work." He has
found that "U.S. Steel is a highly de-
sirable employer in this most basic
of all industries."

It is generally conceded that Engine school lacks
two things: girls and school spirit. Since I have
enough trouble getting and handling girls for my-
self alone, I will not attempt to solve the problem
for 2700 horny engineers.
School spirit is indirectly involved with many
ideas which are now being considered by the engine
council. Engine school elections—the engine ering
newsletter—changing of the class board structure
from Freshman Board, Soph Board, etc., to one of
class of '59, class of '60 etc.—an Engineers weekend
which would include the Slide Rule Ball, Open
House and perhaps a mass outing.
All of these projects are aimed at offsetting the
"me I'm a number" effect of the increasing enroll-
ment by making the engineers a closely knit group
with plenty of spirit. Undoubtedly if successful, the
above will serve to greatly increase school spirit.
For that reason alone, I would say back these pro-
jects to the hilt.
This however is not enough. It seems to me that
we need to go a little further and organize the
engineers into one group—an Engineers Club.
The formation of this club would facilitate
doing away with splinter groups such as depart-
mental societies. This would do away with the
troubles arising from year to year variation in the
membership and officers. It is easy to see the diffi-
culties that arise in representation and participation
in college and engine council affairs when a society
drops from fifty to five in one year. Besides this
difficulty, the fact that many men who specialize in
one field may end up in another, makes it an
advantage to tie the different types of engineering a
little closer together while you are still in school.
Continuity of this one club would be much easier
to maintain than that of ten or more societies. School
spirit would be multiplied many times by having
a strong and well organized club to which engineers
would belong from orientation to graduation. Other
schools have taken this step and have been very
successful. At the University of Oklahoma, for in-
stance, the Engineers' club practically runs the
school.
The formation of an Engineers' Club on campus
would facilitate all of the above projects, give the
solid block of engineering students a bigger voice
in Engine school and University affairs, and add the
spirit so sorely needed.

You'll grow better in
Engineering Soil
How well rooted you are in later life depends a lot on
where you plant your abilities after graduation. Oppor-
tunities should certainly be greater wherever engineering
is the foundation or life-blood of a business—as it is in
Bendix Aviation Corporation.
iSow—not after you graduate—is the time to investi-
gate what Bendix and other companies have to offer
young engineers.
At Bendix, the emphasis is always on better engi-
neering, more and more research, as evidenced by a
$100 million expenditure this year in these phases of
the business.
The case for Bendix is essentially this: It is a large
engineering and manufacturing firm with twenty-four
individually operated plants from coast to coast. It
makes over a thousand products—components, sub-
systems or complete systems—for all the basic indus-
tries, aviation, automotive, military, marine, railroad,
etc.
The broad line of engineering products means
broader and more diversified engineering talents are
employed here than anywhere else. There is plenty of
room to grow, to gain experience and to prosper. And
individual divisions are small enough so you won't get
"lost in the shuffle".

Cringing under the overseer's lashing
whip, swarms of straining men pulled
and sweated under the hot Mediterranean
sun, adding their muscles to the brains
of the engineers in the construction of
man's oldest and possibly greatest monu-
ments, the Pyramids of Egypt. Sixty or
seventy of these structures, which were
built during the IV Dynasty, (3733
B.C.), through the XIV Dynasty, (2200
B.C.), still survive and offer mute testi-
mony to the ingenuity of their builders.
The Pharaoh's engineers utilized various
progressive construction methods, some
of which remain time-shrouded mysteries,
in the erection of their massive monu-
ments. The ultimate height of advance-
ment was probably reached in the three
pyramids at Gizeh. Best known of these
structures is the Great Pyramid of
Cheops, whose immense bulk and enig-
matic construction methods earned it
recognition as one of the seven wonders
of the ancient world.
Tribute must be given to the ancient
engineers if only for the size of their
undertakings. Covering thirteen and one
half acres, the Great Pyramid is large
enough to include Westminster's Abbey,
London's St. Pauls Cathedral, and St.
Peter's Cathedral in Rome. The great
pyramid originally reached to a height
of 481 feet and covered a distance of about
756 feet on each side of the base. If
masons sawed the estimated 2,300,000
separate blocks, into one foot cubes, a
line of such blocks would stretch two
thirds of the distance around the equator.
However, more impressive than size,
is the degree of accuracy attained by the
builders. Each side of the pyramid lies
in line with the four cardinal directions
of north, south, east and west, and the
opening of the entrance points directly
to the North Star. The dimensions of the
pyramid itself indicate painstaking meas-
urements. The longest of the four sides
is 9,073 inches, the shortest is 9,065.1,
showing that the Egyptian engineers kept
within allowances of closer than 1/1,000
of an inch. While the Egyptians were
able to attain accurate dimensions with
measuring cords, they were prevented
from using such direct methods when lay-
ing out the corner angles due to a solid
core of rock which rises into the center
of the Great Pyramid. Still, using only
visual measuring methods, the engineers
managed to hold the 90° corner angles
within three and one half minutes of a
degree. Another feat of the builders' skill
is the precision which went into the actual
masonry work. The joints of the outer
limestone covering gap at less than 1/50
of an inch, preventing insertion of even
a thin blade into the casing.
Limestone Used
The casing of the majority of the pyra-
mids originally consisted of fine white
limestone, but through the years the
monuments lost most of their smooth
outer sheath to pillaging builders of later-
day structures. This limestone, which was
also used to line the passageways and
chambers, came chiefly from the Tura

Nile about 12 miles distant from the
Gizeh pyramids. Coarse limestone com-
posed the bulk of the pyramids and was
usually obtained in the immediate vicin-
ity of the construction.
The engineers also employed granite
in their structure. This hard material
found use not only for the important
parts of the interior that were subject to
stress, such as roof spans over the cham-
bers, but also as outer casing for a few
pyramids. A hard reddish casing of
granite can still be seen covering the
smallest of the Gizeh group, Mycerunus.
However, part of it remains in a rough
state, probably because of the excessive
effort needed for finishing. The Egyptians
brought their granite chiefly from Aswan,
several hundred miles up the Nile.
Transportation
Quarrying the stone blocks was only
part of the problems confronting the
builders, for the material needed trans-
portation to the building site. The
solving of this transportation problem re-
mains as one of the greatest accomplish-
ments of the Egyptians since some of the
stone blocks reached weights of 60
tons. Their methods are revealed in an-
cient inscriptions which depict laborers
dragging the huge blocks on rough
wooden sleds. Also shown, are men carry-
ing short pieces of wood which were
cither rollers or boards flattened and
smoothed on one side to decrease fric-
tion for the runners. Men pouring oil
or water in front of the sled further re-
duced the sliding friction.
Transportation was additionally aided
by one of the most basic of all machines,
the inclined plane. An inclined causeway,
the remains of which are still visible,
stretched the half mile from the Tura
Quarry to the River Nile. The Egyptian
engineers constructed other long cause-
ways from the Nile to the 100 foot
plateau upon which the three Gizeh pyra-
mids were located. The construction of
these hard surfaced roadways constituted
a task nearly as involved as the erection
of the pyramids themselves. According to
Herodotus, the Roman historian, the in-
clined causeway leading to the Great Pyra-
mid took 10 years to build. Originally it
was 3,000 feet long, 60 feet wide, and 104
feet high, but as the pyramid progressed
in height, the plane's height was also in-
creased. Although these causeways pri-
marily served to facilitate transportation
of building materials, they were also part
of the religious processions and artists
thus provided appropriate decorations.
The water transportation was by means
of the Nile River boats built with high
bows and sterns. The inclined planes ex-
tended to the water's edge and, contrary
to Hollywood, the stones were dragged
directly on and off the boats without the
use of block and tackle.
Long causeways and boat transporta-
tion were required because of the location
of the pyramids. Probably as a result of
the religious significance which the Egyp-
tians attributed to the setting sun, the
pyramids were located on the west bank
of the Nile. However, the transportation
of building materials was facilitated by
the high waters of the annual Nile flood,

a shorter distance of the pyramids and
quarries.
Construction Preparation
The usefulness of the River Nile was
not confined merely to transportation
of the blocks; water was also of im-
portance in the leveling of the pyramid
site. Embankments were erected along
the perimeter of the base and the result-
ing enclosure was filled with water.
Laborers then dug numerous pits, at vari-
ous points throughout the base, to a se-
lected depth below the water level. The
bottoms of these pits were then all at the
same level and thus served as guides for
the removal of the remaining rock. This
method of leveling sometimes lacked ac-
curacy, for measurements of the Great
Pyramid show that the plane slopes about
six inches from the NW to SE. This
error could easily be caused by a NW
breeze piling the water in one corner. The
site was not always completely leveled,
for the egineers built the Great Pyramid
around a core of rock left in the center
of the base.
After leveling the foundation to their
requirements, the engineers then began
work on the substructure, hewing from
the rock the sections of passages and
chambers which were to lie below ground
lelevl. At this time, before the rest of the
pyramid was built, the tomb chamber was
dug and the sarcophagus was placed into
the chamber. (These stone coffins, which
weighed up to 18 tons, were probably
symbolic and according to Mr. E. E.
Peterson, director of the University's
Kelsy Museum of Archaeology, they were
probably used to mislead robbers. It was
also stated that, contrary to popular be-
lief, no bodies of mummys have yet been
found in a sarcophagus or even in a
pyramid proper.)
After the sarcophagus lid was lowered
in place with ropes, the chamber and
other parts of the substructure and in-
terior were walled, paved, and roofed.
With the substructure completed, the
causeway was finished and work on the
pyramid superstructure began.
Development of Pyramid Forms
Basically the form of the pyramid
superstructure evolved from the brick
mastabas which were used as tombs in
earlier Egyptian Dynasties. In appearance

these mastabas look similar to several
truncated pyramids placed on top of each
other with the bottom pyramid being
both the largest in base area and the
shortest in height. Rising from the base
for a distance equal to about half of the
total height of mastaba is another trun-
cated pyramid, considerably smaller in
base area. On top of this second form
stands an even smaller truncated pyramid.
From these primative tombs, the engi-
neers eventually developed the step pyra-
mid by adding additional sloping walls
to the main structure of the mastaba. The
true pyramid then evolved from the step

By BOB BEDESKI, A.E.'59
These past ten years have been a monu-
mental decade in aeronautical progress.
Within this short span of time we have
seen such wonders as regularly scheduled
intercontinental flight become reality.
Level flight at supersonic speeds is stand-
ard operational procedure with aircraft
such as the new North American F-100
Super Sabre. Today's aircraft are flying
faster, higher, further and more effi-
ciently than ever before.
As is almost universally recognized to-
day, this phenomenal rate of progress is
not due to any prodigious growth in any
particular science. But rather, each field
of endeavor must be kept abreast of the
others.
A new development in propulsion, for
example, will have no practical applica-
tion until engineers in the associated
fields have evaluated this new develop-
ment and interpreted it in relation to
their own particular fields.
This hypothetical development in pro-
pulsion, for instance, would probably
pose many problems for the aerodynam-
icist, chemist, and metallurgist. Until the
problems relevant to each of these fields
have been solved, this development can
not be incorporated into aircraft design.
Departing from hypothesis and into
actuality, we have many instances in
which this principle holds true. It would
be foolhardy to deny that aircraft cor-
porations possess designs for configura-
tions capable of flying much faster than
they do now. And what's more, they
probably have the engines to propel them
and the necessary fuel. What is holding
them back then? If you have a design,
an engine and a fuel, isn't it only a short
step before the plane is actually flying
and in production?
Unfortunately, no. Before it is possible
to construct anything, materials are need-
ed. When one is dabbling in the field of
supersonics, these materials are too often
non-existent. It is a problem much great-
er than selecting from the available ma-
terials a substance which will give best
results.
The stresses acting on an experimental
rocket missile traveling at Mach 3 arc-
quite different than those acting on a
Piper Cub cruising at 120 mph. There-
fore the demands placed upon the con-
struction materials will be vastly different.
Through experimentation, it has been
found that the outside of an aircraft be-
comes heated to high temperatures ex-
tremely rapidly when flying at supersonic
speeds—so rapidly that the skin is un-
able to diffuse the heat fast enough. The
result is that the exterior temperature of
the skin is often several hundred degrees
higher than the interior. If ordinary
metals were used, this condition would
cause severe buckling of the skin and
perhaps even rupture. Severe buckling
would affect the aerodynamical perform-
ance to an appreciable extent and total
rupture would be disastrous.
Problems such as these have given rise
to a whole new branch of metallurgical
research—creep testing. This field is de-
voted to the obtaining of data concerning
the properties of metals at high tempera-
ture and to improving these properties.
Creep in a metal is the elongation
which occurs when a constant load is ap-
plied. This creep is measured in terms of
per cent elongation per unit time. In
practice, this particular elongation is
synonymous with creep.
When a specimen is subjected to a
creep test, it undergoes three transient
phases before rupturing. The first is
designated as the primary phase. During
this time, elastic and plastic deformations
take place almost simultaneously. When
the test enters the secondary phase, the
rate of elongation is reduced greatly and
is linear. Approaching the point of rup-
ture, the specimen undergoes a third,
or tertiary stage of elongation in which
the rate of creep is very high and con-

tinuous at this rate until the point of rup-
ture is reached.
Many factors are involved in deter-
mining the manner in which a certain
metal will react to creep testing. Compo-
sition, heat treatment, and the tempera-
ture at which the test is conducted are
things to be considered when testing a
metal.
Here at the University of Michigan, a
major research project is presently in
progress to extend science's knowledge
in the area of creep phenomena.
This project was originally sponsored
by the Timken Steel Company in 1929
for the purspose of obtaining informa-
tion about the company's steel at high
temperatures. Over the years, many cor-
porations and organizations have spon-
sored research projects using Michigan's
facilities.
Within the building, which is situated
to the north of North Hall, 124 indi-
vidual furnaces are placed in rows and
have individual temperature controllers
mounted on a wall perpendicular to the
rows. The furnaces are aluminum cylin-
ders about the size of a potato-chip can.
They are operated electrically, and when
all furnaces are in operation, they use
about one-third of the total electricity on
the campus.
These tests are conducted over periods
of time ranging from a few minutes to
20,000 hours. The average test, however,
is run for 100 to 200 hours and the
results are exterpolated to compute effects
for longer periods of time.
In measuring elongation, optical exten-
someters are used which give an accur-
acy of 2.8 millionths of an inch per inch
of gauge length.
At present, the University is working
in conjunction with the National Advis-
ory Committee on Aeronautics at the
Wright Air Development Center of the
U. S. Air Force. One test is being con-

UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
POWER PLANT
Throughout the country colleges and
universities are facing rapid increase in
enrollment. To meet the evergrowing in-
flux of students, our university has ex-
panded its facilities for instruction. Sev-
eral classroom buildings and at least one
residence hall are scheduled for comple-
tion in the near future.
As the central source of heat and elec-
trical power for the campus, the univer-
sity power plant is faced with the prob-
lem of servicing the new buildings. At
present the plant heats eleven residence
halls, a 60-bed Health Service infirmary
and the 1064-bed University Hospital
besides classroom buildings. Peaks of
steam generation up to 380,000 lbs. for
one hour have heated the campus during
the long winter months. With the com-
pletion of new buildings this peak out-
put is expected to be upped to 400,000
lbs. steam per hour.
Also placing great demands on the
power plant is the generation of electric-
ity. The output of four generators is
supplemented by power from Detroit Edi-
son to provide electricity up to 10,000

kilowatts for one hour. Other services
furnished by the plant are hot-water,
compressed air for labs, and extra-soft
water for hospitals and other campus in-
stitutions that would profit by using less
soap.
The red brick building which houses
the steam generating unit fills in the dis-
tance between Huron and Washington
streets near Palmer Field. A railroad sid-
ing runs parallel to the plant, cutting
right through the coal yard. Between the
stockpile and the plant is the crane. The
coal dumped from the railroad cars into
the yard is picked up by the crane and
lifted above to the bunkers which run
along the top of the building and are
directly above the hoppers. About sixteen
carloads (1120 tons of coal are unloaded
daily. The bunker has a capacity of 920
tons.
As mentioned above, producing steam
for heat is the chief purpose of the plant.
Seven boilers are used. The two oldest
boilers were installed in 1924. Rated at
1000 h.p., they each produce about
(S3,000 lbs, steam per hour. They are of
the single drum horizontal tube type.
Two more boilers, dated at 1930, have a
builder's rating of 1,000 h.p. and gener-
ate 75,000 lbs of steam per hour. Number
seven boiler installed in 1939 is rated at
1500 boiler horsepower and can produce
a maximum of 125,000 lbs. of steam
per hour. This boiler is equipped with
partial water walls. The year 1948 saw
the installation of the first boiler with
economizer and full water walls. Rated at
1700 h.p., it can generate 125,000 lbs.
continuously and 150,000 lbs. operating
at maximum for a period of four hours.
The latest addition to the boiler room
will be tried out this month. The new
three drum bent tube boiler will produce
approximately the same amount of heat
as its immediate predecessor yet is rated
at 1950 h.p. This is because a Foster-
Wheeler superheater raises the heat of
the steam far above the temperature cor-
responding to its pressure of 400 lbs. It
is interesting to note that solder is used
in the thermometer attached to the boil-
ers—mercury boils away and oil burns!

Use of the transistor in Bell telephones
Shown here are the parts of the small amplifying unit in Western Electric's
new Volume Control Telephone.
Because of the use of a transistor (shown above, extreme left on index
finger) this amplifying unit is no larger than an ice cube and can fit
inside the housing of a standard telephone.
Manufacturing of transistors on a commercial basis represents a solid
engineering achievement... for it means volume production of an item that
must be made under rigidly controlled laboratory conditions. For example,
harmful impurity atoms in the germanium must be reduced to tess
than I for every 10,000,000,000 germanium atoms and then helpful
impurity atoms added until there is approximately 1 for every 50,000,000
germanium atoms.
Western Electric has been making transistors since 1951 when our
engineers set up the first commercial production line. This history-making
achievement is representative of the way we work as the manufacturing
unit of the Bell System... translating Bell System designs and inventions
into the many things —from tiny semi-conductors to huge switching
systems —used in the nationwide Bell telephone network.
It's a job that presents an unending challenge to our engineering staff.

WU. S." electrical wires and(
In Cable Testing, Part I (No. 9 in the series) this subject was out-
lined in a general way and Factory Tests on Entire Lengths were
discussed in somewhat greater detail. Part II concludes this subject
and discusses (in some detail) sample and miscellaneous tests
made at the factory and tests after installation.
SAMPLE TESTS
These tests, as the name indicates, are made on short samples
selected at any stage during manufacture or from the completed
cable.
CONDUCTOR TESTS. Dimensional tests, tensile strength, elongation
and quality of coating tests are made on the conductor to insure
that the processing operations have been performed properly and
that the conductor will meet the specification requirements.
INSULATION AND JACKET THICKNESS. The minimum and average
thickness of insulations and jackets are determined by suitable
micrometers or micrometer microscopes to determine compliance
with the thickness requirements.
PHYSICAL TESTS. These tests determine the tensile strength, elonga-
tion, tensile stress and set of rubber and rubber-like or thermo-
plastic insulation and jacket compounds. Tensile strength and
elongation are measured at the breaking point. Tensile strength
in pounds per square inch is calculated from the cross-sectional
area of the original test specimen. Elongation is expressed in per
cent of the unstretched length. Tensile stress is the tension in
pounds per square inch required to elongate a sample a given
amount, usually 200 per cent. Set is a measure of the recovery
after a specified elongation.
AGING TESTS. These are accelerated tests in which the effect of
heat and/or increased oxygen concentration on the tensile strength
and elongation of insulations and jackets is determined. The results
of such tests indicate the temperature (conductor temperature) at
which such insulations or jackets will operate continuously and
their life-expectancy at higher temperatures. For example, an in-
sulation that shows not more than 25 per cent depreciation in
tensile strength and elongation after 96 hours in the oxygen bomb
at 70° C is suitable for continuous operation at 60° C while an
insulation that shows not more than 25 per cent depreciation in
these characteristics after 168 hours in the oxygen bomb at 80° C
is suitable for operation at 75° C.
Electrical tests, such as voltage breakdown, insulation resistance,
power factor, etc., are frequently made during the development
of insulating compounds to determine the effect of such aging on
these properties. Such tests, however, are generally not covered
by industry specifications.
MOISTURE ABSORPTION. The effect of moisture on the properties
of insulations is important, particularly where they are exposed
directly to water in service. Moisture absorption is determined by
the gravimetric method and by the electrical method. In the gravi-
metric method a suitable sample is weighed, immersed in distilled
water for 7 days at 70° C and reweighed. The gain in weight is
expressed in milligrams per square inch of exposed surface. In the
electrical method, the sample is immersed in water at 50° C and
its capacitance is determined after one, seven, and fourteen days.
The increases in capacitance from the first to the fourteenth and the
seventh to the fourteenth days are a measure of moisture absorbed.
No. 10 in a series


OZONE RESISTANCE. To determine the effect of ozone on insula-
tions or jackets, a sample is bent around a mandrel of such diameter
that the material under test is stretched about 15 per cent and then
exposed to an atmosphere containing ozone at room temperature.
One of two concentrations of ozone, namely 0.013 or .027 per
cent is used, depending on the type of insulation. Acceptable insu-
lations must withstand such exposure for a specified time without
cracking. Ozone resistance is generally required only on those com-
pounds designed for operation at above 5001 volts.
CAPACITY AND POWER FACTOR. The dielectric constant and power
factor are important characteristics of insulations designed for use
on high-voltage power circuits or on most communication circuits
since they are a measure of the energy absorbed by such insulations.
The dielectric constant is calculated from capacity measurements
on a sample of known dimensions. For high-voltage cables, these
measurements are made at the operating voltage of the cable at a
frequency of 60 cycles after immersion in water for 24 hours. For
communication cables, the measurements are generally made at
1000 cycles with about 20 volts applied to the insulation.
DIELECTRIC STRENGTH TEST. Samples of insulated cables designed
for operation at voltages above 5001 volts are required to with-
stand for five minutes the application of a voltage twice the factory
test voltage after immersion in water for at least one hour. Follow-
ing this test, the voltage on the sample is increased 20 per cent and
held for five minutes. This cycle is repeated until breakdown occurs
and the breakdown voltage recorded for information only.
COLD BENDING AND LONG-TIME DIELECTRIC STRENGTH. Samples
of cables designed for operation at voltages above 5001 are re-
quired to withstand bending at —10° C around a mandrel approxi-
mately ten times the cable diameter followed by the application of
the factory test voltage for two hours. This test insures that the
insulation and jacket have the required flexibility to withstand
bending during installation.
MISCELLANEOUS TESTS. Numerous additional tests are required by
specifications for wires and cables to determine their suitability for
their particular applications. The more important of these include,
abrasion, compression, cutting, low-temperature, tear and weather-
ing tests on insulation and jacket compounds, and abrasion, bend-
ing, compression, flame and twist tests on completed cables. The
results of such tests are of great value in the design of new types of
wires and cables.
TESTS AFTER INSTALLATION
Wire and cable industry practice permits the application of an a-C
voltage equal to 80 per cent of the factory test voltage for five
minutes to metallic-armored, lead-sheathed or shielded cables im-
mediately after installation. For proof-testing 75 per cent of the
factory test voltage may be used. When a d-c test is used, its value
for ozone-resistance insulation is three times the a-c value.

. . . Whether there was a real Mother
Goose?
Sorry to disappoint all nursery rhyme
lovers, but Mother Goose was a real per-
son. The nursery jingles we know as the
rhymes of Mother Goose existed hundreds
of years ago as part of our American folk-
lore. In 1719, T. Fleet of Boston, Massa-
chusetts made a collection of these folk
tales and published them under the title
Songs for the Nursery; or Mother Goose's
Melodies for Children. The publisher at
first refused to accept the works for pub-
lication, but Mr. Fleet's mother-in-law
proved their value by singing them to his
little boy, this mother-in-law's name was
Mrs. Goose, after whom Mr. Fleet named
the collection.
. . . How long people have used forks?
The first fork was developed from the
three-pronged fishing spear and was very
crude. The first known fork had two
prongs or tines and was used for cook-
ing and for holding meat while it was
carved. Noble and wealthy Venetians of
the eleventh century used forks for this
purpose and King Charles V of France
had a few for his own personal use in the
fourteenth century, but forks with which
to eat food did not become known in
Great Britain until as late as the seven-
teenth century.
. . . How the days got their names?
The decision to have seven days in a
week resulted from early wise men who
could see only five planets. They believed
the sun and the moon to be planets, too,
making seven in all. Sunday was the sun's
day, Monday the moon's day, Tuesday
was named after Tiw, the Norse God
of War, Wednesday was named after
the Saxon God Woden, Thursday after
the Norse God Thor, Friday after the
Saxon Goddess Freya, and Saturday was
Saturn's day.
. . . When newspapers first began?
News carved in stone began as early as
about 700 B.C., but the newspaper in its
modern form is usually regarded as be-
ginning in 1566, when the government of
Venice, Italy, issued written news sheets
and exhibited them in the streets. Anyone-
was allowed to read them on payment
of a small coin called a gazella. From this,
the newspapers were soon called gazettes,
and they became so popular that they
were printed instead of hand-written. The
gazettes soon spread all over Europe. The
first English newspaper was the Weekly
News, published in London in 1622.
There was no local news in any of these
papers. They carried only foreign news
until 1641.
. . . Why old sign writings are called
"heiroglyphics"?
The figures drawn to represent words,
syllables, or sounds were first found on
the temples and palaces of Egypt in 1799,
but had been written and forgotten many-
centuries ago. In that year, a stone was
found which carried a message in three
languages: Egyptian, old Greek, and the
picture writing. The mysterious picture
writing came to be called "heiroglyphics,"
which is made up of two Greek words
meaning "sacred carvings."
. . . Where we got our alphabet?
It was the Phoenicians who perfected
the first practical alphabet. They did not
invent the signs they used in their alpha-
bet, but took the simplest signs from an
earlier system of picture writing and used
them to represent the sounds of the hu-
man voice. The Phoenicians taught their
new system to the Greeks, who changed
it somewhat and added signs for the
vowel sounds which the Phoenicians had
not used. The name of the first Greek
letter is alpha and the second beta—thus
the word "alphabet."
Ball Bearing
Talk about a "quiz whiz"...here's the ball
bearing torque tester that's in a class by itself!
This Fafnir-developed torque testing equipment for
instrument ball bearings automatically records a continu-
ous series of starting torque peaks from which maximum
torque, average torque, and the frequency distribution
of successive torque peaks are quickly determined. In
addition, the trace distinctly reveals how torque is affected
by dirt, race finish, race geometry, load, scratches, nicks,
and retainer condition. By providing a multiplicity of
readings in a very short span of time, inspection is
simplified and chances of error minimized.
The development of a better means of measuring
instrument bearing torque is but one of many Fafnir

ALUMINUM INDUSTRY
WAS BORN ON
SMALLMAN
STREET
Alcoa's new
aluminum office
building
^ In 1888, the aluminum industry consisted of one company—
located in an unimpressive little building on the east side of
Pittsburgh. It was called The Pittsburgh Reduction Company.
The men of this company had real engineering abilities and
viewed the work to be done with an imagineering eye. But
they were much more than that. They were pioneers ...
leaders . . . men of vision.
A lot has happened since 1888. The country ... the
company . . . and the industry have grown up. Ten new
territories have become states, for one thing. The total
industry now employs more than 1,000,000 people—
and the little outfit on Smallman Street? Well, it's a lot
bigger, too—and the name has been changed to Alcoa.
Aluminum Company of America . . . but it's still the
leader—still the place for engineering "firsts".
As you prepare to trade textbooks for a position in
industry, consider the advantages of joining a
dynamic company like Alcoa—for real job stability
and pleasant working conditions—where good
men move up fast through their association with
the recognized leaders in the aluminum industry.
We have fine positions for college graduate
engineers—in our plants, sales offices and
research laboratories from coast to coast.
These are positions of responsibility in
production supervision, plant and design
engineering, industrial research or sales
engineering. Right now it may be
quicker than you think from a seat in
the classroom to your career with
Alcoa. Why not find out?
Your Placement Director will be
glad to make an appointment for

pyramid by filling in the steps with cas-
ing blocks to form a smooth surfaced
true pyramid.
Structure
Actually, the pyramids were not con-
structed, as popularly conceived, by mere-
ly piling layers of rock on each other,
but rather by utilizing a series of internal
faces. Examination of partially destroyed
pyramids shows that the structure fea-
tured an inner core of rough limestone,
encased by a face of fine limestone, with
a series of increasingly wider but shorter
faces built against the core. At this stage
of construction, a pyramid would appear
stepped, but in more advance structures,
the entire form was sheathed in a layer
of casing stones. Thus, the masonry of a
pyramid can be divided into four classes,
which include, (1) the basic core which
lies between the successive internal, or
accretion faces, (2) the internal faces
of fine limestone, all of which slope at
the same angle, (3) the packing blocks
between the outermost internal faces, or
steps, and the casing blocks, and (4) the
fine limestone casing blocks.
Construction
Since the masonry of the pyramids in-
volves such large numbers of huge stone
blocks, the most puzzling question is
how the Egyptians constructed their mas-
sive monuments. No records or descrip-
tions of the actual construction have been
found, but traces of the inclined cause-
ways leading to the pyramids still remain.
The structure of the pyramids, as previ-
ously described with an inner core and
numerous internal faces, might indicate
that the pyramids were built in stages,
by first constructing the core, and then
the face around the core and finally, the
external casing. This method of con-
struction would require the building of
inclined planes, or ramps, against the
core and each face, with the dismantling
and shifting of the embankments as the
layers of stone were successively widened.
In some of the earlier examples of true
pyramids, each of the internal faces was
dressed true, and this method of con-
structing by stages was probably necessary
in order to expose a sufficient amount of
facing at a time for accurate measure-
ments.
Obviously this method wastes labor, a
practice seldom indulged in by the effi-
ciently organized Egyptians. In later
pyramids, the engineers simplified con-
struction by leaving the internal faces in
a rough condition. This allowed them to
eliminate the wasteful practice of con-
tinual construction and shifting of ramps.
Instead, the pyramids were built almost
layer by layer, with the angle of the in-
ternal faces being maintained accurately
by measuring inward from the outer
casing.
In building the pyramids course by
course, the engineers again took advant-
age of the inclined plane. A long cause-
way, which, as previously mentioned
stretched three thousand feet long for the
Great Pyramid, met the pyramid struc-
ture along on whole side. The other three
sides of the structure were covered by
sloping foothold embankments for the
workmen. While men and equipment
were brought up these foothold embank-
ments, other laborers dragged the huge
stones along the causeway to the pyramid,
where other workers wielded levers and
eased the blocks into position. No cement
was used to bind the blocks together, but
a mortar was often spread on the blocks
to reduce sliding friction.
As each course of blocks was built the
stones for the core, the inner faces, the
packing blocks and the casing were all
laid in place. Then the inclined plane
was built higher and work began on the
next course of stone. It was while the
courses were laid that the chambers and

that kind of double talk is that—
"16 Times Around the World, and Never
Off the Ground?"
It's like this. With Allison's entry into
the commercial airline field, there is a
need for flight data on turbo-prop engines
before they are put into regularly sched-
uled commercial service. In the absence of
actual data, Allison is running a 1000-hour
test schedule witha Model 501 turbo-prop
engine mounted on an outdoor test rig.
In reality, 1000 hours of flying time
represents about 16 times around the
earth, is the equivalent of about 4 months
of normal, commercial airline usage.
For this test, actual airline operating
schedules are used. This means that the
engine is run through complete cycles of
starting, ground idle, take-off, climb,
cruise and descent for landing, and the
cycle is repeated continuously 'round the
clock as the schedule simulates trips of
from 250 to 2500 mile blocks.
One of the young engineers who has
been working on the project from the
start is Donal J. Nolan, shown above at
the test instrument control panel. Don
is assistant chief, installation engineering
at Allison. After his graduation in '42
from Case Institute of Technology, he
came to General Motors in 1943 with a
degree in ME.
Commercial acceptance of the Allison
turbo-prop engine started with the pur-
chase of a quantity of Allison-powered
Lockheed Electras by American Airlines.
This initial purchase, plus plans of other
leading airlines to adopt the Electra,
opens a new chapter in the growth and
development of Allison Division of Gen-
eral Motors Corporation. Already a
leader in the design, development and
production of turbo-jet and turbo-prop
engines for military use, Allison is under-
way with a long-term engineering expan-
sion program covering advanced military
and commercial engine installations.
This $75,000,000 program, providing for
newest engineering and research facili-
ties, intensifies the immediate need for
engineers.

passages lying in the superstructure of
the Great Pyramid were probably form-
ed. The granite or fine limestone blocks
for the sides and floor were put in place,
with the aid of auxiliary ramps, and as
the courses of the main structure gained
in height, the passages and chambers
were extended and roofed. The inclined
causeway was gradually enlarged as the
pyramid extended upward until it reach-
ed a height of about two hundred feet
above the base. The heaviest blocks,
weighing 60 tons, were at this level, and
served to roof the king's chamber. Above
this level, the blocks become small
enough to be handled without an in-
clined plane.
Uncertainty still exists as to exactly
what methods the Egyptians used to raise
the blocks up from one course to another.
Herodotus vaguely describes a machine
built from short pieces of wood and
using his statements, many writers have
proposed that the Egyptians utilized some
type of lifting crane in both the construc-
tion of the pyramid and also in the load-
ing of boats. However, such a machine-
would be incapable of lifting the huge-
weights necessary. Furthermore no blocks
show traces of slots or grooves for ropes,
a requirement for the convenient handling
of stones. The use of block and tackle-
by the Egyptians is also questioned due
to their ignorance of the pulley. More-
likely, the Egyptians raised the stones by
the use of wooden rockers, which have
been recently discovered. The block was
lashed to the rocker which then was
rocked backward by levers. A wooden
wedge was inserted and the cradle was
rocked forward on the wedge. Another
wedge was inserted on the other side and
the cradle was then rocked back upon it.
The process of continual cradle rocking
and insertion of wedges resulted in the
gradual rise of the block until it reached
the level of the next highest course.
While the courses were being layed, a
means was needed to insure the preven-
tion of twist in the sides of the struc-
tures, and deviation from the pyramids'
true angle of fifty-two degrees with the
ground. Twist was prevented by estab-
lishing points outside the base of the
pyramid in line with both the diagonals
and axes and projecting the lines up the
embankment on to the course under con-
struction by using sighting poles or
plumb lines.
Lines were also used to check the ac-
curacy of the true angle. Since the angle
of rise was a distance of fourteen on a
horizontal distance of eleven, all/14 of
the length of the first course was laid
along the second layer of stone. From
these points, which become the facing
surfaces of the course, a square can be
established which was checked by meas-
uring its sides and ascertaining if it lay
upon the pyramids diagonals. The pre-
vention of the would-be square from de-
veloping into a rhombus was accom-
plished by projecting the axes and ascer-
taining that they passed through the mid-
dle of each side.
With the pyramid structure completed,
a task requiring twenty years for the
Great Pyramid, the workmen then had
the job of dressing the outer casing that
covered five acres on each side. Although
the limestone blocks composing the outer
sheath were partly fitted with each other
while still on the ground, the outer, slop-
ing face was not smooth finished until
set into position. Work proceeded down-
ward, with the causeway and foot-hold
embankments being gradually removed.
As it would be impossible to obtain the
almost perfect flatness of casing by hav-

A WHIRLPOOL SPIRALS into the inlet of a model pump. This unique picture shows
how air, a common cause of pumping trouble, was carried into the pump in ...
The Case of the Baffled Whirlpool
Some time ago, the report reached us that two
Worthington vertical turbine pumps installed by one
of our customers weren't working right. They deliv-
ered plenty of water, but vibrated badly and burned
out bearings.
The customer asked us to find the trouble fast.
After checking we knew the pumps were okay, so
Worthington Research had to answer him.
First thing we did was build a one-tenth scale
model of the customer's installation. The photo
shows what happened when we started pumping.
A whirlpool immediately formed between the water
surface and the pump inlet. Air, trapped in the whirl-
pool and carried into the pump, was the villain in
the case.
The solution came with experimentation. A simple
baffle arrangement in a side channel eliminated the
whirlpool—and the trouble-making air.
Chasing the gremlins from pump installations like
this, boosting the efficiency of heat transfer in air
conditioners, developing better seals for pumps and
compressors — these are all in the day's work for
Worthington's busy research engineers. At Worth-
ington, research ranks right alongside engineering,
production, and sales to develop better products for
all industry.

All of the units are Wickes boilers
built in Saginaw, Michigan, except the
latest which is a Murray boiler built in
Burlington, Iowa. A steam temperature
of 384° F. is shown by all the boilers
with the exception of the 1930 Wickes
(404° F.) and the Murray (750° F.).
That's hot!
We observed before that the coal is
transported from the Michigan Central
Railroad by a siding to the plant. The
crane hoists a full load at 170 feet per
minute to the bunker. The trolley, which
runs parallel to the trough-like bunker
runs at a rate of 200 feet per minute. The
unit is completed by the bridge which
travels 350 feet per minute.
Two traveling weigh lorries deliver the
fuel from the overhead bunkers into the
stoker hoppers at firing floor level. Each
lorry holds a maximum of 3,000 lbs.
Using a scale on the operating board, the
fireman measures off approximately
2,700 lbs. and then "chutes" it into the
stoker hopper.
Except for one Westinghouse, the stok-
ers used are six Taylor underfeeds. Con-
sisting of a series of rams the stokers
push the new coal into the furnace so
that the clinker and ash is forced to the
top and gradually to the back end of the
furnace. The movement of the refuse to
the rear end is made possible by the
steep slope of the stoker. In the newer
units the refuse is pushed over the end
of the grate and falls into the collector
hopper. Such units are called continuous
ash discharge stokers. In the case of the
older stokers, the ash is periodically
dumped into the ash hopper. In the base-
ment the vitreous ash is removed from
the collector hopper into cars which de-
liver it to the ash bunker. All ash is sold
to a contractor. It is used as a cinder
block aggregate, for driveways and as a
filler.
While we are on the subject of fuel
burning equipment, it should be noted
that pulverizers are not used. Although
they can use a wider range of fuels, they
present a problem in dust control and ash
disposal. The later would be very objec-
tionable in a residential area.
A system of fans speeds up boiler oper-
ation tremendously. Air for combustion
is supplied by forced draft fans. Four
such fans are driven by 60 h.p. motors
and two others are powered by two new
75 h.p. motors. The FD fans send the
regular air from the building right into
the furnace at a temperature of 75° F.
Two chimneys (250 ft. and 150 ft.)
provide ample draft to remove gases from
the furnaces. However, two of the fur-
naces rely upon induced draft fans to
remove the products of combustion.
These units are driven by a 200 h.p. and
a 250 h.p. motor.
Automatic Controls
The boilers are operated automatically.
All boilers are connected to the steam
header which transports the steam to the
turbines. Connected to the header is a
station-master which is sensitive to pres-
sure changes. The master sends out an
impulse or signal to the control board
of each of the large boiler units. The
impulse passes through "compensating
relays" which increase, decrease, or send

Blazing the Way for a New
Generation of Air Power
The most powerful turbojet engine in production is
blazing the way for a whole new generation of
American aircraft.
That engine is Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft's J-57,
the first turbojet to achieve an official rating in the
10,000-pound thrust class.
But the J-57 provides far more than extreme high
thrust. Its unique Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft design,
achieved after years of intensive research and engi-
neering, offers as well the low specific fuel consump-
tion so vital to jet-powered bombers and future
transports, plus the additional important factor of
fast acceleration.
The importance of the J-57 in America's air power
program is clearly shown by the fact that it is the
power plant for three of the new "century series"
fighters for the U. S. Air Force—North American's
F-100, McDonnell's F-101 and Convair's F-102-
as well as Boeing's B-52 heavy bomber. The Navy,
too, has chosen the J-57 for its most powerful attack
aircraft, the Douglas A3D, the Douglas F4D fighter
and for the Chance Vought F8U day fighter. And
the J-57 will power the Boeing 707 jet transport.
The J-57 is fully justifying the long years and
intensive effort required for its development, pro-
viding pace-setting performance for a new genera-
tion of American aircraft.
Engineering graduates who can see the challenge in this new generation, might well
consider a career with the world's foremost designer and builder of aircraft engines.

stoker feeds to produce the currents of
steam desired and at the same time regu-
late the best conditions for combustion.
Other indicators on the boiler control
panel are the draft gauges which show
windbox pressure, furnace draft, boiler
outlet draft, economizer outlet draft,
dust collector draft and stack draft. All
are measured in inches of water. While
they do not regulate boiler performance
automatically, these gauges guide the
operators in making manual adjustments.
Feedwater Heating
Of special interest in the steam plant
operation is the thorough feedwater treat-
ment system which is designed to handle
600,000 gallons of water per hour, rais-
ing feedwater temperature to 230° F.
before it enters the boilers. The system
not only pre-heats the water but deaerates
it.
The city water delivered to the plant
contains approximately five grains of
hardness per gallon. In order that these
minerals may be made soluble, the water
is passed into a sodium-zealite softener.
Two such softening tanks each handle
a maximum of 500 gallons per minute.
When the water leaves this phase, its
hardness is reduced to practically 0°.
From the softener the feedwater passes
into the hot wells where it mixes with
the condensate. The hot wells, situated in
the basement, have capacities or 2720 ft.a
and 1470 ft.3 A control valve regulates
the amount of make-up added to the con-
densate. The make-up water varies be-
tween 15% and 25% of the total feed-
water.
The next step in treating feedwater is
heating and deaerating. A Cochrane de-
aerating heater is used. Jets spray the
water into steam which condenses. The
heater not only raises feedwater tempera-
ture to within 1 or 2 degrees of the steam
temperature, but removes free gases and
minerals.

Combination Helicopter and Airplane
Development of a convertiplane—com-
bination helicopter and airplane—is be-
ing conducted by Bell Aircraft Corp.
under contract with the Air Force, it was
announced this week.
Designed to combine the best features
of the conventional airplane and heli-
copter, the convertiplane will supercede
present types of aircraft in many of their
present day uses.
"The term 'convertiplane'," R. L.
Lichten, Bell's convertiplane project
engineer, explained, "is used to describe
several new types of aircraft in which
helicopter-type lifting rotors are used to
provide direct lift for take-off, low speed
flight and normal or emergency landings.
"At some transition speed, 'conver-
sion' to high-speed configuration is ac-
complished. This involves disposition of
the rotors so as to avoid the aerody-
namic limitations of conventional rotors,
which hold down potential helicopter
maximum speeds to 150 mph. or less."
Three designs are now being developed
under USAF contracts. These will ac-
complish conversion in three different
ways. In the first, the unloaded rotor type,
the rotor continues to rotate in its nor-
mal position during all flight conditions.
However, rotor thrust is decreased to
zero, and rotor rotational speed is re-
duced in order to minimize rotor drag
and power consumption during high-
speed flight. Lift and propulsion in high-
speed flight are provided by a fixed
wing and propellers or jets.
In the retractable-rotor type, the third
conversion method, the rotor is braked
to a stop for high-speed flight with lift
load transferred to fixed wings. The
rotor is then partially or fully retracted
to reduce drag. Propulsion in high-speed
flight is provided by propellers or jets.
Each of the three types offers poten-
tial performance greatly superior to that
of equivalent helicopters and closely ap-
proaching that of equivalent airplanes.
The initial uses for convertiplanes now
under development will be military.
These aircraft provide the ideal vehicle
for reconnaissance, artillery observation,

boiler drums. One pumps 325 gallons per
minute at a 750 ft. head. Three other
pumps draw 600 gallons per minute
apiece at a 1400 ft. head. Two more
pumps are rated at 1000 gallons per min-
ute at a 600 ft. head.
Enroute to the boilers the water (in
the case of the two newest boilers) passes
through the economizer, an auxiliary
heater which uses outgoing flue gases to
heat water. Situated between the boilers
and the dust collector, the economizer is
simply that part of the system where the
many water tubes pass through the duct
carrying the hot gases. Thus the feed-
water absorbs heat which would other-
wise be wasted.
Once in the boiler, the water has not
completed its treatment by any means.
When water evaporates into steam all of
its impurities are left behind in the re-
maining water. A treatment of phosphate
applied in the boiler takes care of mag-
nesium and calcium minerals to some
extent. Since a chemical analysis of the
water is made at least once a day. The
boiler is then blown down to settle out

the impurities, the number of times de-
pending on the results of analysis.
• Electricity Is a By-Product
Although steam heating is a primary
function of the plant, another function
is the production of electricity as a by-
product. Four turbine generators supply
much of the electrical power for the
campus. They produce 1250, 4000, 600
and 2500 kilowatts. These turbines
serve as reducing valves in that the pres-
sure of the steam entering is reduced to a
satisfactory level for building heating
while at the same time the generators
produce electrical power.
During the winter there is at times an
excess of power generated which is sold
to the Detroit Edison Company. The
university generators do not produce
enough power during the spring, summer
and fall. Hence, the necessary extra power
is purchased from the Detroit Edison
Company.
The superintendent of operations and
maintenance for the plant department is
Mr. E. C. Pardon. The plant's chief engi-
neer is Mr. R. W. Hodges.

behind-the-lines rescue of downed pilots
or surrounded troops, transportation of
staff officers and rapid evacuation of
wounded from the front lines.
Although the convertiplane will not
displace the helicopter entirely, its much
better speed and range performance, to-
gether with improved ability for evasive
action, will dictate its use whenever dis-
tance and time is critical.
An ultimate major use for the converti-
plane will be in the transport field, both
civil and military. In the civil transport
field, the convertiplane will supplement
the helicopter by providing rapid down-
town-to downtown inter-city service over
medium distance.
Bell, long a leader in the commercial
helicopter field, and a pioneer in super-
sonic fixed-wing flight, is utilizing its
extensive backlog of research and de-
velopment in these fields in its converti-
plane program.
U. of M. Contributions to Rocket Flight
University of Michigan engineers have
made contributions to the science of
rocket flight that are expected to be of
value in the establishment of an earth-
circling satellite in 1957-58.
Although not directly engaged in
preparations for launching the satellite,
Engineering Research Institute personnel
feel they already have added to man's
knowledge of several phases of rocketry.
The Upper Atmosphere Research
Group of the Electrical Engineering De-
partment, for example, was the first un-
iversity group in the nation to be em-
ployed by the Air Force to gather data
on high altitude conditions.
Under the supervision of N. W. Spen-
cer, ERI research engineer, this group has
equipped with instruments and fired a
dozen rockets since 1946 in order to
develop primarily electronic techniques,
learn the air pressure and temperature
as high as 60 miles above the earth.
It takes a year to design, build and
fit into a rocket the instruments that de-
termine these properties from the rush
of air past the rocket's pointed nose.
A similar group, associated with the
Aeronautical Engineering Department,
has been sending rockets aloft that eject
metal spheres or ballons at the top of
their climb. By tracking the falling ob-
jects by radar, or by recording the radio
signals from them, U-M engineers can
calculate the density of the atmosphere
at various heights.
Besides adding to the fund of knowl-
edge about the earth's atmosphere, these
"lower altitude" flights have provided
valuable experience and have taught en-
gineers techniques that can be applied in
the establishment of a satellite 250 miles
above the earth, Spencer points out.
"We have learned to fly rockets with
some confidence," he reports. "This is
essential, for rocket equipment must
work reliably, since human attention is
not feasible during its information-gath-
ering flight."
The two U-M groups plan to fire be-
tween 30 and 40 rockets for the Air
Force during 1957-58, the International
Geophysical Year. Most of these will be
eight-foot Deacon rockets propelled by
booster units from antiaircraft missiles;
the rest will be 25-foot Acrobee rockets.
In the ERI's Rocket Propulsion Labora-
tory at Willow Run, engineers have been
looking for improved methods of ignit-
ing propellants in rocket engines, and for
better ways of controlling the perform-
ance of rocket engines during flight. The
performance of various propellant combi-
nations is also being studied.
Structural testing of high-speed air-
craft and missiles under elevated temper-
atures has been conducted in still another
ERI project.
This is a vital area, for a rocket speed-
ing through the air at thousands of miles
an hour can be heated red-hot by fric-
tion.
At the Aircraft Propulsion Laboratory
at Willow Run, basic studies of com-
bustion fluid flow, detonation waves,
fuel spray efficiency and the effect of
radioactivity on fuel combustion have
been carried out.
Information resulting from these stud-
ies could be of value to the scientists
planning to launch the space satellitt
during the International Geophysical
Year.
Surface Roughness Quickly Checked
with New-Type Hand Comparator
A completely new approach to the
problem of judging surface roughness of
mass-produced parts was announced by
the Bausch &amp; Lomb Optical Co., Roches-
ter, N. Y.
The new principle is embodied in an
inexpensive surface comparator which
permits metal surfaces to be compared
with a selected standard for roughness
under 10-power magnification.
The comparator will speed up the work
of set-up and production men and qual-
ity control inspectors who must constantly
make judgments regarding surface rough-
ness.
A pocket-sized, hand-held instrument,
the surface comparator operates on a
unique optical principle which greatly
emphasizes surface irregularities. It il-
luminates both the known standard and
the piece under study. When looking in-
to the 10-power eyepiece, the user sees a
circular image, one half of which is the
standard, the other half, the sample being
checked. A comparison can thus be quick-
ly made using commercial roughness
standard strips, or samples of satisfactory-
work.
According to B &amp; L research, the in-
strument fills a long standing need for a
handy, inexpensive tool to examine sur-
faces after milling, turning, grinding,
planing, buffing, polishing, plating,
painting, and lacquering.
Previously, production workers usual-
ly judged a metal surface for roughness
by testing it with a fingernail, and then
testing a standard block or roughness
strip for comparison.
Quality control inspectors and labora-
tory technicians also use the fingernail
technique, but may in addition use such
devices as profilometers which sell for
thousands of dollars. The B &amp; L instru-
ment is expected to aid these technicians
by filling the gap between the two meth-
ods of judging surface roughness. Prod-
ucts can now be tested right on the
production line.

Sees Through Storms
In our time, Man has won round after round in a contest
against the elements that started thousands of years ago.
The most recent scientific victory is something new in
Radar—an electronic "Weather Eye" developed by RCA.
In airplanes, this supersensitive instrument peers miles
ahead. It gives advance warning of weather disturbances. The
signals on its radar screen point the way to a safe course
around storm areas, or even through them.
The leadership in electronic research that made the
"Weather Eye" possible is inherent in all RCA products and

How to tackle heavy
thrust loads in a 400-ton
traveling block
Fleet angles set up a thrust problem on this oil rig
traveling block. Engineers solved it by mounting the
sheaves on Timken5 tapered roller bearings. They
keep the sheaves in positive alignment regardless of
the fleet angle or line load, give the 400-ton capacity
block maximum stability.
Timken bearings are designed to roll true, and
precision-made to live up to their design. As a result,
sheaves rotate freely and easily, even with a full
weight of drill string, reducing line slippage and wear.
o
The taper in TIMKEN® bearings
lets them take radial and
thrust loads in any combination
Timken bearings are tapered to take thrust loads as well as
radial loads, or any combination. And Timken bearings can
handle heavy loads because (1) they have full line contact
between rollers and races. And (2) the rollers and races have
shock-resistant cores under hard, wear-resistant surfaces.

ducted in the laboratory where certain
types of alloys are maintained at constant
high temperatures and are subjected at
regular intervals to much higher tem-
peratures for short periods.
The metals under observation are of
the type used for turbine blades in jet
engines. The test simulates the conditions
which would be present when a jet en-
gine is in operation. The blades would be
maintained at a certain temperature in
regular flight but at certain times, the
pilot would accelerate and cause the in-
ternal temperature to increase rapidly; in
normal practice, it is not the operational
elevated temperature of the engine which
is detrimental to the life of the compon-
ents, but rather the sharp rises and drops
in temperature.
Using the data obtained, new alloys
are being developed which resist the
detrimental effects of such conditions.
These are the so-called "super alloys."
They have a nickel-cobalt base and pos-
sess extremely desirable creep-resisting
properties. Other alloys based on chrom-
ium and molybdenum oxide are also in
the developmental stage but are imprac-
tical because of their brittleness at room
temperature.
Another possibility is a material called
"cermet." It is composed of powdered
molybdenum and ceramic materials
which have been mixed and sintered at
high temperature. It also presents a prob-
lem in fabrication—it is extremely diffi-
cult to manufacture parts made of this
material which have constant properties.
In the laboratories, creep tests are con-
ducted upon metals to discover their high
temperature properties. In the East En-
gineering building, the same tests are
enacted on hot metals as well as
on metals of normal temperatures. A
test specimen is heated to a desired
temperature, removed from the furnace,
and tested for impact resistance on the
Charpy tester. Tensile tests are also con-
ducted, but the specimen remains in the
furnace during the process. Hardness
tests at elevated temperatures and metallo-
graphic examination are carried out ac-
cording to ASTM standards. To deter-
mine a metal's resistance to oxidation, a
specimen is heated to a certain tempera-
ture for a desired time. The degree of
oxidation which has taken place is meas-
ured by the number of grams lost per
inch of surface area.
The tests conducted are both intensive
and extensive. Because of this, a great
amount of knowledge is being added to
the data we now have concerning the
properties of metals at high temperatures.
This enables science to develop metals
which are capable of withstanding creep
and other detrimental effects of high
temperature operation.
Once the materials are developed, a
major portion of the problems which
presently retard the achievement of higher
velocities of aircraft will be removed.

Let's try, as a starter this month, to
figure out the probability that a stick,
being broken into three chance pieces,
may be arranged in the form of a tri-
angle. Realize that if a 12" stick is broken
into two pieces 2" long and an 8" piece,
no triangle can be made. The answers to
this mental gymnastic and to following
ones will be found in the next issue of
the Technic.
In a different vein is the problem of
multiplying by excesses. Multiply 104 x
106. Do it longhand instead of by slip-
stick. Now look at the product closely
and try to deduce, with just plain in-
genuity, a rule that you could have used
to multiply the numbers mentally. Test
your rule on other numbers between 100
and 110. Give it a try; never can tell
when it might come in handy.
Coming up in the world, or down, de-
pending on the point of view: We've got
an escalator problem that may have oc-
curred to you at some time or other:
how can you count the number of steps
visible at a given time, when the steps
are continually moving? Supposing you
and a fellow genius tackle the problem
as follows: Your friend walks up, taking
one step to your every two, and when
he gets to the top he finds he has taken
21 steps, while you have taken 28 to get
to the top, walking twice as fast. You
conclude that there are a certain number
of steps visible at a given instant in time,
but what is that number and how did you
arrive at it?
So much for that, now let's cover an-
other area: Specifically, we'd like you to
try to find the area between two circles
of radius ten inches each, with centers
ten inches apart.
A fellow we met the other day posed
the next problem in these words: "When
I was young, a freshman, in fact, I made
a shrewd business deal. I bought half a
gross of marbles for as many pennies as I
got marbles for eight cents. When I went
into industry that year I made six hun-
dred and three dollars. The Bureau of
Internal Revenue checked my return and
they want to know how much I paid for
the marbles. Can you tell them without
losing all of yours?"
Once upon a time there lived a Michi-
gan engineer who had made enough
money to make a will. (For the sake of
the problem, we shall not take time to
ponder that wonder.) Being an engineer,
he stated in his will that if he died and
left only a daughter, his wife would re-
ceive three-fourths of his estate. But if
he should leave a son, the wife, whose
name was Ilga, would receive only one-
fourth of the estate. So, sure enough, he
went and really fouled things up. He
died and left both a son and a daughter.
This situation so unnerved his lawyer,
Igor by name, that he left town on the
obvious pretense that the cost of living
in that town was quite high . . . and the
poor old widow, Ilga, was left penniless.
Is there anyone in the vast researches
of that town who can come to Ilga's
rescue and tell how much of the old
guy's estate she should receive?
One of last month's teasers involved
an addition represented by letters in the
following configuration; it was specified
that no two letters stood for the same

The solution is:

Another problem involved a man's pay-
ing the links of a 23-link chain in lieu of
rent for 24 days until he received the
necessary money. He was to cut only two
links to give the landlord only one link
per day . . . this is how it was done: The
man cut the fourth and eleventh links,
leaving sections of 3, 6, and 12 links,
plus the two single, cut links. On day
1. he gave a single link
2. gave second single
3. took back singles and gave 3-link
4. gave single
5. gave second single
6. took back all previously given and
gave 6-link
7. gave single
8. gave second single
9. took back singles and gave 3-link
10. gave single
11. gave second single
12. took back all given and gave 12-

11. through 23: essentially repeat 1
through 11, leaving 12 link in pos-
session
24. stalled off landlord until money ar-
rived, then bought back chair, plus
paying 24th day's rent.

Aboard Navy vessels, it's not un-
usual to meet piping temperatures as
high as 900° F., at pressures of 1000

course, is subject to drastic thermal
expansion, and absolutely demands
support that is both constant and

easily rip loose from its moorings, and
"walk" all over the place.

Oil FLUID ENERGY FOR
AN ENERGETIC PEOPLE
Crude oil spouting from the earth is the
fabulous fountain that has put this nation
on wheels and wings. Oil has made mil-
lions of homes and buildings more com-
fortable and, through the "magic" of
petrochemistry, hundreds of new products
have been created, ranging from fabrics
to formaldehyde.
Modern, advanced refining methods are
producing the most powerful gasolines
ever offered, to fuel America's 47 million
cars. The airlines' planes and the rail-
roads' diesels depend on the same petro-
leum for their tremendous power.
The rocketing importance of oil to so
many major segments of the nation's
economy makes finding new reserves to
be tapped an unending, expensive job.
And it is to the industry's credit that it
is reinvesting—year after year—so much
of its own money in exploration, research
and expansion—-determined to be ready
to meet a market for petroleum fuels
that is expected to climb to an awesome
$32 billion annually by 1975.
The petroleum industry always has de-
pended on steam for power, heating and
processing. And steam's versatility was
most recently demonstrated when several
major refineries contracted with B&amp;W to
build special Carbon Monoxide boilers to
convert waste gases into useful power.
B&amp;W, working cooperatively with the oil
companies, is providing efficient, econom-
ical steam throughout the petroleum in-
dustry—as it does throughout all U. S.
industry. The Babcock &amp; Wilcox Com-

New Bail Out System for Jets
An improved method of emergency-
escape for pilots bailing out of super-
sonic aircraft was disclosed by the Air
Force.
The principal element of the system,
which has been employed only in re-
search aircraft, is a downward ejection
seat which is stabilized in an upright po-
sition by two fins. Should the pilot be
forced to abandon his plane at a high
altitude, he rides the seat down quickly
to 15,000 feet. There he is separated
from the seat automatically and lowered
to the ground by conventional parachute.
If the bail-out becomes necessary at a
lower altitude, the pilot and chute are
cleared from the seat within three sec-
onds. In any case, the entire automatic
sequence is triggered with two quick
movements of one hand.
The new escape system was engineered
by Douglas Aircraft company in cooper-
ation with the U. S. Air Force Research
and Development Command as part of
the Douglas X-3 high-speed research
project.

Four top scientists discuss creative thinking before fellow research men and
engineers at a Joint Technical Conference held in French Lick, Indiana, by
Standard Oil and its affiliates. Panel members were, left to right above, E. L.
d'Ouville, G. W. Ritter, P. C. White, and T. A. Abbott. Moderator was
Joseph K. Roberts, left inset, general manager of research and development
for the parent company.
The Very Idea!
Petroleum scientists and engineers have
a habit of coming up with the very idea to
solve a problem at the very moment it is
needed. They have created hundreds of
new products and have improved others,
putting the petroleum industry in the van
of American industrial progress.
The contributions of Standard Oil scien-
tists, working in extensive laboratories
and with the finest equipment, have been
outstanding. To give them even greater
opportunity to exchange and develop ideas,
Standard Oil uses the most modern tech-
niques for stimulating creative thinking.
Groups of our scientists now meet in
informal and relaxed creative sessions.
Through "brainstorming" and similar de-
vices, they contribute fresh, new thinking
to the solution of specific problems. These
men are creative by nature, and they
"pop" even more ideas, faster, at sessions
where one idea stimulates another.
In such an atmosphere of progress,
young scientists and engineers find great
opportunities to make positive contribu-
tions and build interesting careers.

Verily I say unto you, marry not an engineer, for the engineer is a strange
being and possessed of many devils.
Yea, he speaketh eternally in parables which he calleth formulae.
And he wieldeth a big stick which he calleth a slide rule and he hath but one
Bible—a handbook.
He talketh always of stresses and strains and without end of thermodynamics.
He showeth always a serious aspect and seemeth not to know how to smile.
And he picketh his seat in the car by the springs thereof and not by the damsel
beside him.
Neither doth he know a waterfall except by its power, nor a damsel, except
by her specific heat.
Always he carrieth his books with him and he entertaineth his maiden with
steam tables.
Verily though she expecteth chocolates when he calleth, she opens the pack-
age to disclose samples of iron ore.
Yet, though he holdeth his damsel's hand but only to measure the friction, and
he kisses only to test the viscosity.
For in his eyes shineth a faraway look which is neither love nor longing, but
a vain attempt to recall a formula.
There is but one key dear to his heart, and that is a Tau Beta Pi key, and one
love letter for which he yearneth, a "C",
And when to his damself he writeth of love and signeth with x's, mistake not
these symbols for kisses, but for unknown quantities.
When a boy he pulleth a girl's hair to test the elasticity, but as a man he dis-
covers different devices,
For he would count the vibrations of her heart beat and he reckoneth her
strength of materials.
For he seeketh ever to pursue the scientific investigation, even his heart flutter-
ings he counteth as a vision of beauty and he inscribeth his passion in a

And his marriage is a simultaneous equation, involving two unknowns and

TEST FLY JET FIGHTERS
While only one test pilot-engineer flies a new supersonic jet fighter,
dozens of Grumman engineers go along via pre-flight planning,
in-flight telemeter recording, and post-flight analysis of oscillo-
graph records. By telemetering, the engineers on the ground receive
data on control forces, structural loads, temperatures, vibrations
and accelerations imposed on the airplane by predetermined
maneuvers. Later, the oscillograph records are read by electronic
machines which reduce the data for detailed analysis.

OF LOWER COSTS
THE engineer who knows how
to cut production costs com-
mands the attention of manufac-
turers everywhere.
Cutting production costs starts
with knowing how to use the least
costly materials that will both han-
dle the loads and can be fabricated
economically.
The best material for most prod-
ucts is ... steel. Here is why:
1. Steel is 2 to 3 times
stronger than gray iron.
2. Steel is 2V2 times as rigid
as iron.
3. Steel costs a third as much
per pound.
Utilizing the superior properties
of steel to best advantage, material
costs can be cut as much as 85%.
This means that with today's fast,
efficient welding methods, most
machine designs can be fabricated
with overall reductions in cost aver-
aging up to 50%. Here is an example
of how it is done. n

complete escape system includes a pro-
tective helmet, redesigned clothing and
improvement of such standard equipment
as the oxygen supply.
Downward ejection was designed into
the X-3 for two reasons. First, the force
required to shoot an ejection seat up
and over the X-3's tail at advanced
speeds is beyond human endurance.
Secondly, an upward opening canopy
would have created a serious drag re-
sistance to the airplane's flight.
Foremost among the numerous prob-
lems that faced designers was that of
stabilizing the seat during bailout, since
a seat ordinarily tumbles violently in the
high-speed air stream.
Urgency of maintaining stability under
such conditions was established by Lt.
Col. John Stapp in high-speed sled tests
which showed the human body can with-
stand forces encountered in supersonic
bailouts if the body is seated upright in
relation to the direction of the force.
The problem was complicated by the
need to stabilize the seat through the
turbulence of the three speed ranges:
supersonic, transonic and subsonic.
Data on the aerodynamic characteris-
tics of such an oddly-shaped body as an
airplane seat were lacking when the X-3
project was begun. Thorough wind tunnel
tests on a miniature seat model provided
the information which led to equipping
the seat with fins.
Then a series of advanced tests utiliz-
ing a full-sized seat were conducted on
the High Speed Track at Edwards Air
Force Base, Calif., and in wind tunnels
at Wright Air Development Center, Ohio.
Subsequently, the seat was ejected re-
peatedly from the bomb bay of a jet
bomber traveling at high speeds and alti-
tudes in order to examine its stability in
free fall during a lengthy descent. These
trials also demonstrated that the seat's
automatic separation equipment would
function properly. The tests showed that
the fins maintained the ejection seat in
a safe flight position, without tumbling,
until it reached a low enough speed and
altitude for the pilot to continue earth-
ward in a normal parachute descent. Peak
force from wind drag was reduced by
54
increasing the weight of the seat sub-
stantially by installing on it such equip-
ment as the ejection rails, the airplane's
complete oxygen system and various
other components normally attached to
the airframe. Douglas engineers said
transferring weight to the seat resulted
in a net weight savings to the airplane.
Other high speed tests revealed that
air ramming into the front of a standard
helmet built up pressures which would
blow it from the pilot's head, leaving
him without protection from wind blasts
and without oxygen, since the oxygen
mask is attached to the helmet.
Douglas engineers partially solved
these problems by incorporating into a
conventional helmet a protective visor
and reinforcing guard for the oxygen
mask. Since it was impracticable to seal
the headgear completely against super-
sonic ram pressures, air ducts were sculp-
tured into the helmet to provide escape
paths for inside air pressures and create
a partial vacuum to help hold the helmet
in place.
The standard G-suit was modified by
stitching a reinforcing nylon vest to the
suit and relocating the zipper from the
chest to the back. A nylon collar was
added to connect the helmet and suit
and protect the pilot's neck. Wind-blast
tests at simulated supersonic speeds
failed to damage the equipment. The
seat structure is designed to protect the
pilot's arms and legs during ejection.
Building the oxygen supply into the
ejection seat system eliminated need for a
bailout bottle, since the escaping pilot
can use the airplane's regular oxygen out-
put until he has reached a point in his
descent safe enough for normal breathing.
A special oxygen quick disconnect fitting,
using permanent magnets to assure a
firm seal, was devised when wind tunnel
tests showed the standard fitting could
not carry the high air loads.
The Douglas X-3 is still undergoing
high-speed flight tests at Edwards Air
Force Base under direction of the Na-
tional Advisory Committee for Aeronau-
tics (NACA). Performance of the air-
plane is classified.

Engineers Earning More
Engineers and other professional em-
ployees in American industry now are
earning about 4.5 per cent more than
they earned last year, according to a
survey of compensation paid to adminis-
trative and technical personnel just com-
pleted by the Executive Compensation
Service of the American Management
Association. The majority of the compan-
ies surveyed reported granting salary in-
creases to individuals in this group dur-
ing the past year.
The study, the second on this subject
that the 21,000-member management
educational association has conducted,
covered 20 engineering and professional
job categories in 19 industries. It is part
of a continuing series to report salary
ranges for specific "exempt" (from com-
pulsory overtime penalty pay provisions
of the Fair Labor Standards Act) jobs
in business and industry. Most of the
positions studied arc technical or highly
specialized in nature; typical arc those
of development chemist, project engin-
eer (electrical or mechanical), industrial
engineer, and sales engineer.
Considering the great demand for and
short supply of professional personnel,
the range of salaries reported in the
survey is surprisingly narrow, the A.M.A.
report says. The average beginning en-
gineer receives about $4,500 a year.
Median pay for industrial engineering
positions is approximately $6,000 annu-
ally; for chemical positions, $6,500; for
electrical and mechanical engineering,
$7,000.
The pay level for these 20 administra-
tive and technical positions is just about
the same as that of production foremen,
as indicated by a recent A.M.A. survey of
foreman compensation. Like foremen and
like "middle management" personnel
(those between first-line supervision and
the policy-making level), individuals in
similar professional and administrative
positions tend to receive similar salaries
regardless of geographic location. In
contrast to management compensation,
which usually is higher in larger com-
panies, their salaries do not vary sig-
nificantly among industries or with com-
pany size, the study indicates.
Technical and professional employees
are less likely to receive bonuses in ad-
dition to their salaries than are foremen
and middle management personnel. On-
ly a fifth of the individuals included in
the new survey received bonuses this year,
as compared to a fourth of the foremen
and two fifths of the middle management
executives.
Like the other reports of the A.M.A.'s
Executive Compensation Service, the ad-
ministrative and technical positions sur-
veys are designed to help companies
evaluate their compensation policies in
the light of current practice in other
firms. These confidential studies are
available on a subscription basis to bus-
iness and industrial executives who have
responsibility for administration of the
compensation involved.
Westinghouse Research Scientists Make
'Perfect' Iron
Pure and perfect slivers of iron, having
breaking strengths approaching a million
pounds per square inch—far greater than
any other known metal—have been pro-
duced on an unprecendented scale by
scientists at the Westinghouse Research
Laboratories. The slivers of iron, or
"whiskers" as they are called, are each
a pure iron crystal so perfect that
no defects can be detected in its
structure. The crystals are as much as
two inches long and a thousandth of an
inch thick. Previous attempts to produce
these "whiskers" have given crystals
which could be observed only with the
aid of a microscope.
"Perfect iron is another forward step
in our attempt to gain a broader under-
standing of the fundamental properties
of metals," Dr. Hutcheson said. "Because
of their strength, hardness, ductility and
other useful properties, metals have al-
ways been the backbone of civilization.
But it is interesting to note that all these
desirable properties of metals as we know
and use them today, are actually deter-
mined not by the metal itself but by the
impurities and imperfections it may con-
tain."
Very little is known about metals that
are completely free of impurities and
imperfections simply because they are
never found in nature and, until recently,
could not be prepared in the laboratory.
Theoretically, however, it is known
that such metals should exhibit fantastic
properties which could make them ex-
tremely valuable to man. For example,
pure iron has an ultimate tensile strength
of more than a million pounds per square
inch. This is at least 10 times the strength
of ordinary iron which has been hard
drawn into wire and at least three times
the strength of the kind of steel used in
making piano wire.
"Pure and perfect iron will not emerge
tomorrow as a brand new construction
material," Dr. Hutcheson added, "but
at last it has been prepared on a scale
large enough that we can make a real-
istic study of it and begin to find ways
to utilize the unusual properties it pos-
sesses."
Dr. Hutcheson said that preparation
of the perfect iron and testing of its
mechanical properties was done by Drs.
A. W. Cochardt, H. W. Wiedersich, and
R. L. Eisner of the metallurgy depart-
ment of the Westinghouse Research Lab-
oratories. The iron is the result of the
perfection of a new "whisker growing''
technique which was originated in the
Laboratories about two years ago by Dr.
John C. Kelly, physical chemist in the
magnetics and solid state physics depart-
ment.
Dr. Cochardt reported that the perfect
iron "whiskers" were made in this man-
ner:
Highly purified iron chloride, a com-
mon salt' of iron, is heated in an atmos-
phere of hydrogen gas inside a special
furnace at a temperature of about 1100
degrees Fahrenheit. Through rigid control
of the temperature and flow of hyrogen,
the chlorine atoms in the iron chloride
are allowed to unite chemically with the
hyrogen at a certain precise rate. This
leaves unattached atoms of iron, which
'migrate' slowly toward each other and
deposit one upon another in perfect
arrangement. Thus, billions of iron atoms
'grow' without any observable defects
into a single perfect crystal of pure iron,
exactly square in cross section, and often
attaining a length of two inches.

Most engineers remember Engineering Mechanics as a few basic courses in statics, dynamics,
strength of materials and fluid mechanics. But Engineering Mechanics does not end with these
conventional courses. Students who major in this field take advanced work in mathematics, elas-
ticity, plasticity, dynamics, vibrations, fluid dynamics and therodynamics. Such courses stress the
fundamental approach to these subjects, and provide the training necessary to solve the complex
problems which exist in modern technology.
The welded steel wheel shown above presents a typical research problem in mechanics. Defec-
tive welds cannot be detected visually nor can destructive tests be run on each part, so the
decay rate of mutual vibrations of the wheel rim is used as a measure of weld quality. Instru-
ments are arranged so that this decay rate can be observed visually on the oscilloscope as well as
recorded for a permanent record. As a result of this and similar work it is possible to develop
automatic equipment for the testing of welds and the rejecting of defective work.
The Engineering Mechanics graduate is often intimately associated with the most modern devel-
opments in engineering and science and, like other engineers, many have found their way into
management and ownership. The College of Engineering pioneered in offering a degree program
in Engineering Mechanics and has educated many men, including numerous recognized leaders, in
this field.

ing the faces exposed only as high as a
man can reach, scaffolding was erected.
Workmen dressed the faces while stand-
ing on light scaffolding extending some
30 feet high and were able to check
their accuracy with plumb lines.
Muscles and Brains
Dressing faces, hauling blocks, and
quarrying stone required manpower in
wholesale quantities. Lacking the ma-
chinery of today, and even some of the
simple devices such as the pulley, the
Egyptian engineers relied on the muscles
of their workers to accomplish their con-
struction feats. Despite the use of over-
seers and the lash, the builders of the
pyramids were not slaves. "The world's
first W.P.A. project" is how Michigan's
Mr. Peterson terms the pyramid construc-
tion, for slavery was not yet a part of
Egyptian society. During the summer
months when the Nile overflowed its
bed, farming and other activities ceased.
The bulk of the construction work took
place during this period, absorbing vast
numbers of unemployed workers. At
least one hundred thousand laborers were
employed on the Great Pyramid.
It was the efficient organization of their
manpower which probably enabled the
Egyptians to achieve their spectacular
success. The workforce was elaborately
divided into numerous groups and gangs,
each one being assigned a specific job
and quota. This thoroughness of plan-
ning was necessary, for time became an
important factor in the construction of
the Pyramids. Each Pharaoh faced the
possibility of dying before his monument
was ready and this only added to the
urgency of the engineers' task which al-
ready included a multitude of problems,
ranging from designing the structure it-
self, to the attainment and transportation
of materials, to providing for the worker's
needs and even interruptions for religious
ceremonies. The pyramids give silent evi-
dence that these problems were met.

With U. S. Steel, my future holds interest,

From his graduation in 1948 with a
B.S. degree in Mechanical Engineer-
ing, until November of that year,
Edward Stolic worked as an operat-

United States Steel. Following his
discharge from the Army in 1950,
he returned to work at U.S. Steel. In
just 18 months, Mr. Stolic reached a

Lubrication.
By mid-year 1953. Mr. Stolic was

HI-LITES OF JANUARY
In the last half-century the automobile has changed from a
luxury item to practically a necessity. As a result of this change
the auto industry has grown to be one of the biggest in the coun-
try. Its ups and downs affect directly a great many people and
indirectly the welfare of the country.
In 1955 production reached an all-time high of 8,000,000 cars.
One new car for every 20 people.
These are the reasons why we decided to devote almost the
entire issue to automotive articles.
Tracing the evolution of auto styling from a poor downtrod
minor feature to its present high state, Abe Goll tells you why,
what and what's to come on page eleven.
After beating the horsepower race to death the auto industry
needed a new gimmick to play up in its ads. Coupled with a new
public awareness of the grim toll of auto accidents this led to
the innovation of many safety gadgets for '56. Helen Reeves who
worked at Chrysler last summer puts the spotlight on auto safety
for you on page fourteen. Some nice pictures of the major safety
features accompany this article.
An evaluation of aluminum engines on page thirty gives you
the economic and engineering possibilities of replacing the iron
and steel under your hood by aluminum. Following this is an
explanation of a fuel injection method which bids to replace the
carburetor.
It's really happening! West Engine Annex is coming down to
be replaced by a new library building. On page sixteen Phil
Irvan tells the story of the building that has been condemned
as a fire hazard for many years.
That's it guys—hope you enjoy it.
P.S.—Jokes are really good this time.

systems for interceptors are first

which the equipment is readily
accessible to systems test engineers
One interesting problem recently confront-
ing Hughes engineers was that of evaluating
the requirements imposed upon the pilot of
a high-speed one-man interceptor. This arose
in the development of a new integrated elec-
tronic system to control several phases of an
all-weather interceptor's flight. Because of
the great importance of providing the pilot
with the optimum design and arrangement
of displays and controls, it became necessary
to determine accurately the pilot's work load
during flight, and the human factors that
affect his ability to carry out his task.
The solution was to install a complete
mock-up of the actual interceptor cockpit in
a large T-29 aircraft in which a breadboard
model of the system was being tested. From
this cockpit a test pilot can simultaneously
operate the electronic system and fly the
T-29, performing all the functions of an in-
terceptor pilot. Systems test engineers and
psychologists analyze his problems and his
performance, and adapt the cockpit design
to the natural abilities of the human pilot.
The result will be a much better "fit" of pilot
and electronic system prior to final flight
testing in the tactical interceptor.
interceptor electronic system uses unique approach.
Required are engineers with a basic interest
in the system concept, who have the ability
to develop new evaluation techniques and
conduct highly controlled tests. They should
be able to resolve complex circuitry prob-
lems, and have sufficient resourcefulness and
follow-through to carry a difficult program
to its ultimate goal.

BODY STYLING
In little more than half a century the
automobile has had its birth and painful
adolescence. It has grown with great
stride. The effect of this growth is
unparalleled by any of man's inventions.
For centuries, people were forced to live
by rivers, lakes or seas. Later railroads
allowed somewhat greater flexibility. But
it was the automobile which for the first
time gave people almost complete free-
dom in personal transportation.
The motor car of today, when pictured
beside the gasoline buggy of 1900, re-
veals an amazing metamorphosis. Aside
from the fact that each has four
wheels, an engine, and a seat, there
is no resemblance between the two. Yet,
the latter obviously could not have been
possible without the former. Strangely
enough, the major evolutionary styling
process changes between the times of
these vehicles have been few in number.
Manufacturers of the early gasoline
carriages were not greatly concerned with
the external design or style of the vehicle.
They worried only about its ability to get
the driver and his passengers from one
place to another under its own power.
Thus, the carriage body sufficed.
When it was thoroughly established
that vehicles could be successfully power-
ed by gasoline, electricity or steam, a
change in thinking followed. Manufac-
turers began to look around, to analyze
their competition, and to seek ways to
surpass their competitors. The element of
style, heretofore practically ignored, be-
gan to emerge as a potential sales factor.
From 1910 to 1930, the manufacturers
main concern was with the mechani-
cal innovations and improvements. How-
ever, styling was becoming a factor of im-
portance. During this era the classic prin-
ciples of proportion, decorum, and sym-
metry were regarded as the cardinal vir-
tues of motor car styling. We refer to it
as "classic" because classicism, whether
it be in art, music, literature or motor
cars, has always meant the strict obser-
vance of rules. This period was charac-
terized by styling based upon classical
lines and the recognizable influence of
free enterprise in sales and showmanship.
Following this period, styling began to
assume an even greater importance. There
was a definite shift in emphasis from lines
to surfaces and highlights. This era in
automotive art marked the first serious
venture of the stylist into the realm of
the sculptor. By executing ideas in three
dimensions, it was easier to solve the
complicated problems of styling. At the
same time, the stylist had a greater op-
portunity to exercise his abilities and tal-
ents. Due, in some degree, to those new
found tools automotive forms assumed a

new look. Body surfaces began to dis-
appear. Pseudo-streamlining gradually be-
gan to replace symmetry—a trend which
was to attain further significance in the
years to follow.
The Influence of American Public
The lack of printed material would
seem to indicate that little has been done
to evaluate the public's influence on auto-
mobile styling. Actually, public influence
plays a vital part in the design of auto-
mobiles. Because the colors and materials
used to give today's car its glamorous,
rich-looking interior, are definitely sub-
ject to changes in fashion, most automo-
bile manufacturers pay close attention to
the goings-on in the world of art and
fashion. For example, the interior fabrics
and colors for one line of 1956 automo-
biles were selected by a panel of the na-
tion's foremost fashion experts to insure
its having the highest-style interiors ob-
tainable.
Other indications of the influence of
public opinion are reflected in the "idea"
or "dream" cars. These cars serve a
worthwhile purpose aside from giving
public indication of the future's possi-
bilities. They test the public's reaction to
the ideas which the automobile stylists are
considering for the future. If the reac-
tions are good, features of the "dream"
cars are incorporated in future models.
If public reaction is adverse, the ideas
are forgotten or shelved until the public
is ready to accept them.
Many features now considered essen-
tial on automobiles have come into being
because of the clamor of car buyers. For
example, flashing turn signals, wrap-
around windshields, more powerful head-
lights, bumper guards, larger windows
(especially rear windows), hardtop
coupes and sedans, and rear-opening
doors are all items which, once introduc-
ed, caught on rapidly because people
wanted them.
Even the dimensions of current cars are
the result of public demand. Like a tele-
vision screen, an automobile is subject
to being rated for quality by its size
alone, and therefore American cars are
being built as large as possible so that
everyone can enjoy the prestige of own-
ing a big automobile. To accentuate this
look of longness and lowness, horizontal
lines are made bold and prominent, and
the car body often takes on a crisp squar-
ish appearance.
In general, automobile body design is
influenced by public opinion but this in-
fluence is usually not felt until after the
design is on the road. Working in an
evolutionary rather than revolutionary
pattern, the ace manufacturer designs a
car which he thinks incorporates enough
of the familiar and enough of the new to
make a salable product. If he guesses
wrong, he takes another approach the fol-
lowing year. In other words, public opin-
ion is not a deciding factor in the design
of a new car body, except where conven-
ience, safety, passenger room, trunk
space, etc., are concerned. It is public re-
action to a design already established
which plays the important role in deter-
mining the shape of cars to come. All
manufacturers listen most carefully to
what people say about the models they
have just introduced, for in the highly
competitive automobile industry, the
manufacturer who steps too far from the
path of public acceptance places himself
in a dangerous position.
Thus the automobile designer is ob-
ligated to keep posted on what the pub-
lic wants in an automobile. Yet to invite
the public to participate in designing the
car would be sheer folly for so many
conflicting opinions and wishes would be
voiced that the end result would lack
unity of design.
Early American Influence Upon
Present-Day Styling
Because public taste is conservative and
does not welcome radical changes in auto-
mobile design, it is important for us to
consider the influence of early American
vehicle styling.
Like present day automobiles, the early
stagecoach builders took great care to
analyze the uses and abuses to which their
vehicles were subjected. These vehicles
were used to transport a number of
people and their baggage over the rough
pathways which spanned a vast and grow-
ing nation. As a result, the stagecoaches
were sturdily built with special attention
to passenger comfort and large luggage
facility. Abundant motive power was also
a prime factor in the early horse-drawn
vehicles. The long distance to be covered,
the difficult terrain, and the necessity of
accomplishing the voyage within the
shortest possible time compelled the use
of several horses in order to supply a
maximum power, beyond that which was
really needed to pull the heavy coaches.
When American cars first appeared on
the scene, much of the difficult traveling
conditions experienced by the stage-
coaches still prevailed and adequate mo-
tive power was still needed. While, since
those early days tremendous improve-
ments of our highway system have been
made, the long distances to be traveled
still require plenty of sturdy, lasting
power. Therefore, over a period of many
years, the American motorist has come
to expect comparatively large and roomy
vehicles as well as more than adequate-
power to pull them. This, in turn, has had
a very definite influence on American
motoring vehicles, insofar as chassis de-
sign and body styling are concerned. At
any rate, this influence resulted in auto-
motive vehicles whose concept is definitely
different from that of European vehicles.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Most British and Continental designs
have these basic style factors in common:
a long hood, narrow over-all width, low
silhouette, limited luggage capacity, two
or four passenger seating, and large diam-
eter wheels. Any one of these factors
has a noticeable influence on design.
The European car owner desires ex-
treme readability above comfort and
mere transportation. He considers his
motor car a very personal possession.
Frequently, he enters it in contests such
as hill climbs, rallies, concours d' ele-
gance, or other competitions. These events
provide some owners with an opportunity
to display their expensive "playthings."
For others, the contests furnish a sincere
avocation and an outlet for their sportive
spirit.
The European usually drives over
winding roads and so must have the ut-
most in cornering characteristics in order
to enjoy his "sport" in comparative
safety. To achieve this the European de-
signer places the driver and passenger
well back in the chassis to distribute more
weight to the rear wheels and thus ob-
tain the traction required for this type of
driving. Many like to work on their own
engines, particularly the sports car own-
ers. For these reasons, they demand the
improved accessibility which the longer
hood provides. From a more abstract
point of view, the longer hood is a po-
tent psychological factor in that it denotes
power and strong directional quality. To
the European, the fiercely long snouted
Grand Prix racing car is the epitome of
basic proportion.
The low silhouette, narrow tread and
body width, and smaller passenger capac-
ity are typical earmarks of the European
luxury car. Generally speaking, the Euro-
pean who owns a high performance car
does not take his family motoring the
same way we do, so his actual need for a
six-passenger car is considerably lessened.
The very low silhouette is a natural de-
velopment of smaller length and width
dimensions and the desire for good pro-
portions in style. The owner is not too
concerned about cramped seating because
he rarely travels a great distance. He
usually prefers maneuverability, and the
economic and streamline advantage of
low frontal area to roominess and boule-
vard riding comfort.
For many of these same reasons, a very
small luggage capacity is characteristic of
most automobiles abroad. Shorter dis-
tances and fewer passengers make a large
rear deck unnecessary. This factor has a
great bearing on over all proportions and
shapes of the European car.
automotive history, the past and current
trends in styling and how they are in-
fluenced by the public, it is appropriate to
examine the styling of tomorrow's car.
While this last question could well be an
embarrassing one, I will not try to look
into a crystal ball, because it seems a
little cloudy today. Therefore I will do
the next best thing—examine some facts.
Let us look at what happened when
Studebaker came out with a daring new
concept of automobiles both in 1947 and
r
i
One of the strongest characteristics of
the British and Continental motor cars is
the large diameter wheel. Here again we
find evidence of racing car influence as the
large wheel lends a considerable flavor of
sporting character. An impression of sta-
bility and tremendous power and per-
formance are created by the proportion-
ately large wheels of the Grand Prix
racing car. The European designer tries
to create a feeling of these same qualities
by the same methods. By way of contrast
to the average American, the average
European is much more interested in rac-
ing and racing cars. Such enthusiasm is
certain to influence styling trends to a
great extent.
While British and European car styling
is generally dictated by the preceding
consideration, it must be remembered
that, even though these influences create
common factors in these various schools
of design, esthetic tastes are what bring
about the sharp contrasts between these
different groups. Each nation stamps its
personality upon its product, whether it
be architecture, music, literature, the
pictorial arts, or motor cars.
Mos European designers have tried
to hold fast to some of the classic pre-
cepts of automobile art and have man-
aged, despite the fast moving changes of
modern times, to retain some of the dis-
tinctive character of their predecessors.
Some will say that, in this effort, Euro-
pean stylists are simply stubborn, while
others may say that they are older and
wiser. Perhaps they have learned that
novelty is not usually a basic requirement
for beauty.
What of the Car of Tomorrow?
After this review of early American
again in 1953- At first the public was
slightly startled, but shortly afterwards it
caught fire. It caused much controversy
among automobile manufacturers and the
buying public. That, of course, was good;
it started a new way of thinking. The
other manufacturers profited immensely
from this experiment. Soon afterwards
they all came out with similar designs
and the public loved it. That proves that
the car enthusiasts are not as conservative
as many have thought.
At present the automobile body is
almost at a point where much change is
impossible. Oh yes, changes such as bet-
ter and safer equipment are sure to be
made, and maybe even completely trans-
parent passenger compartments will come
into being. But what then? After all
comes the limits and the public will want
something new. That time is not so very
far away.
No, this will not be the end of design-
ing. Wider automobiles with engines in
the rear and passenger cabins in the front
for better visibility will appear. Many
people at present are afraid to sit in the
front of the car because there is no hood
to protect them in case of accidents, but
new safety devices and highway laws will
change their outlook. When this happens
the automobile will be very different and
very beautiful.
It will take much courage and initia-
tive on the part of the first manufacturer
to introduce such a new and different
concept, but it will be a success. More
power to the first!
Many thanks to Mr. V. M. Exner, Mr.
E. D. Vosburgh, both of the Chrysler
Corporation, and to the Society of Auto-
motive Engineers for their reference ma-
terial.

By HELEN H. REEVES, M.E/58
In a nearly saturated market, Detroit's
automotive companies are frantically seek-
ing new sales promotion tactics to sell
cars. The most effective method Detroit
has for finding out what John Q. Public
wants in terms of a car is consumer re-
search, carried on extensively by the in-
dustry and through agencies. The latest
results of these reports show that the
prospective car buyer is frightened by
the highway mortality rate. As a result, a
new era has evolved in sales promotion,
with "new" safety being played up. In-
cidentally, safety developments are now
hot competitors to horsepower ratings in
the perpetual inter-industry race of car
makers to outdo one another.
Actually this business of automotive-
safety is nothing new—the industry has
been developing safety features for the
past five decades. The windshield, which
was introduced in 1903, was perhaps the
first safety feature. Although relatively
unpublicized, safety engineering and its
very positive developmental progress has
been a main concern of the industry since
the automobile was given birth. But since
the general public has taken an interest
in a safer car, safety developments are
being speeded up. Many of the recent
innovations are merely 'teasers' that look
good on advertising layouts and conse-
quently impress the guy that believes
the old advertising pitch for a fool-
proof car. Other, not so extraneous, de-
velopments are definitely new and posi-
tive concepts in automotive safety.
After much inter-industry squabbling
over public reaction to being embraced
by the binding seat belt, it is finally in
production by most companies and is
offered as optional equipment. Plans are
now being developed for an extension
of the seat belt idea in the criss-cross
shoulder harness. This will prove an even
"safer" body retainer in an accident.
The push-button transmission selector,
offered by two of Detroit's auto makers,
has many safety advantages since there
is no mechanical linkage protruding.
Touch" pressure (estimated to be three
to five pounds) will activate any push-
button and reduces possibility of the
wrong push button being activated.
Packard's electrical push button shift-
ing is especially interesting, tying the
system in with the ignition circuit. For
example, a driver who activates the

The author demonstrates the use of a safety belt.
"Park" push button when leaving his car
parked on a hill or on an inclined drive-
way need not worry that a child may
come along and accidentally unlock the
"Park" lock. When the driver removes
the ignition key, the selector is automati-
cally locked in "Park" where it cannot
be disengaged without again opening the
ignition circuit with the ignition key. At
speeds over five miles per hour, only the
push buttons marked "Drive", "High",
or "Low" can be activated as driving sit-
uations require. The others are automati-
cally locked out to prevent any possibility
of damage to the transmission through
selection of the wrong drive.
The safety door latch (although it is
not a new engineering conception—
safety type door locks were utilized as far
back as 1940) has emerged as the most
outstanding device designed solely for
safety purposes. Some of the late '55 cars
had such latches and most '56 cars offer
them as standard equipment. All com-
panies have given these latches exhaus-
tive tests and they have proven foolproof
in almost every crash situation.
Ford's safety-dished steering wheel is
well-positioned for the average driver,
and unlike Kaiser's earlier version, there
is enough diameter to make you feel
that you have hold of something when
cornering. This "dished" effect lowers
the top of the steering post several in-
ches below the rim of the wheel. The
wheel spokes "give" away from the
driver to cushion the shock of a sudden
stop. This prevents the driver's chest from
hitting the steering column.
Other safety features include foam-
rubber, leather, or plastic padded dash-
board panels offered in all makes of cars
as optional equipment, with the exception
of higher priced models which include
them as standard equipment. Padded sun
visors, shatterproof rear-view mirrors and
stronger front-seat connections are also
offered as optional equipment. There are
also acoustical headlinings which create
better sound conditions within the car
and minimize driver distraction under al!
kinds of motoring conditions; improved
ventilation systems that bring in more
and cleaner air; adjustable front seats that
offer the best driving position for drivers
of various heights; and more convenient
location of car controls on the dashboard.
Better headlights are found on the '56
cars. They project the low beams farther
down the highway, adding as much as
eighty feet to the driver's vision. Some
models even have luggage compartment
trouble lights with signal wires that un-
reel for seventeen feet.
In 1953, General Motors introduced
the panoramic windshield. Since that
time, car visibility has been vastly im-
proved in all models. The windshield has
been broadened, slanted and curved to
give fuller "all-round the car" vision.
Safety glass is used for all windows, giv-
ing the utmost in clear vision and reduc-
ing eye-fatigue to a minimum. Tinted
glass reduces daytime glare and is an ad-
vantage even in winter when the ground
is white with snow.
The 1956 car has a lower center of
gravity and more equal weight distribu-
tion for greater stability, power steering
that has improved recovery handling
characteristics over previous models, tube-
less tires that have a greater resistance

OF THE
ANNEX
By PHIL IRVAN, M.E/59
One of the oldest buildings on campus,
the Engineering Annex, is finally going to
be torn down. In its place, a new under-
graduate library is to be erected next
spring.
Built in 1885, the building has been
used for over forty years to house the
Automotive Engineering classes and labs.
The building has been condemned
many times as a "fire trap"; in 1937, the
building was damaged by two fires in the
labs—one costing over $5,000.
In 1934 the students in the law quad
objected to noises coming from motors
being constantly run, saying that it in-
terfered with their studies and sleep.
This provided good practice for the bud-
ding lawyers as they won their case-—the
motors were shut off.
In spite of these handicaps and many
more, important improvements in auto-
motive design have developed within the
walls of the Annex.
The building will be torn down this
winter after the new automotive lab is
built on north campus. This new building
was started in the fall of 1954 and is
expected to be completed by next Janu-
ary. It will cost $1,850,000. Professor
Jay Bolt of the Mechanical Engineering
department said that the labs will be de-
voted, for the most part, to the power
plants of vehicles, although some work
will be done on body design.
The new under-graduate library's plans
are expected to be completed December
1, and the actual ground-breaking will
begin in mid-February, after the Annex
is torn down. S3,680,000 have been ap-

Dick Abraham of Bell Telephone Laboratories, here experimenting with closing the loop on a transistor feedback amplifier.
'I'm working with top names and top talent"
That's one of Richard P. Abraham's comments
about his career with Bell Telephone Laboratories
in Murray Hill, N. J. "In 1954, after I'd received
my M.S. from Stanford," Dick continues, "I was
interviewed by a number of companies. Of these
I liked the Bell Labs interview best—the interviewer
knew what he was talking about, and the Labs
seemed a high-caliber place.
"The Labs have a professional atmosphere, and
I'm really impressed by my working associates.
As for my work, I've been on rotating assignments
—working with transistor networks and their meas-
urement techniques, studying magnetic drum cir-
cuitry, and doing classified work on Nike. This
experience is tremendous.
'In addition to the job, I attend Lab-conducted
classes on a graduate level several times a week.
Besides that, the Labs are helping me get a Ph.D. at
Columbia by giving me time off to get to late after-
noon classes. That's the kind of co-operation you
really appreciate from your company.
"What are important to me are the opportuni-
ties offered by the job and the work itself. My wife
and I own a house near Murray Hill, and we've
found a lot of friends through the Labs. All in all,
I think I'm in the right kind of place."
Dick Abraham is typical of the many young men
who are finding their careers in the Bell System.
Similar career opportunities exist in the Bell
Telephone Companies, Western Electric and
Sandia Corporation. Your placement officer has

to blowouts, and high engine compression
ratios for increased power, giving better
passing ability in normal speed ranges
where power can be an important
contribution to safe driving. Brakes have
been engineered to increase smoothness
and control, reducing "grabbing" and
"locking" tendencies. Chrysler offers an
independent propeller shaft-mounted
hand brake that is declared the only
"true" emergency brake on the market—
it is always there to stop the car even if
the service brakes are useless or have
faded. All of these "internal" improve-
ments, while not directly connected with
safety, create better driving ease and com-
fort with less effort required by the
driver. We feel that these developments
are more important in automotive safety
than many of the safety gadgets that arc-
being promoted.
Packard's torsion bar suspension pre-
vents swaying or fish-tailing on corners
or in negotiating sharp curves. It gives
greater handling stability at high speed
ranges, and absorbs shocks and vibrations
before they can get to the chassis.
The non-slip differential, that Packard
has engineered for its '56 cars, is in-
valuable from the safety standpoint. The
non-slip differential has better traction;
it senses a slipping rear wheel and con-
centrates power to the other rear wheel.
On ice or mud, when one wheel is unable
to get a grip, the differential will trans-
mit tractive power to the wheel on the
firmer surface. This transmission of
power will be as much as eighty per cent
of that necessary to propel the car. It
eliminates "wheel hopping" on sharp
curves or corners—which is contrasted to
the conventional differential that has
some jump sideways when cornering. The
non-slip differential reduces wear on dif-
ferential parts and bearings, eliminates
tire slippage and tire wear, and mini-
mizes the possibility of the differential
"snapping" when a car has to be maneu-
vered out of a "stuck" condition.
Many of these safety features we've
mentioned are standard equipment in the
'56 models. Optional extras are relatively
inexpensive. For example; a "package'
of two front-seat belts and pads for the
instrument panel and sun visors are sol J
for Ford cars—priced at twenty-five dol-
lars.
Another phase of this business of safe-
ty is product testing—a behind the scenes
requirement that the public has little
knowledge of. The importance of testing
each new safety feature cannot be over-
emphasized. At the various proving
grounds test cars are constantly undergo-
ing roll and impact tests to determine
structural strength. These tests are at-
tempts to study and improve design struc-
ture of the modern car and to increase
dissipation of impact energy between
the point of impact and the passenger
compartment. Life-like dummies are used
in many of these tests to observe probable
human reaction in different accident sit-
uations. The dummmies have weights,
dimensions, joints, and skin patterned
after the average man. They can be ad-
justed to be tense or relaxed under crash

impact. Electronic devices record the
force and time intervals of blows re-
ceived in a staged accident. High speed
cameras are also employed to record the
change of position of the dummies.
Test engineers can tell us in exacting
terms the time interval and the amount
of force which the human body is sub-
jected to in an accident. For instance,
safety engineers report that a person with
both hands against the instrument panel
and feet braced against the floorboard
would have to withstand a force of more
than one-half ton on each arm and leg
to prevent being hurled forward in an
impact occurring at thirty miles an hour.
Uncountable test miles are covered in
these tests that are probing into the prob-
lem of trying to increase passenger
safety.
Exhaustive tests are also run on com-
ponent parts of the automobile that in-
fluence handling and control. Headlights,
steering mechanisms, suspension systems,
brakes, doorlocks, and many others are
included in these tests. This testing is
both extensive and severe on any phase
of the car that is to be tested. It is
carried on in the laboratory and at the
proving grounds. Without this testing
an unproven safety device could easily
be a totally unsafe addition to the mod-
ern car.
Preventitive safety has become a big
concern in the automotive industry. Ford
and Chrysler have each given grants of
two hundred thousand dollars to Cornell
University Medical College for the ex-
pansion of the school's auto crash in-
jury research program. General Motors
gives financial support to dealers who
loan cars to high school driver training
classes, as surveys show that driver train-
ing graduates have a lower accident rate.
During 1954-55 General Motors supplied
over half of the country's driver training
cars.
The Automotive Safety Foundation,
functioning in an advisory and fact find-
ing capacity, has proven beneficial to
traffic safety throughout the country. The
auto companies are cooperating with
highway officials throughout the country
for improved highway design, construc-
tion of which will affect future design
of cars. Automotive safety engineers are
now having conferences with crash high-
way specialists, traffic safety officers, mo-
tor vehicle administrators, inter-industry
organizors, and other public officials to
compare testing devices, procedures, and
results.
In response to John Q. Public's re-
quest, the whole industry is concentrating
efforts to produce a safer, saner car. And
automotive safety has become a many-
sided field, including design, engineering,
testing, and prevention techniques. A new
inter-industry cooperation has resulted,
for competing car makers find that they
need each other to probe into this diffi-
cult business of safety.
And so, if public interest continues to
be concerned with staying alive, Detroit's
powerful internal combustion machine
will attempt to lose its reputation as a
killer—providing, of course, that the car
driver also engineers himself to safety.

ALUMINUM ENGINES
By JOHN R. LONG and DONALD H. PERRY
Development Division Alcoa
Research continues to bring cast alum-
inum engine parts for automotive applica-
tions closer to economic and engineering
reality. Interest in aluminum engines has
been quickened by the trends toward in-
creasing both the horsepower-displace-
ment ratio and the horsepower-weight
ratio.
The interest of American industry in
the use of aluminum engines is a natural
one. In this direction, aluminum com-
panies in this country have developed the
sandwich-brazing method for fabricating
cast aluminum engine blocks and cylin-
der heads and are continuing to improve
it for eventual use in production. Since
it is desirable for aluminum parts to
compete cost-wise with ferrous metals,
production methods are continuously be-
ing improved. At the same time, how-
ever, extensive testing is being done on
performance and design of aluminum
engines. One interesting test project in
the use of aluminum has been carried
out on the Italian Lancia V-6, Model
B-10 engine.
The Lancia Aluminum Engine
This engine combines extensive use of
aluminum with an interesting V-6 de-
sign. Forty-seven per cent of the engine's
total weight is aluminum.
The Lancia B-10 was chosen for test
purposes after a survey had been made
of European automobiles in which light
metals are more extensively used for
production models. A Lancia Aurelia
sedan was obtained which was powered
by the B-10 engine, and the engine was
given extensive road and dynamometer
testing. Component parts were carefully
inspected.
The Model B-10 engine includes many
unique features in the 60 deg Vee, six
cylinder, overhead valve design. The en-
gine has a 2.75 in. bore, 2.99 in. stroke,
and 106.9 cu. in. piston displacement.
The compression ratio was measured as
6.82 to 1 and dynamometer testing indi-
cated a maximum horsepower rating of
59.9 at 4400 rpm (corrected to 29.92 in.
mercury at 60 F dry air.) A maximum
torque of 86.5 lb. ft. was attained at
2800 rpm and a minimum specific fuel
consumption of 0.515 lb. per hp-hr was
obtained at 2400 rpm.
The four main bearing crankshaft has
six crankpins, each spaced at 60 deg. in a
clockwise spiral from front to rear.
The firing order of 1-4-3-6-5-2, with
the 60 deg. between cylinder banks, re-
sults in equally spaced firing every 120
deg. of crank rotation. It might be add-
ed that the engine was found to be ex-
ceptionally smooth throughout the speed
range, even with a full load application
at a speed of 800 rpm.
Although most of the oil seals are
rather conventional, the crankshaft seal
is a novel. A reverse helix on the crank-
shaft pulley is fitted to a 0.010 in. to
0.015 in. clearance to the cast aluminum
timing gear cover which functions as a
reverse pump to make the seal. In a like
manner, at the rear, a helical gear makes
a seal with an adapter plate which is bolt-
ed to the crankcase. No leakage was
noted in 11,409 miles of road operation.
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


The crankcase is a permanent mold
aluminum alloy casting and incorporates
a wet cylinder line design. A careful in-
vestigation of the crankcase revealed no
use of dry-sand cores. Instead, the design
has been so ingeniously developed that
iron molds and loose metal cores are used
throughout. The cast iron liners are
flanged to seat on faces machined in
jackets which completely enclose them,
leaving about 3/16 in. water space
around the sleeve. These are fed by
tapered round water galleries on the out-
side of each bank. The liners are sealed
with rubber O-rings at the lower end,
and the water circulates up through pas-
sages in the flange into the cylinder
head. After one and a half years of
operation, there was no evidence of cor-
rosion in the block or heads. City water
and standard antifreeze had been used
throughout this period.
The performance of the main bearings
in the aluminum alloy crankcase and
bearing caps were of particular interest in
view of the possibility of reduced oil
clearances at low temperatures. The bear-
ing shells are 0.200 in. thick with a
bronze back and lead babbitt facing
(about 0.025 in.). Oil clearance was
measured as 0.0013 in. at the time the
engine was torn down. Engine breakaway
torques were obtained at temperatures of
—8° and 80° F. with values of 40
lb.-ft. and 17.3 lb.-ft., respectively, being
measured. An increase of this magnitude
in breakaway torque certainly shows no
tendency for the bearings to freeze up
because of contraction of the block.
The cylinder heads are aluminum alloy
sand castings incorporating iys in. ex-
haust valves and 1 7/32 in. intake valves
at 26 deg. from the center line of the
cylinder, in hemispherical combustion
chambers. The wide spacing of the cyl-
inders in each bank allows the valves to
lie in the longitudinal central planes of
the banks. The 14mm spark plugs arc-
located at an angle of 27 deg. to the long-
itudinal central planes. The rocker arm
covers, which are aluminum alloy perman-
ent mold castings of approximately \/4 in.
thickness, serve to reduce valve train
noises.
The push rods are fabricated from
aluminum tube with pressed-in flanged
ends of steel. These push rods were an
aid in maintaining proper valve lash with
changes in the engine temperature. The
tappets run directly in the aluminum
block. The camshaft is supported by three-
split bushings and has a solid flanged
bushing at the front. All these bushings
are made of an aluminum alloy. The
split bushings, held by retainer rings for

movable for cleaning of the sump and

Aluminum Parts
The economical permanent mold proc-
ess of casting aluminum alloys has been
put to extensive use in the fabrication of
parts for the Lancia Model B-10 engine.
Of the aluminum used in the engine, 60
percent of the total weight is made up of
full permanent mold castings, while the
remainder is in the form of sheet, sand
castings, and semi-permanent mold cast-
ings. This extensive use of permanent
mold castings, in what might be consider-
ed rather limited production, should
arouse some interest in this country in
the manufacture of aluminum engine
parts other than pistons. Such items as
the crankcase, oil pan, rocker box covers,
timing gear cover, distributor housing,
etc. lend themselves well to the use of
the permanent mold process of casting
aluminum alloys, as has been shown by
the Italians in manufacturing these parts
for the Lancia.
Although this discussion deals primar-
ily with the Lancia B-10 engine, mention
should be made of the Lancia Aurelia
sedan in which the engine was received.
Such features as the full independent
wheel suspension, unit body and frame
construction, the clutch, transmission, and

final drive location and design, as well as
the extensive use of aluminum, are uni-
que and interesting. The drive unit in-
cludes clutch, transmission, differential
and brake. Of the 2390 lb. total car
weight, approximately 420 lb. has been
estimated to consist of aluminum alloys.
Aluminum has been utilized in the fab-
rication of such parts as the clutch, trans-
mission, and differential housings, drive
shaft couplings, shock absorber bodies,
brake shoes and cylinders. The body and
trim include such aluminum parts as the
doors, trunk lid, hood, gravel deflectors,
pumpers, door handles and window
molding.
Significance of Aluminum
What does such liberal use of alumi-
num mean to the automobile manufac-
turer? In general, for each pound of
aluminum used in a design, there is a
total weight reduction of one pound. A
309 lb. engine, which is 47 per cent
aluminum by weight, would therefore
weigh approximately 454 lbs. if manu-
factured entirely of ferrous materials.
This would result in an increase in the
specific engine weight of from 5.16 lb.
per hp. to 7.5 lbs. per hp., all of which
would be sprung weight over the front
wheels.
Designs tailored for the more econom-
ical permanent mold or die casting proc-
esses may make cast aluminum automo-
bile parts less costly and reduce weight.

GEORGE M. LINCOLN, JR. expects to receive his B.S. in met-

is active in sports, vice president of his junior class, and a partici-
pant in many other campus activities. He's starting his employ-
ment investigations early, for he feels that the selection of an
employer is one of the most important decisions in a man's career.
Charlie Smith answers:
They have an almost endless variety of interesting
problems to face, George. As a student of metallurgy
you know that about two-thirds of all known chemical
elements are metals. Many of them are revealing valu-
able new applications, when highly purified on a com-
mercial scale. Du Pont is greatly interested in several
metallic and semi-metallic elements.
My own experience at Du Pont ranges from work
on titanium pigments, to metallic titanium production,
and to the ultra-pure silicon used in transistors. You
can appreciate some of our metallurgical problems when
I point out that impurities in transistor silicon have to
be below one part in 100 million. That's equivalent to
one pound of impurities distributed through a train of
ore cars twenty miles long!
Some of our metallurgists carry out fundamental
research on new metals, and, in the development stage,
they frequently operate pilot plants for producing them.
Other metallurgists study problems relating to engi-
neering materials used in construction, carry out re-
search on intergranular corrosion, or investigate fatigue
relationships encountered in dynamic, high-pressure
operations.
You'll find many challenging opportunities in every
phase of metallurgy at Du Pont, George.

U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service Employs
Television in Underwater Research
An underwater application of closed-
circuit television is enabling the U. S.
Fish and Wildlife Service to observe
and test the performance of experimental
fishery methods and equipment under
actual oceanic conditions.
The Service's underwater TV experi-
ments were initiated with "Operation
Fisheye", conducted recently in the Gulf
Stream east of Florida. A standard RCA
ITV closed-circuit television system pro-
vided remote observations of experimen-
tal fishery gear towed at depths of more
than 60 feet. The gear was illuminated
only by natural sunlight, and the views
produced on the TV monitor were suffi-
ciently clear and sharp for photographing
by both still and motion picture cameras.
In underwater operations, the RCA
ITV camera -is housed within a water-
tight steel cylinder, which is mounted in
a submersible free-flooded, ball type "div-
ing bell." Atop the "diving bell", and
connected to it by a gear train and yoke
assembly, is a watertight electrically
driven power unit, which permits remote
control of the TV camera's scan—a com-
plete circle and 90 degrees in elevation.
What the TV camera "sees" is projected
over a flexible multiconductor cable to a
remote control TV monitor aboard the
research vessel.
The advantage of TV over earlier
methods is that the TV camera can con-
ceivably be operated at greater depths and
for longer periods of time than could a
diver, and without the risk entained by
the use of a diver.
The values of underwater TV are wide-
spread. Investigations of marine biology,
bottom formations and bottom-type fishes,
water temperatures, current flows, and
other oceanic data can be made where-
such investigations have hardly been pos-
sible. Besides gear research in the com-
mercial fisheries, delineation and harvest-
ing of clam, oyster, and scallop beds will
be very much simplified.

tudes and temperatures.

Predicted by engineers to be the next
automotive advance in engine design is
the replacement of carburetors by fuel in-
jection systems. In eliminating the rela-
tively inefficient and uneconomical car-
buretor, fuel injection offers numerous
attractions to the automotive industry.
For the chemist fuel injection means
the use of lower octane fuel because of
cooler and equalized charges of fuel. For
the stylist the absence of bulky carbure-
tors and aircleaners permits lower hood
lines and improved forward visibility.
From the performance viewpoint, fuel
injection increases engine horsepower by
increasing the volumetric efficiency and
by eliminating the necessity of heating the
intake air to provide proper fuel vapori-
zation. Increased torque becomes avail-
able at the lower speeds, as the fuel is
instantly delivered directly to the engine
cylinder or intake port, giving momen-
tary fuel enrichment. Additionally, auto-
mobile owners gain the highly sought
benefits of increased fuel economy by
better cylinder to cylinder fuel distribu-
tion and reduced consumption during
acceleration and deceleration periods.
(Fig- I)-
How Fuel Injection Works
These advantages of fuel injection sys-
tems result from their basic design fea-
tures. Fuel injection is built around the
need for accurate metering and consis-
tent atomization of the gasoline through-
out the fuel loads demanded by the speed
ranges of modern high speed engines.
The main components of this system
includes a constant pressure pump, a
metering distributor, injectors, and a mix-
ture control.
Fuel injection systems are generally
oriented in the following way: A pres-
sure pump supplies fuel at a constant
pressure to the injector for each cylinder.
The metering distributor, placed between
the pressure pump and the injectors,
connects the correct nozzle to the fuel
pressure supply at the proper time per-
mitting only a metered volume of gas
to pass. These fuel injectors, which arc
outlets for the gasoline into the manifold
or cylinder, serve as stop-valves during
the injection periods to give a good
atomization of the fuel. The right fuel-
air ratio is maintained through the mix-
ture control with tubing connecting the
various units according to the type of in-
stallation used.
Of particular importance is the meter-
ing distributor. By providing equal fuel
loads to each cylinder, smoother and
more efficient engine performance is as-
sured. Of the various types of distribu-
tors, the single-plunger intake-metering
injector pump has gained the most favor
as it eliminates excessive wear through
the use of a relatively small number of
parts. Moreover the principal advantage
of this system is found in the simple con-
trol for metering the fuel. A direct link-
age can be used between the injection
pump and the air throttle, with the in-
jection pump calibrated to meter the
amount of fuel required to provide the
desired fuel-air ratio for each position of
the throttle butterfly.
The injection pump, which is suitabk-
for both manifold and cylinder injection,
consists of three principal parts: fuel
supply pump, fuel metering valve, and
pumping and distributing plunger. This
injection system was selected because past
experience indicates that a supply pump
prevents vapor lock. It also provides in-
take metering and a mechanical linkage
between the injection pump and air
throttle which in turn provides good fuel-
air mixtures over a range of speed-load

conditions. A single distributing plunger
obtains equal distribution of fuel to all
cylinders and simplifies design.
Finally the fuel injectors atomize the
equal volumes of pressurized fuel by
spraying it through the nozzle. They
have a one piece housing with a small
poppet type valve in the injection end de-
signed to give an effective spray.
Recent Developments
The fuel injection system developed by
the Petroleum Chemical Department of
du Pont represents one plausible design.
(Fig. 2). For their research, du Pont in-
stalled an American Bosch high pres-
sure system on a 1954, V-8 Lincoln pas-
senger car.
The test results revealed some amaz-
ing facts. The pretroleum laboratory
found that their injection engine gave
six to seven per cent more horsepower
than the stock engine. With both sys-
tems set at the same power spark timing,
fuel injection required lower octane rat-
ing. The deviation of the air-fuel ratio
between cylinders was not more than plus
or minus two and one half at all speed
ranges. The deviation of the fuel loads
was not more than plus or minus two
per cent. As of yet, tests have not been
run on the economical aspects.
However, the fuel injection system of
the Cummins diesel engines show eco-
nomical characteristics that could be pro-
vided for in gasoline engines. Essentially,
the design consists of the same main
parts. In the 1950 Indianapolis Speed-
way 500-mile race, the Cummins' car,
using a fuel injection system, showed
good performance. Due to the low rate
of fuel consumption, refueling stops were
unnecessary. In the 1930 Indianapolis
Speedway race, a Cummins' car completed
the full course non-stop, at a speed of
85 m.p.h.

Let's start this cold month with a
couple of warm-up quickies:
What two numbers, composed only of
ones, will give the same result by addi-
tion or multiplication?
Or, if you're a wordy one with an
aversion to numbers, try listing a word
containing a double vowel for each of the
five vowels. Hard, isn't it?
We tossed this one in especially for
the South Quad high-volume-music
"broadcasters": A phonograph record has
a diameter of 12 inches. The recording
leaves an ounter margin of one inch, and
has an unused center of 4 inches. How
far does the needle travel when the rec-
ord is played?
Can't avoid that math, apparently:
Here's a joker who's positive he's revo-
lutionized arithmetic; what's wrong with
his proof that 1 = 2?
1-3 = 4-6
1-3 + 9/4 = 4-6 + 9/4
\l - 3/2)2 = (2 - 3/2)2
1- 3/2 = 2 -3/2
1 = 2
"All work and no play . . .," so let's
try a game of cards: Shuffle an ordinary
bridge deck and turn the cards face up
in pairs. If both cards are black, you get
them, but if they are red, I get them. In
the event that one is black and the other
red, they are discarded and belong to
neither of us.
You will be charged one dollar for the
privilege of playing the game, but when
the deck is depleted I will pay you three
dollars for every card more than I which
you have. If you have less than I, you
are not charged.
What is the probability that you will
come out of this game financially ahead?
Here are some answers to December's
teasers:
First off, how often is it likely that a
stick, broken twice at random, will there-
after be able to be formed into a tri-
angle? The stick is first broken into two
pieces. Of this there is no doubt and the
probability is unity, or one in one. One
of the pieces must now be broken in two
to yield the required three pieces. It is
assumed that the original fracture was
not at the center, so that there resulted
two unequal lengths. If the shorter of the
two is now broken, a triangle is impos-
sible to form since the two pieces are
now greater than the third. Therefore, it
can be seen that the only way in which
a triangle is possible is if the longer of
the original two is broken. The probabil-
ity that the longer will be chosen for
the second break is one in two or one-
half. The answer is therefore one half.
Multiplying by excesses: The title of
this very handy shortcut is somewhat of
a giveaway. An excess is the number
minus 10 to the appropriate power. In
the example of 104 times 106, the ex-
cesses are 4 and 6. Here is the magic
(easily verified by algebra) rule for mul-
tiplying by excesses:
To either factor add the other excess,
and annex the product of the excesses,
In the example already forwarded, 1CK
is added to 6 (or 194 to 4) and th.
product of 6 and 4 is annexed. The resui:
is therefore 1,024 by inspection. If the
two numbers had been 115 and 107, the
same procedure would be followed, re-
membering that the answer must hav;
only five digits. Two interesting spec^
cases are: 1) squaring, where excess---
are equal, and 2) multiplying number;
less than the power of ten, so that the
excesses bear a negative algebraic sign.
The escalator problem can be approach-
in several ways. Let's assume you did it
by considering the escalator's projection
on the lower floor (the x-projection)
and assumed that the treads were each
unit length long. The situation results in
a moving belt, horizontal, with a length
equal the number of steps. We now havc-
a simplified d = rt problem.
Let b = rate of belt in units/sec.
m = your rate in units/sec.
w = the rate of your genius pal
in units per second
d = length in units
The time necessary for your transit wj&gt;
d/(b + m) units, and you walked 28
units. We can therefore say that
bd
(b + m)
and, for your pal, that
bd/(b+ w) + 21 = d.
Also, m = 2w.
Although the three equations have four
unknowns, you found to be 42 units
anyway, and that, you further concluded,
meant that the escalator has 42 steps in-
stantly visible.
The area in the overlapping parts of
those two ten-inch-radius circles is 122.84
square inches. The area is the sum of two
equilateral triangles and four segments.
Ilga, the hapless widow, may not be
rich, but both conditions of her husband's
will can be fulfilled, so that the son re-
ceives three units; the daughter then re-
ceives one-third of a unit, and Ilga re-
ceives one thirteenth of the estate.
Lastly, the fellow who was trying to
get you to lose your marbles paid 24
cents for his.

being rooked in our card game, come

Souped Up
A gas generator hardly bigger than a

about 850 jet horsepower, has been de-
veloped by the General Electric Com-
pany's Aircraft Gas Turbine Develop-
ment Department.
Using no moving parts, the gas gen-
erator is designed to convert liquid hydro-
gen peroxide into a high pressure, high
temperature gas stream of free oxygen
and steam. This gas stream, or jet as it is
called, may then be directed against a
turbine wheel and the rotative power thus
generated may be used in the same man-
ner as any turbine-generated power.
Weighing less than 3y2 pounds, and
only about four inches long by three
inches in diameter, the gas generator pro-
duces about 850 jet horsepower in its
designed guided missile application.
Department engineers say jet horse-
power from the same unit has been varied
from as little as 50 to about 1800 by
simply adjusting the incoming liquid
flow rate, and that operating life require-
ments from a few seconds to hours can
be designed into the unit.
Possible industrial applications of the
gas generator include use as a source of
energy for rotating machinery, as a thrust
simulating device for static tests of air-
plane or missile models, or as a quick and
reliable source of steam.

Dr. Ward Kuentxel and Dr. Edmund Field, co-inventors, observe operation of
the new Magne-Dash autoclave in Standard Oil's Whiting research laboratory.
Orders for inventions taken here
Modern research creates a need for brand-
new types of equipment. In petroleum labora-
tories, mixing up some stuff in a beaker usually
isn't the answer. The research pioneer may
have to use high temperatures and high pres-
sures. If he must stir his mixture, he has a
tough job. How can he prevent leakage past
the shaft of the stirrer?
To meet this and other difficult situations,
Standard Oil has set up a "Special Devices
Program". A group of scientists creates the
apparatus needed to solve today's problems.
An example is the Magne-Dash* autoclave.
It has a magnetically operated agitator, and
no external moving parts. Leaks cannot occur.
Research men now use freely the high pres-
sures that lead to new plastics and other new
products.
Like many other inventions made by Stand-
ard Oil scientists to solve our own problems,
the Magne-Dash is licensed for production and
sale by a maker of scientific equipment.
The Special Devices Program is just one of
the creative activities at Standard Oil. Young
scientists find it stimulating to work in such
an atmosphere.

One of the main problems facing
American Bosch, as well as the other

system for original equipment. With the
facts that carburetors are becoming more
complex and expensive and that ample
production quantities would cut costs, the
companies believe that fuel injection on
original equipment is more a reality than
ever before.
Although fuel injection is ready for
production, it will remain solely in a
development stage until manufacturers

lege in 1943 with a B.S. degree in
Metallurgy. After a stint in the Navy,
he returned to college as a metallurgi-
cal research assistant. In 1949 he re-
ceived his M.S. in Metallurgy and
then came to work at the U.S. Steel
Applied Research Laboratory. After
just four and a half years, Mr.
Bauscher had progressed to Division
Chief for Sheet Products Develop-
ment — responsible for the improve-
ment of present sheet steel products
and the development of new and im-
proved types.
Why did Mr. Bauscher choose U.S.
Steel? Because, says he, "U.S. Steel
produces such a great diversity of
products and maintains such a thor-
ough research program on all its prod-
ucts — not only theoretical research,
but also applied research or product
development. The graduate engineer
| \
I
has unusual latitude in selecting the
type of products and the type of re-
search that interest him most. Work is
done not only on steel, but on many
raw materials and by-products as well.
"And," says Mr. Bauscher, "Oppor-
tunities at U.S. Steel are better now
than ever before because of the em-
phasis on product development and
the recent expansion of research
facilities."

ing and rewarding career with U.S.
Steel and feel that you can qualify,

From layout to missile firing, this proj-
ect is a Boeing engineer's responsibility.
His assignment: to design an engine
mount that will isolate from other loads
and measure within V2 of 1% accuracy
the tremendous in-flight thrust of a
guided missile.
The mount, called a thrust gage, must
fit engine and airframe without modi-
fication of them, and must "grow"
equally in all directions during a tem-
perature rise of several hundred degrees
in less than a minute. The object is a
stronger missile engine mount with less
than half the weight of the present one.
This is typical of the challenging and
creative assignments given Boeing en-
gineers. There arc more than 6,000 of
them—mechanical, civil, electrical, aero-
nautical and nuclear engineers, and
mathematicians and physicists. And
more engineers of all kinds are needed.
This engineer is finishing his layout,
with the preliminary mockup before
him. Next, he will supervise draftsmen
and engineering aides in final drawings.
Then he will work closely with other
engineers in production, structural test-
ing, instrumentation and telemetering.
Creating this thrust gage gives him re-
sponsibility, career growth, and a real
sense of professional achievement.
Boeing engineers have career stability
in a soundly growing company that now
employs more than twice as many engi-
neers than at the peak of World War II.
Living is pleasant for them in the pro-
gressive, comfortable-size communities
of Seattle and Wichita.
These men take satisfaction in know-
ing they're on a winning team that has
created such aviation milestones as the
new 707 jet tanker-transport, the giant
B-52, and the Boeing B-47, "backbone"
of Strategic Air Command. There's a
rewarding job awaiting you now at
Boeing in design, research or production.

The story of Michigan's part in building the world's second largest
suspension bridge over the Straits of Mackinac.
By MIKE KRAFT, L.S.A. '59
Floating derricks scoop out
the bottom of Mackinac
Straits through 116 foot
diameter caissons while con-
structing piers for the bridge
swers.
With the cutting of ribbons, sched-
uled for November 1, 1957, the first
travelers will cross the Mackinac Bridge,
gaining the public's initial close look at
the long awaited 100 million dollar struc-
ture. Perhaps most impressive to the
users of the bridge that many people
called impossible to build, will be its
26,444 foot length (five miles, 44 feet),
and the record breaking 8614 foot dis-
tance between anchorages.
Less striking to those crossing the
suspension bridge and viewing the Straits
of Mackinac more than 150 feet below
is the vast amount of preparation and
planning necessary to bridge the Straits.
Part of this preliminary work, from in-
vestigation of the rocks beneath the piers
to calculations of the suspended spans,
has taken place at the University of Mich-
igan.
Proposals to directly connect the Up-
per and Lower Peninsula arose as early as
1884, but it was not until 1920 that the
State of Michigan officially showed any
interest. Then eight years later, when
heavy traffic on the state's ferry service
showed the inadequacy of boat service,
the highway department made its first
study. A favorable report was issued,
with the cost estimated around 30 mil-
lion, but the project was eventually
dropped.
Hopes of the backers were strength-
ened in 1934 when the State Legislature
created the Mackinac Straits Bridge Au-
thority and C. E. Fowler, chief engineer
proposed a plan which included a series
of bridges and causeways starting at Chi-
boygan, 17 miles from the Straits, passing
through Bois Blanc Island, the Round
Islands, touching Mackinac Island and
ending at St. Ignace.
U. of M. Enters Work
A more direct route was proposed the
following year by the late Professor James
Cissel of the University of Michigan's De-
partment of Engineering. Cissel, a long-
time supporter of the project, became
consulting engineer and served as the
Bridge Authority's first secretary. His de-
sign, 51/4 miles long, was one-half steel
bridges and the rest was trestle bridges
and causeway.
During that same period of time, Pro-
fessor Glenn Alt of the Civil Engineer-
ing Department and the late Professor
Jacula, designed a cantilever bridge
and drew plans for three separate pro-
posed routes. Two attempts were made
to obtain loans and grants from the Pub-
lic Works Administration, but the
agency's refusal to provide backing ended
hopes for immediate construction.
Despite the setbacks, the Bridge Au-
thority, conducted further traffic, geo-
logical and ice and water current surveys
in anticipation of eventual construction.
The Michigan Highway Department
again lent its support to the project and
engaged Professor William Housel, Civil
Engineering and specialist in Soil Me-
chanics, who, in 1938 to 1940, super-
vised the coring and investigation of the
bottom of the Straits of Mackinac.
Utilizing these cores in the course of
their own exhaustive investigations, mem-
bers of the University of Michigan's De-
partment of Geology added to the neces-
sary preliminary data. Doctor Kenneth
Landes and Doctor George Ehlers were
contracted in 1943 by the Michigan De-
partment of Conservation to make a de-
tailed study of the geology of the Macki-
nac Straits region. Included in their
report was information on the breccia and

shale formations and the deep rock gorge
which characterize the bottom of the
Strait.
World War II halted any further prog-
ress of the bridge and interest eventually
fell until 1947 when the Legislature
abolished the Mackinac Bridge Authority.
However, three years later, with an eye
on the 20 mile long lines of cars waiting
for ferry service during hunting season,
they recreated the Bridge Authority. In
accordance with the new legislation, the
Dean of Engineering of the University of
Michigan recommended a board of three
consulting engineers to determine the
feasibility of bridging the Straits.
Boosted by a favorable report, the idea
of building a bridge across the Straits of
Mackinac finally left the dream stage. In
1953 the Bridge Authority retained Doc-
tor D. B. Steinman, a member of the
board and one of the world's foremost
suspension bridge experts, to design and
supervise construction of the substruc-
ture, superstructure, and approaches for
a suspension bridge joining Mackinaw
City on the Lower Peninsula with St.
Ignace on the Upper Peninsula.
A deep rock gorge cutting through the
bed of the Mackinac Straits makes a sus-
pension bridge the only feasible design.
The two tower piers, one at each rim
of the glacial gorge, reach a depth of
206 feet below the water for the pier on
the south side, and 201 feet for the north
pier. While the 3800 foot distance be-
tween the tower piers is 400 feet shorter
than the Golden Gate Bridge span, the
8,614 foot measurements between the
huge anchorages set a new record.
Providing support for the bridge are
two approach piers and 32 water-based
piers, among them some of the deepest
and most massive ever built. All but nine
of the piers are founded directly on btc
rock. In the case of these nine, there is
enough overburden above rock to per-
mit the anchoring of the piers by driving
heavy steel H-piles down to bedrock
After being driven down, to depths
ranging up to 174 feet below the surface,
the tops of the piles were embedded in
the concrete foundations of the piers.
Will the Bridge Stand?
Even before the plans for the founda-
tion were drawn, controversy raged about
the ability of the engineers to securely
anchor foundations to the bottom of the
Straits. Professor Landes, who had pre-
pared a study of the geology of the re-
gion, raised doubts that the shale rock
structure on the bottom of the straits
could support the piers. A zone of col-
lapsed breccia formation characterizes the
region over which the bridge is built and
fears were expressed that the weight of
the piers would crush the green shale of
the collapsed zone into mud.
Prompted by the growing controversy,
the highway department made further
studies, taking more test cores and con-
ducting compression tests.
Finally, in 1951 Housel answered the
questions about the ability of the straits
to support the bridge in the report he
submitted to the highway department.
The conclusions are as follows:
"In conclusion, it may be pointed
out that the most positive data from
the loading tests indicates a yield
value of approximately 60 tons per
square foot or about four times the
suggested design capacity. . . . Furth-
ermore, it should be emphasized that
Mike Kraft, '59 L.S.&amp;A., the author of Across the Straits
also recently wrote the Pyramids of Egypt, which appeared
in the December issue. With an eye toward Technical writ-
ing, Mike took pre-engineering courses at Cass Technical High
in Detroit. However, a growing interest in creative writing
lead him to major in English with the purpose of entering the
magazine field. A Tkchnic staff writer since September, Mike
recently joined the Daily Staff and also represents Scott House on
the Inter-House Council.

tlie loading tests were made on shale
selected as the most unfavorable of
the rocks in the foundation and at a
selected location where the shale it-
self appeared to be the weakest
found in the area. . . . Under this
combination of circumstances, the
final answer from the loading tests is
still a demonstration that insofar as
bearing capacity of the foundation is
concerned there can be little ques-
tion of the practicability of the con-
struction of a major bridge across
the Straits of Mackinac."
Professor Housel recently summed it
up by pointing out that although the rock
structure is far from the best, it still is
more than capable of withstanding the
distributed pressures of the bridge.
Further doubts about the piers were
raised by the public's fears that no struc-
ture could withstand the tremendous ice
pressures of the region. As a result, an
extra generous margin of safety was pro-
vided by designing the piers to with-
stand pressure five times as great as ever
recorded. For additional safety against
any possibility of ice damage, steel sheet
pilings, steel caissons and armor plate
shield the concrete piers.
Substructure Construction
Assured that a bridge could be ade-
quately supported and protected against
the elements, Steinman's firm designed
the bridge, and bonds were sold in May,
1954. Merritt, Chapman and Scott, hold-
ers of the $25,735,600 substructure con-
tract, began the foundations.
The contractors built the three deepest
piers, those supporting the towers and
the south cable rest pier, by the caisson
method. Cofferdams are being utilized
for the remaining 29 water based piers.
Of these piers, fifteen use singular
circular cofferdams and 13 use single
rectangular cofferdams. One pier's con-
struction is within two circular sheet
metal cofferdams and another uses double
rectangular cofferdams. These water tight
enclosures are built of interlocking steel
sheet piling and are driven firmly into the
bottom around the space to be occupied
by the pier.
The mammoth anchorage piers, which
anchor the ends of the main cables, meas-
ure 135 feet long by 115 wide. Because
of the enormous size, Merritt, Chapman
&amp; Scott fabricated and installed the cof-
ferdam bracing in three vertical sections
which divers bolted together under water.

HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS
by SHELDON LEVIN, Editor-in-Chief
This issue of the Michigan Technic
is being sent to 1100 high schools
throughout the Midwest. It is hoped that
it will reach many times that many
readers.
There are several reasons for send-
ing this magazine: First, we would
like to emphasize the importance of
engineering and the part it must play in
tomorrow's "brave new world," second,
we would like to build interest in engi-
neering in those graduates contemplating
a career in science or engineering, and
third, we would like to point out the ad-
vantages of obtaining the necessary sci-
entific and engineering education at the
University of Michigan.
In the three articles following we have
considered various aspects of the engi-
neering profession with particular em-
phasis on education in engineering.
Dean George Granger Brown of the
College of Engineering in "The Un-
crowded Profession" tells of the unfilled
demand for engineers, and in keeping
with the University's tradition of for
ward thinking, sketches the development
of new research facilities at North Cam-
pus and three new programs: Science
Engineering, Nuclear Engineering and In-
strumentation Engineering.
"Should I Choose Engineering" by Pro-
fessor John G. Young, Assistant to the
Dean, briefs future freshmen on the engi-
neering profession as a whole and on the
various sorts of tasks engineers perform.
Our jack-of-all-trades, Cecil Mellin.
put together his experiences, thoughts,
and some reading to give you "The Big
School." Pleasant reading awaits you is
humor and wit are sprinkled through a
student's view of a big school, socially,
educationally, and otherwise.
It is impossible for any three articles
to cover anything as complex as the proc-
esses of maturation and education that
take place during one's college years.
This is something that must be experi-
enced to be understood. We feel that an
excellent place to be educated is the
University of Michigan. See if you don't
agree.
While you're being convinced, you
to will probably enjoy reading the regu-
lar articles offered this month. Mike
Kraft, who was last heard from discours-
ing on Egyptian pyramids, jumped many
centuries to a present engineering feat.
In "Across the Straits" he tells of the
long history of the Mackinac Bridge.
Covered in detail are the planning, con-
troversy over whether the rocks will sup-
port the piers, methods of construction,
cost, and progress so far.
"Flight Without Wings" by Ted Fried-
man reviews a new type of wingless air-
craft that have little resemblance to exist-
ing planes.
An ERI project report by Dave
O'Brian, Betsy Palmer's Technic Teasers
and McHigan plagiarism round out the

UNCROWDED PROFESSION
by DEAN GEORGE G. BROWN
During the troubled years that have
followed World War II, a flourishing
American economy has been the bulwark
of the free world.
Perhaps the most dynamic force in this
economic system is technology, an in-
genious industrial science that has made
it possible for a nation with only six per-
cent of the earth"s population to produce
fifty percent of the world's goods.
The life-blood of technology is the
engineers and scientists produced by
this country's educational institutions. The
increasing importance of these men is
borne out by the fact that, since 1890, the
number of engineers employed by indus-
try for each 100,000 workers has jumped
from 344 to 1,500—one engineer for
each 64 employees.
Government and industry recognize the
demand for engineers as one that
stretches into the indefinite future as new
products, new techniques and new indus-
tries are created and as an unprecedented
scale of manufacture, research and de-
velopment continues. Business manage-
ment is now adopting the engineering and
scientific methods in the application of
systems and operational analysis to their
commercial operations, still further wid-
ening the field of engineering activity
The supply of engineers is falling
far short of the demand, however: last
year 40,000 jobs awaited 22,000 grad-
uates. A natural consequence of this
shortage is an increase in the size of sal-
aries offered graduates. This is the present
trend, with starting salaries raised each
year by industrial organizations who re-
quire engineers for their normal opera-
tions, and particularly by those companies
that have defense contracts with the gov-
ernment. The December, 1955 issue of
Fortune magazine points out on page 138
that "the Intercontinental Ballistic Mis-
sile Project is on the verge of becoming
the same sort of crash program that creat-
ed the atom bomb ... at least one com-
pany has received the flat order to spend
whatever is necessary to save a week or
even a day."
Engineering and the physical sciences
are placing greater emphasis upon the
language of mathematics to express the
relationships and to solve the problems
encountered in practice. For this reason,
a minimum familiarity with mathematics
is required as adequate preparation for
the study of engineering at the college
level.
But of equal importance is familiarity
and mastery of the English language, for
this in a large measure determines the
effectiveness of the engineering graduate
as a professional man. Unfortunately
there has been a tendency to reduce, if
not actually to slight, the study of English
and mathematics in high school. Thus
we find that many applicants for admis-
sion to engineering programs are defi-
cient in these areas.
At the University of Michigan, courses
in mathematics and English, as well as
others, are extremely flexible and ad-
justed to the needs and abilities of the
student. A freshman who is well prepared

University by being excused from some
of the more elementary courses; the fresh-
man who lacks these basic skills, on the
other hand, may find it possible to ac-
quire them by additional work. This plan,
adopted a few years ago, has proven suc-
cessful and makes it possible for com-
petent freshmen who have not had the
opportunity for an adequate preparation
in mathematics and English to start their
college work at a level adjusted to their
requirements. However, it is recommend-
ed that every high school student prepare
himself thoroughly by acquiring as much
skill as possible in mathematics, English
and in the physical sciences.
In order to supply the physical facili-
ties needed to serve the increasing num-
ber of students in engineering, the Uni-
versity of Michigan has started an exten-
sive building program on the north side
of the Huron River, designated as the
"North Campus", providing laboratories
for instruction and research in engineer-
ing and student residences. The Mortimer
E. Cooley Memorial Laboratory for engi-
neering research was dedicated in 1953-
The Michigan Memorial-Phoenix Labora-
tory for work in nuclear energy was dedi-
cated in June 1955. The automotive Lab-
oratory and the wind tunnel and propul-
sion laboratories are now completed and
will be occupied for engineering instruc-
tion and research for the spring semester
of 1956.
New developments in engineering re-
quire not only modern laboratories but
modern educational programs as well. In
keeping with this philosophy, the College
has initiated three new programs within
the last few years: Science Engineering,
Nuclear Engineering and Instrumentation
Engineering.
The Science Engineering program, de-
signed to give undergraduate students a
thorough background in modern science
and mathematics as applied to the new
developments in engineering, has proved
to be a highly stimulating curriculum
for both the students and faculty. Last
fall, the first time the program was offer-
ed, an enrollment of about fifty was an-
ticipated. Instead, approximately 1130 ap-
plicants were received, from which al-
most 100 students were selected for ad-
mission. A small second group of stu-
dents will be started in February and an-
other group each semester thereafter. The
program advances the teaching of physics
and mechanics by a full year, owing to the
introduction of differential calculus in
the first semester of the freshman year.
The first two years of the Science Engi-
neering program have now been ac-
cepted as an alternate for the traditional
freshman and sophomore work of all
other engineering curricula.
The graduate Nuclear Engineering
program, now in its fifth year, has a total
enrollment of 37, 28 students seeking
the master's degree and 9 the doctorate.
It was established to meet the increasing
demand for engineers to work in the
new and expanding field of the applica-
tion of nuclear energy for industrial uses.
The program has been augmented this
year by the addition of courses in nuclear
reactor instrumentation, wave mechanics
in nuclear engineering, and nuclear re-
actor fuels. The Phoenix-Memorial Lab-
oratory is now in operation and is being
used in nuclear engineering research and
instruction. The Laboratory's George W.
Mason Memorial Library has become the
center for atomic information on campus,
while the Ford Nuclear Reactor, under
construction adjacent to the Laboratory,
will be in operation this summer and
available for student use next fall. During
the spring semester, Nuclear Engineering
students will have an unparalleled oppor-
tunity to observe and study the principles
and techniques of reactor construction.
In 1952 the University inaugurated a
graduate program in Instrumentation
Engineering for those students who are
interested in automatic controls and the
application of electronic computers in the
control of industrial and defense opera-
tions. This is a field of major importance
in defense work on guided missiles and
aircraft, where the demand for well-train-
ed engineers is intense.
These are but a few of the special op-
portunities which have developed in the
Engineering College during the past year.
By far the largest number of students
is found in the older, well established
educational programs, and because of the
common scientific basis for most of the
engineering programs there is at present
little, if any, significant difference in the
demands for men graduating from the
different programs. Five to ten years
after graduation many engineers find
themselves doing work in another field
than that in which they studied as under-
graduates. This mobility of occupation
is an important characteristic of America
and demands a broad fundamental educa-
tional program for all engineers so that
they may take advantage of as many
different opportunities as may be later
available to them.

Richard C. Shafer, B.S. in mechanical engineering at Lehigh,
was one of 16 engineers assigned to one of Western Electric's
toughest post-war projects — developing manufacturing tech-
niques for mass-producing (with great precision!) the tiny but
amazing transistors which are already causing a revolution in
electronics.
Paul J. Gebhard, B.S. M.E. at the University
of Maryland, was one of a team that helped
develop Western's new electroforming
process for coating steel telephone wire
with copper, lead and brass in one continu-
ous operation. His job: to develop conductor
resistance-annealing equipment and electro-
lyte filtration and circulating systems.
Bobby L. Pettit (at right), an E.E. from Texas
A. &amp; M., is one of several hundred members
of Western Electric's Field Engineering Force.
These F.E.F. men can be found all over the
world — working most closely with the Army,
Navy and Air Force — advising on the instal-
lation, operation and maintenance of com-
plex electronic equipment made by W.E.
estern Electric's primary job — which goes
'way back to 1882 — is to make good telephone
equipment that helps Bell telephone companies
provide good service. It's a very big job — and a
very important one — which calls for the pooling
of varied types of engineering skills.
New manufacturing processes and methods
are constantly required to produce better tele-

WITHOUT WINGS
By TED FRIEDMAN
Within the last few months a new
breed of aircraft has come into being.
The new machines bear so little resem-
blance to conventional craft that the very
name "Plane" can no longer be applied
to them.
None of the new machines have wings,
but use their propulsive force for sup-
port. They literally rest upon a column
of air. The most spectacular of all these
ships is the Air Force's "Flying Saucer,"
which, if developed, would make use of
the so-called Coanda Effect. This is the
tendency of a jet stream to follow a con-
tour of a surface, even though it curves
away from the stream.
In the proposed "Saucer" (which
would look almost exactly like the popu-
lar conception of a flying saucer) the jet
exhaust at the top of the ship follows
the curve of the Saucer's dome by Coanda
Effect so that it shoots downward, there-
by supplying lift.
For the Birds
Meanwhile, Dr. Alexander M. Lip-
pisch, who developed the Delta Wing
and Germany's Messerschmidt 163, has
revealed an incredible flying box which
he calls the "Aerodyne" since it's sup-
ported by aerodynamic forces). Air is
sucked in through a hole in the ship's
nose by interior fans and blasted against
a venetian-blind-like mechanism. The air
stream is then either deflected down-
wards or backwards depending upon
whether vertical or horizontal thrust is
desired.
"Wings are for the birds," Lippish ex-
plains. "They heat up and increase drag.
. . . For economy you have to have an
internal flow mechanism."
However, the most important of these
new species are likely to be the one-man
vehicles known as the Flying Platforms
and the Aerocycles. If current tests being
conducted by the armed forces find them
feasible, they may revolutionize Ameri-
can life.
Hiller Helicopter's Flying Platform—
also known as the Flying Carpet and the
Flying Manhole Cover—is being tested
by the navy. It consists of a large round
base enclosing to contra-rotating fans.
The pilot stands in the center of this
platform next to the two motor-cycle
type engines. His feet are strapped down
and he holds onto a light railing.
The Aerocycle
De Lackner Helicopter's Aerocycle is
virtually the same machine except that
the base surrounding the fans is done
away with. The fans now become rotors
and the new device weighs only 200 lbs.
as compared with the Flying Carpet's 300
lbs.
On December 30 the Army bought 12
experimental Aerocycles and has been
testing them in Fort Kimler, New Jersey.
The peculiar little machines are unbe-
lievably simple. Soldiers who have never
piloted any kind of air craft begin flying
them after no more than 16 minutes in-
structions. Even "a trained bear could
do it," an official claims.
In these machines, direction of motion
is controlled solely by the positions in
which the pilot leans. When he moves
his weight in any direction the vehacle's
center of gravity shifts causing the en-
tire craft to tilt slightly in that direction
in order to maintain equilibrium. The
air stream is then being blown at such
an angle that translational thrust in the
desired direction is supplied.
The pilot only has two controls—one a
simple hand throttle and another whose
purpose is classified.
Descendants of the Helicopter
Both the Aerocycle and the Flying
Platform are merely manifestations of
the progress made since the development
of their forerunner, the helicopter. The
underlying principle of this family of
vehicles can be traced back to Leonardo
da Vinci in the 15th Century. Da Vinci
was the first to envision a machine sup-
ported by air streams. His plans for a
flying machine included a large flat
screw-like propeller over the mechanism
to supply vertical thrust. The first heli-
copter which actually flew appeared in
France in 1907, but unfortunately it

One of the many research projects
being directed by the Engineering Re-
search Institute is a five-year study spon-
sored by the American Institute of
Chemical Engineers: a study of tray
efficiencies in distillation columns. This
project was selected by the A.I.Ch.E. Re-
search Committee because of its general
interest and importance to industry, and
because the complexity of the problem
could be overcome only by substantial
group effort.
Few people have heard of theA.I.Ch.E.
Research Committee because it has only
recently been formed. Back in 1950 and
1951 it was only a dream in the mind of
Walter E. Lobo, a chemical engineer in
New York City. Mr. Lobo foresaw the
need for fundamental research in indus-
try. It was largely through his efforts and
direction that the Committee was formed
and later financed.
The Research Committee has obtained
financial support from thirty-three in-
dustrial representatives amounting to
$500,000 for the five-year period. It has
enlisted the aid of several universities in
carrying out the work, and it continually
advises and coordinates the efforts of
these schools. The fact that Michigan was
one of the universities chosen is not sur-
prising, since we have had a well-or-
ganized research program in progress
since 1920.
The distillation columns being studied
in the project are similar to those used
in industry to separate a substance from
a mixture of other substances which
have nearly the same boiling point. The
process works like this: suppose you in-
tend to isolate the substance with the
higher boiling from the rest of the mix-
ture by boiling it off. Since other sub-
stances in the mixture may also have high
boiling points the vapor might have an
excessive amount of those undesirable
substances. To rectify this condition you
pass the vapor through a distillation col-
umn and bubble it through condensed
liquid. Most of the undesirable sub-
stances are condensed out at this stage,
and the vapor which escapes passes into
a condenser, giving a liquid of high
purity.
The History of the Distillation Industry
The exact origin of distillation as a
means of liquid separation is not known,
although the Egyptians used the process
to purify water and to collect certain oils.
The Celtic people of Scotland and Ire-
land learned at a very early date to distil
alcohol from fermented grain wash, and
the Spanish Moors knew about this proc-
ess in the twelfth century. It seems likely
that the Latin term aqua vitae was used
indiscriminately by Highland clan chiefs
to describe the liquors made by distilling
wine or fermented grain. In those days
the chiefs were often acquainted with
Latin and English as well as their native
Gaelic.
The preparation of aqua vitae at that
time was confined to the household, each
family making enough for its own home.

Yes, Dave, the Du Pont Company regularly employs
students of science and engineering in its Summer Tech-
nical Training Program. The chief purpose is to provide
good technical training under industrial conditions. And
we learn about the students while they learn about us.
Students selected for the program after campus inter-
views include candidates for the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D.
degrees. Assignments are related to their academic inter-
ests. Last summer 270 students from 93 institutions
participated in the program. In this way, ties are often
established which can lead to permanent employment
after graduation.
In addition, many other students are hired directly
by individual Company units to help out during vaca-
tion periods of our regular employees. For this "vacation
relief work," assignments are likely to be varied; but
these students also gain valuable insights into industrial
practice, and many acquire experience related to their
fields of study.
Altogether, about 750 college students, from both
technical and nontechnical fields and at all levels of
training, obtained experience with us during the summer
of 1955. So you can readily see, Dave, that the Du Pont
Company attaches a lot of importance to summer jobs
for college students.

of Pan-Am Southern Corpora-

cently celebrated its 25th

How to make an exception prove a rule
Technological progress is rapid in the petro-
leum industry. Few processes have a chance to
"grow old" on the job. Most are killed off through
the combined efforts of thousands of scientists
working constantly to improve everything we do,
make or use in our business.
Every now and then, though, we experience a
happy exception to this rule. That occurs when a
new development not only meets the immediate
need but also provides the right answer to situa-
tions yet unforeseen.
Twenty-five years ago last August a process
known as "delayed coking" was invented. The
new process made a quicker, cleaner job of con-
verting heavy residual oil into gasoline, gas oil,
and coke. It paid off spectacularly when catalytic
cracking was invented and these giant new units
began calling for feed. It paid off again when the
diesel locomotive came along to put the heavy oil
burning steam locomotive out of business.
Dr. Robert E. Wilson, chairman of the board of
Standard Oil today, was the inventor of delayed
coking. Almost all of the young scientists who
worked with him in its development are still with
Standard too, in responsible positions requiring
their special skills.
Young scientists in research and engineering at
Standard Oil today find it satisfying to see their
creative efforts translated into valuable product
and process improvements.

ENGINEERING?
by PROF. JOHN G. YOUNG
V
I am sure that it is not news to most
high school students that the profession
of engineering offers tremendous career
opportunities to the youth of today. You
have all heard such statements as "The
future belongs to engineers," "We are
living in an engineer's civilization," etc.,
so that my remarks here can only add
substance to such statements by pointing
out some of the specific reasons why they
are true. In doing this I will try to
describe as realistically as possible what
engineers actually do. This is very diffi-
cult to accomplish in a short space be-
cause, as I will point out in further detail
later, engineers fill such a large variety of
positions in industry that I can only cover
a few specific examples and must treat
the others in a general way. If you are
interested in more detailed information,
I suggest you write for the pamphlet
"Engineering—A Creative Profession,"
available at 25c per copy from the Engi-
neer's Council for Professional Develop-
ment, 29 West 39th St., New York 18.
N.Y.
Engineers do Interesting and
Exciting Work.
Engineering is an active profession in
that engineers both design and do; they
plan and they produce so that they see-
the results of their efforts in tangible-
form as well as the benefits which derive
from them. More than any other group,
engineers dream of new things in a prac-
tical way and actually make their dreams
come true. There can be no greater fas-
cination than to plan a new machine,
structure, process, or product, and to see
it actually completed and in operation or
production.
This is not to say that one man de-
signs such complex products as an auto-
mobile, a steam turbine, or an automatic
washing machine single-handed. Such de-
signs require a high degree of teamwork
between many engineers, scientists, tech-
nicians, production specialists, and other
groups all contributing to the final prod-
uct. Whereas in the very early days an
automobile was simple enough for one
man to design in its entirety, the mod-
ern automobile company has large groups
of engineers specializing on each of the
many components of the design, such as
the chassis, body, engine, transmission,
tires, etc., and the individual engineer in
such a group may devote his entire atten-
tion to one phase of piston ring improve-
ment or the development of an improved
diaphragm material for the sensing unit
of the oil pressure gage. This kind of
specialized work in an organized engi-
neering department does not mian at all
that the individual engineer's scope is
limited or that he derives any less excite-
ment or satisfaction from his work than
did the designer of the early automobile.
On the contrary, the design and develop-
ment of nearly every component of a
modern car from brakes to window
lifters involves the application of more
scientific and engineering knowledge
than was used in the design of the com-
plete automobile of forty years ago. and
the satisfaction to the engineer comes
from this application of his special knowl-
edge. In fact, his satisfaction is actually
enhanced by the fact that his contribu-
tion is a coordinated part of a far greater
project than could ever be accomplished
by one man. Moreover, the fascination of
this work is no less for one part of the
"engineering team" than another. For
example, at the scientific end, the story is
told of a track inspector on the Nickel
Piatt- Railroad about sixty-five years ago
who found a young man fussing with a
strange contraption of mirrors on the
right-of-way. Suspecting a crack-pot or
worse, he asked brusquely, "What are
you doing here?" "Why," was the mild
reply, 'I am trying to measure the veloc-
ity of light." "Well, why should any

THE
BIG
SCHOOL
By CECIL MELLIN, M.E/58
Size seems to be an important factor in
the choosing of an educational institu-
tion for advanced study. And it also is
the case that the same "size" that draws
one person to a university or college, will
send another away. Nonetheless, there
are certain obvious advantages, as well
as disadvantages, found in the "BIG"
school. Since the enrollment of the Uni-
versity of Michigan is the sixth largest in
the nation, it well falls into the "big"
category. The following discussion, then,
will point out a few of these advantages
and disadvantages, inherent with bigness,
and may perhaps also give you an idea
of the conditions prevailing at the Col-
lege of Engineering, University of Mich-
igan.
The Social Aspect
Among the prominent social offerings
of the big school are large extra-curricu-
lar opportunities, an absence of social
pressure, a "lesser" group feeling, and a
generally superior fraternity system.
Because the education which the engi-
neer gets is necessarily technical, and
therefore lacking much in 'liberal"
studies, extracurricular activities have a
greater importance, for they not only help
in rounding out the student's college
life, they also serve as part of the engi-
neer's "liberal" education. Too many
engineers isolate themselves from the rest
of the campus, and after four or five years
of such isolation, are not the WELL-
ROUNDED guy that industry has been
seeking of late. It does not take any ex-
cess amount of intelligence to be active
extracurricularly, all it takes is a little
initiative on your part. And when you
come to a school as big as the University
of Michigan, which can afford such
things as a daily newspaper, monthly
campus magazines, a huge sports pro-
gram, student operas and plays, and so
many others that it would be senseless
to go on, it takes no brains at all and
very little initiative to become one of the
"actives."
On the other hand, if it takes very little
initiative to become "active" it takes no
initiative at all to lose yourself on the
campus of the large school. Because of
sheer bigness, there is a lack of social
pressure, which has its desirabilities.
There are those, call them geniuses, who
prefer solitude to group activity, and the
big school offers a place for these to
carry on their studies less conspicuously
than if they were at a smaller school,
where they might be ogled at by normal
individuals. Also, one can, at a large
school, go out with two girls the same
night without either girl or the rest of the
student body, knowing about it before
sunrise. Which has its desirabilities. A
real louse can go through the big school
and not suffer from ostracism whatsoever,
because there are too many people for
word to get around that you are a real
louse, and also, there are so many other
lice around that you'll probably fit in
anyway.
An unfortunate aspect of the large
school is its lack of, or lesser, "group"
feeling. This "group" feeling is one of
those intangibles that continually crop
up in life, and is of course less great
where there are great numbers in atten-
dance, aand where the individual feels
more insignificant. You may perhaps be
at a football game, with ninety thousand
32
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


others, and leap to your feet, cheering
with the crowd, and then find yourself
wondering what the hell you're cheering
about, for it is they, the members of the
football team that are playing, not you,
up in the altitude in row eighty-seven.
There are ways, however, of manufac-
turing some group spirit. One might
play varsity football, for one thing, and
solve his problem immediately. Of course
that takes talent. But even for the many
untalented, as was discussed before, the
ample extracurricular opportunities of the
big school will allow the individual some
chance at attaching himself to the
"group," so when he says "we" won at
the football game, he can mean it and
feel it, which is a good, wholesome feel-
ing for those in need of it. You guys that
don't give a damn if you're insignificant
can forget this paragraph.
In mentioning the fraternity system at
the big school—the joining of which, in-
cidentally, is a fine way of acquiring the
aforementioned group relationship—one
should note that one of the features that
makes it superior is that it doesn't mat-
ter whether you join or not. There is no
strain between those independent and
those in fraternities at the large school,
whereas, in some of the smaller schools,
you may either be considered "out of it"
if you stay independent, or a fool rowdy
if you do not. Other features of the big
school fraternity system are their greater
number and probable greater organiza-
tion. At the University of Michigan, for
instance, there are forty-two social fra-
ternities and twenty professional fraterni-
ties to choose from, and which, inci-
dentally, won the National Interfraternity
Conference Trophy for the year 1952-3
for having the most outstanding Inter-
fraternity program in the United States
and Canada.
The Educational Aspect
Among the more important educational
features of the large school's engineering
program are a truer engineering atmo-
sphere, offering the student more oppor-
tunity to decide whether he really likes
engineering or not; generally superior
buildings, labs, libraries, and other facili-
ties; a greater number of good professors,
but generally poorer student-teacher re-
lationships; and such things as co-opera-
tive programs with industry, where the
student alternately studies at the engi-
neering college for a semester, and works
in industry for a semester, and research
programs with government and industry,
in which student participation is allowed.
It is entirely possible that many of you
who now choose engineering as your fu-
ture vocation, and undertake engineering
studies at some educational institution,
will find that you have made the wrong
choice, that you are not doing what you
would like to be doing as your life's
work. And it is perhaps unfortunate that
you really will not know for sure that you
are going to like or dislike engineering
as a profession until you have actually
graduated and are in your chosen field.
It is here that the large engineering
school, with its truer engineering atmo-
sphere, presents a definite advantage to
prospective engineering students. At the
College of Engineering, University of
Michigan, for instance, the student will
find that almost all of his instructors
have had engineering experience on the
outside, and that they "talk" engineering
along with their teaching. Also, there arc
several societies representing the various
divisions of engineering which sponsor
field trips to various pertinent industries,
and have regularly scheduled lectures by
men from industry, concerning topics of
engineering interest.
Perhaps some of you may have in your
possession a copy of the College of Engi-
neering Announcement, University of
Michigan, for the year 1955-1956. Gen-
erally, the reading of this announcement,
or any other, for that matter, will not
lend much help towards picking out the
various "exclusive" offering of the engi-
neering schools of the nation. Most an-
nouncements, just like most advertise-
ments, lead you to believe that there is
no difference between the engineering
program offered by different institutions
—they arc all superior. However, in turn-
ing to page seven of the current Univer-
sity of Michigan, College of Engineering
Announcement, one would read, under
the heading "Facilities," of such things as
a three-hundred and sixty foot naval tank
(the country's largest college owned
tank) for test purposes, subsonic wind
tunnels, a supersonic wind tunnel capable
of attaining a Mach number of 4.5,
various types of jet and rocket motors,
libraries, and many, many other facilities
—facilities of such size and expense that
they just cannot be offered by smaller in-
stitutions. This is another of the definite
advantages of the big school, and ranges
from better reference libraries down to
better general laboratories for the ele-
mentary sciences.
On approaching the subject of teachers,
"good" and "had", one must be careful

Engineers At Top
Michigan alumni are represented in
force in the latest edition of Who's
Who in Engineering.
Only one school among the 475
which grant engineering degrees in the
United States and Canada tops the Uni-
versity of Michigan in total numbers.
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
leads all other institutions with 930 grad-
uates listed in the 1954 volume.
A total of 620 Michigan alumni are
listed, while Cornell University is in
third place with 52. Others in the top
ten, numerically, are: Purdue, Illinois,
Wisconsin, California, Ohio State, Kan-
sas and Minnesota.
Altogether, there are 17,518 individ-
uals listed in the 1954 edition of Who's
Who in Engineering. Dr. Charles J.
Baer, an assistant dean at the University
of Kansas, undertook the massive task of
tabulating the collegiate backgrounds of
the entire roster and announced his find-
ings in the October 1955 issue of Me-
chanical Engineering.
Dr. Baer's computations were based on
the institution where an individual gained
his bachelor's degree in engineering. This
means that scores of other Michigan
alumni, who gained only their Master's
degree at the University, are not counted
in his survey.
Although eight educational institutions
in the State of Michigan grant engineer-
ing degrees, the University of Michigan
was the only school listed among the top
45 in total numbers and none of the
other Michigan schools had more than
90 alumni listed in Who's Who.
Low-Cost Photosensitive Paper
A low-cost, coated paper so photosen-
sitive that it can make contact prints at
exposures of a fraction of a second has
been developed by scientists of the Radio
Corporation of America for use in a new
simplified photographic process known as
Electrofax.
Although the Electrofax paper is as
sensitive as standard photographic con-
tact papers, it compares favorably with
the low low-sensitivity papers in common
use. Created for obtaining rapid and per-
manent prints from photo negatives,
microfilm enlargements, or projected
images, the new paper has proved its
sensitivity in numerous tests, including
experimental use in a camera.
The sensitivity of the new paper has
been achieved by applying a thin layer
of a special zinc oxide in a resin binder.
The coating is then given a negative
electrostatic charge.
In the Electrofax process, the charged
coating is exposed by any of the conven-
tional photographic procedures. The elec-
trostatic charge is then reduced in the
areas erposed, depending upon the inten-
sity of the light, leaving a latent electro-
static image on the coated surface.
The latent image on the paper is de-
veloped by applying a pigmented resin
powder carrying a positive electrostatic
charge which causes the powder to stick
to the negatively charged areas on the
coated surface.
The resulting powder image is then fix-
ed permanently by baking the sheet for a

A-Power Plant and Refinery
A design for a high-pressure, water-
cooled, graphite-moderated, atomic reac-
tor plan that would produce electric
power in addition to fuel-grade plu-
tonium and other valuable isotopes was
recently described at the Geneva atomic
energy conference.
The multiple-purpose reactor would
produce 223,000 kilowatts of electric
power (approximately one-tenth the out-
put of Grand Coulee dam) and would
be basically similar to present single-pur-
pose reactors at the Hanford atomic
plant at Richland, Wash.
The design calls for 10,000 megawatt-
days of irradiation exposure per ton of
uranium. Such exposure would produce
plutonium suitable for use as nuclear reac-
tor fuel. Other radioactive elements pro-
duced would be useful in research, in-
dustrial and medical applications. It was
predicted the electric power developed
could be sold profitably for less than
seven mills per kilowatt-hour and there-
fore would be competitive with power
from conventional steam plants in many
parts of the world.
Heat would be removed from the re-
actor by recirculation of high purity-
water through process tubes to heat ex-
changers. At full power, reactor outlet
water temperature is 585° F. and the
pressure is 126 atmospheres. The heat-
ed water is then piped to heat exchanger
where steam is generated in the second-
ary loop.
The reactor moderator could consist
of a 24-foot-high rectangular stack of
graphite blocks. They would be perfor-

I CHOOSE ENGINEERING?
IContinued from page 2H)
fool make such a fuss about anything
like that?" "Because it is such corking
good fun!" The man with the mirrors
was Albert Michelsen of Case Institute
who became the great master of optics,
and whose "fun" lasted a lifetime. On
the- other hand, the project engineer who
sees his months of work on a new air-
plane landing gear strut culminated with
its safe and smooth performance on a
full-load landing, finds the same kind of
satisfaction. His sense of achievement, in
fact, is precisely the same as that of the
Wright brothers when their frail "flying
machine" first took to the air.
Engineers Do Useful, Necessory Work.
The wise choice of a career involves
considerations far beyond just "what kind
of a living you can get out of a job." One
can make a living and buy pleasures from
any kind of work, but true happiness and
the enduring satisfaction of life require-
more than performing a daily round of
prescribed duties, or the gaining of tan-
gible rewards; they require that what is
done contributes to the common good, that
it counts in terms of human welfare, that
its doer is giving more than he is getting,
that, in other words, he is paying his
debt to the past by contributing to the
future. The- engineer has the opportunity
for this kind of satisfaction to a high
degree. Virtually everything that is made
or sold or serves us today has an engineer
somewhere behind it. Food, clothing,
shelter, transportation, communications,
heat and light, and most of the material
attributes of civilization have been de-
veloped by engineers. But beyond the
physical convenience of having these
things is their effect on human welfare
and relations throughout the world. The
emerging concept of the world as a social
unit would be impossible without our
technical progress in communications and
transportation, and what will be new and
good and useful in the years ahead will
in great part be the engineer's to discover,
invent, develop, and produce.
For this reason especially, the engi-
neering profession today enjoys an en-
viable public reputation. The engineer is
generally regarded as a public benefactor,
and has behind him the prestige of a pro-
fession which has developed the very
highest philosophical and ethical stand-
ards. It is a background which should be
accepted with humility, and which can be
added to with dignity.
Engineering Offers a Great Variety
of Work.
It is a popular misconception that engi-
neering is largely confined to designing
bridges, complicated machinery, or other
such structures or objects. Actually, the
great world of engineering touches on
every phase of modern business and mod-
ern living, and as indicated in the pre-
ceding section, is basic to a great many
of them.
To get a true concept of the scope of
engineering opportunities we need to con-
sider the diversification produced by at
least three factors: the variety of indus-
tries available, the numerous types of
work which engineers perform, and the
many fields, or branches, of engineering
technical specialty. To consider the first
factor, I have already indicated that engi-
neers are involved in practically every
industry in the world. For example, we
find engineers in all kinds of manufac-
turing, agriculture, forestry, fisheries,
commerce, finance and real estate, com-
munications and public utilities, construc-
tion, education, government, insurance,
mining, professional services, transporta-
tion, and many other less prominent areas
of activity.
Considering the second factor, we find
engineers performing a great many differ-
ent kinds of work in most of these indus-
tries. In addition to the commonly recog-
nized technical functions of research, de-
sign and development of products, the
engineer is also found in many other
phases of operation, including espec-
ially the management and administra-
tion of all kinds of business activities. For
example, production engineers may be
concerned with the design of plants, tool-
ing and equipment for manufacturing or
processing, the maintenance of such facili-
ties, or the supervision of actual con-
struction or production operations. They
may also be concerned with purchasing,
inspection, production control, standards,
or any of the numerous control and
service functions in industry where they
combine their knowledge of engineering
with the problems of organization and
the directing of other people to a some-
what greater extent than the "technical
engineer." Many other engineers are
found in sales and marketing activities
where their special knowledge is needed
in applying the product to meet custom-
ers' requirements or to determine the field
requirements on which to base the engi-
neering design in the first place. Here
again the engineer requires a high degrec-
of skill in communicating and working
with other people. It is no wonder that
with engineers in so many activities that
nearly one-half of all the top level indus-
trial managers and administrators in the
country have come from an engineering
background.
We now come to the third factor,
which is the technical specialty or field
of engineering, of which there is an ever-
increasing variety. In addition to the
traditional Civil, Mechanical, Electrical,
chemical, Metallurgical, and Mining
Engineers, we now have Aeronautical.
Agricultural, Industrial, Marine, Naval
Architecture, Ceramic, Tool, Applied
Mechanics, Nuclear, and literally hun-
dreds of specialties within each of these
general fields. Obviously, we may have
many of these various specialties in any
of the different types of work from re-
search to sales which have been mention-
ed, and in addition, of course, they may
have their place in any number of the
various industries. All of these possible
combinations of industry, work, and
specialty amount to thousands of posi-
tions which probably constitute a far

greater range or scope of opportunity
than for any other vocational field.
Engineering Is a Marketable Ability.
It has often been said that a marketable
ability is the only true security. In this
respect the engineer enjoys a very high
degree of security because of the tremend-
ous shortage of engineers and scientists
which exists at present, and which gives
promise of continuing indefinitely into
the future. Specifically, the demand for
engineers in American industry last year
was over 40,000, which is almost 10%
of the total engineers now practicing and
more than twice the number of new grad-
uates during the year. To use the Uni-
versity of Michigan as an example of
what is happening at most engineering
schools in the country, we expect to
have representatives from more than 500
of the leading engineering employers of
the country visit the campus this year
for the purpose of recruiting new grad-
uates. This is an average of about one
employer for each graduate who will be
available, and, of course, many of them
have requirements reaching into the hun-
dreds.
This almost fantastic demand has nat-
urally had a strong influence on starting
salaries, so that, according to a recent sur-
vey*, technical graduates are being of-
fered from $25 to $50 more per month
at the bachelor's level than non-technical
graduates. At the University of Michigan
the average starting rate this year for
graduates at the bachelor's degree level in
engineering or science will be about
$410 per month and will be at least
$475 on the average for those receiving
master's degrees. This represents an in-
crease of about 5% over last year, and
there is every indication that it will con-
tinue to rise as the shortage continues.
Another natural effect of the engineer-
ing shortage has been an increase in the
sponsoring of scholarships for engineer-

ing students, so that such assistance is
now available even to the entering fresh-
men in many schools. Detailed informa-
tion may be obtained from the admissions
office of any school in which you may be
interested.
Engineers Have Great Futures.
Not only do engineers have a large
variety of excellent opportunities to start
with, but they are assured of good in-
comes throughout life. No other field of
endeavor holds more opportunity for in-
dividual advancement, and there is liter-
ally no limit to the income which may be
attained at the top levels of the profes-
sion. Furthermore, engineering training
has a proven value for advancement in
other fields since it teaches straight think-
ing, organization, the knowledge and
ability to do things, and a proficiency to
direct others in getting things done. I
have already indicated this by citing the
fact that 50% of our nation's industrial
executives started in business with engi-
neering training.
What Engineers Are Not.
In addition to describing what engi-
neers are, I feel I should particularly
point out two popular misconceptions
about engineers which should be avoided.
The first is that the engineer is a sort of
glorified mechanic who works with his
hands and therefore requires mechanical
aptitude and manual dexterity. This idea
is so prevalent that many young men are
steered into engineering merely because
they are "handy with their hands," only
to be disillusioned later by discovering
that, although it is frequently an asset to
be skillful in the use of tools and instru-
ments, especially in laboratory or experi-
mental work, the engineer must make his
way primarily with his head. This means
that his knowledge of mathematics, sci-
ence, and his ability to apply them to the
problems of industry and to communicate
the results both verbally and in writing
are of far greater importance than any
physical characteristics or aptitudes hi
may have.
The second misconception is at the
other extreme which is that the engineer
must be an inventive genius or mechani-
cal wizard in order to succeed. I hope it
has been clear from my description of
engineering work in the preceding sec-
tions of this article that the vast bulk of
engineering work, even in advanced tech-
nical research and development, consists
largely of the straight-forward and sys-
tematic application of already-discovered
principles and elements to new or special
conditions. Although there is a continu-
ing need for creative inventiveness, the
great majority of successful practicing
engineers have never produced a patent-
able invention, or if they did, it would
be quite incidental to their regular work
For example, the plant engineer succeeds
by selecting the most effective equipment
available for the purposes required, by
installing it in such a way that it can be
utilized most effectively, by maintaining
it in efficient operation, and by replacing
it when economical to do so. He is not
generally called upon to invent or de-
velop new or special equipment at all.
In Conclusion.
To summarize what I have been saying,
the engineering profession offers young
people today the opportunity for doing
interesting, useful, rewarding work with
a tremendous choice of positions, good
advancement, and the promise of unlimit-
ed opportunities. If these possibilities ap-
peal to you, make sure that you do not
foreclose on your chances to enter the
profession by failing to take in high
school the mathematics, English, and sci-
ence which are necessary to enter a col-
lege engineering course. If you are in
doubt as to these requirements, be sure to
consult your counselor or actual engineer-
ing college catalogs to be sure exactly
what they are before it is too late.

How to make a tube straightener true
The engineers who designed this tube
straightener were faced with the prob-
lem of building a machine that could
withstand the constant stresses of han-
dling \GVi" O.D. tubes of standard
thickness and yet provide the necessary
precision. Their answer was to mount
the two driven rolls and the five idler
rolls on Timken® tapered roller bear-
ings. Timken bearings take both radial
and thrust loads in any combination and
have the extra load-carrying capacity to
keep the rolls in rigid alignment.
o
Why TIMKEN® bearings have
high load capacity
This cross-section of a Timken tapered roller bearing
shows one reason why Timken bearings stand up under
heavy load conditions. There is full line contact between
the rollers and races. It's this full line contact that dis-
tributes the load over a wider area, giving Timken bear-
ings their extra load-carrying capacity.

not to make any sort of definite state-
ment. The excellence of teachers will vary
from school to school, and to say that the
teachers at this school are relatively good
and at that school relatively poor, one
would have to have attended both schools
and been taught by all the teachers of
both schools. I must admit that I've been
in attendance but a year and a half at
the University of Michigan and am hardly
in a position to classify schools and their
staffs. However, one might in general
say this: professors and assistant profes-
sors tend to be consistently good, and
there are obviously more professors and
assistant professors at the large school
than at the small school. Consequently
the curricula and program of the large
school will be bettered by the talents of
this greater number of professors and as-
sistant professors. Further, the ratio of
professors to instructors is generally high-
er at the large school, and thus your
chances of being taught by a professor
are increased.
As far as personal experience goes, in
my first year at the University, I had the
pleasure of being taught by six professors
and four instructors. The professors were
very good, and the instructors ranged
from very, very good to not very good at
all. However, that is neither here nor
there, and does not present any basis for
choosing a school.
While if the large school does offer a
greater number of good professors, this
advantage is partially offset by the larger
classes and poorer student-teacher rela-
tionships found there. To some of you
this factor will be very important. Prob-
ably you do not all have the same motiva-
tion for entering college. Some may be
genuinely interested in a particular phase
of nature or life, the exploition of which
you desire to make your professional
career. Others of you may be more con-
cerned with grabbing that rung above
your head on the social ladder. Such of
you are primarily concerned with getting
an education, not caring unduly about the
general educational atmosphere. Then,
there are those for which college is the
next step in life—the "thing to do,"
being more interested in the "experience"
of going to college than the acquiring of
an education. Also, some of you are com-
ing because you need this extra four
years or so to leave the adolescent stage.
At any rate, to those who would desire
to be in, call it "intimate" surroundings,
the fact that at the large school, you are
not known outside of class, and that in
class, if you don't give a damn, neither
does your professor, may be disturbing.
There are no coaxing or comforting words
of any sort. If you don't care, your pro-
fessor doesn't care, your professor does
not care if you don't do homework, flunk
all your exams, or come to class at all.
If you do care, the professor of the large
school will give you what help he can,
but it will not approach the help given
by the high school teachers who are will-
ing to stay after school five nights a
week to push you through algebra.
There is some information along this
line which perhaps may be of some
worth. I can remember when in high
school I was warned of the large classes
to be expected if I attended this Univer-
sity. While it is true that classes are large
in many of the Colleges of this Univer-
sity, I was surprised very much when I
found it to be the rule, not the excep-
tion, that classes of the College of Engi-
neering at the University of Michigan
ran much smaller in size than those at
high school. I have been in classes with
as few as ten students, and the largest
class has been under the thirty mark.
Needless to say, this situation betters
somewhat the poorer student-teacher re-
lations generally found in the large
schools.
Another attribute of the large school
is that it is big enough to attract the at-
tention of government and industry, both
for future placement of engineering grad-
uates, and for setting up research proj-
ects in which student participation is
allowed. The Engineering Research In-
stitute of the University of Michigan, if
I remember correctly, handled about eight
million dollars in contracts with govern-
ment and industry for the year '53-4. In
this program advanced students con-
tribute their talents and are paid for it.

experience, and yet still be earning.
And Otherwise
Some other factors which should be
considered, outside of the social and edu-
cational aspects, include the possible eco-
nomic disadvantages, the attraction of in-
dustry to the graduating engineers, and
the "name" factor, inherent in the at-
tendance of the large school.
Because it usually is the case that the
small schools are more convenient to your
location than are the large schools, it is
generally more economical to attend the
smaller school, rather than make the trek
to the larger one. Also, for students at-
tending a school from out of state, tui-
tion rates are much higher—being respec-
tively one hundred and two hundred fif-
teen dollars for state and out of state
students at the Michigan College of Engi-
neering last year. If a student from the
state is careful, he can get through this
university's college of engineering, living
in a dormitory, on about $1050 a year.
About two-thirds of that sum, however,
is spent on room and board, so you can

(Continued from page 50)
see the great savings one might make by
attending a school near home. Of course,
you must remember that it is likewise
costing money and time to feed you at
home, so the saving is lessened somewhat.
As you probably have heard, there is a
shortage of engineers in the nation at this
time. This puts graduating engineers in
the rather envious position of being able
to choose among jobs and firms, within
the limits of their capabilities. This is
especially true at the large schools, where
government and industry are attracted
to the graduating groups. At the Univer-
sity of Michigan, College of Engineering,
for example, most of the leading com-
panies which employ engineers visit the
school at least once a year for the purpose
of recruiting students for their training
programs and operations. Students are
notified in advance of these visits, and
are able to arrange interviews with com-
panies of their choice in order to discuss
future opportunities.
This "name" business is perhaps some-
thing which should not exist. But it is
true that the large school diploma, and
especially the University of Michigan,
College of Engineering diploma, mean*
much to prospective employers. Partially
because of a fine record for producing
top engineers, its like going to bat with
the umpire on your side for the first
pitch. After the first pitch the barter must
of course make his way on his own merit
which is as it should be, but where initial
breaks must be had, in this competitive
society of ours, it is sometimes profitable
to start play with a marked deck.
In closing, I might say that while this
may be a confusing discussion, it is in no
way a complete discussion—there is room
for elaboration and analysis. And it is
quite possible that those items which
were presented as advantages, or disad-
vantages, might be considered the con-
verse by some individuals. Howbeit, for
those who are at all worried about their
choice of schools, it might be comforting
to remember that there have been some
great men graduate from Michigan and
Cal. Tech and M.I.T., along with some
real bums, and the same holds true for
the small schools, and that, in the end.
no matter what, we shall all be ahead
anyway.
INDUSTRIES THAT MAKE AMERICA GREAT
TRANSPORTATION. ••
FREEDOM'S GIANT
We sometimes become so bemused with
its astronomical facts and figures that we
are apt to regard the transportation in-
dustry as an end in itself.
But transportation has grown into a
giant because it represents the translation
into reality of some basic precepts of de-
mocracy . . . freedom to think, freedom
to buy and sell, freedom to move about
as we please. The resultant interchange
of ideas, people and goods has inevitably
led to the development of large-scale,
efficient transportation. It is thus no ac-
cident that history's greatest democracy
should also have history's greatest trans-
portation system to serve it.
The transportation industry itself has
never lost sight of its basic origins. Cogni-
zant of its responsibility to the nation, it
has always reinvested large amounts of its
earnings in plant expansion, in engineer-
ing, in research—all for the development
of better and more efficient methods,
machines and conveyances. That is why
American cars, planes, ships and trains
are able to supply their services so effi-
ciently and abundantly.
The science of steam generation for
power, processing and heating in the
transportation industry has likewise kept
pace with the demand for greater effi-
ciency. B&amp;W, whose boiler designs power
such giant vessels as the S. S. United
States, continues to invest large amounts
of its own earnings in research and en-
gineering to discover better ways to gen-
erate steam for ships and trains, for
power plants and factories. The Babcock

could not attain motion forward or back-
ward.
It was not until 1939 that Igor Si-
korsky built the first practical "egg-beat-
er." But the basic problem with helicop-
ters is still their distressing complexity of
control.
Simultaneously one must regulate the
rotor blades' collective pitch, their indi-
vidual pitch in each position of their
cycle, and the velocity of each rotor it-
self. Otherwise no sort of stability can be
maintained.
Moreover, the price of the helicopter is
excessive and its size makes it impractical
for all but a few purposes.
The Aerocycle and the Flying Platform,
on the other hand, substitute the vector
system of control for the conventional
cyclic pitch system used in the helicopter.
Control is reduced to a matter of balance
and natural reflexes in the pilot instead
of a bewildering intellectual list of fac-
tors.
Actually the vector-system of tilting
(Continued from page 18)
the plane of the rotors is a throwback
to the system the Wrights used in their
first plane. In their flying machine too,
part of the steering operation consisted
in the operator shifting his weight.
Charles Zimmerman at Hiller Heli-
copters began toying with the old idea of
the Wright brothers in 1947. After the
idea was kicked around for some years,
the first flying platform was manufac-
tured in 1953.
Right now the main bug troubling the
Flying Platform is that if either of its
two engines should conk out, the unit
falls to the ground like a brick.
The Armys Aerocycle uses only one
engine, a 42-hp. Kiekhaefer Mercury out-
board motor mounted on the pilots stand.
A mixture of oil and white gas in its one
gallon fuel tank gives it the range of
150 miles.
It's maximum speed is 65 mph and it
can carry up to 300 lbs. Its four pontoons,
which give it its low center of gravity,
enable the unit to set down on either
land or sea.
The propellers rotate in opposing di-
rections so that no torque develops which
could start the pilot spinning helplessly.
The Effects of the Machines
Ever since the Greek legends of Daeda-
lus's fabulous flight on wings fashioned
from feathers and wax, men have dream-
ed of having personal flying machines.
Perhaps the time has already arrived
when the dreams can be realized.
The machine is so foolproof that test
pilot Phil Johnson declared "I'd let my
kids fly it." It's so small and compact that
two men can carry it. It's so inexpensive
that it could be mass produced for less
than $1,000.
One cannot help standing aghast at the
science-fiction-likc picture of a flying in-
fantry swooping down upon an enemy—
the machines as thick as locusts in the
air.
And even more fantastic, picture the
impact the vehicles could have upon civil-
ian life. They might be used at first for
such jobs as fire fighting and mail deliv-
ery. Then gradually their uses might ex-
tend into larger areas such as traffic
control and surveying. Commutors over
short distances then might begin using
the Aerocycles.
Letting our imagination run free, we
could picture a time when enlarged
Aerocycles, with a battery of propellors.
big enough for an entire family would
come into being. Conceivably, as traffic
conditions worsen, the machines would
begin to take over all the functions of the
automobile.
Suddenly man would find himself in
a world of three dimensions. Human life-
would no longer be tied to the ground.
The whole nation would be air-borne:
flying shopping centers and office build-
ings might spring up throughout the sky.
The atmosphere would be filled with a
three-dimensional lattise work of high-
ways, stop streets, and speed zones. Th;
otherwise useless ground highways and
streets below would be taken over by
huge truck trains hauling heavy freight.
Persons who have piloted the Flying
Platforms say the sensation is like "walk-
ing on air."
A Hiller executive said, "If you leave
your platform on the lawn, keep an eye
on Junior. He might fly away."

taining cylindrical fuel of slightly en-
riched uranium. Upon discharge from the
outlet end of the process tubes, the irra-
diated fuel would fall directly into a
water-filled basin.
Power would be controlled with hori-
zontal rods containing boron carbide.
Rod position inside the reactor could be
varied to control the percentage of free
neutrons absorbed by the boron. The
safety control system was described as
consisting of hoppers atop the reactor,
filled with tiny boron-steel balls. To ef-
fect emergency shutdown, the balls would
be automatically dropped into vertical
channels in the graphite. To guard
against the remote possibility of emission
of radioactive material from the reactor,
the design calls for a 225-foot spherical
steel shell to house the reactor, primary
water loop, and other components.
Finds Leaks That Almost Aren't There
Manufacturers of electronic tubes and
(Continued from page 34)
other products involving vacuum or pres-
sure systems now have a new General
Electric mass spectrometer leak detector
that can find leaks so small it would take
120 years for a thimbleful of air to get
through.
The principle of the detector is quite-
simple. Helium gas is used as an indi-
cator and is pumped into a vacuum or
pressure system. If there is a leak pres-
ent, the gas will pass through and be
picked up by the leak detector. In the de-
vice, the helium is drawn into a mass
spectrometer tube, and electrons are sep-
arated from some of the helium mole-
cules by ionization.
The ions are focused into a narrow
beam by magnetism and an electrostatic
field sends them traveling at high speed
between the poles of an "analyzing" mag-
net. This deflects them 90 degrees
through a collector split. Then the helium
ions are hurled against a collector plate
and give up their electric charge, which
is amplified to register the leak rate on a
dial.
Transistor-Operated Torpedo Control
The Bureau of Ordnance, U. S. Navy,
has announced the development of a net
ultrasonic control system for torpedoes
in which, for the first time, transistors are
used to replace completely the usual as-
sortment of electronic tubes.
Developed by scientists at Westing-
house Research Laboratories, the fully
transistorized system brings to torpedo
control all the proven advantages of
transistors, including extreme ruggednc-ss.
small size, high reliability of operation,
and low electrical power requirements.
The purpose of the control is to auto-
matically direct the path of a torpedo to
an enemy target. It does this by utiliz-
ing sound waves in the water. Once the
torpedo is launched, the control "takes
over" and causes the torpedo to seek out
and follow its target without human
assistance.
Transistors are particularly suited for
use in electronic control circuits and
especially this torpedo control. In addi-
tion to their other advantages, transistors
do not require high-voltage direct current
for their operation as do electronic tubes
Transistors can operate directly on the
low voltage of the torpedo battery. This
eliminates a separate source of electric
power and makes the control system
more simple and compact. Furthermore,
the total power required is only one-
tenth that of an equivalent control using
electronic tubes.
Another advantage of transistors lies
in the fact that they do not have heated
filaments, which require 'warm up' time.
This means that the transistorized torpedo
control is ready for instant operation,
without the usual delay of 30 seconds
or more, which electronic tubes need for
'warm up' and stable operation.

ACROSS THE STRAITS
(Continued from page 13)
Weighing 107 tons each, the sections
were assembled ashore, towed into po-
sition on barges and lowered into place
by floating derricks.
Once workmen secure the sheet piles
and bracing in place, derrick boats with
clam shovel buckets scoop out the bottom
from within the cofferdam. With the
sheet piling serving as exterior forms,
and the bracing providing additional re-
inforcement, the concrete for the pier
base is poured under water. When the
base hardens, the cofferdam is pumped
out to facilitate the remaining concrete
pouring.
Throughout the entire bridge, con-
creting operations are accomplished by
the grout-intrusion method. Used fre-
quently by the Michigan Highway depart-
ment and other agencies for making con-
crete both above and under water, the
method is undergoing its first extensive
underwater use. This technique of dump-
ing the gravel into place first and then in-
jecting the mortar under pressure, mini-
mizes possible storm damage by quickly
balasting the cofferdam.
Except for the anchorage piers, all con-
creting is being done underwater, with
the mortar gradually displacing the frigid
straits water until a point eight feet be-
low the surface is reached. Cofferdams are
pumped out and construction continues in
the "dry" from that point. Only in the
case of the two anchorages did concret-
ing take place without dewatering the
cofferdams.
Caissons
Like the piers built with cofferdams,
the two tower piers and the south cable
rest pier, built with caissons were also
concreted underwater to eight feet below
the surface of the water.
Perhaps the most spectacular phase of
construction was accurately sinking the
two huge caissons for the tower piers into
position. Tugs towed the 48 foot lower
sections of the 116 foot diameter caissons
from the assemblying site at Alpena,
Michigan. Then, the huge forms were
eased into the exact position by forcing
the caisson into its "corral."
A "corral" for a caisson consists of
four steel towers firmly positioned around
the perimeter of the caisson. After three
of the towers are in place, the caisson is
maneuvered against them and the fourth
tower is lowered into position. All four
towers are then joined together to rigidly
enclose the caisson and the caisson can
be sunk accurately to the exact spot re-
quired.
The caissons for the tower piers were
similar in size to king-sized donuts, with
a diameter of the opening in the center,
which served as one huge dredging well,
measuring 86 feet in diameter. The ex-
terior and internal circular walls of the
caisson were 15 feet apart. The space be-
tween the two walls narrows down to a
thin cutting edge at the toe and was
divided into eight water-tight compart-
ments.
Once the caissons were in exact position
above the pier site, these compartments
were filled with water, sinking the cais-
son. As the top of the caisson neared
water level, workmen stopped the sinking
operation and built up the walls of the
caisson with prefabricated sections. They
repeated the process until the cutting edge
became firmly embedded into the bottom
of the straits. By progressively dredging,
placing concrete in the compartments and

building up the walls, the caissons were
driven through the bottom to founding
depth.
The caisson for the cable rest pier on
the south side, rectangular in shape, was
sunk in the same manner. Within the 82
foot length and 44 foot width of the
caisson were 21 separate dredging wells,
each nine foot in diameter.
Superstructure
With the main foundations in place by
July of 1955, The American Bridge Di-
vision of United States Steel, armed with
their $44,542,900 superstructure contract,
began erecting the two 552 foot main
towers .When winter called a halt to
construction operations, the 400 man crew
had completed the erection of the towers,
the rivet operations were nearly com-
pleted and the 30 ton saddles which
cradle the main cable were in place at the
top of each tower. Hampered by the 9°-
20° Michigan temperatures, workmen
ended the construction season by floating
the north and south backstay spans into
place.
The towers reach the height of a 46
story building and one shaft in each tower
contains a service elevator to provide con-
venient access to all parts. Connecting the
two shafts of each tower are horizontal
struts of open truss construction which
Stienman designed to transmit the lateral
wind forces to the pier.
Throughout the entire design of the
superstructure, a primary consideration
has been achieving maximum aerodynamic
stability. A safety factor of 2y2 gives the
bridge security against wind forces of 50
pounds per square foot. The greatest
wind velocity ever recorded in the area
has been 78 miles per hour, or 20 lbs./
sq. foot.

models of the suspended spans, and re-
tained as a consultant was Professor D. J.
Peery of the Aeronautical department.
His work, which took place during the
summer of 1954 involved calculating the
vibration frequencies and modes of the
models which were subjected to wind
tunnel tests.
Steinman, according to his reports,
was not attempting to design a bridge
that would resist the effects of aero-
dynamic instability, but one that would
reduce the causes. Relatively wide spaces
between the cables and stiffening trusses,
68 feet center to center, compared to the
roadway's 48 foot width curb to curb, de-
crease wind resistance as does the use of
open steel grid construction for the two
inner traffic lanes. Wind pressure is furth-
er minimized by the use of open trusses
rather than the usual solid web girders.
The two inner traffic lanes lie next to a
two foot wide low-type center mall. This
low-type mall has several advantages, ac-
cording to the designer, for travelers will
drive closer to it than a high mall, thus
permitting a somewhat narrower traffic
lane next to it. In emergencies, vehicles
can be detoured across it, and more direct
access is allowed to vehicles requiring
tow trucks.
Width of the inner traffic lanes are
11 feet, while the outer lanes are 12
feet. A three foot emergency walk was
also included in the design.
Alongside the 3,800 foot main span
are side spans of 1800 feet and unloaded
backstays 470 feet long. With the use of
a double system of horizontal trusses in the
suspended span, as compared to the con-
ventional single truss system, and a 38
foot stiffening truss height, the designer
claims that the Mackinac Bridge is "the
most stable suspension bridge, aerodynam-
ically, that has ever been designed."
When the 1956 building season opens,
sometime during March, catwalks will be
erected allowing the spinning of the
main cable to begin around July 1. The
spinning of the two foot diameter main
cable from 37 strands of 348 wires each,
promises to be another spectacular job.
Spinning will take place on a 24 hour
basis for about four months.
Meanwhile, construction will continue
on the truss spans on both sides of the
suspension bridge. Spans of up to 560
feet in length are used on the south
section of the bridge because costs pre-
vent placing piers in the center of a 174
foot deep secondary rock gorge which
lies between Mackinaw City and the
South Anchorage. The spans are bal-
anced by similar, though shorter, spans
on the north section of the bridge.
Approaches
This north approach section of the
bridge makes use of a 3500 foot cause-
way constructed in 1940 for possible use-
as a ferry dock. The causeway is being
built up where the clay foundations per-
mit and a viaduct is being built over it.
For the Mackinaw City approach on the
south side of the Straits, steel girders with
concrete paving resting on concrete piers
will be used throughout. An additional
traffic lane in each direction, making a
total of six, provides a traffic reservoir
and insures that the capacity of the bridge
will not be controlled by street inter-
sections in Mackinaw City.
Travelers will pass through the St.
Ignace end of the bridge on a fourlane
roadway which separates at the intersec-
tion with US 2 to accommodate traffic
turning westward and that continuing
north towards Saulte Ste. Marie. Here at
St. Ignace, travelers will pay their tolls,
tentatively set at $2.10 per passenger car,
which pay for the all-year, direct, time-
saving 70 year old dream that is linking
together Michigan's two peninsulas.

This should be about the right time of
the right month for a problem which
Technic staffers aver is a teaser. It came
to our attention via The Ohio State Engi-
neer, but, as all good things supposedly
do, it originally came from Texas, from
the Texas A &amp; M Engineer for December
'54 specifically.
It seems that in those parts the mechani-
cal engineering students have time and
inclination to indulge themselves in a
course known as Dynamics of Lipstick
Distribution 404. It is a course designed,
among other things, to foster the engi-
neer's love of experiment. A typical page
in the lab guide might read:
"Besides the women, (who make up the
second of two willing surfaces) the only
other experimental apparatus necessary is
the lipstick and a standard 200-mesh
linen handkerchief that must be unstarch-
ed. The results should be placed in order
around the edge of the handkerchief with
notes as to temperature, pressure, light
intensity, etc. As many as 150-200 deter-
minations may be run in the course of
an evening under normal operating con-
ditions. If the signs of passion are very
strong, disregard the results of the test,
but continue the experiment until all
signs of passion are dissipated."
The appendix would necessarily in-
clude this list of variables and symbols
involved in the problem:
P—pressure (Ibs./sq. in.)
N—number of applications minute
T—temperature (degrees centigrade)
Aj—area of transmitter (sq. cm.)
A._&gt;—area of receiver (sq. cm.)
p—pucker factor (units of desire)
t—time of application (seconds)
S—surface conditions (cm/milligram)
I—intensity of light (scandal power)
D—distribution (milligrams/sq. cm.)
R—passion
Whatever their lab manual may be like,
we know that the students reached some
Compiled by BETSY PALMER
interesting conclusions which you might
like to verify: As might be expected, dis-
tribution was found to be a direct func-
tion of pressure. An inverse proportion-
ality exists between lipstick distribution
and the intensity of light, the experimen-
ters stated. As light becomes brighter,
less and less lipstick is distributed. The
amount dispersed in total darkness, all
other variables remaining nearly constant,
is assumed to be infinite. Unfortunately
such ideal conditions can only be approx-
imated.
Temperature, passion, and time of each
application are all closely related varia-
bles, each of which were reported to have
a direct effect on distribution. Experi-
ments proved that passion increased as a
direct result of the increase in the length
of time for each application.
From these general conclusions the
following two formulas were derived:
R = P'NT- -f t3/I6
D = (P -f A,A.,)TN - t2 + p/P
It is readily seen that the S factor has not
been incorporated into these expressions.
It is also "intuitively obvious" that there
is a relationship between p and R, which
would make the results above question-
able, if not openly controversial.
On the other hand, assuming that ele-
mentary mathematical relationships can
be derived for these quantities may be
violating a postulate phrased by a well-
known college administrator in reply to
student-husbands' requests for an account-
ing course for housewives: "There is no
accounting for women."
On this note we leave you to gather
your own data and reach your own con-
clusions.
One Friday night a math major said to
his cute-but-dumb little chick: "I am
twice the age that you were when I was
your age. When you get to be my age
our ages will total 63 years. How old
are we?" Since she was dumbfounded and
couldn't answer, he went on to answer
his own riddle. What did he say?
Here's one that is unadorned by extra-
curricular frivolities: A uniform solid
body of conical shape floats in water
point down with one inch of its six-
inch height projecting above the water.
The cone has a base six inches in diam-
eter. What is the specific gravity of the
cone expressed to the nearest hundredth?

Answers to last month's teasers:
A phonograph needle travels just the
radial distance from the outside to the in-
side of the grooved portion, in this case
3 inches. The needle doesn't travel
around the record; the record turns. The
needle is stationary except for its move-
ment toward the center of the record.
Eleven and 1.1 are two numbers com-
posed only of ones whose sum and prod-
uct are equal.
Failure to take both square roots re-
sulted in a "proof" that 1 = 2. The solu-
tion 1 — 3 + 9/4 = 4 — 6-}- 9/4;
(1 —3 2)2 = (3/2 — 2)- is more accept-
able.
Five words, each with a double vowel,
such that there is one word for each dif-
ferent vowel, are: aardvark, seed, skiing,
tooth, and vacuum.
The one for the card sharks was fishy:
Since the neutral cards were paired, the
number of black pairs must equal the
number of red pairs, and we will always
have the same number of cards at the end
of the game. Thus you will lose your en-
trance fee of a dollar every time you
play, and the possibility of a financial
gain is zero.

The removal of erection stresses by this
method was first tried on the Rainbow
Bridge at Niagara Falls, but the correc-
tion of stress distribution in this manner
is thought to be an original attempt.
The span, a highway bridge over
Inoura Narrows at the mouth of Omufa
Bay in the northwest of Kymushu Island,
is intended to speed traffic traveling be-
tween Nagasaki and Sasebo. The center
span is 800 feet long and is supported
by the braced fixed arch. Total length of
the bridge is approximately 113 feet.
Reactor "Swimming Pool" Complete
The concrete foundation of the 40,000-
gallon "swimming pool" that will house
the uranium fuel of The University of
Michigan's Ford Nuclear Reactor has
taken shape on the new North Campus.
Part of an intricate foundation that
has been under construction since June,
the pool bottom is a U-shaped area 35
feet long, 23 feet wide, and 12 feet deep.
From this base, the reactor pool walls
will rise to a height of 26 feet. They
will be six and one-half feet thick for
the lower 16 feet of the pool—the area
in which the reactor core will be located
—and three and one-half feet thick at
the top.
Eight-hundred-ten tons of special high
density barytes concrete will go into the
reactor pool walls. The mixture will be-
more than 60 percent denser than ordin-
ary concrete.
The U-M Memorial-Phoenix Project is
building the reactor as an addition to its
51,500,000 Phoenix Memorial Labora-
tory, newly-completed structure for atomic-
research.
A gift of $1,000,000 from the Ford
Motor Company Fund has made the reac-
tor possible. When finished, it will be
the most powerful private reactor in the
nation, with a maximum operating power
of one million watts.
The reactor building—a windowless
four-story cube—is scheduled for com
pletion in December, reports Dean Ralph
A. Sawyer, director of the Phoenix Proj-
ect.
Following inspection of the facility
and the issuance of an operating license
by the Atomic Energy Commission, an
enriched uranium fuel supply will be
shipped by the AEC late this year, he
adds.
The fuel elements will be installed as
they arrive, Dean Sawyer adds. Made up
of 20 aluminum assemblies, each con-
taining 18 aluminum clad aluminum-
alloy strips, the reactor core will be sus-
pended beneath 20 feet of water from a
bridge across the top of the pool.
A self-sustaining "chain reaction" will
be started shortly after installation of the
fuel. The power of the reactor will then
be increased slowly over a period of a
few months, until it reaches an average
operating level of 100,000 watts.

(Continued from page 24)
The clan chiefs then translated literally
from Latin and called it uisgebreatha,
which means water of life in Gaelic. It is
easy to see how the term spread and
eventually took the form whiskey in Eng-
lish.
From the 15th to the 18th centuries
whiskey gained steadily in popularity,
and stills popped up all over the coun-
tryside. They were similar in construction
to the typical bootlegger's still of our
day, consisting of a pot vaporizer, a con-
denser, and a receiver. Little was done
to increase the efficiency or the output of
distilleries until they began to be used in
industry in the 19th century.
Between 1820 and 1900 there was an
increased demand for such products as
industrial alcohol and kerosene, and it
became necessary to find an efficient meth-
od to separate these products from a
mixture of other substances. There were
many ideas for low-production fraction-
ating columns, but few ideas were used
in industrial processes. The one which
proved the most feasible and is now
commonly used in the petroleum and
plastics industries is the bubble cap or
bell column.
This type of distillation column con-
sists of a number of trays or plates in a
tall cylinder. Condensed liquid is main-
tained at a constant level in each tray and
the ascending vapor is forced to bubble
through the liquid by means of slotted
bells placed over the vapor tubes. The
vapor which condenses on the trays re-
turns to the vaporizer. The vapor which
bubbles all the way to the top of the
column escapes to the condenser and is
collected as a pure liquid.
Significance of the ERI Project
The tests being conducted in this proj-
ect are used to gain information concern-
ing the effect of many system properties
on the efficiency of the trays in the dis-
tillation column. System properties may
include the size of column, rate of liquid
flow, rate of gas flow, liquid holdup on
the tray, and size and layout of the bubble-
caps.
The University of Michigan and North
Carolina State College are each using one-
foot columns to test a large number of
systems using both gases and liquids.
The University of Delaware is using
a two-foot column to note any difference
between small and large columns.
The first two years of this project were
spent mostly to design and perfect meas-
uring devices, and to compare the results
of the small columns with the large one
in Delaware. We are now in the fount
year of the project. The small column-
at Michigan and North Carolina have
been used to test many mediums and to
graph the effect of such variables as ga»
rate, liquid rate, and gas pressure over
a wide range of systems. The large
column at Delaware has been used to
find the effect of high pressures, and i*
now working with various bubble cap
sizes and arrangements.
In industry the designer of a bell col-
umn uses methods which have been work-
ed out by past experiences. Any devia-
tion from these methods or from com-
mon practice makes the performance or
the final product quite unpredictable. Lack
of any better method restricts the designer
somewhat and prevents him from trying
new ideas.
The data obtained from these tests
should provide methods of predicting the
performance of any given distillation
column, and will reduce the designer'*
job to one of calculation. The results of
this project will modify engineering and
designing practice in the distillation in-
dustries. It is quite likely that in the
long run industry will be more than re-
paid for their support of this project.
Hailing from Iron River, Michigan, in the Upper Peninsula, is Dave O'Brien,
author of Tray Efficiency in Distillation Columns. The mechanical engineering senior
plans to enter the field of construction equipment, partially because he "likes outdoor
work." He has worked for various construction firms during recent summers and during
the past summer worked for Bell Telephone as a plant trainee. A member of Pi Tau
Sigma, the engineering honorary, Dave also served as vice-president and socialchairman
of Scott House.

the operation of the plant's two big
blast furnaces—each with a rated out-
put of 1500 tons per day.
Jim feels that the opportunities for
graduate engineers are exceptional at

HOSE SWALLOWS
HAMMER
AKRON, OHIO-In the development of
automotive power steering, engineers
had to find a short length of hose that
would take the pressure rise from 0 to
nearly 600 psi in a fraction of a sec-
ond. Every type hose known, in lengths
up to 100 feet, was tried without suc-
cess. Vibration and noise from hydraulic
hammer made commercialization
impossible. They turned to Goodyear
for help.
The Goodyear team of engineers tackled
the job. They came up with a special
hose, only 13 inches long, that with-
stood over 600 psi — a hose that swal-
lowed the hydraulic hammer. And, this
new hose resisted attack by oil, grease
and hydraulic fluid. The result was
practical, dependable power steering.
The rapid, economical solution to this
seemingly impossible problem is another
example of the technical skill that has
made Goodyear "the greatest name in
rubber." Challenging technical prob-
lems like this are solved every day by
the Goodyear team of Chemical,
Mechanical, Electrical, Civil and
Industrial Engineers.

THE GREATEST NAME IN RUBBER
MARCH, 1956


Having seated ourselves in the editorial sanctum with the purpose of set-
ting down in permanent form for the benefit of posterity some of the gems of
wit and humor with which we are so richly endowed, it is somewhat of a shock
to find that we have propped our pedal extremities upon the desk, fixed our
gaze upon a fly-speck on the opposite wall, and have been calmly meditating
on the largeness of Life. Oblivious to the hustle and bustle of the world about
us, we recline in quiet contemplation of the cosmos and even the harsh voice of
the managing editor reminding us that the dead-line draweth nigh and ad-
vising us to bestir ourself fails to rouse us from our reverie. For the moment we
are pondering the maxims of that ancient Chinese philosopher, Sling Bull, in
whom was the wisdom of the ages.
It was Sling Bull who, counseling the young men that sought his words,
said, "He who burns the midnight oil may be wiser than he who burns the
candle at both ends, but, I ask you, who has the most fun?"
It was Sling Bull who said, "God in His wisdom made man before woman;
man in his ignorance didn't know enough to take advantage of his head-start."
And who was it who said, "The love of money may be the root of all evil
but what grieves us most is that so much of our affection is unrequited?" You're
right, it was Sling Bull.
In fact Sling Bull is credited with many wise sayings. It was he who said:
A hick town is the place where you can move into a house and not smell
the nationality of the last tenent.
That men marry for convenience, that woman marry for convenience, and
that the former are disappointed.
That there are two classes of pedestrians, the quick and the dead. That
there are two types of professors, the dead and the buried.
That the easiest way to raise potatoes is on a knife.
That an Ann Arbor kitchenette is a telephone booth with running water.
That now that plump figures are coming back the girls can drink their beer
and have IT too.
That the Lifebuoy ads have ruined the business of the B and O railroad.
That the distinction between a flat and an apartment is six yards of braid
on the doorman's arm.
That Wafflehanger, '62E, has been married thirteen times and is now en-
gaged to the dean of women.
That you cannot judge a man by his wife but by the women he has loved.

ATOMIC ENERGY
OF
By HANK KERR, Sci.E. '59
How the atom is being converted to peacetime use, as shown in a sur-
vey conducted by the University of Michigan's Industrial Program.
Many nuclear processes have been developed that are revolutionizing
the industrial scene. We are on the threshold of the atomic age.
The prime use of this huge
Betatron of the Army Ord-
nance is in x-raying tanks as
they leave the production
line of the tank arsenal. The
chief radiographic techni-
cian of the laboratories divi-
sion, and two of his assistants
make adjustments for taking
radiograph of turret to spot
flaws.
Since the advent of the atomic age,
marked by the mushrooms over Hiro-
shima and Nagasaki in 1945, the develop-
ment of atomic fission into a controllable
and useful source of energy has become
an issue of paramount interest to indus-
tries and nations throughout the world.
Nuclear energy used for peaceful pur-
poses has uncovered vast regions of re-
search yet to be explored and developed
by industry. In November of 1954 the
University of Michigan's Engineering In-
dustry Program published "A Peacetime
Survey of Nuclear Energy from an Indus-
trial Viewpoint", compiled and written
by Marx Weech and J. J. Bulmer, to
summarize the progress made in nuclear
development, the problems encountered,
and the aspects yet to be explored. This
survey provided not only an excellent
basis for this article, but moreover, shows
the significant type of work that is being
done by the Industrial Program whose
operation and purpose is described in
this tissue of The Technic.
What exactly is nuclear energy? In its
narrowest definition nuclear energy is
production of power from nuclear fission.
However, the term nuclear energy in-
cludes not only power production but
also many of the activities that are neces-
sary to make a nuclear reactor operation
possible and the by-products of a nuclear
reactor. Therefore the scope of industrial
participation is widespread. It includes a
manufacturer that makes a valve installed
in a plant that processes reactor fuels to a
chemical company or hospital that uses
radioactive tracers in following the phases
of a chemical reaction. On this basis most
of the United States' manufacturers are
participating in some phase of the- de-
velopment of nuclear energy. These man-
ufacturers include such leaders in indus-
try as DuPont, General Electric, Bendix
Aviation, Ford Motor Company, and
Standard Oil.
Fission and Reactors
Most of the industrial applications of
nuclear energy depend on heat either as
the product or as the by product of a
reactor. An example of this is nucleo-
electric power which can be produced by
using heat from a thermal reactor to run
turbines. Therefore, a brief description of
self-sustaining fission and classification of
reactors is needed.
In a discussion of reactors, a definition
of fission and some basic understanding
of why fission occurs and the subsequent
energy released becomes necessary.
The process of self-sustaining fission is
started by a neutron hitting the nucleus
of a fissionable atom. The target atom
splits into two particles with a release of
considerable heat energy and of more
than one neutron. These emitted neutrons
cause additional atoms to fission; conse-
quently, the process is self-sustaining. A
possible fission reaction of U-235 is as
follows:
^U235 + 0N&gt; -&gt; ,,7La»- + :uBrs; +
2oN&gt;
The reason a nucleus fissions with low
energy neutrons is that the structure of
the nucleus is unstable. A neutron enter-
ing the fissionable nucleus is the activa-

fission from one atom of U-235 is about
192 mev (2.9 X10"" Btu Per fission).
Also 2.5 neutrons, on the average, are
ejected per atom of U-235 fissioned by
thermal neutrons.
An industrial reactor is a device that
converts the energy locked up in the
nucleus of a fissionable material into
usable thermal energy at a controlled rate.
These reactors are classified usually by
two methods. One method is by the aver-
age energy of the neutrons in their cores.
In this classification the neutron energies
are divided into three levels—thermal,
intermediate, and fast. A second method
of classification is by the nature of the
fuel elements used. In this method a re-
actor having a continuous fuel system,
such as a solution of uranium in water, is
a homogeneous reactor. A reactor having
lumps of metal spaced in a fluid or
graphite moderator is a heterogeneous
reactor.
A convenient energy term commonly
used when referring to neutron energies
is the electron volt. After fission in a
uranium nucleus, neutrons are emitted
with a probable energy of one million
electron volts (1 mev). This energy is
the maximum energy at which a reactor
can function. The table shows the energy
regions in which reactors are classified.
Energy Average Average-
Region Electron-Volts Velocity, ft./sec.
Thermal .025 7,200
Intermediate 1,000 1,400,000
Fast 1,000,000 45,000,000
The advantages of the thermal reactors
are that the critical mass is small, and
the fuel costs are therefore nominal com-
pared to the other reactors. With small
core size, bulk shielding is minimized.
The high unit power per unit weight or
volume is a considerable advantage for
propulsion power application. However,
the main disadvantage is the necessity of
a moderator to slow down the neutrons
from fission energies, and good modera-
tors, such as heavy water, are very expen-
sive. Also many materials have large neu-
tron capture cross sections in this ther-
mal range. This factor severely limits the
choice of construction materials for ther-
mal reactors.
The advantages and the disadvantages
of an intermediate reactor lie between
those of the thermal and fast reactors. Its
core size must be larger than the thermal
reactor, but a wider selection of con-
struction material and coolants is avail-
able.
The usually small neutron-capture cross
sections of the fast reactor offers man;,
advantages, in that a wide range of con-
struction materials and coolants can be
used. Thus, this reactor type utilize?
liquid metal coolants and core materials
that will withstand higher temperature?
Higher temperatures mean higher thermal
efficiencies in steam generation and tur-
bine cycles. The disadvantage of this type
is the large quantities of fissionable ma-
terial required to reach the critical size.
Both fuel and shielding costs are subse-
quently much higher than the other two
reactors.
The method of classification by fuel
type, homogeneous and heterogeneous,
was explained. The homogeneous reactor
has a continual fuel system while th:
heterogeneous reactor has lumps of radio-
active metal spaced in a moderator, a
"poison."
Electric Power Plant
The most direct industrial use ot the
nuclear reactor is the production of nu-
cleo-electric power. At the present time,
there exists no economical method to' ex-
tract the energy in fissionable materials to
be used for t(iis purpose. The most effi-
cient process is to permit the fissioning
to generate heat, use this heat to form
steam, and then expand the steam in a
turbine to generate electricity. This energy
transformation allows about 20% effi-
ciency at present reactor temperatures ac-
cording to the survey. Thus, only one-
fifth of the reactor energy reaches the
transmission line as electrical energy.
The average energy from a uranium
fission is about 192 million electron volts.
On this basis, with coal at S7 per ton and
with a heating value of 12,000 Btu per
lb., a gram of uranium is worth about
$22. This value assumes that all of the
gram of U-235 fissions; this is not com-
pletely true, since some of the uranium
undergoes neutron capture and conse-
quently does not fission. A more realistic
figure is $18.50 which accounts for the
neutron capture process in a thermal re-
actor.
Despite these rather discouraging
facts Duquesne Light Co. started con-
struction of the first large-scale atomic
power plant last July, for the Atomic
Energy Commission, near Chippington,
Pa., which is located on the Ohio River,
about 25 airmiles from Pittsburgh. It is
expected that the plant will begin oper-
ating within three or four years. The re-
actor is the light-water cooled and mod-
erated, slightly enriched uranium type—
an intermediate reactor. The plant em-

Uses of Gross Fission Products
The uses of the radioactive material
tHat is left in the reactor after fissioning
or the chemical reprocessing of the re-
actor fuel are seemingly infinite. One
widely discussed area of investigation lies
in the potential use of gross fission prod-
ucts (the remainder of a chain reaction)
as sources of energy from which heat can
be obtained. The development of such
heat sources is based upon the processing
of gross fission products which yield a
highly concentrated activity and can be
maintained for long periods of time at
high temperatures. Obviously this would
entail the solution of the major problems
of handling, storage, and transportation.
Dependent upon the energy level and
temperature conditions, it appears that
generation of steam from such packaged
fission-product sources can be developed.
The development of utilities for concen-
trating energy sources will mean the reso-
lution of many technological problems.
However, if these problems are resolved,
the result could be the application of con-
centrated gross fission products in heat-
ing, ventilating, and refrigeration. These
possibilities are due to the reversibility of
such high temperature energy for refrig-
eration as can be seen in the modern
gas-burning refrigreator. Of course, this
utility would be confined to large installa-
tions because of the need of remote loca-
tion and heavy shielding for the generat-
ing unit.
Uses of Radiation Effects
The rest of the applications of nuclear
energy for industrial uses generally result
from the radiation effects of fissioning.
When an atom of U-235 is fissioned, a
beta particle and gamma ray are given off.
Both have irradiating effects; the gamma
ray being the more powerful of the two.
These effects are very useful in chemical
processes, sterilization and preservation
of foodstuffs, static elimination in textile
and paper mills, and medicine.
A number of applications in radiation
chemistry have been suggested in the
Stanford Research Institute Report, Indus-
trial Uses of Radioactive Fission Products.
One of the fields of interest which offers
vast opportunities for improvements and
products is polymerization, the process
used in the production of long chain
molecules. These improvements could be
made by using gross fission products
Preliminary studies have indicated that
gamma-radiation-promoted chemical poly-
merizations could compete economically
with conventional methods of produc-
tion. The University of Michigan has been
investigating the chlorination of aromatic
compounds and the polymerization of
olefins, using a high-level source of gam-
ma radiation.
In addition to experiments on chemical

vestigations have been conducted at the
University of Michigan on the pasteuriza-
tion and sterilization of foods. Frozen
foods, canned fresh foods, fresh meats,
vegetables, and grains have been studied
to determine the effects of gamma radia-
tion on the storage, taste, and wholesome
properties of foods.
The results of these studies have led
to the design of radiation facilities to
pasteurize meat and prevent sprouting
in potatoes and onions, and another for
the chlorination of aromatic compounds.
An example of the facilities considered
for pasteurization of meat is shown in the
figure. In this design, the meat to be
radiated is brought past a radiation source
on a conveyor mechanism. The amount
and time of exposure depends upon the
desired effect.
The uses of the fission products men-
tioned thus far have been on their use as
a source of energy and their ability to
kill microorganisms. Possibilities for large
scale use of radiation effects are tracers.
The basic idea of the tracer technique
is to mix some radioactive isotopes among
the stable isotopes of a test material.
Since radioactive atoms can be observed
by their radiations, they indicate the posi-
tion and amount of test material in some
process.
The use of these radioactive tracers in
quantitative analysis of chemical reactions
can revolutionize the present methods of
analyzation. The detection and estima-
tion of one element in a mixture is some-
times impossible, either because it is pres-
ent in very small quantities or because the
other components have similar chemical
properties. In both cases, a nuclear re-
actor may be useful. If the mixture to be
analyzed is irradiated with thermal neu-
trons, inside a reactor, the components
will generally be activated in different
ways making it possible to identify them
by their radioactive decay. For example,
hafnium and zirconium have almost iden-
tical chemical properties, and ordinary
methods of analysis of Hf-Zr is very
hard. When irradiated in a reactor, the
identification of these two elements be-
comes a simple problem to solve.
Some of the other uses of tracer iso-
topes are studies in flow components of
process operations, metering of fluids
such as the control of the various gases
through pipelines, and leak detectors in
pipelines. The determination of friction,
wear and corrosion may prove easy. For
example, the walls of a blast furnace arc-
lined with 2 or 3 feet of firebrick which
wears away after a few years. It is im-
portant to know when the thickness is at
the point where it needs replacing. A
simple method of obtaining this informa-
tion is to put a small pellet of ''"Co at
the correct depth when the furnace is
built. When the wall wears down to this
point the cobalt disappears in the molten
metal and, by occasional checks with a
Geiger-Muller counter, the time for re-
placement is indicated quite accurately.
Radioisotopes have been successful in
eliminating static accumulation in flour
mills, cement industries, and paper and
textile plants. Mostly, natural-occurring,
radioisotopes have been used. Thus, this
fision-product radiation will help reduce
the fire and explosion hazards found in
these types of plants. It is also used in
thickness gauges which art repLic
the older methods of quality control /or
the production of such materials as .abra-
sive papers, plastic sheets, and metal foils-
Thickness guages are based on the ab-
sorption of certain radiations into- the
sheet of moving material. Irregular ab-
sorption causes variations in machine con-
trols that offset the cause of the irregu-
larity. This method permits a continual
correcting factor to operate without dam-
aging the material by surface pressure*
of rollers as occurred in the older type of
servomechanisms.
The utilization of beta particle radia-
tion will revolutionize the modern tech-
niques of radiographing. The beta particle
penetrates material faster and deeper
than any radiation source yet discovered.
This important feature can be used to
check metal castings such as motor blocks,
and automobile bodies' welded parts, and
crystalline materials, and consequently
determine any faulty structure. At the
Detroit Arsenal, manufacturer of tanks
and shoulder arms, a betatron radiator
was installed for this purpose. In fact, it
serves a dual purpose;; during the day
it checks the construction of the tanks
and their parts, and at night it aids medi-
cine in the combat against cancer. This
paradox of atomic fission used for either
the destruction or betterment of mankind
will spell the future of nuclear energy.
ome of the miscellaneous uses of fis-
sion products are a small quantity of a
radioactive material in flourescent lights
as a starter, activated phosphors for in-
corporation in luminous paint, activated
phosphorous for use as an insecticide, and

Another example of the
pioneering opportunities
for engineers at
Bell Telephone Laboratories
In a career with Bell Telephone Lahoratories,
young engineers and scientists can expect to take
part in pioneering radically new developments in the
field of communications. One such development is
the Bell Solar Battery.
Like the transistor, the Bell Solar Battery was in-
vented by Bell System scientists. Indeed, it wras the
study of semiconductors which revealed the fact that
sunlight could induce the movement of electrons in
silicon and thus create electric current.
The basic unit of the Bell Solar Battery is a thin
disc compounded of two kinds of treated silicon. The
body of the disc is silicon with a trace of arsenic to
provide negative potential. Into this body boron is
diffused, to a depth of less than 1/10.000 of an inch,
providing positive potential. The junction of these
layers of treated silicon is the "p-n" junction. Equi-
librium between the p and n regions is upset when the
disc is exposed to sunlight, which jolts electrons free,
and causes them to move across the p-n junction. The
charges pass through contacts, and current — though
a small amount — flows.
In the past year, the efficiency of the Bell Solar
llattery has been increased from 6 to 11%. Right
iiow, in Americus, Georgia, the battery is being used
experimentally to power a rural telephone system.
And more widespread application is in the offing.
The Bell Solar Battery is one of many develop-
ments underway in the Bell System to improve
America's telephone service. The special role of Bell
Telephone Laboratories in forwarding the exciting
search for tomorrow's better telephone service is
creating many fine career opportunities for young
scientists and engineers. Your placement officer can
give you more information about careers with Bell
Telephone Laboratories, and also with Bell Tele-
phone Operating Companies, Western Electric and
Sandia Corporation.
The Bell Solar Battery consists oj 432 silicon discs wired
together. It is mounted on telephone poles to catch prevailing
sunlight, and on a sunny day can produce 10 watts. Excess
energy is fed into storage batteries, to lie used at night or in
bad ueather.

Welding Processes
for Automobile
Bodies
How the automotive industry welds automobile bodys to pro-
vide a better and cheaper product.
Within the past few years welding
processes have all but replaced the rivet-
ing and bolting of parts in the fabrication
of automobile bodies. One reason for this
is that welded parts arc securely held,
lessening the chance of eventual body
noise. Cost consideration is another fac-
tor as selection of fabricating methods
for automobiles is based to a great extent
on cost. By utilizing welding instead of
other processes, there is a savings of
factory floor space taken up by equip-
ment such as riveters, conveyors and
steel handling equipment.
Welded joints, especially on exposed
portions require a minimum of expensive-
finishing to obtain a smooth surface. Also,
welding equipment has been developed
which is capable, by integrating it with
stamping press lines, of producing as-
semblies as fast as the major components
are stamped. Although the use of weld-
ing means no more than a mill or two
saved in labor or material on each car, the
total adds up rapidly.
Practically every welding techhnique is
used to some degree, in joining body or
frame parts, although probably the least
used is the familiar oxyacetylene welding
process. Applied in reinforcing joints
such as between body panels and side
support bars, it is also used where expos-
ed spot welds need filling. Low carbon
steel filter rods are generally used.
Arc welding is another process which
is used sparingly in body building. Its
application is limited to adding reinforc-
ing members such as body panel struts.
For this, a low penetration, high deposit
electrode is used.
The most widely practiced technique
is resistance welding. Being largely a
mechanized process it achieves high out-
put from unskilled workers. In this type
of welding, the parts to be joined art-
placed between two electrodes. Electric
current flows from one electrode, through
the work and to the other electrode. The
high resistance of the work to the current
causes a high temperature, which fuses
the parts.
One form of resistance welding is
seam welding. In this method, rollers on
either side of the work, act as electrodes
and move over the work producing what
basically is a series of overlapping spot
welds, called seams. In fact, by means of
a firing timer, equally spaced spot welds
can be produced. A weld of this type is
usually found on the outside of the
automobile body such as on the tail quar-
ter panel.
Another welding technique is butt
welding. Current carrying dies grip the
work pieces and hold them in close end-
to-end contact under pressure until the

ends are sufficiently heated. Welds are
made by applying this pent up pressure.
A similar process is called flash weld-
ing in which work is brought together
lightly producing an arcing or flashing
action. When the ends of the work be-
come molten, a sharp push-up from the
dies forces the molten metal out and
makes the weld in the metal behind it
which is in the plastic state. Both these
processes are used in joining frame parts
and quarter windows.
Spot Welding
The most widely used process in the
production of the car body is spot weld-
ing,—the average automobile body con-
taining over 8,000 spot welds. This re-
sults in an increase in rigidity and fa-
tigue strength.
Three spot welding techniques are
used. The first is the series spot weld.
Two tips are placed on one side of the

work and connected in series. The cur-
rent is shunted across the backing elec-
trode on the other side of the parts and
two spot welds are produced on the
metal. The second technique is the in-
direct series spot weld, used to avoid
weld marks. The backing electrodes, two
of which are used, are insulated from
each other beneath each tip in order to
prevent the current from shorting out.
The current is shunted through the work
instead of the electrode.
Finally, there is the direct spot weld
method. It is used on heavy gage steel to
produce one spot on the edge of the
panel. Two electrodes are on opposite
sides of the part and the current flows
through the metal.
Spot welding is either done by port-
able guns or stationary welding presses.
Portable guns are primarily used for sub-
assemblies and final assemblies. They are
also used to reach portions of the body
not easily accessible on welding presses.
However, with the advent of automatic
welding lines, portable guns are finding
less use.
These portable spot welding guns fall
into three classes. All types are operated
either hydraulically. pneumatically or
mechanically to get proper electrode pres-
sure and differ primarily in design only.
It is the electrode pressure which forces
the parts into intimate union after they
have been heated to welding temperature.
The first type of portable spotwelding
gun is the pinch gun. As the name im-
plies, the electrodes move together onto
the work. There are two jaws containing
the electrodes, the movable jaw and the
stationary which contains the operating
mechanism.
The second type is the expansion gun.
For these, a welding fixture is necessary,
the device being a work holding and lo-
cating device fastened to a standard
welder as part of the complete machine.
The current is conducted from the upper
electrode to the lower. Both electrodes
are connected to the welding transformer
secondary, an integral part of the fixture.
The final type gun is the bar or lever
gun. This one is always used in con-
junction with a fixture. The work is po-
sitioned on the stationary electrode. This,
in turn, is connected to the transformer
secondary. The other side of the second-
ary is connected to a copper bar encircling
the work. The gun is inserted under the
outer electrode and the point is posi-
tioned on the work proper. After apply-
ing pressure, the welding cycle is ini-
tiated by pressing the switch on the gun
connected to the welding contactor.
Welding presses, a fairly recent inno-
vation, have permitted progress towards
automatic welding lines. Large subas-
semblies such as floor panels, doors and
trunk lids, that require a number of
welds are. jigged and handled by auto-
matic welding machines which make up
to 250 spot welds at a time.
These welding presses have proven
themselves more economical than con-
ventional welding methods. Because of
the better quality of welds produced,
metal finishing to remove blemishes has
become unnecessary. In one plant, to
maintain a supply of doors for 300 cars a
day, 54 operators and 9320 square feet
of floor space were required. However,
with press welding, the same plant pro-
duces 300 car doors an hour using 24
operators and 3640 square feet of floor
space.
A welding press is merely a means of
fixing the work and then welding it. It
consists of a fabricated steel crown sup-
ported on four hollow pillars. The bottom
of the press is a table that moves verti-
cally along the pillars which have ma-
chined faces on them to form ways for

INDUSTRIAL
PROGRAM
A glimpse of the research being conducted at
the University of Michigan and how industry
and the University both benefit from the Col-
lege of Engineering's Industrial Program.
By MIKE KRAFT, LS.A/59
Linking industry and the University
of Michigan with a two way flow of in-
formation, the College of Engineering's
Industrial Program successfully meets
the mutual needs of both industry and
engineering education. Through this pro-
gram, the University funnels non-confi-
dential research data to industry and in
return, the engineering college benefits
from increased contact with industrial
projects and personnel.
Now in its second year, the program
includes 17 subscribers, among them
such industrial leaders as American Mo-
tors, Chrysler, Ex-Cell-O, Ford, Dow
Chemical and General Motors.
Direct channels of communication be-
tween these industrial firms and Univer-
sity personnel engaged in research are
maintained by the Industrial Program
whose primary purpose is the exchange
of ideas and technological information
with industry. The engineering school
looks at the program partly as a teaching
tool for instructors and students who
gain an insight into various industrial
problems. Also, with subscribers' repre-
sentatives visiting the campus for general
talks, the school gains a knowledge of
possible avenues of research activity and
can begin investigating potentially im-
portant areas.
This close association of the college
staff with the modern requirements of
industry enriches both the educational
and research functions of the university.
This helps to provide more highly quali-
fied graduating engineers and expansion
of research activities into needed fields.
Furthermore, industry can utilize a
vast storehouse of research data, tech-
niques and results which sometimes travel
no farther than a professor's filing cabi-
net or perhaps publication in an engineer-
ing journal. By means of the program,
this material developed at the University
reaches industry through:
• Summaries of current research and
development activities.
• Pre-prints of research papers, and
copies of technical reports, bulletins, cir-
culars, and other data.
• Technical meetings for the discus-
sion of specific topics.
• Symposia for presentation of recent
scientific and engineering advances as
well as investigation in progress.
The major efforts of the program staff,
which is under the administration of
Harold A. Ohlgren, Professor of Chemi-
cal Engineering and Assistant Director of
the Engineering Research Institute, are
directed towards collecting results of re-
search being conducted by ERI and the
College of Engineering for the subscrib-
er's summaries from some 30,000 to
10,000 pages of reports. The program's
feature of providing usable information
to such a subscriber with a minimum
amount of report reading is accomplish-
ed in two ways.
First, altough the subscriber is entitled
to any report released, the program staff
selects research reports, papers and theses
which appear to have the greatest indus-
trial application. Second, abstracts are
made of each release and mailed to the
subscribers for their review. From these
abstracts, the subscriber can readily select
those reports he finds of special interest.
Also, since research theses and papers
often are not published in journals until
a year or more after the work is com-
pleted, one of the program's most valu-
able features is advance distribution of
these technical papers. This provides the
subscriber with a considerable head star!
on new development in their field.
As another feature of the program,
meetings are held between representatives
of the subscriber and the University, tlws
providing closer communication and

INDUSTRIAL PROGRAM
(Continued from page 22)
tain data that they are unable to obtain
themselves, while large industries are
kept informed of work in regions that
they are especially interested in or have
not had time to explore fully.
Industry does not dictate what re-
search the University is to undertake, nor
is the program a counseling service for
handling industrial problems. However,
the services of the Engineering Research
Institute are usually available for a spon-
sored research project.
The program operates directly through
a representative of the subscriber and a
member of the faculty of research staff
who generally is in the academic field
related to the subscriber's industrial activi-
ties. Meetings are periodically held at
campus or at the subscriber's location
where the representatives discuss new
findings in their fields of mutual interest.
Recent program releases of interest to the
subscriber are reviewed in detail and the
subscriber has the opportunity to talk
with the individual working directly on
the research itself.
In addition to these meetings between
representatives, a series of group meetings
and symposia are scheduled at campus
for the subscribers. Included in the sym-
posia are speaker presentations and panel
discussions on a variety of current scien-
tific topics.
It is these features of the Industrial
Program that enable the University and
industry to exchange ideas and informa-
tion for their mutual benefit.
LIQUID FUEL DROPS
Among the research subjects conducted
at the University and described by the In-
dustry program was an investigation into
the generation and rate of burning of
uniform liquid fuel drops in the range of
sizes used in air craft gas turbine com-
bustors. The work was done by Jay A.
Bolt, Thomas Boyle, and William Mirsky
and described in their report, The Gen-
eration and Burning of Uniform-Size
Liquid Fuel Drops.
Methods were developed for produc-
ing, burning, and observing both groups
of fuel drops and single fuel drops.
Groups of fuel drops were produced
by using a type of spinning-disk sprayer
held in the collet chuck of an air turbine.
The fuel was ignited by holding the
flame of a Bunsen burner in the region
through which the drops were moving.
A technique was developed for photo-
graphing the burning drops under two
conditions: one, when the drops were
supplied with room-temperature air; the
other, when they were supplied with heat-
ed air. Observations of drops in the size
range from 50 to 130 microns revealed
that, during burning, a linear relationship
exists between the square of the diam-
eter and time; likewise, the burning lilt
of a drop is proportional to the square
of its initial diameter. The rate of change
of volume, or rate of burning, is there-
fore proportional to the first power of the
diameter. Further conclusions showed that
heating of the combustion air did not
produce a significant change in the burn-
ing rate of drops, and that the uniformity
of the drop diameter of a spray diminishes
rapidly as burning proceeds.
Single burning drops were produced
by suspended-drop and falling-drop tech-
niques. In the suspended-drop technique,
a drop was stabilized in space by means
of air drag forces and ultrasonic waves;
in the falling-drop technique, a vertical
furnace was used to study a single burn-
ing droplets as it fell from a micro-
dropper through the heated furnace at-
mosphere.
Although only preliminary results have
been obtained in using the suspended-
drop technique, it is hoped that the ap-
paratus for suspending both liquid drops
and small solid particles will prove to be
a new useful tool for research on the com-
bustions of all types of fuels, both liquid
and solid, and that it may also be applied
in other fields of investigation.

By F. E. Goodman, Vice-President
of General Motors.
General Manager of
Fit her Bod) Division
When a small boy takes it into his
head to make something—a boat, an air-
plane, a model car—he gives little
thought to method. If he wants it enough,
his urge to have the thing for his own
pleasure knows no barriers. He just goes
ahead and makes it, devising methods as
he goes along.
The product of his efforts may be crude
indeed—but the process is a thing of
inestimable value.
For those fumbling improvisations of
the child are the first stirrings of a great
potential. They are the results of tension,
in a budding personality, between the
will to do and the want of skill the
desire to have and the lack of means.
This is the dynamics of ingenuity.
If the small craftsman perseveres, he
soon finds that his most useful tool is his
untrammeled imagination. He discovers,
too, that the more he tries, the more facile
becomes the hands and the mind with
which he works. He has stumbled upon
the formula that every industrial man-
agement in the world today is striving
to use
That is the great significance of a boy
at work.
It is vitally important that young crafts-
men should persevere—for they have in
them the makings of a greater tomorrow
—for industry ,for America, for mankind.
The key to the preservation of this
priceless asset of the nation is the realiza-
tion that ingenuity is a growth that has
deep roots—roots that take hold in child-
hood. It must be cultivated in childhood
and nurtured through adolescence, if it
is to mature in the man.
There is no short cut to ingenuity. It
has either grown through the formative
years—or a man has let it wither and
perhaps even die. Look through the
courses offered by our universities and
our great technical colleges. You will not
find listed a formal course in Ingenuity
—but professors have the opportunity to
encourage its growth in many courses.
Whether encouraged or not, ingenuity-
is one of our critical national resources.
It is the ingredient that transforms engi-
neering into a creative function—that
advances technology into unexplored
areas—that opens new doors for the
industrial designer—that puts new magic
into mass-production processes.
We could not build the complex, ad-
vanced-style automobile bodies of today
with the tools of yesterday. It took not
only highly trained men, but men of rest-
less imagination and endless resourceful-
ness to devise the high-speed, precision
tooling we are now using.
Basically, ingenuity is a attitude of
mind, an angle of approach to new prob-
lems. It can be cultivated in young minds,
free of standardized ideas. Engineering
students can cultivate it well under the
guidance and stimulation of professors
who view students as more important
than courses.
This has been demonstrated in youth
programs sponsored by industry—such
as the Fisher Body Craftsman's Guild
model car competition—in which boys
design some of their own tools out of
odds and ends, make scholarship-win-
ning model cars out of old materials and
use common pins to make realistic wire
wheels.
Every normal boy has in him the
seeds of ingenuity. This great national
resource should be cultivated assiduously.

Welding is performed perpendicularly,
or as close as possible, to the vertical. For
work perpendicular to the table, pinchcr
guns are used. The spot welding techni-
ques have previously been described.
The cycle of the press is as follows:
(1) Depression of the button energizes
the control circuit and the table with the

has reached the correct position, hydraulic
controls are actuated and pressure is ap-
plied to the guns. (3) Immediately the
pressure is established, the timer fires the
contactors in progressive sequence. (4)
When the last contactor has been fired,
hydraulic controls release the pressure
from the guns and the electrodes are re-
tracted. (5) The table is lowered and the
work is removed.
These various technological advances,
along with proper utilization of gas weld-
ing, arc welding, butt, seam, flash and
spot welding have enabled automobile

Ever get the wanderlust? . . . Guess we
all do; chained to the slipstick habit as
we are, most of us have to limit our ex-
cursions to pipe-dreaming—or, if we try
to put a practical face to it, to "planning."
Spring brings on the wanderlust in epi-
demic proportions, and spring is just
around the corner . . . though not very
noticeably, if you're talking about the
corner by the Arch; an icy blast seems to
make that place its year-round home. Any-
how, let's turn our attention to some
problematical journeying:
Journeying, (ahem) in the history of
mankind, began on foot . . . and so did
A and B. These two friends set out from
the same place at the same time in the
same direction. A walked at a uniform
rate of 18 miles a day and after nine days
turned back and walked as far in the
opposite direction as B had walked in
the 9 days. A then turned around once
more and overtook B exactly 22Y2 days
from the time they first set out. What is
B's rate of speed, assuming it to be uni-
form?
Quickly coming up to present and more-
convenient methods of transportation . . .
What you are about to read is a true
story, only the student's name has been
changed to protect the anything-but-in-
nocent. A fortunate friend of ours, we'll
call him Rufus T. Flypaper, leaves his
house every morning by car for the two-
mile drive to school. Being a very precise
individual, he knows that he must aver-
age 30 mph to arrive on time. One in-
famous morning a woman driver so im-
peded Rufe's progress for the first mile
that his average was only 15 mph for
that mile. He quickly calculated the prop-
er speed for the remainder of his trip so
that his punctual record would be un-
broken. Neglecting the possibilities of a
lurking Swoverland and accounting for
the possibilities of a modern auto, do you
think Rufe could reasonably expect to be
on time?
In Chicago the elevated train runs from
Racine to Howard in 45 minutes. (OK,
so we don't remember anything about the
lovely city; grade school arithmetic prob-
lems still talk about butter at 8 cents a
pound.) For the duration of this prob-
lem, we will consider them to be run
by automation, so that schedules are ex-
act. A train leaves Howard Street every
five minutes for Racine, and each time a
train leaves Howard another one leaves
Racine for Howard. You are on one of
the trains leaving Racine and are going
all the way to Howard. Not counting the
trains at the two terminals, how many
trains will you sec going in the opposite
direction?
For those of you who like to travel but
don't care whether you get anywhere,
how about a sailing problem? A novice
sailor was using rocks as ballast to coun-
teract his inexperienced sailboat handling.
When he finally felt convinced that the
boat would not capsize, he threw the
rocks overboard. Assuming that the body
of water was conveniently small for this
problem, did the water level remain con-
stant, did it rise, or did it fall when the
rocks were dumped?
In general, an engineer is willing to
help a damsel in distress; this time it is an
Alice-thru-the-Looking-Glass on a four
square by four square checkerboard. The
rules of the game allow Alice to go into
any square actually bordering on the one
she is in, but prohibit her from walking
diagonally into a square through a corner.
Can you help her get from one corner to
the square on the opposite corner by en-
tering each square exactly once?
Last month we left a number-conscious
Romeo saying to his aging Juliet: "Let x
equal my age now and y equal the differ-
ence in our ages. Then x minus y equals
your age now. The resulting equations,
x = 2(x —y) and x + (x 4- y) — 63.
can be solved simultaneously. I am 28;
you are 21, so let's go down to the Bell."
The specific gravity of the cone is 0.58.
Specific gravity is equal to the volume be-
neath the water divided by the total vol-
ume of the floating object. These- volumes
are easily calculated using the given in-

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


John Young asks:
How does
research
differ from
development
work at Du Pont'
John E. Voung is working toward his U.S. in chemistry from Cali-
fornia Institute of Technology this June. He has maintained honor
standing in classwork while serving on the school newspaper, in the
debating society, and as treasurer of the student body. John is in-
terested in chemical research and development.
John Aaron answers:
Well, John, it's hard to define the difference in a way that
will satisfy everybody, because one always finds a lot of over-
lapping between research and development work. But most
people agree that there are differences, especially in time se-
quence. Research work comes first, because one of its main ob-
jectives is to establish or disc-over new scientific facts that will
supply the foundation for new industrial developments. In
other words, research men seek new knowledge about mat-
ter, generally working with small quantities of it.
Development work comes later, and Du Pout has two main
types. First, there is new process development. Here scientists
and engineers modify, streamline, and augment the findings
of research so that new chemical products can be profitably
made on a large scale—or existing products can be made by
newer and more efficient methods. Pilot-plant and semi-works
operations are usually included under this heading.
Second, an important kind of development work is directed
toward improvement of existing processes and products. Here
the men study how to obtain yield increases, utilize by-prod-
ucts, increase outputs, and solve sales service problems as they
arise. This may require considerable research, and that brings
us back to the overlapping I previously mentioned.
There are genuine differences, John, but a good deal of
similarity, too—especially in the constant need for imagination
and creative effort. I think you'll find that research and de-
velopment work are equally challenging and rewarding at
Du Pont.
John B. Aaron worked for Du Pont as a summer

INDUSTRIAL PROGRAM
(Continued from page 26)
CHEMICAL PLANT CONSTRUCTION
Of interest to the engineer involved in
the research, development, design, and
construction of chemical plants is the
manual prepared by H. A. Ohlgren, J. G.
Lewis, and Mark Weech.
This report is a manual of procedures
and specifications for the engineer in-
volved in the research, development, de-
sign, and plant operation of modifications,
new construction, and plant additions.
Their manual contains a comprehensive
description of the general conditions for
engineering construction in terms of con-
tractual obligations and engineering stand-
ards for both owner and contractor. A
method of preparing procedures in draw-
ing and specifications is described, and
specifications are presented for civil engi-
neering procedures in: site preparation
and grading, railroads, highways and
roads, grading for roads and railroads,
and piling. Specifications are also pre-
sented for structural procedures in: con-
crete work, building, exhaust systems, and
heating, ventilating, and air conditioning.
The procedures and specifications are
presented in some detail, and the manual
has been prepared so that the civil and
structural engineer can readily coordinate
the engineering aspects presented with
areas of engineering in mechanical equip-
ment, piping, electrical, and vessel design.
WELDING
Welding of Special Materials, is the
title of another manual distributed by the
Industrial Program. Prepared by H. A.
Ohlgren, J. G. Lewis, and R. J. Hennig,
this manual describes various welding
processes as applied to nickel, copper,
aluminum, titanium, stainless steels, stain-
less-clad steels, and carbon steels. It is
intended to serve as a reference manual
for those responsible for the control of
welding, especially in the welding of
materials other than carbon steels.
Specifications are presented covering
the general requirements for: the qualifi-
cation of welders and the responsibility of
the fabricator the qualification tests of
welders for the welding of carbon steel
shapes, plate, sheets, and pipe by Ace-
tylane and Arc processes; and the qualifi-
cation tests for the welding of high alloy
steel shapes, plate, sheets, and pipe by the
Arc, Heliarc, Sigma, and Acetylene proc-
esses. The welding procedures to be fol-
lowed in the shop and in the field are
specified for the welding of shapes,
plates, sheets, pipe and tube by the vari-
ous processes designated as appropriate
for carbon steel, stainless steel, nickel
and nickel alloys, "Durimet 20," illium,
copper and copper alloys, aluminum and
aluminum alloys, clad steels, and titan-
ium and titanium alloys. Specifications
are also presented covering quality con-
trol on the welding of carbon steel
shapes, plate, sheets, and pipe by the
Acetylene and Arc processes, and on the
welding of high alloy steel shapes, plate,
sheets, and pipe by the Arc, Heliarc,
Sigma, and Acetylene processes. Some
safety precautions applicable to the work
described are specified, and miscellaneous
items are also specified, such as: sample
forms, sketches of welder's tests, and
tables of general welding procedure.
METALLURGY
Another Industrial Program service to
subscribers are literature surveys. Of value
to technical personnel interested in the
research, developmental, or operational
phase of high-temperature metallurgical
processes is the literature survey prepared
by J. G. Lewis, R. J. Annesser, R. J.
Hennig and Marx Weech.
The report presents a survey of litera-
ture published after World War II relat-
ing to high-temperature metallurgical re-
fining processes and techniques. The
processes reviewed are grouped in seven
general categories according to the mech-
anism by which refining or separation is
accomplished. The categories selected are:
slagging and fluxing reactions; gas-solids
reactions; zone refining; electrochemical
refining in a high-temperature electrolyte
bath; metallothermic reactions; liquation-
segregation and liquid extraction proc-
esses; and vaporization, condensation,
and vacuum operations. A complete-
bibliography of papers read, a supple-
mentary reference list, and a list of pat-
ents are included.
A brief discussion is presented of proc
ess selection criteria, such as: melting
points and volatilities, thermodynamic
data, and alloy phase diagrams.
A statement of the authors' impres-
sions of the current status and potentiali-
ties of each process is summarized, and
the bibliography contains several refer-
ences to literature of a textbook nature
that should be useful to persons interest-
ed in the metallurgical refining field in
general.
GEAR WEAR
Radioactive methods were used by
Frank L. Schwartz, Robert H. Eaton, and
Ardath H. Emmons, to measure the rate
of gear wear at loads and speeds much
below critical conditions. By this method.
rate of wear can be measured continu-
ously; thus, loads and speeds can be
changed frequently, and wear rates can
be determined for a large number of
operating conditions in a short period of
time.
The radioactive method for determin-
ing wear rates in gears consists of acti-
vating a sample gear in a reactor, operat-
ing the radioactive gear under prescribed
loads and speeds, and then measuring,
by means of a detector-rate-meter record-
ing unit, the concentration of radioactive
particles of iron worn off from the gear.
The radioactive particles circulate in a
known quantity of oil in a closed system,
the oil containing a specific amount of
previously prepared, activated iron pow-
der. Although the intensity of radiation
from a given weight of iron decreases
logarithmically with time, a means wis
devised for correcting all intensity data
for proper timing. A continuous graph of
iron concentration versus time was made,
and the rate of wear was then deter-
mined from the slope of the curve.
An experimental sun gear for a final-
drive assembly, and specialized radioac-
tive-gear test equipment were used in
the tests. Results indicate that a radio-
active tracer technique is most effective
for gear-life and lubricant studies. Such
a technique is more economical and in-
formative than conventional gear-test
techniques.

The Very Idea!
Petroleum scientists and engineers have
a habit of coming up with the very idea to
solve a problem at the very moment it is
needed. They have created hundreds of
new products and have improved others,
putting the petroleum industry in the van
of American industrial progress.
The contributions of Standard Oil scien-
tists, working in extensive laboratories
and with the finest equipment, have been
outstanding. To give them even greater
opportunity to exchange and develop ideas,
Standard Oil uses the most modern tech-
niques for stimulating creative thinking.
Groups of our scientists now meet in
informal and relaxed creative sessions.
Through "brainstorming" and similar de-
vices, they contribute fresh, new thinking
to the solution of specific problems. These
men are creative by nature, and they
"pop" even more ideas, faster, at sessions
where one idea stimulates another.
In such an atmosphere of progress,
young scientists and engineers find great
opportunities to make positive contribu-
tions and build interesting careers.

In the Fourteenth Century there was a king who liked very-
much to hunt wild game. This selfish ruler wanted all the
wild game for himself, so he issued a proclamation that
made hunting a crime, punishable by death. The poor starving
peasants soon got tired of this set-up so they kicked the king
out of office. And so, this became the first instance on record
where the reign was called on account of game.

SLIDING DOWN THE WAYS at Groton. Conn., goes the USS Nautilus,
newest and fastest member of our underseas fleet. During welding,
Worthington heavy-duty turning rolls rotated the hull sections.
How the world's first atomic sub was welded
Welding the hull of the USS Nautilus, world's first
atomic submarine, presented a tough problem.
Submerged-arc automatic welding seemed to be ideal
for the job. Question was—could you rotate the hull
sections of the Nautilus to take advantage of this fast,
high-quality welding method?
Worthington's answer to General Dynamics Corpo-
ration's Electric Boat Division, builder of the Nautilus,
was the largest turning roll ever built.
The result? Welding of the Nautilus hull was accom-
plished in record-breaking time — and cost less than
originally estimated. Unchanged, the Worthington roll
set-up is also being used in the construction of the
nation's second atomic sub, the USS Sea Wolf.
Turning rolls for submarines aren't all that Worth-
ington makes. The long list of Worthington-designed,
Worthington-built equipment includes air conditioning
units, construction machinery, compressors, Diesel en-
gines, steam power equipment and, of course, pumps
of all kinds. For the complete story of how you can fit

A bunch of the boys were tossing them down
At the Old German last night.
They all agreed that life was hard;
Each one had his own sad plight.
They decided that each would air his woes
To see who would buy the beer;
A liberal arts man was first on his feet—
He began so that all could hear.
"Life was so sweet when my classes were split
But now they're all in a bunch.
Why, I go from eleven till one P.M.
With not even time for lunch,
My report's no better than thrce-point-four.
No matter how hard I have tried."
So they bought him a beer in sympathy,
And the engineer sat there and cried.
A bus-ad man was the next to rise;
What a sorrowful tale he did spin.
"I can't accomplish a thing in school,
At pinochle I never win;
A part time job interferes with my sleep."
And they knew he had not lied.
So they bought him a beer in sympathy,
And the engineer sat there and cried.
"My case is even sadder yet,"
Said a crew-necked Lit School man,
"I must turn in a book review
And comic books now are banned.
This college life is too rough for me,
I can't wait to get outside."
So they bought him a beer in sympathy,
And the engineer sat there and cried.
Looking around to the engineer
They gave him a chance to unbend.
"You've heard the woes of the college Joes,
Let's hear from you now, my friend."
Slowly, deliberately, he got to his feet,
And leaning on his old slide rule,
He began to give them the real lowdown
On life in engine school.
He spoke of days at a drafting board,
Of weeks on one lab report;
He told of Saturday classes,
But they made him cut it short.
"Stop; say no more, we beg of you;
Your life is the roughest," they sighed.
So they set him up a quarter keg,
And they all sat down and cried.

The Importance of
Cable Engineering and Design
Cable engineering is concerned with the
design and use of wires and cables to
direct the flow of electrical energy from
its source to the point of utilization. It
is generally more economical to gener-
ate electric power in relatively large
blocks at strategically located power
plants and to transmit it over relatively
long distances than to generate in small
quantities where it is used.
There are, therefore, two general types
of wires and cables used in the electri-
cal industry:
(a) those used for power transmission,
usually at voltages above 22 kilovolts,
(b) those used for power distribution at
lower voltages.
Cables used for power transmission are
generally single conductors with no
insulation. They are supported on in-
sulators above ground at such separa-
tions or spacings that the air provides
the required insulation. For power
distribution, on the other hand, where
the space occupied by the power line
is important, insulated cables are used.
This discussion deals with the design
and use of insulated wires and cables
for power distribution systems.
Insulated distribution cables carry
power from the transformer stations
along the transmission lines to its point
of ultimate utilization. The voltages at
which power is distributed vary from
about 15 kilovolts to 115 volts used in
individual homes. The higher voltages
are used for the distribution of rela-
tively large amounts of power from the
transformer stations to substations
nearer the points of utilization, such as
industrial plants, where it is trans-
formed to low or utilization voltages,
cither alternating or direct current.
Large quantities of electric power arc
distributed in this way and the value
of the distribution equipment required
is great. The value of the insulated
conductors, including those for both
portable or stationary installations,
probably exceeds that of any other
single item used in power distribution.
The design and operation of insulated
conductors and distribution systems are
of great public and commercial im-
portance. The primary function of
insulated cable engineering and design
is to provide safe, adequate, reliable
and pleasant appearing distribution sys-
tems. Electric power is so extensively
used in modern life that interruptions
to it are serious. The failure of elec-
trical power in an industrial plant
throws people out of work and reduces
production.
The appearance or sightliness of cables
installed overhead in a community is
important and is attained chiefly by
installing such cables with a small and
uniform sag from pole to pole.
Watch for the appearance of advertisements in this series In a
forthcoming issue. Reprints of this advertisement and subsequent
ones, relating to the uses of insulated wire and cable, will be sent
on request without obligation.

esting application is in the field of geo-
chronology. When a plant or animal
dies, the MC continues to decay, but is not

ide ceases. The ratio of ,4C to
therefore decreases and by measur-
ing this decrease, an important clue to
the age of the specimen is provided.
Many Problems Yet to be Solved
The depth and breadth of industrial
application of nuclear is astounding. Cer-
tainly the field is much more widespread
than meets the average eye. The tremend-
ous amount of development during the
last ten years is slowly bringing the
United tates and other nations into the
atomic age. However, this development
only indicates how much more is to be
accomplished—that we are only on the
edge of this bright new era.
Engineering, chemistry, and metallurgy
have many problems to solve and
phenomena to explain before man can
completely control the atom. For instance,
the heat generation possible in a reactor
has caused difficult problems, with which
these technicians have not been acquaint-
ed until this time. The thermodynami-
cally efficient transfer of heat at high
temperatures is well known to the engi-
neer, but the problem in nuclear reactors
is to remove tremendous amounts of heat
from small volumes. He is faced with the
new problems of remote control of the
radioactive substances, the shielding for
protection against the leathal gamma rays,
and lubrication and repair of broken
equipment in the high radioactive areas.
These problems, and many more, will
continually harrass the nuclear engineer.
Our knowledge of nuclear energy and
its possible applications to industry thus
compares to a remark once made in an-
other connection by Bertrand Russell,
who said, "We know very little, and yet
is astonishing that so little knowledge can
give us so much power."

At no time in the history of highway
transportation has there been such wide-

and mounting public demand tor ' new
roads makes it practically certain that
funds will be made available for high-
way construction in the next few
amounts thai exceed anything ever

dreamers of the past. The pressure beinj
built up back of this demand, incre
by the unavoidable delays connecte

Sylvania has introduced a new multi-
purpose lamp, using as a power source
conventional radio waves. The lamp
transforms radio impulses into light more-
brilliant than any other incandescent lamp
ever devised and is known as the RF
(Radio frequency) lamp.
The light-producing energy is the same
as that used in TV and radio broadcast-
ing, and is carried to the RF lamp by
means of a copper coil wound around the
outside of the lamp from a radio fre-
quency oscillator. An indirect DC voltage-
source, not directly connected to the lamp,
is used, and the radio energy is focused
on a disc about 5/16 in. in diameter,
causing it to incandese brilliantly; this
brilliance can be controlled by varying
the voltage. A water line can be con-
nected to the oscillator to cool the lamp
and coil.
Because the refractory material used in
the small disc can be heated to a much
higher temperature than the tungsten fila-
ments of incandescent lamps, a great in-
crease in light is attained. Also, because-
of the higher temperature, the light has a
higher content of blue than does the in-
candescent lamp and provides more light
emission in the visible range. With the
use of a disc, as contrasted with the usual
tungsten wire filament, the light from the
lamp can be focused directly without
complicated optics.
The lamp has numerous applications,
most apparent of which lie in the movie
industry, with whose cooperation the lamp
was designed. It also has uses in radar
and air traffic control, medical research,
color TV tube processing, film projectors,
and many other fields.
Immediate advantage of these charac-
teristics of the RF lamp is being taken
by the motion picture industry which is
already using the lamp in film printing
operations. By using the RF lamp, the
motion picture industry now can increase
the speed of critical film printing opera-
tions up to eight times faster than it
could using conventional methods. The
speed with which Hollywood will now
print these films is limited by the me-
chanical speed at which the film can be
run through the printing equipment
rather than by the quantity of light avail-
able. In addition to these substantial sav-
ings in time in film printing, the uni-
formity of RF illumination has resulted in
a noticeable improvement in the quality
of the print.
Sylvania engineers are now also work-
ing on the possibility of employing the
RF lamp for studio set lighting. With the
advent of wide-screen color motion pic-
tures, many times more light is needed in
filming to gain the necessary depth of
focus. In supplying this quantity of light
the temperature on the studio set fre-
quently rises to a point at which it be-
comes a problem to both actors and
technicians. The RF lamp conducts out the
heat which other lamps transfer into the
air.
The RF lamp also permits radar im-

of the planes' position is an important

The design of modern communications equipment
involves much more than electronic circuit tech-
niques. Keyboards and coders are often required
to translate the intelligence to be transmitted into
"machine language!' Recording and reproducing
devices store intelligence until the equipment is
ready to transmit it, or hold received intelligence
until it can be translated back into human language
by a printer or other output display device.
The combination of such mechanical and electro-
mechanical techniques with the better known but
still developing techniques of electronic circuit
design makes of modern communications a much
broader field than is commonly recognized. When
such technical tools are used to provide equipment
tailored to our rapidly improving understanding of
propagation phenomena and information theory,
the resulting practical improvements in communi-
cation are sometimes little short of spectacular.
The growing communications activities of The Ramo-
Wooldridge Corporation have generated requirements
for additional physicists and engineers with substan-
tial experience in research,development,or production

WHAT'S THE TREND
IN PRODUCT
DESIGN?
It affects your future
as a development engineer
INDUSTRY'S forecasts predict con-
stantly growing competition for cus-
tomers. As a result, tomorrow's designs
will be based on two major premises:
dependability and cost.
With rising costs of materials and
labor, industry is searching for ingen-
ious engineers to show them how to
develop and manufacture their prod-
ucts at a profit. . . and still keep selling
prices down.
The engineer who knows how to use
materials like welded steel to eliminate
unnecessary cost will command key
positions in industry. Welding holds
the answer to many design dilemmas
where costs must be cut and products
made stronger, more rugged.
The example shows how one machine
component has been made more dur-
able.. . yet the cost was cut from 850 to
65(f a piece. Because of steel's higher
strength, greater rigidity and lower
costs, similar reductions in cost are pos-
sible in virtually all products now made
from gray iron.
Latest design ideas in changing over
parts from gray iron to steel are avail-
able to engineering students by writing

being subjected to loadings which are
many times the magnitude of highway
loads, although the volume of traffic and
the load repetitions fall far below those
of highway traffic.
History and Construction
In 1946 the University of Michigan
took title to the Willow Run Airport as
war surplus. The primary objective in so
doing was to acquire these unusual facili-
ties for research. The subsequent use of
the property was mainly in aeronautics
but a number of other departments and
colleges have had occasion to utilize facil-
ities at the field and the extensive re-
search program which resulted has cer-
tainly justified the undertaking on the
part of the University.
Concurrently with its acquisition ar-
rangements were made to lease the field
to a group of the larger commercial air-
lines serving Detroit. The operation and
maintenance of the airport as a terminal
facility was subsequently placed in the
hands of the Airlines National Terminal
Service Company, Inc., (ANTSCO), and
has so remained up to the present time.
During the construction period, there
are several matters of importance to a
general review. Soil conditions in the area
were close to ideal for airport construc-
tion. The entire field area is on an out-
wash plain formed by the delta of the
Huron River flowing into a post-glacial
lake, the shores of which were near
Yysilanti. The sand and gravel varies
from a few feet to as much as 30 or 4()
feet in depth over the lake bed day. The
water table did vary from fairly close to
the surface in the north and northeast
part of the field to the very deep in the
southwest. Subdrainage installed serves
to keep the water table generally beyond
the depth of frost penetration that would
affect the paving.
Mistaken and unnecessary emphasis on
speed in construction of the runways left
some things undone which would have
been very serious under less excellent soil
conditions. In this connection, failure to
work out an adequate grading plan, fail-
ure to remove topsoil and organic matter
and failure to provide adequate surface
drainage were the important oversights.
At the request of the contractors who
insisted upon a complete investigation
for their own protection, a complete sur
vey was made of these difficulties. Insofar
as was then practicable, these conditions
were corrected but not without some com-
promise. The ultimate result was that in
some areas, subgrades were weakened,
and surface drainage existed at sites
where nearly perfect airfield pavement
was quite possible.
Attention is first directed to the fact
that the pavement at Willow Run was
built in three stages. The original field
was built in 1941 and includes the major
portion of the main runways and the so-
called factory apron at the west end oi
the field in front of Hangar No. 1, the
present terminal building. This pavement
was unreinforced concrete with 8-6-8
thickened edge section. In 1942 the ex-
tensions at the east end of the field were
built under the supervision of the U. S.
Engineer Department. The 1942 con-
struction includes the extension of. both
East-West runways, 9-27, the southerit
Northeast-Southwest diagonal runway.
4R-22L, and the East apron with short
connecting taxiways. This was also un-
reinforced concrete pavement but was
somewhat heavier, being 10-7-10 thicken-
ed edge section. In 1943 additional ex-
pansion was made under the Defense
Plant Corporation which included en-
larging the main apron at the west end of
the field by sections now designated as
Aprons No. 1 and No. 2, the southerly
extension of the North-South runway,
18-36, and Apron No. 3 with connecting
taxiways. This pavement was again a
thickened edge section, 8-6-8, and was
also unreinforced.
It may also be noted that both the 194-
and 1943 construction was carried out
under adverse weather conditions near
the end of the season normally consider-
ed suitable for concrete curing and ab-
sence of frost damage. The decreasing
modulus of rupture in these successive
pavement projects and adverse weather
conditions may be taken as indications o!
sacrifices made in good construction prac-
tice or in enforcement of standard speci-
fications, which frequently occurs durim:
wartime emergenq'. There were also other
examples of poor construction practice
which, it is interesting to note, have ap-
parently had a more profound effect on

Advanced structures facilities speed
careers of Lockheed engineers
Engineers in Lockheed's Structures Division are supported by
unmatched research and testing facilities in their constant effort
to increase strength while decreasing weight.
Among those facilities are the Lockheed-designed 500,000 Lb.
Force Fatigue Machine, first of its size; Shimmy Tower, only
one in private industry; and Drop Test Tower, largest in the
nation.
Facilities such as these give engineers a major advantage in
making technical advances — and thus advancing their careers.
Moreover, the large number of projects always in motion at
Lockheed mean continuing opportunity for promotion as well
as job security.
Why Lockheed needs Engineers with Structures training:
1. "Foil-Safe" Structures — Lockheed has begun an extensive pioneer-
ing effort in the new concept of "fail-safe" structures. Studies are
being applied to virtually all phases of Lockheed's diversified devel-
opment program — already the largest in the company's history.
2. New studies in: Effect of high temperatures on structures; optimiza-
tion of thin-wing designs and other aero-elastic problems; new
materials such as ultra-high heat treat steel: panel instability at
extremely high speeds.

pavement performance, as will be point-
ed out later.
Pavement Performance under Full
Scale Operation
During the period since 1946 the oper-
ation and maintenance of the airfield by
ANTSCO for the University is covered
by the referenced correspondence dealing
with maintenance problems and periodic
surveys of pavement condition. Early
recognition of these problems and the
University's stewardship responsibilities
led to a program of annual inspections
and a long range inventory of the physi-
cal condition of the pavement. A major
part of this long range inventory has been
the aerial photographs taken to record
the cracking pattern of pavement that has
developed over the years. The first com-
plete set of photographs was taken in
1946 at the time when the airline opera-
tion was starting. The second was taken
in 1950 and the third in the summer of
1955.
The plan is to take a complete set of
aerial photographs every five years to
provide the basic record of the pavement
cracking pattern and to serve as the pri-
mary measure of pavement condition.
During these five year periods, supple-
mentary records are provided by the an-
nual maintenance and crack-filling pro-
gram and by the reports following an
annual inspection made by representa-
tives of the University and ANTSCO.
While these studies are regarded as a
research program, they must also be
recognized as a necessary part of the
maintenance and operation of Willow
Run Airport. The changing condition of
the pavement has compelled attention to
the fact that concrete pavement in heavy
service can scarcely be expected to last
indefinitely unless it can be maintained
to a sufficiently high standard which off-
sets both normal wear and tear and also
deficiencies in design.
In connection with the basic problems
of pavement design that are involved, no
pavement can be designed within prac-
ticable limits to bridge over a weak sup-
porting subgrade. The function of a pave-
ment is to provide a riding surface that
is resistant to the wear of abrasion of
traffic and disintegrating effects of cli-
mate, is of good riding quality, but ad-
ditionally protects the subgrade and pre-
serves its ability to support applied load.
With a few exceptions already noted, the
granular subgrade at Willow Run, when
confined by a pavement of adequate
structural continuity, has internal stabil-
ity far in excess of that needed to sup-
port any imaginable loads.
1950 Crack Survey
The first attempt at making a compre-
hensive study of the condition of the
pavement at Willow Run followed the
1950 aerial photographs. After they were
taken, and considering that there was
evidence of accelerated cracking in cer-
tain areas, an analysis was made of the
amount of cracking and the character of
this cracking. The problem was assigned
to Donald S. Hill, a graduate student in
airport construction. He made the analyse
under supervision and prepared a report
on it in the Spring Semester, 1951.
Cracks were classified into transverse,
longitudinal, diagonal, pattern cracking,
and failure or replacement. At this time,
quantitative evaluation was made in terms
of the percentage of slabs which had
cracked between the dates of the two sets
of photographs, 1946 and 1950. The
photographs also showed that the 1943
pavement stands apart in the high per-
centage of cracking in all categories.
There was also some evidence of a corre-
lation between increased cracking and
heavier load concentrations, as well as a
relationship to known subgrade weakness.
Methods of Evaluation of Pavement
Performance
A definite measure of structural con-
tinuity has been formulated in the course
of this study and represents an important
step in reducing the measure of pave-
ment adequacy to fairly precise quantita-
tive terms. There are two factors which
have been selected for this purpose; the
continuity ratio and the cracking index.
The Continuity Ratio, CR, is the ratio
of the average slab length of a pavement
divided by a selected standard length or
area representing normal subdivision of i
concrete pavement which does not sub-

The curricula of the Department of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering has been carefully planned
and refined during the years to thoroughly educate student engineers in the theory of modern ship design. Ex-
curricula activities are concerned with current professional practice such as visits to yards, contacts with
operators, designers and builders, and papers by the Quarterdeck Club. In addition the students are familiar-
ized with naval tank testing and other problems brought to the department by industry for solution and research.
The illustration above shows a model test in which ink probes and free flowing yarns disclosed bad
underwater flow on the Lakes tanker "Martha E. Allen" resulting in intolerable stern vibration. Based on this
research, flow control fins were installed in April, 1955 and last season's operation indicated a gain in speed
with elimination of vibration.

fined as the ratio of uncracked slab length

length or area expressed as a percentage
and subtracted from 100 per cent.
Conclusion
In closing this report it may be helpful
to summarize the more important results
of the survey of pavement performance
at Willow Run Airport and several re-
lated conclusions.
1. The application of a systematic an-
alyses of the cracking pattern to the
Willow Run paving in terms of a Con-
tinuity Ratio and a Cracking Index has
proved to be a most valuable technique
for measuring pavement performance in
definite quantitative terms. The proce-
dures developed make possible an accur-
ate record in whatever detail is required
from the continuity ratio or cracking in-
dex for the entire airport to any compon-
ent thereof down to an individual slab.
The result is an inventory of pavement
conditions which largely eliminates in-
(Continued from page 70)
tangible and uncertain factors which have
handicapped pavement evaluation.
2. The evidence produced indicates
that a well constructed pavement of only
six-inch center thickness, even though un-
reinforced, has been capable of carrying
without serious structural damage the
heavy wheel loads far in excess of those
for which the pavement had been de-
signed or subsequently rated under cur-
rent practice. However, this has been on
subgrades of high supporting capacity
generally available at Willow Run.
3. In limited areas where subgrade
weakness has been present the unrein-
forced slabs have cracked to the point of
becoming structurally inadequate and have
either been replaced or will require re-
placement or other major repair. Under
such conditions the loss of structural con-
formity strongly suggests that adequate-
steel reinforcement would have substan-
tially increased the useful life of the
pavement. Early observations of replaced
slabs that were reinforced supports this
conclusion.
4. In spite of all the attention which
has been and should be given to rational
pavement design with a logical correla-
tion of wheel loads, subgrade bearing
capacity and effective distribution of loads
by the pavement, the disappointing per-
formance of the 1943 pavement and the
sharp contrast with that built in 1941
shows that what may have been consid-
ered a relatively minor detail of con-
struction methods exerted the most pro-
found influence on pavement behavior.
Regardless of all other factors which play
their role in design and construction, it
must be said that the final result in term&gt;
of pavement performance demonstrates
that nothing takes the place of a good
job.
In effect, therefore, the research and
development done on pavements at Wil-
low Run Airport is another advance to-
ward a safer highway of tomorrow. So
long as such work continues, and so long
as such men as Professor William S.
Housel, (from whom all material of this
article was taken), continue to lead simi-
lar projects, the more will highways con-
tinue to progress.

speaks from experience when he says,
"AtU.S. Steel, the opportunities are unlimited.'
Bob Blake had his first experience in
steel mills working there during sum-
mer vacations from college. After re-
ceiving his B.S. degree in Electrical
Engineering, he became an operating
trainee in U.S. Steel's Irvin Works.
During his training program, his
background and versatility were used
by the Training Division to develop
a training program for Electrical
Maintenance employees. By the end
of 1951, Mr. Blake had become a
Foreman with experience in both
Cold Reduction Maintenance and
the Galvanizing Department.
Effort is made to have young engi-
neers obtain varied experience be-
fore devoting themselves to one field.
Mr. Blake feels that, "An engineer-
ing graduate has practically no ceil-
ing provided he has the right attitude
and is willing."
Promoted again in 1954, Mr. Blake
is now Foreman—Electric Shop in
Central Maintenance. Supervising a
crew of 40 men, he is responsible for
electrical construction work, mainte-
nance and crane wiring. Mr. Blake
feels he is in "an interesting and
challenging field of work." He has
found that "U.S. Steel is a highly de-
sirable employer in this most basic
of all industries."

L. S. &amp; A. STUDENTS JEALOUS?
The other day my roommate had a female guest
who is an LS&amp;A student. She sat there all afternoon
dividing her time between watching me work and
reading the Saturday Evening Post.
Later on she made the remark that "all engineers
are very narrow minded." Furthermore she said that
most of her girlfriends feel the same way.
So I mounted my soapbox and defended us engi-
neers. First I bought forth the large number of engi-
neers in all-campus activities and cited the fact that
the chairman of Joint Judiciary, a job requiring a very
broad viewpoint of life, has been an ENGINEER
for the last three semesters. Then I switched to sports,
enumerating all the engineers participating in both
varsity and intramural athletics. For instance three
first stringers from Michigan's world champion
hockey team are engineers.
On to the so called "arts" giving as an example a
friend who listens to more music and appreciates it
more than my music school roommate. Another engi-
neer hasn't missed any concert given in Ann Arbor
since he's been here. There arc many of us who take-
part each year in theatrical productions such as Gil-
bert &amp; Sullivan operattas. One of the popular Engi-
neering English Group II electives is Shakespeare.
Furthermore I mentioned the many engineers who
take electives such as History, Psychology and Politi-
cal Science.
All this while maintaining the intensive study
which will enable the engineer to further man's
technological progress giving man more free time to
devote to his family and his cultural development.
Technological progress which raises the standards of
living and allows practically anyone who so desires
to get a "broad" college education.
Our LS&amp;A coed was admittedly still unconvinced.
She thought that the majority of engineers did not
do these things and still needed to be exposed to them
even if it meant adding two years to the present \y2
to 5 year engineering course.
I agreed that perhaps many of the engineers do
not have as broad a concept of life as might be
desired but maintained that it was no fault peculiar to
engineers but one peculiar to our present environ-
ment. This I backed by the fact that most LS&amp;A stu-
dents do not seem to have a real interest in the so
called broadening courses they are taking.
Admitting this to be probably true our coed was
starting to come around to our side and probably
by the end of the semester we'll have those false
ideas out of her head.
This whole attack on "narrowminded" engineers
seems to come almost entirely from Liberal Arts
majors. All I've heard from students majoring in
courses which present a real challenge to the stu-
dent's mind like medicine, law and physics has been
respect for the challenge presented to and met by the
engineering student.
The answer seems to be that the SMALL mind
of the average Liberal Arts major which can do noth-
ing else but spread itself very shallowly over a wide
area is jealous of the keen mind which can delve-
intensively into one area and also spread extensively
over many areas.
Okay you bums the next time that cute little coed
leans across the table and whispers "engineers are
narrow minded" give her hell.
ENGINEERS WEEKEND
I have it on good authority (the chairman of the
Engineers weekend committee) that all engineers
who don't attend all the events planned for the
weekend of May 10-12 are missing out on a good
thing. First of all the committee stole the show from
the Honors Convocation and are having Dr. Stein-
man, chief engineer of the Mackinac Bridge Project
as the main speaker at the Thursday night Engineers
Club meeting. Dr. Steinman will also be the main
speaker at the convocation the next day. If you've
read the article "Across The Straits" in the February
Technic you know what a tremendous and contro-
versial enterprise the Bridge is. Dr. Steinman himself
is supposed to have a very unique personality so
don't miss him.
Next on the calendar is the annual Slide Rule
Ball which this year will be called "Spring Constant."
Rumor has it that the traditional rivalry with the
lawyers will be revived this year so perhaps it would
be best to leave best suits at home.
Therefore look for fireworks this year besides
dancing to the smooth music of Don Kenney's band,
a campus favorite. Intermission entertainment and a
few other surprises are promised by dance commit-
tee members.
Saturday picnics are planned for the freshman
and senior classes. I wouldn't be surprised if some
special refreshment just happened to appear.
It is hoped that the faculty will cooperate by not
scheduling any blue-books for May 11th, 14th and
15tn- —Sheldon Levin

CALLED EARTH
By JANET GUTHRIE '59A.E.
Within the International Geophysical Year the scient-
ists of forty nations will launch the greatest expedition
ever into the mysteries of the planet called earth.

neers from the University
Department of Aeronautical
Engineering.
The study of geophysics is the study of
the earth, and of its most hidden and in-
accessible parts. One year from this July,
man will start the most comprehensive
examination of his environment ever
undertaken, in the period of time known
as the International Geophysical Year. He
will explore the heights of the atmos-
phere, the depths of the ocean, the remote
areas of the poles. He will look for new
ways of relating the facts of earth's be-
havior one to the other, and will
use the relationships as the basis for
further investigation. With the best ap-
paratus his mind has devised, he will
measure and test and probe and study, in
the hope of greater understanding of his
planet and its workings.
The idea of a world-wide scientific re-
search program is not new. The first one-
was undertaken in the year 1882-83,
when scientists from most of the major
nations set up posts in the Arctic and
elsewhere, to gather data that might throw
new light on some of the mysteries of
geophysics. This first Polar Year, as it
was called, was highly successful in its
study of the earth's magnetism, as well as
in other areas. Firty years later, the second
Polar Year offered great advances in
man's knowledge of the ionosphere. Ra-
dio communication improved, and the
development of radar was materially aid-
ed. Now, after only twenty-five years,
new instruments and mechanisms are such
that another program is to be instituted,
encompassing ten areas of study and
reaching from the earth's core to a point
beyond 99-99 per cent of its atmosphere.
So far, more than forty nations have
indicated their willingness to participate,
including at least five from behind the
Iron Curtain. Each country is to plan
and execute its own program, under the
guidance of the Comite Special de l'Annee
Geophysique International. In the United
States, the governing body is the Na-
tional Academy of Sciences, through
which more than fifty institutions will
integrate their work. The three branches
of the Department of Defense will also
take part, and lend the support of their
resources wherever needed.
Among the areas of most intensive
study will be the ice-bound continent of
Antartica. Preliminary expeditions were
sent out late last year by the U. S., the
members of the British Commonwealth,
the U.S.S.R., and France, to establish
primary bases of operation. At least seven
other nations are expected to join in at-
tacking the continent's secrets. There will
be about thirty bases scattered over the
5,050,000 square miles of area. The
U.S.S.R. is expected to maintain a post
at the south magnetic pole, some eight
hundred miles from the geographic pole
where the United States will have a sta-
tion. The latter will hold, during IGY,

ANTARCTICA is a continent of about five million square miles, or nearly twice as
large as Australia. It lies almost wholly within the Antarctic Circle (latitude 66
degrees, 30 minutes). More than three million square miles of it remain unexplored.
On this map the unknown region is suggested by the open areas. The mountain
regions which have been surveyed to some extent are those closest to the coast.
They include peaks up to 15,000 feet, some of which are active volcanoes. Only
certain major areas are named on the map. Those bases, some old and others only
projected, which various nations have already designated for the international
Geophysical Year are marked on the map by symbols identified in the legend. The
proposed British route across the continent is traced, as is the voyage of the ATKA.

Plans for the International Geophysi-
cal year call for the establishment of
more than 20 scientific stations on or near
the Antarctic Continent. In accord with
the international program, the United
States plans to conduct scientific studies
in meteorology, glaciology, ionospheric
physics, geomagnetism, aurora and air
glow, cosmic rays, sesimology, and grav-
ity measurements from at least three sta-
tions in Antarctica.1
Antarctica holds the world's greatest
ice sheet and is a major hub of earth's
magnetic and meteorological activity. Its
lands, atmosphere, climate and physical
traits are still largely unknown; vast
areas of the Antarctic continent have
never even been seen by man. The Ant-
arctic therefore will receive special at-
tention during the IGY. At least 10
countries will man stations in the region:
the U.S., the U.S.S.R., Great Britain,
France, Norway, Australia, New Zealand,
Argentina, Chila and Japan. Two inter-
national conferences have already been
held—in Rome last year and in Paris this
summer—to allocate sites and coordinate
the plans. All told there will be six, of
which three will be major bases—at Little
America, in Marie Byrd Land and near
the South Pole.-
The main station to be established this
year will be located in the Little America
area from which parties will deport by
tractor trains in October, 1956 to set up
a station in Marie Byrd Land. The third
station will then be built at or near the
South geographic pole from materials
brought by air. Since most of supplies for
all three stations will be collected at the
main base during the next season, the ex-
pedition must consist of several ships
and planes.
Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd, USN
was designated by the Department of
Defense as officer-in-charge. Similarly
Capt. George Dufek, USN has been desig-
nated as acting Task Force Commander.1
Seven ships, an air squadron and a
special mobile construction battalion com-
prise the task force now operating in the
Antarctic region. Officers and men of the
Seabee battalion are responsible for con-
struction of permanent and temporary
bases. Every Seabee on the expedition
volunteered for the assignment.
In addition to supplying logistic sup-
port, the ship unit will conduct mapping
operations in the Antarctic. Also, special
projects will be conducted as requested
by agencies of the United States Gov-
ernment. The air contingent will con-
duct air mapping missions, carry on ice-
reconnaissance, and supply logistic sup-
port of the main base and two satellite
bases.1
Voyage of the Atka
The preliminary step of the United
State's part in IGY was completed as
early as November, 1955. A party of
U.S. scientists and Navy men voyaged to
Antarctic in a Navy icebreaker, the USS
Ataka, to survey possible sites for sta-
tions on the coast and to make some pre-
liminary scientific studies. The Atka, leav-
ing Wellington, New Zealand, on Janu-
ary 7, approached the Antarctic continent
on the Pacific side. When the ship arrived
at the continental ice shelf, it soon be-
came apparent that the coast had changed
drastically since U. S. Navy icebreakers
had last visited it in 1948.
At Little America temperature meas-
urements were made in the ice, cores
were taken, ice strata were studied and
samples of snow were melted and bottled
for analysis. Samples of the air also were
collected for measurement of its carbon
dioxide content. Twice each day balloons
were sent to stratospheric heights for
radiosonde recordings of temperature
and humidity. The upper winds were esti-
mated visually or by radar whenever there-
was an opportunity. At the surface hourly
readings were taken of temperature and
barometric pressure. Weather maps were
made and analyzed to gain experience in
Antarctic forcasting.
Besides its scientific work, the voyage
of the Atka was significant because it
represented the first major operational
step of the U. S. in the launching of our
portion of the IGY effort.''

METEOROLOGY
International relations have for many
years been of prime concern in meteor-
ology, both among individual meteorolo-
gists and among government weather ser-
vices. The reason is not hard to find. The
weather pays no attention to immigration
laws, tariff barriers, or Curtains, either
Iron or Bamboo. Each country of the
world imports, manufactures, and exports
weather on a continuous basis: there is a
constant flow of it. Weather forecasting
requires a knowledge of meteorological
conditions far away. For example, if a
cold air mass is advancing at 40 mph, in
24 hours it would move 960 miles. Thus
a forecast for a day ahead would require
weather observations a thousand miles
away and more. Modern methods of
short-range, medium-range, and long-
range forecasting make use of weather
data from the whole of the northern
hemisphere, and those of the southern
hemisphere are being used increasingly.
The invention of the electric telegraph
which permitted rapid transmission of
data over long distances led to meteorol-
ogy's first big stride forward about the
middle of the nineteenth century. Soon
after that international meetings of dele-
gates from official weather services were
held to standardize methods of measur-
ing, coding, transmitting, and plotting
weather data. So when the First Interna-
tional Polar Year of 1882-83 was or-
ganized a number of government meteor-
ological services were actively engaged in
the program. The Second International
Polar Year of 1932-33 saw a much wider
and more active participation.
Since that time it has become increas-
ingly apparent that additional data from
the polar regions were not enough:
weather information is also badly needed
from other areas, particularly from tropi-
cal and equatorial regions. Hence the In-
ternational Geophysical Year planned for
1957-58 is being organized on a global
basis.
The Meteorological Problems
The primary meteorological problem
which will be investigated in 1957-58
is the whole complex of global atmo-
spheric circulations which goes by the
name of the general circulation. There is
good evidence that these circulations are
intimately interrelated but the mechanism
of the interaction is not well understood.
There are many air currents to be studied,
both near the surface and at great
heights: the equatorial easterlies, the
westerlies of middle latitudes, the sub-
tropical anticyclones lying between these
two great currents, the polar easterlies,
the traveling cyclones and anticyclones of
middle latitudes, the tropical hurricanes
and typhoons, the polar-front jet streams,
and the subtropical jet streams.
The earth's atmosphere is a gigantic
heat engine, receiving its heat input from
the sun, converting part of this input into
energy in various forms, and rejecting the
remainder in the form of long-wave ra-
diation from the earth and atmosphere
which is lost to outer space. The energy
goes to maintain the kinetic energy of the
great air currents against the constant
frictional losses as the air moves over the

earth's surface. It also maintains or in-
creases the potential energy of the at-
mosphere and evaporates water from the
oceans.
The exact details of the operation of
the heat engine vary with the seasons.
Let us consider the northern hemisphere.
In the fall and winter the sun's position
relative to the earth is such that the
equatorial regions receive strong radia-
tion, the middle latitudes receive much
less, and the polar regions little or none

at all. On the other hand the variation of
heat loss from equator to pole by long-
wave terrestrial radiation is much less.
Thus there must be a large horizontal
transport of heat from equatorial to polar
regions if the former are not to become
continually warmer and the latter con-
tinually colder. The strong cyclonic and
anticyclonic circulations and north and
south excursions of warm and cold air
of the winter season are part of the mech-
anism by which the atmosphere transfers
this heat. In the spring and summer the
radiative heat gains and losses vary much
less with latitude, the horizontal heat
transport is much smaller, and weather
activity less in middle latitudes. The ac-
companying diagram shows the distribu-
tion with latitude of mean annual in-
coming (solar), mean annual outgoing
(terrestrial), and of net incoming radia-
tion. Note that the two curves intersect at
latitude 38rN. In addition to this meri-
dional heat flux, there are also poleward
fluxes of angular momentum and of water
vapor to be considered.
The big question which the Interna-
tional Geophysical Year may help to
solve is that of the precise mechanism of
the atmospheric heat engine. Where is
solar radiation absorbed, and how much?
From which layers is terrestrial radiation
lost, and how much? The cloud cover is
important in radiation studies. What is
its distribution? What are the precise-
characteristics of the air currents which
contribute to the poleward fluxes of heat,
angular momentum, and water vapor?
This last question brings up a number
of interesting points. For example, how
much of the flux in each category is due
to north and south excursions of air in a
more or less random manner, and how
much is due to organized air motions in
cellular patterns? The diagram on page 16
shows the cellular pattern postulated by
Palmen, with rising air at the equator,
subsiding air in the subtropical anti-
cyclones at latitudes 30°, and surface
currents with north and south compon-
ents. A middle latitude cell, the polar
front, the polar-front jet and subtropical
jet, and the polar and tropical tropopauses
are also shown. The tropopause is the
surface separating the troposphere below,
where most weather occurs, from the
stratosphere above. Do these cellular pat-
terns exist as shown, and if so, when?
If not, what is their form? What is the
function of each part?
The concerted international effort of
1957-58 will provide some of the an-
swers to these questions. With increased
knowledge of the basic workings of the
atmospheric heat engine, there will be
more accurate medium-range and long-
range weather forecasts, with their great

The Meteorological Measurements
In order to obtain the required meas-
urements, forty-six nations have so far
joined in the planning. The United States
is making a large contribution to the total
program as are such nations as Great
Britain, Canada, the U.S.S.R., Australia,
France, Norway, and Japan.
The measurements needed are as fol-
lows: pressure, temperature, humidity,
and wind direction and speed, both at the
surface and aloft; precipitation; sunshine,
solar radiation (direct and diffuse) on a
horizontal surface, sky brightness, and net
radiative heat flux; snow and ice cover;
visibility; cloud forms, heights, and ve-
locities; the total albedo of the earth;
total atmospheric ozone; and carbon
dioxide concentrations. Not all these
quantities will be measured at each sta-
tion.
Upper pressure, temperature, humidity,
and wind. Many of the upper air sound-
ings will be made by the apparatus known
as the rawinsonde. Pressure, temperature,
and humidity are measured by light in-
struments attached to a rapidly rising free
balloon and the results radioed automati-
cally to a ground receiving station. The
position of the balloon is found at regu-
lar intervals by radar tracking of a tar-
get attached to it (see photographs);
from these measurements the wind direc-
tion and speed up to great heights will
be found. Special efforts will be made
to obtain data up to 100,000 feet. Not
all stations will have apparatus for radar
wind finding.
The upper air observations will be
concentrated along certain meridians of
longitude and parallels of latitude. The
meridians chosen are those at 10°E, 30°E
(from 30°N to 30°S), 75°E, 110°E,
140°E, 180°, 80°W, and 20°W. The
line of stations near 80° W extends
from Eureka at 80°N to the Antarctic
at 80°S. Several of the South Amer-
ican stations are near 70°W. These
strings of meridional stations will per-
mit studies of the poleward fluxes of
heat, angular momentum, and water va-
por mentioned earlier, and of the flow ot
air from the northern to the southern
hemisphere and vice versa. The parallels
of latitude are those at 5°S, the equator,
5°N, 15°N, 40°N in North America,
and one across the Andes. The last two
will allow studies of the influence of the
great mountain ranges on the general
circulation.
Radiation. The radiation program will
include measurements of solar and ter-
restrial radiation at the ground and aloft
where possible. Astronomical observa-
tories have been requested to measure the
mean albedo (reflectivity) of the earth by
Danjon's method of observing the earth-
light reflected from the moon. Such meas-
urements will give the total amount of
solar energy absorbed by the earth and its
atmosphere, and the day by day varia-
tions in this quantity. The radiation
studies are fundamental since it is solar
energy which drives the atmospheric heat
engine. (Continued on page 64)

Richard C. Shafer, B.S. in mechanical engineering at Lehigh,
was one of 16 engineers assigned to one of Western Electric's
toughest post-war projects — developing manufacturing tech-
niques for mass-producing (with great precision!) the tiny but
amazing transistors which are already causing a revolution in
electronics.
Paul J. Gebhard, B.S. M.E. at the University
of Maryland, was one of a team that helped
develop Western's new electroforming
process for coating steel telephone wire
with copper, lead and brass in one continu-
ous operation. His job: to develop conductor
resistance-annealing equipment and electro-
lyte filtration and circulating systems.
Bobby L. Pettit (at right), an E.E. from Texas
A. &amp; M., is one of several hundred members
of Western Electric's Field Engineering Force.
These F.E.F. men can be found all over the
world — working most closely with the Army,
Navy and Air Force —advising on the instal-
lation, operation and maintenance of com-
plex electronic equipment made by W.E.
^/estern Electric's primary job — which goes
'way back to 1882 — is to make good telephone
equipment that helps Bell telephone companies
provide good service. It's a very big job — and a
very important one — which calls for the pooling
of varied types of engineering skills.
New manufacturing processes and methods
are constantly required to produce better tele-
phones, better central office equipment, better
wires and cables, new types of electronic equip-
ment to keep pace with the nation's ever-growing
need for more and better telephone service at
low cost.
In addition to doing our job as manufacturing
unit of the Bell Telephone System, Western
Electric is busy producing many types of elec-
tronic equipment for the Armed Forces. Here
again, young engineers of varied training are
doing important work in connection with the
manufacture of radar fire control systems, guided
missile systems and special military communi-
cations systems.

fifteen scientists and skilled maintenance
men, who will make observations and
measurements of gravity and magnetism,
as well as weather. Other U.S. bases will
include one in Little America and a
logistics station at McMurdo Sound.
All over the continent, surface weather
observations will be recorded every three-
hours. Twice daily, balloons will be sent
to 100,000 feet to radio down reports on
temperature, pressure, and wind condi-
tions. These reports will be used with
others from around the globe to present a
true picture of atmospheric circulation.
Another major area of intensive con-
centration will be the atmosphere itself.
Probed by balloons and rockets, scruti-
nized by radar, the upper air should show
patterns only hinted at before. Among the
most complicated mazes to be untangled
is that of the huge currents high above
the earth's surface. Created by the tem-
perature differences resulting from the
sun's unequal heating, the currents mani-
fest themselves in the jet streams occa-
sionally ridden by aircraft and in whirls
and eddies which form the meteorologist's
"high's" and "low's". These surface pres-
sure areas are the most cogent factors
determining our weather. It is estimated
that the force of the daily upper-air pres-
sure exchange across the 40 latitude is
equal to the explosion of four and one-
half million atomic bombs. The tremend-
ous currents resulting, if correctly inter-
preted, could furnish material for valu-
able long-range weather forecasts.
As a method of attacking the various
problems of the atmosphere, four main
chains of weather observatories have been
delineated. They are to lie along the lati-
tudes of 10° and 140° E, 100° W, and
70°-80° W; the former for South Amer-
ica, the latter for North America. Along
these lines will be launched the major
portion of the radiosonde balloons.
Rockets will collect data where balloons
cannot reach; rockets such as the twenty-
foot, twelve hundred pound Aerobee-Hi,
expected to attain an altitude of two hun-
dred miles. Beyond the rockets' range is
that of the satellites.
By 1957, several nations expect to
have operable MOUSE'S (Minimum Or-
bital Unmanned Satellites of Earth). All
countries will have access to the infor-
mation returned by these vehicles, which
will circle at distances of up to eight -hun-
dred miles. They will be able to detect
and measure ionospheric currents, high
altitude magnetic effects of the earths
field, cosmic rays, and other data not ob-
tainable from positions on the ground.
The upper atmospheric insight thus ob-
tained will be a matter of intense inter-
est. The composition of the ionosphere
and of those emanations of the sun and
space known as cosmic rays is currently
little understood. Certain it is that their
power is enormous; but what their
nature remains practically unknown.
Cosmic rays in particular possess atom-
splitting capabilities; comprehension of
their why's and wherefore's could well
lead to unimagined sources of energy.
The behavior of the cosmic rays indi-
cates that the sun acts on nuclear particles
as a giant cyclotron, accelerating them
to ray energies. These energies are
millions of times greater than those the
best man-made accelerators can now pro-
duce, and most of the basic discoveries of
the short-lived mesons and other such
particles have come from the study of the
ensuing radiations. During IGY, scientists
will study primarily the effect of the rays
on nature; but much more of their true-
character should be rendered clear.

The Art of
Walking on Water
Absolute Icnee action is necessary.
The Technic is proud to reveal this
frank, fearless discussion of the New-
Inn Theory of Consecutive Confussion.
For ages man has been under tht
misconception that he cannot walk or
water. In fact, he has even given up at-
tempting to do it—believing that tht
secret requirement of the phenomena is a
miracle. But now, you, too, can perforr
this functional feat.
Actually, the only obstacle to walking
on water is the superstitious hurruri
mind. Man doesn't think that he can do
it—so he can't. The first requirement
then, is to remove all mental barriers on
the subject. While doing this keep in
mind the fun and inexpense of hiking
across Lake Michigan to Milwaukee. You
will not only be exhiliratingly unique
but also freed from the boring proletarian
types of water travel.
There arc two inherent assets of con-
quering water walking that will be in-
dispensable to your progress. First, it is
highly recommended that you have a
buoyant personality—for quite obvious
reasons. However, don't fret if you are
not buoyant now—study salesmen close-
ly for thirty days and you cannot escape
buoyancy. Second, you will have a defi-
nite advantage if your feet are flat. Those
people with exceptionally high arches will
find a great deal of difficulty in water
walking and will very likely have to give
up their pursuit.
Now, to the actual practice of water
walking—keep your feet as stretched and
stiff as possible, allow no flexibility in
the ankles, for all movement is derived
from the knees. Also, spread your toes as
far apart as possible. Simply begin walk-
ing as you normally do but hinge a/I
movement from the knees. Your feet
should by no means be more than three
feet apart at any time—any distance
greater than three feet will throw the
body off balance. This new walking
method will be tiring at first but diligent
practice will bring unrequited success.
Initiate your training on a small body
of water, preferable a placid pond, for
waves of any height will be a definite
detriment. Do not attempt the ocean
first—it is only for professionals.
Everyone, excepting those with arches,
can walk on water and thereby achieve
ultimate degrees of self-satisfaction, save
money, and obtain much exercise. While
you are treking a safari across the Pacific
to some south sea isle, the monotony ol
the world will fall away and you will be
absorbed in unique functionality.
Remember: it's all in the knees, not in
the elbows.

How to make an exception prove a rule
Technological progress is rapid in the petro-
leum industry. Few processes have a chance to
"grow old" on the job. Most are killed off through
the combined efforts of thousands of scientists
working constantly to improve everything we do,
make or use in our business.
Every now and then, though, we experience a
happy exception to this rule. That occurs when a
new development not only meets the immediate
need but also provides the right answer to situa-
tions yet unforeseen.
Twenty-five years ago last August a process
known as "delayed coking" was invented. The
new process made a quicker, cleaner job of con-
verting heavy residual oil into gasoline, gas oil,
and coke. It paid off spectacularly when catalytic
cracking was invented and these giant new units
began calling for feed. It paid off again when the
diesel locomotive came along to put the heavy oil
burning steam locomotive out of business.
Dr. Robert E. Wilson, chairman of the board of
Standard Oil today, was the inventor of delayed
coking. Almost all of the young scientists who
worked with him in its development are still with
Standard too, in responsible positions requiring
their special skills.
Young scientists in research and engineering at
Standard Oil today find it satisfying to see their
creative efforts translated into valuable product
and process improvements.

The Electrical Engineering Department
will participate actively and to a signifi-
cant degree in the program of the Inter-
national Geophysical Year, under the
sponsorship primarily of the U. S. Air
Force, and, to a lesser degree, of the U.S.
National Committee for the IGY. The
program contemplated will be conducted
in the general area of research in the up-
per atmosphere of the Earth, with par-
ticular reference to the measurement of
ambient atmospheric pressure, tempera-
ture, density, winds, and, possibly, the
ion and electron concentration at various
points in the ionosphere. All experiments
will be conducted through use of rockets
which will be considered primarily as
vehicles for transporting appropriate sci-
entific equipment through the desired
altitude ranges.
The rocket launchings will be conduct-
ed almost exclusively in the near arctic
regions at Ft. Churchill, Canada, on Hud-
son's Bay, for the reason that this particu-
lar location has logistic merits and, scien-
tifically important, lies rather well within
the Earth's northern auroral zone. Experi-
mentation in the auroral zone is of par-
ticular interest during the International
Geophysical Year which will occur by de-
sign at a time of maximum sunspot activ-
ity. Inasmuch as the earth's aurora is be-
lieved to be caused by a combination of
factors including effects due to the Earth's
magnetic field and the sun's radiation,
and that auroral effects are important ele-
ments in determining the continuity of
communication by electrical means, a
matter of importance in the world today,
the desire for experimentation at the
higher latitudes becomes more apparent.
The pressure, temperature and winds
of the upper atmosphere are similarly of
importance to man, for it is now believed
that conditions in the atmosphere at alti-
tudes up to at least 50 miles have an im-
portant effect upon weather at the earth's
surface, and thus greater knowledge of
these phenomena will enable more accur-
ate prediction of future surface weather
conditions. In addition, knowledge of
these parameters of the upper atmosphere
is of importance for military considera-
tion. These reasons are of course valid
quite aside from any International Geo-
physical Year considerations, which are
significantly important because of the con-
certed effort and the possibility of ob-
taining measurements of various para-
meters at several points on the earth's
surface nearly simultaneously.
Scientific investigation of the upper at-
mosphere by means of rockets is a rela-
tively new field of endeavor, the first ex-
periments having been conducted oniv
ten years ago following World 'War li
when the German V-2 rocket became
available for this purpose. The Electrical
Engineering Department has been active
throughout this ten-year period in this
new field, having first conducted an ex-
periment in the upper atmosphere during
August, 1946.
There have been several significant re-
sults of this work, including (a) many
measurements of upper air pressures and
temperatures to altitudes of 60 miles, (b)
development of a new method for tem-
perature determination, (c) an opportun-
ity for nearly 200 undergraduates and
graduate students to obtain employment
in a cognate field and (d) the gaining of
experience which permits participation in
the IGY program.
Several other groups in the country in-
cluding one in the University's Aeronauti-
cal Engineering Department have similar-
ly participated actively in upper atmo-
sphere research via rockets, and it is such
experienced groups that are conducting
rocket research programs as a part of the
International Geophysical Year program.
The Electrical Engineering Department
research group will participate in approxi-
mately 20 rocket firings during the IGY.

A drawing of the trajectory (flight path) of the Navy Martin Van-
guard research vehicle, depicting burnout position of the three stages of

tween 200 and 400 miles above theearth. This is part of U. S. participa-
tion in the International Geophysical Year, 1957-1958.
Man is tossing out the first stepping
stones toward space travel as scientists
plan to launch a series of unmanned
satellites during the International Geo-
physical Year.
At least ten satellites will be launched,
by three stage rockets, to circle the earth
for two weeks to two months and gather
data from the ionsphere until, pulled into
the earth's gravitational field, they are
consumed by friction with the denser at-
mosphere. Using satellites, instruments
can be placed in the outer atmosphere to
take continual readings that are difficult
to obtain during brief rocket flights.
The first of the man-made moons
launched during IGY will be elliptical
shaped and about 30 inches long, accord-
ing to revised plans announced by Dr.
Joseph Kaplan of UCLA and chairman
of the U. S. National committee for IGY.
They will be equipped to gather and re-
lay information about the densities of:
the upper atmosphere; the hydrogen
molecules present at the heights; and the
microscopic particles in the meteor stream.
Information will also be gathered on:
The composition of the earth's crust; the
precise shape of the globe; ultraviolet
radiation from the sun; the action of cos-
mic rays; and the electrical currents in
the ionsphere.
However, instrumentation will not be
the same in each of the satellites. A num-
ber of various methods for gathering the
desired data are being proposed by vari-
ous groups, and it is expected that at
least several techniques will be tried.
Besides recording and transmitting in-
formation to observers on the earth, the
satellites will also be used in making sur-
veys of the earth. Once the man-made
moon is in the sky with a perfectly estab-
lished orbit, it can be used for triangu-
lation, aiding both surveying and naviga-
tion.
Looking past the first small unmanned
satellites into the more distant future,
uses for satellites are seen in the field of
communication. Man-made moons are
suggested as replacements for trans-
oceanic cables and as relay for television
transmission between Europe and tht
United States. Also envisioned is the con-
struction of a large satellite to serve as a
launching platform and refueling plat-
form for space ships.
However, the first steps towards the fu-
ture will begin with launching small
satellites from Patrick Air Force Base on
the east coast of Florida with the aid of
$28,000,000 asked from Congress.
Launching the Satellites
Under the announced plans, the IGY
satellites will be launched in a equitorial

rather than a north-south circumpolar
orbit, permitting observers in the United
States, Central and South America, Africa
and southern Europe to track the object
either visually or by radio signals. The
satellite, zooming from horizon to hori-
zon in eight toten minutes, will cover a
5,000 mile wide path between 40 degrees
north (the latitude of Columbus, Ohio)
and 440 degrees south latitude.
The space missiles will be fired into
the earth's atmosphere at an angle of 40°
to the equator by a three stage rocket.
Within two minutes after takeoff, the 21.5
lb. head will be given a velocity of
4,000 miles an hour by the first rocket
which then falls off towards earth at a
height of 30 to 40 miles.
The second rocket will boost the unit
to a speed of 11,000 miles per hour an
altitude of around 130 miles. As this
rocket burns out, the remaining unit will
coast under its own guidance into the
satellite trajectory.
Then, the third rockets blast in to in-
crease the velocity to 18,000 miles an
hour and the man-made moon settles into
the orbit it will travel around the earth.
The height will vary from 200 miles to
800 miles high as the satellite's path
traces an ellipse around earth.
Man-Made Moons and Michigan
An important phase in the satellite-
project is the rocket launching of the
units and according to the National Acad-
emy of Sciences, the University of Michi-
gan rocket experts have done an out-
standing job in paving the way towards
launching the first satellite.
Many contributions to rocket launching
techniques have been made by the re-
search groups, one in the electrican engi-
neering department and one in the aero-
nautical engineering department. Since
1946 the two groups have taken part in
the firing of more than 400 rockets in an
Air Force project to gather information
from the outer atmosphere, including data
on the density of the air.
The Electrical department group, under
Nelson Spencer, has been gathering data
through electronic instrumentation, in the
rockets while the aeronautical group,
under Leslie Jones, uses aluminum
spheres dropped from rockets. Proposals
to launch a satellite utilizing their own
methods of data gathering have been sub-
mitted by each group and are now being
considered.

MODERN PROCESSING
Low cost dies by welded fabrication
for low production stampings.
By LEE E. ALLGOOD '56 I.E.
Modern processing today depends on
techniques that will produce large quanti-
ties of dimensionally stable parts at the
lowest possible unit cost. Among the
various basic techniques employed, metal
stamping plays a dominent role.
When fabrication by stamping is being
considered, one tends to think of high
production runs in which many parts arc-
produced at one set-up of the die in the
press. It is proper to ask the question:
"How many parts constitute 'high produc-
tion' if the processing is to be economi-
cally feasible?" There certainly is no pat
answer to this question, but it is the in-
tent of this paper to demonstrate that
quantities as low as ten thousand can be-
economically produced, even where a die
must be built.
Basically there are these ways in which
a given part may be processed by stamp-
ing operations:
(1) Standard dies and piercing units.
(2) Use a series of small dies with or
without subsequent machining operations.
(3) Complete fabrication in one unit,
commonly in a progressive, transfer, or
combination die.
The advantage of the first approach is
that the tooling investment is usually
lower even though more operations might
be required. The primary objection to this
method of processing is that more man-
hours per part are required as well as
larger work-in-process inventories, result-
ing in larger burden charges per finished
piece. Unfortunately, many small and me-
dium sized production shops must operate
under these conditions for low produc-
tion runs since the alternative requires a
substantially greater initial investment.
Despite the fact that processing the part
for a progressive die reduces both the
direct man-hours per piece and the work-
in-process inventory, the difference in the
initial investment is still generally pro-
hibitive.
There are many additional cases where
the manufacturer would prefer to use
blanking, compound blank and pierce or
form dies but the tooling cost makes this
type of fabrication entirely impractical.1
The producer must then resort either to
shearing or to bandsawing the blanks,
and then use commercially available
standard piercing units or drilling opera-
tions to produce holes. Invariably for
1 If the reader is not familiar with the opera-
tions referred to above, see Crane, E. V., Plas-
tic Working of Melals (New York, John Wiley
&amp; Sons, Sec. Ed., 1939) for a complete de-
scription.

forming operations, the investment in a
f orm die is mandatory, although for cer-
tain types of forms, commercial units are
also available.
There is still another serious objection
to this type of processing, namely, that
of dimensional stability. If the particular
part has any critical dimensional toler-
ances, the statistical probability of ob-
j ectionable accumulative error is greatly
i ncreased with the number of separate
processing operations.
The choice of processing would be
obvious if the unit cost per piece would
permit investment in a progressive die.2
The problem is then resolved to one of
analyzing the various factors that consti-
tute the total cost of putting a progres-
sive die into production. The cost, in
order of proportional magnitude, are
generally considered to be tool-room-time,
material, design time and die tryout time.
The tool-room-time consists primarily
of machining and fitting time. Excluding
the necessity of any Kellering or similar
operations, the machining consists primar-
ily of grinding parts, boring locational
(dowel) holes, and tapping screw holes.
This work requires very careful coordi-
nation by a diemaker. The material varies
with each job, but generally involves sub-
stantial cost in the purchase of a commer-
cially available die set. Die tryout time
is the time required for the diemaker to
make the die perform according to the
design and product specifications after
assembly.
It is the purpose of this paper to pre-
sent a design for a die whose fabrication
will be achieved by arc welding. Such a
design will possibly eliminate the need
for a diemaker, and not only greatly re-
duce the tool-room-time, but also the ma-
terial requirements and design time. The
reader is encouraged to read beyond the
following description of the design and
fabrication of the die, since the basic
technique can result not only in consid-
erable pressroom standardization but also
in additional cost reduction.
The design illustrated in this paper is
for the small, typical metal part shown in
exhibit number one. The part was select-
ed because it is small and can be handled
conveniently within the space limitations
of this paper, but it should be kept in
2 Throughout this paper, reference is made
to progressive operations, since the investment
cost of this type of die is generally considered
to be the greatest. It is also the most desirable
method possible; however, the reader should
keep in mind that the discussion is applicable
to other types of stamping techniques.
mind that it could just as easily have
reached the proportion of an automobile
or refrigerator door panel. The part was
further selected since it is readily adapt-
able to progressive processing. The pro-
cessing requires the use of a two-station
progressive die to pierce two (2) holes
and to cut off and form complete. Before
reading further, the reader is urged to
study exhibit number two, which is a
drawing of the punch and die, to see the
lunctional relationship ot these two units
and to familiarize himself with the no-
menclature used for various components.
Before discussing actual fabrication of
the die, the method of mounting the die
into the press should be explained. There
are basically two methods by which this
may be accomplished, each requiring
the use of a fixture made from a com-
mercial die set and mounted in the press.
Under no circumstances should the
die be mounted without this fixture.
The choice of mounting is complete-
ly independent of the method of fab-
rication of the die and is a function
of the time required for installation into
the press and the initial investment in
the fixture only. The first method permits
the lower shoe to be mounted without
clamping by floating location on ground
dowel pins with the punch holder screw-
ed in position and location coming from
a precision ground shoulder on each
screw. This method requires the use of a
drill jig for locating four (4) reamed
mounting holes in each of the upper and
lower shoes. The advantage lies in the
saving of installation time that will make
it economical to set up for a run as low
as fifty parts at a time. If many different
parts are to be run in the same press
during the working day, this method is to
be recommended. The second method is
the conventional method of screwing
both shoes into the fixture. No drill jig
is required for locating holes in the shoes,
since drilled clearance holes are all that
are required. The fixture should be
equipped with guide pins and bushings
to insure perfect alignment of the upper
and lower shoes. The guide pins should
be well lubricated and, ideally, should not
leave the bushing during the upward press
stroke. Note that the four small locator
pins should not be relied upon for shoe
alignment. Further, the location of these
locator pins is entirely independent of the
dimensional tolerance required for mount-
ing the die in the press.
Operation of the Die
The operator (for the first piece)
should feed the stock, coil or strip, to
the cutoff edge, locating the stock by
sight. The press is then activated, pierc-
ing the two (2) holes in the first piece.
The operator next feeds the stock until it
is positively stopped against the combina-
tion heel and gauge block. The press is
now tripped for the second time. This
time the first piece is completed and the
holes are pierced in the second piece.
The finished piece may be removed man-
ually or by an air blast. Note that a gauge
could be used, as in a conventional die,
for locating the first piece but that the
cost will generally make this impractic-
able.
Construction of the Die
The overall construction of the die

tion of each individual component
through the final assembly. The detail of
heat treating and welding requirements
will be discussed in detail in the next
section of this paper but will be present-
ly referred to as required. Certain tech-
nical considerations in die design and
construction will be referred to and
footnoted but will not be discussed in de-
tail because it is not the intent of this
paper to present a thesis on die design.
However, critical factors will be empha-
sized.
The base and retainer plates should
first be obtained from a mild steel stock
(SAE-1010-1020) of the correct thick-
ness. These plates should be examined to
insure a minimum of warpage. The thick-
nesses for these plates is usually about
.25 inches, but certain cases may necessi-
tate thicker plates.
The first punch (.25 in. diameter) may
be located by direct layout on the punch
plate. The rest of the assembly will be
dimensionally located with respect to
this center. The second punch center can
be established by direct layout from the
first or by the use of a template of the
part developed in the toolroom. The ac-
curacy of location of these centers must
be such as to produce a finished part
within the tolerance of all final dimen-
sions affected by the hole locations. To
accomplish this, it is customary to utilize
only about sixty percent of the working
tolerance. The holes should now be ma-
chined to fit the body of the punches
tight enough to insure positive lateral
location. The holes are then countersunk
to facilitate peaning of the punch heads.
Figure 1 shows a highly recommended
alternate method of installing punches
having a point diameter larger than .50
in. or for rectangular points. This involves
turning a body larger than the punch
diameter. The punch to have a head on
the end. The sole purpose of the head is
to facilitate plug welding the punch to
the upper plate.
The punch should be made to the exact
hole size since, due to the shearing of the
metal, the punch will produce a hole-
slightly oversize when new.3 This will
permit the punch to produce holes to the
correct size as the punch wears, thus in-
creasing its effective life. The punch ma-
terial for the straight type is drill rod;
and for the special type, SAE-4130, flame
hardened to 540 BHN.4
Punch supports should be provided for
each punch. These may be manufactured
from SAE-1010 or any scrap machine
steel available. The purpose of these sup-
ports is to minimize lateral deflection of
the punches at the instant of contact with
the work. The supports should fit the
punch body with a slip fit. Installation is
accomplished by welding to the punch
shoe with location from the bodies of the
punches. The punches must be five-six-
teenths (5 16) of an inch longer than
actually required to later facilitate shear-
ing of the die. This additional length will
put the bottom of the cutoff punch and
the piercing punches in the same horizon-
tal plane.
The combination cutoff punch and male
form member is made from SAE-4130,
with the cutoff edge, form contour and
heel surface being flame hardened to 540
BHN. The length of the block is critical
and must exactly duplicate the developed
length of the blank. The contour is best
duplicated by use of a template of the
part but may be established by layout.
The surface may be machined by band-
sawing the contour, with subsequent band
filing and grinding operations. This mem-
ber must heel against the heel block
mounted to the die to insure accurate
establishment of the blank gauge length
:l A sharp punch will actually shear only
about one third of the metal thickness, the re-
maining amount being a tearing action that
will give an oversize hole on the back side of
the stock. For a discussion of this, see E. V.
Crane, op. til., cp. 3.
'The flame hardening of all items except
piercing punches should be done after as-
sembly of the die.
and resist lateral thrust during cutting
The cutting edge of the punch should
contact the stock at least one stock thid
ncss in advance of the piercing punches
The four (4) locator bushings shoulc
now be prepared for installation.3 The
bushings should be machined from 1.0
inch diameter SAE 1045 steel. These
bushings need not be hardened. The in-
side diameter is nominally .500 in., with
the exact dimensions being such as to pro-
vide a sliding fit over the pins. The bush-
ings are located at any convenient posi-
tion on the punch shoe but as far from
the working area as possible without in-
terference with the mounting holes. .62
inch diameter clearance holes are drilled
in the punch plate after location.
The upper shoe (punch) is now ready
for assembly. At this time the four screw
holes for the retainer plate should be
tapped into the punch plate. This is the
only tapping operation in the entire die.
The cutoff and form punch is now posi-
tioned for final assembly. This is easily
accomplished, inasmuch as there is no
die clearance in the punch section so that
the cutoff edge is established by the final
part print dimension from the .25 diam-
eter hole to the end of the part. The
member is then securely clamped in posi-
tion. The locator bushings and punch
supports are now clamped in place and
the punch is ready for welding. Note that
the cutoff punch could be plug welded
but that no time-saving advantage would
be obtained in this particular die.
The importance of rigid support and
solid clamping cannot be overemphasized
in dies of this type. In almost all cases,
comparatively large bulky sections are
welded to thin plates making warpage a
very real problem. Excessive warpage will

could be- prepared in quantity and stocked,
since the same sized pins and bushings would
be used for all dies. Where longer pins or
bushings are required, either of these items
may be welded to riser blocks.

The electric typewriter suddenly came
to life.
I'll kill you, it typed. /';// going to kill
every one of you.
The technician on duty walked over
to it and looked at the message.
"Holy smoke!" he muttered and hur-
ried out of the great room.
There was no noise in the laboratory
now except for the fans cooling ERNIE.
There was no movement except for the
flickering lights on the control panel.
The technician returned to the room
with a small group of other men.
"Let's sec this new statement of his,"
one was saying.
"ERNIE's getting touchy, huh?"
"This I'll only believe when I see it."
The first technician walked over to the
electric typewriter and tore off the mes-
sage.
"Well, I'll be a son of a gun" one
said as he read it. "Here, look at it,
Myers."
"I don't get it. Does ERNIE really
mean this?" Myers said.
6789012345
Above the group stood ERNIE, a pair
of gray metal cabinets 30 feet tall.
ERNIE, the Extended Range Nehr-
man Information Exchanger, consisted of
two giant crystal growths. Five years be-
fore, Johann Nehrmann had developed
crystal structures which could serve as
simple electrical circuits. With slight
modifications, computer circuits could be
grown as easily as quartz.
After several conventional computing
machines were "grown", the scientists
went to work on ERNIE. The new in-
formation exchanger's capacity made the
mightiest individually circuited computer
look like a tinker-toy.
Theoretically, ERNIE could solve any
problem in the universe. However, there
was the difficulty of translating informa-
tion of complex social or political matters
into terms ERNIE could understand.
For this reason, ERNIE had certain
basic concepts built into him. After his
construction, secretaries spent months
feeding definitions into the machine in
terms of the primitive concepts.
Then mathematical formulae were fed
into his electrical typewriter, arithmetic,
calculus, game theory, and equations in
symbolic logic. Next, simple sentences
and social concepts were typed into the
information exchanger. It was difficult to
determine how much it comprehended.
In keeping with theory (although most
of the scientists did not place too much
faith in it), ERNIE was read complex
books and magazines far above what he
should be able to comprehend, in the
hope it would stimulate ERNIE to do
more "thinking."
There was only one catch to Nehrman
information exchangers. They were un-
predictable. Demon circuits inevitably
crop up in the crystal growths. In a con-
ventional individually circuited computer,
the operator knows exactly what happens
to a bit of information at each stage. But
anything could happen in a Nehrman
crystal.
But ERNIE was productive. It usual-
ly answered questions submitted to it, but
not always. Sometimes it volunteered in-

formation. A month before it spontan-
eously typed out a group of equations
which, when submitted to mathematical
journals, were hailed as the greatest de-
velopment of the century.
Most of ERNIE's work was for the
Defense Department, but since so many
of the problems it solved were beyond
the realm of defense, a good deal of the
information provided was released.
"Can you figure it out, Joe?" Myers
was saying, looking at the message.
"Sure," the other said. "Very simple."
"Every so often ERNIE starts grinding
out Jabber-work. Remember those equa-
tions last year. The math boys suffered
over them for weeks until they finally
figured out they were nonsense. Trash,
pure and simple. They had no logic to
them.
"And then just a couple of weeks ago,
it just started typing out nonsense phrases.
'Congat tharp squafidation,' I forget what
the exact words were. But it's the same
thing here. I think old Curtis has been
reading it detective novels again. You
could just say it's—uh—'regurgitating'
old phrases it once must have come-
across."
"Yes. That's probably it," Myers said.
"Of course that's it. ERNIE can't have
feelings. It's only a machine."
The technician named Myers, sat back
in the chair. They were the only two in
the laboratory now, except of course for
ERNIE. He wondered what was going
on inside the machine, what information
was being processed.
"You know this self-programming al-
most gives ERNIE a mind of his own."
"Don't get carried away, Myers. ER-
NIE can't think. It has no mind."
Myers lit a cigarette. The five flicker-
ing lights on the control panel seemed
to be watching him. Suddenly he felt
very uneasy.
"Yes, I know. But sometimes . . ."
Before he could finish, the electric
typewriter began clattering.
"Uh-oh, something's up."
Joe ran over to the typewriter and read
the message.
"Hey, what is this? Look, Myers, I
told you he's gone off on a nonsense
spree. Read this."
Myers read it.
Once upon a lime, it began, there
lived a poor fisherman. Faithfully every
day he went to the sea and hoped for a
good catch. . . .
"A fairy tale," Myers said. "Wait a
minute, we read him a book of fairy
tales, didn't we?"
"Sure, about a year and a half ago."
. . . One day he found a bottle with a
cork stopper which had been washed
ashore. The poor fisherman examined the
bottle from all sides. It was worn smooth
by the sea. It looked as if it had been
in the sea for hundreds of years. . . .
"He's coughing up the old story word
for word," Myers said.
. . . The poor fisherman wondered what
was inside the bottle. He held it up to the
sun but could see nothing. So he pulled
the cork. With a terrific rush of air, a
thick black substance poured out of the

Today's most valuable military aircraft, capable of
supersonic or intercontinental flight, include various
Air Force and Navy fighters, bombers and trans-
ports. Among these are nine types that have a
significant feature in common. They all fly on one
type of engine — the J-57 turbojet.
Also entrusted to the efficient, dependable opera-

be the commercial jet transports soon to travel along
the air lanes of the world.
The excellence of the J-57 is attributed to the
engineering team that has determinedly maintained
World"* foremost designer and builder
of aircraft engines
its leadership in the field of aircraft powerplants. Ef-
fort is now being directed toward the improvement
of advanced jet and turboprop designs. Still to be
anticipated is mastery of current technology's most
provocative problem — the successful development
of a nuclear aircraft engine.
Many engineering graduates would like to be
concerned with the air power of the next generation.
One way to fulfill that ambition is to pursue a
career alongside the Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft en-
gineers who have consistently produced the world's
best aircraft engines.

bottle. The poor fisherman jell down lo
the ground afraid of what he saw. The
swirling black substance heaved and
throbbed. and then began forming itself
together. Before the fisherman's eyes, the
black substance formed into the figure of
a great lowering Genie. As the last of
the black substance flowed into place, the
Genie looked down upon the trembling
fisherman and gave a mighty, thunderous
laugh. "O good Genie," the fisherman
said, "my days of want will be over. I
shall have you build me a palace with a
thousand servants." . . .
"What got into the machine?" Myers
asked. "It never pulled anything like
this before."
"When they said Nehnnan crystals
were unpredictable, they weren't kid-
ding!"
. . . The Great Genie laughed again.
"Alas, poor fisherman, you shall hare no
palace. I have been within that bottle for
three thousand yeats. We Genii have
much patience. For the first thousand
years I told myself, whoever releases
me from the bottle shall have whatever
he desires. For the second thousand years,
I told myself, whoever releases me from
the bottle shall have nothing. And for
the last thousand years, I told myself,
whoever releases me from the bottle will
die.
"It's stopped," said Myers. "But that's
not the end of the story.
"Maybe ERNIE thinks it is."
"What is it all about? Why would
ERNIE pull something like that out of a
clear blue sky?"
"It's the demon circuits. The unpredict-
ability. The imperfections in the crystals."
"But what does it mean? '. . . whoever
releases me from the bottle will die'."
"It's nonsense. Can't you see that? It's
just some information that got thrown
into the wrong circuit and came back
out over the typewriter."
Myers stared at the typewritten paper.
"What was all the racket in here?"
another technician said as he walked in.
"ERNIE written another message?"
"It wrote us a story."
"A story?"
"A fairy tale."
"You're kidding."
"See for yourself."
"You know, I have an idea," Myers
said.
"What?" Joe asked.
"ERNIE's trying to hint he's mad about
something."
"A machine getting mad about some-
thing?"
"Maybe he pictures himself as that
Genie. Look at ERNIE. Blind, deaf,
dumb. His only means of contact with
the world is through the typewriter."
"Say Myers, let's not be ridiculous."
"I'm serious. Look, here he is, for
years. Maybe he wants information. He
seems to react most agreeably after new
information is typed into him. Well, for
two years, every day without fail, book
after book of one sort or another is typed
into him. Then all of a sudden we stop,
as we did six months ago. It's just as if
he were locked in a bottle and thrown
out to sea. He's completely helpless."
"You're nuts, Myers. ERNIE's a ma-
chine. It doesn't have emotions."
"How do we know what sort of ideas
those demon circuits give him?"
"Get out of here. You've been reading
too much."
"But just suppose for a minute he
meant what he said."
"All right. Just for a minute. So he
wants to kill every one of us."
"There's only one catch, Myers."
"What's that?"
"He's as helpless as a baby. No, even
Myers said at the door of their home.
"Not much trouble. A little puzzling
though."
"Well, make yourself comfortable. Din-
ner will be ready in a second."
Myers began reading the paper. No
news. Washington still squabbling about
the coming elections. Trouble in Asia.
A crank in New Jersey threatening to
blow up the world unless it converts to
vegetarianism.
"Dinner's ready," Mrs. Myers called.
He went in and sat down. They began
eating.
"Is anything the matter," Mrs. Myers
said. "You look worried."
"Yes. Something I can't figure out. It
doesn't make any sense."
"Is it connected with your work?"
"Mm-hmm. I don't know how to ex-
plain it to you, though."
He was silent for a moment, then said,
"Suppose you were completely helpless.
Blind, deaf, couldn't move a muscle."
His wife wrinkled her brow.
"And suppose you wanted to kill some-
one. I mean just hypothetically."
Mrs. Myers gave a nervous laugh. "I
don't understand."
"You want to kill somebody but you're
helpless. All you can do is talk. How
could you do it."
"You mean, to murder somebody by
just speaking?"
"Yes."

more helpless. What could he possibly
do to us? As you said, ERNIE is blind,
deaf, dumb. He can't move an atom of
anything, except his typewriter keys."
"Yes," Myers said, forced to agree.
"So what can he do?"
Myers bit his lip for a minute. "He
could give out incorrect information."
"Don't be silly. We check all the in-
formation he gives out. If the equations
and statements make sense, we use them.
And if they don't, as is sometimes the
case, we don't use them."
"Um-hmm," Myers agreed.
"So ERNIE is the most impotent thing
in the world."
* * *
"How was work today, dear?" Mrs.
"I don't know. I haven't any idea."
"That's the problem. Is there anything
—is there any way you could kill this
person?"
Mrs. Myers thought for a while.
"No," she said. "I can't imagine how
there could be."
"The trouble is, I think there is a
way."
"Well, what is it?" she asked.
"That's what I don't know."
"This is certainly a strange subject."
"If only I could find out the answer.
Suppose you want to kill more than any-
thing else in the world. You'd go to any
extreme, but of course you're completely
helpless."

"Infinity is a place where things hap-
pen that don't."—Statement made by a
schoolboy.
Whoever that schoolboy was, it is un-
fortunate if his remark got no further
than W. W. Sawyer's book, Prelude to
Mathematics. It is indeed too bad that we
are not taught that statement along with
"7 times 8 is 56." In many instances we
would have trouble getting along without
the idea of an infinitely long, straight,
wire, of an infinitely long period of time
after a switch is closed. Still, there are
many times when we'd like to moan,
along with the gal who just washed her
hair, ". . . and I can't do a thing with
it!" F'r instance. . . .
Supposing Professor R. K. Ritt of ye
olde math crowde said to you and your
classmates as he has to others: At every
instant of time 12:00—30X2 ", a man
who has never had a ping-pong ball to
his name receives ten ping-pong balls.
To each of these balls he assigns a num-
ber denoting which of all the balls he
ever receives that ball is. The man then
puts all the balls in a storage bin and
chooses one of the balls in the bin. This
ball he proceeds to destroy. The whole
process, from receiving to destroying, is
assumed to take zero time. Disregarding
all physical difficulties or impossibilities—
from friction, fatigue, limitation of nat-
ural resources, size of storage bin, com-
bustion products, to phenomena at the
speed of light—explain how at 12:00
the man may have any of the following
numbers of ping-pong balls: 0, 7, and
13. If those numbers don't suit you,
choose some others; they will do as well.
Some people are worried that man will
increasingly be replaced by machines. Sup-
posing that such a thing were indisput-
ably happening, it is almost certain that
the psychologists would be imploring us
to put ourselves on the mountings of
those machines and to envision things as
registered by their photoelectric cells. At
what better place could we start than with
one of their languages?
Unlike most people (engineers pos-
sibly excepted), digital computing ma-
chines carry on all communications in
arithmetic, binary arithmetic. Now that
is a switch. We use a total of ten digits;
machines use only two: 0 and 1. A deci-
mal-binary dictionary would consist of a
table such as this:
Decimal
System
Binary
Radix
Ec|
livalent

1
2
21
10
A
22
100
8
23
1000
16
V
10000
Thus, some typical numbers would be:
5=4+l=22 + 2"=100-f 1=101,
6=4-j-2=22-f 2'=100+ 10=110,
7=4-f-3=22 + 21 + 2"=100-f 10-f 1=
111.
This fills in the gap between 4=100 and
8=1000. Other such gaps between higher
powers of two are filled analogously.
There are three basic addition proc-
esses in binary arithmetic: 0-)-0=0, l-f-0
= 1, 1+1=10. Zero times a number is
equal to zero; one times a number is
equal to the number. These pieces of in-
formation, along with your knowledge
of decimal arithmetic, should enable you
to perform the following operations in
binary arithmetic: 37—15=?, 9=64=?,
and 61^X5 1/128=?
If you've got those operations down
pat you might like to mull over these
ideas for a while: One-third becomes a
repeating decimal fraction in our number
system; our handy . 1 in the decimal sys-
tem becomes a repeating number array
following a "decimal" point in the binary
system. What kind of money and meas-
urement systems would logically evolve in
a culture based on the binary system?
Would a binary slide rule be feasible?
Last month we asked some questions;
here are some answers:
1) B's rate is 10 miles per day. By let-
ting x=distance B traveled in 9 days,
equations can be set up for the rate,
time, and distance traveled involving x as
the only unknown.
2) R. T. Flywheel was late to class:
He would have had to average 30 miles
per hour for his 2-mile trip. The trip
takes 4 minutes. On the morning speci-
fied, the entire 4 minutes was spent cuss-
ing at least one woman driver. The re-
maining mile must therefore be traveled
in no time. Detroit, we are told, is work-
ing on this problem.
3) According to Physics 45 and Archi-
medes' Principle, the stones will displact-
an equal weight of water while they are
in the boat. While in the water they dis-
place an equal volume of water. Conse-
quently, more water was displaced when
the stones were still ballast, and the water
level went down when the stones were
cast out.
4) When your train has just left Ra-
cine there are 9 trains in progress on the
opposite track. Every 5 minutes that you
ride another train leaves Howard so
that 9 additional trains leave. However,
omitting the one leaving the 69th Street
terminal when you arrive, only eight
trains depart while you are in progress
You therefore see 17 trains in all.
5) Using the concept of a 4x4 check
erboard, it is obvious that an odd number
of steps will be needed to get from one
corner to the diagonally opposite (and
therefore similarly colored) square.
And if you try and try, and still think
our friend has ping-pong balls comint
out of his ears, come around next month
when we'll try to straighten him out.

not only destroy dimensional stability
but can also result in permanent damage
to the die during operation in the press.
A suggestion in connection with this is to
stagger welds over the entire surface and
among all parts to be welded rather thin
weld one piece completely at a time. Pin--
that must be accurately located may be
tack welded and then checked before final
welding.
These parts can be welded by using a
three-sixteenths (3.16) to one-quarter
(J/4) inch diameter E-6015 standard elec-
trode. The amperage required is from
160 to 375 depending on the electrode
diameter.'' The E-6016 electrode is recom-
mended since it may be used with either
A.C. or D.C.. reverse polarity current.
The heel side of the form punch
should be fillet welded across the entire
length. This will furnish additional thrust
support during cutting and forming.
There is no need for a continuous fillet
weld along the other sides. Experience
and the use of discretion on the part of
the welder (generally the die mechanic )
are important during this operation since
both welding time and material can be
saved.
After the punch section has cooled,
it should be mounted in a press in prep-
aration for shearing the matting die sec-
tion after this unit has been partially as-
sembled. Since there are no mounting
holes in the punch shoe yet, this unit will
have to be clamped to the ram of the
press. Note that this is the only time the
punch is mounted in the press without
the mounting fixture. If there are any
large knockout holes or clearance holes
in the ram of the press, the punch holder
should be mounted to a ram adapter plate
which is at least two (2) inches thick.
The die filler block, stock-support and
cutoff steel should now be cut to size and
welded together. The length of the
filler block and cutoff steel should be a
minimum of one-sixty-fourth (1/64) of
an inch longer than the final assembly
size after welding. This unit is best
welded by using a single-bevel groove
joint for the cutoff steel. This weld is
not suitable for high impact loads,
but will be adequate in this case since it is

Another Antarctic Expedition
calls on COLLINS
for communication
U.S. Navy Task Force 43 is establishing several
bases in Antarctica in conjunction with the
International Geophysical Year activities. Two
bases will be built next year, one of them at the
South Pole. The expedition, appropriately en-
titled "Operation Deepfreeze," is under the
direction of Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd and
commanded by Rear Admiral George Dufek.
For radio contact between bases and the outside
world, the commercial and amateur communi-
cation equipment will be Collins.
The name Collins has figured prominently in
polar expeditions since 1925. During Admiral
Byrd's expedition of the early 30's, Collins trans-
mitters were used in the first Arctic/Antarctic
communication link—from the Byrd Expedition
(Antarctic) to a CBS station in Northern Alaska.
The Collins equipment is specially packaged for
air drop and long sledge journeys. Superior per-
formance and reliability, proven time and again,
make Collins the logical choice when the need
for radio communication is vital.

a one hundred fifty mile thick layer of

erable influence on radio reception. The
internal variations seem to be affected by
activity on the sun, and so will also be
studied with relation to its varied rays.
This knowledge of the characteristics of
the upper air is vital to the space travel
of the not-too-distant future.
Sunspot activity will reach an eleven-
year high during 1957-58; this was one
of the reasons for the choice of the year.
Along with the effect on our other
weather, IGY workers correlate the flares
with geomagnetic phenomena and the
spectacle of the aurora borealis. This last,
though lovely, constitutes a hazard to
radio navigation that sometimes becomes
disastrous. The aurora is the terminal end
of the path of ionized particles from the
sun, and the only visible portion of that
path. Through it, theoretical geophysi-
cists are enabled to study the stream it-
self, its path through space, its capture-
in the equatorial ring, and its subsequent

Engineers designing the new Milliard Mult-Au-
Matic Type "L" vertical chucking machine were
faced with the problem of achieving high preci-
sion despite heavy work loads and high speeds.
To do this, they used Timken* tapered roller bear-
ings to furnish the precision and load-carrying
capacity required at the locating position.

Full line contact gives Tim ken
bearings extra load capacity
Because the load is carried along a full line of contact be-
tween rollers and races, Timken bearings have extra load-
carrying capacity. And their tapered construction permits
them to take radial and thrust loads in any combination.
Result: shafts are held in rigid alignment, shaft deflection
and end play are minimized, gears mesh smoothly, spindle
precision is assured at high speeds.

WERNHER VON BRAUN
ROCKET EXPERT
For the past several months the staff
of the Michigan Technic has been work-
ing to develop a new series of articles of
interest to the engineer. Finally a series
entitled "Who's Who in Engineering"
was decided upon. This topic deals with
the accomplishments that various out-
standing engineers have obtained in their
respective fields and will help enlighten
the readers as to who the famous men
are and what they have done in these
fields.
To initiate this series, the achievements
of the famous supersonic aerodynamic
engineer Wernher Von Braun have been
chosen.
Since today and in the near future
By TOM PRUNK
inter-planetary travel becomes more and
more a reality, the works of Dr. Wern-
her Von Braun can be more greatly ap-
preciated. This man has devoted many
years of his life to the study of rockets,
guided missiles, and jet propulsion. Prob-
ably his most famous invention was the
German V-2 rocket used against the
British in World War II. The deadly pur-
pose of this invention was against the
wishes of its inventor who would have
liked to use it to further his peace time
study of rockets, but the German high
command compelled him to augment a
possible German victory.
Dr. Von Braun's experience in the
field of rockets dates back to 1930, when
he assisted Germany's Professor Oberth
in some of the professor's early experi-
ments on rockets with liquid fuel. A few
months after this, Von Braun and several
of his engineering associates from various
technological institutes of Berlin and
Zurich worked on small rockets near the
outskirts of Berlin. In a short time the
experiments of this group attracted visi-
tors from the German Army Ordnance,
and in 1932, this rocket program was
transferred to the German Army Ord-
nance who financed it until the war's end.
Then, at the age of 22, Von Braun was
placed in charge of this program and
while still working on rockets for the
German Army, he obtained his Ph.D
degree from the University of Berlin
in 1934.
In 1936 shortly after Hitler's rise to
power, the German dictator became high-
ly interested in the warlike possibilities of
rockets—so much so that he poured mil-
lions of dollars into the development of
a rocket that could carry a large warhead
over a range much beyond that of artil-
lery. After several delays stemming from
squabbles in the Nazi party, a successful
rocket named the V-2 was finally launch-
ed in 194-4.
Because Dr. Von Braun was highly
against the wartime use of his rockets,
he surrendered to the United States forces
along with many other German engineers
and scientists. A short time later he was
given a contract to work for the Army
Ordnance Guided Missile Center in
Huntsville, Alabama, where he is now
working. While at his present job, the
tall, 42 year old engineer has delved into
the possibility of inter-planetary travel
to such an extent that he drew up an 869
day detailed description of an expedition
to Mars, beside writing a novel sched-
uled for publication as: Men Between
the Planets.
Obviously in the near future the works
and accomplishments of this great engi-
neer will be known even more widely
when this inter-planetary travel becomes
a reality.
Present at Dr. Von Braun's recent honorary Initiation to Michigans chapter of Tau
Beta Pi were left to right, Harold M. King, National President Tau Beta Pi, Dean

The block is to be welded along the sides
but not across the cutting edge. The stock
support is plug welded to the filler block
by using two (2) welding holes—located
to suit—of a minimum diameter of .50
in. These holes should be through the
filler block, not through the stock sup-
port. The same electrodes as previously
used are suitable, since the filler block
and stock support are made from SAE-
1020 while the die block is SAE-4130.
This assembly is now ready for shearing.
To facilitate this, it should be mounted
in the press beneath the punch as shown
in Figure 2. The surface of the cutoff
steel is then blued.
To shear the die, the press is brought
ally in the die (10 percent of .0625 on
the diameter).
The die holes should be bored and
ground to the dimension indicated above
to a maximum depth of .188 inches. Be-
low this level, a generous hole should be
provided for slug clearance. The cutoff
edge is now machined to provide die
clearance for the cutoff punch (.003 in-
ches inside the shear line).
The female form is now fabricated
from SAE-4130 in the same manner. The
contour face will later be flame hardened.
The heel block is made from SAE-
1020. If there is no undue distortion, no
machining other than providing a lead
for the cutoff punch is required.
The four (4) locator pins are fabri-
cated from one-inch diameter SAE 4130

able by air quenching) after assembly

the press to exert its total force on the

should be cut to the proper length. Thi-
length will permit the punches to enter
the die one and one-half times the metal

The various die components are now
roughly positioned on the die plate with
respect to the punch. From this location,
the holes for plug welding are establish-
ed and drilled. According to the Ameri-
can Welding Society, the minimum diam-
eter of these holes is to be .50 inches for
the thickness of the base plate used.* The
exact location of the die units will now
be established directly from the punch
as follows:
The die members arc inserted over the
matching punch sections with .003 in
thick shim stock inserted to take up the
die clearance. A piece of .0625 shim
stock should be placed on the horizontal
portions of the cutoff punch. This will
control the depth of punch entrance and
establish the proper operational relation-

clamped securely in preparation for plug
welding. The various units arc now plug

previously discussed. Staggering of the
welds is of prime importance during this
operation. Before unclamping the as-
sembly, the mounting holes must be pro-
duced.
If method one is to be used for install-
ing the die, the welded assembly should
be positioned in the drill jig. The mount-
ing holes should now be drilled and then
reamed to a slip fit for a nominal .500
inch diameter dowel pin. If method two

Two different rockets will be employed.
One, known as the "Aerobee," is ap-
proximately 15 inches in diameter and
25 feet long, and the other known as a
"Cajon" is approximately 6 inches in
diameter and 9 feet long. The Aerobee
will carry from 150 to 250 pounds of
equipment as high as 125 miles and the
Cajon "boosted" by an auxiliary rocket,
will carry 40-60 pounds 75 miles in alti-
tude. The first Cajon firing, considered as
a "prototype," is planned for July of this
year in New Mexico, and the second
Cajon for October 1956 at Ft. Churchill,
at which time the first prototype Aerobee
also will be launched. The balance of the
firings will, in most cases, occur during
the year (July 1957 to July 1958) desig-
nated officially as the IGY, at more or
less regular intervals.
Before indicating in general terms the
equipment to be employed in these rock-
ets, it may be helpful to assess the gen-
eral investigational problem.
The measurement of the pressure and
temperature of the atmosphere from a
rocket is challenging, for measurements
in the usual sense are not easily made
precisely, because of the large range of
values encountered, (several decades), the
great speed of the rocket from which the
measurements must be made, and the rela-
tive severity of the environment in which
the equipment must operate. The first two
points force one to consider means other
than the usual thermometer and pressure
gage. The last point may seem the least
significant but makes it necessary to be
especially careful in the construction and
use of the equipment in order to have the
greatest assurance of satisfactory perform-
ance during the rockets flight, where the
equipment must operate dependably with-
out attention from an operator.
The Electrical Engineering Department
group will conduct 2 independent experi-
ments in each Aerobee rocket, which will
enable determination of the ambient air
temperature essentially instantaneously
during the ascent of the rocket. Each ex-
periment enables a measurement of tht
Mach number (ratio of rocket C. G. ve-
locity to the velocity of sound) from
which the temperature is calculable.
The first method, that has been em-
ployed for several rocket firings enables
ambient temperature and pressure deter-
mination by means of pressure measure-
ments at selected points on the rocket's
nose cone. Specifically, through the use
of established aerodynamic relationships,
the pressure at a not too critical location
on the nose cone surface will, with i
knowledge of rocket velocity and "angle
of attack" (measure of how straight the
rocket flies), give the ambient pressure
directly. Similarly, the ratio of the head-
on or "impact" pressure at the tip of
the nose cone to this same cone wall
pressure is a function of and therefore a
measure of the Mach number, which as
noted above, permits knowledge of the
temperature.
The second method referred to above

You would hardly think that there was any connection between
the translucent building panels and the hard-working tires of
an earth mover—but there is.
"Allite" panels, a product of our Barrett Division, are made
of polyester resins. The tough rubber tires, like the ones on

aniline—one of the products of our National Aniline Division.
Both aniline and polyester resins require benzol, an Allied
basic chemical, in their manufacture.
Allied's chemicals in some way enter into nearly every manu-

WHY CERTAIN
DESIGNS SUCCEED
an idea to help
you advance faster
SUCCESSFUL designers state that
costs are the most important
factor in the success of any product
development today. Manufacturers
recognize this and, as a result, seek
out the engineers who are cost
minded.
Industry's stress on lower costs
comes from the increasing competi-
tion for buyers. Rising costs of ma-
terials and labor must be offset by
good designs to keep selling prices
down to realize a profit from sales.
Ingenious use of materials is the
best way you can eliminate needless
expense in manufacture. By using
steel as the basic material and weld-
ing for fabrication, you have a de-
cided advantage in saving money
for a manufacturing company . . .
and getting your designs accepted.
Cast Construction — Costs $28.13
Welded Steal Construction — Costs $6.49
Results from using welded steel
instead of gray iron are shown in
the above design comparison of a
typical bracket used on modern
machinery. The cast bracket costs
$28.13. The welded steel bracket
costs $6.49, weighs 65% less, yet is
stronger and more rigid than the
cast design.
Similar savings are possible in
many types of mechanical parts.
Therefore, it will pay you to know
how to utilize steel. Why not write

sets of .59 in. diameter holes should be
drilled. The location of the latter may be
established by direct layout after refer-
ence to the location of the tapped holes
in the mounting fixture.
The parallels should now be welded
into position by fillet welding. Although
cold rolled stock has been specified, any
suitable scrap that is lying around the
shop tan be used. The important thing is
to make sure that the parallels are placed
to furnish support where it is essential.
A heavier support has been used between
the piercing holes because supports can-
not be placed directly below these holes.
There are two other possible variations
worth mentioning here. The first would
be to substitute light weight channel iron
for the cold rolled stock. The feasibility
of this would depend upon how true the
web surface and the plane of the feet are
to being parallel. The second alternative
is to construct a web to be attached to the
base of the fixture. This web would per-
mit slug channels at standardized dis-
tances. This type of welded construction
is commonly used in plastic mold fabri-
cation.
Depending upon the particular shop
and the type of parts to be produced, con-
siderable savings are possible by using
one of these two variations.
The die should now be separated from
the punch, and the two stock guides made
from SAE 1020 welded into position by
fillet welding on the outside of the guides
only. These guides are located with re-
spect to the die holes. The distance be-
tween the guides should provide a slight
clearance for easy passage of the stock.
Examination of a sample piece of the
stock at this time will be beneficial in de-
termining the amount of clearance re-
quired. After welding the guides in place,
the punch and die components are ready
for flame hardening.
Flame Hardening
Two different types of flame hardening
torch heads are required for this opera-
tion. One type consists of the flame head
with a water jet to follow the flame; and
the other has an air jet for water and air
quenching respectively. Commercial units
are available for both of the former. The
desired hardening is readily obtainable by
allowing the torch to dwell until the area
under the flame is cherry red. The tori
should then be moved forward, simul-
taneously heating the next section and
quenching the previously heated arti
The proper relative hardness is easily
determined for the water quenched sur-
faces since they should be of maximum
hardness. After the surface has cooled,
lightly draw a file across the surface. It
the metal is easily scratched, it is too soft,
and the flame hardening process should
be repeated. The air quenching operation
is, of course, only a partial hardening and
hence the file test will not be suitable.
Generally if care is taken in heating the
pins, the desired hardness will be reached
very closely and the actual hardness will
be suitable. The advantage of this type of
process is threefold. First, with the type
of material used, very little dimensional
distortion is incurred during hardening
Second, most of the equipment is readily
available in the tool room and any gooci
mechanic can master the operation with
but little practice. Third, the operation is
quite economical. The estimated volume
of each oxygen and acetylene required is
one cubic foot per each four square inches
of surface, which is considerably less than
the cost of hardening the entire section in
a furnace.
The die is now complete except for
the installation of the rubber components.
The function of the rubber pads is to re-
place the use of a spring-loaded stripper
plate, which, in a conventional die, pro-
vides the required pressure to prevent the
stock from sticking to the punches dur-
ing the upstroke of the press. The strip-
ping pressure is commonly taken as six
percent of the blanking pressure. The
blanking pressure is a direct function of
the length of cutting, the metal thick-
ness, the amount of shear provided on
the punches (normally zero for small
diameter holes), and the shear strength
of the material. Although this value can
be computed, it is readily attainable from
standard nomographs, charts, etc.9
The exact amount of pressure attain-
able by using springs is readily deter-
mined, but unfortunately this is not the
case with rubber. The amount of pressure
attainable from rubber is dependent upon

Turbine for 'Copters
General Electrics small T58 gas tur-
bine engine is in advanced stages of de-
velopment for the Navy's Bureau of
Aeronautics and is rated in the "1000
horsepower class," it has been revealed by
a Company official.
Guy C. Shafer, General Manager of
G.E.'s Small Aircraft Engine Department,
Lynn, Mass., announced that the engine
will undergo extensive helicopter rotor
tests at the Company's Flight Test Cen-
ter in Schenectady, N.Y. in the near fu-
ture.
In discussing the new engine's fea-
tures, H. T. Hokanson, Manager of the
T58 Project, who is in charge of the
engine development program stated that
its light weight and small size are results
of G.E.'s advanced design techniques. He
also stated that the engine incorporates
the 'free" power turbine design, which
provides increased stability of operation
due to its favorable torcjue-speed charac-
teristic, and permits greater flexibility
in the selection of rotor speeds for greater
efficiency.
"The benefits which will accrue to
military users will be available to com-
mercial operators as well," Mr. Hokan-
son said. "They can look forward to
heavier payloads, higher flight speeds,
and better fuel economy."
Other advantages claimed for the new
gas turbine powerplant include installa-
tion flexibility and ease of maintenance.
According to Mr. Hokanson, an import-
ant factor in designing for these features
has been the wealth of gas turbine ex-
perience G-E has realized from the mil-
lions of operating hours logged by the
Company's J47 jet engines in military
aircraft.
Fuel versatility, another T58 advantage,
was gained by incorporating special de-
sign features which allow many types of
fuel to be used, easing the supply prob-
lem and resulting in lower operating
costs, Mr. Hokanson said.
He added that studies of anti-submar-
ine warfare, utility and cargo helicopter

at a much faster rate.
It is suggested that the installation of
the rubber be left to the shop mechanic,
as he can, by trial and error, cut the rub-
ber to the proper shapes and sizes. The
rubber is easily installed by gluing into
position with any high quality rubber
cement. The rubber should be placed so
that the pressure is more or less balanced
across the surface of the work.
For the first method of installing the
die in the press, the four rubber pads
(pressure clamps) are required for rigid-
ity as the press starts its downward stroke.
These pads are put in compression before
the punch contacts the work, thus pres-
sure-clamping the die in position. These
pads are not necessary for the second
method of die installation.
The die is now complete and ready
for installation in the press and a sample
parts run. The press should be brought
down slowly to close the die without any
stock in it for the first time to insure that
there is no interference. The first piece
from the die should be examined care-

edge will be observed to a depth of iboai

die clearance is properly adjusted.
The Advantage of Welding
This discussion on the construction of
the die is by no means complete in detail,
but it is hoped that it has stimulated the
reader's imagination as to the possibilities
of this type of design. The advantage of
welding lies primarily in the saving Of
machine time and the reduction in the
services required by a skilled diemaker.
In a conventional die, the various com-
ponents would be mounted by the use of
at least two dowels and two to four
screws for each member. This involves
boring holes for press-fitting the dowel
pins into one member and slip-fitting
them into the other member. This procesN
requires the services of a machinist as
well as a diemaker to fit each separate
piece properly into the final assembly.
After a man has had some experience, this
die can readily be fabricated without the
aid of a diemaker. For the sake of com-
parison, if this die were built in a con-
ventional manner, it would require ap-
proximately twenty-two dowels and fortv
socket head screws of assorted sizes in
its simplest form.
There is considerable saving in material
since the additional space for screws and
dowels is not required, thus making each
part more functional as far as size is con-
cerned. Of course, the investment in a
commercial or special die set is also saved.
For this particular design, an estimated
saving of one hundred dollars is possible.
Saving in Design and Tool Room Time
(Cost)
A specific table is given below showing
the estimated savings in time for the
various aspects of fabrication. Since the
figures are estimates, I have tried to make
them conservative. Some of the values
may be subject to critical questioning, but
at the end of this section an actual dollar
savings estimate is given.

The actual cost is estimated to be
$250.00 for this type as against $1200.00
for a conventional progressive die. The
estimate includes design and tryout time
and is again intended to be conservative.
It is felt, however, that the percent dollar
saving (79/r) is probably quite accurate.
What is the Expected Die Life?
As a positive statement, the expected
die life should be about 20r/f that of a
conventional die for the same part. The
die, if properly built should be capable of
producing about 30,000 parts without any
die maintenance. With careful resharpen-
ing of the die, it is entirely possible that
as many as 200,000 parts may be satis-
factorily produced. Certainly this type of
die is not suitable when the parts require-
ments are very high, such as they fre-
quently are in the automotive industry,
where they may reach several million.
Additional Advantage of Welded Dies
These dies are considerably lighter and
smaller in weight and size than their con-
ventional types. This can result in easing
the handling of materials and storage-
space requirements.
The equipment required for fabrica-
tion is less costly and simpler to use. As
previously mentioned, much less skill is
required of the personnel making the die.
The cost of the die can profitably be
amortized over fewer parts than could be
done with the conventional type. For ex-
ample, if the cost estimate for this die is
correct and if the number of pieces re-
quired is 10,000, the amortization cost
per piece would be 2.3 cents. Of course
this unit cost is high, but compare it with
the unit cost for the extra labor required
for "hand" fabrication or for amortizing
the cost of a conventional die for the
same number of parts.
Some Important Disadvantages
This type of construction is definitely
limited to the simpler type of forming
operations. Secondly, this type of con-
struction cannot be used for progressive
dies requiring a large number of stations,
although there is room for a lot of in-
genuity and imagination.
Because of the welded construction,
die maintenance (other than replacing
piercing punches) will be considerably
more difficult. This infers that more cart-
is required on the part of the operator
since jamming this die could result in ir-
reparable damage.
The thickness of stock that can be
used should be restricted to three thirty-
seconds (3/32) of an inch or less since
material heavier than this will result in
excessive loads on the small die mem-
bers and the welded seams.
As a direct result of technological im-
provements in arc welding and heat-treat-
ing methods, and in the manufacture of
alloy steels and synthetic rubber, the de-
sign presented in this paper has much to
offer organizations manufacturing low
quantities of given parts. The light weight
and the compact and economical con-
struction of this die would be impossible
without the availability of suitable weld-
ing means. This paper is by no means the
final answer to minimum cost production
of small metal stampings, but should
prove to be a strong stimulus for any-
one interested in this particular problem.
Definitions

enables a determination of the Mach
number directly through measurement of
the angle between an element of the
rocket nose cone and the direction of flow
of air over the nose cone when the rocket
is not moving with exactly zero angle of
attack, as generally is the case. Thus,
again, having determined the Mach num-
ber, the temperature is determined.
The other parameter, the wind, men-
tioned at the beginning of this paper, is
determined analytically through proper
interpretation of the Mach number, angle
of attack, rocket velocity, and surface flow
angle. The density is readily obtained
from the pressure and temperature data by
an elementary computation.
The smaller rockets, the Cajons, are
used in some cases rather than Aerobees
because they enable a simpler and less
costly experiment. As a result however,
the quantity of data obtained is some-
what reduced. To offset the reduction,
many more rockets will be launched per-
mitting many separate determinations of
these parameters, thus assisting in the
determination of likely seasonal and
diurnal variations of the pressure and
temperature. Correlation with other simi-
lar measurements and geophysical phe-
nomena is thus possible.
Similar equipment will be employed in
both rockets, differing essentially in quan-
tity such as Alphatron pressure measure-
ment system, "wind vanes" for surface
flow angle measurement, and associated
items, including control circuits, transis-
tor power supplies, and batteries. There
will be, in addition, electronic items for
transmitting scientific data to the ground
for recording, and for determining the
position of the rocket during its flight.
Thus each rocket will be in effect a
complete instrument for the determination
of data of scientific importance. Reference
to the accompanying photographs will
assist in visualizing these devices.
In conclusion it should be noted that
although participation in the IGY pro-
gram stems from experience in the gen-
eral field of rocket sounding of the upper
air, many students of the engineering
school are participating to varying de-
grees, and are thus afforded an opportun-
ity to have more direct contact with the
International Geophysical Year program,
an undertaking of very great scientific im-
portance.

"Nobody knows. It's ERNIE. The crazy

"You mean a break-down?"
"We don't know. All the circuits seem
to be in order. It just won't answer ques-
tions at all."
"That's funny," Myers said.
"General Wiethall's roaring. He's bel-
lowing at everybody, Well, make it

the information processed for the rocket
program."
"ERNIE must be having a bad day
again."
"No. It's something more than that.
It usually answers some questions. But
now it won't do anything."
"It's holding up the whole rocket pro-
gram, huh?"
"You're not kidding. Come on. Go
take a look at ERNIE with me. I want to
see if there's any change."
"It really sounds queer. I don't get this
at all."
They walked down the hall to the great
room containing the information ex-
changer.
The second man opened the door.
"Look at it."
Myers did look at it. The two tower-
ing panels looked the same way they did
the hundred times before when Myers
had come in the room. But the five lights
on the control panel were not flashing
as they usually were. They seemed to be
frozen. Two on, three off. Then Myers
noticed that little by little the first one
was going out and the second was be-
ginning to glow.
"Something is wrong," Myers said.
"I've never seen anything like that be-
fore."

They walked over to the control panel.
The dials indicated nothing wrong.
"Hasn't ERNIE written anything?"

"I wonder if this has anything to Co
with the machine's actions lately?
"You mean the Til kill you' bit?"
"Yes. And the fairy tale."
"You might have something there.
Myers said. "I think it is connected."

office.
"I'd like to see Mr. Williams," Myers
told the secretary.
"Certainly." The secretary pressed the

"You can go in now, Mr. Myers."
"Oh, hello, I've been wanting to set
you," Williams said. "Sit down. First
what was on your mind."
"Probably the same thing that was on

"That's right. What do you make of
it?"
"Well, I think it really meant those
statements about killing everyone," Myers
said.
"That's very hard to accept."
"I know. But it would explain his ac-
tions. You see, ERNIE for some reason
wants to destroy the human race. He's
found a way to do it, or at least thinks
he has, and now that he's accomplished
what he wanted to do, he can relax."

"The unpredictability factor. But for it
to suddenly come to the conclusion it
wants to kill, this is slightly preposterous
isn't it?"
"Anything's possible inside of a Nchr-
man information exchanger."
"It reminds me of the Victorian mon-
ster novels about robots stalking the coun-
try-side. But this is real life."
"That's my guess about it though."
"Then again, why would the informa-
tion exchanger tell us about it's plans?
If it really is the evil intelligence, the
so utterly logical killer that you're sug-
gesting, then the last thing it would
ever do would be to let the cat out of the
bag. Why would it tell us its plans of
murdering us?"
"Maybe that's ERNIE's equivalent of a
sense of humor. Maybe it's playing a
sort of game with us. Maybe it knows
there's nothing we can do to stop it
now."
"More of the unpredictability factor,
that's what it boils down to so far. Well,
though it's pretty far out, I'll admit your
theory holds together so far. But there's
one final point."
"I know what you're going to say.
How can ERNIE kill us?'"
"That's right. The information ex-
changer can't kill us. There's no conceiv-
able way it could."
"But you can't be sure," Myers said.
"Can you think of a way?"
"No."
"Of course you can't. Look at the pic-
ture. It's impossible: The information ex-
changer is not a physical machine, it's
an informational machine. It cannot per-
form any physical actions, any more than
an automobile can perform higher mathe-
matics. You see, this is where the picture
of the information exchanger as a Frank-
enstein breaks down. The Frankenstein
robot was the type of perverted informa-
tion exchanger you're describing ERNIE
as. But it also had a physical plant, a
that if any 'mind' thinks of it, the laws
of the universe break down."
"Oil, Myers, be sensible. Pure thought
destroying the universe!"
"I guess that is beyond the realm of
possibility."
"Of course it is. Theoretically, the
molecules in any liquid could be consid-
ered a non-integrated informational ma-
chine. With all the liquid bodies that
have ever existed in the universe, surely
every thought ERNIE could ever con-
ceive has already been conceived before."
"OK, let's drop that idea."
"Well, we were just asking what sort
of physical instrument ERNIE could
make use of to carry out his intentions.
Let's consider that."
"How about man?"
"You mean us. We're the only people
in contact with him. But what can he do?
Hypnotize us? Any hypnosis of the sort
by another person is fantastic. But hypno-
sis by ERNIE: it would have to be car-
ried out by his only instrument of com-
munication: its typewritten. Now tell me

Myers, surely you don't believe there
could be such a thing as hypnosis by
typewriter, do you?"
"No."
"All right, that takes care of man as
his instrument of action. What else does
the information exchanger have left."
"I don't know."
"Nothing. ERNIE has no way of doing
anything to us. The most impotent micro-
organism in the world is more dangerous
to us than ERNIE."
"I still have a feeling ERNIE has hit
upon something."
"Look here, Myers. We've considered
the only two possible, no, only two con-
ceivable, ways ERNIE could accomplish
a physical change outside itself. One: by
mental power alone. But this theory ob-
viously doesn't hold water. And two: by
influencing some physical agent. The only
agent available to do ERNIE's bidding a
man. But, upon closer examination th;»
too is not possible."
"I see. So my hunch falls apart.
"It does. Quite conclusively. It's totally
implausible."
"Well, I guess that's that," Myers
said.

Myers paced the grounds in front or
the building. He smoked a cigarette.
And another . . . soon he had finished
the pack. He started for the project store
to buy a pack.
Then a wild idea hit him.
He turned back and ran toward the
main building. He ran up the hall to the
laboratory containing ERNIE.
He went up to the electric typewriter
and sat behind it.
Given, he typed out, a being complete-
ly separated from the world, let it be
blind, deaf, and dumb, with no physics
power, except that it can communicate in-
formation.
Given, that this being intends to de-
stroy another type of being who is no:
blind, deaf, nor dumb and has physical
power, and that the first being can com-
municate with the second.
What possible method can the first
being employ to destroy the second?
Myers finished typing. The machine
had never been asked such a semantic
question before. Myers did not know
what was going to happen.
The lights on the control panel came
to life, flickering excitedly. They almost
appeared to twinkle at Myers.
Then ERNIE began typing.
There is a solution to suggested prob-
lem, the typewriter wrote.
And I have employed that solution al-
ready.
Then the typewriter halted. Myers
waited.
Finally he typed out, his hands hardly
able to hit the keys, What is that solution?
Myers waited. There was no response.
He typed the question again. ERNIE
did not want to answer.
What is the answer? he typed out
again, but ERNIE remained quiet.
Myers pulled the page out of the type-
writer and threw it on the floor.

"For example," Mr. Hokanson said,
"in an anti-submarine warfare mission
where endurance is an important factor, a
given T57-powercd helicopter could stay
aloft 50 per cent longer than a piston

to carry payload a given distance is the
prime consideration, as in a cargo heli-

Mr. Hokanson expects the T58 to en-
able a utility helicopter to carry 100 per
cent more payload than a piston engine
powered helicopter.
The turboshaft T58, with some modi-
fication, can be converted to a turboprop
or turbojet.
The Department is also developing a
small turbojet engine designated MX-
2273, for the Air Force.

near Cincinnati.
Data Digester
An advanced measurement technique,
now being used at the General Electric
Company's jet engine plant near Cin-
cinnati, is proving useful in understand-
ing mechanical and aerodynamic phe-
nomena in jet engines and in perfecting
designs of advanced propulsion systems.
Called a magnetic tape recording and
data reduction system, it is used in the
Materials Laboratory of the Company's
Aircraft Gas Turbine Development De-
partment. Total recall of data is made
possible by magnetic tape storage, and
subsequent reduction and analysis is ef-
fected electronically.
With the system, multiple channels of
data such as stress, vibration, pressure,
temperature, speed and flow, can be re-
corded simultaneously at a test site. The
data may be steady in nature or varying
up to 30,000 cycles per second.
Data reduction is accomplished by this
complex electronic system (shown above)
designed and constructed by G-E engi-
neers. Use of this equipment has short-
ened data reduction time to a fraction of
what was previously required.
Reduction of the data is performed in
multiple channels. Presentation of the
data can be made by utilizing function
78
plotters, direct writing oscillographs, con-
tinuous recording in terms of instantan-
eous amplitude and frequency, and by
cathode ray oscilloscopes and oscillo-
graphs. Flexibility of the equipment pro-
vides a wide choice in ways of studying
many types of data.
New Atom-smasher design
from U. of M.
Ann Arbor—"Bunches" of atomic par-
ticles racing around a ten-foot circle five
million times in one second this week
gave physicists at The University of
Michigan their first proof of a new
theory for "atom smasher" design. The
particles, electrons, were whirled to these
high speeds in a one-ton "table-top"
model accelerator built in the Phoenix
Memorial Laboratory. Physicists here have
hailed the event as proof that magnets of
revolutionary design within the model
are properly guiding the particles in
their circular orbits.
The new magnets can simultaneously
guide particles at various stages of ac-
celeration, and can operate continuously
on direct current. The result is a simpli-
fied machine that gives promise of in-
creasing its production of atomic particles
100 times over existing accelerators.
The design is to be used in an ultrj-
high energy atom smasher scheduled to
be built in the Midwest by the Midwest
ern Universities Research Association, jr.
organization of 14 institutions that have
pooled their resources for the project
which, as of last month, has the backing
of the Atomic Energy Commission.

sign was conceived by Dr. Keith M.

METALLURGICAL
ENGINEERING
The development of better gas turbines, more flex-
ible electronic circuits, higher performance aircraft,
and new constructional materials depends heavily
upon advances in metallurgy.
As an example of one of these advances in the gas
turbine field, the above electron micrograph at 12,000
diameters illustrates the structure of a new nickel-
aluminum-titanium alloy which is stronger at elevated
temperatures, as well as cheaper and lower in stra-
tegic metals than the cobalt base material in current
use. It was necessary to view this alloy through the
electron microscope in order to reveal the very fine precipitate of Ni.,(Al,Ti) which is responsible for the high
strength.
To provide the student with a suitable background to participate in similar developments of new alloys, the
metallurgy program has three important divisions of study.
1. A thorough grounding in physics, chemistry and mathematics as well as basic courses in other engineer-
ing fields is necessary for a broad understanding of the problems of others.
2. Process Metallurgy deals with the production of metals and alloys from ore, scrap or other raw materials
and the methods of casting, welding or shaping them into useful components.
3. Physical Metallurgy provides an understanding of the relation of atomic structure and microstructure to the
control and improvement of physical properties.
A unique feature of the metallurgical program at Michigan is the widespread employment of students at all
levels in professional type work. This close cooperative effort with the faculty on problems of international interest
provides a valuable supplement to the formal education. A variety of combined programs with other branches of
science and engineering are also available.

"I have some nice hot soup for din-

"Thanks."
He picked up the paper. Same old
stories. Politics and more politics.
Strangely, there were five or six stories
about more cranks threatening to destroy
the world.
He went into the dining room and
started eating.
He stirred his soup without speaking.
Suddenly he dropped his spoon.
"Destroy—the—earth," he whispered.
"What is it dear?" Mrs. Myers said.
Myers did not answer. He sat look-
ing dumbly into space for a moment, then
got up slowly.
He went into the other room and be-
gan rummaging through some periodicals.
He paged through a mathematical jour-
nal, found what he wanted, and sat down.
"What's the matter, dear?" Mrs.
Myers asked from the dining room.
"Please, don't disturb me for a little
while. I've got to figure this out."
He sat working over the equations with
pencil and paper for a long time. Then,
seeing what he wanted, he sat back and
closed his eyes.
His wife stood in the doorway. "Is it
all right if I come in?" she said.
"Yes."
"What is it? You look as white as a

"I have the answer for the question I

"The information exchanger that I

"All those people, all those cranks

"With U. S. Steel, my future holds interest,
challenge and reward."
From his graduation in 1948 with a
B.S. degree in Mechanical Engineer-
ing, until November of that year,
Edward Stolic worked as an operat-
ing trainee in the Irvin Works of
United States Steel. Following his
discharge from the Army in 1950,
he returned to work at U.S. Steel. In
just 18 months, Mr. Stolic reached a
management position as Engineer-
Lubrication.
By mid-year 1953, Mr. Stolic was
promoted to Foreman-Instrument
Repair and Sub-Station. In a recent
interview he said: "Opportunities
for rapid advancement are almost
limitless in U.S. Steel." At 27, Mr.
Stolic is supervising a force of 30
men in mechanical and electrical
tests as well as instrument repair and
maintenance of gas generators, com-
pressors and water purification units.
He feels that, "The engineer finds
many places to apply the knowledge
he garnered in school." The men un-
der Edward Stolic are called on to
trouble shoot in any part of the mill.
This calls for a wide variety of tal-

A MILLION IDEAS
AVIATION CORPORATION
Bendix ELECTRO-SPAN provides telemeter control
of industrial operations from hundreds of miles away
Important storage reservoirs for water,
crude oil, gas, brine and other liquids
are located in many remote and isolated
sections of this country. In the past it
has required crews of men stationed at
these points to keep a constant check
on volumes and to open and close
valves to balance supply and demand.
The work is lonely, expensive to main-
tain, and sometimes dangerous.
Now Bendix electro-span, made by
Pacific Division of Bendix Aviation
Corporation in North Hollywood, Cali-
fornia, can take over the entire job. It's
a completely automatic, remote meas-
uring and control system that takes
measurements in oil storage tanks,
controls flow in water systems, com-
pletely operates unattended power and
weather observation stations—all from
a central location. Liquid level, flow,
temperature, electrical quantities, pres-
sure or shaft position are types of
information which electro-span de-
livers immediately.
The system also acts in reverse,
enabling the operator to control pumps,
valves, motors and circuit breakers at
remote locations. It can be used over
any communication link such as tele-
phone or telegraph lines, radio or
microwave.
electro-span is just another of the
million Bendix ideas to be converted
into a vital product for American
industry. It is because of exciting, new
products like this that talented engi-
neers find a job with Bendix a challeng-
ing and stimulating experience. Then,
too, they know that Bendix combines
the opportunities of a large corporation
with the advantages of small, autono-
mous divisions where skill and in-
genuity are never overlooked. No
matter what part of the country you
prefer, Bendix deserves your attention
when you plan your engineering future.

Dear Mr. Levin:
The "small minded" co-ed, as referred to in
your past editorial, finds it impossible to resist
answering. I must say, however, that there were
so many discrepancies in your thought process
that the task of correcting you seemed almost
futile.
For the clarity of your readers, let us state
the cause of our dissention. I believe that a
more comprehensive education is being sacri-
ficed for Engineering School's technical and
specialized curriculum. A brief glance at your
bulletin will reveal that there is only one course
required which could fit into this category. I
find this adequate enough proof to support my
statement.
Now that I have dispensed with your to-
tally inadequate argument, we can get on to
significant matters. You have made your choice
and I have made mine. It would be chalked off
to "to each his own", but this would not be
facing the issue. Let us proceed from the as-
sumption that the purpose of higher education
is to broaden one's mind in some way or an-
other. You must agree that Lit. School provides
a very broad education "designed to provide
the student with an educational experience that
will enlarge his capacity for the enjoyment of
living and will equip him to bear more suc-
cessfully his responsibilities in succeeding
years." You and your fellow students. Mr.
Levin will be facing the world knowing only of
how long it takes to pick up a nail. Granted
that this knowledge will be important in your
vocation, but there are other equally important
parts of life to be understood and enjoyed. If
I could be convinced that a large number of
Engine students are aware of this, and not so
inclined in one direction, then there would be
no disagreement. But, the courses not applying
directly to Engineering are shrugged off as ir-
relevant. They are just as valuable as tools to
the other parts of life as your Engine courses
to your vocation. Something is lacking if stu-
dents fail to realize that the world doesn't re-
volve around their vocation—that life doesn't
run in one direction, but that it has to be under-
stood from many sides in order to live peace-
fully in it, whether we be Sociologists or Engi-
neers.
Ed: After a "brief" gance at the engineering
bulletin our coed found only one course of a broad
nature required and thus concluded her case was
won. This I might have expected as "brief glances
seem to be the way Lit school students study. If she
had read the bulletin more intensively, she could
have found that the average program has at least
8 required non-technical courses and no limit to the
number of non-techs an engineer could take if he
so desires. Also she would have noticed several co-
operative programs which allow a student to spend
3 years in Lit. school and 2 in Eng. school.
As far as engineers knowing only how long it
takes to pick up a nail, if this is her idea of what
we study, she needs to take a few Engine school
courses to straighten out her ideas. Besides, we
could use some more pretty co-eds in engine school
to help broaden our views.

On Boeing B-52 bombers, the hori-
zontal tail surface has more area than the
wing of a standard twin-engine airliner.
Yet it can be moved in flight, up or down,
to trim the aircraft.
The device that performs this function
is a jack screw, which, though it weighs
only 255 pounds, can exert a force of
approximately 225 tons I
Many kinds of engineering skills went
into designing and developing a jack
screw so precise that it automatically com-
pensates for stretch and compression
under load. Civil, electrical, mechanical
and aeronautical engineers, and mathe-
maticians and physicists — all find chal-
lenging work on Boeing design projects
for the B-52 global jet bomber, and for
the 707 jet tanker-transport, the BO-
MARC IM-99 pilotless interceptor, and
aircraft of the future.
Because of Boeing's steady expansion,
there is continuing need for additional
engineers. There are more than twice as
many engineers with the company now
as at the peak of World War II. Because
Boeing is an "engineers' company," and
promotes from within, these men find
unusual opportunities for advancement.
Design engineers at Boeing work with
other topnotch engineers in close-knit
project teams. They obtain broad experi-
ence with outstanding men in many
fields, and have full scope for creative
expression, professional growth and indi-
vidual recognition. And they find satis-
faction in the high engineering integrity
that is a Boeing byword.
In addition to design engineering,
there are openings on other Boeing teams
in research and production. Engineers
like the life in the "just-right" size com-
munities of Seattle and Wichita. They
may pursue advanced studies with com-
pany assistance in tuition and participate
in a most liberal retirement plan. There
may be a place for you at Boeing-Seattle
or Boeing-Wichita.

AN HOUR -
By RICHARD MIKTON '57 LS&amp;A
In this automated engine as-
sembly line oil is automati-
cally applied to cylinder
and valve lifter holes before
cylinder heads are assem-
bled. Note pistons, pump
housings and oil pan have al-
ready been assembled.
The impact of automation on the mod-
ern American industrial scene has no-
where been felt more strongly than it has
in the automobile industry. The produc-
tion of various automobile components
has undergone radical transformations
over the past 5 to 10 years. Rear axle
housings, transmission cases, intake and
exhaust manifolds, and most important,
engine blocks, are only a few of an
automobile's many parts whose process-
ing has been greatly affected by the magic
of automation.
But exactly what does 'automation'
mean? It has been tossed around by every-
one who sets out to describe American
industry today. Much confusion results
from each industry's interpreting 'auto-
mation' differently. In the railroad indus-
try, it has one definite usage, while in the
petroleum industry it means something
quite different. The same is true in the
automobile industry. Here automation is
used to mean "the automatic handling of
parts between progressive productive
processes."
Evolution
With such a definition, the applica-
tion of automation obviously begins with
the elimination of work handling. Thus,
automation was probably originated years
ago by the man who first conceived the
idea of placing two tools on a lathe car-
riage to cut two diameters at one time.
From this embryonic stage, automation
has evolved markedly, until today a typi-
cal automation system incorporates the
operations of many scores of individual
machines into one mammoth machine con-
trolled by a single operator.
The many implications of this remark-
able evolution have created labor and pro-
duction problems that superficially brand
automation as more of an evil than a
good. But a true understanding of auto-
mation readily shows that automation is
another inevitable step in the advancing
technological age.
This article will attempt to convey an
understanding of automation in the auto-
mobile industry by tracing the recent de-
velopment of the concept, by clarifying
details of a typical automation system,
and, finally, by describing two recent ex-
amples of automation machinery used in
the production of V8 automobile engine
blocks,
The development of automation has
proceeded along very definite lines. The
idea of placing two tools on a lathe car-
riage to cut two diameters at one time
soon gave way to many kinds of single-
station machines using multiple and com-
bination tooling. These are the machines
that simultaneously perform more than
one operation on a single workpiece. Ex-
amples of these are multiple-slide lathes,
multiple-spindle drill presses, two-way
three-way, and four-way drilling and bor-
ing machines, multiple spindle milling
machines, etc.
Combination tools were developed to
a high degree along with single-station

combination drilling, multiple diameter
boring, form turning, milling and many
other operations.
But these single-station machines have
their drawbacks. Because some of these
machines have numerous heads coming
in from all directions, it is very difficult to
load and unload the work pieces in the
fixtures. Also, the changing of tools is a
major operation.
The Big Step
To alleviate these conditions, multiple
station machines were developed. The first
machines of this kind were the dial type
and trunnion type. In these machines,
workpieces are placed in fixtures which
are attached to index tables or trunnions.
Parts are indexed from station to station.
In each station, multiple drilling- tapping,
milling, and similar operations are per-
formed. One station is always reserved
for the loading and unloading of the
workpiece, thus performing this time con-
suming operation simultaneously with the
cutting in the other stations.
But the dial and trunnion types still
did not provide the whole answer to the
problem of cutting down the handling of
the workpieces, which is actually the heart
of automation's purpose. The dial and
trunnion types brought more operations
together than did single-station machines,
but their many drawbacks spurned the
search for more efficient designs. These
drawbacks have their root in the practical
limit of the diameter of the table or
trunnion of the particular machine. The
larger the table, the greater the indexing
error. Because the table size is limited, the
number of stations is limited.
This demand for machines with more
stations led to the development of mul-
tiple station machines, wherein stations
are stretched out in a straight line. These
Pallet-type transfer machine. Here parts are clamped in fixtures
and the fixtures are transferred from station to station.
are transfer machines: and until now,
they represent the most highly developed
application of the automation principle
in machine tools. Transfer machines fall
into two general types; the pallet type
and the plain type.
In the pallet-type machines, parts are
clamped in fixtures and the fixtures are
transferred from station to station. After
the operations are completed, the pallet
fixtures return via a conveyor to the load-
ing station where parts are unloaded and
replaced with unfinished parts. The fix-
tures then resume their journey through
the machining operations. Pallet machines
are used where it is frequently necessary
to change over from one part to another;
and also in single purpose applications
where the part has an irregular shape, as
does a flywheel housing.
In the plain type transfer machine the
parts are placed in the loading station,
and from here they are transferred from
station to station. At the end of the
machine they are ejected. Parts are lo-
cated and clamped separately in each sta-
tion. Thus, in the plain type machine,
more problems are encountered in the de-
sign of location and holding fixtures than
are presented by the pallet machine,
which only uses a stationary part in a
moving fixture.
Theoretically, transfer machines offer
limitless possibilities for combining op-
erations. Today, machines are being de-
signed and built that incorporate auto-
matic positioning devices as well as
cleaning, inspection, and assembly opera-

tions. As advanced as today's machines
are over the two tools on a lathe carriage
of 30 years ago, so will tomorrow's ma-
chines make today's seem insignificant by
comparison.
Controls
As seen in the two photographs of
transfer machines, the complexity of an
automation system increases with its
length. The fact that transfer machines
are designed to be operated by one or
two unskilled workers means that simplic-
ity and infallibility in its control are the
keynote in its design. One central push-
button station provides the operator with
a means of checking on the progress of
every operation throughout the machine.
Should a drill head fail to disengage and
retract to its normal position following
the completion of its operation, the ma-
chine will refuse to cycle the workpieces
to the next station. Instead, the operator
is warned by a red light on the pushbut-
ton station. It is his job to see that the
trouble is cleared up before the machine
continues its cycling of the workpieces. A
vast array of warning devices such as this
one prevents the machine from being
damaged by the failure of its own com-
ponents. Thus the operator's job does not
require much thinking. The brain of an
automation system, the electrical control
panel, makes any transfer machine, re-
gardless of length, safe and simple to
operate.
The components that compose an auto-
mation system may be placed in three
categories: mechanical, electrical, and
hydraulic. Combinations of these are used
throughout the design of a transfer ma-
chine. For instance, an electrical timer
sends a signal to a solenoid, which in
turn, having been energized, actuates a
hydraulic valve. The valve opens and oil
under heavy pressure (500-800 psi)
moves the piston in the hydraulic cylin-
der. The piston provides the power with
which the drill head moves forward on its
carriage, engaging the workpiece and
drilling holes to a predetermined depth.
It is impossible to say which of these
categories is the most important. Each is
dependent upon the other two in some
direct way. Of course, without electrical
power, the hydraulic pumps could not
operate; but then again, without hydrau-
lics, the entire automation system would
be inoperative. Thus, in understanding
the operation of a transfer machine, each
of these three categories merits careful
consideration.
World War II
It should be added that automation has
evolved in close parallel to the develop-
ment of hydraulics and electro-mechani-
cal devices. The impetus given to hydrau-
lics by the Second World War is largely
responsible for automation's early ad-
vances in 1947 and 1948. Before the war,
horizontal and vertical movements in
machine tools were largely performed
by lead screws and other purely mechani-
cal devices. This resulted in rapid de-
terioration of the machine. Tolerances
were difficult to maintain also.
But with the introduction of hydraulics,
all the former problems and disadvantages
disappeared. From this day forward,
automation began its rapid growth. There
is a lesson to be learned from this ex-
perience. With the present advances in
electronics and their applications in in-
dustry, an entire new era for automation
could well be in the offering. Needless to
say, the designers and automation engi-
neers are not overlooking this fact.
Downtime
The engineer with an imagination, up-
on considering the many devices at his
disposal for designing an automation sys-
tem, will attempt to design a machine that
combines a great number of operations.
Theoretically, as it was said earlier, trans-
fer machines offer limitless possibilities
for combining operations. But, unfortun-
ately, there is a practical limit to the

amount of operations that can be com-
bined. This practical limit is downtime—
or the time during which the machine h
inoperative for one reason or another.
Downtime in production was never
very cumulative until the advent of trans-
fer machines and their great numbers of
operations. Previous to automation, the
downtime on one machine had little effect
on the operation and production of an-
other machine. But combining these oper-
ations in an automated machine means
that every delay occurring at one part of
the machine will shut down the other
parts of the machine. It is the reduction
of this downtime and the increasing of i
machine's efficiency that offers the ma-
chine designer the greatest challenge in
the future.
There are two basic classifications of
downtime. The first is predictable down-
time, such as time for changing tools,
cleaning a machine, etc. The memovaland
resharpening of tools means that the ma-
chine must remain idle for a relatively
long period. In high production factories,
entire production schedules and weekly
output can be influenced by seemingly
insignificant shutdowns of transfer ma-
chinery.
Consider a multiple station transfer
machine employing 120 tools that need
changing every 4 hours. If the tool change
is 2 minutes per tool, then the total time
to change all tools is 240 minutes, or 4
hours. In other words, the machine will
produce for 4 hours, and then will be
down 4 hours for tool changing. If the
number of tools is increased to 240, the
downtime doubles; if the number is in-
creased to 3^0, the downtime triples, etc.
Tool Programming
This problem of tool changing down-
time is partially solved by automatic tool
Unit 'H' mechanically inspects
the oil gallery holes and shuts
down Section I if they are un-
satisfactory. Unit 'U' pressure
tests the oil gallery holes and
sprays a spot of paint onto the
block if defective. It is then sal-
vaged at the end of the line.
Parts can be removed at any
station.

With the part moving from right to left, the bank
faces are drilled, after which the parts are lifted and
rotated 360° in Station 6 to dump the chips. In Sta-
tion 7, all holes are probed. If the part does not pass

programming and the development of
new automatic work-handling devices.
Tool programming may be defined as the
scheduling of tool operation from the
time the tool is put to work in the ma-
chine until it is removed for resharpening.
Automatic tool programming is es-
pecially needed in transfer machines
when it is considered that tools, once
under close observation in single-station
machines, are now far removed from the
immediate personal attention in transfer
machines. Because of the inconsistency of
tool performance and other variables, the
first requirement of any programming de-
vice is flexibility.
Overall, or master, programming of all
the tools in a machine is impractical. Too
many interruptions occur to disrupt the
master program and it takes too long to
develop an alternative program once there
is an interruption. The solution is auto-
matic tool programming for each indi-
vidual tool.
The basic unit in this tool program-
ming is a mechanical memory device that
counts the number of operations a tool
performs while it is working in the ma-
chine. These counters are centralized, en-
abling the operator, or production person-
nel, to tell at a glance what tools are
nearing the end of their produc-
tion life. After each tool completes
its specified number of operations, the me-
chanical memory automatically shuts
down the machine for a tool change.
Tools that are completely dulled, and
those nearing the end of their life, are all
replaced; thus removing the necessity of
shutting down the machine soon after-
wards.
The Big Machine
Early in 1954, the many problems of
automation were brought to a head in de-
termining the design of a single transfer
machine to do the machining of a V8
automobile engine block. This was the
first time a single automation system was
considered for a V8 block. Previously, 4
and 6 cylinder engine blocks had been
processed by a single automation system,
but never had been a V8 block.
That such a machine could be designed
was a foregone conclusion. The single
factor influencing the design and execu-
tion of such a transfer machine was the
problem of downtime. It was realized
that any such machine would be over
three hundred feet long. The two banks
of cylinders in the V8 block called for a
double line of operations, operations on
both faces simultaneously. In effect, this
meant that nearly 700 feet of machinery,
using over 500 individual tools, would
present an unbelievably large tool pro-
gramming problem.
A single transfer machine appeared to
be out of the question. The time and
money consumed in replacing the tools in
a single machine would offset the high
production rate of the machine when it
was running. The most logical way of
overcoming this problem of downtime
was to divide the machine into sections,
thus permitting the shutting down of
certain sections without interrupting the
automatic cycle of the others.
Sectionized automation has called for
two levels of transfer movements—a pri-
mary and a secondary transfer mechanism.
All primary units work simultaneously
and transfer the parts forward from sta-
tion to station within the sections. The
secondary units move the parts from
section to section during the time the
tools are cutting.
Sectionized automation in this machine
works in the following manner. If, for
example, it is necessary to shut down
Section 3 to change one of the tools, the
mechanical memory device controlling the
dull tool terminates the cycle of Section
3, but Sections 1, 2, 4 and 5 remain in
full automatic operation. The operator
continues to feed parts into Section 1
without interruption. Cylinder blocks
coming out of Section 2 are banked up in
front of Section 3, while the parts behind
Section 3 are fed into Section 4. After the
tool setter replaces the full tool with a
fresh one, he resets the memory device
and Section 3 returns to automatic opera-
tion in sequence with the other sections.
In this way, sectionized automation mini-
mizes lost production during periods of
downtime.
Only One Man
At 100% efficiency, meaning that all
five sections are in operation at once, the
machine processes 100 V8 cylinder
blocks hourly. The cost of this 350 auto-
mation system is not excessive when it is
considered that this single transfer ma-
chine performs 555 operations. Broken
down, these operations are 265 drilling,

Section III, Section I, and placed in car position.
6 milling, 21 boring, 56 reaming, 101
countersinking, 106 tapping, and 133 in-
spection. The machine handles 104 blocks
simultaneously in 104 stations; each block
is handled in seven different positions
while being processed. The 104 stations
include: 1 for loading, 53 for machining,
7 for part handling, 6 for mechanical in-
spection, 36 for visual inspection, and 1
for unloading.
Many novel features are incorporated
in this automation system. For instance,
should a cylinder block be damaged
while being processed, each station is
built so that the block can be removed
without any difficulty. High pressure oil
holes in the block are automatically test-
ed with air pressure. Before all holes are
tapped, they are automatically inspected
for depth.
Because of the great amount of metal
removed from the cylinder block, pro-
visions are made throughout the machine
for the rapid removal of chips from the
machine parts. A conveyor beneath the
machine carries these chips away from
the working area. In practically every type
of automation system, from trunnion
type to sectionized automation, much care
is given to the removal of chips. The
second type of downtime, that of the un-
predictable sort, usually results from
breakdowns caused by chip accumulations
and other shortcomings in design.
The success of sectionized automation
in this machine has caused widespread ac-
ceptance of the banking method as a
means of reducing downtime. The high
production of engine blocks in this case,
by only one man and a machine, shows
very definitely that the miracle of automo-
tion is another important step forward
in making America the industrial giant
of the world.
And Non-Assembly!
Until very recently, automation was
used by the automobile industry only in
the machining of components. But with
the lessons learned from building many
diverse types of machines to process a
large variety of work, the builders of
transfer machines felt that the principle
of automation could be easily adapted to
assembly operations. Consequently, a large
automobile manufacturer ordered a final

engine assembly line, built on the auto-
mation principle. This development in
the automobile industry is more than
noteworthy. It is something revolutionary,
especially when its implications for the
near and distant future are carefully ex-
amined.
Two primary reasons motivated the
building of this automated assembly line.
First, worker fatigue on an assembly line,
especially on an engine line, is very great.
But with an automated line, back-break-
ing labor is eliminated. No longer must
a worker lift and carry heavy parts from
one point to another. The 565 foot three
section assembly line is paralleled by two
similar type cylinder head assembly ma-
chines, each 120 feet long. Completed
cylinder heads are fed to the final assem-
bly line by a conveyor. From here they are
unloaded, located on the engine, and then
fastened down. Formerly this job was per-
formed by hand, meaning numerous ac-
cidents and much hard labor. The auto-
mated line does away with this and many
other similar dangerous and heavy jobs.
The second motivation for this line was
the desire for mechanized assembly of en-
gines that would achieve a uniform speci-
fied torque on all belts, screws, and nuts
automatically, without the possibility of
human failure. The cylinder heads on a
V8 engine must be tight enough to elim-
inate leaks, but not so tight as to warp
the head or cause fatigue in the studs or
nuts. Multi-spindle nut runners, driven by
air motors, achieve this uniform torque
without relying on the workers' judgment.
A higher quality engine is one of the
automated line's many advantages.
Semi-Automated
As can be seen in the drawing, all
operations are not being mechanized im-
mediately. While some operations are
fully automatic, others remain manual.
Some operations may never be made
automatic. But at each station of the ma-
chine there are face plates on the machine
base that are machined, ground, and drill-
ed accurately for rapid installation or re-
moval of the assembling units. As more
automatic assembly devices are developed
in the future, they will be fastened onto
the base, replacing a worker with an auto-
matic operation.
At the beginning of the assembly line
an overhead conveyor brings the cylinder
block from the inspection unit at the end
of the block line. The block is then low-
ered and positioned on a pallet that car-
ries it down the automated line. The en-
gine is accurately located on the pallet by
means of special locating pads provided
in the design of the block casting.
The pallets are indexed from station to
station by a transfer bar that runs the
length of each of the three machine sec-
tions. This bar is actuated by hydraulic
cylinders. It is equipped with dogs that
engage each pallet and pull it from a dis-
tance of four feet to its approximate posi-
tion at the next station. A second bar
moves a short distance to actuate a shot-
pin that registers in a locating hole in the
pallet and positions it longitudinally to
within about 0.005" accuracy. The dogs
are then disengaged by the long transfer
bar rotating 30° and then returning to
position.
A special hydraulic valving arrange-
ment allows pallets transferring from
station to station to undergo a slow ac-
celeration and deceleration for operator
safety. Thus, in the event that there are
hand power tools being used on the line,
the operator can safely finish his opera-
tion if incomplete at the time the ma-
chine begins to index. The pallets are at-
tached to a chain which returns the pal-
lets from the final station through a tun-
nel beneath the machine base to the be-
ginning of the line.
Sub-Assemblies
The typical clutter around assembly
lines is missing around this automated
line because stockpiling is done in out-
lying areas of the plant. All parts and sub-
assemblies are brought to the line by
conveyor, as needed. For example, all

head bolts are tightened to a pre-
determined torque. In this auto-
mated engine assembly line, oil is
automatically applied to cylinders
and valve lifter holes before cylin-
der heads are assembled. Note the
pistons in their firing order.

Chairman, Department of Production Engineering
TOOL ENGINEERING a brand new
This paper discussed the university's
procedure and purpose in planning a
curriculum for training tool engineers
for industry in general. The university I
represent operates under a governing
Board of Regents and a President. It is an
involved structure. Curricula are the re-
sponsibility of the faculties of several
divisions, known as colleges, for under-
graduate work, and schools for graduate
work. The College of Engineering has
some nine budgeted departments such as
Civil, Electrical, Mechanical Engineering,
etc., each with a chairman who reports to
the Dean, and a larger number of curric-
ula for training students in various pro-
fessional fields of interest such as Civil
Engineering, Transportation Engineering,
Highway Engineering, Mechanical Engi-
neering, etc. Many of these curricula have
existed for years with but few changes.
Others have undergone modifications of
major significance. A few are new. For
example, at the University of Michigan
completely new curricula, leading to
Bachelor's degrees, have been approved
during the last four years iri Industrial
Engineering with Management and Pro-
duction Options, Materials Engineering,
Nuclear . Engineering, Instrumentation,
and this fall witnessed the begin-
ning of the Science Engineering program.
A great deal of discussion has been,
and is being, given to the subject of cur-
ricula. Should specialized programs such
as Aeronautical, Transportation, Indus-
trial, etc., be continued with professional
work included in the undergraduate
courses, or should the professional work
be retained for graduates and but one
curriculum provided with courses devoted
to basic sciences, engineering science,
and the humanities? There is a strong
movement at this time toward this latter
plan.
The committee on Evaluation of Engi-
neering Education1 of the American So-
ciety of Engineering Education has set up
a "time distribution" for scientifically
oriented curricula for experimental pur-
poses. "It is recognized that there are
many types of curricula and many reasons
for variations among institutions and
even among departments of the same in-
stitution. The experimental curricula call
for the following:
1. Humanistic and Social Studies about
1/5 the subject matter.
2. Mathematics, Physics and Chemis-
try, (Basic Sciences) about y4.
3. Engineering Science about %.
4. Major departmental sequences of
analysis, design, and engineering
systems, including necessary tech-
nological background, about y4.
5. The choice of option or electives in
a. Humanistic—Social Science
b. Basic Science
c. Engineering Science
d. Research or Thesis
e. Engineering Analysis and Design
f. Management
amounting to about 1/10.
This is a proposed four-year curriculum
with a common freshman year or a com-
mon two years if feasible." The student
should be able with little difficulty to
enter any of the professional programs at
the end of two years in this program as
is now possible between our present pro-
fessional programs. Electives, or option
study, may be provided to permit the stu-
dent to become acquainted with one or
two specific fields of specialization. The
above committee recommends that "re-
vised curricula should expend the offer-
ings in basic science, engineering science,
humanities, and social studies. Great em-
phasis should be given to instruction in
engineering science and its application to
analysis and design in engineering. An
engineering science, by definition, involves
largely the study of basic scientific prin-
ciples as related to engineering problems
and situations. The fields of engineering
science are divided specifically to include
mechanics of solids (statics, dynamics,
and strength of materials); fluid me-
chanics; thermodynamics electrical theory

(electrical circuits, fields, electronics);
transfer and weight mechanisms (heat,
mass and momentum transfer); and the
nature and properties of engineering ma-
terials."
It is further recommended that about
one-fourth of the engineering curriculum
be devoted to the study of the engineer-
ing sciences and approximately an equal
fraction to their application in a depart-
mental sequence in engineering analysis,
design, and engineering systems. This or-
ganization of basic science, engineering
science, and engineering analysis and de-
sign, becomes an integrated sequential
study of great importance.1
Economics, cost, and processes and
equipment are added subjects with which
the Mechanical, Industrial, Production
and Tool Engineers must be familiar.
Pure and applied sciences are not static,
and any course and curriculum revision
should reflect their progress,. Engineering
is an applied science and yet a thorough
understanding of the pure sciences is re-
quired. The latter are subjects such as
mathematics, physics, and chemistry, be-
ing taught by science departments, some-
times for the engineering college, as at
Michigan.
There are various grades of technically
trained personnel, such as the scientist,
the engineer, and the technician.'1
The scientist wants to know why thinks
happen—what basic laws govern phenom-
ena. He develops theories to interpret past
experiments or predicts results of future
ones. He may devise new methods and
theories for conducting and measuring
his experiments. Frequently, a scientist
works with engineers in the early stages
of practical development.
The engineer must have a sound back-
ground in the sciences of mathematics,
physics, and chemistry. Additional knowl-
edge of other subjects is helpful. The
engineer has an active curiosity about why
things work and how to make them do
it. He visualizes ways of putting new
knowledge to use. The engineer must be
most conscious and this distinguishes him
from the scientist.
The technician usually does not have
a complete engineering education in the
advanced phases of sciences, technical
subjects and economics. He is concerned
with how machines work and their oper-
ation. He may fulfill certain basic re-
quirements such as prepare drawings, test
machines, compile statistics, etc.
We are concerned here with the train-
ing of the engineer, particularly the pro-
duction or tool engineer, and his suc-
cessful placement in industry or profes-
sional work.
An engineering training should prepare
the student to understand the basic and
applied sciences as well as help develop
him to take his place in society. The uni-
versity alone cannot completely do this
job. It must have the help of the home,
schools, churches, and public prior to his
graduation, and the controlled training
and guidance of industry afterward. The
student should take an interest in having
a part in the development of basic laws of
science, the application of these laws, or
the design, manufacture, and application
or maintenance of equipment, to aid in
these studies or in the application of their
results. This training is not necessarily
completed by the four or five year college
course but should continue as graduate
study, adult education, or continual self-
study and reading before full professional
status is reached. Students in increasing
numbers recognize the limitations of
their college work for the bachelors de-
gree, or become interested in subjects or
courses not studied and continue with
graduate work leading to a master's, pro-
fessional or doctor's degree.
What is a Tool Engineer
The terms manufacturing, production,
industrial, and tool engineering are used
differently by various groups and indi-
viduals. Production engineering in Eng-
land is defined to be practically identical

with tool engineering in this country. The
American Society of Tool Engineers has
defined tool engineering very specifically
and in great detail, as quoted from Web-
sters International Dictionary and the
ASTE Handbook, as follows:
"A division of engineering in industry
applied, in broad terms, to the technique
of planning and equipping the processes
required for manufacturing industrial
products, etc., etc.
Courses at the University of Michigan
The courses in Production Engineering
at the University of Michigan are the re-
sult of the past thirty-five years' develop-
ment, beginning with shop courses, with
the idea of co-ordinating product design,
metallurgy and production. (Figure 1)
As an exception to the general rule, this
work was carried on outside the Mechani-
cal Engineering Department in the de-
partment known as Production Engineer-
ing.
In the spring of 1951, a complete cur-
riculum in Production Engineering was
presented to the authorities for approval.
The fact that production engineering, as a
curriculum, is not recognized by the
Engineering Council for Professional De-
velopment, and would probably not be
accredited, led us to integrate the pro-
posed Mechanical-Industrial and Produc-
tion Engineering curricula into one, to be
known as Industrial Engineering. Two
options were provided, management and
production. These two options follow a
common program for the first two years
but then begin to differ in order to pro-
vide courses for proper sequence in later
work.
The curriculum in Industrial Engineer-
ing with the two options was approved at
Michigan in June, 1951. The student pur-
suing this degree in Industrial Engineer-
ing elects his option at the beginning of
the junior year. Up to this time, all
courses are in common and not greatly
different from those of Mechanical Engi-
neering.
The Production Engineering option
of the Industrial Engineering curricu-
lum is intended to meet the needs
of those students primarily interest-
ed in the methods and operations of
manufacture. It includes the development,
operation, and control of processes, such
as casting, forging, rolling, die-casting,
stamping, welding, molding and ma-
chining. (Figures 2 and 3) It is con-
cerned with such functions as design for
production, parts routing and equipment
layout, and methods of manufacture; with
jig, fixture, gage, tool, machine-tool and
die design; and with technical estimating
and inspection. The objective is to ac-
quaint the student with principles and
methods of fabricating materials. The
production option obviously is related
more directly to the technical aspects of
materials, equipment, and application of
methods of manufacture. These students
may choose electives from among the
metallurgical, mechanical, physics chem-
istry, mathematics, and economics depart-
ment, and the school of Business Admin-
istration.
Graduate work leading to the degree of
Master of Science in Engineering, (Indus-
trial), and the Doctorate is available.
The undergraduate curriculum may be
divided into three parts:
The first part consists of the funda-
mental or preparatory courses of Mathe-
matics, Physics, Chemistry, English, Draw-
ing, and Engineering Materials and Proc-
esses, common to most professional cur-
ricula in engineering, requiring substan-
tially two years or four semesters to ac-
complish, giving 66 of the 144 hours
credit required for the degree.
The second part is devoted entirely to
technical courses for some 50 credit hours
required of all students. These include
courses in advanced work in fundamental

Consultant work for industry, a part of student's
training, may include determining performance of
new equipment. Ring is being ground to tolerances

engineering subjects, such as Engineering
Mechanics, Thermodynamics, Machine-
Design, Differential Equations, Instru-
mentation and Metallurgy. Four courses
cover the basic processes for the produc-
tion of metal parts, including casting,
plastic working, welding and machining.
Others are devoted to the study of ma-
terials and the design of the product and
equipment. Further courses cover business
administration, principles of organization,
engineering economics, and statistical
methods for engineers.
The third part of the curriculum con-
sists of options which enable the student
to concentrate on one or more of the
factors of production which interest him
most. This covers eight to eleven hours
of required courses, four to seven of pro-
fessional electives, and nine of free elec-
tives. The student may use the free elec-
tives for nontechnical courses or may
choose professional courses either for
further concentration in one particular
field or for obtaining a broader, more-
general background.
Wide Range of Opportunity
This is a curriculum, chiefly scientific in
content, designed to provide our tremend-
ous manufacturing industry with men
equipped with a scientific foundation,
who are familiar with materials, tools,
processes and machines. With a short
training period in the smaller companies,
these men will be of immediate value.
The very large companies have one- or
two-year training periods to accommo-
date the large group of students em-
ployed each year from a number of
schools with widely different types of
curricula. Some large companies report
that the specialization in engineering is
of no particular value to them. They, of
course, have a great variety of positions
in which to place the trainees. Statistics
show that the majority of the technical
graduates go with the smaller companies.
Design for production, research and de-
velopment, processing of parts, selection
and design of machines and cost estimat-
ing are promising fields, with supervision
and management as likely goals. The
welding, foundry, stamping, forging and
plastic industries, and the tool and die
shops, parts-manufacturing shops and
those making instruments for measuring
and inspection over a limitless field for
scientists and production engineers.
Withers?
In the above I have outlined the pro-
gram, now in effect, which is the result
of our effort to provide trained engineers
for the metal working industries. Indus-
try has helped in this development over
the years by offering many suggestions.
My greatest problem has not been in satis-
fying industry with this program but in
selling it to the University itself. The
University organization has not encour-
aged it, and industry, while invariably
enthusiastic when learning of the work,
has done little actively to support it. Each
one of the thirty-five years spent in this
development has been uphill. Our work
is still looked on by many as being less
scientific in nature or of the technical
school variety when compared with that
of the other professional departments.
This is definitely not so. The use of the
title "Tool Engineering" had to be avoid-
ed. Even "Production" has had to be
called Industrial to meet the standards set
by the Engineering Council for Profes-

What are my
chances for

a large company
like Du Pont?
P«t*r J. Meshkoff joined Du Pont at the Jackson
Laboratory in 1941, after obtaining a B.S.Ch.E. from
the University of Detroit and an M.S. from the Uni-
versity of Michigan. He has had a wide range of Du Pont
experience, from chemist in the Dye Works to chief
supervisor and works engineer at several plants, with
many opportunities to observe Du Pont personnel
policies. Today Pete Meshkoff is works engineer at
Du Font's new Film Plant at Circleville, Ohio.

Hersohel H. Loomis, Jr., will receive his B.S. degree in electrical
engineering from Cornell University June 1957. Herschel is a member
of the freshman and varsity rifle teams, an associate member of Octa-
gon, a dramatic group, and belongs to Theta Chi Fraternity. Like
many other students, he's making employment plans early.
Peter Meshkoff answers:
I our question is a natural one, Herschel—one we hear
quite often. Du Pont is unquestionably a large company
in total number of employees and in all its operations.
But, actually, Du Pont is made up of ten independent
departments, almost as if it were ten companies under
one management. And it is a fundamental policy at
Du Pont to promote from within and on merit only.
That produces many opportunities for new men, but
in addition there are proportionately more promotions
at Du Pont each year—by reason of expansion and re-
tirement—than you would find in most smaller com-
panies. I say "proportionately more" because Du Pont
has grown at an average rate of seven per cent a year for
the past 153 years—a record that few companies can
match.
And Du Pont is still growing rapidly. Take your field,
electrical engineering. A host of novel and challenging
problems have to be faced, both in new construction and
in maintenance. There are plants to design with features
that have never been applied before; there are new
equipment-control problems to work out, and new engi-
neering processes to pioneer. So, to answer your question
in a word, Herschel, I'd say your chances of promotion
on merit are extremely good at Du Pont!

sional Development accrediting commit-
tees.
One may ask, "What's in a name?" My
experience has shown it to be an import-
ant factor leading to failure or success.
One may also ask, "Who is this accredit-
ing committee?" Industry, the teaching
profession, and the Founder societies are
represented on it—perhaps by too few ag-
gressive individuals representing industry,
which is vitally interested in engineering
education.
Our students in Production Engineer-
ing are not "pure theorist" but they do
have a good training in the basic sciences
and a number of courses of an applied
nature which should make them readily
available for the industry referred to. It
must be remembered that a student can
elect only a few of the advanced technical
courses offered, and that not many stu-
dents, up to the time of their graduation,
have the slightest idea of the nature of
the work in which they will be engaged.
During their last few months before
graduation they have an opportunity to
interview a number of company repre-
sentatives visiting the University to hire
graduates. The staff discusses these in-
terviews later with the student to help
him see clearly the fields before him. He
often decides to take employment with a
company of which he has little or no
knowledge, involving a type of work
passed by entirely in his studies. I believe
this is where his training in the basic
sciences helps him most. He is better able
to adapt himself to the new situation.
How many times we find an engineer
with one degree of specialization, such
as mechanical, engaged in work of an-
other type, in but a few'^years after grad-
uation. This does occur more often than
most of us realize. Probably one of the
most valuable characteristics learned in
school is that of having an open mind
about every new problem confronted.
Shortage of Students
For the past several years there has
been, and still is, a shortage of engineer-
ing graduates, based on industrial re-
quirements. This is due primarily to the
shortage of students coming from high
school prepared to study engineering. The
number of students in high school is
greater but the courses are more numer-
ous and fewer are required in the sciences.
Material published recently by the
American Physics Society indicates that
the percentage of students studying
mathematics and science in the secondary
schools has dropped from approximately
25% in 1900 to less than 4% in 1954.
Thus a large percentage of high school
graduates have been led away from the
scientific courses and are not interested in
making up this deficiency in order to en-
roll in an engineering curriculum."
The National Office of Selective Serv-
ice recently told me that this lack of
scientific training in the elementary
schools is of the greatest concern to them
in regard to the adequate supply of engi-
neers for national safety. Often social sci-
ences are allowed or required in place of
the physical sciences. This seems to be the
line of least resistance for the majority of
high school students and it is little won-
der that they are not interested in study-
ing engineering in college.
Colleges should take a greater interest
in high school training. Bulletins are sent
to secondary schools by most colleges but
the greatest influence seems toward sports,
music, the arts, etc. On many occasions 1
have entertained groups of high school
students by showing them our laboratories
and speaking to them at a luncheon after-
ward. Questions asked in many cases indi-
cated a profound interest but a lack of
understanding of the profession of engi-

ELECTRONICS INDUSTRY
It has been predicted that automation
may soon become the nation's No. 1 in-
dustry. This idea was put forth by Dean
E. Wooldridge, president of Ramo-
Wooldridge Corporation. Mr. Wool-
dridge urged industry to follow the "sys-
tems" idea used by the military rather
than the "black" box approach. By this
he simply means that the operators should
be more technical in nature than at pres-
ent. He believes this will bring about
rapid and large gains from automation.
At a symposium on "Electronics and
Automatic Production" held in San Fran-
cisco on August 22-23, the prediction was
made by Paul B. Wishart, President of
Minneapolis-Honeywell Regulator Com-
pany, that within ten years many small
and medium-sized companies will be able
to produce as much as the larger com-
panies by their wise use of automation.
According to Mr. Wishart, the makers of
automatic equipment know that their larg-
est market is the small businesses of less
than 1,000 employees where automatic
machinery is needed to compete.
We shall now see what some of the
newer trends are toward automation.
Modular Construction
One of the most recent developments
in the field of electronic-component as-
sembly is the invention of modular con-
struction. During the Korean conflict,
many of our manufactured jet planes were
sidelined waiting for electronic equip-
ment. Seeing a need for a new, fast means
of this type of production, the govern-
ment provided $4.7 million dollars for
what was called "Project Tinkertoy."
This money was used to build a small
factory in Arlington, Virginia, which was
equipped to build electronic equipment
subassemblies entirely by automatic ma-
chines. It was here that modular construc-
tion was born. A modula is simply an en-
tirely machine-made vacuum tube stage
consisting of condensers, coils, resistors,
etc. The components are built on a series
of wafers which are stacked and tied to-
gether with wires which run down the
sides. At every stage of construction, the
units are automatically inspected and the
faulty ones rejected.
One of the big advantages of modular
construction is that when a piece of equip-
ment becomes defective, the whole modu-
lar unit may be replaced at a great saving
in time. This omits having to trouble-
shoot the equipment to find the faulty
part. The really important advantage is
that modular construction makes possible
tremendous production as exemplified by
this small plant in Arlington, Virginia,
Reprinted from The Rose Technic
Rose Polytechnic Institute
which can produce up to 1,000 modular
subassemblies per hour.
Automatic Assembly
Another modern development toward
complete automation is the Autofab. De-
veloped and manufactured by the Mech-
anical Division of General Mills, Inc.,
the Autofab is an automatic machine
which attaches electronic components to
printed circuit fiberboard. It consists of
twenty-four attaching heads which hold
the parts until needed and a conveyor
system which moves the circuit boards
from head to head. The boards are
moved along by compressed air to cut
down transit time. The Autofab norm-
ally produces a finished assembly every
three seconds, which amounts to about
10,000 per eight-hour day. It is versatile
in that it will handle boards from two-
inches to ten-inches long or wide, with
the number of attached components be-
ing variable up to twenty-four. The at-
taching force is applied to the leads so
that no strain is put on the boards or
parts. If a part should be improperly at-
tached, the machine automatically stops.
Also, when the parts in one head art-
used up, the machine stops and indicates
the empty head with a light. The parts are

readied for the Autofab in another ma-
chine in which they are simply dumped.
It then proceeds to straighten the leads,
cut them off to the proper length, apply
wrap-around sleeves, and load them into
magazines. The magazines are then placed
on the heads when needed. A magazine
usually holds about 600 parts and can be
attached while the machine is running.
Each head holds several magazines so that
the machine need never stop.
The first Autofab was built for Inter-
national Business Machines Corporation
and is to be used to make printed circuit
subassemblies for use in air-defense com-
puters. Each computer will require sev-
eral thousand assemblies. Although the
Autofab is now being used to make na-
tional defense equipment, it will prob-
ably be adopted by leading television
manufacturers in the near future. It of-
fers tremendously increased production at
lower cost and with better-quality work.
Also, it requires only two operators and a
supervisor. Actually, the only disadvant-
age it has is the large initial cost incurred
by any manufacturer in converting over.
The television industry is now begin-
ning to switch over to automation. Of all
the manufacturers, the Admiral Corpora-
tion seems to be leading the field with
about 75 per cent of the circuitry in the
new 1956 models being done by auto-
matic machines. In 1952 the first step was
taken with the advent of dip soldering.
This is simply a way of wiring equipment
so that all the connections can be soldered
at one time by dipping them in a solder
pot. Since 1952, Admiral has been build-
ing its own automatic equipment. This
has enabled them to get the jump on the
other manufacturers. The other companies
will have to buy commercial equipment
in order to catch up and will have to in-
vest a large amount of money in the new
machines. Just for example, the "Auto-
fab," built by General Mills, costs about
$100,000 while many others run even
higher. It is this high initial cost which is
expected to put many small manufacturers
out of business. As far as cutting costs,
Admiral now has three automatic assem-
blers in operation, which have eliminated
425 soldered connections in each receiver.
This has enabled the company to reduce
the cost of one model from $500 to $340
in one year. Also, R.C.A. claims to have
reduced costs by as much as 29 per
cent.
Handling
The Sylvania Electric Products, Inc.,
plant of Batavia, New York, is now pro-
ducing a new television set every twenty
seconds, thanks to their recently installed
conveyor system. This amounts to about
1,400 sets per eight-hour day. The Ba-
tavia plant now contains four continuous
assembly lines, each functioning inde-
pendently of the others. It was found that
700-foot assembly lines were impractical,
so the lines were built in three opera-
tional segments, interconnected by three-
inch overhead trolley conveyors. The pur-
pose of the overhead conveyors is to move
components to the place where the next
stage of assembly is being done. Sylvania
makes about 60 production model sets of
which four can be built at a time on in-
dependent lines.
The first operation toward building a
set is building the tuner assembly. From
here the set goes by overhead conveyor to
the chassis-build department. This is the
department in which the major portion of
the work is done. The chassis will be
complete except for the picture tube when
it leaves this area. It is then completed,
tested, and boxed up.
There are two types of carriers used
with the conveyor system. The first is of
30-lb. capacity and travels at 16 feet per
minute. It carries parts and small assem-
blies such as tuners to the place where
they are going to be used. The second is
for larger items and will carry up to 122
lbs. at 20 feet per minute. To prevent er-
rors, the carriers of each line are painted
a different color. It is estimated that with-
out the conveyors, 85 people would be
required to transport assemblies and de-
liver parts to the different areas. At pres-
ent there are only 38 people doing this
kind of work. Without the conveyor, the
parts would have to be stored at various
assembly points, but now they are stored
on the conveyor.
Wire Wrap
For many years, all electronic equip-
ment connections have been soldered, but
now with the perfection of wire wrap
techniques, soldering may become of only
secondary importance. Bell Telephone
Laboratories have developed a machine
which automatically wraps six turns of
solid wire around rectangular terminal*.
The wires are wrapped at a pressure of
about 15,000 lbs. per square inch, which
provides an airtight, corrosion-resistant
connection. The M-4, as it is called, is
controlled by a punched type on which
the information is recorded. It contains
two spindles, one of which pulls the wire
against the terminal, and a second which
strips off the insulation and wraps the
wire. The wire is automatically cut off to
the correct length and the machine goes
on to the next terminal. It saves a tre-
mendous amount of time, in that there
are no wires to cut to length, strip, and
store, and no hand wiring. The wire is
supplied from a standard spool of wire.
Printed Circuits
The use of printed circuits is becoming
very common in the electronics industry,
and for good reason. They offer a saving
in time and money and are reducing the
size and weight of electronic equipment
to unheard-of values.
A printed circuit can be made in sev-
eral ways. One of the most common ways
is to use the silk-screen method of print-
ing. With this method the desired pat-
tern is placed on the screen to form a
stencil. Then the stencil is brought to-
gether with the fiberboard, and a silver
formulation is forced through the un-
blocked holes in the screen. This prints
the wanted design on the board in silver
ink. Another method of accomplishing
this printing is to plate a thin coating of
copper on the sides of the fiberboard and
to apply a photograph emulsion over the
copper. Once the emulsion is exposed
with the proper image, it is developed,
thus leaving a coating of acid-resisting
material over the desired pattern. An acid
is applied and the unwanted copper is
eaten away. When the coating is washed
off, the desired "printed circuit" remains.
This method is called photo-etching.
Not only may the boards contain the

Dr. D. B. Steinman
designer of the Mackinac Straits bridge
By TOM PRUNK
This month the Michigan Technic has
chosen to discuss the accomplishments of
Dr. David B. Steinman, a civil engineer,
who is presently the chief consulting
engineer for the bridge spanning the
Straits of Mackinac. Dr. Steinman has
been chosen by the University of Michi-
gan to speak at their annual honors con-
vocations in May of this year because of
this.
Dr. Steinman was born in 1886 and his
first desire for bridge building was stim-
ulated in early life by the Brooklyn
Bridge which was located a short dis-
tance from his boyhood home. At this
time Steinman studied the details of the
construction—the anchorages and the
cables, the trussing and the beams, the
stonework of the towers, and the radiat-
ing stays. From this he developed a life-
long dream—to become a builder of
bridges. As the years passed this dream
stayed with him until finally he entered
the City College of New York where he
received his B.S. (summa cum laude) in
1906. Then he studied at Columbia Uni-
versity where he received the CE. and
M.A. in 1909 and the Ph.D. in 1911.
After receiving these various degrees
and several other honors. Dr. Steinman
taught civil engineering in the University
of Idaho and at City College until 1920
when he resigned himself to designing
bridges alone. Since this time he has
built or worked on 300 or more bridges
all over the world. By doing this he fol-
lowed in the footsteps of his lifelong
idol, John A. Roebling, who designed
the famous Brooklyn Bridge.
One of the first bridges on which Stein-
man spent considerable time was the Hell
Gate Bridge which spans the East River
in New York City. He was the assistant
to Gustav Lindenthal during its construc-
tion from 1915 to 1917.
After the Hell Gate Bridge was com-
pleted, Dr. Steinman went to South
America and was consulting engineer on
the Florianopolis Bridge in Brazil. This
bridge, which was completed in 1926,
spans 1,114 feet, which is the longest in
South America. Besides the bridges
named above, Dr. Steinman has contrib-
uted greatly toward the completion of
such other works as: the Grand'Mere in
Quebec, St. Johns in Oregon, the Tri-
borough and the Henry Hudson Bridges
in New York City, the Thousand Island
Bridge, the Vancouver Bridge in British
Columbia, and the Marine Parkway in
New York City.
At the present time, Dr. Steinman is
the chief consulting engineer for the
bridge which is to cross the Straits of
Mackinac. This bridge has a span of
3,800 feet and, when completed, will be
second only to the Golden Gate Bridge
(4,200 feet) in length. This bridge
should be completed sometime in 1957
and will cost well over 70 million dol-
lars.
Already, before the construction of the
Mackinaw Bridge is completed. Dr. Stein-
man is planning to build a bridge across
the Messina Straits which separate Italy
and Sicily. This bridge is to be the larg-
est in the world having a main span of
5,000 feet and being two miles long from
shore to shore. It will be a double deck
bridge using the top level for cars, trucks,
etc.' and the lower one for railway traffic.
Besides supervising the construction of
many bridges, Dr. Steinman has written
several technical articles on the theory be-
hind bridge building. His work is truly-
outstanding in his field and in the entire
civilized world. The bridges he built will
serve as an everlasting monument to him
and his genius.

years old. The mother is twice the age
the monkey was when the mother was
half as old as the monkey will be when
the monkey is three times as old as the
monkey was. The weight of the rope is
one half as much again as the difference
between the weight of the weight plus
the weight of the monkey. How long is
the rope?
Thanks to Gil Steiner, regrettably of
L.S. &amp; A., for this one about the high
monkey-monk of present-day culture, the
psychologist. It seems this man was inter-
ested in measuring the rare phenomenon
known as intelligence. Choosing three
brilliant students he proceeded to deter-
mine which was most on his toes by blind-
folding the three, seating them in a circle
and painting each of their foreheads with
either a red or a green dot. Upon re-
moving the blindfolds he asked that any
of the three who saw a green dot raise
his hand. Three hands were raised. Then
the psychologist instructed each to de-
cide what color was on his own forehead.
After some time, one of the three finally
told what color he had on his forehead.
What was it and how did he know?
Five men and a monkey were maroon-
ed on an island in the Pacific. They spent
their first day gathering the only source
of food: coconuts. Men faced with pos-
sible starvation not being prone to trust
their fellow men, during the night each
of the men stole out and got what he
thought was his share. Each man divided
the pile of nuts he found into five equal
parts and hid his share. In every case,
there was one extra coconut which was
given to the monkey. On the following
day, the men met and divided the re-
maining pile into five exactly equal piles.
How many coconuts were in the original
pile?
Last month we left one of our friends
playing a kind of beat-the-clock with
ping-pong balls. At twelve o'clock—
which time did indeed arrive, the process
of receiving and destroying is all that
was not defined at twelve o'clock and is
the only thing which must take place be-
fore that time is reached.—by playing it
cool, this man could have any number of
ping-pong balls his little heart desired.
Here's the line of reasoning: Any ping-
pong ball he ever had he got before
12:00, no? Any ping-pong ball he de-
stroyed he destroyed before 12:00, no?
Yes. Also, for every ball he destroyed- he
later destroyed another one. Therefore, if
the first ball he destroyed was the ball
numbered one, and the second ball he
destroyed was the ball numbered two,
etc., through the first ten balls, and from
there on the next balls destroyed were
numbered 11, 12, and so on through the
infinitude of integers ... he would have
no balls at 12:00. (If you don't trust this
reasoning, take a gander at pages 283 and
284 of the text used for Math 13 and 14,
Britton and Sniveley's Algebra for Col-
lege Students. The topic: mathematical in-
duction.) Similarly, if he never destroyed
the first seven balls, he would still have
them at 12:00, a feat he could perform
by starting his destruction processes with
balls 8, 9, 10, etc. A very similar process
would be used in order to wind up with
13 balls, remembering that one of the
first ten balls must be destroyed. Part of
the trick to understanding this—believe
us, there is no sleight of hand in the ex-
planation—is to realize that there was
never any last ball destroyed. Thus, all
the balls but the ones the man purposely
kept were destroyed.
As for the binary arithmetic exercises,
here are the answers:
1) 37—15=10110 (binary system) =
22.
2) 9/64=.001001 (exactly, binary sys-
tem.)
3) 614 x 5 1/128-11111.010011001
(binary system)=31 153/512.
So much for last month; here are some
comments on this month's teasers:
Without too much monkey business,
the length of that rope can be expressed
in terms of the mother's age. Expressing
the monkey's age in terms of the moth-
er's age, and their ages at any other time
by the addition of a constant, will lead
to the value of the mother's age, and
from there to the length of the rope. Un-
confirmed report has it that the length is
5 feet, but you know how these inaccur-
ate women are.
There must have been at least two
green dots on foreheads, otherwise one
man would not have seen any. Thus, if
any man saw both a red and a green dot,
he would immediately know his own
color. Therefore our hero, seeing two
green dots and not hearing anyone else
declare that they knew what color they
wore, concluded his dot was also green.
That coconut one is a tough nut to
crack, unless one takes two unknowns:
Let N equal the number of nuts in the
original pile- and let n equal the number
of coconuts falling to each man on the
morning after the night before. One of
the two necessary equations states that the
sum of the parts is equal to the whole;
the other states 5n- to an expression in
N for the final pile. You are welcome to
take the arithmetic from there; have a
happy vacation doing it, and rejoin us
next fall for some more monkeyshines.

"A Better America Through Chemical Progreu
MAY, 1956


o
The word "automation" was coined in
Detroit in 1948. Since that time this
word has caused some interesting reac-
tions. Management is enthused because it
promises lower cost, labor is concerned
and even terrified because it appears that
machinery will "take over" completely,
the general public is curious because of
so much publicity, and the economists
are elated because they have a new con-
cept to play with. According to one writer
however the reaction is 90% due to emo-
tion and 10% the result of fact.
Automation has been called the biggest
thing since the Industrial Revolution, but
it did not begin in 1948. In 1780 Oliver
Evans built a grist mill near Philadelphia
that contained a series of elevators and
conveyors which carried grain into and
through the mill, and finally carried flour
out of the mill. This trend has been con-
tinuing since then, but until 1948 it was
merely a concept lumped into the general
idea of mass production. Now that the
concept has a name it is being publicized
a great deal, and the sudden awareness
that automation can be found in most
high and medium production industries
makes it seem more prominent than it is.
Statistics show that in the metalworking
industry only about 16% of the opera-
tions are automated, the aircraft industry
has 9% and the electrical industry has
14% automation. In the metalworking
industry the figure for 1940 was 8% and
for I960 the prediction is 22%. A look
into the various economic "pressures" ex-
erted by various segments of society will
show the cause for and result of more
automation.
Management
The object of management of course is
to maximize profit (or at least minimize
losses in certain areas). The profit mar-
gin is the margin between the selling
price and total cost of a product. The sell-
ing price is rather well determined by
public demand (except in a few non-
competitive industries). The challenge
facing management then is to reduce
costs, and these costs are generally classi-
fied as material cost and labor costs. The
cost of material is an area of interest to
the engineering staff; the cost of labor,
which in the metalworking industry is
often between 30 and 40% of the total
cost, is an area in which management has
been able to work a direct influence by
investing in labor saving devices and
machinery. However, the cost of such
labor saving devices and machinery is in
many cases very high, so high that, con-
sidering the 15 to 20 year allowable de-
preciation rate for tax purposes and the
extra cost of maintaining the specialized
equipment, it would be more economical
to retain the laborer. There are a few
places where in spite of the economy in
retaining labor it is necessary to install
automatic machinery such as in the
handling of very heavy or dangerous
materials.
Investing in machinery is not always
prohibitive. The saving experienced
ranges from very little to the amount
saved in the following two cases. In 1900
the cost of producing 1 kilowatt of elec-
tricity was 17 cents, today it is 2.69 cents.
In 1915 the production of automobile en-
gine cylinder heads required an invest
ment of $243,000 with direct labor cost
per head at 40 cents. Today the invest-
ment in one machine to perform all
operations automatically is $263,000 with
direct labor cost at 4 cents per head, and
the production rate for the same invest-
ment has tripled and quadrupled! The
saving of 36 cents per head is even more
significant in view of the declining value

of the dollar from 1915 to 1956.
The future as far as management sees
it is in the direction of ever increasing
rate of automating. The factors that en-
courage automating are higher labor costs
and higher work standards. The factors
that discourage automating are high cost
of machinery and slow allowable depre-
ciation rate. Everyone feels sure that labor
cost will increase, the cost of machinery
will increase too but so will the machine
efficiency, and also manufacturers have
been able to work the depreciation rate
on automation machinery down to 12%
per year.
Labor
Much of the publicity automation re-
ceives contains facts and figures of how
many people are displaced by some new
machine. The general public takes this in-
formation, along with the predictions of
more automation, to mean that sooner or
later machines will dominate us, and
what will happen if these machines ever
take a notion to become belligerent? To
the people being displaced or to most
anyone in the same plant the possibility
is even more real because already some
of the new, mysterious gadgets are upon
them.
This feeling was brought to light in a
radio poll in Detroit in the summer of
1955- which found that the fear of auto-
mation is second only to the fear of
Russia. A learned gentleman from M.I.T.
has supported this feeling by stating, "It
is perfectly clear that this will produce an
employment situation in comparison with
which the depressions in the 30's will
seem a pleasant joke."
The uneasiness caused by automation
has no base. In the first place, philos-
ophers assure us that no "creation" of
man can be superior to man. Engineers
tell us that so far there has been no de-
vice made that can displace human beings
in any area that requires judgment or
original thought, which probably is of
little comfort to some people.
In a more direct sense the possibility of
people being displaced is only part of the
picture. It has been a fact that when a
new automatic machine is ordered it takes
people to build them, more people than
to build simple machines. The new ma-
chine needs setup and maintenance men.
The new machine produces parts for
lower cost, which results in more demand
for more products. The increased produc-
tion means more of these products are in
the hands of the consumer where more
service men will be needed. The figure
from the past to support this are as fol-
lows: Machine tool builders employ 60%
more people than 9 years ago, the cost of
overhead in factories which usually in-
clude maintenance cost has increased 30
to 50% in the last 10 years, and the pur-
chase of services has increased 16% since
1947. On the other hand, the number
of people on production lines has in gen-
eral not changed because of the produc-
tion of things never dreamed of 10 years
ago, of which some were made possible
by automation. All this seems to indicate
that automation has actually created more
jobs than it has destroyed. This has been
true since machinery was invented. In the
last 30 years in the United States the
population has increased but unemploy-
ment has not increased on the average.
Experts in industry, and government econ-
omists estimate that about 40% more
goods and services will be required in
1965 with only 12% more people to do
the work. To accomplish this we need
either longer hours or more productivity
per worker. The national average in pro-
ductivity increase per worker in the past
has been between 2 and 3% per year. If
productivity increases at the same rate,
this will leave the market short in 1965.
From this point of view we need auto-
mation.
Besides relatively better job security a
worker's type of job has also been im-
proved. As stated before, automation
closes jobs on the production line but
opens new jobs in maintenance, machine
building and servicing. This represents
a shift from low or no skill jobs to high-
ly skilled jobs. The plumber becomes a
hydraulics expert' the electrician becomes
an electronics repairman and people of
lower skills become the plumbers and
the electricians. With higher skills often
comes more job satisfaction and always
higher pay.
The General Public
So far those classified as being members
of the general public have only been curi-
ous. Of course everyone is affected and
will be affected by automation. The only
way to "escape" it is to live the life of a
hermit on a remote island, and in moving
to the island be sure to do so by raft
made with logs and vines. If automation
is a vague and remote term well it might
remain so.
The public or the consumer sees the
evidence of automation in the products he
can purchase. He must admit that in spite
of the increase in cost of living he has
access to a much higher class of merchan-
dise than was available even 5 years ago.
It must be that there is no strenuous
resistance to the increasing cost of living
because people continue to spend money
for more elaborate things every day. The
more he buys the lower the prices become,
or the better the quality available for the
same price, and the lower the prices be-

Today's powerful turbo-jet and turbo-prop engines
are a far cry from the aircraft engines of a mere 10
years ago.
But we've hardly scratched the surface. We're still
pioneering.
Sure, the sound barrier's been cracked. But, who
knows, perhaps in the next 10 years we'll be flying at
speeds 2 or 3 times the speed of sound. Newer, more
complex, more powerful engines ARE in the offing.
There'll be new fields to conquer. For instance, the
thermal barrier!
Allison, a pioneer in the design, development and
production of aircraft engines, now is working on
advanced design turbine engines to meet future re-
quirements . . . whatever they might be. Proven fea-
tures of engines like the Allison J71 and T56 may be
adapted to the engines of tomorrow. Allison engines
of the future will be backed up with worlds of ex-
perience gained in the development and production
of its first 100,000 aircraft engines.
Now, Allison is in the midst of a $75 million ex-
pansion program in engineering research and de-
velopment facilities. Completion of the program will
give Allison one of the world's most complete, best-
equipped, centers for the development of new, high
performance turbo-prop and turbo-jet aircraft en-
gines. This opens new and unlimited opportunities
for young graduate engineers, for the program—
financed by General Motors—creates an immediate
need for a 40% increase in engineers.

SPECTROSCOPY
AT MICHIGAN
For something like the past fifty years
the most important accessory the astron-
omer has had to attach to the focus of
his telescopes has been the spectroscope
or spectrograph. The only contact the
astronomer or astrophysicist has with the
enormous majority of celestial objects is
through the light that he is able to see, to
photograph, or to measure electronically.
Therefore, he must analyze this radiation
as thoroughly as possible. The spectro-
graph, by breaking up any incoming light
into all of its component colors, allows
the astrophysicist to study the behavior
of all wave lengths which reach him and
to examine the multitude of bright and
dark spectral lines present in the spectra
of all astronomical objects. These lines
are usually the most interesting feature of
the spectrum of any object, since only one
atom, ion, or molecule, is responsible for
each individual line. Through a study of
these lines not only the abundances and
the density of the gases in the atmos-
pheres of stars or planets can be found,
but also the temperatures, velocities, accel-
erations and locations of the radiating
atomic particles.
Here in the Astronomy Department
the staff members and graduate students
are all experts at analyzing spectra. Given
the spectrum of an unknown object, any
one of the inhabitants of the Observatory
across from the University Hospital or of
the McMath-Hulbert Observatory just
north of Pontiac can tell at a glance the
approximate values of each of the con-
ditions that exist in the atmosphere of
the star. And many of the University
astronomers are experts in constructing
the very often elaborate equipment need-
ed to break down the light of the wide
variety of objects encountered by the
astronomer.
At the McMath-Hulbert Observatory
they have recently completed construction
of a mammoth spectrograph, which has
been the talk of the astronomical world
for the past year. The University astro-
physicists at this observatory are primar-
ily interested in the sun, which is one of
the very few astronomical objects shining
with a brightness great enough to allow
its spectrum to be analyzed with the most
powerful equipment man can build. This
new spectrograph is completely enclosed
in a steel cylinder four feet in diameter
and 52 feet long, from which about
99.99% of the air has been removed. By
sending the light through this near-
vacuum, all of the disturbances caused by
the light of the sun heating the air are
removed. As a result, the spectra of the
sun which have been obtained with this
instrument are far sharper than have ever
been obtained before. It is now possible
to separate two narrow spectral lines in
the green region of the solar spectrum
whose wave lengths differ by only one-
two hundred billionth of an inch!
Already this splendid new instrument
has thrown new light on some of the
questions which have been puzzling solar
astrophysicists. But, as usual, many new-
problems have been turned up by the
better-than-ever spectrograms being ob-
tained daily at the McMath-Hulbert Ob-
servatory.
Practically everyone has seen the large,
white dome at one end of the main ob-
servatory building in Ann Arbor. It
houses a 37-inch reflecting telescope, the
largest owned by the University. Since its
completion in 1911, it has been used
almost exclusively for the spectroscopic
study of stars. Even now, some forty-
five years later, it is operated on nearly
every clear night, gathering new informa-
tion, primarily on stars whose bright-
nesses are irregular. In size it is far sur-
passed by some of the giant telescopes in
California, and its efficiency has been
greatly reduced by the increased smoke

By PROFESSOR WILLIAM LILLER, Astronomy Department
Professor Liller, author of "Astronomical Spectrography" is
not at all unknown to the Technic sctaff. His article last year on
a related subject proved his outstanding capabilities. And no
wonder he knows what he's talking about—a graduate from
Harvard in 1948, he furthered his education here at Michigan
and obtained his Masters and Ph.D. Now interested in instru-
ment design and electronics, he still pursues his scientific inter-
ests. Oh, incidentally, he teaches Astronomy 12, 51 and 53.
and haze rising out of Ann Arbor, but
none-the-less, the number of variables stars
is great and the quality of the spectra
obtained with this telescope is high. The
large number of publications which have
appeared during the past ten years attests
to its productivity.
At the end of the last war, it became
obvious that there was a great need for a
moderate sized telescope located far away
from the city lights and smoke. In 1950
the Curtis Schmidt telescope was dedi-
cated, and, like the 37-inch reflector here
in Ann Arbor, it is used on nearly every
clear night. Located near Portage Lake
some sixteen miles northwest of the
campus, the Schmidt telescope has been
provided with two large glass prisms,
which make it possible to photograph the
spectra of a large number of stars at one
time. Although the detail which one can
see in these spectra is not as great as that
obtained on photographs taken with the
37-inch telescope, the exposure times
which are needed are far less than those
necessary with the Ann Arbor telescope.
Hence, this instrument is ideal for the
mass production study of stars and other
night-time objects. Recently a small, com-
pact spectrograph for use with the
Schmidt has been constructed with pro-
vision to measure the distribution of
brightness in the spectrum of a star,
planet, nebula, or galaxy with photoelec-
tric cells. With this equipment one can
determine with extremely high precision
exactly how the light of different wave
lengths is distributed along any spectrum.
Recent developments in photo-cell manu-
facture have also made it possible to study
infra-red wave lengths, which until re-
cently have been unobservable except in
the spectra of the brightest astronomical
objects.
In the past few years an entirely new
branch of astronomy has cropped up.
This new field deals with the study of
celestial radiation of radio wave lengths.
The enormous growth of radio astronomy
has resulted in the addition of a radio
astronomer to the University faculty. He
is Prof. Fred T. Haddock, who in a few
short years has established a glowing
reputation for himself. Since he must be
as adept in handling radio problems as
those of astronomy, he will spend part of
his time at the Observatory and part of
his time in the Electrical Engineering De-
partment. A close cooperation between
the two departments will lead within a
year or so to the construction of a tele-
scope far greater in size than the 200-
inch telescope on Mount Palomar. The
telescope will be of the reflecting type,
and its reflecting mirror will have a diam-
eter of 28 feet, or 336 inches. However,
since it will be gathering radio rather
than light waves, it will not look much
like a conventional telescope. The mirror
surface will be of a fine wire mesh, and
it will be rugged enough to stand un-
covered in the middle of a field not far
from the Schmidt telescope at Portage
Lake. Prof. Haddock is planning to pro-
vide receiving equipment which will
sweep much of the radio spectrum of
astronomical objects, a technique which
has been developed only very recently.
Most of the radio telescope's daylight
hours will be spent following the sun,
which is one of the fainter but the most
complex radio source known. Naturally,
the staff of astrophysicists at the Mc-
Math-Hulbert Observatory will be work-
ing very closely with Prof. Haddock on
this phase of work. During the dark
hours, however, the instrument will be
turned on such radio sources as colliding
galaxies, huge clouds of dust and gas,
and the remains of stars annihilated in
past centuries by tremendous explosions
of unknown origin. The plans are to add
at a later date a second, even larger, ra-
dio telescope, which will be able to look
much deeper into space and examine far
smaller regions of the sun's surface.

is powered by Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft's J-57 engine.
First all-jet heavy U. S. Air Force bombers are the huge Boeing
B-52s, powered by eight J-57s mounted in pairs.
The Douglas F4D Skyray, fastest Navy jet fighter, will be pow-
ered with the big J-57 engine.
The Douglas A3D, the Navy's most powerful carrier-based
attack airplane, has two J-57 engines.
Blazing the Way for a New
Generation of Air Power
The most powerful turbojet engine in production is
blazing the way for a whole new generation of
American aircraft.
That engine is Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft's J-57,
the first turbojet to achieve an official rating in the
10,000-pound thrust class.
But the J-57 provides far more than extreme high
thrust. Its unique Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft design,
achieved after years of intensive research and engi-
neering, offers as well the low specific fuel consump-
tion so vital to jet-powered bombers and future
transports, plus the additional important factor of
fast acceleration.
The importance of the J-57 in America's air power
program is clearly shown by the fact that it is the
power plant for three of the new "century series"
fighters for the U. S. Air Force—North American's
F-100, McDonnell's F-101 and Convair's F-102-
as well as Boeing's B-52 heavy bomber. The Navy,
too, has chosen the J-57 for its most powerful attack
aircraft, the Douglas A3D, the Douglas F4D fighter
and for the Chance Vought F8U day fighter. And
the J-57 will power the Boeing 707 jet transport.
The J-57 is fully justifying the long years and
intensive effort required for its development, pro-
viding pace-setting performance for a new genera-
tion of American aircraft.
Engineering graduates who can see the challenge in this new generation, might well
consider a career with the world's foremost designer and builder of aircraft engines.

come the more he buys. The more he
buys, the more management feels the
need for automation machinery to in-
crease production to lower costs. On and
on the cycle goes, but the inescapable fact
is that the consumer is a part of the move-
ment toward automation. To the con-
sumer the term is vague but his contribu-
tion is very real.
The Future
If the past is an indication of our eco-
nomic future we have every reason to be
optimistic. Like everything else automa-
tion can either increase or decrease in
application. If automation decreases in
usefulness all of the trends previously
described would go into reverse. If auto-
mation stands still so will wage increases
and the standard of living. If automation
increases slightly as it is today it will
work to the advantage of everyone, man-
agement, labor and the general public.
Another possibility feared by many is
rapid increase in automation or whole-
sale automation of an industry in a month
or two. If this were to be attempted it
would indeed be disastrous, but fortunate-
ly no one wants to or could do it if he
wanted to. It is both economical and
physically impossible. First of all no in-
dustry can afford it. Besides that it is
impossible to build all the required ma-
chinery in a short time. Also to change
over all at once to automation would
mean stopping production while the phys-
ical change over is made. Then it would
take some time to train new operators and
maintenance men. After that it would
take considerable manipulation to bal-
ance output with public demand.
Sudden change over would require a
tremendous amount of cash. No competi-
tive industry has that much cash because
if the industry were very profitable com-
petition would increase. Non-competitive
industries wouldn't need automation in
the first place because the purpose of auto-
mation is to gain competitive advantage.
The change to automation is inevitable
and must of necessity be slow. The con-
sumer and labor determine what process
should be automated, and management
will respond for the sake of survival.
From this point of view automation
can bring nothing but prosperity. The
people that fear automation have the
most to gain. Labor can be assured of bet-
ter jobs and higher income. The general
public, who spends the money labor has
earned, has more money with which to
bid for a higher standard of living. At
the same time management is optimistic
about progress, and the economist can
write a new book on another vague topic.
Mr. Kenneth Ludema is well qualified to write his article,
"Economic Aspects of Automation." A Production Engineer,
now teaching CMI and PE 181, Mr. Ludema holds a bright
future. As well as teaching here at Michigan, he is spending his
time "machining rotors for ultramotors," a General Electric
project. After he obtains his Master's degree this June, his future
plans include a job in Machine Tool Design.

PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERING
Here is the story on how to be good boys by a
professional engineer of many years standing.
ETHICS
The word ethics is new, yet old—Con-
fucius advocated its use, Moses furthered
its use, the crusaders used it as a code
and it is still in force today.
I should like to read Webster's defini-
tion of "ethics." . . . The science which
treats of the nature and laws of the ac-
tions of intelligent beings, these actions
being considered in relation to their moral
qualities; the science which treats of the
nature and grounds of moral obligation;
the science of human duty.
The whole of the moral sciences; nat-
ural jurisprudence, including moral phil-
osophy, international law, public or po-
litical law, civil law and history, profane,
civil, and political.
A particular system of principles and
rules concerning duty, whether true or
false; rules of practice in respect to a
single class of human actions: as social
ethics; newspaper ethics, professional
ethics.
Today Webster might add public rela-
tions to his definition.
Ethics as used today by engineers has
been prepared by the engineer's council
for professional-development and adopt-
ed by the National Society of Professional
Engineers, October 28, 1946, as canons
of ethics for engineers.
I quote the foreword of the canons of
ethics:
"Honesty, justice and courtesy form a
moral philosophy which, associated with
mutual interest among men, constitutes
j the foundation of ethics. The engineer
should recognize such a standard, not in
passive observance, but as a set of dy-
namic principles guiding his conduct and
way of life. It is his duty to practice his
profession according to these canons of
ethics.
As the keystone of professional conduct
is integrity, the engineer will discharge
his duties with fidelity to the public, his
employers and clients, and with fairness
and impartiality to all. It is his duty to
interest himself in public welfare, and to
be ready to apply his special knowledge
for the benefit of mankind. He should up-
hold the honor and dignity of his pro-
fession and avoid association with any
enterprise of questionable character. In
his dealings with fellow engineers he
should be fair and tolerant."
In order to acquaint you with the
canons of ethics, I should like to read the
following sections which deal with the
various areas of endeavors you will be
associated with in your future lives.
In professional life:
The engineer will cooperate in extend-
ing the effectiveness of the engineering
profession by interchanging information
and experience with other engineers and
students and by contributing to the work
of engineering societies, schools and the
scientific and engineering press.
He will not advertise his work or merit
in a self-laudatory manner, and he will
avoid all conduct or practice likely to dis-
credit or do injury to the dignity and
honor of his profession.
In your relations with the public:
The engineer will endeavor to extend
public knowledge of engineering and will
discourage the spreading of untrue, un-
fair, and exaggerated statements regarding
engineering.
He will have due regard for the safety
of life and health of the public and em-
ployees who may be affected by the work
for which he is responsible.
He will express an opinion only -when
it is founded on adequate knowledge and
honest conviction while he is serving as a
witness before a court, commission, or
other tribunal.
He will not issue ex-parte statements,
criticisms or arguments on matters con-
nected with public policy which are in-
spired or paid for by private interests,
unless he indicates on whose behalf he is
making the statement.
He will refrain from expressing pub-
licly an opinion on an engineering sub-
ject unless he is informed as to the facts
relating thereto.
In your relations with clients and em-
ployers:
The engineer will act in professional
matters for each client or employer as a
faithful agent or trustee.
He will act with fairness and justice
between his client or employer and the
contractor, when dealing with contracts.
He will guard against conditions that
are dangerous or threatening to life, limb
or property on work for which he is re-

The diagram, with a minimum number of reactors, illustrates cyclic
regeneration. Piping arrangement permits the swing reactor to substitute
for any other reactor in the system. High activity of catalyst is maintained
—without interrupting production—in the ULTRAFORMING process.
OW TO KEEP *l,000,000 WORT
OF CATALYST ON THE JOB
When you have a million dollars' worth of
platinum catalyst in a single refinery unit, you
hope you can keep it steadily on the job. That's
too much money to be standing around idle.
Also, you'd like to keep the catalyst working
at high efficiency.
Most catalysts lose activity with use. The
platinum that "reforms" 40-octane gasoline to
100-octane gasoline is no exception. And the
higher the octane number, the faster the cat-
alyst loses activity.
For years activity could be restored only by
taking the catalyst out of the unit and sending
it away for special treatment.To keep from hav-
ing too many of these shutdowns, refiners had
to operate at relatively low octane numbers.
Standard Oil research scientists came up
with a better answer. They developed a new
type of platinum catalyst, and they learned
how to regenerate it repeatedly—while it is
still in the unit. When a swing reactor is pro-
vided, the unit need not even be shut down.
The new process is called ULTRAFORMING.
During a year of ULTRAFORMING atTexas
City, one reactor was regenerated 53 times.
The unit is still producing 100-octane gasoline.
ULTRAFORMING also gives high yields of
by-product hydrogen. The hydrogen can be
used in upgrading other oil products. Or, it
can be reacted with nitrogen from the air to
make ammonia.
ULTRAFORMING is only one of the many
major achievements credited to the scientists
who have made careers at Standard Oil.

sponsible, or if he is not responsible, will
promptly call such conditions to the at-
tention of those who are responsible.
He will not accept compensation, finan-
cial or otherwise, from more than one
interested party for the same service, or
for services pertaining to the same work,
without the consent of all interested
parties.
He will not be financially interested in
the bids as or of a contractor on competi-
tive work for which he is employed as an
engineer unless he has the consent of his
client or employer.
In your relations with engineers:
The engineer will endeavor to protect
the engineering profession collectively
and individually from misrepresentation
and misunderstanding.
He will take care that credit for engi-
neering work is given to those to whom
credit is properly due.
He will not directly or indirectly injure
the professional reputation, prospects or
practice of another engineer. However, if
he considers that an engineer is guilty of
unethical, illegal or unfair practice, he
will present the information to the proper
authority for action.
He will exercise due restraint in criti-
cizing another engineer's work in public,
recognizing the fact that the engineering
societies and the engineering press pro-
vide the proper forum for technical dis-
cussions and criticism.
Finally, he will not become associated
in responsibility for work with engineers
who do not conform to ethical practices.
These are excerpts from the 28 rules
on canons of ethics.
One of today's live questions among
engineers is their professional status. Dean
Freund, dean of engineering at Univer-
sity of Detroit, a short time ago made the
following statements: "At the present
time employers recognize technical ability
and engineering competence but those are
not the sum and total of professional
standing. High honor and integrity are
equally essential, and it seems to me that
employers of engineers ought to be as
much concerned about the ethical stand-
ards of their engineering employees as
they are concerned about technical educa-
tion and ability. By ethical standards, I
mean the ethical codes of the engineering
profession and not any special policies or
regulations of any particular corporate
employer. These ethical codes are at-
tempts to embody in words the accepted
concepts of high honor and integrity in
the life work of engineers as professional
men."
Looking beyond the immediate area
which we have been discussing it seems
to me that the whole relationship between
regulatory codes, which we call law, and
ethical codes, which we call voluntary
responsibility, forms one of the most sig-
nificant aspects of current national con-
cern. The same problem we face here to-
day in a physical sense applies as well to
our entire social and economic structure,
and the question to be resolved is much
the same: How much is society to be pro-
tected by statute and how much by the
free will of its citizens? Here indeed, it
seems to me, is one of the basic issues of
our times.
Our whole concept of law is based on
the assumption that institutions, whether
political or commercial in character, exist
only for the mutual advancement of the
whole social structure. Those who seek
to reward themselves at the expense of
society generally must be punished. But
once we step outside the obvious area of
wrong-doing, the law contents itself with
the statement of objectives, and is silent

...WHICH DESIGN

or cast iron
THE first question you'd ask is . . .
does the design do the best job
at lowest cost? If not—why not.
Industry constantly asks why things
are done the way they are ... to see if
there is a better, less costly way.
One question is why shouldn't all
machinery be designed for welded
steel... when steel designs are strong*
er, more rigid, more rugged . . . yet
cost less to build.
By knowing how to use welded
steel, you hold the answers to many
designing problems. Here for example
is how one machine part is made for
43% less cost by a simple change from
cast iron to steel.

on methods for their implementation. The
great body of law under which we live
can therefore be considered as a boundary
limiting an area within which we are free
to exercise our powers of self-determina-
tion. Laws can prohibit, they may even
encourage, but they can never in them-
selves guarantee accomplishment.
Hence, the law must serve its most use-
ful purpose in establishing minimum
standards and in defining permissible tol-
erances. Yet few of us would be content
merely to conform to legal requirements,
and the measure of our citizenship, it
seems to me is the extent to which our
voluntary acts go beyond the mere legal-
istic behavior.
In order to explain the foregoing
statements the following law case is pre-
sented as an example. This case actually
occurred in Michigan. The names and
places have been changed to protect the
innocent. —Michigan Law Case—211
Michigan 149—Fender Company vs.
Walsh—These facts are presented:
The fender company was a manufac-
turer of fenders, hoods, and sheet metal
products. Mr. Walsh was a mechanical
and production engineer. Mr. Walsh was
employed by the Fender Company at a set
salary plus profits, to purchase steel and
many other things necessary to the com-
pany business.
The company needed 200 tons of steel,
and after much search, Walsh found 700
tons of steel which had to be purchased
as one lot. Knowing the company needed
the steel immediately, Walsh personally
took an option on the 700 tons and lo-
cated a buyer for the extra 500 tons. The
extra steel was sold by Walsh through
the efforts of a friend for considerable
above the purchase price and, consequent-
ly, Walsh gave his friend a portion of the
profit for his efforts. The Fender Com-
pany brought suit for the profits from the
500 tons, claiming Walsh was acting for
them, and, as they were responsible for
his acts, they should receive the profits.
A discussion of this case in accordance
with the facts presented indicates a di-
cision could be rendered in two
areas namely 1) ethics and 2) legal pro-
cedure under law of agency.
First let us discuss ethics:
Ethical actions by Mr. Walsh arc:
a. he acted fairly in his opinion for his
employer.
b. he acted in a manner to complete
the assignment directed to him by
his employer.
Unethical actions by Walsh:
a. Walsh did not make his status clear
to his employer on matters in which
he may have financial interest.
b. He will not accept compensation
financial or otherwise from more
than one interested party for the
same service or for services pertain-
ing to the same work without the
consent of all interested parties.
c. He will promptly disclose to his em-
ployer any interest in a business
which may compete with or affect
the business of his employer.
d. He will not allow an interest in any
business to affect his decision re-
garding engineering work for which
he is employed or which he may be
called upon to perform.
You may argue that since 200 tons of
steel was necessary for his company work
therefore, whatever action was necesary
to make the purchase of steel possible,
such action was the responsibility of
Walsh. Such argument is valid; however,
a personal option of 700 tons of steel
costing roughly $42,000 would require
acceptance by the steel company that
Walsh was a bonifide agent of the Fender
Company and that any such transaction
would have the approval of the Fender
company credit wise.
Considering ethics Walsh did not re-
ceive such approval by his company there-
fore he would be guilty by 3 counts of
unethical conduct.
In discussing this case under legal pro-
cedure under law of agency, several rules
or regulations in the eyes of the court are
mandatory such as:
A. There are two essential ele-
ments in an agency—
1. The agent acts, not for himself
but for another.
2. The agent's acts within the scope
of his authority must be binding
upon his principal (employer).
B. The principal (employer) is bound
by the acts of his agent so long as
the agent acts within the scope or
within the apparent scope of his
authority.
C. Whenever the agent exceeds his au-
thority he (the agent) is personally
liable.
D. The agent cannot represent both
parties to a transaction without the
knowledge of both.
E. The obligations of the agent to his
principal (employer) include loyal-
ty, obedience, judgment, skill and
honesty.
F. When an agent appoints a sub-agent
without knowledge of the principal,
the agent is personally liable for
the acts of the sub-agent.
On the basis of the essential elements
of an agency the Fender Company
brought suit and the court's decision was
as follows:
Decision—for the Fender Co., as one
who undertakes to act for another may
not act for himself in the same manner,
and all profits made by an agent in the
execution of an agency belong to the prin-
cipal. It does not matter whether or not
such profit or advantage be the result of
the performance or of the violation of the
duty of the agent, if it be the fruit of the
agency.
This situation is not an isolated case.
It has happened many times in purchasing
of materials. It might be interesting to
know that most purchasing of steel is now
done through brokerage firms when un-
usual or small requirements of steel arc
necessary.
In conclusion the statement that "ethi-
cal standards have a weight far greater
than the force of law," is true. If we are
honest, God-fearing individuals, whost
philosophy of life is based on Christianity
we shall be citizens whose standards will
be ethical in concept and decision.

The Importance of
Electrical Conductors
In the ability to transmit electricity, all
forms of matter may be divided into
two general classes, namely, conductors
and insulators. Conductors permit elec-
tric current to flow readily; that is,
they offer little resistance to its flow,
whereas, insulators offer relatively great
resistance to the flow of electricity. All
substances at normal temperatures of-
fer some resistance to the flow of
electric current. In general, the metals
are good conductors, while glass,
oil and most organic substances are
classed as insulators. Although silver
offers the lowest resistance to the flow
of electricity of the common metals, its
cost is such that it is not widely used as
a conductor. The conductors most gen-
erally used in the cable industry are
made of copper or aluminum.
The manner in which electricity flows
through elementary material may be
readily visualized from the modern con-
cepts of the structure of matter. Ac-
cording to these concepts all elements
are made up of minute indivisible part-
icles called atoms. These in turn are
composed of a positively charged nu-
cleus around which one or more very
small negatively charged particles,
called electrons, rotate at high velocity.
In conductors, some of these electrons
are free to move when only a small dif-
ference of potential is applied to the
ends of the conductor and, since they
are negatively charged, they flow to the
positively charged end. This movement
of electrons is electric current.
In passing through conductors, the elec-
trons must pass through the electron
fields of many atoms. They thus collide
with the atomic nuclei and other elec-
trons. These collisions obstruct the flow
of electrons and result in electrical re-
sistance.
The resistance of a homogeneous
conductor of uniform cross-sectional
area varies directly as its length and
inversely as its cross-section, the length
being in the direction of current flow.
That is, R = /&gt;L/A where, R is the re-
sistance in ohms, L is the length in the
direction of current flow, A is the area
perpendicular to the length and p is a
constant of the particular material
known as its specific resistivity. When
the length and area are expressed in the
same units such as L = one inch and
A = one square inch, R = p X 1/1 or
R = p, the specific resistance of the ma-
terial in ohms per inch cube.
The length and area of a conductor
are generally expressed in other units

than inches. The most commonly used
unit of cross-sectional area in the cable
industry is the circular mil, usually
designated as cir. mil or CM. This is
the area of a circle whose diameter is
one mil, 0.001 inch. The area of a cir-
cular mil is W4 or 0.7854 of a square
mil. The unit of length usually associ-
ated with this unit is the foot and the
resistance becomes ohms per CM-foot.
The resistance of annealed copper and
aluminum per circular mil-foot at 20C
are 10.371 and 17.011 ohms respec-
tively. The resistance of a copper con-
ductor 64 mils in diameter and one foot
long thus becomes 10.371 -4- 642 or
0.00253 ohms.
The sizes of electrical conductors are ex-
pressed in the United States in terms of
the American Wire Gauge. This was
originally set up on the basis of a geo-
metrical progression of 39 steps or sizes
between a wire 460 mils in diameter
(Size 410) and a wire 5 mils in diameter
(Size 36). The ratio of the diameter of
a wire to that of the next larger size in
this series is\^ 460/5 = 1.12293. This
ratio has since been used to extend the
American Wire Gauge (AWG) to sizes
smaller than 36 AWG (5 mils). The
sizes of conductors larger than 410 are
expressed in circular mil area. The size
of a conductor made up of a number
of wires is determined from the sum of
the circular mil areas of the individual
wires.
When current flows through a con-
ductor there is, according to Ohm's law,
a voltage drop of E = IR, where E is in
volts, I is in amperes and R is in ohms,
and power equal to EI watts is con-
verted to heat. Since E = IR, this power
converted to heat becomes IJR watts.
Electrical Wire &amp; Cable Department
These two factors, voltage drop and
conductor heating, are of prime impor-
tance in the design of conductors. Con-
ductors must be of sufficiently low re-
sistance that the voltage drop does not
become excessive. In good design this
voltage drop should not exceed 3 per
cent for power circuits or 1 per cent for
lighting circuits. The conductors should
also be large enough that, when carry-
ing their current, their temperature
does not exceed that for which their
insulation is designed. This rated cur-
rent is referred to as the current carry-
ing capacity. The current carrying
capacities of the various sizes of con-
ductors and installation conditions have
been established. It should be noted
that the temperature attained by a con-
ductor depends not only on the amount
of heat generated but also on the ther-
mal resistance of its surroundings.
In addition to providing satisfactory
voltage drop and current carrying ca
pacity, conductors must be designed to
provide adequate flexibility during in-
stallation and service. This is accom-
plished by building up the conductor
from one or more adequately small
wires, depending on the flexibility re-
quired. For example, the conductor for
heater cord or welding cable, which is
subject to repeated flexing in service, is
usually made up of copper strands hav-
ing a diameter of .005" or .0063", while
the conductor for overhead weather-
proof cable may be a single wire.

An Award Winning Paper
By LEONARD WILLIAMS, '56CE
ETIQUETTE RULES FOR
GRADUATING ENGINEERINGS
Webster's Dictionary defines ethics as
"the science of ideal human character."
How fitting it is that the word "science"
is used in this definition, since engineer-
ing is a profession which applies the
principles of the basic sciences to practical
problems. Beyond a doubt, ideal human
character is a science worth mastering.
This idea is set forth in the foreword to
the Canons of Ethics prepared by the
Engineers' Council for Professional De-
velopment where it reads:
"Honesty, justice, and courtesy
form a moral philosophy which, as-
sociated with mutual interest among
men, constitute the foundation of
ethics. As the keystone of profes-
sional conduct is integrity, the engi-
neer will discharge his duties with
fidelity to the public, his employers,
and clients, and with fairness and
impartiality to all."
There is no better time to start apply-
ing these principles to the public and
employers than when one is making his
first contacts and commitments with these
elements of society.
One point should be remembered by all
those seeking employment. Whether or
not there is a shortage of engineers, no
one is hiring people who are not, to put
it bluntly, "made out of something."
Governmental service and industry need
men who will face up to the challenges
of engineering problems and will stick
with a problem until it is completed.
This means that engineers must be de-
pendable. Honesty, justice, courtesy, and
dependability are the essential traits the
successful engineer must possess.
These same traits must govern the man-
ner in which the senior engineer makes
job commitments, for it is with these
commitments that he begins his perman-
ent record in society. This record follows
him all the days of his life, so he should
start it by holding to the same principles
that he must live up to all his engineering
life. Each one of these traits can be ap-
plied to some phase of making job com-
mitments.
Honesty is mentioned first because
everyone agrees that it is the highest
trait of human character to aim for. Hon-
esty implies a refusal to lie, steal, or de-
ceive in any way; such rectitude that one
is incapable of being false to a trust, a
responsibility, or a pledge. This trait ap-
plies to all phases of obtaining a job.
First, there are the statements on the ap-
plication, which must be correct. Did you
really quit that job, or were you fired?
Secondly, comes the interview. It is not
honest for one to say that he is interested
in a certain employer when he is ac-
tually just looking for anyone who will
hire him. Likewise, it is not honest for
one to say that he likes to work in a
certain part of the country when actually
he knows absolutely nothing about that
part of the country. Many young engi-

This year the public is being filled
with many facts and figures to prove that
the farmer is or is not holding his place
in the national economy. The reason, of
course- is that it is a presidential election
year. The Republicans would like to re-
main in power to continue the policies
which they have started since they took
over the administration four years ago.
The Democrats also desire control because
they feel their policies are best for the
country.
Why All the Fuss?
This paper will be confined to a major
issue in the campaign. That is the farm
problem, concentrating on the squabble
over price supports. The Republicans
favor a flexible system of supporting basic
crop prices based on supply and demand
in an effort to balance and maintain the
balance between consumption and produc-
tion. However, the Democrats advocate
rigid price support at 90 per cent of
parity. This is to provide a floor to pre-
vent any great fluctuations that would
cause any farm economic suffering. This
is the basic conflict. Both sides have
strong cases in defense.
There seems to be a trend towards
fewer farms. The assumption then fol-
lows that larger, more economical farms
are resulting as they absorb the smaller
ones. Some figures which will be given
later will show, on interpretation, this
trend. This is a major sub-point in the
disagreement and will be brought into
the discussion later.
A second major sub-point is the prob-
lem of surpluses. The government has had
to buy up great stocks of commodities
under the rigid support program. The re-
sult today is a burden of almost unman-
ageable excesses. In fact, $1 million a
day is currently being spent for storage
costs alone. The resultant figure of $365
million a year is more than the whole
farm program was ever to have cost in
its entire existence.1
A Brief History
In 1933, President Franklin D. Roose-
read
velt and his "New Deal" program ad-
ministered direct loans to cotton and corn
producers to uphold prices in this de-
pression period. The Commodity Credit
Corporation administered these loans
under the authority of the president as
obtained from the National Industrial
Recovery Act of 1933. Following this ac-
tion were several acts from 1938 through
1947 dealing mainly with war time emer-
gencies in crop production. These acts
were succeeded by the Agricultural Acts
of 1948 and 1949. In the Act of 1949,
there was a provision for flexible flexible
price supports for the six "basic" com-
imodities, (which included corn, wheat,
cotton, rice, peanuts and tobacco). How-
ever' that provision was never put into
effect as the Defense Production Acts of
1950 and 1952 continued 90 per cent of
parity price supports on the basics during
the Korean War.2
But, the Act of 1949 remained though
these later amendments were due to ex-
pire in 1955. Then the original flexible
supports were due to go into effect. This
is what happened as the acts were not re-
newed. Congress had also instituted
acreage controls and marketing quotas—
both being an attempt to restore the bal-
ance of production and consumption.
The phrase "90 per cent of parity" is
a complicated one and will not be taken
up in detail here. Essentially it means a
price that is fair to the producer in rela-
tion to the costs of production. It was
originally based on the so-called "ideal"
level of 1909-1914, but a new plan of
parity had been made into law in 1948
though it has been continually postponed.
It would base parity on the latest 10 year
period of the year involved. It is called
"modernized parity." This plan also in-
cluded a "transitional parity" which
would prevent any large price change in a
short time as the switch was made from
the old to the modernized parity.3
Just recently a new farm measure pass-
ed by Congress was vetoed by President
Eisenhower. It included a return to 90
per cent of parity supports which was
not favored by his administration. How-
ever, it did include other proposals which
he had advocated. The major one is a
"soil bank" plan which was another at-
tempt to get the farmers to reduce produc-
tion. Its aim was to pay farmers for land
they took out of production and or put
to conservation purposes. Thus, it would
benefit the nation in reducing production,
the farmer in assuring some income from
the unused land and the conservation of
natural resources.
The Parmer's Condition
From the myriad of available facts and
figures, we can separate a few to show
how the farmer stands. In 1930, 25 per
cent of the population produced the na-
tion's farm products while now 13 per
cent does the same.4 Forty-nine per cent
of the total farms today produce 90 per
cent of the total farm output." Moreover,
farm debt is only second to that of the
depression of the 30s; mortgages are high
and farm income was 6.7 billion less in
1955 than the 17.7 billion peak of 1948
although the cost of living has skyrocket-
ed." On the other side of the picture,
farms have a higher resale value than ever
before, farmers have a record number of
conveniences and the amount of total per
farm assets are the second highest on
record.7 An examination of these figures
shows the basis of the trend towards
fewer farms. For instance, only less than
half the total number of farms produce
close to all the commodities. The mean-
ing of the increased debt can be seen in
comparison with the number of conven-
iences and total assets. The farmer is in-
vesting and risking more yet saving less
and even going into debt. Of course, the
decrease in farm population shows that
modern farm methods now require less
human labor.
THE ARGUMENT WITH THE PROS
AND CONS
Both sides agree that the world de-
pends greatly on the American farm. Sen.
Alexander Wiley of Wisconsin, though a
Republican- favors rigid supports. He
has stated that the farmer must be as-
60

sured of profit to take on the world's bur-
dens as ". . . the American farmer is
carrying on his back the European farmer,
the South American farmer and the free-
world's city dwellers as well." 8 President
Eisenhower declared in his 1954 farm
message to Congress that "A stable, pros-
perous and free agriculture is essential
to the welfare of the United States."'
As mentioned previously, the main
point of difference is rigid versus flexible
price supports on the basic commodities.
Under this falls the trend toward larger,
less personal farms and the accumulated
surpluses. Both of these latter two points
are important in the arguments which fol-
low.
Inasmuch as the Republicans are cur-
rently in power, this paper will put them
on the defensive with their policies. The
issue will be taken up roughly in the form
of a debate with the so-called five stock
issues of debate forming the subheads.
The separation line of Democrat and Re-
publican is a crude one as this is not so
much a political issue as a battle between
rural and urban areas. Thus, a Republi-
can, if he is from a farm state, may favor
rigid supports while the administration
itself advocates flexible supports. The
same holds for certain Democratic mem-
bers of Congress also, as they may side
with the administration.
Is There a Need for a New Plan?
Here is where we will see the emphasis
on the sub-issues of surpluses and the
small farm.
The Republican's stand is that a new
plan is absolutely necessary to preserve
the ft/lure of farming. Today the nation
is under a glut of over-production caused
by an unbalanced market. If these sur-
pluses were released on the market, they
would choke off agriculture completely as
sufficient commodities are stored to last
the nation a full year.1" The attractions
for the farmer under rigid supports are
natural. The farmer continues to produce
great quantities of a crop that he is as-
sured of getting a good price. This causes
the unbalanced market as there is no

crop. Over-production also upsets the
whole farm economic picture. For ex-
ample, the nation could use more pigs.
However, the farmer would rather sell
his feed corn to the government for a
guaranteed price than feed it to the pigs.
This results in a lack of pigs that causes
an unduly high market price due to a
lack of the animals. Likewise, it causes a
surplus of corn. Democratic Senator Clin-
ton P. Anderson of New Mexico- (Secre-
tary of Agriculture from 1945 to 1948),
agrees with the administration program.
He has stated that ". . . price supports
should assist the farmer in an orderly
marketing of his crop." " Thus, it is the
future that is being stressed by the Re-
publicans as the need for a change in
policy. The prosperity of the farmer,
(and the natiort), depends on establishing
a consumer-producer balance though the
change may be painful.
The Democratic point of view is that
the farmer needs help now.1'- The shift
from farm to city is caused simply by the
inability of a small or young farmer to
make a living. The small, family-type
farm is an age-old institution upon which
over 50 per cent of the farm population
depend for their livelihood, (note prev-
ious figures). These farmers could not be
transplanted to an urban society over-
night. Until this change comes about,
rigid supports must provide a minimum
price floor at 90 per cent of parity. (The-
oretically, 100 per cent of parity is a
price that the farmer can only break even
on). Also, are surpluses such a blight on
the nation? We are now living in a very
tense world when war is not impossible.
Surpluses have proven helpful in aiding
our unprepared allies in war times. If the
surpluses were released on the market
they would bring back the days of the
30s. That period forced the farmer out
for lack of a market due to a national lack
of prosperity. The farmer has also been
observed to be the first to feel the effects
of a depression with the rest of the na-
tion following. Thus, he should be the
best protected. In summary of the Demo-
crat's view: the emphasis is on the imme-
diate help needed for the small farmer.
Until this type of farmer vanishes, rigid
price supports are necessary to avoid a de-
pression.
Will the New Plan Solve the Trouble?
The new plan stated by the Republican
administration would eventually give the
farmer 100 per cent of parity as natural
forces of supply and demand take over.
This, of course, would solve all the
present ills. While the future may look
black in the days of transition, this is the
only method that can result in a perman-
ent cure. Again, the balance of production
and consumption must be attained so that
natural factors can set the price on a level
with the overall national economy. Proof
that it will do the job can be made by an
example. Cattle are not a price-supported
commodity. Yet their market price has in-
creased almost 21/2 fold between 1951
and 1953.1:1 The answer is that cattle on
the range or unborn don't affect the mar-
ket. The producers have automatically ad-
justed to the demand. This can be used as
an analogy to the wheat industry—wheat
not raised cannot affect the market.
The Democrats question the use of an
untried plan. If the new plan would give
the farmer 100 per cent of parity any-
way, why not just stick to the old, proven
rigid support plan? The new plan may
solve a future problem but it would only
create a new problem in the cities. The
cities would become filled with broken
farmers that had been squeezed out. This
stresses the need for a gradual transition
and the maintenance of rigid supports
until the transition is made.
Will the Proposed Plan Work?
Flexible supports are the only workable
way in the Republican's viewpoint. The
market balance must be achieved for uni-
form prosperity for both the rural and
urban dweller. As further proof of its
practicality, note the example of the
cattle price increase mentioned earlier.
After the transition, the farmer will re-
ceive his full share. Farm production thus
far has been only kept in line by the un-
usual demands of war. Other countries
are becoming more self-dependent so
we are losing this market. As we lose
these markets, adjustments must be made
to allow for less consumption.
In direct contrast, the Democrats claim
that this is not the practical way. This
plan places the great importance of the
farmer as dependent on the changing eco-
nomic factors and commodity demands
of only our nation. This should not be.
The American farmer should be subsi-
dized to guarantee his profit in the light
of this world-wide value. Thus, it would
be better to rely on the tested and prov-
en method of rigid supports.

It was a dark and dreary afternoon
when the U.S.S. slipped down
the ways at the Newport News shipyard,
but despite the threatening weather, a
large crowd was present to see the birth
of this new ship. On the christening
platform were high-ranking officers of
the Navy Department, officials of the
shipyard, and the wife of the mayor of
Williamsburg to christen the new ship.
The bottle of champagne had a groove
filed completely around it to insure break-
age at the slightest impact. The Navy
band played through its numbers, speeches
were made, and now came the time for
the launching. The noise and confusion
was reduced to an absolute quiet. The
woman took hold of the bottle and, after
saying, 'I christen thee U.S.S. ,"
smashed the bottle against the ship's bow.
At that instant the ship began to move
and a loud cheer rose from the crowd as
she went down the ways, for here was
the birth of a grand and new ship.
In all probability, most of you are of
the opinion that the launching of this
ship was a rather simple and easy opera-
tion. I grant you that the actual launching
itself is merely a transfer of the vessel
from the building stocks to the water, but
there are problems that must be faced
prior to a launching that are numerous
and involved. Preparations must be made
even before the construction of the ship
is begun. Although the stern-end launch-
ing method is not the only one employed,
it is the most common. Therefore, I will
limit this discusion to this method, which
is shown in Figure 1.
The preparation of a shipway, or berth,
is one of the most important operations
in shipbuilding, since it is this construc-
tion which must be depended upon to
support the vessel while being built and to
transport the ship to the water. The ways,
shown in Figure 1, are those parts of the
shipway that convey the ship to the water.
The ship is transferred from the building
supports to these just prior to the launch-
ing and therefore must be strong enough
to absorb the weight of the vessel and
the cradle in which the ship is resting.
The foundation must also be of sufficient
strength to support all this weight; there-
fore, since the ground under these ship-
ways is usually soft, the shipway must be
extensively piled. These piles are driven
into the ground to a depth of about 30
to 50 feet. Sometimes there are as many
as 6,000 piles under a shipway, closely
spaced about 2 feet 6 inches apart; the)
not only take the weight of the vessel
and shipway but are also called upon
to resist the pivoting load that is thrown
upon them at a certain period of the
launching.
The pivoting load is the concentrated
weight of the vessel and cradle at the way
ends. Pivoting occurs when there isn't
enough buoyancy at the stern of the ship
to lift it off the ways. An illustration of
this is shown in Figure 2.
Fig. 3—Ship pivoting. Load on fore poppet is the difference between
the upward buoyancy force and the weight of the vessel.

There are times when the buoyancy at the
stern overcomes the weight and raises the
vessel before pivoting about the way ends
can occur. This causes the vessel to pivot
on the fore poppet, as shown in Figure
3. The fore poppet is a massive, strongly
built support made for the sole purpose
of withstanding the large, concentrated
load that is impinged on it when this
pivoting condition results.
To provide maximum slippage between
the sliding and standing ways, a lubricant
is used. This lubricant can be either
bananas or soft grease. If bananas are
used, they are usually packed to a thick-
ness of about two inches between the
ways. Soft grease is used in conjunction
with stearine, a material applied hot and
smoothed onto the standing ways with
hot irons. When cool, this material pre-
sents a hard, waxy surface. The soft
grease is placed on top of the stearine,
thus affording a slippery surface. Figure 4
shows the sliding and standing ways be-
tween which the lubricant is placed.
The keel blocks and their position dur-
ing construction are shown in Figure 4.
These keel blocks absorb the majority of
the weight of the ship during construc-
tion. A common method of removing
the keel blocks is as follows. Along the
upper, outboard edge of each sliding way-
is placed a row of oak wedges, each
wedge being long enough to more than
span the entire width of its sliding way.
On top of these wedges are placed the
wedge riders, which are usually timbers
set fore and aft and are about equal in
size to the sliding ways. The space be-
tween the wedge riders and the bottom
of the ship is then filled with wood pack-
ing, neatly fitted into place. Several hours
before launching, the wedges are driven
in with mauls and wooden battering rams
by squads of men on each side. These
battering rams are timbers of about six
to eight feet long and have rope lines
secured to them. A crew of four or six
men swing the ram so that the end of it
strikes the wedge, driving it tightly.
Figure 4 shows the wedges, wedge riders,
and ways. These wedges facilitate the
removal of the keel block and shores so
that the weight of the ship is transferred
entirely to the cradle. Only the releasing
gear now prevents the vessel from sliding
down into the water.
Releasing arrangements are of many
ingenious types, a few of them being the
hydraulic trigger arrangement, the ar-
rangement making use of a sole piece, and
another method utilizing a guillotine.
The hydraulic trigger arrangement,
which is used with large vessels, is illu-
strated in Figure 5. There is one trigger
for each standing way and each trigger
has a fluid pump line attached to it,
which, in turn, is attached to a main
pump line. This main line leads to a hy-
draulic hand pump which can be oper-
ated by one man. For the launching, the
operator pumps up a pressure in the
lines, which, in turn, applies a pressure
on the trigger piston. The piston pushes
the releasing arm away from its holding

position and the sliding way is free to
move.
The arrangement using the sole pieces
is utilized with both small and large ves-
sels. This arrangement is shown in Fig-
ure 6. The sole pieces are steel plates
with a row of drilled holes, as shown
at the cut line. These plates, located
at each standing way, are burned through
with acetylene torches to effect the release.
At the signal, each cutter burns the plate
to the first hole and stops. Both cutters
must cut at the same speed. At the next
signal, they cut to the next hole. This op-
eration is continued until both cutters
reach a point at which the force of the
vessel wanting to slide down the ways
overcomes the strength of the remaining
part of the sole pieces and the pieces rip
apart. There are times when one sole
piece may have more strength than the
other and even though they are burned
evenly, one can rip before the other. At
this moment the cutting operator really
has to start working for his living and cut
through the sole piece or reach the tear-
ing point before the one sliding way gets
too much of a head start on the other. If
this happens, the shipway could very pos-
sibly be damaged and cause serious in-
jury to the vessel. Although this pos-
sibility is always present, it seldom hap-
pens and the vessel usually slides down
the ways without a mishap.
The guillotine method is usually used
with small vessels. Here, manila rope is
the medium which prevents the vessels
from sliding down the ways. There are a
number of these lines at each standing
way, enough to hold the ship. At a given
signal, the guillotines are set into motion,
the lines are cut, and the ship goes on its
merry way.
With the stern-end and side launching
methods, the vessel's speed must be
checked and stopped after she has left
the ways. To accomplish this, huge manila
hawsers (large diameter ropes) are made
fast to the hull before launching. The
ends of these lines are secured to heavy
chains on shore which are laid in piles at
intervals. The lengths of the manila haw-
sers and the positions at which they are
fastened to the hull are such that the total
weight of the chains is not utilized all at
once. Each chain is utilized separately at
certain intervals and added to the weight
of the chains previously taken up. Thus,
the vessel's speed is checked and she
eventually is stopped.
It is a great sight and a wonderful
feeling to watch the launching of a ship,
especially if you had something to do
with the designing or building of her. If
any of you ever have the opportunity to
be present at a launching, don't turn the
opportunity away because it is a thrilling
experience and one which you would not
quickly forget.

Marquardt, the leader in super-
sonic propulsion, has inaugurated
a program of Individual Profes-
sional Development for its engi-
neers. You can help us maintain
this leadership for the future of
supersonic propulsion.
I. P. D. gives ouc engineers a
chance to advance to their maxi-
mum potential in their present
fields... and those beyond... in a
climate of continuing profes-
sional growth from in-plant
courses and more than fifty cur-
rent courses in Southern Califor-
nia's leading universities. New
courses are constantly being
added.
I. P. D. differs in its concept and
objectives from ordinary com-
pany training programs in that it
gives each engineer an opportu-
nity to grow and plan his devel-
opment toward his own goal
and at his own pace rather than
having to follow a rigid pre-
determined pattern.
I.P.D. is part of an overall expan-
sion program which anticipates a
two-fold increase in personnel
during the current year. This
increase represents many addi-
tional engineering opportunities.

10 years from now
will you be proud
of your decision?
The right decision now, at the launch-
ing of your career, can do much to
influence your success.
Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company has
a host of fine young men who are hold-
ing responsible positions in the PPG
organization. Ten years ago, many of
them were faced with the same decision
that now faces you: "Which company
shall I select?"
They chose PPG because it offers
unlimited opportunity. PPG has never
stopped expanding or growing in its
73 years of existence. Its markets are
constantly increasing. PPG's manage-
ment is progressive. It seeks men who
can grow with the company . . . men
who can take over responsibilities. In
PPG, it isn't necessary to wait for a
man's retirement or death before you
move up in the ranks. Opportunities
are opening up all the time in all of its
important divisions: Paint, Glass,
Chemicals, Brushes, Fiber Glass.
This is your year of decision. We
invite you to look into Pittsburgh Plate
Glass Company. To help you become
better acquainted with PPG, we sug-
gest you get a copy right away of the
booklet entitled, "Toward New Hori-
zons with Pittsburgh Plate." Ask your
placement officer for a copy or write
directly to the Pittsburgh Plate Glass
Company, General Personnel Director,
One Gateway Center, Pittsburgh 22,
Pennsylvania.

(Continued from page 62)
Is It Fair to Rural and Urban People?
The Republicans view their plan as
fair to the farmer, especially to the effi-
cient farmer. It would also be fair to the
consumer who would not be paying twice
for his commodities—that is, on the
market and in government sponsored
price support operations. These operations
do not pay for themselves. Commodities
may spoil and then they must be dis-
posed of at a loss. The profit of the
farmer, just like anyone else, should be
determined by the prosperity of the na-
tion. So, when the farmer's profit is de-
pendent on demand, and the demand is
created by the consumer which is de-
pendent on his own profit, a balanced
economic system could be maintained.
The plan is unfair in the Democratic
view because it would so adversely affect
the small farmer and favor the growth
of the big farmer. As the farmer suffers,
the nation suffers. For example, if a farm-
er's income is poor, then he has no money
for purchasing machinery. This, then, af-
fects the small town merchant, the whole-
saler and right up to the worker in the
machinery factory as he is laid off for lack
of work. A small farmer can't increase
his efficiency when he can't afford modern
machinery. He then appears stuck in a
rut that leads to inevitable ruin. In con-
trast, the large, corporate farm can absorb
fluctuations in prices for his production
because he operates on a greater margin
of profit. Likewise, he can take greater
risks and buy farm machinery even in
poor times.
Is There a Better Plan?
The four arguments mentioned above
may overlap in many points, yet each
would naturally do so as the controversy
is not as greatly split as it may seem. The
basis, of course, is the singular dispute
over the type of price supports on the six
basic commodities. Most of the other
differences hinge on this conflict. The fol-
lowing two paragraphs will briefly sum-
marize the Republican plan as it is per-
tinent to this paper and also relate the
alternate plan as proposed by the Demo-
crats.
In order for the Republicans to estab-
lish their flexible price support system,
they have recognized that they must first
eliminate the surpluses. They propose to
do this by trading it abroad, using it for
emergency relief operations or dispens-
ing it through government projects such
as school lunches. All these, and other
operations, would be isolated from in-
juring the free market. When the sur-
pluses are at a reasonable level, the favor-
able effect of flexible supports will be felt.
The support price will vary as to demand.
If there is a high demand and a small
crop, the Department of Agriculture will
raise the support price to stimulate pro-
duction. Conversely, if there is too great
a production, the department will reduce
support prices to discourage production.
Thus, farm prices would be directly af-
fected by supply and demand. The soil
bank would serve to hasten the reduction
of surpluses, and no other farm restric-
tions would be necessary.
The Democrats propose rigid supports
at 90 per cent of parity in their plan.
These rigid supports would last until the
small farmer is no more or until he could
take price fluctuations. Surpluses would
be disposed of by finding new markets,
new uses or various other methods. How-
ever, this matter would be secondary to
maintaining rigid supports. Their claim
is that production would be controlled by
the voluntary acceptance by farmers of
restrictions such as acreage allotments and
marketing quotas.
SUMMARY OF THE TWO SIDES—
WHO'S RIGHT?
The Republicans are steadfastly main-
taining that the future is all important in
any farm plan. Oppositely, the Demo-
crats say the here-and-now should be first
in view. Both recognize the world im-
portance of the American farmer. This
importance should cause both sides to
give serious consideration and thought
to both proposals. The farm is considered
as an industry on the same level as any
manufacturer. Subsidies to the farm in
1954 amounted to $520 million. This in-
cluded other plans besides price supports
such as school lunches, etc. However,
business in the same year received $1,063
million in subsidies." A common ex-
ample of a business subsidy is the one
given to the airlines to aid their expense
burden in air mail services.
It is true, the farm today is not up with
the rest of the nation in prosperity. But
what is the cause? Both parties have two
conflicting viewpoints which lead to their
policies. Unmanageable surpluses can cer-
tainly be considered a scourge. But should
some of it be saved for times of crisis
or is that issue of imediate importance?
Or, would the sudden transition of the
rural person to the city cause more ad-
verse effects than good ones? All this and
more is a matter of interpretation. Vari-
ous factors including time, the election,
world conditions and policy changes will
determine the outcome.

neering.
If industry is to have more graduates in
engineering to choose from, it should en-
courage more students to enter the field
by offering information, such as case
studies, to show young people what engi-
neering is and what we do. Some schol-
arships are now being provided by tech-
nical societies, associations, individuals
and industry. Much more effective help in
the form of scholarships and publicity is
needed from industry.
What characteristics in addition to the
technical training are desired by industry
in the graduating engineer? We often
hear about the need for ability to express,
clearly and concisely, one's ideas both
orally and in writing. Report writing is a
necessity. A familiarity with economics,
politics, history, literature, music, and
sport is desirable. Moral integrity, dignity,
personality, neatness, poise and respect
for others are fundamental requirements.
Leadership, ability to work with others
and extra-curricular activities are stressed.
Scholarship is, of course, invariably at
the head of the list.*'5
Many of the personal characteristics are
beyond the normal scope of the Univer-
sity or College training, although efforts
in many directions are made to improve
the desirable characteristics and discour-
age others. In addition to the control and
example of the instructor, there are avail-
able speech societies, student branches of
national engineering societies, such as
ASME, ASTE, ASM, AFS, SAE, etc., all
of which have programs, prepared by the
students themselves with the help of the
faculty, with local and outside speakers.
Social gatherings and plant trips, movies
on engineering developments, etc. are
other methods for giving the student a
better understanding of his work and
position. Many work on student publica-
tions or are associated with fraternities
and honorary societies, all of which, as
extra-curricular activities, consume most
of their free time. The University is most
anxious to train the student in every way
possible to fit him best for his life work
and the co-operation of industry is most
welcome.

wiring of the circuit, but also many new
processes are being used which apply
printed resistors, condensers, coils, etc.
Resistors can be applied by the use of
inks, special tapes made of carbon black,
and base materials. Condensers are made
by simply printing on both sides of the
board and using the board as the insula-
tor. The making of coils means designing
the circuitry in such a way that the con-
ductors run in a spiral which is printed
with the regular conductors. One of the
tricks used to make the resistances very
accurate in value is to overprint and
grind away the excess until the correct
value is reached. Fortunately, few resis-
tors need be that accurate.
With the dawn of automation, the
printed circuit is coming into its own.
Since it lends itself so well to automatic
assembly, in the future more and more
will be heard about it.

neers get off to the wrong start by accept-
ing a job in a part of the country that they
are not familiar with and then quitting
shortly because they do not like the
weather or some other geographical fea-
ture. Third, in order of time sequence,
but most important is the acceptance of
an offer. When the letter from the pros-
pective employer comes, offering a job,
it will have a statement something like
this: "This offer will be held open until
April 30, 1956 for your decision. . . .
Upon acceptance of our offer, you will
be expected to report for work two weeks
after graduation." The tendency, when
one gets his first offer, is to reply right
away with an acceptance. But there is
also the viewpoint of the employer to
consider. The employer had the words
"decision" and "acceptance" in there on
purpose. Once he has received a letter of
acceptance, he understands that the ap-
plicant has made his decision and will
live up to the rest of the sentence,
". . you will . . . report for work . . It is
not honest to send a letter of acceptance,
knowing full well that, if a higher offer
comes, the first offer will be disregarded.
The best policy is to wait until all offers
are in and then make an intelligent and
final decision.
When making that final decision, one
must do justice to both the employer and
himself. This refers primarily to job suit-
ability. One is not doing justice to either
himself or the prospective employer when
he accepts a job knowing full well that
either he does not like the work, or is
not qualified to assume the position offer-
ed him.
It is a matter of common sense to be
courteous in all contacts. If one is pres-
sured by a prospective employer for a
decision, it is certainly fitting to write
him telling him that his offer is not the
only one under consideration, but that he
will be notified of the final decision as
soon as it is made. When the final deci-
sion is made, a letter should be sent to
those whose offers were not accepted,
thanking them for their offers, and hop-
ing to be of assistance to them in the
future. It is bad business to begin a ca-
reer by leaving prospective employers
"hanging in the air." One must not for-
get that he never knows when he might
have to ask one of the prospective em-
ployers, whose offer he rejected, for a job.
He certainly stands a much better chance
of getting a job when he asks for one if
he rejected the first offer in a courteous
manner than if he did not.
Dependability is simply a matter of
living up to all obligations. Once one has
given an employer his word that he will
report for work on a specified date, he is
obligated to do so. Any new develop-
ments, such as a draft notice, should be
reported to the employer at once. This
is also a matter of courtesy.
In conclusion, a senior should handle
his job commitments in such a manner
that when he writes an employer: "I am
pleased to accept your offer of a position
as associate engineer and I will report
for work June 30, 1956," he will be
there, with a clean slate. All other pros-
pective employers will be aware of their
positions and the young engineer will be
ready to help man improve his environ-
ment "with fairness and impartiality to
all."

ERI Report Outlines Distribution of
$8 Million in Research
Eight million dollars in research—
ranging from explorations of the atom to
studies of the upper atmosphere and from
guided missile design to noise reduction
in battleships—is outlined in the annual
report of the University of Michigan's
Engineering Research Institute (ERI).
The report tells of 334 governmental
and industrial research projects handled
by the Institute during 1953-54, many of
them of vital importance to the national
defense effort.
Directed by Dr. Richard G. Folsom,
ERI is a 34-year-old administrative unit
that funnels sponsored research work to
faculty members, mainly in the CoIIege
of Engineering and physical sciences, and
to its own staff of technicians.
Supersonic wind tunnels, powerful ra-
diation sources, atom smashers, electronic
brains, and modern laboratories were uti-
lized by 1,711 full and part-time workers
during the year, the report notes.
The amount of research sponsored by
industry increased by 21 per cent over the
previous year, while government-support-
ed work dipped about six per cent, in
keeping with a nation-wide trend. The
total dollar volume of research represents
a decrease of less than five per cent from
the figure reported a year ago, it is point-
ed out.
Of the 334 projects underway during
the year, 17 of them grouped under the
classifications of Operations Research,
System Analysis and Design, and Com-
munications were valued at $4,428,638,
more than half the total.
Although wrapped in secrecy, the three
Operations Research projects totaling two
million dollars are described as being
"in answer to a need felt by the armed
forces for basic research in the means of
handling problems of efficient utilization
of forces and supplies." They touch upon
such topics as optimum submergence tac-
tics of submarines, aerial combat, and the
prediction of future aircraft positions
from radar plots, the report observes.
The University of Michigan, as one of
the first schools to offer instruction in
System Analysis and Design, stands in
the forefront of the field, according to the
report. The studies relate to the increas-
ingly complex and large-scale systems
used in communications, transportation,
business, industry, science and warfare.
ERI's largest division, the Willow Run
Research Center, has specialized in the
design of military systems. It is reported
that "considerable effort has gone into
the design of guided missile systems for
air defense. Such systems involve target
surveillance (search, detection, tracking,
identification), preparation and launch-
ing of missiles, guidance and control, co-
ordination of multiple attacks, communi-
cation computation, and evaluation."
Five projects amounting to over a mil-
lion dollars were conducted during the
year in the System Analysis and Design
category.
Research on nine projects under the
broad classification of Communications
totaled $800,000 The studies included in-
vestigations on human response to stimuli
from electronic equipment, telemetering
as applied to upper-atmosphere research,
and development of new types of air-
search radar systems and of infrared de-
vices for communication other than radio.
The infrared is an invisible region of
the spectrum just beyond the visible
red. Efforts were made to develop ship-to-
ship and ship-to-shore infrared communi-
cation devices for use during periods of
radio silence. At the same time, measures
for the detection of infrared radiation
from enemy ships were explored.
The report gathers all projects under
22 broad engineering concepts. Some of
these categories and the contributions
made under them to industry and the gov-
ernsent include:
Soil Mechanics—Detailed analyses by
ERI technicians of soil characteristics at a
proposed building site enabled a large
steel company to avoid construction of a
$5,500,000 foundation.
High-Speed Computers—Capable of
solving problems 20,000 times as fast as
a desk calculator, the MIDAC computer
at Willow Run Research Center was used
for a variety of tasks, including the simu-
lation of navigation and steering criteria
to aid in the design of guided missiles, a
compilation of the thermodynamic prop-
erties of the important chemical chlorine,
and mechanical design of a jet engine.
Combustion—In the vital field of jet-
fuel combustion, a group is planning
equipment to simulate altitudes from sea
level to 80,000 feet so as to better study
nozzle designs for injecting fuel into jet
engines.
Human Engineering—-"The study of
the fundamental features of body geome-
try has the objective of assisting the Air
Force to design cockpits and locate con-
trols knobs and levers in airplanes so is

small parts needed for a single engine
within a particular section of the line are
brought in a plastic tray. Carried to the
line by an overhead conveyor system,
these trays are color-coded to indicate
what section of the line each tray is in-
tended for. At the beginning of the line,
the operator removes a tray designated for
Section 1 from the tray conveyor and
places it between two cylinder blocks
starting along the final assembly machine.
At the completion of the assembly opera-
tions in section 1, the emptied tray is re-
moved and placed in a homeward bound
hanger on the overhead conveyor.
A special automatic unit lifts the en-
gine from the end of Section 1 and low-
ers it onto another pallet for its trip
through Section 2. The pistons to be in-
stalled are brought in matched sets by
overhead conveyor, which descends and
travels immediately over Section 2 of the
automated line. The overhead conveyor is
synchronized with the assembly machine,
so that one set of pistons moves in unison
with a particular engine on the line. This
permits the pistons to be removed from
the conveyor hanger one at a time and
installed in matched sets without any con-
fusion arising.
This machine has proven that an auto-
mated assembly line is a distinct advant-
age in the final assembly of car engines.
A higher quality product and less worker
fatigue are but a few of the results of the
two automation systems described here.
As time passes, automation will find more
and wider applications throughout the
automobile and allied industries. It is in-
evitable.
The Future?
// is true that automation uill makt
some inroads on the availability of jobs.
However, the labor unions' fear of the
concept is not justified when the history
of machinery and labor is objectively
viewed. When the cotton mill workers of
northern England wrecked the automatic
looms during the Luddite Rebellion of
1811-16, they were protesting, in effect,
technological unemployment, described by
economist Adam Smith a few years
earlier. But examine the life of the aver-
age mill worker today. There is a definite
improvement in his lot over that of a
century ago, and yet technology has pre-
dominated in this industry-, as well as all
others. A lesson is here for those who
oppose the introduction and widespread
use of automation. In the final analysis,
all technology, meaning automation also,
eventually benefits the working man.
INDUSTRIES THAT MAKE AMERICA GREAT
TEXTILES . . .
SPINNING FABULOUS YARNS
The textile industry—through its variety
of processes and products—plays one of
the most significant roles in the everyday
lives and activities of all Americans. To-
day, efficient men, methods and machines
produce yarns and fabrics for an almost
endless list of products of which clothing,
carpets, drapes, tires, belting, shoes and
furniture are but a sample. With hearten-
ing regularity, textile manufacturing ad-
vances are being made, new fibers and
blends created, and new applications de-
veloped.
Pacing textile industry progress is an
intensive research program. Synthetics now
are as familiar and serviceable as cotton,
wool and other natural fibers, and have
freed us from any dependence upon im-
ports such as silk. Concentrated develop-
ment of the industry's manufacturing pro-
cesses has brought new techniques and
methods to improve and speed up the
transformation of raw fiber into finished
material.
But not content with the dynamic prog-
ress already made, the textile industry is
continuing to reinvest earnings to insure
further advances. It is enlisted—with its
suppliers and processors—in a never-end-
ing effort to improve machines and methods.
An important requirement in this second
largest industry in America is steam, used
in textile plants for power, processing and
heating. The B:ibcock &amp; Wilcox Company,
whose experience with steam extends over
nearly a century, has long been a contribu-
tor to textile industry progress. B&amp;W
boilers and associated equipment are being
improved constantly as B&amp;Ws research
and engineering facilities devote time, ef-
fort and money to help make better boilers
for all industry. The Babcock &amp; Wilcox

are expected in the fields of automobile
design, industrial worker efficiency, sports,
and the design of artificial limbs."
Acoustics—Investigations have extend-
ed from noise reduction in the smallest
types of motors to components of the
largest battleships. The work included re-
duction of noise at its source, isolation of
sources, and research on transmission and
absorption of sound by various materials.
Machinability—A study of the grind-
ing processes used in the manufacture of
aircraft landing gear explained unpre-
dictable failures of the part.
Nuclear Energy—Much work was car-
ried out with the goal of finding possible
uses for the "ashes," or fission products,
of nuclear reactors. A facility for using
fission products to irradiate pork on a
commercial scale was designed, and would
make trichinosis "a thing of the past" if
employed by the packing industry.
Meteorology—Measures for the control
of gases from industrial smokestacks were
set forth, following wind tunnel experi-
ments with scale models of the buildings
and surrounding terrain.
New, Supersonic Dust-Detector
Resembles Housewife's Vacuum
Cleaner
A highly sensitive dust-recording in-
strument, believed to be the fastest of its
kind, has been developed in Kodak Re-
search Laboratories as part of the com-
pany's continual campaign for purity of
air in film manufacturing.
The new instrument is so fast it gives
an accurate measure of dust conditions
within seconds, and can provide a con-
tinuous record of dust levels. It is sensi-
tive enough so that if a few thousandths
of an inch of fine dust on the head of a
pencil are dispersed through an average
room, 8 by 10 by 15 feet, the recorder
will detect its presence.
The instrument has a general resem-
blance to a vacuum cleaner for household
use. But, unlike the cleaner, the dust re-
corder sucks in air through a narrow
tube and blows it at supersonic speed
against a thin plastic sheet.
Dust in the air is deposited in a nar-
row strip on the plastic sheet. Then a
photoelectric "eye" reads the dust track
for instrument measurement of its den-
sity. The resultant record of the dust level
is traced on graph paper for a permanent
record.
With the addition of a microscope, a
scientist can also make a swift examina-
tion of the dust trail by eye. He can make
a preliminary judgment, for example, as
to whether the magnified dust is lint or
metallic in origin. More complete chemi-
cal or microscopic analysis of the dust
can be made later, over a period of sev-
eral hours, by regular laboratory methods.
The dust recorder also proves useful to
check the effectiveness of air filtering
systems. Samples of air taken ahead of the
filters and behind the filters in a system
quickly indicate on the dust recorder how
much—the filters are removing from the
circulating air.
One early finding with the new
equipment is something long suspected
by engineers—and some housewives. This
is that sometimes the dust level tends to
rise in the area of a clean-up effort and
may then subside to the same rather than
to a lower level.
Hot Safe
What is probably the world's "hottest"
safe—and one which no burglar would
want to crack—has been devised by Gen-
eral Electric Company atomic experts
here for storing and studying radio-active
materials.
The safe is a 15-ton, cylindrical in-
stallation that operates much like a soft
drink dispensing machine. It suspends up
to 780 "hot" samples on large horizon-
tal discs mounted one above the other
inside a six-foot vertical cylinder. These
samples are test pieces of uranium which
have been subjected to chain reaction in
plutonium-producing reactors at the Han-
ford plant, operated by G. E. for the
Atomic Energy Commission.
The floor vault can store materials with
as much radioactivity as exists in eight
pounds of radium, more than the total
amount produced in North America, be-
fore World War II.
The top of the storage cylinder, lo-
cated at ground level, is a steel disc, 10
inches thick and eight feet in diameter.
It is located in the Hanford radiometal-
lurgy laboratory and was designed as a
vital, supporting tool for research into
nuclear bombardment effects on fission-
able fuel.
To insert or remove a sample, techni-
cians rotate the discs below the floor level
by remote control until desired specimens
are lined up under access holes in the
discs above. Samples needed can be insert-
ed or extracted without having to remove
any other sample in storage. This ar-
rangement minimizes the escape of radia-
tion.
To remove a sample, the technician on
duty lifts a plug from the cylinder top.
places a one-ton lead cask over the open-
ing and turns a wheel to line up the
wanted sample.
Once the sample has been properly po-
sitioned, a claw mechanism is lowered
through an opening in the heavy cask to
lift it into the cask. After that it can
be transported safely to the main labora-
tory for study.
Samples that are the "hottest" radio-
actively are stored on the lowest disc, six
feet below the laboratory floor. This puts
18 inches of steel between them and the
working area.
During insertion or removal of sam-
ples, a vacuum system sucks air from the
laboratory into the safe, through a filter
and out an exhaust stack to prevent loose
radioactive particles from escaping into
the laboratory.
GE Proposes New Reactor Design
Two General Electric Company atomic
experts have proposed an atomic reactor

plants in airplanes, locomotives and
ships.

How to get longer
roller and belt life
in a conveyor system
Engineers had to find a way to reduce costly friction
and wear on rollers and idlers in designing this big
conveyor system. It handles up to 3,300 tons of ore
per hour on each of two 54" belts traveling at more
than 500 feet per minute. Their solution: Mounting
the idlers on Timken" tapered roller bearings.
Result: reduced friction, less sliding and scuffing
between idlers and belts, longer roller and belt life.
o
True rolling motion,
high precision practically
eliminate friction -
All lines drawn coincident with the working surfaces
of the rollers and races of Timken bearings meet at
a common point on the bearing axis. This means
Timken bearings are designed by geometrical law
to have true rolling motion. And they're manufac-
tured with great accuracy to live up to their design.
Result: Timken bearings practically eliminate fric-
tion, give longer bearing life, keep conveyors roll-
ing smoothly.

The design more than halves the
weight per horsepower of conventional
atomic reactors and eliminates many
moving parts that are standard in such
equipment.
The liquid metal reactor design is the
work of Dr. E. A. Luebke, physicist, and
L. B. Vandenberg, engineer, of the
Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory in
Schenectady, N. Y., operated by G. E.
for the Atomic Energy Commission. Dr.
Luebke described the design at an en-
gineering forum at the University of Cal-
ifornia at Los Angeles.
Most of the weight and bulk of the
conventional reactor was removed in the
G-E design, Dr. Luebke said, by "nest-
ing" the reactor inside a cylindrical heat
exchanger.
This arrangement, he explained, elim-
inates the separate heat exchanger used
to convert water into steam to drive
turbine-generators. In so doing, he said,
it eliminates much piping, valves and
open space which must be shielded to
protect personnel from radiation.
He explained that the coolant, liquid
sodium, passing through this type of
reactor becomes radioactive, making it
necessary to shield the entire system, in-
cluding space between pipes and related
equipment.
In their design, Dr. Luebke and Van-
denberg have eliminated this extra space,
and have placed the heat exchanger
around the reactor where it helps to con-
fine radioactivity to the reactor.
The space saving and simplification of
the reactor are achieved in the G-E
design through use of electricity genera-
ted by temperature differences in the heat
exchanger. It is contemplated that this
unique source of power can be used di-
rectly to pump the liquid metal coolant.
In effect, the system provides its own
power for pumping without reducing any
of the energy eventually used to drive
the turbine generators.
Dr. Luebke explained the system in
this way:
"The pumping action is obtained by
generating an electric current in the heat
exchanger by means of the temperature
gradient normally existing between the
hot and cold tubes, creating the necessary
crossed magnetic field with iron poles
pieces, and thus producing sufficient force

on the liquid metal."
The magnetic field used to move the
liquid metal, Vandenberg explained earli-
er, is created from a large current that
is derived from a thermocouple effect in
the heat exchanger and flows between the
pole pieces of a cylindrical horseshoe-
magnet.
Dr. Luebke said this type of thermo-
electric generating facility would not be
practical for producing power on a large-
scale in a central power station, but is
sufficient for developing auxiliary pump
ing power.
He said that the heat exchanger has
strips of suitable thermoelectric element*
between hot and cold tubes so that large
amounts of current flow are created.
Copper and sodium in remaining space
between the tubes reduce thermal and
electrical resistance.
The sodium enters from the top of the
reactor and flows down through the heat
exchanger so it follows the direction of
natural convection from the reactor heat
source.
Pumping action on the liquid metal
is self-regulating, Dr. Luebke reported
"An increase in reactor power result-
ing in a rise in sodium temperature will
cause increased pumping action," the
G-E scientist reported. "An increase in
demand from the turbine increases the
temperature gradient on the thermoele-
ments and also causes increased pumping
action."
Further control of the liquid metal
movement can be gained by use of an
electrical resistance device somewhat sim-
ilar to removable reactor control rods.
Voltage amounts are so small in the
pumping system that a thin layer of
insulating material can effectively reduce
the amount of current moving through
the heat exchanger.
The scientists explained that the small
amounts of voltage involved have done
away with problems in insulating elec-
trical current needed in conventional re
actor coolant pumps.
Monkeys have such a good time be-
cause there are so many of them, and
there are so many of them because they
have such a good time.

star basketball player—he looks so un-
happy."
"It's because his father is always wnt-

compound contours of modern jet
aircraft. Known as the Iceguard,
this rubber "electric blanket" defies
biting rain, hail and ice.
By combining the Iceguard with the
new electromechanical ice detector
and Control System of PSC Applied
Research, Ltd., operation is fully
automatic. The pilot is completely
freed from icing worries. Another
tribute to the teamwork for which
Goodyear engineers have become
famous.
Significant developments like this
are "par for the course" at Goodyear.
Here, engineers are given the free-
dom of thought and expression they
need for the practical application of
their new ideas. This imaginative
approach, encouraged by Goodyear
Management and supervised by
many of industry's leading technical
men, has been an important factor
in establishing Goodyear as "the
greatest name in rubber."
Today's greater dependence upon
technology means that now, more
than ever, Goodyear offers a world
of opportunity to young engineers.

TOUR FUTURE-Chemistry and Koppers?
IN an age when most frontiers are
shrinking, there is one that is constant-
ly growing—the frontier of the chemist.
This frontier has been pushed slowly
back ever since the days of the pioneer
18th and 19th Century chemists. Their
theories, proved in laboratories, were
made useful by the mechanical genius
of engineers such as Heinrich Koppers,
designer of the modern chemical recov-
ery coke oven. These early scientists
laid the foundation for the diversified
chemical industry that has grown so
rapidly in the 20th Century.
And what are the results? An indus-
try that has helped mankind by devel-
oping entirely new and better products
for more pleasant living; an industry

A Campus-to-Career Case History
"One open door after another
"When I joined the telephone company," says
Walter D. Walker, B.E.E., University of Minnesota,
'51, "I felt I could go in any direction. And that's
the way it has been.
"For the first six months I was given on-the-job
training in the fundamentals of the telephone busi-
ness—how lines are put up and equipment installed.
Learning those fundamentals has paid off for me.
"Then I had the opportunity to go to the Bell
Laboratories in New Jersey. I worked on memory
crystals—ferro-electric crystals—for use in digital
computers. I learned how important research is
to the telephone business.
"After two years I came back to Minnesota, to
St. Cloud, to work in the District Plant Engineer's
Office. There I made field studies of proposed con-
struction projects and drew up plans to guide the
construction crews. This combination of inside
and outside work gave me invaluable experience.
"In July, 1955, I came to Minneapolis as an
Engineer in the Exchange Plant Extension Engi-
neer's Office. We do forecasting—not of the weather,
but of future service needs. Using estimates of
growth and economic studies, we make our plans
for the years ahead. We figure out where and when
new facilities will be needed to meet future growth.
"All this has been preparing me for a real future.
You see, the telephone company is expanding by
leaps and bounds. That's why it offers a young
man so many open doors."
Wally Walker's career is with Northwestern Bell Telephone
Company. Many interesting career opportunities exist in other
Bell Telephone Companies, Bell Telephone Laboratories, West-
ern Electric and Sandia Corporation. Your placement officer
has more information regarding Bell System companies.

The basic function of industrial engineering is to develop and control methods for reducing manufacturing
costs by effecting the best possible utilization of men, materials and equipment. The industrial engineer is
trained to use constructive thinking to plan good methods, layouts, factory budgets, and standard proce-
dures so as to minimize costs. He is likewise trained to be analytical in studying facts relating to manufactur-
ing problems and in determining improved courses of action.
The above photograph shows students using a 16 mm. moving picture film in one of the University's labor-
atories to analyze a factory job and determine ways of improving it. An extensive film library of industrial oper-
ations is available for this purpose. Other sections of this laboratory are used in determining output standards
by means of time study and the times for basic motions. Modern machine tool and gage laboratories are avail-
able to aid in studying the development and control of such processes as machining, welding, forging, cast-
ing, die-casting, rolling and stamping.
The Industrial Engineering curriculum includes the same basic technical background developed by all
curriculums in the College of Engineering. In addition, specialized training is offered in one of two options,
or branches of this curriculum, the Management Option "A" or the Production Option "B". Courses in the
Management Option deal with production control statistical quality control, wage incentives, engineering
economy, materials handling, plant layout and industrial relations. The Production Option offers some of
these courses and others concerned more specifically with the development of manufacturing processes. Study
can be made leading to the Bachelor of Science, Master's, and Doctor's Degrees.

A WHIRLPOOL SPIRALS into the inlet of a model pump. This unique picture shows
how air, a common cause of pumping trouble, was carried into the pump in .. •
The Case of the Baffled Whirlpool
Some time ago, the report reached us that two
Worthington vertical turbine pumps installed by one
of our customers weren't working right. They deliv-
ered plenty of water, but vibrated badly and burned
out bearings.
The customer asked us to find the trouble fast.
After checking we knew the pumps were okay, so
Worthington Research had to answer him.
First thing we did was build a one-tenth scale
model of the customer's installation. The photo
shows what happened when we started pumping.
A whirlpool immediately formed between the water
surface and the pump inlet. Air, trapped in the whirl-
pool and carried into the pump, was the villain in
the case.
The solution came with experimentation. A simple
baffle arrangement in a side channel eliminated the
whirlpool—and the trouble-making air.
Chasing the gremlins from pump installations like
this, boosting the efficiency of heat transfer in air
conditioners, developing better seals for pumps and
compressors — these are all in the day's work for
Worthington's busy research engineers. At Worth-
ington, research ranks right alongside engineering,
production, and sales to develop better products for
all industry.

To create in steel the flowing lines of today's cars, calls for metal of particular forming qualities.
Sleek styling starts with special steel:
Photography turns cuemist—ne/psproduce it.
Fenders, hoods, roofs and side panels
call for best quality steel—and the
watchful eye of photography guards
specifications and controls that quality.
Car designers' dreams come true only if steel forms
well under the pressure of deep drawing opera-
tions. That takes a particularly high quality steel.
Great Lakes Steel Corporation, Detroit, Mich.,
unit of National Steel Corporation, makes this
steel for the automobile industry. And to make
sure of its high quality they use photography.
For example, during production, spectrograms
show chemical make-up—insure the proper minute
quantities of alloying elements, and photomicro-
graphs reveal crystalline structure.
Controlling quality is but one of the many ways
photography works for modern industry. In small
businesses and large it is aiding product design,
simplifying production, creating sales and expe-
diting office routine.
At Great Lakes Steel a spectrogram is readied for reading in
the densitometer —one of the tests that assure quality steel.
Behind the many photographic products be-
coming increasingly valuable today and those
being planned for tomorrow lie intriguing and
challenging opportunities at Kodak in research,
design and production.
If you are interested in these opportunities in
science and engineering—whether you are a recent
graduate or a qualified returning serviceman, write
