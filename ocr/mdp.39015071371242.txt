MEMORIAL TO CHARLES EZRA GREENE.
On the Wednesday of commencement week, June 21, 1905, at three
o'clock, the students and faculty of the Engineering Department, members
of the Board of Regents, and other friends of the late dean gathered in
the court yard of the new engineering building for the purpose of un-
veiling the bronze tablet, recently placed in one of the panels of the
arched hallway of this building in memory of Professor Charles E. Greene.
The tablet bears the following inscription:
In Memory of
CHARLES EZRA GREENE, A. M., C. E.,
PROFESSOR OF CIVII. ENGINEERING
IN THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
FROM 1872 TO 1903,
First Dean of the
Department of Engineering
from 1895 to 1903,
Who was born at Cambridge,
Massachusetts, on the second
day of December, 1842, and died
at Ann Arbor, Michigan, on the
Sixteenth day of October, 1903.
This Tablet is erected by the
Students and Faculty of the
Department of Engineering of
the University of Michigan as an
Expression of Lasting Esteem
and Affectionate Regard for
their Teacher and Colleague.


After a song, by the students of the Engineering Department, the
Associate Dean, Professor J. B. Davis, introduced the speaker, Charles
Carroll Brown, C. E., of the class of 1879, as "one of our older graduates,
who has verified in his own life the value of the instruction and influence
of Professor Greene."
Mr. Brown's address was as follows:
"We meet today to pay our tribute to the character and achievements
of one whom we all delight to honor, one who always did his best, one who
brought out of his students the best that was in them. Perhaps the most
fitting remembrance of him will be a study of the effect which his influence
and his instruction has had upon those who came to him for training
in the newest and greatest of professions. In the nature of the case, the
results of this study cannot be expressed in definite terms of achievement
by any one or more of those who have been led to better things by the
quiet but persistent influence of our common source of inspiration, but
their nature and their evident tendencies may be stated with some accuracy.
Their effect upon indivduals must be noted and estimated in the light of
our own knowledge and acceptance of them.
Our great profession is so new, that it has not yet found its true
place in the world's economy, although it has made rapid strides within
a generation, largely on account of the influence of such as our departed
friend and instructor. It is still a mystery, to many well informed men
and women, who can see the place in the economy of life of the profes-
sions which have for their subject of study the relations of man to his
creator, to his fellow-men. and to hif own body, but who do not realize
the importance of the profession which has to do with the fitting of his
environments for his greater convenience and comfort. This may be be-
cause engineering began very early in operations which all understood, in
making of tools, in building of houses, in construction of boats, in building
of bridges, all now very simple problems on the scale of operations possible
for many centuries. "Familiarity breeds contempt," and these early engin-
eering feats have not been sufficiently differentiated from the great achieve-
ments of the century which has elapsed since engineering first claimed the
right to a position among the learned professions.
We began some hundreds of years ago to think that we can take care
of our own relations with our Maker better than to delegate them to an-
other, so that the ministry is now really a branch of the teaching pro-
fession, so far as most of us arc concerned. Litigation has reduced in
volume so rapidly in late years that the ranks of another profession are
being decimated. As we learn to know our true selves we are learning,
as yet slowly, but with increasing rapidity, that our bodies are but outward
expressions of the inner conditions, and that the roots of disease must be
reached by other means than the treatment of the external symptoms.


There are indications therefore of an ultimate displacement of still another
profession, at least in part, by that of teaching.
There are then actually but two great professions which are upon an
enduring basis, which do not rest on the disagreements of man with his
body, or his neighbor, or his God,—those of teaching and of engineering.
Those of us who graduated in the early days of Professor Greene's
connection with the University have seen great changes in all the profes-
sions, and wc are amazed at the enormous strides which these two profes-
sions have made as the snowball has gathered size and momentum. We
expect to see the day when they will receive the recognition which their
true worth deserves.
What has our beloved friend and preceptor done towards this great
advancement, and what has he done to give it stability, the solid founda-
tion which it must have to sustain so vast a structure ? ■
Let us apply the inquiry first to the matter of professional spirit. The
fundamental basis of any profession is honesty. Can any one imagine any-
thing but the most transparent honesty in any word or action of Professor
Greene? More than any other characteristic this has impressed itself
upon his pupils, and it has had its influence throughout their careers.
It was sometimes inconveniently uncompromising with some of the
thoughtless infractions of right dealing during the college life of some of
us, and by this very inflexibility it made the deeper impression upon us.
We always expect, when we meet a graduate of this engineering school,
to find a reflection of this spirit and are seldom disappointed.
Perhaps one of the reasons for the tardy recognition of the place of
engineering in the professions may be found in the intimate mingling
of professional and business problems in most of the work of the successful
engineer. It is often very hard to separate the purely business features of
a proposition from those which are actually professional, though having a
tinge of finance and politics. The classic definition of the engineer is "he
who directs and applies the great forces of nature for the use and bene-
fit of man." If we restrict ourselves to this definition we confine ourselves
to what we all term the strictly professional. This definition very nearly
fits Professor Greene, for nearly all his work is covered by it, and we
gained our professional instincts from observation of his firm position
upon this foundation. Many of us even decry the business side of our
engagements, because of the restriction of our view to what we term the
strictly scientific aspects of engineering and its problems.
But modern engineering cannot be covered without an addition to
this definition or an explanation of it which amounts to. the same thing,
and we find this additional qualification of the engineer exemplified in
Professor Greene, though many of us may have overlooked it, at least for
a time. When we speak of the great forces of nature we have an over-


whelming sense of abundance, of disregard of waste which is likely to
lead us to a similar disregard of a principle which underlies all well-
directed human effort, that of economy. The strictly scientific man works
for his end without reference to the economic value of his work
or of the result The strictly scientific engineer has the same
tendencies. But the fact is, that the human element in the
carrying out of a project involving the solution of engineering problems
cannot be ignored. It is one of the great forces of nature, and it must
be guided and directed as the other forces are guided and directed. Any
engineer can build a railroad who is supplied with all the men, materials,
and time that he asks for, but it takes a great engineer to build a railroad
that will be successful in meeting the demands made upon it by the human
element as well as in overcoming the physical obstacles. It seems to me,
therefore, that the consideration of economy of time, money, material,
labor or what not, which adds the great human factor to the other powers
of nature to be guided and directed, belongs beyond question to the en-
gineer, and that the acquiring of the ability to solve this class of problems
is as truly a part of his engineering education as that of overcoming the
physical difficulties. Some of us did not find it out until we had obtained
the broader view which comes from variety of experience, but Professor
Greene was an economist of high order. He put time to its utmost use.
I do not know of a school in which a more thorough training could be ob-
tained in the same time and with the same number of instructors. This
is due to his ability to put every moment to use, to put his problems and
his hints for their solution in the fewest possible words and in the right
order to save duplication of the student's effort in carrying them through.
This results in the saving of space, in his books, for example. His re-
markable command of language aids him in stating his propositions with
perfect clearness in the fewest possible words, and repitition is therefore
not necessary. He treats the subject of graphics in but a fraction of the
space which is required by other writers. His devotion to economy of
time and effort led him to the invention of graphical and algebraic
methods of solution of problems which have been invaluable. The meth-
od of area-moments, for example, which was original with him, makes
possible the application of methods of solution of a large class of prob-
lems otherwise very difficult or at least tedious to carry through. Neither
docs he restrict himself to the graphical method, as a scientist interested
only in the problem and the method of solution immediately before him
would probably do, but when the methods of algebra or the calculus better
answer his purpose, or when weights are better than measures, he uses
them, with economy of time and labor. A very good example of his
economy of money may be found in his design of the trestle across the
Huron River on the Toledo, Ann Arbor &amp; Northern Railroad, which


was quite noted in its day. It is quite possible that no one would again
use this design exactly, but, for its own place and the conditions of the
case, it would have been very difficult to design a structure which would
be better suited to its work, and at the same time better fitted to the
funds available for the construction of the road. Professor Greene was
not silent upon this subject of economy, but, so far as I was concerned
at least, it was overshadowed by his devotion to the scientific nature of
the problems in the class room, and I did not recognize the value of his
quiet advice until I had found by actual experience, that the young engineer
who would succeed must please his clients, not alone by the excellence of
his work but also by its economy. The successul engineer of these
modern days is the one who best guides and directs the forces of nature to
the desired end with the least expense of time, money, and labor.
We hear much about commercialism these days. Commercialism in
art, commercialism in literature, commercialism in medicine and law, com-
mercialism even in science. I have been searching for a definition which
would express what is meant by the term, and it has not been an easy
task.- If the word is to express a single idea or group of ideas it will be
necessary to restrict its meaning to the prostitution of an art, a profession,
or a science to the making of money, without reference to the honesty of
the process. It is very nearly a synonym for graft, as that bit of slang
is applied in politics and in business. Commercialism in this sense is fatal
to true development. It brings its own retribution. The conditions in
the engineering profession have been such, and the honesty of its prac-
titioners has been so great, that there is seldom any attempt to apply the
term "commercialism" in this objectionable sense to an engineer. There
are a few instances in which it could be properly so applied, but most of
these have been to imitation engineers, who only bring discredit upon
the profession among men who do not know that they are not of it.
But there is a sense in which commercial can be properly applied to
the occupation of an engineer. Nearly all his problems have their com-
mercial side, and it may often be the most important one. We must there-
fore clearly make the distinction between the ideas expressed by the words
commercialism and commercial, as just used. The former we shun in-
stinctively, in part, by reason of our college training and example. The
latter we must take into account more completely if we would attain the
utmost success. It is not money but the love of money which is the root
of evil. Money itself is simply a symbol of power, and it must be as-
sumed as such by the engineer and given its full value by him. He has
Professor Greene's example if not his precept as a guide in this, as in
other good things. A touchstone will be found in the answer to the ques-
tion, "Am I trying to turn this into money for myself without considera-
tion of the interests of my clients, and of the work, or am I simply treat-


ing economy as one of the factors in the practical solution of a scientific
problem?"
The influence of Professor Greene's methods of instruction upon his
students is shown with marked effect in their ability to do original think-
ing. They do not simply follow the lines which he laid down for them,
but they take the principles which he stated, and apply them according to
their own ideas of the manner in which their problems should be worked
out. This is so pronounced that it is frequently given as a characteristic
of Michigan engineering graduates. It shows that he possessed the spirit
of the true instructor, teaching his students not facts, but how to use facts.
Another way in which his influence has been felt is in the recognition
by his students of the value of the proper presentation of a subject. His
own lucid and condensed statement of a problem and of its method of
solution is in itself an inspiration to try to secure the same success. One
of the serious lacks in the engineer's education of the past was a train-
ing in the proper use of the English language. Most of the older engin-
eers who have the ability to express themselves with force and elegance
learned the art elsewhere than in an engineering school. Fortunately this
need has been recognized by some of our engineering schools, and there
is now a great improvement in their courses of study in this regard.
But the time allotted to these exercises prevents a further enumera-
tion of the influences, great and small, exerted by him whom they are in-
tended to honor, and I must close. I cannot do this better than in the
words of one of his colleagues at a previous memorial service:
"The great works shall pass away. Even so enduring monuments
as the pyramids arc passing away. The wonderful works of the great
engineers of the world may crumble and decay. They shall at least
pass to their destiny, come to their end, no matter how enduring they
may now seem to be. No one, however, can say that the work of such
a man as this devoted teacher has an end. Into the lives of those he has
taught have been built motives, influences, in a word, character, that will
go on in power beyond the vision of any human being. Such men never
die. Their names may be lost or forgotten. Their words may disappear
from our speech or language. But the men they have helped to make shall
go on doing their part in the making of other men, and reach through these
channels to distant generations. The truth made plain by such a man
adds to the world's heritage, and shall go on with its message of benefits
to the race, far beyond the limits of our power to estimate. As the faith-
ful engineer builds his deep laid foundations as securely as men can build,
so has this man built, not in steel nor stones, but in human lives. He has
built those unseen things that are eternal."
In presenting the tablet to the Board of Regents, Professor M. E.
Cooley, Dean of the Engineering Department, laid stress on the fact that


this memorial to the late dean is mainly due to the initiative of the stu-
dents of the department. At a mass-meeting in the fall of 1903, it was
resolved to appoint a committee to cooperate with the faculty in devising
an appropriate memorial to Professor Greene. The president of the then
senior class, Mr. John H. Mustard, appointed on this committee one stu-
dent from each of the four classes, viz.: Messrs. Morris H. Stimson, Henry
C. Dewey, George L. Harmon, and Martin H. Daane. These gentlemen,
after consulting with a committee of the faculty, decided that the me-
morial should take the form of a bronze tablet to be placed in the new
engineering building. The subscriptions were confined to students and
faculty members of the department at the time of Professor Greene's
death. The joint committee of students and faculty conferred with Mr.
Albert Kahn, the architect of the new engineering building, who at once
volunteered his services and expressed his pleasure at having the oppor-
tunity to show his appreciation of what had been done for his brothers
who had been students under Professor Greene in the University.
President Angell, in accepting the tablet in behalf of the Board of
Regents, paid a final tribute of appreciation and respect to the character
of Professor Greene. "Two salient traits of a good engineer character-
ized him in a marked degree, namely, sincerity and integrity. His great
merit was that he left the impress of these traits on the long procession
of students who came under his care."
Singing by the students closed the simple exercises of this memorial
service. A. Z.


JOHN R. ALLEN, M. E.
By Professor Herbert C. Sadler.
Professor John Robins Allen was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in
1869. His parentage permits him to claim the privilege of being a true
Yankee, his father, Dr. James M. Allen, being a Massachusetts man and
a graduate of Harvard and his mother a Vermont lady.
His early life was spent in Milwaukee where he obtained his early
education in the public schools. After spending three years at the High
School of his native town, he realized that his tastes lay in the direction
of engineering. Under these circumstances he decided that the University
of Michigan was the place for him to go. He therefore came to Ann
Arbor and finished his high school course, graduating in 1888. The fall
of the same year he entered the University and took the Mechanical
Engineering Course. At that time the engineering courses were part of
the Literary department, the present Engineering department as a sep-
arate faculty dating from the year 1895. During his University course
Professor Allen took advantage of the summer holidays to gain some
practical knowledge of engineering, the time being spent in the foundry
of the Filer-Stowel Corliss Engine Company. One summer, however, he
took a holiday, but even then his constructive mind would not let him
rest, for practically unaided he built himself a cottage in the north of
Michigan. He graduated from Michigan University with the degree of
B. S. in Mechanical Engineering in 1892, and shortly after graduation
he entered the employment of the Bay City Industrial Works, as erector.
While with this company, he had charge of the erection and installation
of several large cranes, notably those at the Grant Locomotive Works,
Boundbrook Engine Works, N. J., and the Syracuse Steel Co. When
not employed in erecting he spent the time in the drafting and designing
department, so gaining valuable experience in this 4ine of work.
In the summer of 1893, he entered the services of L. K. Cumstock
and again had charge of the erection of various engineering plants.
Towards the fall of the same year the firm was made into a company
and Mr. Allen was appointed its engineer and secretary. In this capacity
he had charge of installing numerous electrical power plants, steam plants,
and general electrical construction, among which were the New York
Life Building and the Columbus Memorial Building of Chicago.
The following year in October he married Lola H. Conrad, who was
herself a graduate of the University of Michigan of the class of '93 (B. S.
Literary department).


In the fall of 1894 he resigned from the Cumstock Company and
started in business for himself in partnership with W. D. Ball. Here
again he increased his already varied experience, acting as consulting
and constructing engineer for numerous steam and electrical power
installations.
In the fall of 1895, in accordance with a previous arrangement between
himself and his partner, he entered the University for a post-graduate
course. It needed some courage to break away from practical work, but
the benefits that would accrue from a further study of engineering along
systematic and scientific lines, were in his opinion, too strong to combat.
He succeeded in obtaining the degree of Mechanical Engineer (M. E.) in
the following spring.
About this time the state of trade all over the country was in a very
bad condition. It was on this account and also owing to the resignation
of Professor Wagner that, when offered the position of Instructor in
Mechanical Engineering at the University, he decided to take up this
branch of the profession. The combination of circumstances has since
proved fortunate both for the University and the Student. The large
and varied practical experience at his command, coupled with a thorough
scientific training, has rendered his work in teaching both strong and
effective.
After three years as instructor, he was raised to an assistant pro-
fessorship. Shortly after this in th espring of 1899 he was unfortunately
seized with a severe illness which compelled his applying for leave of
absence from the University. Although at one time things looked dark,
kind fate decreed that he was too good a man to go and that there was
still work for him to do. The soft air of Florida together with rest and
quiet restored him to his usual good health, which since then he has
continued to enjoy.
In 1902 he was promoted to the work of Junior Professor of Mech-
anical Engineering. During his connection with the University he has
had the inestimable advantage of being associated with Professor Cooley
in many of his investigations and other works of an engineering nature.
Amongst these may be mentioned the design and installation of the heat-
ing system in the Newberry Asylum, and the testing of numerous plants,
notably that of the Grand Rapids pumping station, perhaps the most com-
plete investigation ever made in this particular line.
One of Professor Allen's largest "jobs" has been the erection and
installation of the Waterworks, Sewerage and Lighting Systems for
Mackinaw Island. In this connection he was resident engineer and had
complete charge of and engaged all the labor used in the work, even
including the housing and feeding of the men employed, this in itself
being no small job.


As a result of the success of this undertaking he was appointed as
consulting engineer to the city of St. Ignace when they decided to install
a central electric-lighting station.
He is at present associated with William Brush, of Detroit, as con-
sulting engineer, and has recently been connected with the remodeling
of the St. Clair Waterworks, and other designs of an engineering nature.
He is a member of a number of Engineering societies including the
Institute of Mechanical Engineers, honorary associate of the Stationary
Engineers, Detroit Engineering Society, etc. He also takes a great interest
in student life, being on the board of governors of the Union and a mem-
ber of Michigamua. He also belongs to the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity
and is a member of the Sigma Xi.
Professor Allen is in many respects a typical professor of the modern
engineering school; a man of wide experience in his profession and one
who can "point a moral and adorn a tale" to many a text book investiga-
tion. A hard and untiring worker for the greater part of the year, he
is never so happy as when he snatches a few days rest in the summer, fish-
ing and boating amongst The Snows of Northern Michigan. With such a
personality it is not surprising that John Allen has endeared himself
alike to both faculty and students. i


-NEW FOUNDRY, ENGINEERING SHOPS J2 X 120—ICJO5.


ROBERT ALEXANDER WINSLOW.
By Dean Mortimer E. Cooley.
One of tlie first men with whom the writer became acquainted on
his arrival in Ann Arbor in the summer of 1881 was Robert A. Winslow,
the moulder at the old Ann Arbor Foundry near the Ann Arbor Railroad
crossing on West Huron street. The personality of the man was such
that one very soon became attached to him, and many were the pleasant
and profitable hours spent by his side while he riddled the sand, tamped
the flask, and slicked with a gentle and skillful touch the walls of the
mould before its final closing and clamping ready for the pouring. And
what a delight it was to watch him when the heat was taken off. It was
never any common everyday affair with him, far from it. It never grew
old or became monotonous. There was always the same restless activity,
the same anxiety, the same pride in having things go off well. Every
helper became imbued with his spirit and stepped as lively as the master
himself, and there was always a particular piquancy and flavor in the
atmosphere when his sharp, crisp orders were given with a "hot-short-
ness" suggesting the presence of sulphur in the molten iron being poured.
Nor did one have to know him long as Mr. Winslow, and even Robert
did not fit the man very well, but "Bob," better still "Old Bob," was the
name most loved of all. It was a fitting tribute to the man that old
graduates, when gathered together at the banquet table, always included
in their remarks some loving remembrance of "Old Bob."
Not only was he a master workman at his trade, he was also a good
teacher. His students never failed to appreciate and admire his skill,
and always gave full and attentive consideration to his words of instruc-
tion, were they delivered over the mould, or in the little corner room
separated from the main sand floor only by a low partition. Nor did he
lack in discipline if one may judge from a story related with much glee
by one of his old boys, to the effect that one day when Bob was lecturing
to his class in the little corner room and stepped outside for a model
to illustrate some point he was explaining, the door was closed and
locked on the inside. Not a sound was heard from anyone—just a hold-
ing of breath waiting to hear what Bob might say. But he said nothing,
not a word—simply picked up the hose hanging on the wall, turned on
the water and played over the partition. There was a wild scramble, the
door opened, and the class rushed out with a yell. Bob walked in, took
bis seat, and the class filed back with a grin, and the lecture went on


as if there had been no interruption. Was it any wonder that "Bob"
should have been near to the boys' hearts?
Mr. Winslow was of a type of moulder now rarely met. His long
and varied experience in the foundry of the early day had given him
a peculiar skill. He was not dependent on machinery, or special tools,
and even the pattern itself was not always a necessity with him. He
could accomplish much with very little. It was no unusual thing for him
to use the broken casting itself as a pattern to secure the new part
needed in making quick repairs. He could carve from the sand, without
any pattern, moulds for many things, and he greatly delighted in an
opportunity to turn out a graceful andiron for a fireplace, an ornamental
seat or an urn for a lawn, or a panel decorated with a head, or afn
animal as its chief feature.
For one who had not had the advantages of a training in metallurgy,
Mr. Winslow was remarkably well informed on the principal character-
istics of the metals used in the machinery art. He was a careful reader,
and many the time is recalled when he came at a noon hour to submit
some problem he had studied over, to learn if he had solved it correctly.
Better than all, perhaps, he was a good citizen, loved and respected
by his neighbor, his influence on his fellowmen being always for the best
Mr. Winslow began his work in the University in February, 1882,
giving only a part of his time to the University until 1887, at which time
the work had increased to such an extent as to require all his time. He
was still in the employ of the University, its oldest Shop instructor, vig-
orous both physically and mentally, up to the time of his death.
Mr. Winslow was thoroughly in love with his work and had made
many plans for its development when the improvements resulting from
the enlargement of the Foundry should be finally completed. When he
came to the University the Engineering Shops were comprised in a single
building 24x36 feet, two stories in height. This building was built in the
winter of 1881-82, being made ready for occupancy at the opening of the
second semester. The foundry occupied one-half of the ground floor,
18x24 feet in area, the little cupola being sixteen inches in diameter and
five feet high, placed on the east side of the chimney in the center of the
building. The balance of the first floor was devoted to the forge shop
and engine room. One half of the second floor was a pattern shop, the
other half a machine shop. This old building was originally a frame
structure sheathed inside and out with brick. It has since been converted
into a residence and now stands on the southwest corner of Volland and
Observatory streets.
Mr. Winslow had for twenty-three years been identified with the
development of the Engineering Shops, and had watched over the growth
of his own department from the time of its almost toy-like beginning with


only half a dozen students up to within less than a week of his death, at
which time the foundry had grown to occupy the entire west wing of the
shops, 33x120 feet. His last class numbered one hundred and nine students.
Robert Alexander Winslow was born in Poughkeepsie, New York,
January 20, 1832. While still quite young his parents came to Michigan
and settled on a farm near Brighton. He came to Ann Arbor about 1845
and after attending school for a time was apprenticed to Mr. Charles
Tripp and Robert Price to learn the moulder's trade. Tripp &amp; Price
were the proprietors of what was then known as the "City Foundry."
Mr. Winslow was married August 23, 1854, to Miss Addie C. Coates, of
Ypsilanti, then a mere village. Later he moved to Seneca Falls, New
York, where he worked in the Gould Pump Works for five years, and
then came back to Ann Arbor. In a short time he moved his family out
to Iowa and took charge of a foundry, and in 1880 came back again to
Michigan and located in Saline. He worked at the confectioner's trade
in Ypsilanti for about six years, achieving considerable reputation in
that business.
His wife died in September, 1895. They had three children, a son,
Charles, and two daughters, Jessie (Mrs. Kuss) and Viola (Mrs. Butler);
the latter died several years ago. He was married a second time, Sep-
tember 13, 1897, to Mrs. Emogene Bangs Bennett, who survives him. He
died, after a very short illness, July 21, 1905, at the age of 73 years and
6 months.


UNIFORM LOADS FOR TEST BEAMS.
By C J. Tilden, Assoc. M. Am. Soc C. E.
One of the serious difficulties encountered by the engineer who has
to make tests of large beams is to secure a uniformly distributed load
which shall really act as such. The arching effect of pig-iron, brick or
sand-bags, piled indiscriminately on the beam, destroys entirely the scien-
tific accuracy of such experiments, and often enables results to be obtained
which are wholly misleading. An attempt to solve this problem in a
test of a large beam at the University of Michigan last summer (1905)
was so far successful that it is believed a description of the methods em-
ployed will be of interest to engineers and others who may have work
of this kind to do.
The beam was of reinforced concrete, 27'—o" long over all, with a
total depth of 20 inches. The section was a "double T," that is, in reality
two beams, each 16 inches deep, 12 inches wide at the top and g'A inches
at the bottom, carrying a slab 4 inches deep and 5'—o" wide. The two
beams and the slab were, however, one monolithic mass, as shown in the
accompanying drawings and photographs. At the ends the beam was
supported on 10H" x 12" timbers, about seven feet long, each built up of
six 2" x 12" planks. These timber supports were set on stone slabs, 3
inches thick which, in turn, rested on the ground. The clear span was a
little over 25'—o", and the distance, center to center of supports, 26'—\Yi".
In beginning the loading, a weighed quantity of sand, (2,000 lbs.) was
spread evenly over the top of the beam to a depth of about 2 inches. The
center to center span of 26'—\l/i" was then divided into twenty-five equal
parts, (1.045 feet or about 12^ inches each) and at each point of division
an iron tube was set transversely on top of the slab, at right angles to the
axis of the beam and projecting equally on either side. These tubes,
which were about 4 inches diameter and 13'—7" long, were obtained from
the University scrap-heap, having been "scrapped" from the heating plant
some months before. The layer of sand which was first spread over the
beam served the double purpose of distributing the load from the tube
uniformly across the slab and of holding the tube in place while the load
of sand-bags was being placed.
The method of loading is indicated in the accompanying photographs.
The beam was divided into 13 panels, or bays, which were lettered from
A at the east end to M at the west end, each bay being the space covered
by a pair of tubes. Across each pair of tubes sand-bags, weighing ap-

proximately 100 lbs. each, were laid as shown, care being taken in build-
ing up the piles of sacks in each bay to keep a clear space betweeH the
adjacent piles. In this manner the load from each pile of sand bags was

evenly divided between the two tubes which supported it, and the narrow
open space between contiguous piles not only maintained this even division
of the load as the beam deflected, but prevented any of the direct effect
of the load being lost on account of "arching." Even when the deflection


of the beam was enough to bring two adjacent piles into contact, the ends
of the bags were sufficiently yielding so that no appreciable lateral sup-
port resulted. In fact, the sand-bags proved to be ideally suited to this
method of loading.
The loaded sacks were set in place by a gang of eight men working
in pairs, two pairs on each side of the beam. The bags had all been pre-
viously weighed, and the weight of each bag marked on it with chalk.
Beginning at one end of the beam, the two men on the north side would
place a bag on the pair of tubes at A and call out to the recorder its
weight as "102 lbs. on A." The pair on the south side immediately placed
their bag, also in the bay A, and called out its weight They were fol-
lowed at once by the two pairs of men at the other end of the beam, who
placed their sand-bags on either side at M, and called out the weights as
before. Next, the loads were added in the bays B and L, then in C and K,
and so on till G was reached at the middle of the beam. The loading was
accomplished, therefore, in increments of about 2,600 lbs. each and in
general the deflection was read after each increment of load. The tally-
sheet was so arranged that the weight of each sand-bag was recorded as
it went in place. As the piles of sand-bags increased in height, it be-
came necessary to have two additional men on top of the load to receive
the bags from the men on the ground, and put them in their proper places.
The time occupied in placing one increment of load (2,600 lbs.) and taking
the deflection reading, averaged about 5 minutes.
The total load on the beam was made up, therefore, of three dis-
tinct parts:
(1.) The weight of the beam, estimated to be 15,000 pounds. (Com-
puted from actual weights of several 6"x6"x6" cubes of concrete made
at the time of making the beam.)
(2.) The sand, 2,000 pounds, which was spread evenly over the slab,
and in which the tubes were bedded.
(3.) The tubes and sand-bags, all of which were weighed and re-
corded.
Of this total, 17,000 pounds, (the beam itself and layer of sand)
was uniformly distributed, while the weights of the tubes and their loads
were concentrated at equal intervals as above described.
The loading commenced about noon of September 1, and at 5:20 p.
m. had reached a total of 75,000 pounds (74,995), or 60,000 pounds super-
imposed load. At that time work was discontinued on account of dark-
ness. About the same time, also, a slight drizzle began, which soon set-


tied into a quiet rain which lasted much of the night. As soon as the
rain began an attempt was made to protect the load already on the beam,
but the means at hand were entirely inadequate, and it was possible to
cover only a part of the load. Before resuming the experiment next day,
the sacks which had been exposed to the rain were counted, a dozen of
them, chosen at random, taken off, reweighed, and the increase noted,
from which the total increase in weight due to rain was calculated to
be very nearly 500 pounds. This was subsequently checked by a compu-
tation based on the record of rainfall furnished by the University Obser-
vatory, and the area of load exposed.
The maximum load was 91,250 pounds total, including weight of beam.
Failure occurred 13 minutes after the last sack had been placed. The
photograph was taken just before the beam failed.
The accompanying drawings have been prepared to show the remark-
ably close agreement between actual values of bending moments and
shears obtainable by this method of loading and the corresponding theo-
retical values for a uniformly distributed load. The full-line semi-para-
bola shows the theoretical variation of bending moments on the left hand
side of the beam if the total load on the beam had been uniformly dis-
tributed, the maximum moment at the center, on this assumption, being
298,000 ft. lbs. The dotted semi-parabola is similarly drawn for that part
of the total load, considered as uniformly distributed, lying between the
two abutments,—i. e., neglecting the two concentrations of 3,515 pounds
each which are carried directly by the supports and so do not affect the
shears or bending moments; the maximum from this is 275,000 ft. lbs.
at the center. The intermediate dash-line curve, made up of straight
line segments, shows the actual variation of bending moments in the
beam, the moment at each point of concentration (tube) having been
computed and laid off to scale. Although 17,000 pounds of the tetal
load was actually uniformly distributed, the entire load was assumed to
be concentrated at the tubes in making these calculations; the resulting
error would be practically negligible, as the more accurate computation
would simply cause a very slight curvature in each segment of the poly-
gon, not appreciable in the drawing. The actual maximum moment oc-
curred under the tubes on either side of the center, and was 286,000 ft.
lbs. (285,990.) A study of these diagrams indicates that a slight rearrange-
ment of the points of concentration,—putting, for example, the end loads
a half panel-length from the supports instead of having them directly over
the abutment centers,—might bring the moment polygon for actual loads
into virtual coincidence with the parabola.


The curve of shears is similarly drawn, the full-line showing the
theoretical variation for a uniformly distributed load and the dash-line
the actual variation. In curve I, the entire load is considered concentrated
at the tubes; in curve II, the 17,000 pounds distributed load is considered
as such, and the remaining 74,250 pounds concentrated at the tubes as
it actually was in the test.


MANUFACTURE OF HYDRAULIC CEMENTS.*
By L. L. Stone, '08.
In preparing a paper on the subject of cement it is fully recognized
that many articles have already been prepared on this subject, and that
various descriptions of it have repeatedly been written. Yet, the exten-
sive developments in the cement industry, both from an engineering and
financial standpoint, are commanding such' unusual attention that the man-
ufacture of cement is very much discussed. It is then the purpose of this
paper to give here as complete a description of the processes of manu-
facture as possible, free from the cumbersome figures which may be ob-
tained at length from any factory report.
The term Hydraulic Cement is applied to any cement which possesses
the property of hardening under water. Under these cements are in-
cluded the three chief commercial cements of the present time, viz.:
Natural, Slag and Portland Cements. The general process of manufac-
turing and hardening is similar in the three classes. Each is a compound
consisting chiefly of lime, silica and alumina, calcined- at a high tempera-
ture and the product reduced to a fine powder. The compounds of lime,
silica and alumina are produced by thoroughly mixing some form of car-
bonate of lime with the exact proportion of clay.
Natural cement was the first cement manufactured in this country,
and was extensively used some years ago when nearly all Portland ce-
ment was imported from Europe. It is still used to a small extent but
only for work of secondary importance. It is made in several places
throughout the country from natural deposits of rock containing nearly
the same proportions of lime rock and clay as are used to produce Port-
land cement. If a uniform deposit of rock containing exactly the correct
proportions of rock and shale could be found, a natural cement, equal
in grade to Portland cement, could be made of it, by simply burning and
grinding; but since a variation of a very few per cent in composition is
sufficient to destroy or greatly reduce the value of the resulting cement,
there never has been found a natural rock deposit sufficiently uniform to
produce a cement of this quality. In many cases it is only by the most

Engineering Co., at Independence, Kans., but will return to college next
semester.


careful sorting and mixing of certain portions of the raw material that
cement can be made from it at all. The process of manufacture is very
simple, the rock is quarried and burned at a comparatively low temper-
ature and ground to a powder. It is slower in setting than Portland
cement and does not develop as great strength.
Slag cement is made by mixing blast furnace slag with some form
of lime, then burning and grinding. It can also be made from the forms
of rock discharged from volcanoes and it is thought that this is the source
of the cement used by the Romans in their engineering work. Its manu-
facture was introduced into this country more to provide a way of dis-
posing of the vast amount of slag accumulating at the larger blast fur-
naces than for its demand as a cement The slag as it comes from the
furnaces is generally granulated by contact with cold water. It is then
mixed with slacked lime and heated and the resulting mass finely ground.
A description of the machinery employed in these processes has not been
given for it is simitar to that used in the manufacture of Portland cement
which will be described more in detail.
Portland cement was first made in England about the year 1825. It
derives the name "Portland" from Portland Island Rock, from which
cement was first made. While the essential features of the process of
manufacturing were there discovered, cement was not manufactured to
any great extent until it was introduced into Germany and Belgium. It
is still manufactured in those countries on a very extensive scale but up
to a few years ago little attention was given to improvements of the old
system. Its manufacture was not begun in this country to any great ex-
tent until about fifteen years ago. Up to 1891 over 80% of the cement
used in this country was imported from Europe. It was about this time
that engineers began to discover that cement could be produced here as
well as in Germany. Improved machinery was devised to compete against
the cheap hand labor of the European mills and as a result cement is
manufactured here.of equal strength and at far less cost than that of
foreign cements. At present practically all of the cement used in this
country is American made, except the small percentage used in the few
seaboard towns where a high freight makes importation profitable.
In the manufacture of this cement the factories are divided by the
nature of the process used in three classes; the wet, semi-wet and dry
processes. All methods being extensively used.
In mills operating under the dry or semi-dry processes the methods
of handling the raw materials are the same. The carbonate of lime is
generally obtained from dry lime stone or chalk rock and the silicates
from clay and shale. The rock and shale are quarried by the use of
air or steam drills and high explosives. Small surface cars are generally
used to transfer the quarried rock to the mill where it is crushed in


gyratory crushers of various sizes. In quarrying the shale, the fact that
it is readily disintegrated by the action of the air is sometimes utilized;
large masses of the shale being blasted loose to alfow the free action of the
air, thus permitting it to be more readily transported. It is then passed
through a pulverizer and stored in large bins separately from the rock.
The crushed rock has been reduced by this process to such a size that
nearly all of it will pass through a one-inch screen and the shale is in
the form of a coarse powder.
The materials are then passed separately through rotary dryers where
a small percentage of the moisture is removed. A portion of the rock is
then taken by weight and mixed with the correct amount of dried shale.
It is in determining the proportion of this mixture that the first work of
the operating chemist begins. Analyses of both materials are made and
the variation in chemical composition is so corrected as to result in a
mixture containing the proper elements to produce Portland cement The
materials are then ground to a fineness such that about ninety per cent
will pass through a sieve of one hundred meshes per lineal inch. Burr
stones were formerly used for this purpose but they have been replaced
by more economical grinding apparatus. A number of different types
of mills have been devised for grinding rock, but either a Griffin mill or
a combination of a ball and tube mill are generally used in this country.
The Griffin mill operates a revolving vertical shaft suspended from
a central point, on one end of which is a fixed round head about eighteen
inches in diameter with a six-inch face. This head rotates in a swinging
motion inside of a thirty-inch tire, thus generating a centrifugal force
which grinds the material between the surfaces of the head and tire.
Above the tire is a circular screen through which the rock is thrown by
an iron fan on the shaft as soon as it becomes sufficiently fine. It then
drops through openings in the bottom of the mlil where it is received by
suitable screw conveyors.
The ball mill consists of a circular shell about eight feet in diameter
by six feet in length lined with perforated steel plates. It contains a
number of round steel balls from three to five inches in diameter, which,
when the mill is revolved, fall on the pieces of rock and crush them till
they pass through the perforated plates and leave the mill. This mill
is not suitable for a finishing mill but is very good to reduce the crushed
rock sufficiently to allow about eighty per cent to pass through a twenty
mesh screen.
The tube mill is a steel cylinder twenty-two feet long by five feet in
diameter, revolving at about twenty-nine revolutions per minute. It is
lined with an extremely hard quartz and loaded with flint pebbles about
two inches in diameter. The material is reduced to the required fineness
by the pounding and rubbing of these pebbles. It is at this point that the


different methods are used which distinguish the mill as being of the dry
or semi-dry process. Under the dry process the ground rock is conveyed
from the mills and stored in suitable bins from which it is fed by feeding
mechanisms into the kilns. If the semi-dry process is used the powder
is mixed with thirty per cent of water making a thin mud or slurry.
This slurry is stored in steel tanks and is kept agitated by large revolving
sweeps or by blasts of compressed air until it is fed by gravity or pump
into the kilns.
In manufacturing cement under the dry or semi-dry process about
six hundred pounds of raw material are required to produce one barrel
of cement. It is thus seen that the water added under the semi-dry process
must be removed by burning. There is much discussion among cement
engineers as to the practical value of this system. While it requires an
extra amount of fuel to evaporate the added water, it is claimed that the
cost of this difference of fuel is compensated, especially in the natural
gas fields, by the power saved in grinding, less wear in the kilns, due to
lower temperatures and greater assurances of uniform cement of the best
quality. The raw material is used in the semi-dry process several per
cent coarser than in the dry process and it also allows a further correction
after grinding, which cannot be made under the dry process.
When marl is used to supply the carbonate of lime it is usually found
in a swamp or lake and mined by the use of a dredge. It is removed
to the plant by tram cars or is pumped by compressed air. The marl,
as it is usually obtained, contains between sixty and eighty per cent of
water. As four hundred fifty pounds of carbonate of lime are required
for one barrel of cement, this percentage shows that from fourteen
hundred to eighteen hundred pounds of water must be evaporated from
the marl for each barrel of cement. Due to the close union of the water
and marl, no mechanical process has yet been discovered for separating
them. The only possible way to remove the water without a prohibitive
consumption of fuel is by means of evaporation. The latter process was
formerly employed, always accompanied by a high cost of operation, but
with the invention of kilns designed to receive the raw material in the
form of slurry, the factories using marl are now operated under the wet
process. In the marl process the grinding is comparatively simple. The
marl is mixed by weight with the proper amount of clay and ground wet,
making an exceedingly fine slurry.
Under the wet and semi-dry processes the slurry is carefully tested
before being fed into the kilns. The test is an all important one and
determines almost entirely the quality of cement that will be produced by
the mill. The only mix thus far in the operation is the rough or approx-
imate one made when the two materials were first introduced to the mill.
The final test is now made and the exact correction made. If the mix


runs above the required percentage of rock, enough shale or clay is added
to secure the proper composition. The same treatment is made if the
mixture runs too high in shale, carbonate of lime being then added to
secure the proper composition. These tests are made with the greatest
precision on all materials before being allowed to leave the tanks. Any
number of corrections necessary are made to secure the correct composi-
tion for any particular materials. In the dry process this exact mix is
made by weight before the materials are ground which insures an intimate
mix by grinding.
A great number of different kilns or furnaces have been devised for
burning cement rock but only two have been extensively used. In the
European mills a type of vertical kiln is used. These kilns have a vertical
body similar to an inverted cone. The dried slurry is loaded into the
kiln in alternate layers with the fuel and fire placed at the bottom. The
heat and gases of the fire pass upward through the mass in irregular
openings, consequently the resulting clinker is not of a uniform nature,
part being overburned, part being underburned and part in the proper con-
dition, and all has to be' sorted before being used. The waste gases from
the kiln are conducted through long chambers so as to utilize the heat
of the kiln during operation for evaporating the moisture from the slurry.
When this type of kiln is properly built it is economical in fuel but re-
quires a great deal of hand labor for operation which is detrimental in
this country. These kilns have been placed in but few of the American
mills, those being among the first built.
The kilns in which practically all of the cement in this country is
burned are known as rotary kilns. They consist of a steel cylinder six
to seven feet in diameter by sixty to eighty feet in length, constructed of
steel sheets one-half to nine-sixteenths inches in thickness. This shell
revolves from one-fourth to one revolution per minute, and is carried
by very true locomotive tire steel rings which ride on cast steel rollers.
These rolls are so elevated that the kiln is deflected from the horizontal
between one-half to three-quarters of an inch per foot The kiln is
operated by a large girth gear into which meshes a train of gears that
reduce the speed from two hundred to one so as to receive power from
an electric motor or line shaft. When this type of fuel was first tried
much difficulty was experienced in securing- the proper combustion of
fuel. Its successful operation was first secured by the use of crude oil,
but owing to its cost, a substitute was necessary. Coal was then tried and
is now almost exclusively used except where natural gas is found in large
quantities. The coal is ground to a fineness of ninety per cent to pass
through a hundred mesh screen and is shot into the kiln by a continuous
blast of compressed air. The heat is regulated by varying the amount
of coal. If gas is used for a fuel it is generally passed


through a cast iron burner which creates the proper mixing of gas and
air for complete combustion. To burn or calcine the raw materials, a
heat of from twenty-eight hundred to thirty-two hundred degrees Fahr-
enheit is required. For this reason the kiln is lined for nearly its entire
length with from nine to twelve inches of extremely refractory brick.
In the process of burning the dry rock or slurry is fed into the upper end
of the kiln and gradually moved toward the lower end by its inclination
and revolution. The process is thus seen to be continuous and with the
variations in speed of kiln, the amount of raw material fed into it, and
the regulation of the amount of fuel, is entirely under the control of the
operator. The product thus formed is of uniform grade and all burned
to a proper degree of hardness.
The process of burning is a most important one in the manufacture
of cement and open to great improvement, consequently this department
receives probably more attention than any other of the operations involved.
The first successful rotary kiln was five feet in diameter by thirty feet
in length, but this size was gradually increased to six feet in diameter
and sixty feet in length which was regarded as standard until four or
five years ago. While this kiln has a greater capacity and gives more uni-
form results than the old type of vertical kiln, the amount of fuel re-
quired for its operation is much greater than that required by the old
system of burning.
The vertical kiln requires about forty pounds of coal to burn one barrel
of cement, while it requires from one hundred to one hundred fifty
pounds of coal to burn one barrel of cement in the rotary kiln. But when
the vertical kiln is used the raw material must be made up in the form
of briquettes and placed in the kiln and after being burned a certain
time, taken out. This is all accomplished by hand labor which prevents
the successful use of this kiln in this country.
After the practical success of the rotary kiln was established manu-
facturers began to modify the kiln in the hope of securing greater economy.
When this kiln is in operation it creates a stack temperature of from
seven to twelve hundred degrees Fahrenheit and the line of improvement
has been to endeavor to utilize this waste heat. A number of different
methods have been devised but only two have been developed to a work-
ing basis. By one method the waste gases are passed through steam
boilers supplemented by direct furnace fire, thus utilizing the waste heat
for the generation of power. The chief objections to this system are the
excessive cost of the complicated machinery, the difficulty of suitably
placing the boilers and furnaces and the presence of more or less dust
in the gases which behaves very unfavorably in the furnaces.
The other method is to utilize the hot gases to heat the raw material
which is done by increasing the length of the kilns. This idea is the


more practicable of the two and kilns were previously developed up to
a length of eighty feet beyond which, due to mechanical reasons, it was
not considered practical to continue. But this idea was most strikingly
developed in a factory designed by Thomas A. Edison where two kilns
were built nine feet in diameter by one hundred fifty feet in length.
These kilns produced the most economical results of any rotary kilns
yet made and burned cement with from twenty-five to thirty-five pounds
less coal per barrel than any kiln of this type up to this time has done.
However, a number of mechanical difficulties arose which interfered with
the continual operation of the kilns and for these reasons was not con-
sidered by many engineers a complete success. Several modifications of
this type of kiln have since been made in the hope of securing an ideal
size. In the year of 1902 four kilns seven feet in diameter by one hun-
dred feet in length were designed by the Hunt Engineering Company and
installed in the works of the Western Portland Cement Company two
years later. These kilns reduced the stack temperature to slightly over
four hundred degrees F. and gave such satisfactory results that the same
company is now equipping a plant in southern Kansas with ten kilns
eight feet in diameter by one hundred ten feet in length, so installed as to
operate under either the dry or semi-dry process.
The product as it is discharged from the rotary kiln is in the shape
of small, black and very hard pellets. It is very hot and must be cooled
before grinding. This is usually accomplished by some artificial means.
One method is to pass the clinker through a rotary cooler, similar in
construction to a rotary kiln with the exception of the lining, from three
to five feet in diameter and from thirty to fifty feet in length, through
which passes a forced blast of cold air. Another method is by the use
of large steel tanks in the body of which are placed perforated cast iron
ducts which divert currents of cold air through the heated mass. In
some mills it is cooled by slightly sprinkling with water and in others
by leaving it lay in large heaps to cool by radiation. About for percent
of gypsum is then mixed with the clinker and it is ground into cement by
the same style of mill as are used to reduce the rock.
The cement materials are subjected to chemical and physical tests
in all departments. These tests are conducted in laboratories which are
found at all plants. In the chemical department all chemical analyses
are made and the proportions of rock and shale are here determined. The
samples of slurry are here analyzed and the proper amount of correction
computed. The clinker is also analyzed to determine its soundness and
composition and the quality of burning. Also, a final test is made of all
finished cement before shipment A sample is also kept from each ship-
ment for future reference should any complaint be registered against any
shipment of cement


In the physical laboratory tests of strength, time of setting and re-
sults under accelerated conditions are determined. The cement is molded
into small briquettes about four inches long which are of one square inch
sectional area in the center and somewhat larger at each end. The
briquettes are pulled in two by a testing apparatus and tensile strength
per square inch thus registered. Small cubes are also made one inch on
edge and the load required to crush them noted. Briquettes made of
cement and twenty percent of water seven days old, must test about four
hundred fifty pounds tensile strength. The compressive strength is gen-
erally from twenty to twenty-five times the tensile strength.
The setting of cement is in two periods, designated as the initial and
final set. The initial set must take place in from twenty-five to forty
minutes and this is considered to be acquired when a sample of cement
will bear without indentation a wire one-twelfth inch in diameter and
loaded to weigh one-fourth of a pound. The final set is considered to
have been acquired when the mixture will bear a wire one-twenty-fourth
of an inch in diameter, loaded to weigh one pound. The time of setting
is regulated by the amount of gypsum ground into the cement. When
the clinker and gypsum are ground together every particle of cement is
covered with a coating of gypsum which requires a certain length of time
for the water to penetrate. It is this required time which delays the
action of the cement and water that determines the time of setting and is
regulated by the proper amount of gypsum. The accelerated tests are
intended to produce in a short time the same effect as that of longer
periods under a normal climatic condition. They consist chiefly in plac-
ing the hardened cement in cold water, in boiling water and under steam
pressure for several hours. The samples must in all cases remain per-
fectly sound and show no checks or abrasions in the surfaces. These
systems of testing serve as a check on the various processes of manufac-
ture, and guarantee to the consumer a product of the best quality.


THE MIXING OF CONCRETE.
By Ernest McCuiaouch, C. E.; Ass't. Enc. Bureau of Sewers, Chicago.
In the Cambria Hand Book allowable pressures for masonry per
square inch are as follows:
Ordinary stone 180 lbs.
Good stone 300 lbs.
Brick in lime mortar 150 lbs.
Brick in cement mortar 200 lbs.
Trautwine states that neither stone or brickwork should be trusted
with more than one-sixth to one-tenth the following loads, according to
circumstances:
Limestones and marbles 3470 to 13880 lbs.
Granites and syenites 4170 to 12500 lbs.
Connecticut brownstone 5555 to 13472 lbs.
Ordinary brick masonry 278 to 417 lbs.
Brick in good cement 700 to 972 lbs.
According to Trautwine therefore some of the allowable Cambria
loads for brickwork are excessive. It is likely the Cambria Hand Book
contemplates the best of brick while Trautwine takes ordinary house
brick.
While Trautwine and others recommend a factor of safety, of from
six to ten in all structures made of stone masonry and mention the same
factors for brick masonry, it is seldom so high factors are used for
brick, owing to the perfect control that may be had over the manufacture
of brick and good cement mortar.
Faults and well defined bedding planes and cleavage lines in natural
stone makes it impossible to rely upon most natural stones with any cer-
tainty for strength. Aside from the consideration of mere crushing
strength, must be also considered durability. Before any natural stone
can be used in an exposed situation trial must be made of its durability.
If no stone of the kind has been used in that neighborhood and there
is no past experience to govern, then chances must be taken. It requires
years to test a stone for durability and of the many accelerated tests in
use none so far have proven perfect. The pitiful appearance of much
expensive stone carving and the crumbling of many great edifices shows
lack of care, or perhaps lack of time used in selecting the stone.
In properly constructed concrete we have a material that is better than
the best natural stone. It is not an artificial stone for it imitates nothing.
It is a manufactured stone which is an improvement on the natural pro-
duct. It can have no greater strength than the materials of which it is


composed, but it can be made more uniform in texture and more depend-
able for strength and durability than the best of stone Nature produces
accidentally.
The impossibility of making an accurate chemical analysis of all stone
used prevents anything more than a good guess as to the probable ultimate
life in a structure. With brick and cement the uncertainty can be re-
duced to a reasonable minimum. With concrete it is still better.
Natural cement is made from materials found in a natural state, and
the manipulation of these materials necessary to convert them into cement
for the market is simple. Yet natural cement will not weather well for it
contains within itself the elements of destruction. Portland cement is
made of different elements found in a natural state but they are combined
in a laboratory and undergo processes that give them a maximum power
of resistance so that Portland cement is durable.
Portland cement in the process of manufacture is tried by water and
fire the two great enemies of all structures. It is therefore manifestly
fitted to be an ingredient of a manufactured stone. In nature many chem-
ical and mineral substances are combined and cemented together to form
a stone which, in the formation, takes to itself the elements that after-
wards combine with other elements in the atmosphere to accomplish its
destruction. In well made concrete the natural stone is taken together with
sand, or ground stone, and Portland cement is used in cementing medium
to bind them together. Proper cementation has two effects. One is to
give the material great strength, the other is to protect the concrete from
disintegration. These different results are obtained by the process of mix-
ing and good mixing therefore requires that every face of each piece of
stone and every face of each grain of sand be thoroughly coated with
cement mortar. In this way they are thoroughly cemented together and
at the same time protected from the atmospheric influences that may en-
danger the stone. It is to be remembered that each piece of stone and
each grain of sand carries in itself the seeds of dissolution the same as if
they were large blocks of stone. They must be protected from the at-
mosphere if concrete' is to be better than the stone it is supplanting.
This line of thought shows why the most important thing in the mak-
ing of concrete is the mixing. It is often said that all the voids in the
stone must be filled with sand and all the voids in the sand filled with
cement mortar. This simply insures strength. If we add that all faces
of both stone and sand shall be thoroughly coated with the weather re-
sisting cement then we have the best mixture. Some may say it means
the same thing but it does not. In the first definition it merely means
that a fairly dense material is obtained containing certain definite pro-
portions of aggregates that may, or may not, be uniformly distributed


throughout the mass. In the second it means absolute uniformity of
mixing—nothing Jess.
Concrete may be mixed by hand or by machine. There are three
methods of hand mixing. The first is to mix the sand and cement dry
until the mass is uniform in color. Then add water and make a paste.
Upon this paste throw the stone, which has been previously wet, and
turn the stone and paste over until the mass looks right. It is then ready
to go into place as concrete. This method of mixing is theoretically per-
fect but is slow and therefore seldom done with care.
Another method of hand mixing is to spread the stone as many
inches thick on a board as the concrete contains parts of stone. Over
this spread the sand evenly and upon the sand spread the cement evenly.
The mixing is done by putting shovels into the bottom of the pile so
each shovelfull contains approximately the right proportions. The mass
is turned over twice dry, being shovelled forward and then back. Then
it is turned twice while water is added through a hose nozzle. It gets
a fifth turning in being put into the wheelbarrows. The writer prefers
this method of mixing for two reasons. First it is as thorough as the
first method and, second, it can be done at much less expense and
expense is a great factor.
The third method consists in putting the materials on a platform as
described above and shovelling them into the upper end of an inclined
trough. This has spikes, shelves or other forms of baffles so the material
has to travel in a zigzag manner and during its progress water is added.
This is often called machine mixing and such a trough is called a gravity
mixer. The mixing is done however on the board and the zigzag travel
assists very little in the mixing process. The trough is only a conveyor
that prevents, to some extent, the separation of the aggregates according
to size and specific gravity. No one claims that each shovel contains,
in exact proportions, the aggregates taken on it, yet each shovelful travels
by itself down the incline. At the close of work it is safe to say the
structure contains the proportions measured into it but some places are
rich and some are poor in cement.
Mixing by shovels and hoes depends for results upon recognition of
the law of averages. This is proven by the table published in Engineering
News of Aug. 27, 1903, illustrating an article by Mr. Clarence Coleman,
U. S. Asst. Engr. He mixed many batches of cement mortar composed
of 1 cement and 3 sand. Some batches were mixed one minute, some
two, etc, until a maximum of ten minutes was reached. Tests were
made in 7 days, 28 days, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year and 2 years. In
7 days, mortar mixed ten minutes was 37 per cent stronger than mortar
mixed one minute. In two years, mortar mixed ten minutes was 19
per cent stronger than mortar mixed one minute. Of course in the time


between the seven day test and the two year test the concrete had in-
creased in strength as it is known to increase. The increase in the ten
minute mortar was not so great, expressed in percentages, as the increase
in the one minute mortar but it showed that the ten minute mortar was
the better and came nearer getting its maximum strength early than the
mortar mixed a shorter time. The above shows very clearly that the law
of averages must control in the hand mixing of concrete.
It is generally believed by men new in the concrete business that the
sole benefit of a mixing machine is the lessened cost of mixing. There-
fore to them any machine that puts concrete out quickly is good enough.
This explains why the gravity mixer had a great many friends at first
but now is used only where massive work is going in, and such a thing
as fibre stress is not considered.
The gravity mixer is not always convenient to use because the con-
crete must be delivered at a point considerably lower than the point
where the aggregates are piled. Therefore a class of mixers came in
called continuous mixers. They arc simply conveyors lying in a horizontal
plane and actuated by an engine. The materials are fed in at one end
and are delivered at the other. The materials are supposed to be fed
in three continuous streams and the actual mixing space is very short and
inadequate. The main function of the machine is to discharge at one
end, in a combined iorm. the materials fed in separately at the other end.
If such a machine is well arranged with an ample mixing space, and the
three streams of material meet with no mishap, fairly good concrete can
be produced. But the streams do not always flow evenly, and any les-
sening of weight in the piles behind the streams is effectual in disturbing
the proportions. In most of these machines the stream of cement causes
the greatest trouble. It is admitted that the poorest concrete is generally
used in street foundations, and we seldom see today any continuous
mixers used elsewhere under the charge of up to date engineers. Tl»e
greatest blow to continuous mixers was given during the past year by
the Underwriters Association in requiring concrete in fire proofed build-
ings to be mixed in batch mixers and refusing to allow hand mixing.
Batch mixers are mixers wherein each aggregate is placed in the
mixing receptacle in certain definite proportions in batches and each batch
is mixed the same length of time. Absolute uniformity of product is
thereby secured. The bag is generally taken as a unit, for one bag of
cement is usually considered as one cubic foot. We therefore have one,
two, three, etc. bag batch mixers. No preliminary mixing or arranging
is done outside the mixing receptacle. Each aggregate is measured and
thrown in, no attention being paid to the order of feeding, although some
attention to it might help in certain makes of machines.
But batch mixers depending upon inside mechanism, while superior


to continuous mixers, are still open to the objection that the law of aver-
ages applies to all mixers imitating the shovel action. The materials as
they go into the mixing receptacle are immediately caught up by the
deflecting mechanism and thrown around as with shovels. The process
is first separation and then combination. They are better than hand
mixing simply because a greater number of turns may be given the mater-
ial thus allowing the machine to mix in one minute as good concrete as
a shovel will mix in seven or eight minutes. Thus the machine at a
lower cost produces better concrete than shovels in the hands of men can
produce.
The cost of mixing alone is very low. The principal item of cost in
concrete manufacture is in the handling of the aggregates from the stock
piles to the mixer and from the mixer to the structure. The machine
has the further advantage that as the output is regular and practically
continuous it permits the use of various forms of conveying apparatus
better than wheelbarrows and carls operated by men or animals. Every
opportunity for the introduction of labor saving processes and machines
is a step towards increase of output with a consequent lowering of cost.
The writer has been asked the question: "How much superior is
machine mixed concrete to hand mixed concrete?" The best reply is to
refer to government publications.
On pp. 349-385, Report of the Watertown Arsenal, 1897, will be found
reports of tests of piers made with hand mixed concrete, and of piers
made with machine mixed concrete. The average compressive strength
of the hand mixed concrete was 989 lbs. per square inch and the average
compressive strength of machine mixed concrete was 1098 lbs. showing
an advantage of eleven per cent in favor of machine mixing. Other
tests made at the same place showed an advantage of twenty-five per
cent
On page 3784, Report of the Chief of Engineers, U. S. A., 1904, is
an interesting table showing the results of comparing hand mixed with
cube mixed concrete used in a pier in Duluth Harbor. The hand mixed
concrete was "first-class concrete" according to government requirements.
Forty-five briquettes of concrete (not mortar) were made and tested.
On a 7-day test the cube mixed concrete was 47 per cent the stronger.
On a 28-day test it was 23 per cent stronger. On a six-months test is was
16 per cent stronger. On a twelve-months test it was 13 per cent stronger.
Experienced contractors who have mixed concrete by liand and mixed
it with a machine generally figure that two yards per day of fair con-
crete is close to the limit per man in a hand mixing gang. With a proper
machine at least seven yards per day per man can be counted on, and
the concrete is better. The writer from an extended experience in con-


crete work, and an intimate acquaintance, from actual use, with the lead-
ing machines in the market, feels the above to be a fair comparison.
The cube mixer, in its most improved form, is fed on one side and
is discharged from the other side by tilting; not ceasing to revolve during
the process of loading, mixing and discharging. The cube was suggested
to a United States Engineer in the '70s (said to have been General
Meiggs) and it has remained a prime favorite with the engineers of the
Engineer Corps ever since. It is suspended on an axis going through
diagonally opposite corners. The mixing process takes advantage of one
of nature's well known laws, the tendency of materials when disturbed
to consolidate and fill all voids.
It is recommended in using a cube concrete mixer that the coarser
material be fed in first and that the cement go in last. As it does not
mix by first separating the aggregates and then recombining them, this
method of feeding in the aggregates insures that the mixing will be
done in the best possible manner.
When granular materials of varying sizes are disturbed the finer
material will work down into the interstices. In a cube, the corners
between the corners by which the cube is suspended, lie alternately on
either side of the median line. As the cube revolves the aggregates
move en masse from side to side and this movement tends to work the
finer material down into the voids. In addition to this as the cube
revolves slowly each side draws up in a thin sheet the materials that
hang to it because of their weight and when it rises to a point where,
the angle of repose is exceeded the material doubles over and flows down
in a thin sheet over the mass below. There are six sides at different
angles and each side delivers its sheet in time to partly cover the sheet
thrown over by the opposite side, and in its turn to be partly covered
by a sheet from a side opposite and at another angle.
There is absolutely no throwing from side to side in a cube, thus
causing severe strains on the operating mechanism. It is simply a slicing
and covering of the material combined with a shaking that tends to fill
the voids. How perfectly this is done can be imagined from an experi-
ment lately made in the coloring of mortar. Some mortar was mixed
in a cube and in a blade machine. In the mortar was put some coloring
matter in the form of a powder. After the mortar had set the blocks
were broken open. In the mortar mixed in the cube the coloring matter
was distributed evenly and no streaks could be discovered on the closest
examination. The mortar mixed in the blade machines had the coloring
matter distributed through it in streaks. If the mortar had been man-
ipulated long enough in the blade machine it also might have been evenly
colored. The test, however, was made to see which mixed the most
efficiently in the shortest time. The batches were proportioned alike and


mixed the same time in the respective machines. This test proved that
the mixing action in the cube must be far superior to any mixing action
imitating the shovel in a workman's hand.
The compressive strength of concrete varies from 600 pounds per
square inch to as much as 4,000 pounds. Plans for reinforced concrete
structures uniformly count on a working compressive strength of 500
pounds. Yet the mixing of concrete is not given nearly the importance
it demands. If the concrete is mixed as too many building blocks are
made there is no factor of safety. If a little more care is used a com-
pressive strength of 1,000 pounds may be developed and we have a factor
of safety of 2. It is a safe thing to say that we are apt any day to
read of disasters caused by the giving out of concrete strained far beyond
its strength.
To the mixing of concrete therefore the engineer in charge of con-
struction -work should pay close attention. If reinforced concrete is used
hand mix-ing is not to be considered and if the surface of the work is
to be exposed see that only the best Port'and cement is u«ed and insist
upon a close texture in the finished material. Perfect mixing accom-
plishes the result of getting the greatest strength to resist pressure and
shock as well as to resist the moisture in the atmosphere; the greatest
solvent and destructive influence in nature.


NOTES ON THE COMPARATIVE EFFICIENCY OF GAS
AND STEAM POWER PLANTS.
BY J. K. BIBBINS, 99E.
It is a favorite subterfuge of the engine builder who is engaged in
competition with steam turbine or gas power, that with all the boasted
economics on the "new fangled" prime movers, the extra cost of up-keep
and other items, either fancied or real, soon reverse the advantages over
steam power apparent at the start. That there is, after all, a semblance
of truth in such an apparently irresponsible statement, develops from a
study of economies of the case. An illustration may be of interest
to readers of the Technic. Incidentally, an insight may be had into the
striking economy of gas power plants, and the possibilities for their future
development.
FUEL ECONOMY.
Accurate comparative duty tests on gas and steam plants under sim
ilar conditions are exceedingly rare. By far the most comprehensive tests
yet conducted are those of the United States Geological Survey begun
in St. Louis in 1904. In table No. 1 are summarized tests on fuels rang-
ing between the richest West Virginia bituminous, and the poorest western
lignites, the former running above 14,000 B. T. U. per pound, and the
latter below 7,000 B. T. U. per pound in normal state. In figures Nos.
1 and 2 the effect of varying grades of fuel on plant economy is brought
out; figure No. 1 relating to the gas plant, with coal as actually fired;
Figure No. 2, to both gas and steam plants, with coal corrected for
moisture.*
In Figure No. 1, the moisture content of the low grade lignites largely
increases the fuel rate of the plant. Corrected for moisture, the fuel
rate presents the striikng feature of being practically constant within a
wide range of calorific value, as shown in the lower curves of Figure No.
2. This shows that the kinetic efficiency of the producer-gas engine plant
is almost as high with low as with high grade fuels. At an average of
12,500 B. T. U. per pound, the gas plant duty (dry coal) approximated
2 pounds per Kw. hour, corresponding to a plant efficiency of 16%.
* Both plants consisted of simple engines belted to 175 Kw. generat-
or; the gas engine, a vertical three cylinder single-acting Westinghouse
type; the steam engine, a single cylinder non-condensing Corliss type.

With the steam plant, the results are quite different, as indicated by
the upper curve in Figure No. 2. Lying well above the gas plant line,
the curvature is much more pronounced with the poorer grades of fuel.
As both the steam and gas engine presumably worked at a constant effi-
ciency, the curvature indicates the rapid decrease in the efficiency of the
steam boiler and furnace with low grade fuels, as compared with the
producer plant. For instance, with 12,500 B. T. U. coal, (dry) 5.8 pounds
were consumed per Kw. hour, corresponding to the plant efficiency of
only sVi%.
These data, of course, pertain to a non-condensing steam plant. With
condenser, the fuel ratio of approximately 3 to 1 would presumably be
reduced to 2 to 1 for the steam and gas respectively.

COMMERCIAL ECONOMY.
Passing now to the purely commercial side of the subject, we are
confronted with the question: how much of this saving in favor of gas
power will be absorbed by investment or capital charges, against the
plant, and what conditions, if any, limit its use as against steam.
Taking a concrete case, let us assume two 5,000 Kw. plants, one
steam, the other gas, operating on a street railway load such as Figure
No. 3, which is an actual load curve taken from the Pittsburg Railways
system. Blocking in units ,as shown, we obtain an electrical load factor


of 66%, and an average engine load of 83% rating. Assume further effi-
ciencies for a modern high grade installation, as follows:

In estimating the operating cost of power, it is necessary to take into
account not only the ordinary items of
Fuel

Supplies
Repairs
Works Cost
or
Operating Cost


but also all other fixed or floating charges involved in the original in-
vestment, such as,
Interest
Depreciation
Taxes r Fixed Costs
Insurance
Management
These all constitute fixed charges.
It is safe to say that the inclusion of purely fixed charges in power
accounts is, in this country at least, unusual; so much so, that seldom
is the same basis of charging employed even in similar plants. Referring
particularly to the depreciation item, some plants carry a sinking or
amortisement fund which, accumulating through a given term of years,
will be sufficient to replace plant at the end of such term. Others "charge
off' to depreciation each year as much as the dividend rate will allow.
In still other cases no depreciation at all is allowed, and the repairs and
maintenance account is padded with "betterments" when it becomes too
heavy, whereas "betterments" should refer distinctly to improvements or
extensions of physical equipment.
By constant repair, a machine may, it is often claimed, be preserved
in its original state of efficiency and physical value; hence the absence of
sinking funds in some cases. A less radical judgment, however, indicates
the most reasonable disposition of the depreciation charge in two distinct
items—running repairs and commercial depreciation; the former a regular
station charge, the latter determined largely by the advancement of the
builder's art.
A careful estimate of capital cost of the two complete plants, not
including real estate or especially elaborate buildings, totals about as
follows:
GAS PLANT STEAM PLANT
Generating Plant $7720 $43-6o
Producer-Boiler Plant 25.06 27.30
Buildings, Coal Storage, Switching Apparatus 16.50 18.00
Total, $ per Kw. hour 118.76 89.10
Excess Cost of Gas Plant, $29.66=30%.
Depreciation is here taken as physical depreciation only, averaging
5.8% on the several parts of the gas, and 6.2% on the steam plant. Other
fixed charges are equalized.
Operating costs are now clearly defined, except as to the items of
Labor, Supplies, and Repairs, which as a total, usually vary but little in
large plants. As all evidence at hand does not point to a striking
advantage either in favor of gas or steam, these charges are equalized at
the conservative figure of five cents per Kw. hour.


39
The complete computation may now be embodied in such a diagram
as Fig. No. 4, which shows the total cost of Power by Steam or Gas with
different prices of fuel. From the lower pair of diagonals, "Cost of Fuel,"
it is evident that the gas plant has a decided advantage. Adding the
remaining operating costs, the second pair of diagonals show "Total Oper-
ating Costs" still in favor of gas. With fixed charges included, however,
the advantage of gas power is reversed within a certain range of cheap
coal. The intersection of the "Total Cost" lines defines the lower limit
of commercial advantages of gas over steam. With coal costing less than
95 cents per ton, we cannot afford to use gas, but above this figure, the
saving rapidly increases.
Expressing this relation in terms of Annual Saving in Percent of Excess
Cost of Power Plant, we have Fig. No. 5- Thus, with coal costing 14 cents
per million B. T. U., or about $375 per ton, the gas plant will return a
net saving of 30% of its excess cost per year. Conversely the entire
difference will be made up in between three and four years. The limit
is at 05-cent coal, as before. With free coal, such as may be obtained
at the mine mouth, the gas plant would operate at an annual loss of 10%.
Expressing this saving in a still different manner, as the "Time required
to liquidate the excess cost of Gas over Steam Plant," we have a diagram


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC.
of the form of Fig. No. 6—a rectangular hyperbola. The location of the
(Y) asymptote indicates again the limiting cost of coal. As the lower
lobe of the hyperbola lies entirely beneath the (X) axis, it is evident
that a saving over steam can never be realized, even though the fuel
were actually subsidized or obtained at a premium.
The above treatment of the problem is admittedly tentative, as it
is necessarily based on estimates, yet it serves its purpose in exposing
the fallacy that Gas Power Plants are a source of revenue under any and
all conditions; the cheaper the fuel the better. It is evident from Fig.


41
No. 4 that with fuel coal, gas power can only compete with steam power
when either one or both of two things have occurred:
(1) Elimination of Excess Capital Cost.
(2) Reduction of Operating Costs other than Fuel sufficient to null-
ify excess fixed charges.
Of the two, the latter is the more probable, owing to the inherent
simplicity of gas plant operation, and the absence of certain losses insep-
Ficube No. 6.
arable from steam plant operation. The former may come as a result of
gradual elimination of expansion and unessential mechanism in Gas
Engine construction. Some reduction in capital cost may be looked for
in the near future, due to the better matching of engine and generator,
with reference to the overload capacity of the unit. While the generator
can withstand continuous overloads of 25% to 50% without undue heating,
the engine cannot ordinarily develop above 10% of its generator rating.
A considerable excess of generator capacity is thus practically wasted,
and a smaller generator may be employed which will still keep within


standard temperature specifications, at the same time reducing the cost
of the unit.
The Gas Power problem thus partakes of the nature of economics,
rather than mechanics, and must not be treated superficially. Often con-
siderations entirely foreign to questions of operating economy constitute
the real issue at stake. In several plants known to Author, producer gas
was required for metallurgical purposes. Gas engines were adopted as
a second thought and now actually use only the waste "air" gas made
while blowing the producers preparatory to making a run of rich gas.
By this means the fuel cost of power is practically nil.
Fortunately the internal combustion engine is able to burn, with
practically the same efficiency, about any combustible previously con-
verted into a fixed gas: from an oil gas of 2000, or over, B. T. U. per
cubic foot, to air and blast furnace gases of 85 to 90 B. T. U. per cubic
foot. Herein lies one of the most advantageous features.


A TALK TO MECHANICAL ENGINEERING STUDENTS
By E. S. Reid, '93, Engineer Northern Engineering Works, Detroit.
A mechanical engineer's opportunities is a subject of especial interest
to the young man preparing himself for this profession. Older men who
have established themselves in their work know. They have put up a hard
fight for their opportunities and have won them. Their opportunities are
all about them. They are too busy to speculate much on the subject.
Not so the young man who has just decided to fit himself for the profes-
sion, nor the young man just completing his college course. ^To such a
3-oung man the question is a vexatious one.
Very few men start on a college course of engineering with a very
clear idea of the profession it leads to. Even fewer of them have a defi-
nite line of work they intend to follow for their livelihood. Therefore
it is to these young men in particular that I am writing.
Most of you young men find that things mechanical have an absorb-
ing interest for you. Every day you read of the accomplishments and
doings of men skilled in mechanical knowledge. Very often you are for-
tunate enough to see fine examples of their work. You want to do these
things. You would count it an honor to be a builder and a maker in
the mechanical world. That is right. And you must have that idea so
strong that it will hold you resolutely to your task of a long preparation.
And right here let me say that you can rest assured you have chosen
a profession which will fully satisfy your aspirations. It will open a broad
field to your ambition. It will give you abundant opportunity for work
and an honorable career.
Of course you want to enjoy your work. And you will enjoy it if
you are successful. We all enjoy doing the work we can do well. We
take pride in it. We arc glad to do the things we excel in. So will
it be with our work as a mechanical engineer. If you are to enjoy your
work you must do it well, like it, live it. You cannot do this unless you
are well equipped. I mean naturally well equipped at the beginning. You
must have health. The college preparation may be confining; still it has
considerable recreation and many diversions. But later the wear and tear
of business, the steady grind of work, the never-let-up of it all will be
too much for you unless you are equipped witli good health. Then again,
there is the natural mental equipment or aptitude. You must have that
too. You must be a chap who is intent on knowing how things are
built and why things are built as they are; then there is a possibility of


your being good material for a future mechanical engineer. And still
more important, you must be constructive. You must like to build things
for the sake of building them. You must always be intent on building
your ideas into concrete form. You must want to see them actually before
you.
If you are such a youth you have an aptitude for engineering. But
you must have it unmistakably. It must be one of your marked charac-
teristics. You must have it so strongly that it will hold you steadily
to the task of preparation and make you impatient to do the real work of
an engineer and make you know you will enjoy it.
Every thoughtful young man contemplates his future career. You
have often contemplated yours. If you have not you are not thoughtful
and earnest. You must be earnest or be of no account at all. In contem-
plating your future career you see that the world's work has gone on so
far very well without you. It is not hard for you to see that the world's
work can continue to go on very readily without your help at all. In
fact you must make a place for yourself in it. You must crowd yourself
right in. You must do your own crowding too. Influence and friends
will not do. You will be disappointed if you rely on them. It will be a
waste of time to try them. Rely on yourself. Do your own hustling.
This brings up the consideration of that important first step of getting
your first position. After you graduate from technical school, college, or
university, you must find a place to work. You must try your hand at
something. Someone must give you a chance. Now every man who has
chances to give is a busy man. Such men belong to a busy world. They
have little time for you. They cannot give you much consideration. If
they need you and you are right there ready to be tried, well and good,
you get a chance. It is the chance for you.
If you want consideration, go yourself. Your letter of application
is not you. You may be hours away from the man who reads your letter.
He thinks he might use you. If you were on the spot, alert and keen for
work, he would snap you right up. As it is, he hesitates to ask you to
come to him. He thinks perhaps you might not do at all. Your letter
reads well but your letter is not you. Go yourself. Your chances will
be ten times better.
There are always good positions just waiting for the right man to
come along. Yet it is hard to find the man who has one for you. You
may pass the door to the position you need day after day. Again you may
be a day too early or a day too late. Conditions change in the business
and working world every day. You must be always on hand, ever on
the hunt. Sooner or later you will meet the man with a position for you
to fill and fill right away. The reason you get the position and some other
fellow does not is because you are on the ground, and the other fellow


is not. There is no luck or chance about it Get out and look long enough
and you will get your chance to crowd in.
Take the first likely opening that you find. It does not matter much
where you start or what you begin doing. Start at something. That is
the point. Get experience at actually doing something. It will give you
a chance to do a lot of better and more important things later on. Really it
is not an important matter what you do for the first year or two of your
career as a mechanical engineer so long as you work in some line of your
chosen profession. The all important matter is to do something. Do
your work well and get some experience.
We do not all want to follow the same line of mechanical engineering.
There are many special lines each requiring years of attention and exper-
ience to master. You may fancy some one line more to your liking than
any other. Perhaps you are right, but you may be sure that almost
any line which happens to first offer itself to you has many interesting
points and advantages. It contains a lot for you to master. It surely
has a future career for someone. Why not for you? At any rate you
will be wise to stay at it until it has given you something worth while or
or until you are sure you have exhausted its possibilities for you.
In the meantime, while you are following your particular line of en-
gineering keep your eyes open and learn about other lines. It is the
worker who gets this opportunity to learn. Your work will bring you in
contact with other engineers doing other things. See what they are
doing and how they do it. Observe, study, and understand their work.
You may be wanted for their work and what you observe will be just
the knowledge to qualify you to undertake broader and bigger things.
It is a golden opportunity to be doing something. That is why it is so
essentia] for you, the young man just starting out, to begin on the first
work that needs you. You will soon be more than wanted. You will be
a necessity.
After you, young man, once get started in the life and work of
a mechanical engineer your opportunities will begin to appear. Your
chances will come to develop and broaden out in positions of responsibility
and trust. You will appreciate the close relationship of business and
engineering. You will profit by your combined engineering and business
experience. Your opportunity is a grand one. Make the best of it and
you will have reason to be proud of your chosen profession.


TIME TESTS OF JUMP SPARK COILS.
Thesis by W. C. Smith, '05, and J. H. Hunt, '05.
It has long been known that in a gas engine the explosion does not
occur instantaneously with the completion of the primary circuit by the
contact maker. The reason for this has usually been attributed almost
entirely to the time required for the ignition to move through the gas,
i. e., the explosion takes a certain minute time. Where j ump spark ignition
is used, it is admitted that part of the time elapsing is due to the time
required to build up the field sufficiently to cause the spark to leap the
gap. Where vibrator coils are used it seems evident that, since the spark
cannot occur until after the primary circuit is broken by the action of
the vibrator, the construction and adjustment of the vibrator apparatus
would have considerable effect upon the time required for the coil to act
The purpose of this investigation is to determine, if possible, first; if
there is an appreciable amount of time required for the action of the
coil and vibrator; and secondly, if there is such a time interval, how a
variation of the conditions under which the coils act would affect this time.
APPARATUS.
The apparatus was set up as shown, Fig. 1. The motor (M) which
furnished the motion was an "Apple Igniter" with a rheostat connected
in series with the armature to permit of speed variation. As a dynamo
it is designed to give a pressure of 12 volts at 1400 R. P. M. Used as
a shunt motor, we found that it would run practically continuously with-
out overheating the field under a pressure of 16 volts. When about 25
volts were applied the field soon began to heat and the speed ran up to
igoo and 2000 R. P. M. At the end of a twenty-minutes run, the field
had become as hot as we considered it safe to run. At this point we might
note that the variation in speed of consecutive readings does not necessarily
indicate that the readings are in error since the heating of the field coil
increases its resistance and reduces the exciting current; so that the
speed varies, slower when the machine has been resting, and faster when
several readings are taken close together. The motor received its current
from the storage battery (S. B.), usually being connected to four cells.
A double-pole knife switch, designated as the key K, controlled this
circuit. Upon an extension of the motor shaft and rigidly attached thereto
was a five inch cast iron disk (D), around whose periphery was placed
a smoked paper strip. A small slot, used in connection with a wooden
wedge, served to hold the strip in place on the disk. In order to close


the primary circuit of the induction coil (I. C.) at a certain point in the
revolution, there was attached rigidly to the shaft a contact-maker (C. M.),
giving a certain arc of contact in the same portion of each revolution
In the first part of our tests a cam contact-maker with a contact arc of
70 degrees was used, while the latter runs a Hertz timer (4 point),
with an arc of 36 degrees served to close the primary circuit
As usual, the primary circuit was grounded on the motor. The
current may be traced from this point through the shaft and contact-

maker; through an ammeter A, through a snap switch, designated as
K», into a battery B of from two to eight Columbia dry-cells; from the
battery through the vibrator of the induction coil (I. C.) and its primary
back to the "grounded" terminal. A voltmeter (V) was placed across
the batteries as shown, in order to obtain readings of the pressure in
the primary coil.
In the secondary circuit of the induction coil were placed two gaps
across which, of course, a spark leaped at each break of the primary cir-
cuit. One of these gaps (Gi) was between a movable steel point and
the disk. The steel point was thrust through a hole in the end of a rod,
which in turn was through a hole drilled in the top of the post (P) set


in front of the disk. Both rod and point were held in place by set
screws. The post was turned so that by sliding the rod back and forth
the point was moved across the face of the disk, and in a direction
parallel to its axis. This post was connected through gap (G«) to the
high potential terminal of the induction coil (I. C.) and the common
terminal was "grounded" to the motor frame.
The other gap (GO was between two steel points enclosed in a glass
tube. One of these points was movable, permitting variation in the
length of gap at this point. The gauge glass tube was closed at the
ends by cemented plugs, through which passed the terminals of gap (G«).
Into one end was connected an ordinary bicycle valve, the intention being
to compress the air in the tube by means of a bicycle pump. However,
other means had to be employed, since the leakage of the various con-
nections was so great that the pressure could not be maintained at any
steady value. At the other end a threaded nipple was put in for con-
necting to a gauge, by means of a small flexible pipe.
Thus the secondary circuit may be traced from the high potential
terminal of the coil through (Gi) to the point (P), thence across the
gap (Gi) to the disk, and from there to the "grounded" terminal and back
to the other terminal of the secondary winding.
A speed counter, several hundred strips of paper for records, a small
lamp for smoking these strips, and a bottle of shellac in alcohol completed
the apparatus as used by us in the tests.
In order to avoid confusion, the coils we used will hereafter be
designated as follows: •
No. i. Coil marked Nilmelior.
No. 2. Old coil marked Oldsmobile.
No. 3. New coil marked Oldsmobile.
No. 4. Western Electric Oldsmobile.
No. 5. Cylindrical coil, brand unknown.
No. 6. "National" Coil.
METHOD OF OPERATION.
Our method of operation in taking each record was as follows: A
record was first placed on the disk (see Fig. 1), which was five inches
in diameter and one inch wide. A record was a strip of tough white
paper fastened by means of a wooden wedge, as explained above. At the
point where the spark leaped the gap first, and for about three or four
inches in the direction of rotation, the paper was covered with lamp-
black by holding it above a smoky kerosene flame. The disk was then
turned slowly by hand in the direction of rotation after closing switch (K).
When the primary was closed a spark would leap the gaps (Gi) and
(Gj) and at the point where the spark in gap (Gi) struck the disk, the
carbon particles were thrown violently away, leaving a white spot, in the


middle of which was usually burned a small hole, noticeable only when
the record was held up to the light. This spot showed the angular
position of the shaft when contact was first made, since the rate of rota-
tion was so slow that its effect may be ignored.
The primary circuit was opened at switch (K5) as soon as the first
sparks appeared, since otherwise a stream of sparks would follow as long
as the circuit was closed through the contact-maker, and spoil the portion
needed for the secondary record. The motor was then set in motion by
closing switch (Ki), and after it had come up to speed, the revolutions
were taken for thirty-second intervals. At this point we may mention
that only a speed counter requiring very little power to run it was found
applicable, because a heavy one would seriously affect the speed. For
about five seconds in the middle of the time during which speed.was taken,
the switch (Ki) was closed, so that the primary circuit was completed
through the contact maker once every revolution, and a spark leaped the
gap at least once for such contact. When the motor &gt;was stopped it was
found that the sparks had not struck the disk at the same point as be-
fore, but that there was a space between the points, this space being the
distance passed through by the periphery of the disk while the coil was
acting. Thus, if the distance between the first spot, when turned slowly
by hand, and the one obtained when the motor was running at speed of

We closed the primary circuit at the middle of the time we were tak-
ing speed, because we found that the speed varied considerably as the
temperature of its field varied; and assuming that the speed varies uni-
formly, our speed counter reading gives us the speed when the record
was taken. We closed the switch (Ks) for four or five seconds to per-
mit the vibrator to get into synchronism with the contacts, the effect of
this being explained below. Upon removal, the records were bathed in
a fixing solution, and allowed to dry.
For the general outline of this method we are indebted to Mr. B. F.
Bailey of the Engineering Department.
DISCUSSION OF TYPICAL RECORDS.
Photograph, Fig. 2, shows seven typical records, obtained in the man-
ner explained above. The strip marked "A" is record No. 203, and is a
part of the test of Coil No. 1. The cam contact-maker was used and
four Columbia dry cells furnished the energy. The long spot at the top

of the record was obtained as the disk was turned slowly by hand, and the
lower spot was obtained by closing the primary circuit when the motor
had attained a speed of 1650 R. P. M. The distance 3.03 inches was
measured from the first hole through the paper in the upper spot to the
first hole in the lower one. The reason for assuming that this gives us
the proper time is that it shows the best working conditions of the coil
which occurs only after vibrator's motion becomes "tuned" to the im-
pulses sent into the primary by the action of the contact-maker. Generally
speaking, the first spark obtained gives the last hole in the lower spot,
and then as the vibrator gets into motion, sparks come earlier until the
best working conditions are reached.

This fact is illustrated in strip C which was obtained during the test
of Coil No. 6. In this case, the Hertz timer was used, and a slower
speed was necessary if any spark was to be obtained. Beginning at the
right hand side of the strip, records 1106 to mo inclusive arc shown.
When the primary was closed one second approximately (record 1106)
the best time was 0.00955 seconds; when three seconds, 0.00899 seconds;
when five seconds, 0.00856 seconds; when 10 seconds, 0.00813 seconds;
when 15 seconds, 0.00677 seconds. This last record is apparently in error
as a result of some unknown condition. In other cases where this experi-
ment was tried, no appreciable change in time was found after, say five
seconds. These records were obtained at a speed averaging 400 R. P. M.
Now if the contact-maker shaft is running at a higher speed, say
780, the time that the primary current is closed has apparently no effect
on the time elapsing between primary contact and spark. This is illus-


trated on record G, numbers 1116 to 1120 inclusive. At present we can-
not attempt to explain this phenomenon, as well as many other vagaries
of vibration coils.
Strip B, records 861 to 865 inclusive, is merely a typical record ob-
tained by using a Hertz timer and slow speed, say 6go.
Strip D, records 921 to 925 inclusive, is practically the same except
that it exhibits the peculiarity of having an occasional spark occurring
in about 90% of the time required for the average one.
Strip E, records 426 to 430, shows where apparently the coil gives
two sparks during one contact, the time between the first and second
sparks being nearly the time required for the first spark after the primary
circuit has been closed by the contact-maker. This same action is illus-
trated on Strip C and also on Strip F, records 701 to 705. In this latter
case (F), however, the time required for the first spark after contact is
shorter than that between the first and second sparks. The only explana-
tion we can give for this difference in the relative times of the two sparks
is in a probable difference in the construction of the vibrators.
We desire to call attention to the fact that the coil, No. 4, used for
the Strip F was the fastest coil we tested, its best record being 0.00402 sec-
onds; the best time of coil No. I, on the other hand, was 0.00587, the
voltage being the same in the two cases.
RESULTS.
We must first call attention to the fact that the time elapsing as meas-
ured by us, was almost entirely the time required for the vibrator to act.
We tried using a non-vibrating coil, but our apparatus was too crude to
give us any results. We placed the contact-maker as nearly as possible
in the position of the break of the primary circuit, and by making and
breaking the circuit produced a spark. However, when we closed the
circuit with the machine running, the spark came apparently at the same
point as before, or so close that we are not justified in computing any
definite time, although apparently a very few ten-thousandths of a second
had elapsed. It would be very interesting to construct a contact-maker
giving a break at a definite point in the revolution at all speeds, and see
if it would be possible to measure this time.
It is obvious that if there be a definite time required for the spark
to act the contact must come earlier than the spark is needed for ignition
in a running engine. We timed the Splitdorf Coil used on the Olds-
mobile runabout engine in the mechanical laboratory, and found its
average time to be about 4.6 thousandths of a second. Now if the engine
be running at a speed of 644 R. P. M. the secondary shaft will be running
at a speed of 322 R. P. M., and during 0.0046 seconds it will turn through
an angle of 8.9 degrees, or about 9 degrees lead is required for the coil to


act at this speed. Now for a thirty pound load on the brake, as per test
by Mr. R. G. Stewart, a lead of 40 degrees was used, thirty-one degrees
must therefore be due to the time it takes for ignition, and also to the
fact that the exploding gases must have a cushioning effect upon the
inertia of the reciprocating parts. For heavier loads, say fifty pounds, at
the same speed, more of the inertia of the parts is taken up by the load,
so less lead is used, in this case only 20 degrees; which allows 11 degrees
for ignition and cushion effect.
When the applied voltage was varied, the results are best seen by
consulting the curves (in Fig. 4). For every coil (No. 1 possibly except-
ed) increasing the voltage appears to shorten the time considerably, al-
though coils 3 and 5 are much less affected by voltage variation than 2
and 4. We cannot explain the erratic action of Coil No. I, but call at-
tention to the fact that its behavior was again peculiar, when the ad-
justment of the vibrator was varied.
We notice that there was a certain minimum amount of energy nec-
essary if we were to obtain a spark in the secondary circuit. The power
consumed for coil No. 4 was computed and we found that although the
power fell off as the voltage was decreased, the current increased slightly
as the voltage fell, so that the power does not fall off as the square of
the voltage, as would occur in an ordinary circuit of fixed resistance.
Because of the effect of the self induction of the primary circuit at
high speed the same quantity of electricity will not get through the con-
tact-maker, although the circuit is of course closed for the same percent
of the time as at a lower speed; but is not closed for so long a time at
any one contact; and if this current is so small that insufficient power
is taken by the coil, no secondary spark is obtained, although the vibrator
may be working well. Thus with the Hertz timer the speeds could not
be nearly so high as with the cam contact-maker, the arcs being 36 de-
grees and 70 degrees respectively.
When the adjustment of the vibrator was varied (see Fig. 3), it was
found that the more current taken when the primary circuit was closed
continuously, the larger the time. That is, when the larger currents were
used, the vibrators seemed to stick, and although the coils gave powerful
sparks for the greater currents when the machine was not running; when
running the action was not nearly as good as when the vibrator was ad-
justed to take the smaller currents.
We noticed also that the current when running did not increase in
the same proportion as did the current when the machine was still. Both
dry cells and storage batteries were used on coils during this test, no
particular difference in the action being discovered.
The value of the current given is the reading of the ammeter in the

primary circuit and is a sort of an average of the varying values of the
current, which pulsate from a zero to a maximum.
Our means of measuring gap (G.) did not permit of very accurate
measurement, so we only tested coils giving powerful sparks for the
effect of variations of length of air gap. As seen in Fig. 5, varying the
gap has apparently no appreciable effect on the time. Theoretically, a
stronger field would need to be built up and more time required, but this
difference is so small that we failed to detect it.
In a gas engine, the mixture is under compression at the time the
spark is passed and we thought it advisable to try the effect of pressure
on the time. As seen in Fig 6 and as might be expected from the results
obtained on varying gap, pressure variation did not affect the time.
As an apology for giving upon only one coil for this test, we might
state that is was necessary to run an air compressor and keep a small
boiler charged to 80 pounds pressure for our supply; and that atmospheric
conditions on this day were such that all insulation was practically worth-
less; in fact we had to insulate ourselves from the floor by dry boards
and paper, and even then received severe shocks on touching parts of the
apparatus, even including the dry cells. When a coil giving stronger
sparks were used, the insulation broke down completely so that although
we obtained a spark in gap (C) there was none in the compression
chamber, due to the many short circuits between the various parts of the
apparatus.
CONCLUSION.
From the above mentioned results, we see that any condition affecting
the primary circuit will affect the action of the vibrating apparatus, and
therefore the time; while, on the other hand, any change of the condi-
tions in the secondary circuit, which cannot affect the vibrator, does not
appreciably affect the time.


DISCUSSION ON COMPOUNDING THE GAS ENGINE.
Thesis by E. Burton Mead, 'oo.
At the outset, the object of this investigation was to design a com-
pound gas engine. To this end, the work has proved to be a failure. It
has, however, developed some good reasons why a compound gas engine
is impractical. Hoping that these may be of value to those interested in
gas engine work, I submit them in the following.
In the best practice the gas engine throws away more energy in the
exhaust than it converts in to work. The temperatures and pressure
of the exhaust being high the first thing an engineer thinks of is to further
expand the gases beyond the volume of the cylinder; that is, to com-
pound the engine. There have been many so-called compound engines
put on the market and there are some on the market today, but none of
these have been really compound engines in the ordinary sense of the
term. They have used two cylinders in various ways but not as we
would ordinarily call "compounding." Many of these engines have de-
monstrated, however, that hot gases can be passed from one cylinder to
another through short ports with surprisingly small loss of heat.
The temperature of the gases exhausted from an ordinary Otto cycle
engine is often one thousand degrees Fahrenheit and the pressure at the
point of release, thirty to forty pounds per square inch, gauge pressure.
A two cylinder Otto cycle engine would exhaust once each revolution.
The idea has arisen to place a third trunk cylinder between the two Otto
cylinders, acting on the same shaft, with its crank at one hundred and
eighty degrees from the other two cranks, and connected to the Otto
cylinders by short ports,—this cylinder to expand the exhaust gases of
the Otto cylinders, at the same time making a more uniform crank effort,
each stroke of the engine being a working stroke. The value of this
idea can be illustrated by its application to a two cylinder Westinghouse
engine of which we have the data.
This engine had two, twelve by fourteen inch cylinders, made two
hundred and fifty revolutions per minute, and developed eighty-two indi-
cated horse power on eighteen cubic feet of six hundred and fifty B. T. U.
gas per horse power hour. The temperature of the exhaust gases, accord-
ing to the computation, was eleven hundred degrees Fahrenheit and the
pressure, thirty pounds per square inch gauge pressure. This gas on ex-
panding to atmospheric pressure by an adiabatic expansion would yield
about sixteen indicated horse power. This is not half the energy contained


in the exhaust gases for the temperature at atmospheric pressure would
still be very high (some 800 degrees F.). Moreover this was figured as
adiabatic expansion, i. e., no loss of heat to the cylinder walls, and we
could not get this condition. The actual card of a gas engine usually
shows about half of the work of the ideal card with adiabatic expansion,
(See appendix) and although the temperature in a low pressure cylinder
would not be as high as in an ordinary gas engine cylinder, we would
still have considerable loss of heat and our horse power would fall con-
siderably below that figured by adiabatic expansion. Ten to twelve indi-
cated horse power would be a very liberal estimate.
This would not go far toward equalizing our crank effort and would
not be much of a gain in economy, when the extra cost, extra complexity
of the machine, extra attendance necessary, and extra losses at small loads
are taken into consideration. If a compound engine is to be a success
the pressure of the exhaust must be increased.
We will see how this can be done:
Let H = total heat supplied to the machine per stroke.
M = weight of mixture taken per stroke.
Kv = specific heat of mixture at constant volume,
y = ratio of specific heat of constant pressure to that of constant
volume.
T s= temperature of gases, absolute scale.
P= absolute pressure of the gases.
V = volume of the gases.
V&gt;
C = — = the ratio of compression.
V,
R = the difference in the specific heats or the constant in the
equation P V = M R T.
The subscripts x, 2, 3, 4, and 5 refer when applied to T, P, or V, to
the temperature pressure or volume at the point I, a, 3, 4, or 5 respec-
tively (see Fig. 1).

The P« is increased by an increase in Pi, an increase in H/M, a de-
crease in Kv , a decrease in T\, or a decrease in C. H/M depends on
the mixture of the gas, which is fixed within very narrow limits by other
considerations. Kv is practically fixed. It is at least not under our
control. Ti could be easily raised but it would be a very difficult prob-
lem to lower it. C can be varied at our pleasure, as it is merely the


ratio of compression. The larger the compression volume, the greater is
the surface in contact with the hot gases at the explosion temperatures.
The thermodynamic efficiency of our cycle also depends on the value of
C (see appendix). Our efficiency decreases as C decreases.
If we could afford to equalize the crank effort at the expense of the
efficiency, we could accomplish it by decreasing C, but our gain in effi-
ciency by compounding was very slight and with the increased complexity
of the machine, etc., it would be out of the question to attempt to equalize
crank effort at the expense of economy.
The only quantity left to vary in equation (6) is Pi. According to
equation (6), P» varies as Pi, according to equation (5); P« varies as
Pi, according to equation (3), Pa varies as P- which varies as Pi. In
fact it is easily shown (see appendix) that the pressure at ANY point,
the amount of mixture admitted per stroke, the amount of heat supplied
per stroke and the work done per stroke all vary as Pi. Increasing Pi
would have several good effects. It might make it profitable to expand
from P* to atmosphere, it would increase the capacity of the machine,
and it would to some extent decrease the percentage of heat lost to
the jacket (see appendix).
On the other hand an increase in Pi is a difficult thing to obtain. We
are limited in the amount we can increase it by the maximum pressure
in the cylinder (P»); which would increase in the same ratio. The value
of Pj in ordinary practice is in the neighborhood of three hundred pounds.
We can design a cylinder to work at five hundred pounds and not give
trouble. The principle trouble would be the volume of air to be com-
pressed and the increased complexity and number of parts. This would
probably prove fatal to the commercial success of the machine.
There are other cycles, than the Otto, which might be compounded—
those which ignite at constant pressure instead of constant volume. The
Diesel Motor belongs to this class. Of these, those which compress in a
cylinder separate from the working cylinder, may have the working cylin-
der designed to expand to any extent desired and would not profit by
compounding, but those which compress the air in the working cylinder
and then admit and burn the gas at constant pressure, can only expand
to the original volume of the air. In these engines, like those employing
the Otto cycle, the pressure at release is from thirty to forty pounds per
square inch, gauge pressure. And as in the former case it would not pay
to encumber our machine with an other cylinder, unless the pressure
at release can be raised and the works of the two cylinders be made
nearer equal.
We will investigate this case.—Let the same letters be raised to de-

M equaling the weight of air in the cylinder during compres-
sion. And since the weight of fuel admitted is small as compared with
the weight of air we will suppose its equation to be the same, that is
P V = M R T.

In this expression an increase in H/M, Pi, or X, or a decrease in
C, Kp or Ti increases P«.
As to an increase in Pi the same discussion will apply here as in the
former case of the Otto cycle.
H/M is the heat of combustion per unit weight of air in the cylinder
and is limited by the amount of heat the given weight of air will generate
when the oxygen is completely burned. This limit does not vary 20% in
the extreme cases of our ordinary gaseous fuels. However all of the
oxygen of the air cannot be burned and we reach a practical limit when
we have burned as much fuel as we can and still have complete combus-
tion. The ordinary gas engine is designed to approach this limit as nearly
as possible at full load, so that there is left no room for further increas-
ing it
X, the weight of fuel admitted to the cylinder, can obviously not be
increased.
For the same reasons as were given in the discussion of the Otto
cycle, the quantities Kp , C and Ti cannot be decreased to any extent.
There is then no satisfactory way in which the ideal cycle can be
changed so as to raise the pressure at release. There remains but one
possibility. Inasmuch as the pressure in our actual cycle is less than that
of the ideal, there is a possibility that we may approach more nearly the
ideal cycle. The principal causes of this difference are, throttling during
admission, the heating of the gases by the hot ports and cylinder walls
during admission and compression, incomplete combustion, and the rapid
loss of heat to the cylinder walls during expansion. Suffice it to say that
these are well known faults and are fought against by our best gas engine
builders.


It seems that, at the present state of prices and of development of
the gas engine ,a compound engine is impractical. Even if we could raise
the pressure at release sufficiently to make a second cylinder pay at full
load, it would be detrimental at lesser loads; for, no matter whether the
engine governs by missing explosions or by throttling (or by cutting off
the admission of fuel in the case of ignition at constant pressure) in the
one case the machine runs idle part of the time and in the other the pres-
sure would be reduced too much for a second cylinder to pay. So to the
individual who contemplates the compounding of the gas engine, we
may say; that it is not probable that his efforts will be crowned with any
very great amount of success.
APPENDIX.
Increasing Pi Would, To Some Extent, Decrease The Percentage Of
Heat Loss To The Jacket.
For, while the amount of gas in the cylinder and the heat expended
per stroke are increased due to an increase in Pi, the temperatures are not
increased on that account Since the amount of heat transmitted to the
jacket depends on the temperatures it would not be increased on that
account. However, due to the decrease of the percentage of heat lost
to the jacket, the temperatures in the cylinder are increased, and there-
fore, the amount of heat lost to the jacket is increased, but the per-
centage of heat lost must be decreased to accomplish this.
The Actual Card About Half The Ideal.
The truth of this statement is illustrated by the two cylinder Westing-
house engine which we have referred to once before.
The card shows that,—
POUNDS POUNDS
GAUGE ABSOLUTE
The pressure at compression 80 = 95
The pressure at explosion joo = 315
, The pressure at release 3° == 45
From adiabatic tables the temperature of a gas on being compressed
from atmospheric conditions to a pressure of 95 pounds is 890 degrees
absolute and the ratio of volumes .265.
The volume of the piston displacement of a 12* x 14" engine is, .916
cubic feet. From the volume of the piston displacement and the ratio
of volume, the total cylinder volume is 1.244 cubic feet
Taking the weight of one cubic foot of gas at atmospheric pressure
and 60 degrees Fahrenheit to be .0763 pound, and the specific heat of


constant volume to be .1689 B. T. U., the heat required to raise the tem-
perature of the cylinder one degree is
1.244 X .0763 X 1689 — .016 B. T. U.
The heat supplied being 18 cu. ft. of 650 B. T. U. gas per horse power
hour and the engine making 82 horse power the heat supplied per cycle
would be (260 cycle per minute)
18 X 650 X 82
= 61.5 B. T. U. per stroke.
260 X 60
This would raise the temperature of the cylinder
61.5
= 3,800 degrees—rise in temperature.
.016
The absolute temperature of the cylinder would then be
3,800 + 890 = 4,700 degrees.
The pressure corresponding to this temperature would be
4700
X 95 = 500 pounds.
800
This is the theoretical absolute pressure of explosion.
By the adiabatic law the pressure at release would be 78 pounds ab-
solute. The ordinate of the card at explosion would be the difference
between the pressure at explosion and at compression, and the ordinate
at release would be the difference between the ordinate at release and
that of atmosphere. This completes Table I which compares the actual
with the ideal pressures.
The ideal efficiency of this cycle is 1—Tj/T,. (This formula can be
found in almost any book on gas engines). According to this the ideal
efficiency of this engine would be I—520/890=42%. The actual, as fig-
ured from the fact that it used 18 cu. ft. of 650 B. T. U. gas peT I. H.

Thermodynamic Efficiency Depends On Value Of C.
The heat supplied to the cycle is

The heat discharged is
- Kp (T6 - T.)
The efficiency is

The heat supplied may be taken as constant, then T.—Tt is fixed. Ti


is also fixed and the only variable is TV From the adiabatic law we have

From (7) our efficiency decreases as T« increases, and from (8) T.
increases as C decreases. Therefore our efficiency decreases as C de-
creases.
(a) The Pressure At Any Point, (b) The Amount Of Mixture Ad-
mitted Per Stroke, (c) Tke Amount Of Heat Supplied Per

All Vary As Pi
(a) We have already shown that P., Pa and P. vary as P..
But from the adiabatic law P = Po — where P and V are pressure
V
and volume at one point, and Po and Vo those at any other Then if
the pressure corresponding to any volume be increased, that corresponding
to any other volume is increased in the same ratio. And as we have shown
for one point on each adiabatic of our card, that the pressure varies as
Pi, it follows that the pressure corresponding to any other volume varies
in the same way.
(b) The equation of the gas is, PV=MRT. Hence M=PV/RT
which shows that the weight of the gas varies as the pressure that is
as Pi. The volume of the cylinder and the temperature of the gas at
admission of course remains the same.
(c) Since the heat is supplied by the mixture and the mixture being
homogeneous the heat supplied is proportional to the amount of mixture
which varies as Pi.
(d) According to (a) every ordinate of the card is increased direct-
ly as Ps. And as work is pressure times the volume swept through, and
the volumes are not altered, the work varies as the pressure which varies
as P,.

POWER AND CAPACITY.
The amount of fuel which can be burned on a given grate in a given
time depends upon the- draft or upon the quantity of air which is forced
to pass through the fuel. It is the function of a chimney primarily to
create this draft, or furnish this supply of air for the proper combustion
of the fuel and secondarily to convey the smoke and obnoxious products
of combustion high enough above the ground to render them compara-
tively inoffensive.
The difference in weight of the column of hot gases in the chimney
and that of a column of outside air of the same dimensions is the force
that produces draft. In other words, draft is the rise of the hotter
because lighter inside air and the fall of the colder because heavier out-
side air to take its place. The action, freed from all frictional resistances,
is a gravitational one. It is evident therefore that the interdependent rela-
tions, density, temperature and volume, are elements of the problem, as
are also their functions, the velocity of the current in the chimney and the
pressure as well as the head producing that current.
One pound of carbon for its perfect combustion requires theoretically
2.2-3 pounds of oxygen, or about 12 lbs. of air. It is found, however, in
practice, that more air is required for the perfect combustion of coal and
it is usual to assume 18 lbs. of air per lb. of coal with forced draft and
24 lbs. with chimney draft. The volume of the chimney gases may be
considered without appreciable error as equal to the volume of air at the
same temperature; inasmuch as the predominant constituent of fuel, C,
unites with the O of the air to form COj, which has the same volume
as the O from which it is formed; and the free II is so small a propor-
tion of the fuel that the increase in volume due to the steam is negligible.
The volume of a pound of air at 320 F. may be taken approximately at
12^2 cu. ft. A pound of fuel will then require theoretically for its com-
bustion 12X12.5=150 cu. ft. of air at 32°F=V., or practically, 24X125=
300 cu. ft. of air at 32°F=V„.

The assumptions arc:
That the volume of hot gases in the chimney equals the volume of
air at the same temperature.
That the temperature of the gases in the chimney is uniform.
That the density of the gases in the chimney is uniform and is
greater than the density of air, at the same temperature in the ratio of
25 to 24.
That the head producing draught in the chimney is, in the words of
Prof. DeVolson Wood, "such a height of hot gases as if added to the
column of gases in a chimney would produce the same pressure at the
furnace as a column of outside air, of the same area of base and a height
equal to that of the chimney."
That all frictional and other resistances equal zero.
RESISTANCE TO DRAFT.
Various resistances are encountered which greatly reduce the effective
head, producing draft in a chimney, and tend to cut down the velocity
of the current in the stack.
These resistances to draft may be enumerated as follows:
1st. The resistance offered by the grate and fuel bed.
2nd. The resistance due to the boiler tubes.
3rd. The resistance due to friction in the flue and chimney.
According to Rankine, the throttling at the grate is sufficient under
average conditions to cause a loss of head equal to threefourths of the
whole draft of the chimney.
The resistance due to the boiler tubes, says Prof. Gale, "is sometimes
(for small tubes) larger than that of the grate, but is usually less." "In
example of what may be taken to be good and common practice," says
Prof. R. H. Thurston, "the rate of flow in the flue is found to be from
one-half to one-seventeenth the acceleration due to the head, which means
that the resistances in the boiler approached three-fourths the total, as
a minimum, and attained above 09% in some cases. The usual proportion
seems to be about one-eighth the rate of acceleration or over 08% of total
resistance at the boiler." He says further, that experiment shows the loss
of head due to anthracite coal weighing on the grate 55 lbs. per cu. ft., is
not far from 0.3 inch of water, or approximately 36 feet of hot gases in
chimney. Meier says, "The frictions in furnace and boiler are found to
run from 0.4 to 0.6 inch." Or approximately 48 to 72 ft. of hot gases in
the chimney.
The resistance due to friction in the stack, or the P of Prof. Gale's
formula for draught pressure, is usually small in amount and it is cus-
tomary to estimate it according to the laws of hydraulics. Weisbach gives


it as about 5%. Prof. Gale says, "In most cases in which I have made
measurements of velocities and pressure in existing plants, more than
fifteen-sixteenths of the total draft has been expended in overcoming
frictional resistances, and less than one-sixteenth (or about 8%) in impart-
ing energy of motion to the gases."
Peclet followed by Weisbach and supported by Prof. Thurston uses, to
determine the head lost in friction in the flue and stack, the formula,
f In'
h, =
m 2g
f was estimated by Peclet at 0.012. Weisbach's form of the equation is
ln»
h = Z where Z = 0.034. He says, however, that for the sake of
d2g
safety, the value of Z should be doubled and makes Z = 0.05, which would
d
bring f equal to 0.012, since 111 = —
4
Prof. Gale in a series of experiments directly measured the co-efficient
of friction in the stack and found it to be "about 50% greater than the
value 'estimated' by Peclet for 'sooty surfaces' and quoted by Ran-
kine." It would seem therefore that f=o.oi6 should be a fair value in
most cases. This equation gives for the friction head in most chimneys,
according to Prof. Thurston "about 1-14 the resistance of the grate," a
quantity quite negligible in comparison with the other resistances. Weis-
bach assumed the remaining resistances in flues, grates, etc, equal to a
u«
loss of head h„ = Z, — where Z = 30. Therefore reducing this formula
to the Pahr. scale we get, a* = h — hi — h..

case, and usually not far from 2; ta is the absolute temperature represent-
ing the mean within the fire, which temperature is usually in common
practice probably not far from 2000° on the absolute Fahrenheit scale,
or, approximately, 1500° on the common scale, and sensibly constant."
Substituting the above value of G in the Rankine equation he gets

This equation was deduced as the result of a series of experiments con-
ducted at Cornell University in 1890 and the essential points brought out
by the experiments were as follows: "(1) That the resistances and
pressure differences in the chimney are lower than those computed from


the -temperature variations by the usual methods; (2) that the delivery
is greater with a given resistance, than is thus computed; (3) that the
temperature of maximum delivery is a variable quantity; (4) that the
chimney-temperature of maximum delivery is far above that ordinarily
taken as that of good practice in the operation of the steam boiler."

&lt;l(°*'i-')
This will be a maximum for ti=2 1-12 t&gt;, or the best chimney draft
takes place when the absolute temperature of the gases in the chimney
is to that of the external air as 25 to 12 or when the temperature of the
flue gases is in the neighborhood of 6oo° F. When this condition is ful-
filled, the preceding equation gives h=H and the density of the hot gases
is one-half that of the external air.
As a mathematical discussion the above is correct; and it appears
reasonable that in a chimney of given dimensions the head and conse-
quently the velocity and the quantity of gas discharge, or the "flow of
weight," as Mr. Brownlee defines it, increases with the internal tempera-
ture. But it does not do so to an unlimited extent for while the draft
power is increasing, the volume of air in the chimney is increasing and
there comes a point where the increase in volume counterbalances the
increase in velocity. Beyond this point there is a diminution in the
discharge.
Mr. Thomas Box says that, "the maximum effect is attained when
the volume of the internal air is between three and four times that of
the external air If we admit 3V£ as the relative
volume, the temperature would be about 1300 degrees." In 1889 Prof.
H. B. Gale concluded after many experiments that, "The ordinary values


of the temperature of maximum draught would range from one thousand
to two thousand degrees on the common Fahrenheit scale." In 1890 Prof.
R. H. Thurston arrived at the conclusion, from the afore mentioned
experiments at Cornell, that "both the facts of experiments and the
deductions of our theory confirm the proposition that the maximum
draught in the sense in which the term is used (that of maximum delivery,
not of maximum intensity) ordinarily, if not invariably, occurs at a
temperature far above that previously supposed; that maximum rising
as the resistance at the grate increases and as the resistance in the stack
decreases. It is probably rarely found at temperatures less than 700° or
8oo° or very probably i,ooo° Fahr." And again "No maximum draught
is likely to be approached at any temperatures occuring in the chimney,
the actual maxima falling more commonly at points on the scale between
800° and 2,000° Fahr." In 1892 Mr. W. E. Crane, recording observations
made on 12 different chimneys, concludes, "The temperature from casting
furnaces may be taken as from 700° to 8oo° and annealing furnaces
at 700°."
The first method of reasoning assumes the coefficient G or the measure
of the fuel bed resistance as a constant, whereas experiment has shown
that it is a variable of wide range and value, changing continually with
a slight variation in the condition of the fire. Prof. Wood admits, "if G
be a variable, the maximum cannot be found unless it be a known function
of the temperature."
It, therefore, seems quite well established that the maximum draft
is not reached at a temperature of 600° F. although it is none the less
true that the temperature of the stack in practice should rarely ever be
allowed to exceed that temperature. Mr. Meier gives in Helios an excel-
lent illustration of the fact that the capacity or power of a stack can be
increased by nearly 50% by raising the temperature of the gases from
500* to 900°. But it is done at a great loss of heat and consequently
the cost is considerable. The same increase in draft may be had by
adding to the height of the chimney. In practice the temperature of the
chimney gases should approach as nearly as possible the temperature of
the water in the boiler and so long as the draft is sufficient to burn the
required amount of fuel in the furnace, the temperature may be reduced
to 400° or even 300° with profit, the heat being given to an economizer,
or put to some other use. It is, moreover, to be observed, that the draft
power approaches and recedes from the maximum slowly, so that "by
raising the temperature of the flue," according to Mr. Eugene Kidder,
"from 6oo* to 1200° we would increase the draught less than twenty per
cent, while the waste in heat would be very considerable." Conversely,
a large reduction in temperature produces a small decrease in draft power.


APPROXIMATE FORMULAE.
It was shown that when the density of the hot gases is one-
half that of the external air, or when the temperature of the gases
in the chimney is approximately 600° F, h=H. Therefore H may be
substituted for h in the above empirical formulae for velocity, and pro-
vided 1 and m, or 1 and d, have a known relationship, the formulae may
be reduced to the form
u = C /a g h = C y/2 g H = C» v/H
which will agree fairly well with the conditions of practice.
Therefore let T, == 6o° or t, = 5210
and h = H
then T, = 6240 or t, = 1085°
let also 1 = H
H
The ratio —=30 is adopted by D. K. Clark as common in English
d
practice, although an examination of many English chimneys shows this
to be often exceeded sometimes reaching as high as 40. Many Engineers
H
use the ratio —=25 and in the more modern American practice it
d
approaches close to 20. Therefore making these substitutions in the above
formulas we get the following table for actual velocities, u, of the hot
gases issuing from the chimney.

To quote Mr. George H. Babcock, "This whole question of efficiency
of chimneys is not amenable to exact analysis." The methods of the
designing engineer "are and must remain for some time empirical and
his guide must be current successful practice. It is this idea which has
led to the very general adoption of simple approximate formulae.

commercial horse power by allowing 5 lbs. of coal per HP hour. HP-
2.4 A VH. There are several formulae of this type that have been in
use for many years. A rule given by Tredgold is possibly as old as any.
It is: "The area of a chimney in inches for a low-pressure steam engine,
when above ten horse power should be 112 times the horse power of the
engine, divided by the square root of the height of the chimney in feet."
In Nystroms Mechanics may be found the equation HP=i,45 A VH.

VH
to F=7.8i3A VH.
D. K. Clark uses F=i6AVH.
F
Geipel and Kilgour have a= where a is the effective area in
17VH
square feet.
They also give another form of the same: F=ri7(A—KVA)VH
where K is a quantity varying from 0.5 to 0.66. This formula is quite
similar to an equation given by William Kent. In both the actual area
of the flue is reduced, to account for friction, by an amount equal to two
inches all around the perimeter and the resulting area is called the
effective area.
Mr. Kent's equation is Commercial HP 3-33(A—0.6VA) VH=3.33aVH
or F=i6.65(A—o.6VA)VH=i6.65aVH.
This formula has been very generally adopted in the trade journals
and has been found to give excellent results in practice. Mr. Meier points
out that, "Kent's formula has the advantage of recognizing the practical
fact for larger powers the area of chimney required per horse power
becomes less." Prof. C. A. Smith gives
A
F = ,/H = 12.12 A V'H.
0.0825
This corresponds almost exactly with the equation derived above, and it
has met with very general use.
Prof. M. E. Cooley gives the rule: One hundred pounds of coal will
be consumed for each square foot in sectional area of a chimney one hun-
dred feet high. This amounts to the equation F=ioAVH which is
seen to give somewhat smaller results than some of the preceding
equations.
However, it may be used safely in designing where it is often desir-
able to build a chimney a little larger than present needs acquire. The
equation F=wA VH will be found to agree closely with the general
equation given by Rankine and may be used to And the probable capacity
of a given chimney.
HEIGHT OF CHIMNEY.
The above formulae have been criticised in that they make no dis-
tinction between a chimney 81 feet high and 2 feet sq. inside, and one
16 feet high and 3 ft. square inside. The product AVH is the same
in either case. It is well known that the lower chimney will not have
the power of the higher. It seems possible, however, to overcome this


objection by establishing minimum heights for chimneys, as determined
by successful practice.
It has been shown that the draft pressure of a chimney
is directly proportional to the height. If, therefore, the height of a chim-
ney is sufficient to give a proper draft, with economical temperature of
gases, for the combustion of a given kind of fuel, there can usually be
no advantage in building it higher. To cause complete combustion, the
air must be brought into close contact with the fuel. The frictional
resistance of a bed of fuel increases with a decrease in the size of the
piece. Hence, although finely broken fuel presents more surface to the
oxidizing effect of the air and allows as a consequence, more perfect com-
bustion a more intense draft and consequently a higher chimney is
required. Gas and oil require a small draft and may be burned with
a low chimney. A sharper draft is required for sawdust or tanbark than
for cordwood, for slack or screenings than for egg or nut coal. Engineers
have heretofore come to a fairly good agreement as to the necessary
heights of chimneys under different conditions.
The Messrs. Bancroft say, "It is also found that with a lower exhaus-
tion than a 1-2 inch water pressure it is difficult to keep a good fire with-
out constant stirring, which is wasteful and productive of smoke." One-
half inch corresponds to a height of about 70 feet.
Messrs. Geipel and Kilgour say, "Generally speaking, chimneys should
be at least one hundred feet high, if inferior coal is to be used."
Mr. William Kent says, "Chimneys above 150 feet in height are very
costly, and their increased cost is rarely justified by the increased
efficiency."
Mr. Babcock, of Babcock and Wilcox Co., says, "To burn anthracite
slack to advantage, a draught of iJ4 inches of water is necessary, which
can be attained by a well proportioned chimney 175 feet high."
Mr. E. D. Meier, of the Heine Co., says, "If bituminous slack is to
be used the chimney should not be less than 100 feet high and not less
than 125 feet high for anthracite pea, or 150 feet for anthracite buck-
wheat"
We may, therefore, decide from the best English and American
practice that from 80 to 100 feet is the minimum height for the best coal,
and that from 150 to 200 feet is necessary for the poorest coal. If there
are long connecting flues to the chimney, it may. be necessary to slightly
increase these heights. Moreover, local considerations, as surrounding
hills or buildings, may tend to interfere with the draft and demand higher
chimneys. If the products of combustion are of a particularly obnoxious
character, it may be necessary to carry them to a greater height than
would be required for draft.


AREA OF CHIMNEY.
Having determined upon the height of a chimney, the area may be
found from the above formulae, subject to the following conditions: that
where several boilers are added to a chimney, less relative area is required
than for one. Messrs. Bancroft, D. K. Clark and many others testify
to the fact that as additional boilers have been attached to chimneys,
their draft has been improved. As the boilers arc usually fired success-
ively, the chimney has to overcome the friction of a fresh fuel bed in
but one of them at a time. This consideration leads Mr. Meier to say
that, "It will be safe to figure 75 per cent (additional area) for the sec-
ond (boiler) and 50 per cent each for the third, fourth, etc. But it is
advisable to increase the height slightly for each boiler added." A com-
mon rule is to make the area of the chimney 1-8 the area of the grate.
Prof. Gale presents formula; somewhat different from the above and
having the possible advantage that the height and area are independent of
each other.
A = 0.07 F*
Tl\G /
where Ti is the temperature of the stack on the ordinary Fahr. scale,
and G is the area of the grate. The height is made to depend upon the
temperature of the stack and the rate of combustion. Mr. Meier adopts
Prof. Gale's formula for height, changing the constant to 120, and Mr.
Kent's formula for area.
120 yF \ * 0.06 F
"tTVg/ "'v/h"
As will be seen from these formula:, an increase in the rate of com-
bustion and consequent decrease of grate area points to higher chimneys.
This seems to represent the tendencies of the more recent practice. Prof.
Thurston's rule ," Substract 1 from twice the square root of the height
and the result is the rate of combustion in lbs. per sq. ft. of grate per
hr. for anthracite," will be found to give results in quite close agreement
with those derived from Prof. Gale's formula.
BEST SHAPE OK FLUE.
The best shape of the chimney flue is a question that has caused
much discussion. Theoretically the cross-section should be circular to
offer the least resistance, but this resistance is so small a part of the
total resistance that it must not be the deciding factor. Considerations


of economy of material are far more important and point to a circular
flue as the best form. This form moreover presents less surface for radia-
tion of heat and for infiltration of air through the walls, in the case of
brick chimneys. Opinion is widely varying as to whether the flue should
be vertical or tapering, larger at the top or at the bottom.
While it is theoretically true that the gases in a chimney expand
adiabatically, because of the decrease of pressure, it is also probable that
the cooling of the gases and other causes tend, if not to entirely counter-
act this effect, to at least render it of small consequence. Moreover, a
possible reduction in velocity due to enlarge section might afford greater
opportunity for the draft to be interfered with by the wind. Therefore,
in view of the little if any advantage afforded by tapering the flue in
either direction, it is probable that ease in construction will decide in
favor of a straght cylindrical flue. This seems also to ac-.ord with the
most recent American practice.


OFFICIAL REPORT OF GRANDSTAND COLLAPSE
ON FERRY FIELD.
Ann Arbor, Mich., Nov. 28, 1905.
Professor M. E. Cooley,
Dean of the Department of Engineering,
University of Michigan.
My Dear Professor Cooley:
In accordance with your wish that some record be made of the causes
of the failure of the grandstand at the Wisconsin-Michigan game on
November i8th, I have prepared a brief report on the subject which I
have the honor to hand you herewith.
One point, which is not mentioned in the report, seems to me of
some importance. On the Monday after the game I telephoned to Mr.
Baird to know if there were any plans or drawings of the stand which
collapsed. He told me there were not. Although the practice of allowing
such structures to be built by a carpenter, without preliminary plans, is
common enough, it seems to me dangerous. A well made plan not only
facilitates the erection very materially but it simplifies inspection, and
reduces the danger from poor design to a minimum. It is easier to pick
out flaws in a design from a drawing than by a hasty inspection of the
finished structure. I would respectfully recommend that no structure
of such importance as the one under consideration be built until plans
for the same have been prepared and approved by competent authorities.
Very respectfully yours,
(Signed) C. J. Tilden.
THE GRANDSTAND COLLAPSE
The structure which collapsed on Ferry Field on the afternoon of
November 18th, 1905, was what is known as a "standing bleacher," built
entirely of wood, approximately 40 feet wide by 200 feet long, and sit-
uated at the west end of the football field. The upper sloping surface
was built in forty steps, n 54" tread by 354" rise, the lowest step being
about 18" from the ground and the highest about 12 feet. The con-
struction of the bleacher is shown in Fig. I, which is drawn from meas-
urements made on the similar stand at the east end of the field. The
flooring, of 2*xio" planking, was carried on triangular frames, each frame
consisting of six posts from 2 feet to 12 feet high and spaced about 6'A
feet apart, a top chord of 2"xl2" plank halved into the tops of the posts
and spiked firmly to them, and diagonal bracing of 2*x6" scantling. The
longest posts (12 feet) were 4"x6", the others 4*x4". Each frame con-
sisted of two parts: an old structure about 14 feet wide with a maximum


■fMJU
■/ *v

breeeeef


height of about s feet, and a new portion built especially for this game,
attached to the old part and running back to the full height of 12 feet
The junction between the old portion and the new at the top chord was
made by overlapping the ends of the 2"x 12" stringers for a foot or more
and bolting firmly with two ^2-inch bolts. (Fig. 3.) These frames were
set east and west, and were spaced approximately SJ4 feet center to center
north and south. The only connection between the old portion and the
new occurred at the top chord junction described above and illustrated in
Figure 3. There were no intermediate stringers so that the 2"x 10" plank-
ing which covered the top of the structure had a clear span of nearly
S'A feet. Figure 2 shows details of the lower end of inclined stringers.
The stand filled up with people rapidly and there were probably in the
neighborhood of 3,000 persons, mostly men and boys, on the stand at
the time the game began. The collapse took place shortly after the open-
ing of play at the beginning of the second half. To the spectators on the
bleachers at the sides of the field the appearance was that of the whole
structure sliding slowly forward so that the mass of people was forced
gently towards the heavy wire fence which closed in the field at the west
end. There was little or no appearance of disorder and few cries or
screams, the whole affair appearing to be quite lacking in the ordinary
elements of a panic After the structure had collapsed the crowd was
densely packed, and jammed hard against the wire fence above mentioned.
The substitute players ran to the assistance of the crowd, and by pulling
up bodily the heavy posts which carried the wire fence, relieved the pres-
sure of the throng by allowing the people to enter the field and take
positions on the grass at the side lines.
On Sunday morning, November 19th, I made a critical examination
of the structure with a view to determining, if possible, the causes of the
failure. The stand had collapsed apparently by side-wise motion of the
lower parts of the frames towards the north, the whole structure folding
over in that direction like a pack of cards. The first eight or ten rows
or steps were flattened down on the ground with but little lack of con-
tinuity in the flooring. At about the middle of the framework between
the old portion and the new, the stringers were broken and torn, the
break occurring in this panel in every instance. The old stand collapsed
to the north, as described above, while the new portion held firm until
the strain on the connecting 2"x 12" stringers became too great, and
failure occurred by the tearing and splitting of these stringers. In nearly
every case the bolted joint above described, between the top chord of the
new structure, and that of the old, was intact. In one or two cases the
plank had split through the bolt hole, tearing the timber away from the
bolt; this, however, was observed but rarely, and in no case was a bolt
injured. That part of the framework west of the panel in which the
break occurred, i. e., the new portion, was not seriously injured, except


for a leaning of the posts towards the east, and north, and in most cases
a parting of the stringer from -the top of the rear post, caused by the pull
on the stringers when the forward part of the structure went down. The
flooring of the new portion was practically destroyed, and it was observed
that the planks forming this flooring, which were laid continuously across
from one to three frames, were nailed with but one spike into each
stringer that they crossed. There was consequently little or no lateral
stiffness afforded to the stringers by the floor planks.
During the intermission between the first and second halves there
had been considerable movement in the crowd on the stand:—stamping
of feet, swinging of arms, etc., on account of the cold. From the stories
told by those on the stand it appears that creaking timbers, general set-
tling of the structure, and sounds like nails pulling out, gave warning
some fifteen or twenty minutes beforehand that the stand was unsafe.
The collapse occurred, as above stated, just after the intermission.
An examination of the mud-sills or footings under the posts of the
old part of the stand revealed some interesting facts in regard to the
supports for the lower ends of these posts. At the toe of the bleacher,
that is, the end nearest the field, the stringers came down and rested on
a continuous plank; the ends of the stringers being bevelled for a distance
varying from 2 to 6 inches to give bearing upon the sill, as shown in
Figure 2. There was nothing to support the stringers vertically until the
first post, some 7 feet west was reached, where the plank was halved into
the top of the post and spiked. Under this first row of posts, and also
under the second row, there was apparently no continuous sill. In one
case the post had been set on a piece of 2" x 12" plank just one foot in
length, and apparently not in the center of that. The grain of this plank
ran north and south and it had split at about its middle, whereupon the
north ends were forced into the soft ground some four inches. (See
Figure 4.) This must, of course, have occurred before the structure
collapsed. In a number of other instances a similar condition of affairs
was noticed, sometimes the sill being much less adequate than in the
case cited. In several instances a piece of 6" x 1" fencing, perhaps 18
inches long, was all that transmitted the weight from the post to the
ground. In the particular case of the 2 inch plank sill, above mentioned,
the burying of the north end as described, would cause considerable
tilting of the structure towards the north. In the first row of posts, 2
feet high, there was no longitudinal (i. e., north and south) bracing, so
that the failure of this sill, as above described, would not be met by any
support tending to hold the structure in place. The tendency to failure
toward the north would be accentuated by the eccentricity of the con-
nection of the new stringer to the old, as shown by Figure 3, the resultant
load from the two stringers coming on the post at its outer edge, instead
of the center. This eccentric loading, however, occurred in the third

row of posts, which were braced longitudinally, and therefore stiffened
against collapse, although the mudsills were non-continuous and generally
unsatisfactory in this row as in the first and second rows.
In the new portion of the stand the sills were long planks, for the
most part continuing under the ends of two or three posts, and there
was practically no sign of settlement. The bottoms of the posts were
nailed into the mud sills, and sometimes these nails held even under the
violent wrenching which the collapse of the old structure brought upon the
new. All connections, except those of the new stringers to the old where
the splice was made by Vt. inch bolts as above described, were spiked
with heavy wire nails. The posts were observed without exception to be
all right. Even the halved joint at the top to receive the stringer does
not seem to have weakened the strut.
The stand at the east end of the field, in all respects like that at the
west end, carried approximately the same load throughout the game.
An examination of that structure on Sunday morning, directly after
looking over the remains of the bleacher at the west end, re-
vealed a conditon of affairs quite as bad as at the west end, and apparently
only a providential difference in the method of loading, or the amount,
or the possible fact that the ground was harder and firmer at this end
of the field, prevented a similar collapse occurring at this bleacher. The
mud sills under the old part are but the poorest apologies for sills, and
utterly inadequate to transmit the load safely from the post to the ground.
In one observed case a post in the first row from the toe of the bleacher,
that is a post only two feet high, having the stringer notched into its
upper end, was two inches out of plumb, leaning towards the south, as
shown in Figure 5.
It is my opinion that the failure was due primarily to the faulty
foundations under the old structure,—that is, the wholly inadequate mud
sills under the posts. These sank into the soft ground when the load
was brought on the structure, causing a distortion which the longitudinal
bracing was unable to prevent. If every row of posts had been thorough-
ly cross-braced longitudinally, or if the stringers forming the top chords
of the cross-frames had been "bridged," or otherwise supported against
lateral failure, the stand would have been amply able to carry its load.
The first row of posts, however, was left unbraced, the 2" x 12" stringers
were therefore without adequate lateral support in a distance of some 13
feet, and these two deficiencies, combined with the much more serious
one of faulty foundations, caused the stand to collapse in the manner
noted. It is but fair to say that the fault was entirely in the old portion
of the stand, and that the new portion appeared to be sound and substan-
tial in every particular. (Signed) C. J. Tiwsn.

ADDENDA.
The present board of editors of the 1906 Technic take pleasure in
presenting VoL 19, No. I. Whether it is up to standard or not we will
leave to the reader to judge, suffice it to say it has been an honest effort
to produce something of interest and value to both graduates and under-
graduates.
No particular new features have been added except perhaps the cover
design which is a tracing taken from a photograph of the entrance to the
Arcade. It is the intention to publish in the next issue a short biography
of four of our prominent alumni and it is the desire of the board that this
policy be pursued by the coming editors. It will be of interest to everyone
to read a short account of the successes of these various men and how they
were achieved. •
It is the purpose to change The Technic from a semi-annual to a
quarterly, and in order to do this a subscription list will be necessary.
To obtain this we have mailed subscription blanks to all the graduates;
these are now being signed and returned very satisfactorily and we hope
to have a large list of subscribers which should increase year by year.
Otljcr engineering schools both large and small are doing this. Har-
vard has a quarterly of excellent proportions and material, the Rose
Polytechnic Institute produces a monthly, and these publications arc a
credit to their management and the loyalty of their supporters.
We wish to take this opportunity of expressing our kindest thanks
to those who have sent us their subscriptions and to those who have
advertised with us, as heretofore it has been the financial support of the
latter which has made The Michigan Technic a possibility.
Special thanks are due Dean M. E. Cooley for the kindly interest he
has always taken in the Engineering Society and its publication; to Pro-
fessors Williams, Sadler, Tilden and other members of the faculty and
old graduates for suggestions and material. Mr. Tinkham, through whose
efforts The Technic was made a semi-annual last year, has also kindly-
assisted.
For the sake of those few who may feel that advertising in The
Technic is not altogether profitable a few remarks may here be opportune.


The Technic this year will consist of two issues of 2,000 each (or
4,000 in all). These are sent to the graduate members of the University
Engineering Society and to th» subscribers, some of whom have been
out of college since the early seventies. Of the engineering societies with
which we exchange the following is a partial list of prominent ones:
The Michigan Society of Engineers, the Ohio Society of Surveyors and
Civil Engineers, the Illinois Engineering Society, the Indiana Engineering
Society, the Iowa Engineering Society, the Minnesota Engineering Society,
the Colorado Engineering Society. The members of these societies are
all prominent in their profession and hold positions of responsibility where
they either buy directly or are advised with in regard to the buying of
engineering material or appliances.
It is easily seen that none of this advertising is thrown away, it goes
directly to the people who are interested in it and only to them.
Following is a list of some of the most important acquisitions of the
Engineering Department the past semester:
A 200,000-pound testing machine, motor driven.
Apparatus for testing reinforced concrete.
Two weighing tanks each 600 cu. ft. capacity.
15" Centrifugal pump and 150 H. P. engine for hydraulic canal.
25 H. P. Olds gas engine in connection with 40 II. P. Pintsch gas
producer.
12" Turbine water wheel.
Tangential water wheel.
12 K. W. 250 volt generator to be attached to De Laval steam turbine.
30 K. W. A. C. generator.
Single phase 5 H. P. motor.
Constant current transformer.
Electric blue printing machine.
The electric blue printing machine is one of the most valuable posses-
sions and produces beautiful prints, a clock work mechanism operating it,
the weight of the lamp by virtue of its position furnishing the energy
similar to the weight in an old time clock. The time of passage of the
lamp before the print being regulated by raising or lowering weight on
the pendulum.
The old printing room under the roof of the shops has been super-


seded by the new one. It is bolted and barred and to obtain access to it
is quite as difficult as to enter the office of the head of the oil trust
The new machine is kept under 4ock#and key, but the key may easily
be obtained.
To the north of the boiler and power plant has been built this past
summer a blow off well designed by Professor Cooley. Instead of blowing
off the boilers to the atmosphere as heretofore, they are now blown into
this well. The steam strikes a cast-iron plate in the side of the well, the
water of condensation entering a settling basin where the mud and heavier
particles are separated from the water by falling to the bottom, the water
then passes through a filter consisting of several separate layers of marsh
hay, sand, gravel, and finally stones. The water, purified, passes into
a catch basin from where it is again returned to the boilers.
The naval tank is now filled with water, one week being spent in this
operation, raising the water level at the rate of two feet a day. Very
little leakage was discovered. The water will all be pumped out again,
the tank cleaned and then covered with a thin coat of neat cement to
prevent any possible small leaks.

The Chicago Improved Cube Concrete Mixer
The Best for Concrete Makers
"It Has No Insides"
It is a well known fact that mixers having inside blades pocket
and separate the material as it enters and again in turn scoop it
up from the bottom, and require constant attention by frequent
flushing, as also scraping and pounding at short intervals on the
outside of drum to dislodge the material which is constantly at-
taching itself to the inside mechanism, such as vanes, scoops,
paddle arms, inside shaft, or whatever it may be, not only caus-
ing the material to ball but greatly decreasing the life of the
machine, as these accessories, by reason of their resistance, not
only wear out rapidly but largely increase the strain on the
gears, frame, etc. Our CUBE MIXER, tvith ordinary use, is
guaranteed not to clog.

GEORGE YOUNG WISNER
Gardner S. Williams.
Among the graduates of the University of Michigan who have
achieved distinction in Hydraulics, no name stands higher than George
Young Wisner. He was born at West Dresden, New York, July nth,
1841. His mother, Jane Downey Wisner, was of Scotch descent, her
family being among the early settlers in Maryland. As to his ancestry
in the male line the record of the family Bible shows that among the
ragged troops whom Washington led in that gloomy Christmas night
march which culminated in the brilliant victory at Trenton, probably in
Haussegger's German Battalion which, guided by James Monroe and
William Washington, held the advance of Greene's column .and received
the first Hessian fire, there trudged two William Wisners, father and
son, the elder being one of the two Americans killed in that engagement,
the younger one of the six wounded. These were the great-grand-sire
and grand-sire of the subject of this sketch, whose father a third William


Wisner, while still a boy came with his parents from Louisburg, Penn-
sylvania, to New York in 1810. Young George spent his boyhood in the
wheat fields, among the lakes of Central New York, working on the farm
during the summer, and doing chores and attending district school two
miles away, in the winter. By the time he was sixteen his education
had so far progressed as to be beyond the curriculum of the district
school, and in 1857 he spent about four months at the Starkey Seminary,
Starkey, New York, following in 1858 and 1859 with about the same
length of time each year in the Private Seminary of N. W. Ayers at
Penn Yan. In i86r having taught a district school in the meantime, Mr.
Wisner, then in his twentieth year, decided to take up Civil Engineering,
and selected the University of Michigan, at that time the only institution
of its class whose doors were open at a tuition within reach of a far-
mer's boy, as the place for further preparation. His spare time until the
fall of 1862 was spent in fitting himself for entrance, and on arriving in
Ann Arbor at the opening of college, he was able to pass not only the
entrance requirements, but the entire freshman work as well, and was
admited to the class of '65, a full fledged sophomore without a condition.
He was actually in the University less than three-fourths of the time
during the remaining years of his course, but nevertheless satisfactorily
completed the work for his degree in higher astronomy under the fam-
ous Professor Watson, and the laboratory course in qualitative and quan-
titative chemical analysis. During his senior year he was assistant to the
professor of Civil Engineering, the late DeVolson Wood, and had charge
of the freshman class one hour each day, among his students being Pro-
fessor Joseph B. Davis. With the encouragement of Professor Wood
who extended to him the use of the University instruments, he engaged
in surveying in the neighborhood of Ann Arbor at such times as his
college duties permitted. The one condition which Professor Wood im-
posed upon him regarding this work was that the fees charged for his
work should be the same as those of the Professor for the same kind
of employment, and thus early in life he was taught to put a proper value
upon engineering service and never to underbid his professional breth-
ren. Upon graduation Mr. Wisner entered the employ of the Government
and for the next fifteen years was engaged on surveys, investigations,
and improvements to navigation on the Great Lakes and the Mississippi
River.
From 1880 to 1887 he served as superintendent of construction for
the 10th and nth Light House Districts, comprising the upper lakes, and
was engaged both for the Government and in private practice on improve-
ments of the Mississippi, Illinois, and DesPlaines Rivers and on railroad
location, at the close of this period being one of the active supporters of
the propostion to create a National Board of Public Works. From


1888 to 1891 he was Chief Engineer upon the reconstruction of the Eads
Jetties at the South Pass of the Mississippi Delta, when these important
structures were rebuilt and made permanent after plans prepared by him,
and under his supervision. During the same period he was Chief Engin-
eer of the Brazos River Harbor Improvement in Texas, where there was
developed under his direction a twenty foot channel, in spite of the fact
that a board of army engineers had reported it impossible to maintain
one of six feet. This work is described in the Transactions of the Amer-
ican Society of Civil Engineers, Vol. XXV. He was also consulting en-
gineer for the improvement of Tampico Harbor, Mexico, and Aransas
Pass, Texas.
In 1895, his home being in Detroit, he was asked to take charge of
and organize the newly created engineering department of the Board of
Health of that city. He accepted and occupied the position of Sanitary
Engineer until 1897, and established a system of sanitary building in-
spection, injecting into the work of the Board of Health much sound
engineering practice that has since borne fruit. In 1894 Mr. Wisner
first suggested the deepening of the Lake Erie harbors by raising the
level of the Lake with a dam at its outlet, and in 1897 he was appointed
a member of the United States Board of Engineers on Deep Water Ways
by President McKinley. His colleagues were Alfred Noble, C. E., of
the Class of '69, and Major, now General, Chas. W. Raymond, U. S. A.,
the latter being selected as chairman of the Board. The purpose of the
Commission was to study and report upon the various projects for a deep
water communication between the Great Lakes and the Atlantic Ocean,
and upon the improvement of navigation on Lake Erie by the plan sug-
gested by Mr. Wisner in 1894. Owing to the breaking out of the Spanish
War the attention of the Chairman was taken up almost wholly with the
defenses of Philadelphia and the Delaware River, and the other member
of the Commission, Mr. Noble, was sent to the West Indies on a special
mission to locate a coaling station for our Navy, so that a very large por-
tion of the work of the Board developed upon Mr. Wisner. Probably no
other man then living could have discharged the arduous duties thus
imposed so well. His long familiarity with the conditions of the Great
Lakes, his experience upon large construction work, and his thorough
acquaintance with the literature of hydraulics and geodesy as found not
only in American and English Treatises, but also in French and German,
enabled him to grasp at once the problems to be handled and bring
them to a prompt and accurate solution. The Board held its first meet-
ing August 11, 1897, and its report is dated December 2, 1900. It is very
doubtful if any similar Commission has ever turned out so much work,
and of so high quality, in so short a time.
Upon the conclusion of this engagement, Mr. Wisner was called


upon by English capitalists to advise as to the proposed ship canal from
Georgian Bay to the St. Lawrence River, and became at once Consult-
ing Engineer for the Montreal, Ottawa and Georgian Bay Canal Com-
pany, for whom he prepared between 1901 and 1904 plans and estimates
for canals and improved river navigation calling for an expenditure of
between $80,000,000 and $100,000,000.
In 1901 and 1902 he became a member of the Engineer Commission
appointed by the Mayor of St. Louis, Mo., to report upon the water sup-
ply of that city, and was also engaged upon the water supply of Erie,
Pa. In 1903 Mr. Wisner was appointed a Consulting Engineer for the
United States Reclamation Service which is expending over $30,000,000
in the construction of reservoirs, dams, canals, tunnels and acqueducts
for irrigation purposes in the arid regions of the United States, to
which service he has devoted about half of his time, the remainder being
reserved for an extensive private practice. In June, 1905, a vacancy
occurring upon the recently organized International Water Ways Com-
mission, President Roosevelt selected Mr. Wisner as the best qualified
engineer to fill the place, so that in addition to his important engage-
ments in the west he is again working for the improvement of navigation
upon the Great Lakes and their connecting waters. His views upon this
great question were set forth in 1900 in a paper on "The Economic Di-
mensions of a Water Way from the Great Lakes to the Atlantic", pub-
lished in Vol. XLV of the Transactions of the American Society of Civil
Engineers.
The writer's acquaintance with Mr. Wisner dates from the first
annual meeting of what has since become The Detroit Engineering So-
ciety, in 1894, at which time he was elected a vice-president of the organi-
zation. It was not at that time expected by the younger members who
had been chiefly responsible for the organization, that the older ones
would take more than a passive interest in its affairs, but they were
soon agreeably disappointed in the case of Mr. Wisner, for he never
failed to attend a committee meeting, presented one of the first papers
before the society, participated in the discussions of almost every paper
read for the first two years, and served as the third president of the
organization.
Mr. Wisner became a member of the American Society of Civil En-
gineers in April, 1876, and served on its Board of Direction from 1898
to 1900.
He is also a member of the National Geographical Society, the De-
troit Club, and the Detroit Board of Commerce.
In addition to the papers already mentioned Mr. Wisner is the author
of "Geodetic Field Work", Trans. Am. Soc. C. E., Vol. XII; "Worthless
Government Engineering", Engineering Magazine, Vol. Ill, and numer


ous other articles in engineering and other periodicals, including two in
previous numbers of "The Technic".
Mr. Wisner was married October 15, 1867, to Miss Carrie Palmer of
Moravia, New Yorki and two sons born of this union are among the
Alumni of Michigan, one, George M., class of '92, ably following his
father's footsteps in Engineering, in Chicago; the other, Ralph E., class
of '98, practicing law in Detroit.
In Mr. Wisner's character we see reflected the same unflinching at-
tendance to duty as was exhibited by his grand-sires during the most
trying period of our Revolutionary history, coupled with the sturdy Scotch
morality inherited from his mother, and in his mentality appear the
marks of German ancestry, which otherwise .aside from his name, would
never be suspected.
Throughout his life he has been ever ready to assist the inexperienced
or the unfortunate, but he never hesitates to mete out criticism where
he believes it deserved, be the object high or low.
So rugged a personality must needs, in its course through life, strike
fire now and again, and sometimes leave smouldering embers, but friend
and foe alike acknowledge his ability, and few are they who coming into
personal contact with him fail to carry away a feeling of admiration
and respect.


PROFESSOR ROBERT SIMPSON WOODWARD
Professor Robert Simpson Woodward, recently elected to the presi-
dency of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, was born at Rochester,
Michigan, July 21, 1849. His early life was spent on a farm with the ex-
ception of about two years of experience in mercantile and manufacturing
pursuits. He was prepared for college at the Rochester Academy, entered
the University of Michigan in 1868, and was graduated in 1872 with the
degree of civil engineer. Twenty years later the same institution con-
ferred upon him the degree of Ph. D. While yet an undergraduate he
entered the U. S. Lake Survey, and immediately after graduation he
was appointed assistant engineer in that service. He was employed in the
astronomical and geodetic work of the Lake Survey until its completion
in 1882. He then accepted the position of assistant astronomer of the
U. S. Transit of Venus Commission and accompanied the expedition of
Professor Asaph Hall, U. S. N., to San Antonio, Texas, to observe the
transit of December, 1882. He remained with the Transit of Venus Com-
mission until 1884, when he resigned to take the position of astronomer
in the U. S. Geological Survey. After six years of service in this bureau
he resigned to accept the position of assistant in the U. S. Coast and
Geodetic Survey. This he held until 1893, when he retired from the
public service and accepted the call of Columbia University to the chair
of mechanics and mathematical physics. In 1895, and again in 1900, he
was elected to the deanship of the graduate faculty of pure science in
that institution.
Professor Woodward has published many papers on subjects in as-
tronomy, geodesy, mathematical physics, and mechanics. He edited,
and contributed several chapter to the final report of the U. S. Lake Sur-
vey, a volume of about one thousand quarto pages devoted chiefly to a
discussion of the geodetic work of the Survey during the forty years of its
existence. He is the author of several of the Bulletins of the U. S.
Geological Survey, and of a memoir on the Iced Bar and Long Tape Base
Apparatus of the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey. These forms of ap-
paratus, devised and perfected by him, involve many novel features and
secure a much higher precision at a much smaller cost than apparatus
previously used. He prepared for the Smithsonian Institution a volume
entitled "Geographical Tables", being a manual for astronomers, geogra-
phers, engineers, and cartographers, published in 1894. Several of his
most important papers relate to geophysics, especially those bearing on
the secular cooling and cubical contraction of the earth, the form and


position of the sea level, the length of the terrestrial day, and on the pro-
foundly difficult problem presented by the recently discovered phenomenon
cf the variation of latitudes. Although most of his publications are nec-
essarily of a highly technical character, he is als,o the author of many
semi-popular addresses and reviews on scientific and educational topics
which have been widely read and appreciated. In this latter field his
work is said to possess a 'distinctly literary quality'. He was an associate
editor of the "Annals of Mathematics'' from 1889 to 1899, and he has been
an associate editor of "Science" since 1894. He has membership in all
of the leading scientific societies of America and has taken an active part
in their work. He has been honored by election to the presidency of the
American Mathematical Society, the New York Academy of Sciences,
and the American Association for the Advancement of Science, of which
latter he has been treasurer since 1894.
He has received honorary degrees as follows: LL. D., University of
Wisconsin, 1904; Sc. D., Pennsylvania University, 1905; Sc. D., Columbia
University, 1905.


JOHN DENISON HBBARD
M. E. Cooley.
The first class to enter the University regularly for the course in
mechanical engineering in the fall of 1883 marked an epoch in the history
of the University. There were six in this class: Frank J. Baker, Joseph
Halsted, John D. Hibbard, James A. Sinclair, Earl P. Wetmore, and
Kendal W. Hess. The course had been announced for the first time in
the calendar of 1881-82. William L. Clements had specialized in mechan-
ical engineering in 1881-82, graduating with the degree of B .S. in 18S2;
and the degree of B. S. in mechanical engineering had been conferred
on Frank M. Dunlap in 1883, on Frank C. Wagner in 1885, and on Clif-
ford C. Smith in 1886; then followed the class of six in 1887, of which
the subject of this sketch is a member.
In those early days, the classes being small, the relations between
teacher and student were often intimate, and the friendships formed under
these conditions become in later life among those most cherished. In
such cases, the responsibility which the teacher always feels for the indi-
vidual success of every student is much enhanced. The young man has
come into his life to stay. They have worked and lived together so
much their tastes and inclinations have grown to be alike. Together they
have planned and dreamed of the future, in their eagerness discounting
the years, the youth anticipating the time when he can give out of his
bountiful success the means which will enable the teacher to determine
the facts regarding some subject unsatisfactorily considered because of
the meagerness of exact information concerning it. The separation at
graduation is for the time being only a divergence of ways; the teacher
watches the career of the youth with keen interest, always hopeful that
he will be successful, proud when he is successful, and when markedly so,
realizing the most satisfying reward which can come to the teacher.
John D. Hibbard, or "Jack" Hibbard, as he was known to everybody
in college, on his arrival in Ann Arbor came first to the writer to seek
help in planning his college course. It was then the custom for the
teacher to discuss with the student at the outset the work^to be pursued,
to steer him clear of conflicts and to see that the studies were taken in the
required sequence to complete the entire work in four years.
There is an added interest in the boy when one knows the family
as well, and the writer remembers vividly that first vacation visit to his
home. It was in Chicago; not the plain, busy Chicago of the man of the
world, but the Chicago of the youthful enthusiast, proud of his birth-
place, the home of the famous Chicago baseball team, and more important
than all, the home of Anson, the great Captain of that team.


JOHN D. HIBBARD


CHARLES G. ATKINS


How bitterly cold it was. The wind from off the lake searched and
found out the very marrow of one's bones, and after a busy day of sight
seeing among the factories what a comfort it was to sit by the grate fire
at night and listen to the stories told by his father, Homer Nash Hibbard,
of his early days in the Green Mountains of Vermont He was born
there at East Bethel, November 7, 1824, and graduated from the Univer-
sity of Vermont in 1850, taking his A. M. degree in 1853. For three
years he was the principal of the Burlington High School; then studied
law at Harvard University, was admitted to the bar in Burlington in
1853, and began his practice the same year in Chicago. Throughout a
busy life he filled many positions of trust with honor, and received the
degree of IX. D. from Blackburn University in 1883. The story of the
father's ancestors took one back into Connecticut and Massachusetts and
finally to one Robert who came from England to Salem in the sixteen-
thirties. And his mother, Jane Hibbard, also of Vermont, daughter of
William Noble, of Burlington, a graduate of the University of Vermont
in 1810, likewise traced her lineage back through Connecticut and Massa-
chusetts to Old England.
From such good old New England stock comes our John D. Hibbard,
who was born in Chicago, Illinois, December 2, 1864, who grew up in
Chicago, was educated in the public schools, and was prepared for college
in the Hyde Park High School from which he graduated in 1882.
Almost immediately on entering college in 1883 Jack became active
in university affairs. He was for four years a member of the University
baseball team, and its Captain for two years, 1884-85 and 1885-86. His
work as pitcher for the team, with "Cliff" Smith behind the bat, won for
the University a string of victories the talk in college life for years after-
wards. His skill lay in his command of the various "curves" which it
had at about that time been found possible to give the pitched ball. He
delighted in giving a demonstration to the skeptical by placing three poles
in a line and then shooting a ball outside the end poles and inside the
middle one.
Jack was also a member of the Athletic Board, the Palladium Board
and the Chronicle Board, and a member of the University Glee Club, in
all of which he took a leading part. Many will remember him in the
Glee Club as the leader in the chair drill in that old college,favorite, the
song of Tobias and Bohunkus, the last line of which wound: up with
"Cornell" placarded in large letters on the bottom of the chairs.'
His college fraternity is the Sigma Phi, which was also his father's
at the University of Vermont
As a student in college Jack was well above the average, and had
he not deliberately chosen to give so much of his time to college affairs,
could easily have made a record in his studies. He was no plodder, and
occasionally when required by his other duties to absent himself from


class would get behind in his work, but he invariably made up and fre-
quently came in ahead at the finish. This was especially true in the
courses in machine design in which as a student he was particularly apt.
Immediately after graduation in 1887 Mr. Hibbard entered the em-
ploy of The John Davis Co., in Chicago, with which concern he has been
connected ever since. In 1889 he became its Vice-President, and in iooi,
on the death of Mr. Davis, its President. The yearly business of this
company reaches into the millions.
Soon after graduation he joined the American Society of Mechani-
cal Engineers, and when the American Society of Heating and Ventilat-
ing Engineers was organized he became an active member of that society.
He is at present a director of the Chicago University of Michigan Alumni
Association, and a member of its Advisory Board; also a member of the
Chicago Engineering Alumni Association of this University, serving as
its president in 1904-05.
In the commercial world Mr. Hibbard is a member of several trade
associations in which he has been called to take a very active part, partic-
ularly in the Chicago Metal Trades Association of which he was president
in 1003-04.
Mr. Ray Stannard Baker has given the world an excellent article
on employers' organizations in the July number of McClure's Magazine,
1904. He says, "Employers' Associations as now constituted may be
divided roughly into two classes:
"First, those which propose to fight the unions. Their leaders
emphasize the fact that industry is war.
"Second, those which seek to deal with the unions. Their leaders
emphasize the fact that industry is business."
In his detailed account of the organizations of the second class he
refers to the Metal Trades Association in the following language:
"The Chicago Metal Trades Association is an organization of more
than one hundred manufacturers, employing some 15,000 men. Its pres-
ident is John D. Hibbard, of the John Davis Company
"Mr. Hibbard is the genius of the association, a man of enthusiasm
and earnestness, a graduate of the University of Michigan, with a train-
ing in fair play on the college ball-field. But more than anything else,
he has the open mind, the mind that is constantly instructed by events.
When he first went into business in Chicago he fought unionism consist-
ently and energetically; he has gone through no fewer than seventeen
strikes in as many years.
"'I have had men brought into my office,' he told me, 'with heel'
marks in their faces, I have seen violence that made my blood boil.'
"And his conclusion finally was that there must be a better way
than this perpetual and often bloody warfare with results not less disas-
trous to the manufacturers than to the workmen themselves. He con-


eluded that it was worth while, at least, to try dealing with the union.
Two or three things, he told me, impressed themselves upon him as self-
evident truths.
"i. That the employer and the worker are naturally antagonistic,
exactly as the seller and buyer are antagonistic—but not necessarily
pugilistic.
"2. That the right isn't all on one side.
"3. That the old idea among employers of waiting until there was
trouble and then getting together hastily to meet a well-trained labor
organization, was no more sensible than sending a mob out to meet an
army; and finally, that a good fighter doesn't despise his opponents—an
important point.
"'Well,' he said, 'I believed that we were not qualified to judge on all
the questions involved unless we had an accurate knowledge of the facts
as they appeared to the other side. The question then presented itself:
how are we going to get those facts? The answer was evident: by
getting together with the union men and finding out through personal
relationship what sort of men they were and whether or not they were
as arbitrary and unreasonable as we had supposed.'"
A committee of six was appointed, three by the union and three by
the Association. As Mr. Baker says:
"When they got together they were all suspicious of each other, each
expecting some trick, enemies come to arrange a truce. Mr. Hibbard then
stated the case to the conference:
"'We are here, gentlemen, in good faith and in good temper. Neither
of us wants any more trouble; we've had enough of it. We want to find
out, frankly, what you men want, and we will tell you frankly what we
want. We believe we can discuss everything, everything, mind you, and
stay good-natured, and that we can finally come to an agreement satis-
factory to both sides.'"
The work of this joint committee led to a preliminary agreement
signed by all the unions of which the principal clause was: "That pend-
ing such settlement there shall be no lockout or strike."
"'We insisted upon four cardinal principles,' said Mr. Hibbard.
'First, no limitation of output; second, no sympathetic strike; third, no
cessation of work under any circumstances; and fourth, freedom in the
employment of labor. A great deal is said about the 'open shop' but
there is no real problem involved if both sides are willing to be fair.
We say to the unions: 'We will not compel any man to belong to your
union in order to work in our shops and you should not attempt to make
us. A man coerced by us or intimidated by you is of no value to you.
There's the non-union man; if you can persuade him fairly to belong to
your union, all right; if not, you must not interfere with him or his
work."*


"All these points as well as those pertaining to hours, wages and
so on, were agreed to and a year's contract covering every issue was
signed with each organization."
The conditions discussed so interestingly by Mr. Baker were unfortu-
nately destined to be short lived. The "Joint Trade Agreement" of
May I, 1903, lasted only the year through and the attempt to renew this
agreement in 1904 failed. Offers to arbitrate were rejected by the ma-
chinists and a strike of eighteen months' duration followed. Mr. Hib-
bard's part in this controversy was conspicuous. The Chicago Evening
Post commenting editorially May 24, 1904, said:
"The statement made to the public by Mr. Hibbard, president of the
Metal Trades Association, would seem to leave the machinists without a
shred of logical or reasonable defense. Mr. Hibbard shows that the
Association has - stood for 'fair agreements, based upon accurate data,
honest relations, and varying conditions and arbitration where necessary.'
These, as Mr. Hibbard says, 'suggest far more rational solutions than
strikes and lockouts, intimidation and injunction, with their attendant
cost, hardship and engendered hatred.'"
The Chicago Inter Ocean, May 29, 1904, contains a review of the
situation in an article by Luke Grant from which I quote:
"A unique feature of the present strike is the respect the strike
leaders have for the leader of the opposition forces. John D. Hibbard,
president of the Metal Trades Association, is regarded as an absolutely
fair man by every Union officer who has had any dealings with him. Not
a harsh word is uttered against him at the strike headquarters, and the
radicals admit that 'John will give us a fair fight.' This spirit is so un-
usual in labor controversies that it is worthy of notice. In speaking of
the trouble yesterday, Organizer Fitzpatrick of the Chicago Federation
of Labor, said: 'It is a pity that the men with whom Hibbard has to
deal do not understand him. He is one employer who can be trusted,
for he is absolutely fair and honest' . and still it was Hib-
bard's idea that led to the strike. Whether his idea is right
or not, there is no doubt that he will prove as worthy a foe as he has a
friend in the past, for his face denotes the man who has the strength of
his convictions and who will fight for them to the end."
He is now the President of the Central Supply Association compris-
ing the largest manufacturers and jobbers of steam and plumbers goods
in this country.
Mr. Hibbard was married December 11, 1889, to Josie W. Davis, and
has two children, Helen, 14, and John Davis, 10 years of age.
Here is a type of man whose antecedents, education and training
have taught him to live this life with a knowledge of his fellow men, in a
spirit of fairness and with a just appreciation of the rights of others.


CHARLES GILMAN ATKINS
Charles Gilman Atkins was born Feb. 16, 1865, at Tiffin, Ohio. He
spent the usual allotment of time in the public schools of his native
town, to within a few weeks of graduation, when an incident occurred
in which he always felt considerable pride, and which exerted a great
influence on his going into engineering work, viz: The superintendent
of the public schools received an application for three boys of mechanical
turn of mind, to become candidates for the position of Electrician of the
local Edison Electric Light Plant, and it was his good fortune to be
chosen. Those were the days (1884), when the starting of a central sta-
tion for incandescent lighting and especially a station with the wonderful
name of "Edison" connected with it, created a genuine stir.
During his school years at Tiffin he spent the most of his vacations
in the different departments of the Tiffin Agricultural Works of which
his father, Benjamin G. Atkins, was president.
After a continuous service of about three years in the electric lighting
plant, and the shops of the Tiffin Agricultural Works, he left Tiffin to
enter the engineering department of the Ohio State University; this
period was from the Fall of '86 to January, '88.
From early in '88 to the Fall of '89, Mr. Atkins was employed, in
the field and office, of the Ohio Canal Commission which was engaged in
a Topographical Survey of the Canal Systems of the state.
In the Fall of '89 he went to the University of Michigan where he
was able to secure considerable advance credit on work done at the Ohio
State University, and after a residence of seven semesters, completed
the requisite amount of work, in February, '93, graduating B. S. (E. E.)
in June, '93.
After a short vacation at Tiffin, he went to Pittsburg, Pa., and en-
tered the Westinghouse Electrical and Manufacturing Co., as a "Stu-
dent." After the usual career he was placed in the testing rooms, remain-
ing there about two and one-half years. In this time he had, in turn,
charge of the several departments in the testing room including special
work in the developing of machinery. During the latter half of this time
he was First Assistant to the Chief Engineer of the testing depart-
ment, and was closely associated with designing the layout of the testing
facilities in the new works at East Pittsburg upon the removal of the
works from Pittsburg proper.
For several months Mr. Atkins was district engineer for the West-
inghouse Electrical and Manufacturing Co., with headquarters at Boston.


In the Spring of '96 he came to Chicago and entered the employ of
the Chicago Edison Co., spending about one year in the drawing room,
most of the time being closely associated with the developing of the
earliest installation of this Company for the generating of high tension
alternating current at their large central points and converting same into
low tension direct current by means of rotary transformers at substa-
tions for their distributing systems.
For about three years he was superintendent of the repair shops
of the Chicago Edison Co. These shops were well equipped with neces-
sary tools, and a force of 50 to 60 men for the repairing of anything con-
nected with an electric light plant. It was during this period he tried
to learn "what not to do" and it was a very interesting work for any one
fond of variety and rush.
During the past year with the Chicago Edison Co., he was Power
Engineer to the contracting department in which capacity he made studies
of the economies of the isolated plants of the city. While in this last named
work, he became interested in an independent career as a consulting en-
gineer, and August I, 1901, went into a partnership with Mr. C. A. Pratt,
an established consulting engineer with offices in the Monadnock Bldg.,
Chicago. The firm of Pratt &amp; Atkins continued and enjoyed a success-
ful general practice until August 1, 1904, and upon the withdrawal of
Mr. Pratt from the firm, Mr. Atkins succeeded to the business. His
work at present consists of industrial power plants and the machinery
equipments of business buildings of which there are many examples in and
out of the city.
He has just about completed the power plant in the Majestic Theatre
building, the plant consisting of three direct connected Corliss units. In
this plant is being installed one of the first coal conveying plants, raising
coal from the underground railway system into the boiler room.
He is now engaged on the electrical and mechanical equipment of
the Michael Reese Hospital of this city. The work consists of a com-
plete power plant, heating, ventilating, elevators, lighting, refrigera-
tion and other details connected with an extensive proposition of this
nature.
As Mr. Atkins says, his one motto has always been, work, work,
WORK, and his success in his chosen profession is ample proof of it


THE EXPERIMENTAL SHIP TANK OF THE UNIVER-
SITY OF MICHIGAN
Herbert C. Sadler, D. Sc. Professor or Marine Engineering.
As the experimental tank and apparatus connected therewith is now
completed, a short account of the method of preparation and testing of
ship models may be of interest at this time.
In the first place it may be pertinent to describe in a general way the
object of the tank. The shape or lines of a vessel, together with the esti-
mate of the horse power necessary to drive her any given speed, is the
most interesting and at the same time most difficult part of the naval arch-
itect's work. Fortunately or unfortunately the nature of the conditions to
be fulfilled are rarely the same for any two ships, so that although former
experience, properly and scientifically applied, may be of great value in
solving any new problem in ship propulsion that may arise, it seldom
happens that a new design is the exact counterpart of a former one. It
is, therefore, difficult to say beforehand what the effect of modifications of
a vessel's form will be, and even more difficult to say which is the best
form to fulfil any given set of conditions.
The primary object of the tank is to perform experiments upon various
forms of ships and to determine the resistance to motion of these forms
at all speeds. In general the line of work that will be followed will be
of a systematic character, that is to say, models of various forms will be
tried and the effect upon the resistance of modification of these forms,
such as variations of the ratios of length to beam or draft, determined.
Numerous other experiments such as the effect of bilge keels upon the
rolling and speed of vessels will also receive attention.
The tank itself is 300 feet long, 22 feet wide, and 10 feet deep, and
forms the basement to the east wing of the New Engineering building.
This length is the least that can be used in order to allow time for start-
ing, obtaining uniform speed and stopping. The breadth and depth are
necessary so that the effect of the sides and bottom will not have any
material influence upon the resistance of the model. Spanning the tank
is a traveling truck which runs on rails on either side of the tank. This
truck, shown in Plate 2, is driven by a 25 H. P. motor whose speed can
be so regulated as to give speeds to the truck varying from about ten feet
per minute up to eight hundred feet per minute. It is essential that the
speed of the truck should be uniform at any speed between these limits,
so that the resistance of the model may be determined accurately at any


speed. The models are run at a series of different speeds and a curve
of resistance in terms of speed obtained. In order that the speed may be
uniform and not affected by changes of load in the power house, a special
motor generator set has been installed, and owing to exigencies of space
and also for convenience, has been placed upon the truck. The current
from the power house is taken to this set by trolleys and converted as re-
quired. The connections are such that if any fluctuation takes place upon
the line, this is compensated for in the installation and the speed of the
driving motor remains unaffected. The speed is regulated by a controller
with five main stops, and between each stop an auxiliary rheostat with
fifty stops may be thrown in, so that between the limits of speed given
above, two hundred and fifty different speeds may be obtained. The
driving motor is also fitted with a high and low speed gear. The switch-
board and connections are also mounted on the truck.
On the forward end of the truck is the dynamometer through which
the models are towed. This consists essentially of a vertical bar mounted
on Emery supports, that is to say, instead of the usual knife edge a thin
piece of spring steel is used, with about one-sixteenth of an inch between
the supports. This gives a rigid but flexible and practically frictionless
bearing. Parallel rods are introduced so that both the pull upon the
spring and model are in a horizontal direction. The model is attached
to the lower end of the dynamometer and its resistance taken up by the
spring as shown in Plate 3. The amount of extension of the spring is
registered upon a revolving drum which is driven from the main shaft
of the truck. Upon this drum are two other pens, one of which is con-
nected to a clock and registers every half second, the other is connected
with contacts along the side of the tank and registers every ten feet. Thus
the time and distance and hence speed are determined. Two other pens
register the amount that the model rises or falls at the bow or stern,
when moving at different speeds. While not at present installed, a cam-
era will also be arranged so that a photograph of the wave formation may
be obtained. The above are the principal observations that are taken in
connection with the truck and dynamometer.
The preparations of the models themselves will now be considered.
The substance of which the models are made is parafine wax with a mix-
ture of about four per cent bees wax. This material is the same as that
used in most laboratories of this kind, and was chosen for the following
reasons: It is very easy to handle, that is to say, it may be melted at
a low temperature and cast without difficulty; it is also easily cut, planed
or scraped; it enables us to have a uniform surface for all models, and
when a model is not required for further experimenting it may be broken
up and used for another of a different type.
Before casting a model a mould is first prepared. This mould is


made in ordinary modelling clay. Sections of the vessel at different points
in its length are first cut out of wood, about one-quarter of an inch larger
than the actual size required. These are placed in the bed and the clay
moulded and faired in until it conforms to the proper shape. As the
models have to be cast hollow, a core is next made. The forms as above
are cut out so as to allow a thickness of paraffin wax of about one and
one-half inches. These forms are then connected together by thin wooden
strips and covered with canvass, so that the core forms as it were a can-
vass canoe which is suspended inside the clay mould. The paraffin wax
is then melted in a tank provided with a steam coil and the mould poured.
While cooling considerable contraction occurs so that small quantities of
melted wax must be added continually. While the wax is being poured,
water is introduced into the inside of the core in order to overcome its
tendency to float and also to aid in cooling.
When cooled the core is withdrawn and the model floated from its bed
by introducing water between the walls of the mould and the model. The
model is now in its rough ftate and ready to be cut to the correct form.
It is next placed in the cutting machine (Plates 3 and 4). This machine
consists primarily of two tables, on one of which is placed the model
and on the other the drawing of the lines which it is desired to reproduce.
These two tables move together and are driven by a motor, the motion
of the driving table is, however, usually about one-half as fast as that
of the model table; but this ratio can be varied by introducing change
gears. The object of this is so that the drawings do not have to be made
unnecessarily large. In the middle of the machine is a cross piece upon
which are two traveling heads which move together inwards or outwards
and are operated by a right and left handed screw by means of the handle
shown on the right hand side immediately over the drawing. These heads
carry two vertical hollow spindles which have a screw thread cut on the
outside. By means of a worm gear these may be raised or lowered to
any desired extent, the amount of the vertical movement being measured
by a scale and vernier upon one of them. Inside each spindle is a shaft
which is driven by a vertical motor on the top, and to the bottom of which
is attached a two-bladed cutter. As the in and out motion of the cutters
must correspond with the breadth upon the drawing at various points, the
motion of the cutters is transferred to the drawing by means of a panto-
graph. One end of the pantograph is attached to one of the cutters and
the other moveable or center part to a bar which is carried over to the
drawing, and on the end of which is a pointer. If for example the draw-
ing is one-half the size of the model, the arms of the pantograph are set
in this ratio. When therefore the screw which operates the heads carrying
the cutters is revolved, the cutters move in or out a certain amount, and
the pointer on the drawing one-half this amount. As, however, the points


of the cutters describe circles, the pointer is also a circle but of one-half
the radius of the cutter circle. (In cases where a different ratio of length
to breadth from that as shown in the drawing, is being cut, the pointer
is an ellipse). In Plate I it will be noticed that an adjusting lever is at-
tached to the fixed arm of the pantograph, the reason for which is as fol-
lows: It sometimes happens that the drawing paper and hence the center
line of the drawing may become warped. Under these circumstances the
cutters would not be cutting the actual breadth from the center line, but
from some imaginary straight line. The end of this lever is therefore
attached to a frame which carries a roller, which bears against a batten
which is placed upon the center line of the drawing, no matter what form
this has taken. If the center line is slightly curved the roller follows this
curve and moves the fixed end of the pantograph a corresponding amount
and therefore compensates for this error.
From one drawing it is possible to cut any number of models of the
same form but varying in ratio of beam or draught to length. If a broader
or narrower model is desired all that has to be done is to alter the fulcrum
of the pantograph and the relative motions of the cutter and pointer on
the drawing are altered accordingly. If it is desired to change the ratio
of draught to length, the amount by which the vertical motion of the
cuters is changed for each waterline may be correspondingly increased or
decreased.
The method of operation is as follows: The model is placed upside
down upon its table carefully centered and clamped down, the drawing
is also placed upon its table and the center line adjusted. The cutters are
now run up to the bottom of the model and moved in so that they nearly
touch. They are then put into motion, as is also the table, and the base
line or top of keel cut from o:ie end to the other. The cutters are now
lowered to a depth corresponding to the first waterline as shown on the
drawing. The cutting is usually started from amidships and worked both
ways toward the ends. The operator now runs in the cutters until the
pointer is exactly upon the line required and starts the two tables mov-
ing. By operating the handle on the right and left handed screw, the
cutters are gradually brought together and their motion transferred to the
pointer. He must so regulate this motion that the pointer remains tangent
to the line he desires to follow, while the drawing moves along. In this
way the cutters are made to follow exactly any desired line. When one
line has been cut they are lowered to the next and so on until all the lines
have been cut. When this part of the work is finished, the model has
the appearance as shown in Plate 4, that is to say, a series of longitudinal
grooves have been cut, which represent the correct shape of the various
watcrlines. It is now taken to the finishing table and the superfluous
material between the grooves removed by a chisel, plane, or spokeshave


PLATE 3.


until the grooves have almost disappeared. It is finally finished with a
scraper and when the grooves have just disappeared and the surface is
fair, it receives a final burnishing. The position of the desired load or any
other water line is now marked upon it at different points and check
measurements are taken to see if the model is correct to the drawings.
It is then carefully weighed and placed in the tank. The amount of bal-
last, which consists of shot bags, necessary to bring the model down to the
desired load line, is also calculated and weighed out. This is now put
into the model and moved until the latter floats upright and in her correct
trim. This is the final check that the model receives, as it should float
at its correct waterline when the calculated amount of ballast has been
added.
The attachment for the towing and steering rods are now made and
the model connected up to the dynamometer.
The models used are from ten to twelve feet long, and may repre-
sent a vessel of any size. In order to predict the resistance of a full
sized ship from that of a model, Froude's "law of comparison" is used.
The total resistance of a vessel consists of two parts, surface friction and
wave making resistance. The frictional resistance may be calculated for
any kind of surface whether parraffine, paint, copper, etc., from the knowl-
edge of the corresponding coefficients of friction of these surfaces. If
this be subtracted from the total, the remainder will be the wave making
resistance. According to Froude's law, this resistance varies as the cube
of the lineal dimensions at corresponding speeds, i. e., at speeds varying
as the square root of the lineal dimensions. For example, if a model were
one forty-ninth the full size and were towed at a speed of three knots per
hour, the corresponding speed of the full sized ship would be 7 X 3 = 21
knots. If at this speed of three knots the wave making resistance of the
model were say three pounds, the wave making resistance of the
full sized ship would be 3 X (49)* = 352,947 pounds (at 21 knots). To
this must be added the frictional resistance, calculated as explained above,
in order to obtain the total resistance of the vessel.
It is therefore possible to experiment with models at fairly low
speeds and yet obtain results which correspond with high speeds in the
full sized ship.
The subject of resistance of ship's forms is one which requires a
large amount of investigation, and it is expected that the work done at the
University will help towards the solution of many problems and prove a
benefit to the profession of Naval Architecture as a whole.


TESTS OF IMPULSE WHEELS AT THE UNIVERSITY
OF MICHIGAN
Paper by Ralph R. Tinkham, '05, Jun. Am. Soc. C. E., and
Justin T. Kingdon, '06.
PREFATORY.
The Impulse Wheel is the so-called hurdy-gurdy, known as the
"impulse and reaction" type as distinguished from the turbine wheel. It
consists essentially of a wheel on a horizontal shaft to the rim of which
are fastened a series of vanes or buckets receiving the impact of one or
more jets of water. It is particularly adapted to the use of high heads
and small quantities of water, relying on the impulsive and reactive
force of the water on the vanes rather than the pressure of a large, slow
moving mass of water. Impulse wheels are built of diameters of from
0.5 foot to 10 feet and are used under heads ranging from 25 feet to
over 2,000 feet. These wheels have been built to develop as high as
9,000 horse power.
At the University of Michigan the first tests were run on impulse
wheels in 1889, and since then have been continued intermittently up to
the present time. The results of these tests form the subject matter of
this paper.
Each type of bucket has been treated separately and under each head
there have been collected data from the various tests of that bucket. Each
bucket has been described and under each test the apparatus used and
methods employed have been noted together with such points as would in
any way affect the results obtained.
It is believed that the actual results obtained are of considerable
more value than curves and for this reason data are presented in tabular
form. Efficiency curves may readily be plotted, using as absiscae, Revo-
lutions per Second, and as ordinates, Efficiencies. The tables themselves
are condensed, the essential items only being given. In the original tests
two observations for speeds were made for each run, the average being
given here. Under remarks are given the conditions under which each
test was run. The nozzle positions given under the tests of the Univer-
sity of Michigan motor and the Leffel cascade wheel are intended to be
the proper nozzle adjustments for best performance of the wheel governed
by the other conditions, these adjustments having been fully determined
by a series of runs made before each test with various nozzle positions.

The wheel efficiencies given, excepting the test of the Hug water
wheel, have been entirely recomputed throughout, and the bucket efficien-
cies where given have, with the same exception, been newly added. The
wheel efficiencies, except as noted in the tests of the Tuerk and Dayton
motors, are entirely independent of nozzle efficiencies, for as will be seen
by referring to the computations following the Theory of the Impulse
Wheel, the gross work or the actual power in the jet after leaving the
nozzle is used in determining the efficiencies, instead of the power in the
water at the base of the nozzle. Use of the latter quantity would give
what we have termed the commercial efficiency of the wheel, i. e, the
efficiency of the bucket, wheel, and nozzle combined. We do not give these
commercial efficiencies where the wheel efficiencies are obtainable, but
they may readily be determined by using the Head on the Nozzle given
under Remarks, which is the head in feet at the base of the nozzle, instead
of the velocity head at the tip of the nozzle which we have used. The
Gross Work given under Remarks is the power in the jet after leaving
the nozzle. A table giving a summary of the maximum efficiencies of
wheels tested at the University of Michigan is given at the close of the
article.
The action of jets within buckets, and its influence on the design and
efficiency of buckets is fully discussed in a paper entitled Tangential Water
Wheel Efficiencies by Geo. J. Henry, Jr., presented before the Pacific
Coast Electric Transmission Association, June, 1903, and a paper on
Tangential Water Wheels by Mr. W. A. Doble, Vol. 29, Transactions
of the American Society of Mining Engineers. A brief bibliography of
the Impulse Wheel will be found at the end of this article.
THEORY OE THE IMPULSE WHEEL.
Only such formulae as have direct
bearing upon the tests of the im-
pulse wheel as regards velocity ra-
tios of the jet and bucket for max-
imum power derived from the wheel,
the proper form of bucket for max-
imum efficiency, besides the general
method of reduction of results will
be given here. For a complete dis-
cussion of the theory of the impulse
wheel we would refer to Notes on
Water Wheels by M. E. Cooley and
Hydraulic Motors by I. P. Church.
Referring to Fig. 1, let a jet of
velocity v from a nozzle N, impinge
upon a bucket, B, having a velocity of u in the same direction. On leav-
Fig.1


ing the bucket, the water will have a velocity relative to the bucket of
y = v — w (i)
neglecting friction. If the jet leaves the bucket at an angle 8, the abso-
lute velocity, or the velocity of the discharge from the bucket with respect
to the earth is z, and referring to the figure
z* = y* + u* — 2 y u cos 8 (2)
Substituting the value of y* = v* — 2 »«♦ + «* in (2),
z1 = i? — (2 v u — 2 «') (1 + cos 8) (3)

value of z2 from (3) in (4) we have for the useful work

G = (6)

The expression for the efficiency, then, is

which reduces to 2 u (1 + cos 8) = » (1 + cos 8) from which
v
u = (9)

Remembering that « is the linear velocity of a bucket or the peri-
pheral velocity of the wheel, and v, the velocity of the impinging jet, it
follows that to obtain the maximum power from an impulse wheel, the
speed of the wheel should be one half that of the jet if friction is
neglected.
To determine the proper form of bucket for best efficiency substitute
the value of u = v/2 from (9) in equation (7) from which we obtain
E = Vi (1 + cos 8 (10)


Whence it follows directly that with a flat vane, 8 = go", the efficiency
of the wheel can never be greater than 50%, but that by decreasing the
angle of discharge 8, the efficiency can be increased to a maximum theo-
retical efficiency of 100% when 8 = 180°, in which case the jet would
leave the bucket in the opposite direction and parallel to the impinging jet.

THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN MOTOR.
Inasmuch as many of the following tests have been made with the
use of the University of Michigan motor, and as this apparatus has been,
and is now, used at the University of Michigan for tests of bucket efficien-
cies, we give here a description of the motor and the general arrangement
of accessory apparatus for conducting a test.
Realizing that in order to determine the best coditions for any given
bucket, it was necessary to test it on a wheel capable of a great many
different adjustments, a wheel was designed and built in the winter of
1890 to fulfill any of the requirements that might appear in testing any
form of bucket suitable for this general type of wheel. The designs were
made after suggestions of Professor M. E. Cooley, by Mr. C. E. DePuy,
now Professor of Mechanical Engineering, Lewis Institute, Chicago.
Plate I from a photograph shows the University of Michigan motor
complete. Fig. I, Plate II shows, A, the side elevation of the motor and
nozzle tube with its mountings, with the upper part of the case in part
section to show the bucket gauge and wheel, and a part section of the
base to show the construction; B, an end elevation of the motor; C,
a vertical transverse section of the case, wheel, and bucket gauge. Fig.
2, Plate II shows in detail the construction of the nozzle and its ad-
justments in section and elevation. Fig. 3, Plate II, shows the details
of the bucket gauge and wheel in section and elevation.
The base of he case C is 25 Vi inches long and 9^ inches wide. The
height of the motor from the top of the base plate D to the top of the re-
movable cover E is 24^4 inches. The case is made of cast iron about
$i inch thick. The base D is bolted to the main part C and the joint is
made water tight with a paper gasket. The cover £ is not fastened but
is held in position by its weight, the inwardly projecting flanges prevent-
ing the water from running out at the joint. On each side of the case C
there are left openings C 15 inches long by 5 inches wide in which are
fastened plate glass windows so that the action of the jet on the bucket
can be plainly seen. The plate glass is held in the frame by screws and
short iron straps and the joint is made water tight by soft rubber pack-
ing fastened to the case.


The wheel mounted on shaft F, is made of four cast iron arms G
(Fig. 3, Plate II), to which are screwed two brass rings H Hi, set M
inch apart and having on the side next the arms a corner cut out'of each
so as to leave a continuous slot. In this slot are placed the T headed
bolts / which hold the bucket brackets / in place. The buckets K are
fastened to the brackets / by the lugs K' and screws L. The lugs K' fit
closely in corresponding notches /' in the end of the brackets /, and the
screws L hold them in place. The brackets / are made with an offset
on the outer end so that the bottoms of the notches /' lie in the central
plane of the wheel. Any buckets having suitable lugs can be fastened to
the wheel and the number can be anything up to 30. The buckets / and
hence the face of the buckets, can be tilted 400 in either direction from
a radial line and are held in position by the bolts /. The adjustment of the
angle of these brackets by means of the gauge A will be explained later.
The diameter of the outer ring of the wheel is 12 inches and the thick-
ness of the rings is Vi inch.
The shaft F is of mild steel one inch diameter and 17 inches long.
It runs in self-oiling boxes lined with "Magnolia" metal. This lining
does not extend the entire length of the box casting but at the ends are
left the annular spaces, e and e' (C, Fig. 1, Plate II, for the purpose
of preventing the oil and water from running through the box to the out-
side of the frame. The collars, f, fastened to the shaft by set screws, run
in the annular spaces, e, at the inner ends of the "Magnolia" metal
bushings and serve the double purpose of preventing end motion of the
shaft and of throwing off, by centrifugal force, into the space, e, the
water that follows along the shaft . The hole at the bottom of the space,
e, allows this water to run back into the inside of the motor case. The
annular spaces, e', at the other end of the boxes catch the oil that works
through the journal and return it to the oil chamber, h, from which it is
drawn up again by the wick in the bottom of the bearing.
The nozzle tube, U (Fig. 2, Plate II), and all its mountings are of
brass. It can be adjusted in three ways. The front end, C, of the case,
C, is vertical and on its planed surface is fastened by four cap screws,
the slide W, in the center of which is pivoted on the trunnions, V, the
nozzle tube carrier V. The part of this tube carrier which lies within
the slide W is cylindrical, concentric with the trunnions and its ends are
faced square so that when the space between the inner surface of W
and the outer surface of V is filled with babbit metal, it allows the nozzle
tube carrier to be rotated on its trunnions V, and at the same time keep
the joint water tight. The nozzle tube U slides longitudinally inside of its
carrier V but is rotated in a vertical plane with it. The slide W is
moved by a screw and hand wheel W\. Its position is indicated by a
graduated scale, on the side of the slide, reading with the vernier, hun-


dredths of an inch. The zero of this scale is on a horizontal line through
the center of the wheel and the readings indicate the vertical distance from
the center of the wheel to the center of the nozzle tube. The nozzle
tube has also a graduated scale reading, with its vernier, hundredths
of an inch and its zero so placed that the readings indicate the horizontal
distance from the center of the wheel to the inner end of the nozzle tube.
The nozzle tube is moved by the clamping collar X and the screw and
hand wheel Xi. The segment Y, graduated in degrees, is fastened to the
trunnion V and indicates the angle which the center line of the nozzle
makes with the horizontal. The angle is adjusted by the screw and hand
wheel Yu The horizontal distance from the center of the wheel to the
center of the trunnions V is 12.05 inches.
To find the distance from the end of the nozzle to the center line of
the wheel, the length of the nozzle, measuring from the nozzle tube to the
tip, is subtracted from the nozzle tube reading. The external diameter
of the nozzle tube is 2^s inches and its outer end is threaded exetrnally to
receive 2" iron pipe fittings and its inner end is threaded internally to
fit iH inch iron pipe. The nozzle, U, used in all the experiments here
described is made of mild steel. Its total length is 5 inches and the
length from the shoulder to the tip is 4 inches. The conical hole has an
angle of 20 degrees and the tip is a standard tube, J6 inch diameter and
■2l/i diameters, or 15/16 inch long.
The bucket brackets are spaced and the angles adjusted by means
of the gauge shown in A, Fig. I and in Fig. 3, Plate II. The body or
frame A, of the gauge has, at one end, a circular projection bored with
a radius equal to the radius of the hub of the motor wheel and at the
other end a hole drilled at a distance from the center of the circle of the
projection just mentioned, equal to the radius of the center of the circular
slot in the wheel, carrying the T headed bolts / (Fig. 3, Plate II). In
this hole is fastened, by a nut on the outside a bushing which carries
the graduated arc R, and its gauge arm N. In the bushing is placed a
collar screw having a small pin O at the end. Through a shoulder on
the collar screw and the large collar is drilled a 5/32 inch hole which re-
ceives the hooked gauge B. The small pin O", at the end of the screw
O and the hook B', on the end of the gauge B, fit into holes drilled in
the ends of the T headed bolts /. The collar screw is clamped by the
nut Q, and the arc M is clamped to the frame A by the screw 5* and the
lever T.
In using this gauge the arc M is set at the angle to which it is desired
to adjust the buckets, and clamped. The gauge B is adjusted so that the
distance between the pins O and B' is equal to the chord of the arc which
is to measure the distance between two consecutive buckets. The frame
A is then placed upon the hub of the motor wheel, the pin O is inserted


in the center hole of one of the bolts /, the corresponding bracket / is
brought into contact with the gauge AT, and the nut on the bolt / is
tightened, by a special wrench. The pin O is then inserted in the center
hole of the next bolt / and the hook B' is inserted in the center hole of
the bolt just tightened, the bracket / is brought up to the gauge N and
the nut tightened as before, and so on. If the gauge B is set properly
the spacing will be uniform and the gauge will fit between the last and the
first buckets fastened. In Fig. I, Plate II the bucket gauge is shown set
at IS degrees which throws the bucket back that amount from a radial
line. In Fig. 3, Plate II it is set at o degrees making the bucket face
radial.
The motor was constructed by the students in the various shops of
the Engineering Laboratory at the University of Michigan and Mr. De-
Puy graduated the various scales and made the final adjustments.
When completed the motor was placed on a platform suspended from
the ceiling of the Experimental Laboratory and so connected with a
Gordon 6" x 4" x 6" Duplex Steam Pump as to give a perfectly uniform
supply of water. Fig. I, Plate IV, gives a general plan of the connec-
tions of the motor as used previous to 1905, and Fig. 2, Plate III, from
a photograph, shows all the apparatus as it was actually used. The draw-
ing shows the wheel fitted with a brake strap, and the photograph the
same fitted with the prony brake, both being used in the tests that follow.
The water was drawn from a cistern outside the Laboratory and
forced into a steel pressure tank capable of carrying 150 lbs. pressure
and having a capacity of about 165 gallons. The discharge from the
tank was controlled by a 3-inch gate valve and this valve was connected
to the motor by about 3 feet of 3.V2 inch rubber fire hose. The nozzle
of the motor having a motion longitudinally, made it necessary to give the
hose connection a means of moving simultaneously, and this was done
by putting an expansion joint on the pipe to which the hose was con-
connected. To prevent this joint from being pushed out by the pres-
sure, a balancing piston, having the same diameter as the expansion
joint, was placed directly opposite and the two connected by bolts, as
shown by the drawing.
Directly beneath the motor was placed a platform scale and on that
was set an open wooden tank having a capacity of about 1,600 lbs. of
water. At the bottom of this tank was placed a valve and pipe leading
to a sewer, for the purpose of emptying it. Into the bottom of the motor
was screwed a 4-inch three-way stop cock. One outlet opened into the
tank and the other connected, by a 4-inch pipe with the cistern from
which the water was drawn. To the steam supply pipe of the steam
pump was fitted a Curtis Automatic pressure regulator, the regulating
diaphragm being connected to the pressure tank.


Upon the motor shaft was placed a brake wheel, 7.92 inches diameter,
with external and internal flanges,—that it could be supplied with water
to absorb the heat produced by the friction. The brake strap used was a
strap of tempered spring steel J^ inch wide and .0137 inch thick. The
upper end of this brake strap was hung to a spring balance and the lower
end was fastened to a rod with a flat disc at the bottom upon which the
weights were placed. The brake strap, from the top of the brake wheel,
the rod and plate weighed exactly one pound.
The speed of the motor was determined by a Heath self-timing speed
indicator, which ran for one-half a minute and stopped automatically
indicating the revolutions for a whole minute.
This was operated by a time train regulated by a hair spring balance
and lever escapement like a watch. This speed counter was combined
with a stop watch in a device whereby both could be started simultan-
eously by pulling a slide. The time of the speed counter was frequently
compared with the stop watch and adjusted so that the speeds given in
the following tests are undoubtedly correct, or at most, the errors are
small and extend over only a small number of readings.
The spring balance used in the tests with the strap brake was care-
fully recalibrated to tenths of a pound before using. A dash pot, in the
shape of a two inch brass pipe, eight inches long, closed at one end
in which a loosely fitting piston, connected by a rod on the brake strap,
moved in cylinder oil, with which the pipe was filled, was used to
steady the pointer on the spring balance. The piston and the rod were
made to weigh one pound when immersed in the oil. The application
of this dash pot completely stopped vibration of the spring balance and
accurate readings were made without difficulty.
With the pump properly oiled and packed, the pressure in the tank
never varied more than 0.2 of a pound either way from the desired
point The pressure tank was supplied with an ordinary water glass and
air cock. Preceding each test the tank was emptied of water and, the dis-
charge valve and air cock being closed again before starting the pump,
the air in the tank was forced to the top and served as a cushion to aid
in regulating the pressure.
A Lane pressure gauge was used, its readings being connected by
careful comparison with the Laboratory Standard Test Gauge made
also by the American Steam Gauge Co.
FRICTION TESTS OK THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN MOTOR.
In order to find the actual work done by the bucket it is of course
necessary to deduct the work done by the wheel in overcoming the
frictions of the journals and the air resistance of the wheel. In testing
the University of Michigan motor, the journal friction was measured by


a cord and dropping weight, and the journal friction and air resistance
combined were measured by a floating dynamometer in which the motor
was set and run at various speeds from very slow up to and beyond the
speed attained by the motor in actual use.
Fig. i, Plate III, from a photograph, shows the dynamometer with
the University of Michigan motor in position and connected as when mak-
ing a test.
The dynamometer consisted of two open, water tight boxes placed
one within the other and the space between them filled with sufficient
water to float the inner box. The inside measurement of the outer box
was 48" x 42" x 14", and the outside of the inner box was 42" x 36" x 12"
The outer box was lined inside with tin, to make it water tight and the
inner box was covered outside with tin, to keep the water out.
Inside the floating box was placed the motor with its shaft over the
center of the box. The floating box was brought and kept in a horizon-
tal position by means of weights fastened to its bottom, and this hori-
zontal position was determined by a spirit level placed upon a 36 inch
Darling, Brown and Sharpe steel rule, which was held in the upper end
of two upright pieces fastened to the side of the box. The steel rule
was graduated in soths of an inch and upon it by means of a wire hook
with an indicating point, was hung a weight of one-half a pound. This
weight was placed at some definite position, which was used as a zero
point and the weights in the bottom of the box, so adjusted as to bring
the scale beam exactly level. The motor was driven from an engine in
the experimental laboratory, by means of a small countershaft and a
Stow Flexible shaft It was found best to place the motor high up in
the floating box in order to increase its sensitiveness and thus make the
readings more accurate. It was also found necessary to close the opening
at the bottom of the motor and stop up the hole in the nozzle in order
to avoid variation in the air resistance.
In using the apparatus, the box was carefully balanced while the
motor was at rest and the small balance weight on the scale beam was
at the zero point; then the motor was started at as slow a speed as it
could be run uniformly and the balance weight moved far enough on
the beam to make the beam level again and the amount of this movement
and the speed recorded. The speed was then increased a little by raising
the governor valve of the engine, and the speed of the motor, and the
movement of the balance weight required to keep the beam level, again
while decreasing the speed until the slowest possible uniform speed was
recorded. This process was repeated until a speed as high as that ordi-
narily attained by the motor was reached; readings were then taken
while decreasing the speed until the slowest possible uniform speed was
reached.


Table 96 shows a friction test of this motor obtained by means of a
direct current motor in the electrical laboratory of the University of
Michigan. The method of conducting the test is the same as that used
in getting the friction of the Hug Water Wheel. Owing to a lack of
time the friction curves were not put in this article, but they can be
readily plotted from the data given in the above table.

The formulae by which these results were derived are as follows:
Let R = the revolutions per second.
L\ = the leverage of the dynamometer.
Wi = the weight on the journals during the dynamometer test
= 45 lbs.
Wi = the weight on the dynamometer arm = J4 lb.
r, = the radius of the journals = Vi inch.
F = the force of friction at the journals.
D = the distance, in feet, moved by the surface of the journals

The weights of the various parts of the University of Michigan
motor wheel are as follows:
LBS.
Weight of wheel alone 10.13
Weight of brake wheel 18.80
Weight of shaft 3.96
Weight of each bucket, bracket and bolt 24
Weight of each Pelton bucket 0665
Weight of each Trask bucket 154
Weight of each flat bucket 095
During this friction test the motor had on it 27 Pelton buckets,
which made the weight of the wheel 18.42 lbs. To get the total weight.
Wt on the journals the weight of one end of the Stow flexible shaft
must be added, but as this could not be determined exactly, and as it
was approximately 3.8 lbs., make it 3.82 lbs., which gives for the total
weight, Wt = 45 lbs. After the values of F D had been determined
according to these formulae they were plotted upon cross section paper
with the abscissas representing revolutions per second and the ordinates,
the work of friction, giving a friction curve from which the value of
F D for any given R can be determined. This curve is the upper line,
Curve 2, Plate VIII, and it represents both the journal friction and the air
resistance.
The slowest speed obtained by this method was thought to be too
high to measure the journal friction alone and another method was used
to determine it. For this purpose a cord was wound several times
around the shaft and to its end was fastened a weight, just great enough
to revolve the wheel slowly. The work done by the falling weight gave
the measure of the journal friction. The test was made by Prof. M. E.
Cooley, January 1, 1892, and the data is as follows:

This value of f is considerably higher than the value of / obtained

On May 31st, 1899, another test for journal friction of the University
of Michigan Motor was made by Mr. W. L. Cooper, the results of
which are given in Table 3. He made the test with a cord and weight
in a manner similar to that employed by Prof. Cooley. Before making
♦.he test, however, he "allowed the motor to run at its maximum speed
for half a nhour in order to insure its working under favorable condi-
tions." In a reduction similar to the one above he obtained / =: 0.0775
which agrees more closely with the results of the floating dynamometer
test than the first result.

Comparing Table I with the results derived from Tables 2 and 3
it seems safe to assume .07 as the value of / for the journal friction
and with W* = 45 lbs., this gives the value of Fi = 3.15 lbs.
In order to plot a diagram of the journal friction on the same scale
as for the total friction, the work of the journal friction was determined
by taking the same values for D as in Table 1. The lower curve in
Fig. 2, Plate VIII, shows this journal friction, and the ordinates between
the two curves measures the air resistance.
During the regular efficiency tests of the motor the weight on the
journals was greater, by the weight on the brake strap, than that during
the dynamometer friction test and it is necessary to increase the work
of friction, found from the friction curve, by the work due to this in-
crease of the weight on the journals.
THE TUERK MOTOR.
The first tests at the University of Michigan made upon water motors
of the hurdy-gurdy or jet reaction type were those made in the fall of
1889 by Mr. Louis C. Hill, now Supervising Engineer, United States
Reclamation Service, Phoenix, Arizona. The first tests made by Mr.
Hill were upon a 12-inch Tuerk Motor, and were conducted in the grain
elevator of Heinzeman and Laubengayer in the city of Ann Arbor. A
diagram drawing of a Tuerk motor and buckets with the ring nozzle used
is shown in Fig. 1, Plate V.
The water used was obtained from the city water works' mains
which furnished a practically uniform pressure. The motor was connected
to the supply pipe by a gate valve which controlled the supply of water,
the pipe being tapped near the motor to receive a connection to a Lane
pressure gauge. The discharge pipe was so arranged that the water
could either be turned to waste or turned into a tank for the purpose
of measurement, this tank being a barrel with a hole bored in the side
near the top to serve as an overflow. The amount of water held by the
barrel when filled to the overflow was found to be 388 pounds, so that
knowing this constant, the amount of water discharged per second was
readily determined by noting the time in seconds required to fill the
barrel to overflow. The water was measured two or three times during
each test and at other times was run to waste.
For measuring the work developed by the motor a simple strap
brake was used consisting of a % inch cord around a brake wheel 8
inches in diameter,—circumference 25.918 inches,—one end of the cord
being hung on a spring balance and to the other end fastened a rod on
which weights were placed. The friction of the cord on the circum-
ference of the brake wheel caused nearly all the load to be carried by the
wheel, a small part only being carried by the spring balance, and the

difference between the weights applied and the reading of the spring bal-
ance gave the net load on the brake.
The 12 inch Tuerk motor was supplied with a governor and in the
tests where this was used the quantity of water varied with each change
of load so that a water discharge reading and gross work calculation had
to be made in each run. This governor was of the fly-ball throttling
type, such that a movement of the balls outward forced a sharp conical
point into the orifice of the nozzle and this decreased the supply of
water. The nozzles of the Tuerk motor were of the ring type, being
merely a flat disc of brass about one-sixteenth inch thick, the inner
surface slightly concave, and having a sharp edged orifice in the center;
two sizes, $i inch and 7/16 inch orifice being used.
In the spring of 1892 tests of a six inch motor—sixteen buckets—
were made by Mr. John P. Keyes. These tests were conducted in the
experimental laboratory of the University of Michigan, the diagram in
Plate IV showing the general arrangement of the apparatus used, a
six-inch Tuerk motor furnished with a small Prony brake, replacing
the University of Michigan motor shown in that diagram, which is de-
scribed under the University of Michigan Motor. Two tests of the
wheel were made, one wth a pressure of 40 pounds per square inch on
the nozzle, another with a pressure of 60 pounds.
The reduction of the results of the tests on the Tuerk motors is
the same as that given following the Theory of the Impulse Wheel;
however, the final results obtained differ in character from those of other
wheels tested owing to the use of the ring nozzle. In the results given
by Mr. Hill and Mr. Keyes, the efficiencies obtained were those of the
combined mechanism of wheel, buckets, and nozzle, or what might be
termed the commercial efficiency of the motor complete. This charges
all loss of power through the nozzle directly to the wheel, and to deter-
mine the actual efficiency of the wheel it is necessary to correct for this
loss in the nozzle. Unfortunately the co-efficients of these nozzles were
not determined and there is not sufficient or accurate data to determine
their efficiency at this time. Reference is made, however, to results ob-
tained for square cap and ring nozzles in Experiments Relating to Hy-
draulics of Fire Streams by John R. Freeman, Trans. Am. Soc. C.
E., Vol. 31, p. 303, which are given in Table 4. The nozzles tested by
Mr. Freeman were larger than those used with the above motors, but the
ratios of diameters of orifice and play pipe are practically the same in
both cases. The cap of the nozzle in the Tuerk tests, however, was not
strictly a square cap, but the inner surface was rounded somewhat to-
ward the orifice as indicated in section in Fig. 1, Plate V. This un-
doubtedly tends to materially increase the discharge and the actual
co-efficient would be found between those given for the square cap and the
square ring nozzles, probably not far below the latter.

This uncertainty, however, prevents our giving the actual wheel
efficiencies, the above data being given that one may arrive at a rough
approximation of the actual efficiency of the wheel which will be some-
what higher than that obtained for the commercial efficiency. It is of
course impossible to obtain the bucket efficiencies for this motor from the
data given due to the uncertainty of the nozzle co-efficient and the lack
of friction tests of the wheel.
In the tests of the 12 inch motor with 7/16 inch nozzle, Mr. Hill
did not record the number of revolutions when running without load,
and the range of readings is also quite limited, making it difficult to trace
satisfactory curves.
Results of the tests of the 12 inch Tuerk motor are given in Tables
5 to 13 inclusive, those of the six inch Tuerk motor in Tables 14 and 15.

THE HILL BUCKET.
In the spring of 1890 while making the tests on impulse wheels, Mr.
L. C. Hill had constructed for the purpose of investigation a wheel
furnished with buckets of his own design. This bucket was formed of
two concave hemispheres intersecting each other a distance equal to
about one-eighth of the diameter of the hemisphere. The line of inter-
section formed a dividing edge similar to the Pelton but it was not as
sharp. The buckets were about the size of the buckets on an 18 inch
Pelton motor, and the wheel to which they were fastened was of right
size to make the total diameter equal to that of an 18 inch Pelton. The
wheel was tested in a Pelton case, replacing the regular wheel.
Mr. Hill left Ann Arbor before this wheel was completed but in
October, 1890, the class in experimental engineering under the direction
of Professor Cooley made a series of tests on the wheel at the plant on
Allen Creek, referred to below. The tests were quite unsatisfactory as
far as giving definite results are concerned, but were helpful in giving
suggestions to be followed in further experiments.
At first the faces of the buckets were radial and the wheel gave a
▼cry low efficiency. By putting a block under the front edge of each


bucket, between it and the wheel rim so that the faces of the buckets were
set back from the radial line, the efficiency was greatly increased, and
every change in the thickness of the blocks and hence of the face angle
of the bucket, made a decided change in the efficiency. Loosening the
nozzle flange and tilting the nozzle so that the jet struck the buckets in
different positions, also greatly changed the results.
The experiments on this wheel all indicated that to determine the
best condition for any given bucket it was necessary to test it on a
wheel capable of many different adjustments, and this led directly to the
design and construction of the University of Michigan motor.
FLAT BUCKETS.
In July, 1891, upon the completion o fthe University of Michigan
motor ,a series of tests was run by Mr. C. E. DePuy with that wheel
fitted with square edged flat vanes. These vanes were of brass, rectan-
gular, two inches wide and one inch high radially. Views of this bucket
attached to the motor are shown in Plate II. The appaartus used was
described under the University of Michigan motor and shown in Plate IV.
Preceding each test a series of runs with the wheel running at ap-
proximately the speed for maximum efficiency was made to determine the
position and inclination of the nozzle for the best performance of the
wheel. The combination of *nozzle angle, nozzle distance, and nozzle
height, thus determined, giving the best results, was then used for the
regular bucket test that followed. This practice has been continued for
all tests in which the University of Michigan motor has been used. Tables
16 and 17 give a typical series of runs for this purpose.
In computing the bucket efficiencies for the flat bucket, the friction
curve for the University of Michigan motor shown in Fig. 2, Plate VIII,
was used. As this curve was made from a test of the motor fitted with
Pelton buckets, however, a correction was necessary due to the difference
of the two forms of buckets. The difference in weight of the two buckets
is neglected as it amounts to only about one per cent of the total weight
of the wheel. Assume that the time the wheel will run by inertia is
directly proportional to the final speed attained by the motor. The aver-
age final speed of the motor in the tests with flat buckets is 722 R. P. M.
In the tests with Pelton buckets this average is 907.5 R. P. M. The
average length of time the motor ran by inertia when fitted with Pelton
* As explained in the description of the University of Michigan
motor, nozzle angle is the inclination of the nozzle to the horizontal;
nozzle distance is the horizontal distance from the end of the nozzle tube
to the center line of the wheel, and nozzle height is the vertical distance
from the center of the wheel to the center of the nozzle tube trunions.


47
35 seconds. From
we find that the motor fitted with Pelton buckets
buckets is 54 seconds; when fitted with flat buckets,
722x54
the proportion
907.5
if running at a final speed of 722 R. P. M., would run by inertia, 42.9
seconds. Assuming, then, that the friction of the motor is inversely pro-
portional to the length of time it runs by inertia, the readings taken from
42.9
the above curve should be increased for the flat buckets in the ratio .
35
This correction was used in obtaining the bucket efficiencies in the fables
for the Flat Bucket.
It is to be noticed that the efficiencies obtained for the flat bucket
fall below 50 per cent, though approaching that closely as the theoretical
maximum.
The results of these tests are given in Tables 18 to 21 inclustre.

THE PELT0N BUCKET.
The Pelton wheel was the earliest to be generally introduced. The
bucket is divided in the middle by a curved partition, the plane of whose
edge is perpendicular to the axis of the wheel. The Pelton bucket is
shown in Fig. 2, Plate VII, reproduced from a photograph of the wheel
of the 18" Pelton wheel used in the following tests. The water is dis-
charged from this bucket at the sides as distinguished from buckets ap-
proaching the hemisphere in form.
12-inch Pelton Motor.—In the summer of 1890 a series of tests was
conducted by Mr. L. C. Hill upon a 12-inch Pelton motor. The tests were
run under the same conditions and with use of the same apparatus as those
of the 12" Tuerk motor. The results of these tests are given in Tables
22 to 26 inclusive.
18-inch Pelton Motor.—Following the tests of the 12-inch Pelton
motor, a series of tests was made by Prof. M. E. Cooley and Mr. L. C.
Hill upon an 18-inch Pelton motor. These tests were conducted at the
testing plant on Allen Creek, mentioned above under the Hill Bucket. The
plant was situated on the culvert where Allen Creek crosses North Main
Street, Ann Arbor, a general arrangement of the apparatus of which is
given in Plate VI, from a photograph of the plant in operation. The
tank used for measuring the water discharged had a capacity of about
1,600 pounds, and being placed on a platform scale, the amount dis-
charged was weighed directly each time. The water was supplied to


the motors from an ordinary city fire hydrant through fifty feet of 254-
inch fire hose.
The nozzles of the 12-inch and 18-inch Pelton motors above were
conical at the entrance, ending in a tube of constant cross section, approx-
imately a standard tube.
All wheel efficiencies obtained for these two wheels have been cor-
rected for losses in the nozzle which in the original computation were
charged to the wheel, the efficiencies here given being obtained using the
velocity head at the tip of the nozzle as the effective head instead of that
indicated by the pressure at the base of the nozzle. Tables 27 to 37
inclusive contain the results of the tests of the 18" Pelton motor.

Friction Test 18" Pelton Motor.—On January 7, 1892, the class in
experimental engineering at the University of Michigan conducted a test
of the 18-inch Pelton motor above, to determine the work absorbed in
friction. These tests consisted of the floating dynamometer test and
falling weight test for journal friction, the same method and largely the
same apparatus being employed as that for the University of Michigan
motor, previously described. In the falling weight test, however, instead
of putting the cord around the shaft, it was wound upon the circumference
of the brake wheel. The results of these tests are given in Tables 38 and
39, and the curves are shown in Fig. 3, Plate VIII. The reductions were
made in the same manner as that given for the University of Michigan
motor, and having thus determined the work absorbed in friction, the
bucket efficiencies were obtained directly.
Pelton Buckets, U. of M. Motor.—In July, 1891, a series of tests
was made on the University of Michigan motor furnished with Pelton
buckets. These tests were conducted in the experimental laboratory of
the University of Michigan, the set up of all apparatus used being shown
in Plate IV, and fully described above under the University of Michigan
Motor. These results also have been corrected for loss through the
nozzle, giving the actual wheel efficiencies.
The bucket efficiencies were obtained by correcting for work absorbed
in friction as given under the friction tests of the University of Michigan
motor, also Fig. 1, Plate VIII. In the friction test, the wheel was fur-
nished with 27 Pelton buckets. In the efficiency tests above 24 and 30
Pelton buckets were used. It is quite probable that by increasing the
number of buckets on the wheel, thus bringing the buckets more closely
together, and in a way approaching the case of a smooth rim, the air
friction is decreased, and similarly by decreasing the number of buckets
the air friction is increased. However, the influence upon the journals
of the difference in weight of the buckets, added or deducted, quite prob-
ably will off-set the slight variation in air resistance, within narrow limits,
so that the results given are reasonably accurate for these tests.
The results for these tests of the University of Michigan motor fur-
nished with Pelton buckets are given in Tables 42 to 45 inclusive.
A single test of the University of Michigan motor furnished with
Pelton buckets was made in May, 1899, by W. L. Cooper, the results of
which are given in Table 46. Table 47 gives the results of another sim-
ilar single test made in May, 1901, by Ralph M. Myers, and Table 48 a
test run in June, 1896, by F. A. Eckert for comparison with the Cascade
wheel.
Six Inch Pelton Motor.—In the spring of 1892, along with three other
small wheels, Mr. J. P. Keyes tested a six inch Pelton motor in the ex-

perimental laboratory of the University of Michigan, using practically the
same apparatus shown in Plate IV, and described under the University
of Michigan motor. Fig. 3, Plate V, is a diagram of the wheel and nozzle
used.
Two tests were run under pressures at the base of the nozzle of 40
and 60 pounds. The wheel efficiencies are given corrected for nozzle
losses, the bucket efficiencies being omitted for lack of friction data. The
results are given in Tables 40 and 41.
It is quite evident that the small wheel under a medium head does not
attain high efficiencies.
A brief inspection of the results obtained with the University of
Michigan motor would show that the efficiency of the Pelton bucket in-
creases as the face angle of the bucket is increased from the radial line
up to 30°.

THE
BACKUS
MOTOR.
Tn
August,
1890, Prof. M.
E. Cooley conducted a series of tests on
an 18-inch Backus Motor at the testing plant on Allen Creek, Ann Arbor,
the tests being made in the same manner as those of the 18-inch Pelton
Motor. The results have been corrected for loss in the nozzle, and the
efficiencies given are the actual efficiencies of the wheel, using as the
effective head in computation the velocity head at the tip of the nozzle.
It would seem from an inspection of the results that the wheel
could not use economically all the water supplied to it through the H
inch nozzle under the higher heads of 210, and 161 feet, as in plotting
curves for these tests the points will be found to be very much scattered.
With a head of 114 feet with a fjj inch nozzle, and 161 feet with a %
inch nozzle, however, the points lie very nearly on a line.
Tables 49 to 52 inclusive give the results of these tests on the Backus
Motor.

THE DAYTON MOTOR.
In the spring of 1892 tests were made on two six-inch Dayton Motors,
designated as Dayton Motor No. 1, and Dayton Motor No. 2, by Mr.
J. P. Keyes. These tests were conducted in the experimental laboratory
of the University of Michigan following the same methods and with the
same apparatus used in the tests of the six-inch Pelton and six-inch
Tuerk Motors. Diagrams of these wheels showing sections of the buck-
ets and nozzles used are shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 4, Plate V.


67
The efficiencies given for the Dayton Motor No. 1, have been cor-
rected for loss through the nozzle so they appear as the actual efficiencies
of the wheel. The nozzle used with Dayton Motor No. 2, however, is
of a form possessing some characteristics of the ring nozzle and as there
is no data concerning this peculiar form, no corrections for discharge
have been attempted. The efficiencies given for the Dayton Motor No. 2,
therefore, are the commercial efficiencies, i. e., efficiency of the com-
bined bucket, wheel, and nozzle. The low efficiencies would indicate that
considerable loss of head occurs in this form of nozzle.
The results of the Dayton Motor tests are found in Tables 53 to 56
inclusive.

THE DEPUY BUCKET.
After leaving the University of Michigan, Mr. C. E. DePuy, who
had conducted the first tests on the University of Michigan motor, de-
signed and made a set of buckets according to ideas of his own. These
buckets were of a peculiar oval shape approaching a hemisphere and
were attached on either side of the rim of the wheel in pairs, alternating
in position similar to the arrangement of the buckets of a Cascade Wheel.
In place of the web of the Cascade Wheel, however, the inner edges of
the buckets formed the dividing edge. A view of the wheel of the Uni-
versity of Michigan motor furnished with DePuy buckets is given in
Fig. 1, Plate IX, which shows this arrangement and form of the bucket.
Unable to test them himself, Mr. DePuy sent the set to the Univer-
sity of Michigan where two series of tests were made, one in May, 1899,
by Mr. W. L. Cooper, and another in April, 1901, by R. M. Myers. Both
these series were conducted in the experimental laboratory of the Uni-
versity of Michigan, making use of practically the same apparatus as was
used by Mr. DePuy in l8gi, and shown in the diagram of Plate IV. A
photograph of the apparatus used by Mr. Myers in his test is reproduced
in Fig. 2, Plate III.
In Mr. Coopers tests a Gordon pump was used which with the aid
of the Curtis regulator maintained a practically constant pressure, the
variation being seldom more than 0.2 of a pound, a great deal of the
time there being no apparent variation whatever. This was partly effected
by pumping air into the tank to obtain a cushioning influence, the labora-
tory air pump being connected to the tank for this purpose.
The only detail with which any trouble was experienced was in get-
ting the tare. The strap brake with a dash pot was the form of brake
used. It was necessary to change the oil of the brake dash pot several
times, and even this did not resutl satisfactorily at all times in controlling
the eccentricities of the spring scale pointer. On beginning a test it was


69
necessary to run the motor for at least half an hour under a medium
load before the tare would become steady, but it would finally settle and
become fairly constant. In place of the revolution recorder described
under the University of Michigan motor, Mr. Cooper used a revolution
counter and split second stop watch, obtaining very accurate results.
The only change in the apparatus in the tests of Mr. Myers was
the use of a Prony brake and beam scale in place of the strap brake and
Chantillon spring balance, better results being obtained as a consequence.
Preceding each test, a series of runs was made to determine the
nozzle positions for best performance. In obtaining the best working
conditions there were always several positions of the nozzle which gave
approximately the same maximum results. Moving the nozzle back and
forth horizontally and changing the distance thus from the end of the
nozzle to the buckets, seemed to have no effect whatever, within the
limits of the nozzle manipulation.
The results given have been corrected for losses through the nozzle,
and the actual efficiencies of the bucket have been added, use being made
of the friction tests of the University of Michigan motor.
The tests of this bucket point to the conclusion that the efficiency of
this form would be a maximum when the bucket face was radial.
The results of the several tests on the DePuy buckets are found in
Tables 57 to 66 inclusive.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
THE CASCADE WHEEL.
r/f.2
Two series of tests are re-
corded on the Leffel Cascade
Wheel, one in May, 1896, by F.
A. Eckert, and another in the
spring of 1897, by Charles G.
Simonds, Jr.
On the Cascade Wheel the
buckets are placed alternately on
either side of a central wedge-
shaped web. This web continu-
ously bifurcates the jet and thus
avoids the breaking of the stream
at every bucket. It is a question whether or not the increased wetted
surface partially offsets the gain due to continuous bifurcation. Dia-
grams of this bucket are given in Fig. I, Plate X. The angle between
the sides of the web is about 15°. The cascade wheel showing the
arrangement of the buckets is given in Fig. 2, Plate IX.
The wheel tested by Mr. Eckert was eleven inches pitch diameter
and had thirteen buckets on each side of the web. Some tests were run
at the old plant on Allen Creek, where a J^-inch nozzle was used under
a velocity head of 182.58 feet, and others in the Experimental Laboratory
with a 54-inch Pelton nozzle and 72.02 velocity head. Fig. 2 shows
sections of the nozzles used in this test and also the attachment for the
pressure gauge which determined the heads at the nozzles.
The wheel was too large to be mounted in the case of the University
of Michigan motor, so a special case of Jjj-inch pine was made of such
size that it could be fastened by means of coach screws to the base of the
University of Michigan motor. The inside dimensions on a horizontal
plane through the center of the shaft were 7j£xl8j4 inches; height from
base to center of journals 15^ inches; distance from front face where
adjustable nozzle was attached to center of journals 12 7-16 inches. On
each side of the case was a window 6x7J4 inches. The journal boxes
were four inches long, of hard maple. To prevent them being affected
by water they were soaked in oil a few days, after which they were
bolted in place and lined up. The case was thoroughly varnished inside
with shellac.
The adjustable nozzle of the University of Michigan motor was
fastened to the wood case by means of four J^-inch bolts; so the adjust-


75
able nozzle angle, nozzle height, and nozzle distance was obtained in the
same manner as with the University of Michigan motor.
For the tests in the Experimental Laboratory the other apparatus
was the same as previously described and shown in Plate IV. Both
a strap brake and Prony brake were used in the preliminary tests, but
the Prony brake alone was used in the final tests by reason of its easy
manipulation. A spring balance accurately regraduated was used with
the brake. The diameter of brake wheel was 7.92 inches, and the tare
weight used was 1.3 pounds.
The tests by Mr. Simonds were conducted in the Experimental Lab-
oratory, using the same apparatus as above, the wheel being tested, how-
ever, in the University of Michigan motor case.
Two friction tests by falling weights were made by Mr. Eckert on
the Cascade wheel, the resulting coefficient of friction in both cases being
0.2475. On computing the bucket efficiencies, however, no account could
be taken of windage.
For the results of the tests on Leffel's Cascade Wheel refer to Tables
67 to 79 inclusive.

THE HUG BUCKET.
In the winter of 1904 a Hug Water Wheel was sent from Denver,
Colorado, to the University of Michigan to be tested by Prof. G. S. Wil-
liams. The wheel arrived about the middle of November, 1904, and it

Bucket is the stray power curve; the lower is the friction curve and gives
the total work absorbed by the wheel in friction.

was necessary to return it by the 20th of December. The short time
that the wheel was here and the fact that the hydraulic equipment of the
laboratory had not yet been completed made it impossible to run as
complete a test on the wheel as was desired. The tests were conducted
by Prof. G. S. Williams, Prof. H. C. Anderson, and L. A. Whitsit.
The wheel itself consisted of a rather heavy cast iron frame to
which were fastened twenty patented Hug buckets. Fig. 2, Plate X
shows the front elevation of the bucket and a vertical section through the
center. The jet of water impinges upon the flat, inclined surface of the
bucket and is divided by a sharp vertical edge into two return streams.
The lip edges of the bucket are made thin so there shall be as little
loss as possible from impact.
The experiments were run on the first floor of the hydraulic labora-
tory. A platform was erected about 6% feet above the floor, upon
which the water wheel was fastened. Near the other end of the plat-
form a pressure tank was located. This pressure tank was the same as
that used in preceding tests and shown in Fig. IV. The water and
power were obtained from the mains of the Ann Arbor Water Co. The
water came from the street to the laboratory through a 4" cast iron main.
It then passed through a No. 3 Crown Water Meter. From the meter
to the pressure tank and from the tank to the wheel the water passed
through a 3" wrought iron pipe. A pressure gauge was placed on the
three inch pipe near the wheel, but as will be seen later, the head was not
computed from the pressure, hence the pressure readings were only re-
corded occasionally. It would have been impossible to have obtained re-
liable results from the gauge readings because the pressure fluctuated to
such an extent.
Plate XI shows the arrangement of the apparatus. On the floor
directly beneath the wheel were placed the weighing tank and scales. To
one side of the weighing tank was the waste tank into which the water
was wasted, except when readings were being taken. At such times the
water went directly into the weighing tank.
The first arrangement that was adopted for these tanks proved to be
unsatisfactory. It was attempted to use the 4" pipe and the three-way
cock that Mr. DePuy and Mr. Eckert used for their waste lines. In
order to reach the waste duct in the floor it was necessary to place the
weighing tank about twenty feet away from the wheel. The water had
to go through about 25 feet of 4" pipe, through the three-way cock, and
turn one right angle before reaching the weighing tank, but when the
water was going to waste it had only to go through about 14 feet of pipe
and turn one right angle through the three-way cock. As a result of
this arrangement, although there was a good grade to the pipe, yet the
frictional head was appreciably less when the water was wasting into the


duct than when discharging into the weighing tank. This increase of
frictional head during weighing caused the water to back up in the
waste line and consequently the weight obtained was too small. Fortun-
ately, only a few runs had been made when this error was noticed and their
results were rejected. The effect of the error was seen by the fact that when
these results were worked out they gave an efficiency greater than unity.
As has been noted this same error may have been present in preceding
experiments. In these cases when the water was going to waste, it had
to turn a right angle through the three-way cock and then go through
a length of 4" pipe. When they were taking weight the water had only
to go directly through the three-way cock into the tank.
The means used in these experiments for changing the stream of
water from the weighing tank to the waste tank was a trough about s'-o"
long swung on a long radius in such a manner that when the water was
going to waste the diverter was in the middle of its swing. On account
of its long radius, but a small force was required to swing it out far
enough to allow the water to go directly from the wheel into the weigh-
ing tank. The diverter proved to be very effective as well as easily
handled. An ordinary watch was used to obtain the time. The observer
held the watch up before him in his left hand and with his right hand
manipulated the diverter.
A 1" nozzle was used during the entire experiments, except those
in Table 82, when a 1-5/16" nozzle was used. The pressure head varied
from 33 to 38 pounds per square inch when the 1" nozzle was used and
from 15 to 18 pounds per square inch when the 1-5/16" nozzle was used.
Actual measurements of the wheel give the following results: The
horizontal distance from the face of the nozzle to the vertical plane
through the center of the wheel, i. e., the nozzle distance is 7.672 inches.
The vertical distance from the center of the wheel to the center line
of the nozzle, or nozzle height, is 11.24 inches. The center line of the
nozzle was horizontal, i. e., nozzle angle zero. The bucket face angle was
17° S3'-
The wheel was running continuously during each experiment. The
weights on the scale beam were increased by increments of 2 or 3 pounds
until the speed for maximum efficiency was attained, then the increments
of weight were made smaller and several readings taken for each weight.
It was the object of the experiments, not to obtain the curves of efficiency,
but only to obtain the maximum values of the efficiency. Hence it will
be seen if curves are plotted that the lower portion of them have not
enough points to establish them very definitely.
The results of the test on the Hug Water Wheel are given in Tables
81 to 85 inclusive. The horse power column contains three items for each
run. The first item is the brake horse power, the second is the frictional


horse power, and the third is the total horse power developed and is
equal to the brake horse power plus the frictional horse power. In the
last column arc given the ratios of the velocity of the bucket to the
velocity of the jet for each run. This ratio for theoretical maximum
efficiency should be 0.5.
FRICTION TESTS.
The friction of the wheel was obtained by means of a 1 H. P. direct
current motor. The motor was first run alone and its stray power de-
termined for speeds varying from 1200 to 2350 revolutions per minute.
The stray power in watts was equal to the armature current in amperes
multiplied by the potential in volts between the armature terminals. The
motor was then connected by belt to the water wheel and was again run
at varying speeds from 500 to 2350 R. P. M. The R. P. M. of the wheel
and motor, the current in the armature, and the terminal potentials were
taken at each reading, from which it was possible to compute the amount
of energy absorbed by the wheel. The frictional data are given in
Table 80.
The following is the computation for one of the points on the fric-
tional horse power curve:
Speed of wheel, 500 R. P. M.
Speed of motor, 1490 R. P. M.
Ii, 3.18 amperes.
E«, 146 volts.
Heat lost, la ~R 27.50 watts.
Stray power, 178.7 watts (taken from curve).
Total power, 464.0 watts.
Power taken by friction of water wheel, 464—(27.50+i78.7)=257.8
watts .3456 H. P.
This friction curve is shown in Plate VIII.

THE DOBLE BUCKET.
In May, 1901, a set of ellipsoidal buckets was sent to the University
of Michigan by Mr. Doble to be used on the University of Michigan
motor. One test was run at that time by Mr. R. M. Myers, the results
of which are given in Table 86. Further tests were not made then for
lack of time, and the tests were not continued until the latter part of
April, 1906, when five supplementary tests were run for use in this paper,
see Tables 87 to 91, and the first of June when four more tests were
completed,—Tables 92 to 95. Preparations are being made for further
extensive tests on the Doble wheel and buckets and some interesting
results are expected. In addition to the tests run in 1906 a thorough
friction test was made upon the University of Michigan motor furnished
with 30 Doble buckets, the results of which are given in Table 96.
The ellipsoidal or Doble bucket is a double trough form having an
elliptical contour as shown in Fig. I, Plate XII. A photograph of the
wheel of the University of Michigan motor fitted with 30 Doble buckets
as used in the tests recorded in this paper is reproduced in Fig. 2, Plate
XII. For the theory after which the ellipsoidal bucket was designated,
see Tangenital Water Wheels by Mr. W. A. Doble, Trans. Am. Soc.
Mining Engineers, Vol. 29.
'The buckets made for the University of Michigan motor above were
constructed to be used with a V2 inch nozzle, and Mr. Doble stated that
the correct number of buckets for this size wheel to obtain efficiency is 25.
The first tests were run, however, with the wheel furnished with 30
buckets and using a H inch conical nozzle. The last series of tests, the
results of which are recorded in Tables 92 to 95, was made with the wheel
furnished with 25 buckets and with the use of a V2 inch conical nozzle,
being the conditions given above for maximum efficiency.
The test by Mr. Myers was made with the apparatus shown in Fig. 2,
Plate III. The apparatus employed in the tests made in 1906 differed in
some respects from that used previously. With a Gordon pump water
was taken from the north canal of the hydraulic laboratory and pumped
into the compression tank used in all previous tests. The pump was set
on the mezzanine floor of the laboratory and the compression tank sus-
pended beneath the floor above. The motor was mounted on a temporary
platform built on a level with the mezzanine floor over the south canal,
so that water from the wheel could be discharged directly into the canal
below. Below the platform the canal was planked over and an iron
weighing tank on platform scales placed directly beneath the wheel. The
diverter used in the test of the Hug Water Wheel was mounted in a


95
manner similar to that shown in Plate XI, so that when the diverter
hung in its natural position water was wasted from the wheel into the
canal at one side, and when the diverter was swung out, the wheel dis-
charged directly into the weighing tank below. During the first two tests
a length of ordinary 2^ inch fire Hose was used to bring the water from
the compression tank to the wheel, and under the high pressure there
was so much leakage throughout the whole length of the hose that it
was replaced by a 2" iron pipe for the other tests, connection to the nozzle
of the motor being made by a three-foot length of 2j4 inch fire hose. The
only pressure regulation was the air cushion in the tank, but the variation
was seldom more than a pound, and as these pressures were not used
in computation this variation was of no consequence. The water dis-
charged was weighed continuously throughout each test and these meas-
urements were used in determining the velocity heads used in computing
the results.

It would seem from the above results that the efficiency of the Doble
Buckets is comparatively low but this is probably due to the fact that they
were not in the position of maximum efficiency. The time given to these
tests did not permit of more extensive investigations.

* It would seem from above results that the efficiency of the Doble
Bucket is comparatively low but this is probably due to the fact that cither
the face angle of the bucket, or the inclination of the impinging jet, or
both, were not in position for maximum efficiency. The time given to
these tests did not permit of more extensive investigations.

ADDENDA
With the coming year will be introduced the new department in
architecture with Professor Lorch at the head, thus making six dif-
ferent engineering courses given at the University: Mechanical, electri-
cal, civil, marine, chemical, and architectural.
The Engineering Society this year has passed through the most pros-
perous period of its history, the membership now consisting of over two
hundred students. The membership committee of the first semester of
which Mr. Nagelvoort was chairman did some very effective work in
the way of obtaining new members, which goes to show that this is a very
important committee and only those men should be appointed to it who
show an active interest in the welfare of the society.
On Friday evening, March 23, occurred the sixteenth annual banquet
of the Engineering Society, at the Cook House. It was as usual a most
pleasant event. The banqueters were addressed by several members of
the society and also had the good fortune to have with them Dean Cooley,
Professors Allen, Patterson and Mr. T. H. Hinchman, consulting engin;
eer of Detroit. The idea of getting some out-of-town alumnus to give
an address at the banquet is a new one this year and it seems would be
an advisable one to follow out hereafter.
The Technic is in receipt of a copy of Doble Tangential Water
Wheels, published by the Abncr Doble Co. The book is profusely illus-
trated with different set-ups also showing in detail the Doble Ellipsoidal
bucket and needle regulating nozzle which in some cases records as high
as 99.3% efficiency. The back of the book contains convenient tables on
weir measurements, water wheels, losses of head by pipe friction, etc.
We have also received a copy of the Business of Contracting by
Ernest McCullough. Mr. McCullough takes up the subject under the
heads of Staff, Manager, Superintendent and Foreman in the first two
chapters; the third and fourth are devoted to Making Bids, and the rest


of the book on Working Methods. Mr. McCullough has had broad ex-
perience along the line of construction work and the book is full of many
practical hints and much sound advice on what to do and what not to do.
Early in the present semester members of the senior class of the
marine department organized the Indoor Yacht Club. Only fourth year
students are admitted to the club. The object of the club is both social
and instructive and was originated particularly to obtain information
regarding the design and construction of small pleasure craft.
A constitution and by-laws were formulated and the following offices
created:—Commodore, Captain, Mate, Purser, and Engineer.
In the matter of increasing The Technic from a semi-annual to a
quarterly publication, no material gain seems to have been made this
year. However, we can say this much, that so far our efforts have dis-
covered what not to do and from what experience we have had can
point to a plausible solution of the problem, or at least offer suggestions
to be acted upon by those to act as editors in the future.
The present subscription list should be maintained and additions to
it encouraged, but the greater effort should be made to secure advertisers.
The advertising rates if changed to $10 per page per issue or $40.00
per year, would amply publish the quarterly; and as we pointed out in
the last issue The Technic is a most desirable medium of advertising
and the above rate would be very reasonable. We might state here, for
example, the quarterly published by Harvard University, in no way su-
perior either in quality or quantity of material to The Technic and with
a smaller number of books published receive $60.00 per page for adver-
tising.
In regard to the work to be done it seems as if it would be asking
too much of the student to do this gratis. If the managing editor and
business manager were paid a reasonable sum for their services, or if
this work were placed in the hands of some one of the instructors of the
department as a chief with the rest of the editors acting in lesser roles,
doing proof reading or similar work as is also done by some other tech-
nical university publications it might be a step in the right direction.
Hoping the new board will work out the proper solution of the problem,
either as suggested or by some other means the present editors extend to
them thir sincere hopes for success.

THE REAL QUESTION
About Concrete Mixers
When Ordering a
Mixer
for making concrete, mortar,
pulp, briquettes, block fuel, or
any other requirement, the im-
portant question is—will it pro-
duce a perfect product?
Failing in this any other fea-
ture* of claimed excellence are
unworthy of consideration.
It stands to reason that con-
crete machines having for mix-
ing devices, paddles, scoops, shelves, or blades attached to the inside of the periphery of
the mixing receptacle merely pocket as much as they will hold of some ingredient as
it enters the chamber and carry it around, cutting through but not mixing with the
main nuxss of material at the botom of the receptacle, and this ingredient, carried by
these devices, is not removed, or mixed, but simply slides out when the batch is dis-
charged.
The inevitable result is an imperfectly mixed, inferior quality concrete.
In trough miners provided with spirals, the materials are merely pushed aUmu in
layers, and any distribution of cement that may be done is accomplished by the uncer-
tain action of water.
The Chicago Improved
Cube Concrete Mixer
has no inside scoops or paddles,—nothing but breaker rods, with an interior absolutely
smooth and free from complicated mechanism.
At 1H revolHtions a minute the entire contents of the cube are thrown t&gt;ack and
forth and broken over the breaker rods SO times,—a more thorough mixing than is
secured by any other mixer.
There are no pockets, scoops or blades to separate the ingredients.
The breaker rods break up any possible lumps or masses in the material, and it is
impossible for ingredients to adhere to them,—no possibility of bailing up or flogging,—
the entire batch must be evenly mixed Insuring perfect concrete.
As a mortar mixer it has no equal.
It is the only mixer which can he dumped by the same power that operates the
machine. We control all patents covering this device. There are no inside* to clean,
and no paddles, scoops or shelves to clog, wear out and get out of order. It requires less
power to operate than any other mixer, consequently uses less fuel and requires less
labor.
The "Chicago" has fewest number of jtarts, requires leu* time to mix, ami insures
absolute, uniformity of concrete. Sizes and mountings for every equipment. Write for

ISRAEL COOK RUSSELL
William H. Hobbs.
Professor Israel Cook Russell, whose lamented death has suddenly
terminated a service of more than fourteen years at the University of
Michigan, was distinguished for his indomitable energy and dauntless
courage, for his keen perception and breadth of view in interpreting
observations, and for the grace of a literary style which permitted him
to interest and charm his readers and listeners. He was one of the
greatest of American geological explorers, and with perhaps a single
exception our most successful popularizer of the science. Never more
happy than when amid the dangers of Alaskan exploration he essayed
to scale the heights and wrest from the realm of the unknown its secrets,


he was accustomed upon his return to civilization to shut himself in his
study to reflect upon and prepare for others the knowledge gained in
the field.
Born December 10, 1852, at Garrattsville, N. Y.. he lived for twelve
years in that vicinity, and spent the remainder of his boyhood days at
Plainfield, N. J. The departments of geological investigation which he
later made his own are all especially well illustrated by the scenes among
which his boyhood was passed—the topographic forms of a glaciated
country, the characteristics of complexly faulted regions, and the Triassic
or Newark formation for which he later assembled the scattered litera-
ture and furnished the generalizations. He studied at the Rural High
School at Clinton, N. Y.; the Hasbrook Institute at Jersey City; the
University of the City of New York, and the School of Mines of Colum-
bia University. The University of the City of New York conferred upon
him the degrees of B.S., and C.E. (1872), and the honorary degree of
Doctor of Laws.
Few American geologists have enjoyed equally good opportunities
for observing geological phenomena in their varied aspects. Almost
immediately after completing his Universty studies, Professor Russell
visited New Zealand and Kerguelen Island as a member of the U. S.
Transit of Venus Expedition of 1874. In 1878 he was the companion
of Professor J. J. Stevenson in geological exploration in New Mexico
for the U. S. Government Surveys west of the 100th meridian. The
year 1879 was spent in European travel. In 1880 he became the assistant
to Mr. G. K. Gilbert, one of the most distinguished of American geolo-
gists, and for five years, most of the time independently, he studied the
Great Basin region of the western United States. From 1885 to 1888
he was engaged in the study of the geological structure of the Southern
Appalachians and in reconnaissance work along the entire Atlantic border
of the United States.
In 1889 Professor Russell engaged in exploratory work along the
eastern boundary of northern Alaska for the U. S. Coast and Geodetic
Survey, and during two succeeding summers explored the slopes of Mt.
St. Elias under the joint auspices of the U. S. Geological Survey and the
National Geographic Society. After his call in 1892 to the chair of
geology at the University of Michigan his summers were occupied by
studies made in various parts of the State of Michigan for the State
Geological Survey, but more often in the region of the Cascade Mountains
of Washington, Oregon and Idaho for the U. S. Geological Survey. In
1002, after the grand eruptions of the West Indian volcanoes, he was
a member of the scientific expedition of the National Geographic Society
to the scenes of the disasters.
This wide first-hand observational knowledge of North America spe-


cially qualified Professor Russell to discuss the geography of the con-
tinent. His popular writings upon the subject comprise five volumes,
four of which he has described as "Reading Lessons for Students of
Geography and Geology." These works treat respectively of the rivers,
lakes, glaciers, and volcanoes of North America. The fifth volume is
entitled "North America," and is a general treatise which more particu-
larly discusses the relations of North American geography to man and
to his activities. Professor Russell's published writings number in all
124 titles.
The recognition of Professor Russell's ability and of his eminence
as a geologist brought him many honors, and though he doubtless appre-
ciated them he appeared never to seek them, being by nature modest and
devoid of ostentation. He served as Vice-President of the American
Association for the Advancement of Science to represent the section
for geology and geography, as President of the Michigan Academy of
Science, and as President of the Geological Society of America. The
first draft of what was to have been his annual address before the Geo-
logical Society had been prepared before his death, and extracts from
it were read at the recent meeting of the society in New York.
Those who knew Professor Russell intimately esteemed him for his
rare personal charm and for a modesty which by others was sometimes
mistaken for diffidence. Inclined to quiet which was at times almost
taciturn, his few remarks came as peculiarly apt and often epigrammatic
expressions or as bright flashes of humor. As a citizen he was highly
esteemed and gave generously of his time and from his store of expert
knowledge without a thought of compensation.
The geological department of the University of Michigan is to per-
petuate his name in its seminary room, and students of the department
will have free access to the valuable books and maps which he collected
for his private library, and which through the generosity of Mrs. Russell
are now its property. The excellent portrait which occupies a con-
spicuous place in the room will recall to older students the handsome,
dignified and kindly features, and the slight but well-knit figure which
gave so little indication of the sustained endurance of which it was
capable. In mountain exploration Professor Russell was an untiring
traveler, surpassing all the mountajneers of his carefully selected parties;
and when at home he labored at his desk unceasingly, spurred on by an
interest which never flagged, though it brought fatigue which perhaps
contributed to make him an easier prey of the disease which carried him
away. This mental lassitude he occasionally voiced by the expression,
"I wish I could stop thinking." His loss is one not alone to the com-
munity in which he lived, but to the great country which he did so much
to explore, and to students of geology everywhere.


A TREATISE ON THE PATENT LAW
Copyright, 1906
Frank J. Seabolt, B.S., '97. LL.B.
PREFACE
In presenting this treatise the writer has endeavored to set forth
in a condensed and comprehensive form a few of the underlying prin-
ciples of the patent law, having in mind the needs of a large body of
engineers and inventors to whom a general knowledge of patents will
be of service, but who have neither the time nor the disposition to con-
sult the more elaborate and complete writings on the subject. Certain
branches of the patent law, a knowledge of which would seem to be of
especial importance to the engineer, have been dealt with in some detail,
while other branches, which chiefly concern the patent attorney or solici-
tor, have been touched upon lightly. Recent decisions on questions in-
volving the more important aspects of the subject have been examined
and noted where deemed advisable, while such works as Walker, Curtis,
and Robinson on Patents have been freely consulted. The subject dealt
with is an exceedingly complex one, but it is hoped that the following
pages will make clear some of its more important features, as well as
correct some of the popular misconceptions.

definition and subject matter of a patent
Under the common laws which came into being in the middle ages in
England an inventor had no special right to his invention. New and
useful inventions were seldom produced in those days and, although
despotic kings oftentimes conferred monopolies upon their favorites, and
in sonic cases these monopolies were extended to inventors for their
inventions, it was not until the reign of James I that the English Parlia-
ment laid the foundations of the patent laws by limiting the granting of
monopolies to cases of inventors. This statute did not, however, purport
to confer any right which might be made absolute by legal proceedings,
but simply recognized the power of the king to secure such right to an
inventor, if he so desired.
In the United States of America, the right of an inventor to his in-


vention has a foundation in the consent of the people, the constitution
having in Article I, Section 8, conferred upon Congress the power
"to promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing
for limited terms to authors * and inventors the exclusive right
to their respective writings and discoveries."
The first federal statute was enacted in exercise of this power on the ioth
of April, 1790, and provided that the exclusive right to an invention be
secured to an inventor by means of a written grant from the United
States, such grant to be known as Letters Patent.
Letters Patent, as now contemplated, constitute a contract and the
rights thereunder are property of which the owners cannot be deprived
without due process of law. The inventor gives his invention to the
public in consideration of the right to make, use and vend the same for
a term of seventeen (17) years. The patent right is absolute, and,
during the term of his patent, a patentee may prevent others from making,
using and selling his invention, even though he does not wish to exer-
cise his rights himself.
Prior to the Patent Act of 1870, which is now in force, a patent
could not be granted to an alien, although various statutes were enacted
up to this time extending the privilege to aliens under certain conditions,
but under the above mentioned act our patent statutes apply as well
to an alien as to a citizen of the United States.
Patent rights, being intangible, properly cannot be sold under the
authority of any writ of "fieri facias" or other common law execution,
but may be reached by a creditor's bill in equity and applied to the pay-
ment of the owner's debts. Moreover, the Government has no more right
than a private citizen to make, use, or sell a patented invention without
the consent of the patentee.
Section 4886 of the R. S. provides that a patent may be
"obtained by any person who has invented or discovered any
new and useful art, machine, manufacture, or composition of
matter, or any new and useful improvements thereof,''
and, while it is not necessary that an inventor shall know to which
class his invention belongs, provided he knows that it is one or the other,
a few preliminary observations as to how the courts and text writers
view them will not be amiss. The word discovery as above used docs
not enter into the constitution or the statutes in its broadest signification.
It simply means invention. Principles or laws of nature may be discov-
ered, but they cannot be invented, although when discovered they may
be utilized or embodied in an invention.


An art in the sense of the patent law means little more or less than
a process, which latter has been defined as "an operation performed by
rule to produce a result." In Corning vs. Borden, is Howard, 267, where
the invention was for "improvement in the process of manuafcturing
iron," the case turned on the question whether or not a process which
consists only in the use of machinery was patentable . It was held that
it was not, and the statement by the court that
"it is well settled that a man cannot have a patent for a function
of a machine"
is today looked upon as embodying the law on that subject. The defini-
tion of process given above, therefore, must be limited to an operation
performed by means not solely mechanical.
Where an invention is not a mere function or mode of operation,
but is embodied in a mechanism designed to accomplish a particular
effect, it is a machine. As stated by Justice Heath in Boulton vs. Bull,
2 Hen. Blackstone, 492—
"When a mode of doing a thing is referred to something per-
manent, it is properly termed an engine; when to something fugi-
tive, a method;"
meaning that a machine has been invented when mechanism has been
constructed which does something in a particular way, and that a
method or process has been invented when the mode of doing a thing
has been devised that is capable of being carried out by various mechan-
isms not necessarily permanent. A machine has been defined as
"a combination of moving mechanical parts adapted to receive
motion and to supply it to the production of some mechanical
result or results."
MANUFACTURE.
The term "manufacture" as used in the statutes means "something
made by the hand of man" and has been extended so as to include every
object upon which art or skill can be exercised, and in this broad inter-
pretation it includes a process. When the term "art" was placed in the
statutes to embrace those cases where the invention consisted in the
mode or process of making or applying the article to use, the term "man-
ufacture" came to include only the article itself, or, as it is known
today, the article of manufacture.


COMPOSITION OF MATTER.
This class includes medicines and compositions used in the arts and
other combinations of substances intended to be sold separate. The test
of novelty is not whether the constituent materials are new, but whether
the combination is new.
DESIGNS.
Any new, original and ornamental design for an article of manu-
facture may be patented with the same reservations as to prior knowledge
and use as in the case of mechanical patents. The design law was only
intended to protect articles which depend for their novelty upon their
appearance. As stated in Rowe vs. Blodgett &amp; Clapp Co., 50 C. C. A. 120,
"Design patents refer to appearance, not functional utility, and
their object is to encourage works of art and decorations which
appeal to the eye, to the esthetic emotions, and to the beautiful.
The term "useful" in relation to design means adaptation to
producing pleasant emotions."
Prior to May 9, 1902, when the design law was amended, many
patents were issued for articles which were new as to shape and con-
figuration but in which functional utility and not beauty predominated.
Parts of machines, and in some instances, whole machines, were covered
by design patents, the question of beauty, which was originally intended
to be controlling, never being considered.
The amended design law as now laid down in R. S. 4929-4933 makes
it clear that appearance is controlling and that a picture of the article
together with a claim for the article as shown constitute all that is neces-
sary or desirable for a specification. The mere fact that an article may
have functional utility will not prevent its being patented as a design,
provided it is ornamental and complies with the other statutory require-
ments. (Mygatt vs. Zalinski et al., 138 F. R. 88.) The design itself,
however, is not founded upon that utility.
Design patents are granted for terms of three and one-half, seven
and fourteen years, as the applicant may elect.
HOW OBTAINED.
Procedure.
The inventor files a specification setting forth the invention in such
"full, clear, concise and exact terms as to enable any person
skilled in the art or science to which the invention appertains or
with which it is most nearly connected to make use of the same."


It must be accompanied by drawings, when required, and an affidavit
setting forth that the inventor
"does not know and does not believe that the invention was
ever known or used before his invention or discovery thereof;
or patented or described in any printed publication in any coun-
try before his invention or discovery thereof for more than two
years prior to this application; or patented in any foreign coun-
try on an application filed by himself or his legal representatives
or assigns more than twelve months prior to this application;
or in public use or on sale in the United States for more than
two years prior to this application; and that no application for
patent on said improvements has been filed by him or his repre-
sentatives or assigns in any foreign country."
What the applicant regards as his invention must be distinctly set forth
in claims which are annexed to and form a part of the specification, and
it is upon these claims, which are construed in connection with the speci-
fication, that the value of the patent depends.
The specification is examined in the Patent Office to see that it com-
plies with the statutes as regards clearness, exactness, etc., and if in-
formalities exist the applicant is called upon to amend. The claims
are then taken up and examined, first as to form and then as to novelty.
If the Examiner finds that the combination set forth in any of the claims
is anticipated in a prior patent, the claim is rejected and the applicant is
furnished with a memorandum of the patent. The applicant may then
amend by either modifying the claim so as to avoid the reference, by
rewriting it, or by cancelling the claim altogether. He must amend
within one year under the statutes now in force; otherwise the applica-
tion becomes abandoned. When the application is in suitable form and
the claims appear to be allowable, the patent is issued granting to the
inventor (or his assignee) for a term of seventeen (17) years in case
of mechanical patent, or for three and one-half (3V2), seven (7), or
fourteen (14) years in case of design patents, the exclusive right to
make, use and sell the invention covered thereby.
% Interferences.
A discussion of the subject of patents, even in the limited way in
which the matter is herein taken up, would hardly seem complete without
at least a brief discussion of one of the most important features of the
patent practice from the solicitor's standpoint, 1. e., interferences.
An interference is a proceeding instituted within the Patent Office
for the purpose of determining the question of priority of invention be-
tween contemporary applicants claiming the same invention.
Where two applications are pending concurrently in the Patent Office
and one of the applications is ready for allowance, the Patent Office


declares an interference in order to determine to which of the alleged
inventors the patent shall issue. The parties are notified as to the claims
in controversy and a preliminary statement is called for to be sealed and
filed in the Patent Office on or before a fixed date. This statement is
under oath and sets forth the earliest date of conception and disclosure
of the invention to others; the date on which a drawing was first made;
the date on which a model was first made; the earliest date on which
the invention was reduced to practice; the extent to which the invention
has gone into use; and the dates and numbers of any foreign patents
which may have been issued covering the invention. These statements
should be carefully prepared, as the applicant is not allowed to attempt
to prove any date earlier than those set up in the statement. These
statements are opened on a fixed day in the Patent Office and the inter-
ference is formally declared.
Times are set for the taking of testimony to substantiate the dates
alleged and a day for a final hearing set before the Examiner of Interfer-
ences. The last party to file his application has the burden of proving
his case against his opponent by a preponderance of evidence, excepting
in the case where one party had obtained a patent before the other party
filed, in which case the applicant must prove his case beyond a reasonable
doubt. After a patent has been issued two years an interference will
not be declared with a pending application. Where an interference is
declared between a patent which has already issued and an application
and the applicant prevails, the patentee cannot be deprived of his patent,
but a second patent will be issued to the applicant, the first one being
invalid.
In the proving of dates in an interference, sketches, drawings, mod-
els, etc., are relied upon and witnesses are examined to identify them. It
is, therefore, important that an inventor should preserve all of the evi-
dence of his invention and see that the drawings and model are wit-
nessed and dated.
Priority of invention is decided in favor of the party who first
completed his invention, »'. e., the party who was the first to reduce the
invention to practice. The only exception to this is where one party
conceived the invention first and was exercising diligence in perfecting
his invention when the other party entered the field. (Reed vs. Cutter,
i Story 590. Christie vs. Seybold, C. D. 1893.) The filing of an appli-
cation is looked upon as a constructive reduction to practice, while the
making of the device in operative form is an actual reduction to practice.
The rule above stated is a broad one, and, while it always applies,
the situation is usually otherwise complicated, ,so that it may be said
that the decision will depend upon the dates of conception, drawing,
model, disclosure, reduction to practice and filing of application. The


question of laches is likewise a very important element in determining the
question.
The interference proceedings are carried on in accordance with the
practice in Federal Courts and are of too complicated a nature to be ad-
vantageously dealt with herein at length. Suffice it to say, therefore,
that the testimony is transmitted to the Patent Office where a decision
is rendered in accordance with the law and the evidence. An appeal
may be taken from the decision of the Examiner of Interferences to the
Board-of-Examiners-in-Chief, from this tribunal to the Commissioner of
Patents, and finally to the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia.
Bars.
In considering the bars to the grant of a patent, it will be convenient
to consider them under two headings: first, those which are usually
raised in the Patent Office and constitute the conditions precedent or
prc-requisites; and, second, those which are raised after the grant and
which may be set up to invalidate same or conditions subsequent. This
classification is convenient for the reason that the Office generally has
no way of knowing that the bars of the second class exist, although they
would be just as effective before the grant as after.
The bars which are usually raised by the Patent Office to the grant
of a patent are:
1. Lack of novelty.
2. Lack of invention.
3. Lack of utility.
4. Inoperativeness of invention.
Of these, the first two are by far the most common, although it is not
uncommon to question the operativeness of an invention. The question
of utility, which at one time was considered of importance, is today prac-
tically a dead letter. The question of novelty is usually one of fact.
while the matter of invention may be said to be one of opinion, although
well defined rules have been laid down by the courts to cover certain
cases.
Novelty.
It is sometimes said that a thing may be new in a general sense and
still be old in the sense of the patent law. In all of such cases the rea!
question is one of invention and not of novelty, and it may, therefore,
be said that a thing that is really new is new as viewed in patent law.
Any prior patent or printed publication which discloses the invention
with sufficient fullness to enable any person skilled in the art or science
to which the invention relates to make or use the same is a bar to the


grant of a patent thereon. If the question of identity is raised, it will
be either one of fact as to whether or not there is a difference or it will
involve the question of invention.
A prior private patent granted in a foreign country or a public
patent granted in England, the complete specification of which was not
filed until after the applicant made his invention, is not a bar. A printed
publication, as above referred to, includes anything that is printed and
exposed for sale or distribution. A drawing alone is sufficient, if it
clearly discloses the invention. If an application has been filed in this
country and abandoned it docs not operate as a bar.
Any prior unpublished drawings do not act as a bar, no matter how
clearly they disclose the invention, nor does a prior model embodying the
invention, since to know or use a model or drawing is not the same as
to know or use the article itself. Moreover, the public may never get
the benefit of the invention disclosed by the drawing or model. A prior
unsuccessful abandoned experiment with the invention is not a bar, al-
though this rule is subject to some explanation and qualifications, as here-
inafter noted. ,
The fact that every part of an alleged invention is old does not nec-
essarily act as a bar to the grant of a patent thereon, and patents for
new combinations of old devices are very common. The question usually
raised is whether or not there is any invention in the new combination.
An invention should date, not from the time of its conception in the
mind of the inventor, but from the date when it was first embodied in
such a form that it is useful to the public. Moreover, to allow the in-
vention to date from the time of conception would be a strong tempta-
tion to perjury.
That questions of novelty arc questions of fact and not of law has
been settled by the Supreme Court in the early case of Bischoff vs.
Wethcred, 9 Wallace, 812, and the burden of proving lack of novelty
rests upon him who avers it.
Utility.
The question of utility of an invention is, as before stated, seldom
raised today, and the law on the subject has undergone a decided change
since the early decisions on the question were handed down. The early
decisions stated that utility is lacking from all processes and devices
which cannot be used to perform their specified function (Bliss vs. Brook-
lyn, 10 Blatch., 522), but today such inventions would be rejected on the
ground of inoperativeness of the invention. In a sense the terms mean
the same thing, since a thing which is inoperative is useless. If a device
performs its functions only imperfectly, it may still be useful, since it is
susceptible of improvement. A patent may be granted for a thing which


possesses no other utility than that of being decorative, since it is useful
in that it gives pleasure and happiness. A device which performs a
function which is injurious to the morals, health or good order of so-
ciety is useless in the sense of the patent law, as, for instance, an im-
provement in the art of forgery, and the better it performs its function
the more objectionable it will be. It may be said, however, that the rule
is that anything is useful if it can be used to accomplish a good result.
Questions of utility, like questions of novelty, are questions of fact,
and all doubts thereon should be resolved in favor of the inventor.
INVENTION.
Questions of invention are questions of combined law and fact, and
volumes might be written on this troublesome question which is every
day raised both in the Patent Office and the courts. For the purpose
of this treatise it is thought that the question can best be approached by
setting forth a few of the most clearly defined ideas as to what invention
is not.
To produce a device which any skilled mechanic would produce if
required is not invention, since something more than ordinary mechanical
or engineering skill must be shown. Nor is it invention to produce a
device which differs from the earlier device only in the excellency of its
workmanship. The mere substitution of superior for inferior materials
does not constitute invention, unless a new result is obtained which is
not due to the known properties of the substituted material or where the
excellency of the material could not be konwn beforehand.
A change of degree of a thing is not invention, as in the well-known
case of Guidit vs. Brooklyn, 105 U. S., 552, where paving stones of a
certain shape with rough faces were substituted for stones of the same
shape having faces which were less rough.
To enlarge a machine or strengthen it so as to enable it to operate
upon larger materials is not invention.
An aggregation of elements is not an invention. The most famous
case on this point is Reckendorfer vs. Faber, in which a patent for a
lead pencil having a soft rubber tip was declared invalid for want of
invention. The elements must so cooperate as to produce a new result
by their joint action or produce an old result in a new way. The ele-
ments need not act simultaneously, but there must be such cooperation
that the operation of each is modified by or dependent upon the other.
It is not invention to duplicate the parts or elements of a combina-
tion where no new function is produced by their cooperation, nor is
there invention in omitting an element where the function of the ele-
ment is likewise omitted and no new method of operation results.
There is no invention involved in substituting for an clement of a


combination an equivalent element. Of course, much depends upon the
definition of "equivalent" and an accurate statement of just what con-
stitutes an "equivalent" is extremely difficult. Broadly stated, however,
two elements may be said to be equivalents if they perform the same
function in substantially the same way. The doctrine of equivalents comes
to be of more importance in connection with infringements, and will
be more fully treated of under that head.
The application of an old device or process to a new purpose is not
invention, nor to merely change the form of a thing without producing
a new result.
INOPERATIVENESS OF INVENTION.
The question of inoperativeness of invention is more or less akin
to that of utility, for the reasons before stated. To show that a device
is inoperative it must usually be shown that it will not operate at all.
The question sometimes arises, however, as to whether or not a device
is operative in the sense of the patent law if it sometimes operates. The
determination of this question will depend somewhat upon the nature of
the machine and the device in which it is to be used. The requirements
of many machines are so exacting that a single failure to operate woiild
render them worthless, while other machines might often fail without
serious results. The fact, however, that a machine operates imperfectly
will not render it inoperative.
OWNERSHIP.
The application having been duly accepted and allowed by the Pat-
ent Office, the invention is in condition to be patented. The patent may
issue to:
r. The inventor.
2. The assignee of the inventor.
3. The inventor and assignee jointly.
Probably the majority of patents issue to the inventor himself, al-
though it is common for the inventor to assign his invention before the
granting of the patent by an instrument in writing filed in the Patent
Office. The inventor having filed an affidavit setting forth that he be-
lieves himself to be the originator of the invention set forth in the appli-
cation, the Patent Office does not concern itself further with the question
of real inventorship. This question is, however, frequently raised as a
bar to the validity of the patent and will be considered under its proper
heading.
In case an inventor wishes to assign his invention, he may do so at
any time, but the assignment must be duly recorded in books kept in


the Patent Office for that purpose. If he assigns his entire interest in
the invention before the issue of the patent, the assignee has the right
to prosecute the application as he sees fit, to the exclusion of the inventor,
and may employ an attorney of his own selection.
If the inventor retains an undivided interest in the invention, the
patent will upon request issue jointly to the inventor and assignee, or
assignees, provided the assignment is duly recorded. The Patent Office
will in this case, however, recognize the inventor in preference to the
assignee of a part interest.
EMPLOYER AND EMPLOYE.
In connection with the ownership of patents and inventions, two of
the most difficult questions to determine are those relating to the relative
rights of employer and employe and to the jointure of invention. These
questions usually arise in the case of suits for infringement, since it is
common for the defendant when sued for infringement to attack the
validity of the patent upon which he is being sued. If, therefore, it can
be shown that the alleged inventor is not the real inventor, or if it can
be shown in the case of joint inventorship that there was no real jointure
of invention, the patent will be declared invalid.
The question as to the relative rights of an employer and his employe
has come to be of considerable importance in modern times where cor-
porations and companies employ engineers, designers and draftsmen,
whose duties are to devise improvements or supervise the work being
done. In many instances the employees are under contract to assign
their inventions to their employer in consideration of the salary or other
emoluments which they receive. In case of an express contract, very
little, if any, difficulty arises, since a contract of this character is per-
fectly legitimate. (Hulse &amp; Wright vs. Bonsock Machine Co., C. D.
1895). The real difficulties arise where a contract must be implied, or
in the absence of any contract.
The mere fact that a person enters the employment of another for
the purpose of using his experience and skill in the development of im-
provements in machinery or processes for the benefit of his employer
does not of itself imply a contract to assign such improvements to his
employer. If such an agreement can be shown or circumstances from
which it can be implied, the employe is, of course, obliged to assign, but
the mere relation of employer and employe is not sufficient to imply it.
The relationship of employer and employe cannot, however, be established
where there is no consideration, as where the employe received no pay
for his services (Wherry vs. Heck, C. D. 1889). Where the employe
is employed to devise and perfect a machine, but the general plan and
specific details are conceived and reduced to practice by the employe, the


latter and not his employer is the inventor. (Greenlee &amp; Strom vs.
Roberts, C. D. 1891).
Where a skilled workman is employed to embody an idea in a prac-
tical form, the results are the property of the employer, unless it can be
shown that the workman discarded the original idea and proceeded upon
a distinct and separate plan of his own. (Hesey vs. Peters, C. D. 1892).
In one of the earliest cases on this point decided by the Supreme
Court (Agawam Company vs. Jordan, 7 Wallace, U. S.), the court said:
"Persons employed, as much as employers, are entitled to
their own independent inventions, but where the employer has
conceived the plan of an invention and is engaged in experi-
ments to perfect it, no suggestions from an employee, not amount-
ing to a new method or arrangement, which, in itself is a com-
plete invention, is sufficient to deprive the employer of the ex-
clusive property in the perfected improvement. But where the
suggestions go to make up a complete and perfect machine, em-
bracing the substance of all that is embodied in the patent sub-
sequently issued to the party to whom the suggestions were
made, the patent is invalid, because the real invention or dis-
covery belonged to another."
In Dalzell vs. Dueber Watch-Case Mfg. Co., C. D. 1893, it was
stated that
"a manufacturing corporation which has employed a skilled
workman for a stated compensation to take charge of its works
and to devote his time and services to devising and making im-
provements in articles there manufactured is not entitled to a
conveyance of patents obtained for inventions by him in the ab-
sence of express agreement to that effect."
A similar decision was reached in Solomon vs. U. S., C. D. 1891,
wherein it was stated that
"an employe performing all the duties assigned to him in his
department of service may exercise his inventive faculties in any
direction'he chooses with the assurance that whatever invention
he may thus conceive and perfect is his individual property."
It was stated, however, that the rule is subject to the limitation that
"the employe after successfully accomplishing the work for
which he was employed cannot plead title thereto as against
his employer."
A similar decision was reached in Gill vs. United States, 160 U. S.,
426, by the application of the doctrine of estoppel arising from the con-
sent given by the patentee to the government to use the invention.
The most recent case on this point is Pressed Steel Car Co. vs. Han-
sen, 137 F. R., 403, decided in the Circuit Court of Appeals. In this
case the defendant Hansen was the Chief Engineer, under agreement to
devote his entire time, skill and ability to the improvement of machinery


manufactured by the Complainant Company. No express contract to
assign inventions was proved, and in such a case of specific performance
a contract must be shown clearly and unequivocally. The court in its
'decision said as follows:
"In the absence of an express contract or agreement there-
for, the relation of employer and employe under whatever cir-
cumstances, at least short of specific employment to make an
invention, does not vest the employer with the entire property
right in an invention of the employe and to the patent monopoly
thereof or with anything more than the shop right or an irre-
vocable license to use the invention."
This was a very close case, one of the judges dissenting on the
ground that a contract to assign had been proved.
In Hulse &amp; Wright vs. Bonsock Machine Co. (supra) a contract
between an employer and employe, wherein the employe obtained service
on condition that any improvement he might make on the machines of
the employer should be to the exclusive use of the employer, was held
valid.
Joint Inventions.
As before stated, patents are frequently attacked on the ground that
there was not a proper jointure of the inventive act, and the question
arises as to what constitutes such a jointure in the sense of the patent law
In Schlich &amp; Field Co. vs. Chicago Sewing Machine Co., C. D. 1889,
it was stated as follows:
"Where two parties work together in the making of an inven-
tion, each making suggestions to the other, the invention covered
by a joint patent will generally be considered as the result of
their joint efforts or contributions."
And in Consolidated Bunging Apparatus Co. vs. Woerle, C. D. 1887,
it was stated that
"If one conceives the entire invention and another makes a
suggestion of practical value which the first one failed to think
of but which is needed to make the conception a success, this
will be sufficient to constitute them joint inventors."
In the case of a patent to joint inventors, the presumption is strongly
in favor of a proper jointure of invention (Hotchkiss vs. Greenwood,
4 McLean, 456), and in the Consolidated Bunging Apparatus Co. vs.
Woerle (supra) the matter was stated as follows:
"The mere fact that two or more persons unite in an appli-
cation for a patent as the product of their joint inventive efforts
creates a very strong presumption that the device sought to be
patented is the result of their united ingenuity, and to over-
throw this presumption the evidence should be clear and unequiv-
ocal."


Rights Acquired.
The rights which a patentee acquires under a patent grant are three:
1. He may assign it.
2. He may grant licenses under it.
3. lie may retain it himself.
In the latter case he may operate under it, if he so desires, or he
may do nothing with it while at the same time restraining others from
using it.
An assignment has been defined as:
"An instrument in writing conveying either (i) the whole
patent comprising the exclusive right to make, use, and vend the
invention throughout the United States, or (2) an undivided
part or share of that exclusive right, or (3) the exclusive right
under the patent within and throughout a specific part of the
United States." (Waterman vs. Mackenzie, C. D. 1891.)
The assignee is solely vested with the right in the first and third
cases and jointly with the assignor in the second case to sue infringers.
Any other transfer than those mentioned above is a mere license,
giving the licensee no title in the patent and no right to sue in his own
name for infringement.
An assignee of an undivided part of an invention within and through-
out a specified part of the United States is not properly an assignee
as above defined.
License.
As above stated, any conveyance of a right under a patent which
amounts to anything less than an assignment is a license. As stated
by Walker on Patents:
"The following have been held to constitute license only:
an exclusive right to make and sell but not to use; an exclusive
right to make and use but not to sell; an exclusive right to use
and sell but not to make; an exclusive right to make, to use
and to sell to be used for certain purposes but for no other."
In Adams vs. Burke, 17 Wallace, it was stated that
"The right to manufacture, the right to sell and the right
to use, are each substantive rights and may be granted or con-
ferred separately by the patentee."
In Heaton-Peninsular Button Fastener Co. vs. Eureka Specialty Co.,
C. D. 1897, it was stated:
"That the sole matter conveyed by a license is the right not
to be sued."
Licenses may be express or implied and they may be cither oral
or written. The latter have of course the advantage that they may be
proved with more ease and certainty. A license, moreover, need not be


recorded and tlie record of a license does not effect the rights of any
person. Where two licenses are issued in conflict, the first must prevail,
even where the second licensee had no notice of the existence of the
first. The granting of a license does not carry with it a warranty of
validity of the patent under which the license is issued and the licensee
cannot escape the payment of royalties by attempting to prove the patent
invalid.
A license is not assignable unless it contains a provision to that
effect, and when so assigned it is only as an entirety unless there is
express authorization to the contrary.
A license may be implied from the conduct of the parties, as in the
case of contracts. One of the commonest cases of implied license is, as
explained, under the head of Employer and Employe, where the employe
in the course of his duties devises an improvement which is duly patented.
In this case, while the employe is not obliged to assign the patent, a license
to the employer is implied, especially where the former acquiesces for
a time in the use by the employer. (Solomon Vs. U. S. and Gill vs.
U'. S. supra.) A license may also be implied where the patentee
acquiesces in the case of anyone who makes, uses, or sells, his invention,
or where the patentee accepts partial or full compensation for the acts.
Where, however, there is knowledge of the infringement and an omission
to interfere with the infringing acts and the omission can be fairly
accounted for on other grounds, no license will be implied.
Licenses may also be granted which are non-exclusive in character,
and, in fact, this form of license is in very common use today. When
a party obtains a non-exclusive license he is authorized to operate under
the patent within the terms of the license, but the patentee or owner of
the patent may also license others as he desires.
A specific form of non-exclusive license known as a "Shop Right"
is also sometimes issued, authorizing the licensee to make and use the
invention at a certain place or places named.
The third right which a patentee acquires is the right to work the
invention himself. Of course there is very little to be said under this
head. The right to work the invention carries with it the right to let
it lie idle and prevent others from working it. If he so desires, he may
keep it for the full term of seventeen years without actually reducing
it to practice, but in the meantime he may bring suit for infringement
at any time before the patent expires.
Infringement of Rights.
Having acquired certain rights under a patent grant, it is now
important to consider the infringement of those rights. The infringe-
ment of the rights under a patent simply consists in making, using, or


selling, the thing patented without the consent of the owner. In suits
for infringement the facts to be determined are:
1. Is the patent infringed?
2. Is the patent valid?
The question as to what constitutes infringement will now be taken
■up in its more important aspects, while the question of validity will be
considered under the head of Defenses.
For the purpose under consideration, patents may be divided into
Process Patents and Mechanical Patents. It should be noted that in
both classes of patents, to constitute infringement, it is the invention as
set forth in the claims which must be infringed, since it is not infringe-
ment to make, use, or sell a thing or use a process which is described
but not claimed. This point is clearly set forth as follows in the recent
case of O. H. Jewell Filter Co. vs. Jackson, 140 F. R., 340:
"The statute (Rev. St. Sec. 4888—U. S. Comp. St. 1901, p. 3383)
requires an inventor to particularly point out and to claim dis-
tinctly the improvement or combination which he desires to secure
as his discovery, and, when he has made his claims, he has
thereby disclaimed and dedicated to the public all other devices,
combinations, and improvements apparent from his specification,
and claims that are not mere evasions of those claimed as his
own, and he is estopped by his patent from thereafter claiming
a monopoly as to such devices, combinations, or improvements."
Moreover, the patent is infringed if one of its claims is infringed. A
process patent is infringed where substantially the process set forth in
any of its claims is used. It is not essential that the infringer's process
be identical with that of the patentee. It is essential, however, to the
infringement of a process claim that all of the series of acts constituting
the elements of the claim be present in the infringer's process unless an
•equivalent act or step be substituted.
The question of infringement in the case of machines and articles
of manufacture depends upon substantially the same principles as in the
case of a process and is always one of fact. Certain rules of law may,
of course, be applied to the case, but in its last analysis it is more or
less a matter of the opinion of the judicial tribunal before which the
question is tried. A few of the rules by which the court is governed in
its decision will be briefly set forth, but no attempt will be made to
enter into them in details, since they might be made the subject of an
exhaustive treatise.
A patentee is entitled to all of the uses to which his invention may
be adapted, whether or not such uses be mentioned or even known by
the inventor. It follows from this that even though the result arrived
at by the inventor and the infringer be identical, there is not infringe-


ment if the things which produced the result are different. That is, any
person is entitled to use the result which is produced in a patent pro-
vided he uses different means in its production. If the mode of operation
is substantially different ,then there is no infringement. On the other
hand, it is not always sufficient that the mode of operation be substan-
tially the same to constitute infringement, and a very slight difference
in this respect will be of sufficient importance to negative the charge of
infringement. This question is further complicated by the consideration
of what advance the patentee made over the prior art. If the advance
was great and the patent may be considered a "pioneer patent," a broader
construction will be given than where the advance was slight.
Where a patent claims a certain definite combination of elements
it cannot be avoided by adding an element, even though the addition
facilitates the working of the other elements of the claim. As stated bv
Walker, however, there is a necessary qualification to this rule. If the
patented combination differs from the prior art only in a difference in
operation resulting from such omission, it would not constitute infringe-
ment to restore such parts to the combination.
The charge of infringement may, however, be avoided by the omis-
sion of one of the elements of a combination. The claim is an entirety
and every clement is conclusively presumed to be material to the com-
bination. Evidence to the contrary is inadmissible. This rule is perhaps
the best known and most frequently applied of any of the laws relating
to the subject.
Infringement cannot be avoided by changing the relative positions
of the parts of a combination, if each element performs the same function
in the same way as in the patented combination. It is different, how-
ever, where the change of position results in a different mode of opera-
tion though the final result be the same. That is, a patentee may claim
a certain combination of elements co-operating in a definite way to-
produce a certain result. Such a claim is not infringed by a combination
of elements co-operating in a different way to produce the same result.
To substitute for an element of a claim an equivalent of that element
does not avoid infringement of the claim, whereas the substitution of an
element not an equivalent does avoid it. Nor is it essential that the
patentee has made a claim to equivalents or described them in a specifi-
cation, for it is always competent for him to invoke the doctrine of
equivalents. It may be different, however, where a patentee states in
his specification that a certain part is to be constructed of a specified
material, no mention being made of possible equivalents. Where the
material used by the alleged infringer was obviously an equivalent, the
infringement might not be difficult to establish, but where there was
some doubt on the subject the fact that the specification did not com—


prchend such a substitution would probably limit the patentee to the
particular material mentioned. This is likewise true of a change of form,
and an accurate statement of the law on this point is given in O. H.
Jewell Filter Co. vs. Jackson (supra), as follows:
"Mere changes of form of a device or of some of the mechan-
ical elements of a combination secured by a patent will not avoid
infringement, when the principle or mode of operation of the
invention is adopted, and the form of the machine or the ele-
ments changed is not the distinguishing characteristic of the
fnvention. But when the form of a mechanical element of a
patented combination is the essence of the invention claimed, a
change in it which prevents the combination in which it is
embodied from utilizing the principle or mode of operation
described in the patent to attain the result desired is not an
infringement."
As before stated, it is extremely difficult to define an "equivalent" in
such terms as to make it apply to all classes of cases. One thing is
certain, viz.. to be equivalents the things must perform the same function
and in substantially the same way. One thing may be an equivalent of
another and do more than the other, but it cannot do less. Furthermore,
to perform a function in substantially the same way docs not mean that
the ways shall be identical. Certain mechanical elements, like the screw
and the wedge, are well known to be interchangeable in a machine and,
although they are far from being identical in operation, they are, never-
theless, well known equivalents. The same is true of springs and weights.
It may happen, however, that in a certain combination, two elements
which are well known equivalents will not operate in the same way and
cannot be substituted for each other. In such a case the elements would
not be considered as equivalents. A wider range of equivalents is allowed
in the case of a primary or "pioneer" invention than in the case of sec-
ondary patents or improvements. In Millere vs. Eagle, C. D. 1894, it
was stated that
"The range of equivalents depends upon the extent and
nature of the invention. If the invention is broad or primary
in its character, -the range of equivalents will be correspondingly
broad under the liberal construction w-hich the courts give to
such inventions."
A "pioneer" invention is one that performs a function never before per-
formed, while a secondary invention is one that performs a function
which has been performed before but which performs it in a manner
different from that in which it had been hitherto performed. If the
patented invention is a mere improvement on an old machine, it is not
infringed by a still further improvement employing substantially different
means to perform the same function, whereas both improvements will


be subject to the pioneer invention. This distinction between primary
and secondary inventions is clearly brought out in the following leading
Supreme Court decsions: McCormick vs. Talcott, 20 Howard 405, 1857;
Railway Co. vs. Sayles, 97 U. S. 556, 1878: Morlcy Machine Co. vs. Lan-
caster, 129 U. S. 273, 1889.
Questions of infringement in the cases of compositions of matter
require a somewhat different treatment than in the case of machines,
although on the whole the underlying principles are the same. As in
the case of a mechanical combination the omission of an element avoids
infringement, so the omission of an ingredient from a composition avoids
infringement of a claim covering the same. On the other hand, the
addition of an ingredient will also avoid infringement, where a composi-
tion is thereby produced which is substantially dfferent. But where no
such different composition is produced and the ingredient is added simply
with a view to evading the patent infringement is not avoided.
ENFORCEMENT OF RIGHTS.
We now come to consider what means have been provided for en-
forcing the rights secured under a patent grant. The claims of the patent
having been allowed by the Patent Office, they are prima facie valid and
the patentee is entitled to bring suit thereon in any of the Circuit Courts
of the United States. Where the patent has been assigned, the suit is
brought in the name of the assignee. Otherwise, it must be brought in
the name of the inventor. It must, however, be brought in a circuit
in which infringing acts have been committed.
The plaintiff may sue, either in law or in equity. Actions at law
for the infringement of a patent are rare. The reason for this is that
the relief afforded by a court of law is not of the nature usually desired
by the plaintiff. All that a court of law can give is damages, while what
is almost always desired is an injunction and accounting, obtainable only
in a court of equity. It is not the purpose of this treatise to take up the
subject of court procedure nor to dwell upon the relative advantages of
the different forms of action, since these matters arc of interest to the
practitioner only and will be of slight importance to the engineer or in-
ventor. Suffice it to say, therefore, that patent suits arc usually brought
in the equity branch of the Circuit Court of the United States and the
remedies usually sought are an injunction and accounting.
Injunctions.
Injunctions may be either preliminary or permanent. The latter are
almost universally asked for in the bill of complaint and are granted as
a matter of course in the final decree if infringement is found by the
court. A preliminary injunction is not quite so common and it is neces-


sary to show good cause why it should be granted. "A preliminary in-
junction is usually granted after the filing of the bill but before the
testimony has been taken, although in some cases it is granted just before
the final hearing. Although, as before stated, the grant of a patent raises-
a presumption of validity, this presumption is not sufficient upon which
to base a preliminary injunction. Patents are oftentimes inadvertently
granted, and it would not be just to enjoin a party from making, using
or selling a device simply because of such a grant' and before the validity
of the patent has been judicially determined. In order that a preliminary
injunction shall issue, a special presumption of validity must be shown.
Such a presumption will be raised by showing that the patent has pre-
viously been adjudicated in a Federal Court and there held to be valid.
Another.way in which the presumption may be realised is by showing
that the public has acquiesced in the validity of the patent, as where the
article has been sold by the complainant for a long period of time and
no one else has undertaken to enter the field, or where others have long
been licensed under the patent and no one had heretofore attempted to
make, use or sell the article without such a license. A preliminary in-
junction may also issue where the defendant docs not deny the validity
of the patent.
It must also be clearly shown that there has been or that there is
danger of infringement, in order to enjoin the defendant. This may be
shown by proving that the defendant has offered the infringing articles
for sale or that he has them in his possession.
Upon such a showing, the court will issue a preliminary injunction
restraining the defendant from committing acts of infringement, pend-
ing a decision on the merits of the case. The injunction will then
either be dissolved or made permanent. In some cases, where there
appears to be danger of irreparable injury from delay, a temporary
restraining order may be issued by the court before the hearing of the
motion for a preliminary injunction.
A permanent injunction is usually issued after a decision in favor
of the complainant, unless the patent has in the meantime expired. An
appeal may always be taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals from a
decision of the Circuit Court in cases of injunction and a permanent in-
junction may be suspended pending such an appeal.
When the court has found for the complainant in a suit for infringe-
ment, the matter is referred to a Master for an accounting for profits.
The profits are those which the defendant made from the infringement:
i. c, the actual profits, not those which might have been made under a
more efficient management. Each infringement is considered by itself
and the profits thereof are credited to the complainant, while the losses
must be stood by the infringer; i. e., the losses will not be held as an


offset to the profits. The profits are sometimes held to be the difference
between the cost of making and selling the infringing article and the
amount received for them. The Master's report is submitted to the
court and is made the basis for a final decree.
Defenses.
Aside from the purely technical defenses which may be set up and
which are both numerous and complicated, the real defenses are two;
viz.,
1. That which denies infringement.
2. That which denies the validity of the patent.
Both defenses are usually set up.
As to the question of infringement, this has already been discussed
at such a length as is thought profitable for the present purpose. The
question of infringement is, as before stated, one to be decided by the
court on the law and the evidence.
The question of construction and interpretation of claims is also
somewhat foreign to the purpose of this treatise, since it is a subject in
which the engineer or inventor can hardly hope to be thoroughly versed.
It is, moreover, almost impossible to lay down a set of rules which will
apply to all cases. It may be said, however, that the claims are given
as broad a construction as is possible in view of the prior art and that
they are interpreted in the light of the specification. The court having
decided upon the scope and meaning of the claims, it remains only to
decide whether the alleged infringing article contains the combination of
elements called for by the claim when the latter is given the meaning
decided upon.
As before stated, the claims, having been allowed by the Patent
Office, are prima facie valid. There being a presumption of validity, it
is for^the defendant to show the contrary by a preponderance of the
evidence. This may be done and usually is done by setting up the
statutory bars already considered; viz., lack of invention, novelty or
utility. As stated elsewhere, however, there are certain other bars to
validity of a patent, which it would be pefectly competent for the Patent
Office to raise if they were known, but which from their nature cannot
usually be discovered without a thorough investigation. The most im-
portant of these is Public Use.
»
Public Use.
According to Sec. 4886 of the Revised Statutes, an invention which
has been
"in public use or on sale in this country for more than two
years prior to his application"


cannot be patented. If, therefore, such a use can be established, the
patent will be invalid.
The fact that two years' public use in this country before the filing
of a patent application is an absolute bar to the grant of a patent or to
the validity of a patent when granted renders it important that an inven-
tor should know just what "public use" is within the meaning of the
statute. One of the earliest decisions on this point is Elizabeth vs. Pave-
ment Co., 97 U. S., 137, 1877, wherein it was held that if an invention
is used by anybody, cither with or without compensation, it is public
use. In some cases, however, it is necessary for the inventor to so use
the invention that it will be profitable to him in order that he may de-
termine in what respect his invention is imperfect and how to improve it.
In such a case, if the inventor does in fact improve the invention in ac-
cordance with what the use has taught him, it is not public but experi-
mental use. (Sprague vs. Mfg. Co., 12 F. R., 724, 1882). If the ex-
perimental use continues longer than is actually necessary to try out the
invention, either as to length of time or number of tests, it then becomes
public use. (International Tooth Crown Co. vs. Gaylord, 140 U. S., 63,
1891). Moreover, one specimen of the invention, if used publicly, or
the knowledge of one person is sufficient to constitute a public use. It
was also held in International Tooth Crown Co. vs. Gaylord (supra)
that so long as the article is used in the way in which such articles are
commonly used it is not necessary that it should have been seen by the
public.
In Thompson-Houston Electric Co vs. Loraine Steel Co., 11 F. R.,
654, it was held that although a machine is in use experimentally, a
minor invention in the machine may be in public use. If a use is
carried on in good faith for the purpose of experimenting with the in-
vention, it is not public use even if continued for many years, and the
result of the test shows no need of improvement. In such a case there
is no necessity for secrecy, nor is it fatal that the inventor incidentally
profited thereby. It has even been held (Sinclair vs. Backus, 5 B. &amp; A.,
81, 1880) that even after the inventor is himself satisfied as to the opera-
tiveness and utility of his invention it is not public use to permit its use
with a view to satisfying others as to ts merits. Where, however, the
prime object of the use is profit and the testing is merely incidental, the
use becomes a public use. It is not essential that the use be known to
the inventor in order to constitute public use, and in attempting to in-
validate a patent it is common to show uses of the invention of which
the inventor could not possibly have been aware.
Aside from the question of "Public Use," the statute also requires
that an invention shall not have been
"known or used by others in this country before his invention
or discovery thereof."


This means that prior knowledge and use of an invention even by a
single person, although such knowledge or use may have intentionally
been kept secret, will operate as a bar to the validity of a patent granted
thereon. An apparent exception exists where, although a use il con-
clusively proven, such use has been long since discontinued and the
subject of the invention lost or abandoned. A case of this kind was
considered in Gaylor vs. Wilder, 10 Howard, 477. This case the court
considered analogous to that of a "lost art" which had been reinvented.
The jury was instructed to find for the plaintiff if two facts were clearly
shown:
1. That the subject of the invention had been finally forgotten and
abandoned before the later invention was made.
2. That the alleged inventor was in fact the real inventor.
This decision was clearly based upon the supposition that it was not
the intention of Congress to insist that a patentee be literally the original
and first inventor of the thing patented, but to reward him who first gives
the invention to the public. This doctrine has since been doubted but not
overruled.
Abandonment.
Another bar which the statute raises to the validity is that of aban-
donment. This bar may properly be considered under three heads:
1. The abandonment of an effort to make an invention.
2. The abandonment of the invention to the public after it is
completed.
3. The abandonment of the patent application.
When an inventor after an unsuccessful effort to complete an in-
vention, abandons the attempt, the invention becomes abandoned within
the meaning of the statute. Such attempts are known as "abandoned
experiments." If an invention has been so far completed as to operate
once to accomplish its function and was afterwards worked successfully
without change it is not abandoned if its use was discontinued because
the inventor turned his attention to something else. (Bromley Bros.
Carpet Factory vs. Stewart, C. D. 1892). If, however, only one device
was made and operated for a short time only and then laid aside and
not used again until other parties were making and advertising the de-
vice, a presumption of an abandoned experiment is raised. (Wurts vs.
Harrington, C. D. 1897). Such experiments confer no rights upon their
makers ,nor do they effect the rights of others.
An invention may be abandoned to the public in two ways:
1. Actual abandonment.
2. Constructive abandonment.


Both may occur cither before or after the tiling of a patent applica-
tion and once abandoned can never be revived. An invention may
be abandoned by making an express declaration to that effect. It may
also be abandoned by making a disclaimer thereto in a patent applica-
tion for another invention. If, during the prosecution of an application,
a claim for the invention is cancelled without substituting another claim
therefor before the patent issues, the invention covered by that claim
becomes abandoned. The invention may likewise be abandoned by the
filing of a formal disclaimer which does not form a part of the applica-
tion. Where an inventor describes an invention in an application without
claiming it, he is held to have abandoned it to the public.
Constructive abandonment follows from having the invention in
public use or on sale in this country for more than two years prior to
the date of his patent application. The question of "Public Use" and
"Sale"' has been discussed supra. No further discussion, therefore, along
this line seems expedient or necessary to this treatise.
There is another class of cases in which constructive abandonment
arises by virtue of a statute and is confined to cases filed after March
3, 1903. A case of this kind arises where an inventor fails to make appli-
cation until more than twelve months after an application is filed in a
foreign country, a patent having been granted upon such foreign appli-
cation.
An application may become abandoned without abandoning the in-
vention covered thereby. This takes place where the inventor fails to
file his complete application within the statutory period of one year after
he first makes his application, or where he fails to make such action
within one year after an action by the Office, as is required by the Office
practice. This matter is of small importance to the inventor or engineer,
inasmuch as such matters relate to soliciting merely and are usually
looked after by the Patent Solicitor.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
AUTO-TRANSFORMERS
Rew E. Woomjsy.
DESIGNED TO BE USED AS SINGLE PHASE, AND TO TRANSFORM FROM TWO PHASE
TO THREE PHASE OR FROM THREE PHASE TO TWO.
The action of the common auto-transformer when applied to the
transformation of a single phase current is very well known. It amounts
to the same thing as connecting the primary and secondary coils in series
and the method of action is as follows: Let P and S be the E.M.F. in-
duced in the respective coils by the core flux, then (see Fig. i):

r,,.i
The plus or minus sign indicates whether the E.M.F.'s are in the same
or opposite directions. The same equations hold for the current.
If two auto-transformers with equal numbers of primary turns be
connected across a two phase transmission line and the center (IF) of
one be connected to the end (C) of the other we have the arrangement
shown in Fig. 3.
Now if three phase taps be taken out at a point (D) ocrresponding
to 86.6% of the whole.number of turns between (C) and (H) with the
other two at (X)and (F) respectively we will get a three phase current
and electromotive force, the voltage over all three phases being equal and
currents differing by an angle of 60 degrees. (If in phase with the E.M.F.)
This may readily be seen by referring to (Fig. 4) where (M), (A/),
and (.1/) are of equal value forming the three sides of the equilateral
triangle and (C) has only 86.6% of the number of turns of (A) plus (/?),
the angle PQR being 60 degrees.
The problem which confronted one was not the difficulty of design


29
but the difficulty of construction, owing to the small number of turns and
the large number of taps which had to be brought out.
The coils were wound as follows:
A wooden form was constructed the size of the required coils and so
made that one end slipped off, allowing the coil to be withdrawn from
the form. A layer of common tracing cloth was first wound on the form
and over this was wound two layers of cotton, the whole being well
varnished with Sterling Armature Varnish. A layer of wire was then
wound on this and given a coat of varnish to make its insulation better.
Flat strips of copper were used in place of wire for taps as they took
up less space than the same cross section of copper and were more easily
soldered in the coil. The iron was cut to size for the yokes and cores
and then varnished with a thin coat of the armature varnish to reduce
eddy currents. When it was stacked it was found that as the iron was

warmed up the varnish softened, cementing the whole core together.
This was advantageous as it helped to cut down the humming which is
present especially if for any reason the flux density is run above its
normal value.
This transformer was not designed to carry over 500 volts on its
secondary winding and should not be run over this, although an insulation
test was made subjecting the transformer to 1000 volts . It would be
well to note bere that the limit of voltage that can be obtained single
phase is limited by the voltage that the insulation in the transformer can
stand without breaking down as well as by the heating, for it can readily
be seen by referring to the drawings that if we connect say one turn for
the primary and apply a voltage of 220, the secondary having 220 turns
we would get 48,400 volts over certain of the taps which would imme-
diately puncture the insulation.
The castings were made in the University Foundry and the bolts
used to bind the yoke plates together were insulated, for otherwise a
large current would flow around this single turn and raise it to a high

temperature in a very short time. The taps were brought out to plugs
in a slate switch board . The two regulators were also connected in on
this board and may be used with these transformers or connected across
to the large board.
The Computations are as follows:
Capacity per transformer = 15 K.W.
Primary volts = 240.
Secondary volts = 170.
Amperes in primary = 62.0.
Amperes in secondary = 87.5.
Frequency =: 60.
AB (see Fig. 1) =28.
CB (see Fig. 1) to carry == 62.
Current density in AB = 740 CM. per amp.
Current density in BC = 800 CM. per amp.
To carry the current at the above densities make
AB 2 No. 10 B.S. in parallel.
BC 3 No. 8 B.S. in parallel.
Number of turns on AB (see fig.) = 100.
Number of turns on BC (see fig.) = 42.
Total number of turns = prim. + sec. = 142.
Note.—Several different values of AB were tried with the result
that 100 was chosen as giving the best results.
From the relation 170 : 240 :: 100 : X, X = 142 turns.
Or 100 : 170 :: X : 70, X = 42 turns.
Flux density assumed at 6600 lines per sq. cm.
For area of cross section of iron in sq. in. we have
170X10'
A = —" = 15 sq. in.
444X60X6600X6.45X 100
Allow 10% for oxide, etc., we get
.90 X* = 15. X1 = 16.7 sq. in.
2 sq. in. must be allowed for corners (see Fig. 2).
16.7 + 2 = 18.7, total area of core.
X* = 18.7 sq. in. and X = 4.33 in.
On account of better insulation double cotton covered wire was used
throughout.
Wire dimensions are as follows:
Diam. of No. 8 B.S. = 0.146 in.
Diam. of No. 10 B.S. = 0.117 in.
Number of No. 8 D.C.C. wires per in. = 6.9.
Number of No. 10 D.C.C. wires per in. = 8.5.


Length of coil of wire assumed all wound in one layer.
Turns on AB = 50 X 2 -r- 8.5 = 11.7 in.
Turns on BC = 21 X 3 -H 6.9 = 9.2 in.
Total length = 20.9 in.
Wound to a depth of four layers.
Therefore the length is 20.9 -J- 4 = 5-25 in.
Add 0.23 in. for tape, etc.
Total length = 5.5 in.
Cross section of coil and wire = 4 33+°-'45X4+0-1'7X4=575 &gt;n-
Mean diameter obtained by taking half the depth of the wire plus
the diameter of the core =4.33+0.524=4.854 in.
Mean length of one turn of wire =4.68X4—8+M'+4+o.37=i745 in-
Mean length taken as 17.5 in.

PR loss in AB=28Xo.073=58 watts.
PR loss in BC=62Xo.oi28=49 watts.
Total I*R loss = 107.0 watts.
Volume of iron in the yokes = 6,775 cu- cm-

WHAT IS AN ENGINEER-CONSTRUCTOR?*
George A. Damon, '95.
One prominent element of modern industrial life is bigness. We have
large business corporations, combined railway systems, extensive manu-
facturing concerns and comprehensive enterprises in all lines of com-
mercial activity.
Another dominant element is efficiency, which may be taken as the
key word of modern business life and engineering practice. The constant
aim is not cheapness in construction or equipment, but effectiveness, the
greatest return for the outlay.
These two elements chiefly have brought about a condition in which
we have the necessity for a technical organization ready to produce large
results in an effective way. Between the desire for bigness and efficiency
and its fulfillment, is the field of operation for the creative and constructive
abilities of the Engineer-Constructor.
An Engineer-Constructor is an organization, and not an individual.
It makes possible the most effective combination of technical theory with
practical experience, and provides for the use of "team work" in con-
nection with the designing and building of properties. Its aim is to attain
the greatest economy in effort, time and money,—its province is to "do"
things in the most effective way.
In its broadest development such an organization need not be con-
fined to any one class of enterprise. Here is something to be built which
requires for its completion a combination of conception, technical
knowledge, construction experience and executive ability. Whatever
it is, the Engineer-Constructor should be prepared to carry the
proposition through from beginning to end without technical assist-
ance from outside the organization. To be most effective, such
an organization should have at its command the technical knowl-
edge and experience of the past; the ability to analyze situa-
tions, and discover the truth from conflicting testimony; the imagin-
ation to conceive unprecedented results and courage to overcome obstacles;
the ambition to improve existing systems, and the honesty to spend money
without favor or graft; and finally loyalty to itself and to its client,
which will protect in every way the interests of all concerned.
♦This paper was presented at a meeting of the Electrical Section of
the Western Society of Engineers, held Nov. 16, 1906.


An Engineer-Constructor, therefore, is nothing less than an ideal
employee who has the best possible preparation, the widest experience
and the natural aptitude to do in a large way the big things which the
development of this country is constantly requiring. Such an organization
substitutes for the isolated efforts of one or more individuals an effective
combination of the aggregate abilities of a number of experts and adds
the enthusiasm and inspiration which comes from the contact of fellow
workers.
The vocabulary of a member of such an organization would contain
such words as "Purpose," Perseverance," "Quickness," "Accuracy," "Men-
tal bravery," "Discretion," "Obedience," "Aggressiveness," "Confidence,"
"Self-control," "Judgment," "Tenacity," "Versatility," "Discipline,"
"Loyalty," and "Enthusiasm."
A statement of the principles along which he would develop would
contain the phrases, "Fundamentals of the profession," Every man should
master details," "Get into the work," "Start together and work together,"
"Whole heart in every move," "Perfection of team work," "Unified pur-
pose," "Combined efforts," "Theory counts only when put into practice,"
"Work hard," and "Hurry up."
For this organization we need a,—
Civil Engineer,
Electrical Engineer,
Mechanical Engineer,
Structural Engineer,
Sanitary Engineer,
Chemical Engineer,
Gas Engineer,
Fire Protection Engineer,
Hydraulic Engineer,
Mining Engineer,
Architect,
Industrial Expert,
Statistician,
Purchasing Agent,
Construction Superintendent,
Operating Engineer, -
Accountant.
An Engineer-Constructor is an organization in which a number of
these candidates are fitted together as a mechanic would build a machine,
and the efficiency of such an organization for the purpose for which it
is created depends upon, first,—the perfection of its individual parts;


second,—upon the skill with which these parts have been brought together;
and, third,—upon the absence of any unnecessary friction during operation.
Such an organization should not be the maker or manufacturer of
any equpiment, nor be connected with the exploitation of any system of
apparatus, nor interested in the introduction of any patented devices. In
its highest stage of deveopment it will not be connected except in a tech-
nical way with the financial interests which control the enterprise.
The carrying out of every big enterprise will entail nearly all of the
following duties:
Investigations and Reconnaisance,
Preparation of Preliminary Reports,
Estimates of Costs,
Estimates of Probable Earnings and Operating Expenses,
Surveys,
Preparation of Plans and Specifications.
Getting Proposals and Purchasing.

It is important to gain as mucTi ground as possible on every move.
In doing an entire job from start to finish, different men will appear in
nearly every move, but the precision of the team work hould be so per-
fected that every man will be in every move. To assist is fully as
important as to actually make the move. Look over the various situations
which this Engineer-Constructor organization which we are developing
is sure to face,—is there any detail which the candidate for responsibility
can afford to ignore? Is it not better to have an organization of trained
men prepared to help each other do these various things, rather than
depend upon unsupported individual effort?
Granted that such an organization of technically trained men can be
brought together, what arc some of the things which they may be called
upon to do? A few of the things requiring such ability and experience
in design and construction which first occur to us arc as follows:
Complete Steam Railroads,
Complete Electric Railways,


Electrification of Steam Roads,
Hydro-Electric Plants,
Transmission Systems,
Power Plants,
Gas Works,
Electric Lighting Systems,
Industrial Establishments,
Buildings for all Purposes,
Public Service Works.
In so far as an organization is prepared to effectively carry out any
of these enterprises just that far will it reach its highest development.
To show the possibilities of such an organization, let us pick out
a team for the building of some large proposition. Let us take, for
instance, the design and construction of a steam railroad locomotive repair
shop, involving the expenditure of from two to three million dollars.
In deciding on our men, we will make a study of the qualifications,
of each one, and at the same time we must have a clear conception of
the work each one must be familiar with in order that there be no break
in the organization. The selection of men with their chief duties will
be as follows:
Designing Layout of Shops.
Planning Method of Handling Work.
Arrangement of Tool and Transportation Equipment.
Providing Power and Lighting Equipment.
Laying Out Transmission Systems.
Planning Telephone and Signal Systems.

LINE UP OF THE ENGINEER CONSTRUCTOR TEAM
FOR THE BUILDING OF A RAILROAD REPAIR SHOP
Fig. i.
Let us watch the progress of the work. First will come a number
of preliminary studies, showing the proposed sizes, designs and relative
arrangements of the buildings. There will next be forthcoming a care-
fully perpared report, showing the advantage of the finally selected
arrangement, and the suggested construction of each of the buildings,
together with a description of the equipment required. An important
part of this preliminary report is an approximate estimate of cost, based
upon a careful consideration of all the items involved in the construction.
With the general layout and the preliminary report and estimate
approved, the next move is to prepare the plans and specifications. To
indicate the scope of this work, the following classification is shown, the
numbers being the key which is placed in each drawing, specification,


data sheet, report, or letter which may be originated as the work progresses.
The entire range of work undertaken by the company, and all inci-
dental construction connected therewith, is grouped under the following
general heads and assigned the range of numbers indicated:
Divisions of Classification.
General Subject.
Organization and Engineering.
Buildings and Building Material.
Hydraulic Construction and Equipment.
Bridges and Tunnels.
Tracks and Roadway.
Electric Transmission Lines.
General Equipment.
Power Plant Equipment.
Tools and Instruments.
Transportation Equipment.
Each division above is subdivided so as to cover all possible classes
of construction that may arise. Thus, for instance, in the. ioo to 300
scries it is possible to have one hundred subdivisions each representing
a different class of work. Each of these may, of course, again be divided
to any extent desired by using decimals. Each piece of work undertaken is
given a contract number which is prefixed to the general classification num-
ber and thus the identification of any letters, drawings, or data sheets is
made easy and certain. As an illustration, suppose the number 109 is as-
signed to roofing. This number would be used in roofing specifications and
contracts in all work done. Its particular application to roofing done under
contract 74 would be indicated by the number 74109. As a further sub-
division 109.1 might stand for slate roofing and 109.2 for composition
roofing. The number 74109.1 on a drawing would then indicate its rela-
tion to slate roofing for contract 74. To locate the building upon which
the roofing is placed a letter is placed after the number—a letter in all
cases locating the work, while the number indicates its character.
As an illustration of the above, we may note the following, taken
from a classification in use at the present time:
Parts of the Work.
A—Yard.
B—Power House.
C—Store House.
D—Oil House.
E—Office Building.
F—Locomotive Shop.


G—Forge Shop.
H—Iron Foundry. /
I—Pattern Shop.
J—Frog Shop.
K—Car Machine Shop.
L—Truck Shop.
M—Coach and Paint Shop.
N—Freight Car Shop.
O—Planing Mill.
P—Dry Lumber Shed.
Q—Dry Kiln.
R—Scrap Platforms, Sheds, etc.
S—Turntables.
T—Yard Crane.
U—Pipe Tunnel.
Detail Classification.
The detail is given for only one division, which is sufficient for illus-
tration.
74100—Buildinc Structures.
74101—Preparation of Site.
74102—Excavation and Fill.
74103—Piling.
74104—Foundations.
74105—Superstructure Masonry.
74106—Structural Steel and Iron Work.
74107—Carpenter Work.
74108—Mill Work.
74109—Roofing.
74110—Sheet Metal Work.
74111—Plastering.
74112—Painting and Glazing.
The plans should preferably be drawn upon one size of paper and
even- drawing should be numbered to correspond to the classification.
A border and a standard title printed by a draughting room outfit gives
a finished appearance to each drawing.
Specifications can now be printed very quickly, and when at least
twenty copies are required, they can be produced in this way as cheaply
as by carbon copies, or the better method of blue-printing from a type-
written record.
In the office the same system of classification is used for data and
estimates and all bills of material. There is also pubished in bine print
form a literature bulletin which contains references to articles in all the


current technical papers, which may be of interest to the officers and
engineers of the company, these references being classified according
to the same system. A well equipped library containing bound
volumes of most of the technical journals, proceedings of the engineering
societies, government and special reports of all kinds, makes this system
effective in results and efficient in its operation.
In purchasing, the Engineer-Constructor should find some advantage
over an occasional buyer. He is in the market constantly, is favorably
known by the manufacturers of standard equipment, and buys apparatus
delivered f. o. b. cars, doing all erection work as far as possible with his
own experts, and calling on the factory for assistance only when neces-
sary.
There should be the greatest unity between the engineering, the pur-'
chasing and the construction department. The plan of organization to
scure the results is shown by the diagram, Fig. 2. It is always better to
have the construction superintendent in the office while preliminary de-
cisions are being made and bills of material are being prepared.
Throughout the entire progress of the work, systems are in use to
keep all concerned informed as to each move. The construction office
is advised by the home office as to the material ordered and as to the
probable delivery of this material. The home office is advised as to the
receipt of material on the job, as well as to the progress of the construc-
tion work, and any reports and advices as to the labor situation. To
accomplish the former, copies of contracts for apparatus and orders for
material are sent to the superintendent in charge of construction. Such
reports and orders contain exact information as to the material covered
by them, as well as to the time at which this material is expected to
arrive on the work. A card system in which are entered all orders and
contracts is used in the home office, and is designed to follow up and
secure prompt delivery of all material and apparatus. In case of any
changes in time of delivery of material, the construction superintendent
is advised in advance, and is thus in position to make any alterations
necessary in his program. The importance of promptly delivering the
material on the job cannot be over estimated, and the value of a system
that will provide for the delivery of the materials in accordance with an
approximate schedule previously arranged for will appeal to all interested
in construction work.
Practically all of the material is ordered by the home office. In case,
however, it is more advantageous to order small quantities at the seat
of the work, such orders are issued by the superintendent, a copy of all
such orders being sent to the home home office, after which they are re-
corded and handled in all respects similar to orders issued from the office.
Records of all material received on the job are kept by the superin-


FlC. 2.

tendent in .the form of a material report. These reports are written out
in a duplicate book as each shipment is received, and one copy is sent
without delay to the main office. This serves to keep the home office very
closely in touch with the field work, so far as the receipt of material is
concerned.
In construction work consisting of a great many items, such as will
be found in railroad shops, it is very desirable to know with a fair
degree of accuracy the exact progress of the work. Certain lines of the
work, such as the delivery and installation of machinery, are depend-
ent upon the progress of other work, such as the completion
of the buildings and foundations. In order that this information
may be aways at hand, progress reports from the work are received at
stated intervals, usually two weeks apart, giving in detail the progress
of the work under each classification head. This information is kept in
form for convenient reference, and is useful in a variety of ways. Not
only do these rports keep the engineering force in touch with the pro-
gress if the work, making it possible to more efficiently insure the work
coming in proper sequence, but they also provide the information neces-
sary to make decisions as to changes in detail, in case such are found
necessary after the work has been begun. These progress reports, to-
gether with a record of moneys expended for material and labor at any
date, give timely information as to the actual cost of the work as com-
pared to the estimated cost. As such reports are made on the work under
each classification heading, any variation of the cost from the estimate
is at once detected. This is of importance to the constructor who pro-
poses to complete a certain improvement within a definite estimated
eost, and to the client's official who may be charged with the responsibility
of protecting a definite appropriation.
Wherever it is possible, curves or diagrams are used to represent
the condition of affairs of which record is to be kept. A chart showing
the progress of the work on building construction is easily made, and
shows very clearly at a glance the exact condition of the work at any
time. Such a chart is shown in Fig. 3, which indicates the progress of
the work on one of the buildings at the time of completion of the fifth
payroll. On this chart the base represents the total estimated cost, and is
divided into the various classifications covering the cost of this particular
building. In this case these classifications cover excavation and fill (about
2/3% of the total cost), concrete footings and piers (about 6 2/3% of the
total cost), while the other divisions, such as engine pits, underground
heating ducts, concrete superstructure, and so on make up the total cost
of the building. At the end of each two-weeks period, the total expense
that has been incurred during the two weeks previous is plotted under
each classification head, and this area on the chart indicated in such a


way as to designate the progress made during the particular, period in
question. A glance at the chart will show the total amount completed
under each classification represented on the chart at the time the last
entry was made, as well as the amount of work done under the various
classifications during each period considered.
Moreover, it is at once evident that, during the period of the fifth
payroll about ten per cent, of the work on the engine pits, twenty per
cent on the concrete superstructure, thirty-six per cen. of the brick work,
fifteen per cent, of the sills and coping, forty per cent, of the windows ■
and small doors was completed, and no work was done on the smoke-
jacks and ventilators, none on the roofing, and none on the sash operators
and foundations. In other words, these progress reports become the
graphical history of the job. After having made out the necessary re-
ports covering both the material and the labor that have been used on
the work, it is a very simple matter to embody these results in the
chart. A copy of this chart is then sent to the main office where it
remains until the time for the next report, at which time it is sent back
to the job for the additions that have occurred during the period.
In addition to these some other curves, showing the progress of the
work may be of interest. These contain in graphical form a record of
the number of workmen employed on the work at all times, together
with information as to the number of carloads of material received, the
weather conditions, and other matters of interest.
Progress photographs are taken of the work at intervals of about
two weeks. These show at a glance not only the general progress of the
work, but many construction details, as well, which are of interest and
value. These photographs are of a standard size, and mounted on cloth,
so as to be bound in convenient form for reference. All the reports
just referred to, viz., the progress reports, charts and diagrams, while
very easily obtained, and requiring but little work in their preparation,
supply a great deal of valuable information, and are of worth far ex-
ceeding the trouble and expense contracted in securing them.
Athough every facility is provided for keeping the main office and the
construction office in close touch, it should not be understood that the
engineering is done at arm's length, and that all plans and specifications
are devised and completed by an engineering force in the office to be
sent down to the construction superintendent on the job for his execution
A competent engineer is in charge of all construction work, and spends
a certain amount of time in the field, thus putting him in close touch
with the situation, and enabling him to more efficiently direct the de-
tailed engineering work that is done in the main office.
It would be a big mistake to think that such an organization as we
arc outlining could be got together and perfected in its work in a short


time. A winning team is not made in a week, a month ,or even a year.
It takes time to find the men, to break in raw material, to perfect the
plays, to develop a system, and to create a loyalty both inside and out-
side -the -team. In the case of our Engineer-Constructor parallel it will
probably take years, and it is evidently for this reason that this very in-
viting field is occupied by so few organizations which are really prepared
to do the work justice. Our football players have learned the benefits
of concentrated cooperative efforts when applied to their sport much
sooner and better than have technical teachers and graduates recognized
the same truths as applied to our life work, and yet the advancement
of technical progress is certainly more important than the perfection of
the game of football. The technical student of today is to be congratu-
lated uopn having before him such a splendid opportunity in a field
which has not been worked harder than that occupied by the Engineer-
Constructor.
It will be instructive to study the development of at least one com-
pany which is now prepared to play at this new game of Engineer-Con-
structor.
Ten years ago the president of this company was a consulting electri-
cal engineer,—an expert on electrical questions, and in a consulting
capacity only. Then came the natural addition of mechaniacl problems,
still in a consulting capacity. The introduction of the system of rotary
converters for electric railway work, and of an improved system1 of
power plant construction, made it necessary to take two contracts in
which the results of these two systems, which were advised by the con-
sulting engineer, were guaranteed. Thus a contracting company was
formed and a construction department organized. This move developed
the fact that the same brains which made the plans for an installation
could be mixed with some enterprise and business ability, and thus actually
bring about a complete result.
This worked so well that other contracts for complete electric sys-
etms were sought and secured,—sometimes as engineers, sometimes as
constructors, occasoinally as both. Civil, structural, architectural, indus-
trial, and hydro-electric departments were added as the business grew.
Systems of carrying on the work were perfected as experience dictated
and weak parts were made stronger. Today this company has on its
payrolls a technical force of over eighty men, and often employs on its
construction enterprises thousands of skilled mechanics, experienced fore-
men, and unskilled laborers.
Most of the work of this company is done on the basis of "cost plus
a percentage," that is, the work is done at actual cost, and then the
Engineer-Constructor gets a percentage fee for his services. By such
an arrangement the client of purchaser is relieved of the necessity of


organizing a technical force of his own, or of empolying a number of
individual specialists. If the actual construction work is turned over to
the Engineer-Constructor, then the client is relieved of the inconvenience
of obtaining proposals and awarding contracts to a large number of sep-
arate contractors, with the attendant delays, conflicts and "extras," which
even the closest supervision will hardly avoid.
The difference between the "cost plus a percentage" and the "cost
plus a fixed sum" plans is not generally understood. If an Engineer-Con-
structor is thoroughly trained in drawing plans, has sufficient actual ex-
perience to make a reliable estimate, is absolutely honest in all things,
and has complete control of a competent construction organization, then
the "cost plus a percentage" arrangement is the better; but if the work
is planned by an engineer and architect, and the actual building work is
turned over to a separate construction organization, thus maintaining the
old relationship of engineer and contractor, then the "cost plus a fixed
sum" plan, no doubt, has advantages. The "percentage" plans express a
shade more of confidence between the client and the builder than the
"fixed sum" basis.
If the duties of making a preliminary report, preparing a careful
estimate, drawing up the plans and specifications, purchasing the materials,
building the structures, erecting the equipment ,and installing the machin-
ery is turned over to one reliable Engineer-Constructor organization on
a "cost plus a percentage" plan with the privilege to the client of can-
celling the arrangement at any time, if the progress, quality, or cost of
the work should prove to be unsatisfactory, it is hard to conceive of a
more effective way of getting results, and it is very probable that much
of the important work of the future will be done upon this basis.
Such a business as has been outlined can only be built up by the
demonstration of unquestioned abitty, and the possession of not only
absolute honesty, but also of those qualities which insure what has be-
come known as the "square deal."

DOBLE TANGENTIAL WATER WHEEL IN THE
HYDRAULIC LABORATORY
C. W. Whitney, '99.
Through the efforts of Dean M. E. Cooley, the University of Mich-
igan has secured for installation in the hydraulic laboratory of the new
Engineering Building, the Doble tangential water wheel which was ex-
hibited at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis in 19x14. This
water wheel is of particular interest by reason of its having been awarded
the Grand Prize, the highest award by the Exposition and the only
Grand Prize awarded for machinery manufactured west of St. Louis.
The wheel is also of special value for laboratory use, since it was con-
structed for commercial operation according to the high standards of its
manufacturers. Wheels embodying the same features of design have been
built for heads up to 2,200 feet and in capacities up to 9,000 horsepower,
these being single wheels taking water from single jets.
The water wheel was exhibited at St. Louis direct-connected to an
electric generator, the unit forming one of the seven generating units
which constituted the power plant of the Intramural Railway. This plant
was installed in Machinery Hall as an operating exhibit the combined
capacity of the seven units being 3,500 kilowatts. Six of the generators
were directly driven by reciprocating steam engines, each of a different
make, and embodying four distinct types. The seventh generating unit
was the water wheel unit shown in Fig. 1. Because of the unique com-
bination of machinery used and the satisfactory results obtained from its
operation, it attracted considerable attention throughout the entire Expo-
sition period.
The unit consisted of a 100-kilowatt railway-type Crocker-Wheeler
generator, driven at a speed of 700 R. P. M. by a 170-horse-power Doble
tangential water wheel operating under a pressure equal to a head of
700 feet. This working exhibit was displayed by the Abner Doble Com-
pany, Engineers of San Francisco, and the details of its installation were
carried out in a thoroughly scientific manner. Fig. 2 illustrates the de-
sign of the unit. It is interesting to note that this was the first time that
a water wheel had been shown in actual operation and doing useful work
at a world's exposition.
The hydro-electro unit was an excellent illustration of the manner
in which electricity is generated in high-head water-power plants on the
Pacific Coast and elsewhere, and in fact was a typical water-power plant


in itself. Water, under the hydraulic pressure necessary, was furnished
by a duplex triple-expansion mining pump, because no natural high head
of water was available at St. Louis. The pump had a capacity of 1,200
gallons per minute and was installed by the Jeanesville Iron Works Com-
pany.
The water wheel was 31 inches in diameter and was driven by a i'A
inch jet of water. Constant speed of the unit was maintained by means
of a Lombard hydraulic governor. For measuring the quantity and pres-
sure of the water furnished to the wheel, instruments were installed, con-
sisting of a lo-inch Venturi meter with a register, chart recorder and
manometer, and a recording and indicating pressure gauge. From the
readings of these instruments the total input of energy could be obtained,
and the output, taken from the switchboard instruments, enabled the total
efficiency of the hydro-electric unit to be arrived at.
Following is given a detailed description of the water wheel and its
parts as installed at St. Louis, with mention of the alterations made to
adapt it for laboratory use at Michigan.
The hydro-electric unit was of the two-bearing type, the water wheel
being mounted on the extended end of the generator shaft. This two-
bearing type of construction originated with the Abner Doble Company,
and is now being generally adopted in modern water-power plants. A
heavy cast-iron sub-base carried the generator, water wheel, cast-iron
housing and needle nozzle, so that the entire machine formed a self-con-
tained compact piece of apparatus. At St. Louis the sub-base was securely
imbedded in a concrete foundation. The water-wheel end of the base
overhung the tailrace pit, the latter being extended so as to give room
for a by-pass pipe to enter and connect with a relief valve. This extended
part of the pit had a cast-iron cover with a plate-glass center, so that
the discharge of the wheel and the action of the relief valve could be ob-
served. The relief valve was provided so as to avoid excessive pressure
in case the water-wheel nozzle should be suddenly closed by the governor.
The design of the buckets, wheelbody and nozzle was based on a fac-
tor of safety of 10, and the material used for these parts was tested as
recommended by the International Association for Testing Materials.
Only sound and faultless castings were used.
In order that the action of the water on the buckets, as well as the
perfect form of the jet issuing from the needle nozzle, might be observed
at all times, the sides of the water-wheel housing were constructed of
heavy plate glass.
The buckets are gun-metal castings and are of the Doble patented
ellipsoidal type such as shown in Fig. 3. The superiority of the ellip-
soidal bucket lies in the fact that because of its form, the jet of water
enters without shock or disturbance, and is discharged along natural lines

over the entire bucket surface. The central portion of the front entering
edge or lip of the bucket is cut away in the form of a semi-circular notch.
This opening allows the solid jet to impinge on the dividing wedge of the
bucket without being split in a horizontal plane, and thus wastefully
diverting part of the water from the wheel. With the ellipsoidal bucket
all eddy currents are avoided, and, as the full force of the jet is spent in
doing useful work, the efficiency of the bucket is very high. The absence
of eddy currents results in even wear and remarkable durability.
Each bucket straddles the rim of the wheel body, and the fastening
lugs or flanges are milled to gauge on a specially designed machine, so
that the bucket will accurately fit the wheel on the periphery and on both
sides of the rim. The semicircular notch and the dividing wedge of the
bucket are milled in a jig so that all travel in the same plane. Each
bucket is fastened to the wheel rim by two body-bound steel stud bolts,
fitted in reamed holes. Each bucket is carefully ground smooth and pol-
ished on the hydraulic surfaces, and the dividing wedge and entrance
edges are accurately machined, and sharpened to a knife-edge. The buck-
ets are interchangeable, being accurately fitted and drilled in jigs, and
finally brought to the same weight so that the wheel is dynamically and
statically balanced. Fig. 4 illustrates the complete wheel runner.
The wheel body is a semisteel casting, finished all over and balanced.
The rim was finished to template, the latter being the mate of the template
to which the lugs of the buckets were milled. The hub was bored and
keyseated to fit the generator shaft.
The shaft of the generator extends beyond the bearing, the water-
wheel being secured thereon by a steel nut with brass washer.
The nozzle is of the Doble patented needle regulating type, and for
the exhibit at St Louis was operated by a hydraulic governor directly
connected to the needle stem . This type of nozzle permits close regula-
tion of speed and maintains a high efficiency of the jet over a wide range
of discharge. The regulating is done by moving an axial core—the needle
—in a longitudinal direction within the nozzle, thus changing the annular
area of the orifice and the quantity of water discharged. The nozzle pro-
duces a solid cylindrical jet of high efficiency. Investigation of this type
of nozzle made at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston
determined an efficiency as high as 99.3%. Fig. 5 illustrates a jet from
a Doble needle nozzle, showing its perfect cylindrical form.
The main nozzle casting is made of semisteel and after complete
machining it was subjected to a test of one and one-half times the work-
ing pressure for a period of five hours. The nozzle tip is detachable and
consists of a steel forging, machined all over, the inner or hydraulic sur-
face being finished to template and polished. The regulating needle is a
steel forging machined all over, the needle bulb and point being finished


to template and polished. The other end of the needle stem is provided
with a counter-balancing plunger made of gun-metal, working through a
cup-leather gland.
Instead of a stuffing box there is provided in the opening, where the
shaft passes through the back glass plate of the housing, a patented cen-
trifugal water guard, which prevents leakage, and at the same time pro-
vides ample ventilation, thus permitting an easy discharge of the water
into the tailrace. This water guard is of brass, machined and polished.
It consists of two elements as indicated in Fig. 6. The revolving-
disk is fastened to the shaft, and revolves with it, and the stationary
disk is bolted to the glass plate of the housing. The edges of the two-
elements overlap each other, forming an ample air space between them,
through which air is drawn from the inlet between the shaft and the
stationary disk. The form of this device is such that water running down
the side of the housing will flow around the stationary disk, while the
revolving element throws off any water that may fall on it, thus pre-
venting water from creeping along the shaft.
The baffle-plate, opposite the nozzle inside the housing, serves to pre-
vent water from being carried around by the wheel and also protects the-
housing in case the wheel should run over speed. It is a heavy iron cast-
ing and is securely bolted to the housing.
To adapt the water wheel for installation in the hydraulic laboratory
at Michigan required several alterations. Under its new conditions it is
to operate under an artificial head of water furnished by a i6x9x 12-
inch underwriter fire pump with a capacity of 750 to 800 gallons per
minute. A pressure of at least 200 pounds can be easily maintained with
this pump and possibly 250 pounds can be obtained. To operate efficiently
under these pressures required a change in the ratio of number of buck-
ets to pitch diameter and this was accomplished by constructing a new
wheel center of the same diameter and reducing the number of buckets
from 30 to 20.
The bearings and shaft of the unit installed at St. Louis were fur-
nished with the generator and new ones had to be made for the Michi-
gan wheel. The new shaft is 7 feet in length and 4 inches in diameter ia
the bearings. Between the bearings the shaft is 5 inches in diameter and
the length—2 ft. 10 inches—will be ample for the use of a Prony brake
or other testing apparatus. The water wheel runner is held on the shaft
by means of a brass nut, and at the opposite end of the shaft is extended
6 inches beyond the bearing to give room for the use of a tachometer or
revolution counter. The bearings are of the ring-oiling pedestal type,
and were designed specially for this unit. A new hand rig was made to
operate the needle valve and this can be readily scaled so as to indicate
the varying areas of nozzle opening.


Fig. 6.
Fie. 7.


Fig. 7 shows the water wheel as altered for installation at Michigan.
With a pressure of 200 pounds equivalent to a head of 470 feet and the
pump delivering its rated capacity this wheel will develop about 75 horse-
power. With added pump capacity, operating under a pressure of 250
pounds or 580 feet with the full I'/a inch jet, the wheel will deliver
125 horse-power. The speed of the wheel will be about 650 revolutions
per minute.
The water wheel is to be installed on the second or mezzanine floor
of the hydraulic laboratory. There it will receive water under the re-
quired head from a large pressure tank, the discharge being delivered into
a diverter which rotates on a vertical axis and serves to conduct all the
water into either of two weighing tanks or through a spout beneath, to
waste, as desired. The naval tank will be used as a reservoir* from which
the water used for the experiments will be pumped, and into which the
water will be discharged after use.
It will be possible to conduct tests upon the wheel under all pressures
within the capacity of the pump. This can easily be done with the needle
regulating nozzle which permits the area of the stream to be varied as
desired without destroying its parallelism or its round and smooth form.
The original wheel center used at St. Louis also forms part of the equip-
ment so that when the necessary pumping arrangements are made it will
be possible to conduct tests up to 700 feet or even higher heads. With
such a wide range of possibilities for testing this tangential water wheel,
which is of standard construction throughout, we have every reason to
expect that results will be obtained at the University of Michigan which
will not only be extremely interesting to the students but also valuable to
the manufacturers and users of tangential water wheels in general.


A CIVIL ENGINEER'S OPPORTUNITIES
Geo. Y. Wisner, '65.
It is said that every man in his life's work crosses the road to suc-
cess and fortune at least once in early life, but unfortunately most of ns
are looking for an easy road to travel, and generally turn in the wrong
direction.
As graduation day approaches, the student in engineering becomes
anxious for'a position with a good fat salary, in which he can put in prac-
tice his knowledge of engineering, which many think they have mastered
on leaving the University. What the position is likely to be, depends
winch upon the business conditions of the country at the time the engin-
eer is graduated. The business history of the world shows that waves
of prosperity and depression follow each other at intervals of seven to
fifteen years. The civil engineer who finds himself ready to start in busi-
ness when everything is booming, can generally step into a fairly lucra-
tive position at once, provided his university record shows that he has the
necessary energy and ability to do good work.
On the other hand the civil engineer who is graduated during a period
of financial depression may consider himself fortunate to secure a posi-
tion as chainman on some survey party. Within the last ten years the
writer has had charge of a large engineering force of which nearly every
chainman was a selected graduate in engineering. Several of these chain-
men are now holding responsible and lucrative engineering positions, and
in some instances have for assistants men under whom they served in a
subordinate capacity. From this it appears that bright business opportuni-
ties at the time of graduation may not always be the surest stepping stones
to professional success.
The engineer who starts in business during a period of financial de-
pression gets an experience which fits him for rapid advancement when-
ever the business of the country becomes sucli that the services of able,
self-reliant engineers arc in demand, provided he does not discover dur-
ing this period that engineering is not suited to his taste, and decides
to drop out of the profession.
The engineer who starts in at a time when he can make a choice of
positions has by no means a handicap over the one starting under less
auspicious conditions. Corporations never fail to diminish their force
when they find that business conditions will not warrant the expense, and
the engineer who has failed to make his services so valuable that his


employers can not afford to permanently lose him will find himself out
of a job, and if he has to accept a position which is inferior to that here-
tofore held, it is humiliating to say the least.
There is no other profession in which integrity plays so important
a part in the career of an individual as in civil engneering. In a majority
of cases where an engineer is called to report on the feasibility of a pro-
ject, the fact that it is feasible is not nearly so important as to have it
so stated over the signature of an engineer whose standing is such as to
guarantee its correctness. Many of these enterprises are for the purpose
of unloading stocks on the public, and the engineer who neglects to turn
such projects down hard, fails to grasp his opportunity, even if by so
doing he forfeits a good fee.-
The value of an engineer's services by no means depends upon the
amount of work he personally performs, but upon his executive and
professional ability to obtain the results desired at a minimum cost. There
is always a position awaiting the man who finishes his work sooner than
expected, but none for the one who prolongs his work because he has
nothing else in sight.
After an engineer has made a fair start in the practice of his pro-
fession the opportunities for advancement are largely the result of his own
energy, integrity and good judgment. In competition with other engin-
eers everybody should be given due credit for all they are worth, remem-
bering that it is far more creditable to be the associate of a master mind
than to distance some one whose ability has been belittled. An engineer
to get the best results, whether it be in making investigations or in con-
struction work, must be able to establish an "esprit de corps" such that
the entire engineering force works as a unit. When such works are
completed there is usually a position awaiting every man connected with
its execution.
We sometimes hear it stated that certain projects are engineering
failures. If we investigate the conditions and causes of such failures, in
nine cases out of ten it will be found that the engineers in charge have
not loyally supported each other, and in an effort to absorb the credit
of work to which they are not justly entitled, the entire force becomes
the victim of lack of good judgment on the part of a few. An engineer's
first duty is loyalty to his work and to his employers. An assistant en-
gineer's responsibility does not terminate with the duties of the position
he holds. He must be as fully equipped as possible to assume the func-
tions of his chief if needed, and in any event to make his services valuable
to his chief and to his employers.
Railroad and bridge engineering are practically fixed by the standard
practice of the main trunk lines of railroads, and the shop methods of the
large bridge companies. Experience in either is always a valuable asset


for an engineer, but beyond that, there is little inducement for the young
engineer to take them up as a life work.
Hydraulic engineering is the broadest field open to the civil engineer
at the present time. It is so closely allied with the development and
transmission of electrical power that a knowledge of electrical engineering
is an essential qualification of the successful hydraulic engineer. It is
believed that the electric motor will supersede the locomotive before many
years, and with such a change will come the utilization of every water
power in the country.
The construction of the Panama Canal will require the solution of
engineering problems on a scale never before undertaken, and will give
both opportunity and employment for many of the engineers who care for
experience in a tropical climate.
The dams, reservoirs, canals, tunnels and conduits to be constructed
for reclaiming the arid lands of the west have given rise to a demand for
first class hydraulic engineers and have demonstrated the necessity of
more thorough training along this branch of engineering. The pay roll
of the technical force of the Reclamation Service is now about $600,000
per year, and is not likely to decrease in the near future.
The Barge Canal from Lake Erie to New York will furnish employ-
ment for a large number of engineers for several years to come.
The construction of a twenty-foot waterway from Georgian Bay to
the St. Lawrence River at Montreal will probably be commenced by the
Canadian government in a few years, and incidentally result in the de-
velopment of nearly a million horse power on the Ottawa River, now
running to waste. The beds of the Hudson River, East River and De-
troit River are being pierced with tunnels to enable railroads to trans-
port their passengers and freight with greater safety and economy. In
our larger cities subways are being excavated beneath the streets and
buildings to relieve the congestion of traffic on the main thoroughfares,
and the rapid growth of many of these cities will make a greater and bet-
ter water supply for domestic purposes necessary in the near future.
These great undertakings, together with the minor enterprises all over
the country, furnish ample opportunity for the graduate who has the
proper elements for an engineer in his natural make-up, to demonstrate
what he can do. ,
With all this in view, the fact still remains that the number of en-
gineers who have become prominent in their profession are few. A
study of the lives of these successful men shows clearly that money con-
siderations have had but little to do with their line of action. The fact
that they receive large fees is due to a demand for the service they are
capable of rendering, in excess of the supply by engineers who have the
ability, experience and reputation which will meet the requirements.


It must not be imagined that a University diploma is a talisman that
will open the door to professional success. The development of the civil en-
gineer is a process of slow absorption, and in the case of some of us,
we become old enough to die before we are able to say "we know," in
regard to matters which in early life we say "we will look up." Unfort-
unately many of the things which we have to look up, we afterwards
learn should have been determined. There is no class of literature that
should be accepted with greater caution than that found in engineering
reference books, and the engineer should never neglect the opportunity
to determine data when possible to do so.
Of the students who enter a freshman class expecting to graduate
as engineers, not more than fifty per cent are likely to graduate with
records that will warrant them in taking up the practice of engineering
as their life work. Of this fifty per cent, at least one-half will find the
work uncongenial and will drift into other lines of business. It is by
no means encouraging after spending four years at hard study in college,
to have to accept a less compensation for services than actually received
before commencing the course, as sometimes happens, and wherever good
business situations are open to a graduate it is not strange if he accepts,
and drops his profession entirely. The course, however, is a good one for
a business man to take, and the graduate who drifts into such a life seldom
regrets having taken it.
It is probable that nearly every young man looks forward to the
time when he can have a home of his own, where he can entertain his
friends and enjoy the society of his family. The opportunities of an en-
gineer to realize such anticipations are as scarce and as disappointing as
the high salaried positions which he looks for when he is graduated. The
life of an engineer is more or less that of a "Bohemian." He knows no
place as home for any great length of time. If he gets married, he is
indeed fortunate if able to spend half of his time with his family, unless
his wife should happen to think enough of him to be willing to drop home
associations, and the comforts of civilization, to share with him the dis-
comforts of a camp with a Chinese cook.


THE DETROIT RIVER TUNNEL
Benjamin Douglas, "82.
The purpose of this paper is to give a brief general description of
plans considered and those adopted for the Detroit River Tunnel, together
with a brief description of construction methods that will probably be used.
The tunnel is intended primarily for trains of the Michigan Central
Railroad. If other railroads wish to use the tunnel it can easily handle
their traffic in addition to that of the Michigan Central.
There will be two single track tunnels with a clear head room of
18 feet above top of rail. The total length of the tunnel is 7,960 feet,
about 2,600 feet of which is under the river. The open cuts at the ends
are 4,840 feet long, making the total length of tunnels and approaches
12,800 feet, approximately two and one-half miles. There will be two
curves, one near each edge of the river. Their aggregate length, including
easements, will be about 2,600 feet with two degrees as the maximum
rate of curvature. The rest of the tunnel and approaches will be straight
The westerly end will have a two per cent grade extending from the
westerly summit, near where Baker street crosses the Michigan Central,
to a point under the river about 1,000 feet from the Detroit Dock Line.
From a point under the river near the Canada shore, the tracks will
rise on a one and one-half per cent grade to the easterly summit. For
about 1,000 feet under the river the grade will be level. For several
reasons it is desirable to have the westerly approach as short as prac-
ticable. The grade will therefore be steeper than it would otherwise
have been made. Except for the actual cost of construction, there is
little necessity for using a steep grade for the easterly approach, but
there would be little gained by making the grade so light that longer
trains could be handled East than West. Because of the large percentage
of empty cars moving West, it is thought that about the same number
of cars can be hauled up a 2 per cent grade going West as up a llA per
cent grade going East.
The open cuts at the ends of the tunnel will be simple in construction
with no very important novel features. Where there is enough available
land, the sides will be sloped llA to 1. Where the available width is
too small for this, retaining walls will be used.
The approach tunnels will be double arches of plain concrete with
ties resting directly on the concrete inverts. They will be water-proofed
by layers of coal tar pitch and felt with 4 inches of concrete or brick
outside of the waterproofing to protect it from injury. The opening for

each track will be 16 ft. 6 in. wide by 18 ft. high above top of rail at
center of the arch. On each side of each opening there will be a bench
2'/j ft. wide and 5 ft. 3 in. above the rail. These benches will serve as
guides for derailed cars, passageways and places of refuge for track men,
etc. They will be accessible from the track by means of ladders in each
wall at intervals of 50 feet.
In building the approach tunnels it is intended to first make three
drifts, one for the center bench wall and the other two for the sides.
After the bench walls are completed in these drifts, timber arches will
be built outside of the lines of the concrete to form a roof over the
rest of the excavation. After these timber arches are built, the rest of
the excavation will be completed and the concrete arch rings and inverts
built. As the masonry is completed, all outside spaces will be carefully
back filled.
There will be two permanent shafts, each a short distance back of
the shore line on each side of the river. They will be of concrete with
an oval opening 13 ft. 6 in. by 16 ft. 6 in. over each tunnel, besides
openings for a stairway, electric wires, etc
Unquestionably the most interesting and novel part of the work
will be the subaqueous section. A number of designs for this were
considered, of which three were submitted to contractors to bid on.
Two of the designs "A" and "B" were for tunnels to be built in
a trench previously excavated in the bed of the river. The third design
was for cast iron lined tunnels, shield driven, and very much like the
tunnels now being constructed for the Pennsylvania Railroad under the
North and East Rivers at New York. The Grand Trunk Tunnel at Port
Huron is also of the same general type.
For design "B" the tunnels were composed of reinforced concrete
tubes supported by a continuous bed of concrete. These tubes were to
be made of very rich concrete and it was expected that they would be
practically watertight. They were to be built on shore with bulkheads
to exclude the water and then launched and towed to the place where
they were to be sunk. Supports of some kind were to be placed at the
bottom of the trench on which the tubes were to be lowered. When
they were accurately placed, concrete was to be placed below and around
them to a level a little above the centers of the tubes. After the con-
creting was finished back-filling was to be placed to a height of about
five feet above the tops of the tubes.
Design "A," a modification of which was finally accepted, was in
a general way similar to design "B." Instead, however, of the com-
pleted tunnel sections being placed, steel tubes were to be used. These
were to be built on snore, floated out and sunk in place and then con-
crete was to be placed around them to a height of about five feet above


6i
Sectional
the tubes. Afterward the water was to be pumped out and an inner
lining of concrete put in each tube. The steel shell was to serve as water-
proofing and also as a form for the outer concrete.
Contractors were invited to bid on any or all of the designs or to
submit bids on designs of their own. A very ingenious design was sub-


mitted by Haney and Miller of Toronto. The subaqueous portion was to
be built above water in complete sections of twin tunnels of reinforced
concrete resting on a timber grillage. Piles for a foundation were t»
be driven in the bottom of the trench and the tunnel sections lowered
on them.
The design finally selected for the subaqueous section was a modifi-
cation of design "A" submitted by the Butler Brothers Hoff Co. of New
York. The steel tubes for this will be made of $i inch plates and in
lengths of about 260 feet. They will be connected together in pairs by
pin joints. At intervals of twelve feet transverse exterior diaphragms
will be provided extending to the outer limits of the exterior concrete.
These diaphragms stiffen the tubes and divide into sections the space
to be filled with concrete. Longitudinal plank will be placed along eacli
side and bolted to the diaphragms. These plank, with the diaphragms,
make pockets, open at top and bottom, in which the exterior concrete
will be placed.
The dredging to a depth of about 60 feet below water is being done
by a dipper dredge. All excavation below 60 feet will be done by a clam-
shell dredge. After a section of the excavation is finished, pile supports
for the tubes will be made at suitable intervals. On these will be
lowered the sections of the tubes. After any pair of tubes is lowered
and connected to the section previously placed, gravel will be deposited
in the bottom of the trench to a depth of about 18 inches and outside
the forms to a height of a few feet. The concrete will then be placed
around the tubes. Each pocket formed by the diaphragms and side
planking will be filled separately, the back filling outside of the forms
being kept a little above the concrete at all times.
The tubes will be built on shore and floated to where they are to
be placed. They will be lowered by derricks placed on boats held in
place by spuds and anchors. In order to relieve the derricks of most of
the weight of the tubes, two cylindrical floats will be attached to each
tube of a size sufficient to carry the entire weight. By admitting water
to the floats any desired weight can be put on the derricks. Detachable
uprights will be put on each tube reaching above the surface of the
water. By observing these it will be easy to determine when the sections
are in proper position.
After the exterior concrete has been placed and allowed to harden
sufficiently, the water will be pumped from the interior of the tubes, any
leaks that may be found will be carefully stopped, and an interior lining
of concrete put in. This will complete the tunnel ready for ties, electric
equipment, etc
The trains will be hauled by electric locomotives, but details of the
electrical equipment have not been determined.


IMPROVEMENTS IN GAS ENGINE IGNITION
J. R. BlBBINS, '99.
In producer work it is sometimes desirable to change the point of
ignition to accommodate different qualities of gas, especially at starting,
when the engine is running lightly loaded. With the usual ignition appa-
ratus it is not possible to change the point of ignition while the engine
is running and the best point has to be determined by trial when the
engine is assembled. This method has proven quite satisfactory when
working on natural gas, and in fact it would be better in many ways to
so arrange the ignition system that it could not be interfered with on
the slightest provocation. But the necessities of producer gas working
have brought about change, and an ignition apparatus is necessary
which will enable the engineer to advance or retard his ignition point
when desirable. Such an apparatus is shown in the accompanying drawing
of a Westinghouse engine.
fig. 1.
Referring to this drawing, the three igniter cams (C) are mounted
on a lay shaft (A) of small diameter supported by brackets (D), posi-
tively driven from the main shaft by a train of gears (B) at one end
and held between two collars (E) at the other. The knock off face (F)
of each of these cams is not cut straight across as usual, but on a spiral.
It is then apparent that if the cam shaft be moved to the right or left,
the moment at which the igniter is released will vary according to the
shaft displacement. The position of this shaft is controlled by a hand
wheel (G) with integral sleeve (H) threaded into the left-hand bracket
(D) and held by a lock screw (I). To change the ignition it is only
necessary to rotate the hand wheel a sufficient amount as indicated by
a graduated scale (J) with index (K), which shows precisely the number
of degrees which the ignition has been advanced beyond dead center.


THE MICHIGAN TECHN1C
The advantages of this adjustable ignition are apparent from the
accompanying curves, summarizing the data obtained from a series of
tests on a c/'xll" two-cylinder Westinghouse gas engine under conditions
of constant speed (300 r.p.m.). constant load (70 b.h.p.), constant quality
of gas (934 b.t.u. per cubic foot), and variable ignition (from 0° early,
i. e., dead center to 55° early). The gas consumption for each test was
measured and the heat value of the gas found by a Junker calorimeter.
fig. 2.
From these observations the b. t. u. consumption per h. p. hour was com-
puted at different points of ignition. Curves A, B and C represent heat
consumption per b. h. p. hour, the overall heat efficiency of the engine
and the corresponding valve opening, respectively.
From a study of these curves the important effect of proper ignition
point is apparent. The efficiency falls off rapidly if the ignition is either too
late or too early. It will be observed that the best point of ignition is
shown from 300 to 35° early. This must not be considered, however,
as an arbitrary figure for engines of this size, for the rotative speed, the
quality of the gas and other influences combine to change very materially
the best point of ignition under other operating conditions. It is the


65
object of this ignition apparatus to make it possible to compensate for
these influences at any time.
How easily this is done is shown on curve C. Note that the valve
opening corresponds closely with the heat consumption curve. The mini-

mum valve lift corresponds to maximum efficiency, hence it is only neces-
sary for the operator to adjust the point of ignition for minimum valve
lift to secure the maximum efficiency of combustion. It is, of course,
assumed that the proper mixture of air and gas has already been obtained.

Curves D and E represent the approximate relation of combustion pres-
sures to ignition. Between 30° and 40°, the rate of increase in pressures
is the greatest; this is a result quite in harmony with other curves.
This adjusting device is particularly valuable in assisting the starting
of a plant when the producer has been idle for some time or just put in
service. At starting, the gas is liable to be sluggish and the compression
low owing to the engine running lightly loaded, which requires in both
cases an advance of ignition; or in normal running the percentage of
hydrogen in the gas may increase highly from some cause producing
abnormally high maximum pressures, which necessitates retarding the
ignition point.


THE NEW 85-TON FLEXURE TESTING MACHINE
H. H. Tibbs.
A decidedly novel testing machine has recently been erected at the
University of Michigan which will doubtless be of considerable interest
to the engineering profession.
The machine was designed by Professor Williams of the Department
of Civil Engineering of the University of Michigan, and was built by the
Russel Wheel &amp; Foundry Co. of Detroit. It is especially adapted to the
testing of reinforced concrete beams and will give a uniformly distributed
load on beams of any size up to twelve feet in length and of a maximum
width of 12 inches. The load is applied by means of hydraulic pressure,
the city water supply being used for pressures up to 40 lbs. per sq. inch,
beyond which a boiler test pump is used with which a pressure of 100
lbs. per sq. inch is obtainable, the total load then being about 170,000 lbs.,
which is the designed capacity of the machine.
The machine as shown in Fig. I, consists primarily of a cast iron bed-
plate three inches thick in which the water space is recessed. This bed-
plate is reinforced by heavy flanges cast solid with it, which have prac-
tically the form of beams of uniform strength. The bed-plate is sup-
ported by two massive carriages each running on four wheels. The load
instead of being applied from above as in most testing machines is applied,
for convenience, from below, so that the knife edge supports of the beam
are located on the upper instead of the lower side of the beam as shown
at D, Fig. 1. From each knife edge the reaction is transmitted through
powerful screws to the carriage supporting the bed-plate. By this means
the forces acting in the machine are balanced, so that no force other than
that due to the dead weight of the machine and test beam is exerted on
the floor or foundation. The carriages of the machine can be moved
back and forth longitudinally under the bed-plate so that the knife edges
which move simultaneously can be separated or brought closer together
to accommodate beams of different lengths. The cross-head which carries
the knife edges can be raised or lowered by means of nuts on the main
screws so as to accommodate beams of varying depths.
The water space of the machine (shown in Fig. 2) extends nearly
the entire length of the bed-plate, and the water is introduced through
a small pipe in one end of the bed-plate. The upper wall of the water
space is formed by a thin rubber diaphragm whose edges are securely
fastened down by a cast iron cap ring which completely surrounds the

water space. This cap ring forms a slot twelve feet long by twelve
inches wide into which the beams to be tested are placed. Between the
rubber diaphragm and the {est beam, however, are placed two, layers of
flexible matting (shown in Fig. 2). The first is composed of a woven
belting twelve inches wide, designed simply as a protection to the rubber
diaphragm. The second is composed of 162 rectangular steel bars %"
wide by 12" long set transversely with respect to the test beam. Though
the distance between the walls of the cap-ring limit the width of the test
beams to 12 inches, this flexible matting which completely fills the space

enclosed by the cap-ring enables a beam of any width less than this to
be tested.
When a beam shorter than that necessary to completely cover the
water space enclosed by the cap-ring is used, the diaphragm and flexible
matting beyond the ends of the beam are prevented from bulging up by
means of fasteners (shown in Fig. 3). These fasteners are made of oak
blocks I4 inch thick, to one edge of which a band of steel is fastened.
This band is bent down over the ends of the block and each end of the
band is provided with a barb which engages a groove in the side of the
cap-ring. Thus by tilling the space between the ends of the beam and the


THE MICHICAN TECHNIC
cap-ring with these fasteners only that part of the rubber diaphragm which
is under the beam is free to rise.
The pressure of the water at any time is given by an ordinary pres-
sure gauge, or in case of low heads by a water column, from which the
total load on the beam can be easily calculated.
At ioo lbs. pressure, the maximum for which the machine is intended,
the theoretical load on the beam is ioo (lbs.) X 14+" (length) X 12"
(width) = 172,800 lbs. The actual load is probably a trifle less than this,
possibly by as much as one per cent, though as yet the calibration of
the machine has not been determined for loads near the maximum. The
capacity of the machine, however, may safely be stated at about 85 tons.
&lt;4.-/7ex/J&gt;/e JVW Afattf/rf. C- Gap ft,no
It is expected that deflections of three or four inches, which are suffi-
cient for the investigation of most beams, may be successfully obtained.
The instruments for the measurement of the deflections have not been
perfected as yet, but the fact that the beam bends up instead of down
will greatly facilitate the determination of the deflections.
The first few tests made with this machine were watched with con-
siderable interest, for their success meant that a simple laboratory means
hitherto lacking, had been devised for the application of absolute uni-
formly distributed loads on beams of large size.
The machine has now been in use for several months, during which
lime a number of tests have been made on beams of wood and reinforced
concrete. The efficiency of the machine, and the ease and simplicity with
which it may be operated, are most gratifying, and it promises to be an
important and valuable addition to the Civil Engineering Laboratory of
the University.

ADDENDA
When this year's Technic Board took up the reins of control it had
fond hopes of being able to make the publication a quarterly. We soon
found however, that lack of experience and of funds were obstacles too
great to be overcome. Then again the class room took a great deal of
our time. It is certain that, much as everyone would like to see the
Technic a quarterly, we shall not see that hope fulfilled until the Chair-
man and Business Manager be given some sort of compensation for the
time and effort necessary to get out such a publication four times a year.
Possibly some hours of credit given these two members would be the
most rational method of payment. However, the problem is one for a
future board.
We are trying this year what we think is a better system for regu-
lating the affairs of the Technic Board. All our funds are to be turned
over to the Treasurer of the Engineering Society, and while our fund
is to be kept separate from the general fund and the library fund, yet
all the money we draw out must be on orders given by our Business
Manager and countersigned by the Secretary of the Society. This change
we think will simplify the reviewing of accounts and will place them on
a business basis.
During the last semester the Engineering Society, while not mater-
ially increasing its membership, has shown unusual activity.
The annual reception to the Faculty and members was held Decem-
ber the fifteenth in the Engineering Building. The evening was enjoyed
by all, but more especially by the students who on these occasions meet
their teachers on a different footing from that of the class room. We
appreciate the value of these receptions and regret the fact that our
financial condition precludes the holding of several during the year.
This year an innovation was introduced in the Society in the way
of holding branch meetings in the various departments at which student
programs are presented. Committees have been appointed to supervise
the holding of these meetings and up to the present time the Civil,
Electrical and Mechanical departments have each held a well attended
and enthusiastic meeting. It seems to be the general opinion that the
new system will serve the double purpose of getting the students more
intimately ecquainted with each other and of giving them some exper-


icnce in addressing an assembly. The latter is recognized by the Faculty
as being of prime importance. They tell us that an engineer's weak point
is his inability to talk while on his feet and since the regular curriculum
does not provide for training along this line it is expected that the new
departure will prove very attractive to the students in general. The only
serious objections that were brought up were the possibility of unfriendly
departmental rivalry and disintegration of the Society into several smaller
societies. These objections were given full consideration and it was
decided to try the new system thoroughly before steps were taken to
make it permanent. It is not intended that the branch meetings shall
supercede or in any way interfere with the regular Society meetings
which will continue as before.
In keeping with the sentiment expressed by some of last year's
officers and members of the Faculty, steps have been taken to secure the
revision of the constitution in order to make it better serve the needs of
the Society and to make it comport with the articles of incorporation
issued to the Society two years ago. A committee was appointed to work
in conjunction with the Board of Directors in drawing up a constitution
for ratification by May I, 1007.
The biography of George Y. Wisner which appeared in the June
issue of last year seemed singularly appropriate and prophetic, appearing
as it did so short a time before nis death. His demise, which occurred
July 3, 1906, has taken from the engineering profession one who did far
more than his share toward the advance of civil engineering and toward
furthering the respect with which the profession is today regarded, and
we are indeed fortunate in being able to give our readers in this issue
some of the benefit of his large experience and sound judgment. His
article on "A Civil Engineer's Opportunities'' shows careful thought, close
observation, and a thorough knowledge of his subject, and merits the
careful perusal and consideration of our readers.

"Good morning, Professor Cooley!"
"Good morning, Mr. Damon, good morning! You're looking the
perfect suburbanite this morning. Beautiful posies!"
"They're the best ever. I've got fifty-seven varieties in my garden
now and as many more to hear from. I want you to come out and see
them. I'll order some fine weather and we'll go "out on the north shore
in the real country and watch things grow."
"Well! thank you. I'll be mighty glad to accept that invitation, and
we won't do as the Irishman did either. Did I tell you about that?"
And then followed a good story and a hearty laugh before I passed
on to my office.


Such was a very usual morning salutation as I reached the office of
The Arnold Company last summer while engaged with Mr. Bion J. Arnold
on the Chicago Traction work.
Mr. George Alfred Damon, the subject of this sketch, now Managing
Engineer of The Arnold Company of Chicago, a man very busy with his
work and his men, always has time for a little small talk and a laugh.
It's a part of his philosophy in fact, and a part that he very completely
realizes in practice—"Be sure to have a little fun every day. Don't put
it off until vacation time. Work hard, work efficiently, but do not fail
to get some fun in with each day's work."
Mr. Damon exemplifies this principle day after day as he sits at his
desk, meeting either his assistant engineers, clients of his Company, or
representatives of other companies. The business and technical instincts
are always evident. The answer to the problem in hand must be obtained
in the most direct way; decisions must be reached quickly and accurately;
matters must be disposed of to make room for the next thing, and yet
through all the intensity and rush of work, the optimistic view, the pleas-
antries and jokes serve to keep everybody happy and very efficiently lubri-
cate the machinery that has to stand the strain incident to the conception
and execution of some of the largest engineering enterprises in the west.
To begin further back with my story, Mr. Damon was born in
Chesaning, Michigan, April 7, 1871. In his earlier years Mr. Damon's
home was in Detroit, and later at Ypsilanti, Michigan. His common school
education was received at Detroit and his high school training at Ypsi-
lanti, where he graduated with the class of 1889. Previous to this time
Mr. Damon's practical experience began as a freight clerk for the Mich-
igan Central Railroad at Ypsilanti, Michigan, his father being connected
with the operating department of that road. Mr. Damon concluded early,
however, that he could serve the railroads better in an engineering capacity,
possibly in the lines of electrification, than in a clerical or operating
capacity. In order to prepare himself for this work sufficient money was
saved to enable him to enter the University of Michigan in the fall of
1890. At this time electric traction was in its early infancy. The only
sign of an interurban line that existed in the State of Michigan at that
time was the "Steam Dummy Line" that made occasional trips between
Ypsilanti and Ann Arbor, the original "Ypsi-Ann" so well known to the
University of Michigan students.
During his college course, Mr. Damon lived in Ypsilanti, making the
daily pilgrimage to Ann Arbor. For three years he followed the fortunes
of the class of 1894, and then fell out by the wayside as it were, the
immediate cause being an opportunity to assist in the placing of the
University of Michigan Educational Exhibit at the Chicago World's Fair


in 1893. He was in charge of this Exhibit from May until July, when
an opportunity presented itself to join the staff of "Electrical Industries"
as reporter for the World's Fair weekly edition. This opening gave him
an opportunity to make a thorough study of the Fair and the electrical
exhibit in particular, which opportunity was improved to its fullest extent.
Incidentally the few months spent in Chicago at this time resulted in an
attack of what may be called the "Chicago fever for doing things," and
at the same time brought definitely to the foreground the problem of
"what to do." The old paradox, "You can't get a job without experience,
and you can't get experience without a job," was brought to his attention
at this time and with it the realization that a satisfactory solution must
be arrived at by some means or other.
Chicago was then in the midst of the hard times of 1893, and all
opportunities for getting experience there seemed to be closed. An oppor-
tunity to make a trip to New York with stops at the largest cities on
the way was offered by a technical paper and was accepted. At Detroit,
while on his journey, Mr. Damon met Mr. H. R. King, Electrical Engineer
for the Fisher Electric Company, builders of motors and dynamos. Mr.
King knew of Mr. Damon's ability as a draughtsman and offered him a
position which gave the long desired opportunity for practical experience.
This incident well illustrates the fact that the ability to do some one
thing well is one of the most valuable assets a young man can have.
The year's work with the Fisher Company was divided about equally
between the drawing room, work in the shop and armature room, and
work on outside wiring installations, all valuable technical experience in
varied lines of work. In the fall of 1894 enough money had been saved
.to return to the University of Michigan and complete the college course.
Graduation had been delayed one year, but the practical experience had
served to fix ideas. A distinct purpose had matured which greatly
enhanced the value of the last year of University work. In later years,
Mr. Damon has become an ardent advocate of such a procedure, and
strongly advises any student who has not had a reasonable amount of
practical training before beginning his university course, to obtain all
the experience possible during the summer months of the college course,
and possibly drop out for a whole year to actually earn money at technical
work. The value of this experience is not in the monetary return, but
in the more adequate conception of the relation of technical training to
actual technical work, and the clearer perception of the commercial status
of technical engineering work, which can not fail to make the last year
of university training far more valuable to any appreciative student.
Among the ideas that were crystallized during this year of practical
work were what Mr. Damon terms some stepping stones to success,—


"Aptitude," "Ambition," Hard Work," and "Staying Put." That the
importance of these qualifications was clearly impressed on Mr. Damon's
mind is well attested by his progress during the years following.
With these ideas in mind the last year of the University work was
put in with a definite purpose in view, and Chicago as a destination.
Money was earned during the year by lettering and draughting and by
getting up advertising designs for the Ypsilanti and Ann Arbor merchants
for whom two very attractive advertising booklets were designed and
published, which netted a very handsome return. Also many numbers
of the "Wrinkle," "Oracle," and "Castalian," published at the University
of Michigan during Mr. Damon's course, contain drawings from his pen.
The thesis prepared at the close of the college course contained an
elaborate investigation of "The Influence of Air Gaps on the Tractive
Power of Magnets," and contained a number of new and unique methods
of exploring and recording the magnetic flux. In later years the line
of work was followed out in connection with problems that came up in
engineering design, and particularly in connection with the perfecting of
magnetic clutches for power house work. Mr. Damon now holds two
patents covering clutches of this type.
Graduation was followed by a camping trip and a delightful summer
spent in designing advertising matter for the Ann Arbor Piano Company.
In September came the long looked for trip to Chicago. This trip had
been preceded by twelve carefully written letters of application, the net
results of which were three replies containing indifferent encouragement.
The morning of September 14, 1895, was an exciting period in Mr. Damon's
history. Decisions were to be reached which possibly would determine
his life's work. The question of a large company versus a small company
was to be decided.
In following up the letters of application by visits to the Chicago
offices samples of drawing were presented, which showed that the applicant
was not wanting a job for experience only, but that he had "goods to
sell" and was looking for the best market, which is, by the way, one of
the best mental attitudes in which a young man looking for work can
approach Chicago. Positions were offered by the Western Electric Com-
pany and by Mr. Bion J. Arnold, who at that time had recently opened
an office in Chicago as Consulting Engineer, and was then doing part of
his own draughting. As to the choice between the large and the small
organization, the decision was made in favor of the latter, the idea being
that a more diversified and independent experience would be possible.
Mr. Damon had early realized that a position could more easily be
held if one made himself so useful that his employers could ill afford
to dispense with his services, and he improved the opportunity to apply


this principle in a variety of ways in his work in Mr. Arnold's office.
The work from the first included draughting, specifications, plans, tests,
reports, and estimates on all kinds of electrical enterprises, ranging from
an isolated plant to a high speed electric line; from an elevator test to
a report on an electric method of separating gold from its ores; from
preparing descriptions and illustrations of technical articles to checking
over claims for patents; from making detailed drawings for an installation
of "The Arnold System" of power station construction to making calcula-
tions for a new system of electric traction; a great variety of work,
requiring not a little of "Aptitude" to meet the diverse problems; a rea-
sonable amount of "Ambition" to determine the very best method of
solution; a liberal amount of "Hard Work" to arrive at the satisfactory
conclusion; and withal the determination to "Stay Put" and work out
the broader problem of "what to do" along the lines determined on.
From the fall of 1895, at which time Mr. Damon became associated
with Mr. Bion J. Arnold, his progress has been very closely identified
with that of the Company he is serving. As indicated above the work
at first was entirely along consulting engineering lines. Later, as it
became possible and desirable to broaden the field of the work, contracts
for construction were taken. To more satisfactorily handle this work,
The Arnold Electric Power Station Company was organized, and Mr.
Damon became Managing Engineer of this organization. During this
period, in addition to the constantly increasing amount of consulting
engineering work that passed through the office, a number of construction
contracts were undertaken, which included the building of the several
isolated power plants, the equipping of the Chicago and Milwaukee Elec-
tric Railroad, and the construction work in connection with the entire
equipment of several large railroad shops. Later the field of construction
work became so varied that it became desirable to change the name of
the organization to The Arnold Company, which Company is today
engaged in the construction of complete industrial plants, including build-
ings, water and sewer systems, together with all of the mechanical and
electrical equipment throughout; the design and construction of electric
railroads, and complete hydro-electric properties, including the generating
plants and transmission lines, substations and secondary distribution.
From Mr. Arnold's small office in the Marquette Building, in which Mr.
Damon started as draughtsman, the organization has now grown to
occupy over a floor in the Borland Building, and to employ over sixty
men in the Chicago office. During the present year, the aggregate of
the work on which The Arnold Company is engaged in the capacity of
engineers or constructors already exceeds seven million dollars.
Throughout the development of the organization from the consulting


engineer's office to The Arnold Company as now organized, Mr. Damon
has been very closely associated with Mr. Bion J. Arnold, and during
the last few years, when much of Mr. Arnold's time has been taken with
large projects in the east, a large measure of responsibility in connection
with The Arnold Company's work has devolved on Mr. Damon, as Man-
aging Engineer. The Company's success is attributable in no small degree
to his efforts and to the definite conception that he has of the work to be
done and the services to be rendered by such an organization to its clients.
Mr. Damon has always been an organization man. He is a firm
believer that more efficient work can be done by concerted action in a
properly organized company than by individual effort. This idea is
carried out in the organization of The Arnold Company, by insisting
on each member of the organization assuming his proportionate amount
of responsibility in connection with the work of the Company, such a
responsibility must be accepted and corresponding results obtained by each
member of the organization. This attitude on the part of the Managing
Engineer is an effective incentive to efficient work, and results in a very
high efficiency for the organization as a whole.
Mr. Damon has always been a very loyal alumnus of the University
of Michigan; he has been identified with the Alumni Association, par-
ticularly with the Engineering Alumni in Chicago ever since his residence
there. He was President of the Chicago Engineering Alumni Association
for the year of 1902. His interest has been shown in a very practical
way in the assistance he has been able to give University graduates just
starting out on their professional career. Having gone through this experi-
ence himself, he very keenly appreciates the position of the engineering
graduate, and has taken no little trouble, not only in securing positions
for them, but in assisting them, as he has often been able to do, in the
way of suggestions as to the best method of following out their work.
Some two or three years ago a very informal and enjoyable banquet was
given to Mr. Damon by about sixty of the students now all engaged in
technical work in Chicago, many of whom he had assisted in some way
or other at the time they started their technical work.
Mr. Damon was married in June, 1904, to Miss Harriet Diller, then
of Chicago, but previously of Ypsilanti, a "Normal College girl." They
are now living at Winnetka on the North Shore, at which place Mr.
Damon has now purchased a beautiful home for the "new Company" in
the organization of which he is actively engaged. At present he has as
assistants George Alfred Damon, Jr., a bright lad of a couple of summers,
who already occupies the position of managing engineer of the Damon
Company. This organization has recently been increased by Miss Harriet


Antha, who has already taken no small .share in the direction of the
affairs of the Company at Winnetka.
In addition to his work with The Arnold Company and the other
demands on Mr. Damon's time, he has always found time for more or
less outside work. After first coming to Chicago he was engaged for
some time in Y. M. C. A. work as an instructor in certain courses of
electrical engineering. He soon became a member of various engineering
societies, having been for some time identified with the American Institute
of Electrical Engineers, the Western Society of Engineres, and the West-
ern Railway Club. He has served on various committees in the first two
noted organizations, and has occupied the office of Chairman of the
Chicago Section of the American Institute.
From time to time Mr. Damon has contributed articles on engineering
matters to the technical journals, and has as well presented numerous
papers before various engineering societies.
During his senior year at the University he presented a paper before
the engineers at the University on the Electrical Equipment of the Steamer
Northwest, this being an account of work with which he had been con-
nected during his year with the Fisher Electric Company. He has pre-
sented papers on "A Modern Power Plant," and on "High Tension Over-
head Construction" before the American Institute of Electrical Engineers;
a paper on "Railroad Repair Shops" before the Western Railway Club;
and papers on the "Design of a Modern Industrial Plant," and on "The
Grand Rapids, Holland and Lake Michigan Rapid Railway," before the
Chicago Electrical Association. Two papers have been presented before
the Western Society of Engineers which have attracted particular atten-
tion; the first on "The Opportunities in the Electrical Business" was pre-
sented in 1905, and received the Chanute Medal for the best electrical
paper presented before the Western Society that year. The last paper
presented before this Society, entitled "What is an Engineer-Constructor,"
was received with great interest, and has been widely noted in the tech-
nical papers throughout the country. In this paper Mr. Damon most aptly
and concisely stated his idea of the advantages of organization as com-
pared with individual effort.
Mr. Damon's style as evidenced in these papers is very clear and con-
cise, and his way of putting things is at once extremely original and most
effective. It is but another illustration of his usual point of view,—a very
pithy statement and an illustration at the same time unique and apt, very
often entirely clears up a situation which before appeared to be quite
complicated. The same clear insight is evident not only in the papers
presented, but as well in the ordinary routine of work in the office. Mr.
Damon's present success is attributable not only to the "stepping stones,"


but in no little degree to this clear insight and to another characeristic
attitude which he sums up in the concluding paragraph of his paper on
the Engineer-Constructor in the following words:
"Such a business as has been outlined can only be built up by the
demonstration of unquestioned ability, and the possession of not only
absolute honesty, but also of those qualities which insure what has become
known as the 'square deal.'"


DUST COLLECTORS—A COMPARATIVE TEST
Harold S. Wheeler, '06, and Augustus Carrier, '07.
Recently the Mechanical Engineering Department of the University
was enabled to undertake a series of comparative tests between various
types of well knewn dust collectors, and knowing that information along
this line is difficult to obtain, and believing that our results will be of
interest to engineers we submit herewith the results obtained from a test
of two of these collectors, with the method used in obtaining the same.
Dust collectors or separators are used for a great variety of purposes
such as cleaning grain and cut alfalfa, feeding saw mill refuse to boilers,
separating facing sand in foundries, etc., and the question which con-
fronts the purchaser is, "Which collector will handle the largest quantity
of material at the least expenditure of power?"
Throughout this discussion the collectors will be designated as "A"
and "B" and we feel justified in saying that both are recognized by the
trade as standard types and not freaks.
The apparatus was placed and connections made as is shown in Fig.
I. Each collector in turn was suspended from a bolt in the ceiling and the
tests were run on them in this position. Air was delivered from a 30"
steel plate exhaust fan through about 15 feet of 9"xis" galvanized iron
pipe with easy turns. The suction side of the fan was connected to 8'
of 13" galvanized pipe having a sliding damper at the outer end for vary-
ing the area of the suction opening. The fan was belt driven from a
220 volt, 20 K. W. direct current series motor, with 20 point rheostat
for varying the input to the motor. 1
The power input to the motor was measured by means of a direct
reading voltmeter and a milli-voltmeter with shunt as is shown in Fig. 1.
The velocity of air passing through the suction pipe was -obtained by the
use of a carefully calibrated Pitot tube placed in the pipe about midway
between the inlet slide and the fan. The suction at this point was taken
by means of a differential draft gauge. The fan discharge pressure was
found by means of a differential draft gauge placed midway between the
fan discharge and collector inlet. A third differential draft gauge was
placed at the material outlet of the collector to measure the pressure or
suction at this point. The fan speed was taken by means of an ordinary
tachometer and varied by varying the input to the motor.


In Fig. 6 the essential parts of the collectors are shown.
In both collectors the material enters at (i), and striking the curved
surface of the shell (2) a rotary motion is imparted. This throws the
material out to the shell where it rotates and gradually drops down and
finally out of the material outlet (3), the air meantime passing upward
and out of the air outlet (4).
Collector A. The air entering at (1) strikes the casing (2) and
travels in a circular path in chamber (5). The construction of this cham-
ber causes a whirl eccentric to the axis of the casing and the centrifugal
force of the whirling air throws the material outward against the casing
(2) and at the same time forward and downward. At (6) the air near
the casing is caused to change its direction by the deflector (7) which
prevents it from going against the entering material. At (8) the
greater part of the material, still remaining in the. air, passes back
of deflector (9) into space (10) which acts as an expansion chamber and
allows the air to pass again into chamber (5) with reduced velocity. The
deflector (9) acts on the air inside the dust area and causes its deflection
into chamber (5) where the eccentric whirl takes place in the area of
the air outlet (4) from which the air escapes. The dust continues its
rotary motion and finally passes out at the outlet (3).
Collector B. The air in this collector, entering at (1), strikes the
casing (2) and travels in a circular path in the space (5) between the
tubular guard (4) and the casing (2). The material is forced to the
casing by centrifugal force and travels forward and downward, the
downward tendency being caused by the weight of the material and the
necessity for the air to pass downward to enable it to pass inside of the
guard (6) and thence to the atmosphere. The air passes upward through
the central chamber (7) inside the guard (6) and Qut the air outlet (4).
The circular plate (8) is placed in the lower part of the cone to prevent
the vacuum, caused by the upward moving air, pulling the material up-
ward with it. The air between the circular plate (8) and the outlet (3)
being practically dead, except for a slight rotary motion, allows the mater-
ial of its own weight to fall down the sides of the cone and out the out-
let at (3).
Procedure of Test. The method of conducting a complete test for
any collector and for any opening is as follows:
It was first desirable to determine the resistance of the outlet duct
from the fan to the collectors and a series of runs at various speeds and
suction openings were made for this purpose. Draft gauges were placed
in the beginning and end of this duct, no collector being attached, and
the loss in pressure found. The amount was found to be so small as to


be negligible and as the tests were comparative, would be the same for
both collectors and would not enter into the calculations.
As manufacturers have adopted certain openings as standards, viz.,
97%. 85%, 76%, 65%, 50%, 41 %, and 25 % it was decided to calibrate the
slide admitting the air to the suction side of the fan and get the same
openings as nearly as possible. The openings we used were 100%, 84.3%,
75.8%, 65.2%, 50%, 41.1%, and 25%.
We now took zero readings on all draft gauges, arranged the slide
to give the desired opening, and started the motor at its slowest speed.
We changed the fan speed by steps of 100 R. P. M. through a range of
from 900 R. P. M. to 2,200 R. P. M. for each opening, and for each speed
took three sets of readings consisting of speed of fan, voltage, amperage,
temperature of room, fan suction, fan delivery pressure, pressure or suc-
tion at material outlet, and lastly, pressure due to velocity on suction
side of fan. From these readings our computations were made.
The input to the motor was calculated from voltmeter and ammeter
readings and the horse power determined by dividing the watts by .746.
In calculating the velocity of the air the formula V = C ^Izgh was used,
where (V) equals velocity, (C) equals the constant of the Pitot tube,
(g) is gravity and (ft) is expressed in inches of water. In our calcula-
tions it was necessary to reduce inches of water to feet of air. This was
calculated as follows: As there are 62.4 lbs. of water per cu. ft. I lb. =
1/62.4 cu. ft. and as 13 cu. ft. of air equal 1 lb. 13 cu. ft. = 1/62.4 cu. ft.
or 811.2 cu. ft. of air equals I cu. ft. of water. Reduced to inches 811.2
cu. in. of air = 1 cu. in. of water and reducing 811.2 to feet, 1 in. of
water equals 67.5 ft. of air. In our calculations we incorporated the 2
under the radical sign, in the formula V = C V(2gft,) with the constant
C making our formula read F = CV(j/i). The method of finding C
wil be shown hereafter. The quantity of air passed in cubic feet per
minute is equal to the suction area in square feet multiplied by the velocity
in feet per minute as calculated above.
With this method of conducting a test of two collectors we have
forty-four readings at each speed, fourteen speeds, and seven suction
openings, making, in all, a total of four thousand four hundred readings,
and with such a large number of readings it is imperative that the results
be discussed through the medum of curves.
Curves. The power, velocity and pressures or suctions for each speed,
suction opening and collector are plotted in Fig. 3. The curves in dash
line are for Collector "A'' and in full line for Collector "B." The curves
designated "H. P." signify the horse power input to the motor. The
curves marked "Velocity" are drawn for the velocity of air input on suc-
tion side of the fan. Curves marked "No. 1" show the amount of suction


in inches of water on suction side of the fan. Curves marked "No. 2"
are drawn for the pressure on the delivery side of the fan, in inches of
water. Curves marked "No. 3" signify the amount of suction or pres-
sure at the material outlet and for our collectors show suction for Col-
lector "B" and pressure for Collector "B."
If one will take the trouble to run through the curves in Fig. 3, it
will be seen that, in the total of seventy curves, there are none that are
the least illogical. Take curves "No. 2" for instance, and run through
them at say a speed of 2,000 R. P. M. The difference in pressure between
the two collectors is shown below.
OPENING PRESSURE DIFFERENCE
% IN IN. HlO
25. 0.8
I.I 1.2
50. 1.7
62.s 2.1
75-8 2.3
84.3 2-4
100. 2.4
Thus it is clearly shown that the difference in pressure becomes
greater as the suction opening is increased. This would be expected as
the amount of air handled increases with increased suction opening.
We will now take up a discussion of the curves in detail.
Curves designated H. P., Fig. 3. The horsepower necessary to drive
the fan increases with increase of speed but the increase in power does
not vary directly with the speed. This condition might be expected to
exist as the resistance to the passage of air does not vary directly with
the speed (see curves marked No. 2), and because the efficiency of the
motor varies, but not directly with the speed. The curves also show
that the horsepower necessary to drive the fan at low speeds is about
the same for both collectors but is somewhat greater for collector "A"
at large suction openings and high speeds. This is due to the lower
resistance and consequent greater air handling capacity of collector "A."
Curves designated "Velocity," Fig. 3. The velocity of the air increases
directly with the speed, for any given opening, because the velocity of
air passing is directly proportional to the peripheral speed of the fan
tips. For increasing suction openings the velocity is always greater in the
case of collector "A" due to the lower resistance and greater air handling
capacity of this collector.
Curves designated No. I, Fig. 3. The suction in the case of collector
"A" is always greater than in collector "B." This is due to collector "A"
passing more air at the same speed and the necessity for greater suction,
with same size inlet, to produce the greater velocity.
Curves designated No. 2, Fig. 3. For any opening the pressure on


the delivery side of the fan increases with the speed, due principally to the
increased quantity of air passed through a structure of constant cross-
sectional area.
The difference between the pressures on the delivery side of the fan,
for any fan speed and opening, is a measure of the difference in resist-
ance of the two collectors for this set of conditions. If the discharge
of the fan is simply into the air, there would be a certain resistance due
to the velocity and restriction of the fan discharge. Introducing a col-
lector introduces resistance and the difference in resistance of the two
collectors is shown by the difference of the readings on the draft gauge.
For all openings the resistance of collector "A" is very much less than
that of collector "B," due to the more scientific handling of the air in
collector "A." As the suction opening and speed are increased the re-
sistance of "A" becomes less.
Curves No. 3, Fig. 3. In the case of collector "A," and for any suc-
tion opening, the material delivery outlet is under pressure, and this pres-
sure increases with the speed and increase of suction opening. In col-
lector "B" this outlet is under suction and this suction increases with the
speed and increase of suction opening.
Curves of power loss saved, Fig. 4. These curves show the percent
of power loss saved for the various openings and speeds. In computing
to obtain these curves collector "B" was used as our unit. The computa-
tions were carried out by multiplyng the static head at the collector inlet,
obtained from draft gauge No. 2, by the velocity of the air passing and
dividing by the horse power input to the motor. This gives a measure
of the percent loss of power. If we let these quantities for "A" equal K
P — K
and for "B" equal P, then, basing our calculations on "B." will
P
give the percent saving of loss of collector "A" over collector "B."
The curves show that for the various openings (the 41.1% opening
which is evidently a critical point being excepted), the percent of power
loss saved varies from 59% to 71.5% at 900 R. P. M. and between 76.5%
and 82.5% at 2,200 R. P. M., the percent of saving increasing more rapidly
at low than at high speeds. These losses are due to dust collector friction
and take into account nothing but the collectors.
Curves of quantities of air handled, Fig. 5. The curves in Fig. 5
show the quantities of air handled by both collectors for the various
speeds and suction openings. The dotted curves are for collector "A"
and those in full line for collector "B." These quantities were computed
by taking the product of the velocity of the air in feet per minute and
of suction opening in square feet. The curves show that in all cases col-
lector "A" handles more air than collector "B," this amount increasing

directly with the speed. This should be true because of the lower resist-
ance and consequent greater air handling capacity of "A."
Curves in Fig. 7. These curves show the power efficiency of each
collector for the various openings and the difference of efficiency in per-
cent. The efficiency is the ratio between input and output where the out-
put equals the static head at the collector entrance multiplied by the
weight of air passing and the input is the sum of the static and velocity
heads at the same place multiplied by the weight of air. The change
in efficiency for various speeds at the same opening is only about two
percent so the average power efficiency for all speeds is taken as the
efficiency of the opening.
The efficiency of collector "B" varies from 60.5% at 25% opening, to
37.5% at 100% opening. The efficiency of collector "A" varies from 88%
to 78% between the same range of openings and the difference in efficiency
varies from 27% to 39%. In both collectors the maximum efficiency is
found at small openings and the minimum at from 75% to 85% of the
full opening.
Curve of Volumetric Capacity, Fig. 8. This curve shows the per-
cent gain in volumetric capacity of collector "A" over collector "B,"
based on collector "B." The points were computed by subtracting the
volume of air delivered by "A" from that delivered by "B" at the same
speed and dividing by volume delivered by "B." As in the curves in
Fig. 7 these percentages for any opening at varying speeds, were practi-
cally constant and the average was taken. The curve shows that the gain
of collector "A" over "collector "B" varies between 7% at 25% opening
and 19% at 100% opening.
The principal reason for collector "A" being more efficient than col-
lector "B" is, that in collector "B" the air must turn through an angle
of 1800 to get inside the tubular guard while in collector "A" it has to
turn through only 90° to get to the outlet. Moreover in collector "B"
the whirling air in the case meets the current of incoming air nearly at
right angles, thereby restricting the air inlet and increasing the resistance
in the collector.
From the standpoint of actual money saving let us assume that col-
lectors "A" and "B" are obtainable at a price of. say, $150 each, and a
fan at about $100, the fan being belt driven from a line shaft. Assum-
ing that collector "A'" is twenty-five percent more efficient than collector
"B" we must use one quarter more power to get the same results from
"B" as from "A." If "A" requires ten horse power, then "B" will take
12^2 horsepower for the same work. If the horsepower cost per year
is $55, the saving of collector "A" over "B" is $137.50. This capitalized
at 6% will represent the interest on an investment of $2,291.67, which

is a very considerable item in any plant. Tims it is very easy to see
why work along this line is desirable in order that the purchaser of a
dust collector may know what efficiency to expect from the collector he
purchases.
It may be of interest to show the method that we used in the cali-
bration of the Pitot tube in order to obtain the value of the constant C
referred to in the beginning of this article.
The calibration was carried out as follows:
The Pitot tube as used in determining the velocity of the air con-
sisted of two separate brass tubes of 3/16" internal diameter extending
through a 1" brass plug which was screwed into a brass flange soldered
to the inlet pipe. One tube extended perpendicular to the current of air


to measure the static pressure and the other was turned on a 2" radius
against the current of air to measure the pressure due to velocity. If a
condition is assumed where there is no static pressure, for instance in the
open atmosphere with a wind blowing, the pressure due to velocity would
be absolutely unaffected by any static condition. But in a place where
there is resistance to the passage of the air, as in a pipe, there is static
pressure, and to obtain the true velocity pressure we must deduct the
pressure due to this static condition. To do this we connect the low side
of the differential draft gauge to the static side of the Pitot tube and the
high side of the draft gauge to the velocity pressure side of the Pitot tube,
and when the tube is placed in a moving current of air the draft gauge
reads directly the pressure due to velocity alone.
The formula for velocity is V=^2gh. We must apply to this a
constant for correcting errors in the Pitot tube so we have V — C V2g/r.
It now becomes necessary to determine (C). This was done in two ways:
first, by carrying the Pitot tube upon the truck over the naval tank at
known velocities, and second, by rotating the tube at known velocities
by means of an arm connected to a drill press spindle.
The calibration by means of the naval tank truck was unsatisfactory
as the pressures due to the air at the velocities obtainable were so small
as to offer a very large error factor. It was first found that the track was
transversely out of level, hence with a differential draft gauge the zero
was movable. This was overcome by taking readings at definite stations
with the Pitot tube opening plugged up. The average of these readings
was taken as the mean zero reading. Then readings were taken for var-
ious velocities at the same station as before, only with the openings not
plugged and the difference between the averages of these readings for any
single velocity and the zero reading were taken as the head due to the
actual velocity. This velocity was obtained by the use of a chronograph
arranged on the truck which was calibrated directly in feet per minute.
As above stated this method was unsatisfactory, principally because the
truck speed was so low (13.9 feet per second) that the corresponding
deflections of the draft gauge (maximum 0.034 inches) were so small
that the corresponding percent of error was very large. However we
think that this method of calibration would be ideal for water work, and
that a similar scheme using a street car or locomotive for air work would
be entirely satisfactory where high speeds could be obtained.
The apparatus for calibration of the Pitot tube as used is shown in
the accompanying photograph. A six foot arm was bolted to the spindle
of a suspended drill press and the Pitot tube rotated at different radii.
The pressure was transmitted through two tubes and the "pressure trans-
fer apparatus" to a stationary differential draft gauge. By this means

we are able to obtain velocities of the tube from 21.2 feet per second to
46.6 feet per second. In order to show how uniform the results obtained
were, we give herein the constant of the tube as obtained for various
velocities. These constants were figured taking 2 from under the radical
sign, i. e., V = CV(gh). From the radius of the arm on which the tube
is rotated and the R. P. M. of the spindle we can figure the actual
velocity (Vi). A value for a quantity proportional to this actual velocity
is calculated from V(g/i), say (Ft). Then we have the formula,
K = CV(gA), Vi — CV, or C—V^/V.t. To get the actual constant of
the tube we divide C by V(2). By this method we obtain values of C
in the formula V = CV(gh) of

Ave. 0.9916 for velocities varying, from 21.2 ft. per sec. to 46.6 ft.
per second. This quantity being so near unity the constant of the Pitot
tube was taken as 1. The actual constant for the tube as the above com-
putations do not take into account V(2) is .99i6/v'(2) =0.7025. (
The apparatus designed for transferring pressure from the rotating
Pitot tube to the stationary draft gauge is shown in Fig. 2. It consists
essentially of a steel spindle (1) placed vertically under the center of the
drill press spindle. This spindle includes two 45° seats (2) for revolving
brass rings. Each seat is provided with a channel around it (3) which
is connected by holes in the spindle to a tube (4 or 5) projecting outward
therefrom. Two brass rings (6 and 7) fit the two 45° seats of the spindle
and revolve thereon. These rings are kept in bearing contact by nuts
and jam nuts (13, 14, 15, 16). Each ring is provided with a hole (8 or 9)
connecting it to the channel in the spindle. A brass tube is screwed into
this hole, providing for connections by means of rubber tubing to the
Pitot tube. Now if (4 and 5) be connected to a draft gauge and (10 and
11) to the Pitot tube placed on an arm perpendicular to the drill press
spindle, and a dog be placed upon the arm so that it will drive (6 and 7)
by means of (10 and 11), we see that any difference in pressure on the
two tubes of the Pitot tube will be communicated, while the tube is
revolving, to the stationary draft gauge connected to (4 and 5). This
apparatus proved to be entirely satisfactory.


COMPARATIVE ECONOMY
Chari.es E. Greene.
There is a special application of the laws which govern the growth
of interest upon money, which application will be valuable to the engineer
who desires to estimate correctly the comparative merits of different plans
and designs. No matter what branch of the profession he may follow,
lie is likely to be called upon to decide as to the relative economy of
two or more structures or machines for accomplishing the same ends.
Some of these structures or machines may be much cheaper than others
in first cost, but their life may be shorter, or the annual expense of
maintaining them greater; and it is often a question of some complexity
to determine correctly which, in the end, is the most economical.
Suppose it is desired to build a structure to satisfy a permanent want,
a bridge, for example. The need will exist longer than the life of the
ordinary structure, and it will be necessary to supply a series of struc-
tures, one succeeding another. The choice of a design may lie between
a stone arch, costing a large sum, but, if well built, lasting for a very
long time and requiring little or no expense for maintenance; an iron
bridge, costing much less, but liable to wear out or to be outgrown by
the rapid increase in weight of rolling stock and requiring some annual
outlay for repairs and painting; and a temporary wooden bridge, or timber
trestle, cheap, but comparatively short lived, and requiring frequent atten-
tion.
Again, in comparing chilled iron with steel-tired car wheels, the same
form of question appears.
It will be advantageous, then, to determine what sort of a structure
will be most economical in the long run. The truest economy does not
necessarily lie in the choice of the plan of least first cost. The element
of time or duration must enter our calculations as well as the varying
cost of different types and materials.
When a structure or machine falls out of repair and becomes unfit
for further use, it is important to be able to decide correctly whether
it is real economy to repair it or to build a new one. In this case the
additional lease of life brought about, together with its cost, must be
compared with the life and cost of the proposed new structure or machine.
Problems of this kind are not always attacked in the same way, and
erroneous conclusions may be drawn unless care is taken to include all
of the essential elements of the problem. Sometimes we sec two struc-


tures compared by simply finding the cost of the number of each necessary
to last a given time. Thus, to take an elementary case, a plank sidewalk,
costing $4.00 per rod, and estimated to last five years, may be compared
with a cement concrete sidewalk costing $16.00 per rod and estimated to
last twenty years. As the second costs four times the' first cost of the
first, the conclusion might be that one was as cheap as the other, but
it would be erroneous, because the question of interest had been ignored,
as well as several other matters which should be considered.
Two machines are sometimes compared by finding for each the first
cost plus the capitalized cost of maintenance, a method which may not
be strictly correct, even when the machines have the same life, and are
worth the same sum when worn out.
It must not be supposed that any calculation will replace a sound
and far-seeing judgment. A complete solution of any problem of this
kind is complicated by a great variety of circumstances. The cost of
materials of construction, of coal, and of maintenance are subject to varia-
tion, and the rise or fall of one of these items makes a change in the
problem differing from that which a similar fluctuation in another item
produces. Also the rate of interest changes and tends to decrease. And
the life of few structures or machines can be stated with reasonable cer-
tainty.
To the far-seeing mind, circumstances, entirely aside from cost, will
sometimes, if not in the majority of cases, fix the class of structure to
be adopted. Such considerations as the fact that rapid improvements
in some branch of industry bid fair to lead to great economy in the
manufacture of certain machines or implements, as has been illustrated
of late years in so many instances in the field of electrical engineering;
or the fact that possible changes in the location of a line of railroad
may be found necessary or advantageous, leading to the abandonment
of constructions which cannot be moved; the trial of methods or plans
which are experimental and the success of which are uncertain, as the
sinking of shafts for ore veins or the driving of wells for the develop-
ment of underground water-supplies;—such considerations as these in
many cases largely influence the decision as to the class of structure to
be adopted.
Then, again, the matter of cost is only one of the questions to be
considered in determining upon any structure, and matters of safety,
inconvenience to public and private interests to be caused by changes and
renewals—as the detriment to business on a street by each process of
repaving—and the question of time in which work can be done, may of
themselves require a structure of a particular kind.
Enterprises are sometimes projected which have limited means and
scanty credit behind them. In such cases a minimum first cost may be


a requisite of beginning to be (existence). The Ann Arbor Railway in
its earlier years is an example where, in the eyes of its promoters, first
cost was everything and comparative economy of small account.
Nevertheless, the question of cost should not be left out of consid-
eration, and, in discussing matters of this kind, every possible aid to a
proper judgment should be invoked.
If the problem is one that concerns two types of structures or
machines, where cost alone is considered, there being no repairs, annual
maintenance or value as scrap considered, it may be handled in the fol-
lowing way:
To find the justifiable outlay for a structure or machine to last a large
instead of a small number of years:
If r = annual rate of interest expressed as per cent, .05, .06, then
(l + r)n = amt. of $1 in n years and capital or cost,
100 100 100 N
C = 100 H 1 1 1- &amp;c. to terms in all.
(l-fr)" (l+r)«« (l+r)3n n
The second term of the series is the sum that will amount to $100 in n
years, at r per cent per annum, compound interest; or the present worth
of $100 n years hence. The third term is the same for 2» years, and so on
Example.—What outlay would be justified to make a structure last
100 years instead of 10 years at 6% compound interest per annum?
log. 1.06 = 0.02531 log. 100 = 2.00000
10 = 0.25310 0.25310
log. 55-83 = 174690
100 100 100" 100
C = $ioo + + H (-(•••+) = $226.
(loo)" (1.06)* (i.oo)- (i.o6)B
That is, we would be justified in spending $226 for every $100 of the cost
of the shorter-lived structure or 126% more.
Example 2.—To last 40 years instead of 10 years, interest as before.
100 100 100
C = $100 -| 1 1 = $204.42
(1.06)" (1.06)* (1.06)-
or about double the money.
The effect of a very long term is shown in Example 3.—To last 300
years instead of 60 years, interest as before?
100 1000 100
C = $ioo-| 1 H (•••+) = $103.12
(1.06)- (1.06)" (1.06)-
or only 3% more. Practically no advantage gained.
Example 4.—If an iron rail will last 5 years and a steel rail 20 years,


in the same track, what comparative outlay, interest at 4%, will be justified?
100 100 100
C = $ioo-| 1 1 = $305.27,
(i.04)s (1.04)10 (1.04)"
or we may pay three times as much for the steel all laid in track as
for the iron all laid. The scrap value of the rails is neglected in this
treatment. Compare the two sidewalks previously referred to.
Example 5.—Suppose an ordinary post and rail fence will last 20 years
and a stone wall 100 years. What outlay will the wall justify, interest
at 5% per annum, on the supposition that the farmer does not desire to
move the stones in any event, for the sake of clearing the land?
100 100 100 100
C = $100 ■] 1 1 1 = $159.26
(1.05)=° (i.05)w (1.05)" (i.o5)M
or 60% more.
Example 6.—Suppose the ordinary railroad tie to last 7 years, and
the squared oak or red-gum 21 years, what outlay will the latter justify,
interest at 6% per annum?
100 100
C = $loo-j 1 = $210.73 or 110.7% more.
(1.06)' (1.06)"
The cost, in all cases, must include all materials, labor, tools, and every
contingent expense.
A municipality that is prosperous can borrow money on better terms
or sell bonds bearing a less rate of interest than a private corporation
or an individual can secure. It will be seen that the current rate of
interest materially affects the result, as well as does the length of time
which the temporary structure is calculated to last.

Thus we see why, in a new country where rate of interest is high, it is
economy to build in a temporary fashion; and why great railroad cor-
porations who can refund their bonds at low rates, find it wise to build
stone arched bridges and substantial stations, from this point of view


alone, without regard to the impression made on the travelling public.
The cost of annual repairs to a wooden structure to last for ten
years would probably be greater than that for a brick structure to last
50 years. Suppose the former to be \l/i% on the outlay, and the latter
1%; then the present value of an annuity for 50 years must be added.
The present value of $1 per annum to come due at the end of each year
for 50 years, to realize 4% = $21.48. The difference between i]/2% and
1% being 'A per cent, V? of $21.48 = $10.74, which being added to the
amount above in Ex. 12, gives $264.85 4-$10.74 = $275.59 instead of.$100.
Another way of determining the comparative value of two or more
structures or machines for a specified object, similar only in the sense
that they would all fill the purpose while they lasted, is by selecting one
whose life is longest, and assuming its cost to be the real value of the
structure. The others in turn can then be compared with the first; thus
we will obtain the value of each structure relative to the cost of that one
with the longest life. The difference between this relative z'alue and the
actual cost of the structure will be the measure of economy or of extrava-
gance inherent in that design.
Provision is made also for the case in which the material of the
structure, after its usefulness as a whole is spent, possesses still a market
value for other uses, thus allowing a rebate to be effected upon the total
cost of the structure.
Let C (cost) denote the cost and assumed real value of the structure
with longest life.
S (scrap or structure) equal probable market value of material in
structure of longest life, after its life has terminated.
N (number) equal its life in years.
V (value) Vi, V&gt;, etc., equal equivalent relative values of other struc-
tures, which are to be compared with the one of longest life.
n, rii, m, etc., equal their respective lives in years.
s, Si, s2, etc., equal market value, etc., of other structures after end
of life.
The amount of $r at compound interest for n years at r (rate) per
cent is (i-j-r)n and for N years is (i-+-r)N.
If the structure of longest life were built, its cost at the end of its
life of N years would amount to C(i + r)N — S. (1^
On the other hand, by making use of a succession of structures with
shorter lives of n years each, the cost at the end of ;t years would be
V(i+r)n—S
At the end of 2n years it would be
V(i+r)n-s+[V(i+r)"-s] (r+r)»=
V(i+r)n+V(i+r)2n_[S+S(i+r)n]


At the end of N years it will be

Example 1.—It is proposed to erect a bridge of 150 feet span for a
railroad. An iron pin-connected bridge will cost $6,900 and will last 85
years. A wooden bridge will cost $4,500 and will last 10 years; if the
latter is covered at an expense of $450, it will last 20 years, which struc-
ture will be most economical, if interest is rated at 6% per annum?

Hence the iron bridge is most economical, although costing the most.
Next in order is the covered wooden bridge, and the least economical of
them all is the uncovered wooden bridge. If the renewal of the structure
is attended with additional expense, by reason of continued use of rail-
road, that additional expense should be added to first cost. The difference
will then be greater than before.
Example 2.—A wooden house has reached a state of dilapidation and
is unfit for further use as it is. With repairs costing $850 it would serve
its purpose 4 years longer, while a new house, if built, would cost $6,000
and would last 40 years. What plan is it more advisable to adopt. Rate
of interest 6%.

regarding the comparative value of structures when their durations are
taken into account.
One fact is clearly pointed out—it is generally a great economy to
make repairs, if possible, rather than to rebuild, and it will be found that
more money can be profitably spent in repairs than would ordinarily be
thought wise.
Although the demonstration assumes, artificially, a comparison between
the cost of a single structure with a long life and one of a series of
structures, similar to each other, but with shorter lives, and we may decide
to build the one or the other; yet when its life terminates, it is not
necessarily advantageous to continue the series by erecting another on
the same plan. The best use of money has been effected in choosing the
first design for the first structure or machine; but after its life is spent,
a certain period of time has elapsed, prices of labor and of materials have
changed, new materials may have come into use, types of construction
have altered and possibly the needs in the structure have become modified;
therefore, fresh calculations with latest authentic data should precede and
aid in the proper choice of each structure in the series, in order to attain
practical economy.
Another and more general way of analyzing this class of problem
is as follows:
A certain structure or machine costs A dollars, it requires the expendi-
ture of R dollars for maintenance and repairs at intervals of n years,
it will last for N years, and, when worn out, it may be sold for S dollars.
A second structure or machine for accomplishing the same object may
be represented as to value by similar letters. Which of these will be
more economical, as a permanent thing, the rate of interest being r per
cent payable annually?
To answer this question we must complete the amount of present
capital sufficient to provide permanently for each of these structures or
machines, and the one which requires the smaller capital will be the more
economical. Or we are enabled to find, by the same method, what the
cost, A', of a (perhaps new) appliance must be, in order that it may be
/


more economical than a similar appliance in use, under various supposi-
tions as to the life, cost of maintenance, etc.
The present capital required for any structure will be made up of
three parts.
ist. A, the cost of the structure.
2d. A sum which, put at interest at r per cent, will increase in 11

years by the amount of R. This sum will be , r being expressed
(l+r)n_l

as a proper fraction. If r = 6%, l+r = i.o6 or i-\
ioo
3d. A sum which, put at interest at r per cent, will amount in N
years to itself plus (A — S); since, at the expiration of N years, the
worn-out structure will be sold for S dollars, there will result a sum
sufficient to again enable one to expend A for a new structure, and have
the original sum remaining, which, in another N years, will amount to
sufficient to purchase a third structure, and so on indefinitely. This sum
A-S

The total present capital involved in the use of any structure is,
therefore,

C = A + + —-

(If the interest at rate r per annum is payable semi-annually, the
above denominators become
(l+r/2)2»—1 and (l+r/2)»N_l( respectively.
In certain cases the formula becomes simplified. Thus if S is so small
as to be practically zero in comparison with the first cost of a new
structure and if R is the uniform annual cost of maintenance, repairs
and attendance, coal bill ,etc, as in the case of a pumping engine, n = I
and we have

which shows that it is not strictly correct, in comparing, as a permanent
investment, let us say, two pumping engines which may be supposed to
be of equal durability, to compare simply the first cost plus the capitalized


cost of operation, since this omits the last term in the above formula.
This term, however, when N becomes large, rapidly decreases, and in
many cases may be neglected. A high rate of interest also diminishes the
significance of the last term.

MAGNETIC LINES OF FORCE
G. VV. Patterson.
To Michael Faraday we owe the foundation on which our knowledge
of electric and magnetic fields is built, but without James Clark Maxwell
as his commentator, we probably should not today appreciate the works
of Faraday. Dr. Johnson would have been known far less had Boswell
failed to write his famous biography. Maxwell, however, played more
than the part of Boswell to Faraday's Johnson, for beyond his work as
commentator on the researches and speculations of Faraday, Maxwell
did more than any other man to build on Faraday's foundation our present
science of electricity and magnetism. It is the purpose of this paper to
call attention to a change, due to Maxwell, in the concept called "Lines
of Force" which undoubtedly has been a stumbling block to many; and to
urge that scientific writers return to Faraday's definition of lines of force.
This idea is represented in symbols by B (when referred to unit area)
and by ♦ when taken over the whole section across the field.
Faraday, in his Experimental Researches in Electricity, vol. Ill, page
417, writes as follows:
3264. I have not referred in the foregoing considerations to the
view I have recently supported by experimental evidence, that
the lines of force, considered simply as representants of the mag-
netic power (3117), are closed curves, passing in one part of their
course through the magnet, and in the other part through the
space about it. These lines are identical in their nature, qualities
and amount, both within the magnet and without.
The italics are mine. He also in section 3165 (vol. Ill, pages 365 and
366) concludes by saying:
All iron under induction must have just as much force, »'. e. lines
of force in its internal parts, as is equivalent to the lines which
fall on to, and are continued through and out of it; and the
same is true, as it appears to me, for any other paramagnetic or
diamagnetic substance whatever. The same is true for the magnet
itself; for a section through the magnet has been shown to be
exactly equal to a section anywhere through the outer lines of
force (3121), and these sections may be taken at the surface of
the magnet where they may be considered as either in the air or
in the magnet indifferently; and therefore alike in size, shape,
power, polarity, and every other point.
The italics are Faraday's.


In an earlier research as to induction in electric fields Faraday (vol.
I, p. 4") says:
I have used the phrases lines of inductive force and curved lines
of force (1231. 1297. 1298. 1302.) in a general sense only, just as
we speak of lines of magnetic force.
The italics are Faraday's.
It appears from these instances and from many others not noticed,
that Faraday did not have the concept of field intensity or strength of
field (which Maxwell and all later writers indicate by ft or H) when
■ he used the expression lines of force (electric or magnetic) and that he
did have in mind the idea of flux, which Maxwell calls flux of induction
and indicates by the symbol 53 and which later writers indicate by B.
Faraday does not seem to have connected these quantities in the form
of an equation with the use of definite symbols to represent the concepts
involved, but we find Maxwell as well as later writers expressing the
relation in the form of the equation
in which m is the permeability of the magnetic medium at the point con-
sidered, air having by definition a value for /* equal to unity. The same
equation, with p- indicating the specific inductive capacity of the dielectric,
would represent the analogous relation between electrostatic field and
flux (or lines of electric force as Faraday called the flux). As a rule
writers use different letters when speaking of electric and magnetic fields,
fluxes (or lines of force) and specific inductive capacity (electric) and
permeability (magnetic).
Now field strength H and flux (Faraday's lines of force) B, are both
vector quantities. They may be compared with stress and strain in a
body under mechanical test, and the permeability j» in such comparison
is analogous to the reciprocal of the modulus of elasticity.
By definition m for air equals unity; consequently in air B and H are
equal numerically, but nevertheless totally different kinds of quantities.
This numerical equality in air has led many writers on dynamo-electric
machinery to state that the electromotive force induced by a conductor
cutting lines of force is represented by
E = Hlv,
when / is the length of the conductor and v its velocity across the lines


of force, all the quantities H, I and v being at right angles to one another.
In fact the equation should be written
E=BW.
. , d*
This second equation is equivalent to E = — ——
at
for a single loop of wire through which the time rate of variation of flux
is d*/dt, ♦ being the total flux (integral of B) through the loop. Want
of distinguishing between B and H, leads to no numerical error in the
case of dynamos or motors, because in an air-gap B equals H in magni-
ude though different in kind; but in the case of the transformer with an
iron core B does not equal H, and ♦ cannot be taken as the integral of H
over the cross section of the core.
In most cases H and B are like-directed vectors and may be repre-
sented by parallel lines. In certain cases, however, H and B must differ
in direction. For instance we may consider a permanent magnet placed
in a field whose intensity is due to the magnet itself. Here we find the
field at points within the magnet directed from the north to the south
pole. The lines of force B (Faraday's) are directed from the south pole
to the north. In this case the field tends to demagnetize the magnet.
Ewing says :*
We may call this the self-demagnetising force exerted by the bar,
since its tendency is to reduce the bar's magnetism.
If wc wish a mechanical analogue, we may suppose a spiral spring inclosed
in a tight fitting case with one end fixed and the other end movable.
Suppose the spring extended by a stress applied at the movable end.
Now suppose the original stress removed. The spring except for the
action of the tight fitting case, would return to its original form, but
the action of the case is to check the return, and we may find a residual
strain (analogous to B) which the stress of reaction of the spring (anal-
ogous to //) is unable to relieve. H and B are in this case oppositely
directed. . A second instance is the case of an armature core revolving
in the field of a generator or motor. The core is not perfectly soft and
dissipates a certain amount of energy in the form of hysteretic loss. It
is evident that the magnetization of the core at each point is not parallel
to the field at that point, i. c. the flux B (Faraday's lines of force) is
dragged around so that B makes an acute angle with H. We may con-
sider the work expended in hysteretic loss as due to the action of a
shearing force H which restrains B from revolving with the armature
*J. A. Ewing, Magnetic Induction in Iron and Other Metals, p. 14,
Par. 15.


core. The permeability m which equals B/H must be represented by a
complex quantity because its effect as an operator on H, is to revolve
the product B forward. From these cases it appears that besides the
most usual case of B and H being similar in direction, we may have
them opposite in direction, or in fact in any direction with respect to one
another. The permeability m may then be positive, negative, or even
complex.
If it is evident from the foregoing considerations that in every case
of production of electromotive force, it is always rate of change of B
and never rate of change of H which determines the result produced.
Should we not, therefore, while retaining the common ascription of elec-
tromotive force to the cutting lines of force, return to Faraday's definition
of lines of force?


THE MODERN TENDENCY IN ELECTRIC POWER
TRANSMISSION
John C. Parker, 'oi.
It is a far cry from the power transmissions of a decade ago to those
of the present day, and if the promises for the future are realized we
may expect, within the next five or six years, strides equally great with
those which have already been made.
It is not so very long since "electric transmission' connoted a com-
bination of wooden poles set at short intervals apart directly in'the earth,
supporting on glass or porcelain insulators, (showing an unmistakable
family resemblance to the bottle glass articles in use on telegraph lines),
rubber insulated wires at comparatively small distances apart. As con-
trasted with such a line, with its rudimentary mechanical and electrical
problems, a modern high voltage transmission is indeed a complex matter.
These transmission systems have come into existence largely in con-
nection with the development of very large hydraulic plants, as in general
the cost of electric transmission over great distances is not justified where
steam generation is necessary. The burden of insulation costs for trans-
formers, generators, switching equipment, lightning protection apparatus
and line construction can only be borne by plants of a considerable magni-
tude, so that the smaller developments had little incentive toward raising
the operating voltage above 2300 volts—or thereabouts. Even with a
large development the use of the higher potential is prohibitive where
short transmissions are contemplated, as in such a case either a moderately
increased loss of power or a heavier copper investment, due to a lower
potential, is much preferable to the big investment involved in a more
costly (albeit more efficient) transforming and switching apparatus.
Considerations of this nature immediately indicate that long distance
high voltage power transmissions must, as well as transmitting large
quantities of power, be devoted to the sale of power in large blocks, so
as to minimize the cost burden imposed on receiving and switching appar-
atus and lightning protector equipment, which is approximately independent
of capacity.
It comes about then that in these modern developments the trans-'
mitting company is likely to be a wholesaler of power, selling to central
station companies, railway companies, and extremely large manufacturing
interests. By virtue of this fact continuity of service is of vital import-


ance, for while on a smaller development an interruption of one feeder
circuit would merely mean the temporary shutting off of a line in one
district in a town or the stalling of one car line, with a large trans-
mission company a whole city or group of cities may be completely par-
alyzed by the interruption of a single transmission line. The possibilitcs
of interruptions are from three sources, these being in the generating
station, in the receiving stations, and in the line itself. These are, of
course, very closely interrelated, and dependent upon one another.
The trouble's which may occur on a line are in general mechanical
and electrical, the former being those due to break down of conductors,
or of line structures, due to climatic condition or interference from exter-
nal objects, the latter being a result, in almost all cases of high potential
difficulties or short circuits. The electrical continuity is effected on mod-
ern lines by insulation of the bare cables from the towers, by means of
large porcelain insulators; those in use on a line with which the writer
was recently associated being some 20" high, 14" in diameter, provided
with three petticoats, and weighing approximately 45 lbs. Such insulators
are tested for approximately one minute at a voltage of 2.V1 times the
normal operating potential of the line; in this instance at 150,000 volts.
In the same way the insulation of generating and receiving station
equipment is carried to the same high degree of excellence. It has been
the practice on work with which the writer has been connected to require
a clearance of at least 2V2 feet between line conductors and ground on
all 60,000 volt circuits, thus maintaining ample space for insuring freedom
from accidental ground connections. In addition to this a few end turns
of transformer primaries are insulated for a strain of five times normal
between turns, so as to offer a fair degree of security against puncture
due to the concentration of strain caused by high frequency discharges.
In many high tension installations the old practice of separating con-
ductors by masonry or soap stone barriers has been carried over from
the lower voltage designs. This the writer believes to be entirely inju-
dicious, as such barriers are for all practical purposes thoroughly good
ground conductors. He has, therefore, in his design, relied entirely upon
ample spacing of conductors, allowing 3 or 3V2 feet between line parts of
different phases, and the space between conductors and ground indicated
above. This makes a station equipment much more straightforward, and
more easily accessible.
In fact the whole tendency in modern, large capacity, high voltage
developments seems to be in the direction of simplification. We are learn-
ing by ample experience that apparatus which is effective in protecting
low voltage circuits is useless with high voltage lines, and that a multi-


plicity of instruments and devices serves to confuse the operator, rather
than otherwise.
It is quite surprising to find how much may be eliminated from an
installation, if one carefully analyses the actual requirements of the case,
instead of accepting traditional practice, although in doing so it is neces-
sary to be guided by the results of experience.
Among the features which we have recently found it possible to give
up, is the extensive system of separating walls between transformers. On
many of the earlier developments individual transformers were placed
in explosion proof chambers, thereby congesting the space about the trans-
formers, and making extremely dark and inaccessible pockets. On the
writer's work transformers are all placed in boiler iron cases, designed
to stand a 90 lb. per square inch internal pressure, and the transformer
cases are left with absolutely no barriers, pits or other separators. Sim-
ilarly the very cumbersome and really dangerous wafer flushing equipments
have been eliminated. The esult of experience is a conviction that oil
installed transformers are not at all inflamable, and that the various
schemes for emptying oil to the sewers or flushing the transformer cases
with water are merely means of courting trouble, by placing within easy
reach of the operator's hands a means for "doing things" under stress of
nervous excitement.
Within the limits of an article of this nature, it is hardly feasible to
speak satisfactorily of lighting protection, which is perhaps the most vital
point in maintaining continuity of service. For various reasons, the horn
type lightning arrester, placed outside the station, seems to be increasing
in favor in some parts of the country, although the various types of spark
gap arresters seem to be quite well thought of by other engineers. Choke
coils are used in varying degrees, ranging from simple kicking coils of
bare copper wire, having very few turns, to the elaborate spirally wound
oil insulated coils of many turns. A quite favorably regarded method of
treating the choke coil proposition consists in the reinforcement of the
line terminals and end turns of the primary windings of transformers, as
indicated in an earlier paragraph.
The mechanical characteristics of the transmission line are in many
ways as much of an advance over earlier practice, as are the electrical.
With the advent of high voltage insulators, which are, incidentally, ex-
pensive in something more than direct ratio to the voltage used, it has
become desirable to use long spans of 400 to 600 feet between the struc-
tures, carrying the line correspondingly high above the ground. As the
wind and ice load on the cables is very largely independent of the diameter
of the cable, whereas the strength depends on the square of the diameter,
small cables require a prohibitively large sag, and hence do not permit the


economic use of long spans. For this reason, even with high voltage lines
long spans are not desirable or possible, except where large quantities of
power are transmitted. The writer recently had occasion to specify towers
for a line transmitting 18,000 K. W. at 60,000 volts, and required 011 this
construction towers carrying the lowest conductor 50 feet above ground,
carrying each conductor in the three phases at 7 feet from the other two.
The conductors were of stranded aluminum of 248,000 C. M. cross section
each. Such a cable when covered with Vi" ice all around would, following
the usual standards in bridge design, be subjected to a pressure of 15 lbs.
per projected square foot, or 2.2 lbs. per running foot of cable, which for
550 ft spans and three conductors gives a lateral strain on the top of each
tower of 3,630 lbs., in addition to which the tower has to withstand a wind
pressure on its own surface of 30 lbs. per square foot of projected wind-
ward surface, and 15 lbs. per square foot of projected leeward surface.
A factor of safety of two is specified for these structures, and they
are actually tested with a dynamometer to determine whether they meet
the specifications. In view of the long slim compression members used,
such a specification is really the equivalent of a much higher factor of
safety, as the elastic limit of these towers is essentially the same as the
ultimate strength. Towers are anchored to reinforced slab foundations,
and are in general not provided with guys. These long spans require a
careful calculation of the sags to which the cable can be strung. The
earlier practice of allowing linemen to pull the cable up until they look
"about right" is impracticable on these more recent constructions, which
are in fact engineering structures. The sag is quite materially affected
by the size and material of the conductor and by the temperature at which
the stringing is done. In a climate where ice cannot form on conductors
the conditions are quite radically different from what they are in our
Northern climates. A discussion of the mathematics of these line calcu-
lations is out of the question here, but such discussions can be found
worked out to a greater or less degree of nicety in various publications
of the last two or three years.
Turning our attention now for a few moments to the matter of re-
ceiving equipment, we come to what is perhaps the most interesting feat-
ure of the large capacity transmission equipments. When it is remembered
that the lines are constructed for the sale of very large quantities of
power, and that the whole output from such a large generating station
cannot be taken by one or two communities, it becomes obvious that the
lines must extend over a very considerable range of country, and that con-
siderations of line drop become very important. Not only must the effi-
ciency of the transmission be considered but the constancy of the voltage
must be taken into account as well. The worst possible combination for


the transmission company and for the various consumers is where a large
customer located at the extreme end of the line takes rapidly and widely
fluctuating quantities of power at a low lagging power factor. The power
company can by the variation of its generating voltage hold a reasonably
constant voltage at either end of the line, or at some intermediate point,
but is powerless to hold constant voltage at all points of the line. It.
therefore, becomes imperative that the individual customers be required
to install transforming and utilizing equipment, which will give as nearly
unity power factor as possible, and that the amount of current taken be
held with a very few percent of a constant quantity.
Almost the whole expense in hydraulically generating, and in trans-
mitting electrical power consists of interest, depreciation, taxes and main-
tenance on the first investment, and labor charges which are a constant
quantity practical}- uninfluenced by the amount of power put out from the
station.
In view of this, hydraulically generated power is, if sold in such a
way as to give the fairest terms to all purchasers, disposed of on what
is the equivalent of a peak load basis, i. c, each customer pays a rental
for his share of the generating and transmitting equipment, and takes
what power he needs within the capacity of the equipment rented. A
customer using power at $30.00 per h. p. per annum and at 30% load
factor will roughly speaking pay $100.00 per h. p. per year for actual
power used. This consideration slightly affects the selection of receiving
equipment, and naturally influences the method of handling the received
power by the purchasing company. In consequence of the inevitable volt-
age variations, and the necessity for the maintenance of a proper power
factor, as well as in view of the desirability to the customer of properly
apportioning load between the purchased power from the long distance
transmission line, and locally generated power from steam plants, which
he may operate to carry peak loads, some form of converting apparatus
must be used, which permits the meeting of these various demands without
mutual interference. Where power is used locally for lighting purposes
it is in general distributed at 60 cycles, whereas transmitted power is likely
to be received at 25 cycles, whereby frequency-changing motor-generator
sets are necessary. These will in general be synchronous motor driven,
and by proper adjustment of the motor and generator fields all the ends
indicated above can be obtained.
Where power is used for distribution to an Edison D. C. system, or
to a railway system, rotary converters offer a convenient method of con-
version, but in this case will in general require some auxiliary apparatus
to give greater flexibility in the way of phase control, voltage regulation
and equalization of power demands. This is sometimes accomplished by


the insertion of induction boosters, or auxiliary alternaters on the A. C.
side of the converter. A motor generator set with a synchronous motor,
and a direct current generator may equally well be used, although with the
Edison three wire system, this offers the disadvantage of requiring a
balancer set for the derivation of the neutral.
The method of purchasing power influences as well the conductor
section used, as, for economic conditions, the copper sections must be so
chosen as to give the best economy (considering power loss and invest-
ment charges) when peak load is being carried, in view of the fact that
it is for this load that the customer pays. This applies only beyond the
point at which the customer purchases his power. On the transmission
company's side of this point, a somewhat different condition obtains,
since, within reasonable limits, it is a matter of indifference to the power
company how much power is dissipated in the conductors, until this amount
of power becomes so great as to appreciably interfere with good voltage
regulation, or to limit the capacity of the transmission lines—in other
words to prevent the taking on of additional contracts—then the same
conditions will obtain as for the purchaser's conductors. In any large
development such a condition is always removed to a point of time some
distance in the future from the inception of the development.
In offering these few very general notes, the writer is conscious that
they are subject to very material exceptions, and that they, at best, merely
skim the surface. He has not felt it to be desirable to go too intricately
into the details of any of the points, but rather to present a general
sketch of the subject as a whole, as it seems that this will be most desira-
ble for those readers of the Technic who are not specializing in electric
power work. To the specialist, the writer cannot hope to speak with any
degree of authoritativeness, as he will already realize all that the writer
could contribute in the matter.

AERIAL TRAMWAYS
James N. Hatch, '92.
The present advanced state of civilization is generally conceded to
have been made possible largely through the use of the ingenious labor
saving machinery now in vogue. Manifestations are seen on every hand
of the great mechanical genius which has met and solved problems in
transportation and manufacture that are almost beyond comprehension.
But what is actually seen is only a tithe of what has really been accom-
plished. The achievements of the mechanic arts are not of a nature to
attract that attention which their importance would seem to warrant. The
reason for this is not hard to discover, so much of what is accomplished
in this line being hidden away where the ordinary individual will never
notice it. Real mechanical genius does not flaunt itself from the house
top or cry on the street corner nor babble in the market place, but is
hidden away beneath the rivers or under the pavement of our cities;
down in the mines, or in the most remote fastness of the mountains, or
the desolate waste of the desert. If we would find what is being accom-
plished in invention we must peer into the hidden places and inquire
diligently among the inconspicuous objects, and hunt up the least con-
spicuous persons among the great world of thinkers.
Another reason that we do not appreciate the ingenuity that has been
epended even on some of the great enterprises is that it is very often
among the lesser details that the gravest obstacles have been encountered
and overcome. It is not always the great contrivances that entail the
most ingenuity, but often those things which seem mere tributaries to a
great accomplishment are the very things that make the great achieve-
ment useful. It is often the minor details that make the difference between
success and failure in many a great enterprise. To a remarkable degree
is this true in the great problems of transportation. The methods of
transporting heavy materials from the place where nature has deposited
them to lines of railroads or steamships is often a much more important
problem than the actual carrying of the articles to a remote market after
they are once loaded.
Among this class of tributary carrying and loading devices, the wire
rope tramway, although probably as little known as any branch of the
great labor saving machinery, performs a very important part in the great
system of transportation. Its uses have thus far been confined mostly


to the short auxiliary lines of transportation, although many schemes have
been devised for using the same system on more extensive lines, which
have anticipated the carrying of passengers as well as freight. None of
these schemes has been put into effect on a large scale although many
experiments are still in process looking to that end. The use of wire
rope tramways, or aerial tramways as they may more properly be called,
has filled a place in the great industrial system of the world that no other
known device could replace, and has rendered many problems, that could
not have been solved on a commercial basis in any other way, extremely
simple.
On level, unbroken country where there are few obstructions and
land is cheap, the aerial tramway is not employed to any great extent,
although it is not certain that its use even in such a location would not
in many instances be more efficient than the surface roadways now em-
ployed, but in a rugged, broken, trackless section X&gt;i country, where for
various reasons a surface road would be inordinately expensive, if not
absolutely impracticable, the aerial tramway fills a unique position in
the country's economical system of transportation. The very nature of
this branch of transportation is such, that it is not apt to make itself con-
spicuous by exhibiting its performances in the great centers of population.
To find notable examples of the aerial tramway one must hunt among the
mining districts in the deepest solitudes of the mountains, or along the rock-
bound coasts where no passenger vessel dares approach. Or he may find one
spanning an unnavigable river in some lonely glen or working on some
new engineering enterprise in the frontier. On a careful search there
may be found many remarkable examples of these swinging tracks, carry-
ing their cars rapidly along, high over the tree tops; across the bottomless
chasms from cliff to cliff; up and down the mountains as easily and noise-
lessly as the spider skips along his slender web, the prototype of the rope-
way. Avalanches, snowdrifts, landslides, high water, or even forest fires
are not likely to interfere in the least with the gentle even tenor of their
way. No conductor or brakeman are necessary on these railways, for
everything works automatically. The car dumps where it is intended
it should by means of a trip; or switches off, or stops, or does whatever
else is expected of it without any further direction than that given by
the man at the engine. One advantage that may be noted here, that a
ropeway possesses over a surface road, lies in the fact that the load being
suspended in the air, may be dumped directly into cars or ships, or placed
in elevated bins from which it may be loaded without any further handling.
This often constitutes a great saving over surface roads.
The accompanying illustrations will serve to give some idea of a few
of the uses to which aerial tramways are put, and the nature of the

country in which they have proved themselves invaluable. There are a
great number of different systems, each intended to do some special line
of work. It would probably be difficult to find any two lines that did
not differ to a considerable degree. Some are designed to carry heavy
loads for short distances, others to carry light loads for long distances.
Some work entirely by gravity, the loaded buckets descending, pulling the
empty buckets back to the starting place. It is obvious that in this system,
the starting place must be at a considerably greater elevation than the
terminal. Some systems have but one rope to which the buckets are
rigidly fastened. This rope moves, and acts as the haulage rope as well
as the carrying rope. Others have the carrying rope immovable and
employ an auxiliary rope to haul the buckets along the fixed rope. Some
are designed for rapid speeds and some for slow speeds; some for very
long single spans of over 2,000 feet, while in others no such spans are
necessary.
The aerial tramway is no new thing. It has been employed since
the time of the early Egyptian builders, in one crude form or another,
but it was not until the introduction of the wire rope that its modern
usefulness was made possible. As the wire rope was a product of the
nineteenth century, it will be seen that the possibility of such tramways
as are here described did not exist until a very recent time. In fact none
of these plants shown have been in operation more than a dozen years.
In Norway, a simple form of aerial tramway is used extensively for
a great many simple domestic purposes. The farmers send their farm
products from the little mountain meadows, away up near the snow line,
down into the valley, by means of a primitive style of aerial tramway.
Firewood and many other commodities are also sent down from the
mountain tops in this way. But it has been only in recent years that
the value of aerial tramways has been appreciated for use in carrying
great loads.
In America—to which country this article will be confined—aerial
tramways are used for carrying and loading almost every kind of heavy
materials. They are put to such uses as carrying stone from inaccessible
quarries to railroad lines; carrying quartz rock or other ores to the stamp
mills; logs to the sawmills; loading vessels at points along the shore
where there are no harbors; for coaling vessels at sea; for carrying com-
modities over impassable fields of ice and snow. When the North Pole
is discovered, some Yankee will no doubt climb to the top of that much
sought landmark, and fasten the end of a cable which will reach to the
head of navigation and make a permanent tourist route across the great
ice field of that frozen zone.
A very interesting example of the aerial tramway is one recently


down to the valley below. This tramway has a length of not quite one
installed by the American Mining Co. at Ouray, Colorado. This line is
used for carrying coal from the mines, on an almost inaccessible bluff
mile and a fall in that distance of nineteen hundred feet. The first illus-
tration shows the line from the upper terminal at the mine entrance, to
an intermediate station about 500 feet below where there is another small
entrance to the mine. Buckets may be taken off or attached at this
intermediate station or they may pass on through to the upper loading
terminal, or the loaded buckets from the upper terminal may pass directly
through this intermediate station, on down to the lower terminal without
any interruption. There is much danger from snowslides at this inter-
mediate station, and the whole station is covered by a snow-shed 80
feet long. The second illustration shows a portion of the line from
a point below the intermediate station, to the lower terminal. In this
view is shown one of the remarkable features of the line, a clear span of
2100 feet, over three-eighths of mile. This is one of the longest clear
spans ever built on which loaded buckets are carried. The buckets used
carry about 500 pounds each. The line was designed to deliver at the
lower terminal 70 tons of coal per day of ten hours, but this capacity
could be readily increased by increasing the number of buckets. In this
line there is a stationary carrying cable and an auxiliary haulage cable.
The buckets are hung on a carriage which has two grooved wheels. No
power is required to operate this plant as the loaded buckets descending
develop more power than is required to haul the empty buckets up.
The illustration showing a part of the tramway at Telluride, Colorado,
gives a very good idea of the wild desolate mountain country in which this
sort of machinery figures most prominently.
The Silver Lake Mining Co. have an interesting tramway at their
mines near Silverton, Colorado. This line is used for the transportation
of gold and silver ore from their mines to the railroad, a distance of
14,600 feet, or nearly three miles. The capacity of this line is about 30
tons per hour, and the descent is so great that an actual surplus of work
of about 50 horsepower is developed. Starting out from the loading ter-
minal, the line ascends a mountain slope for a short distance, until it
rounds the crest of the mountain when it pitches down the opposite side
on an inclination of nearly 45 degrees, crossing snow slides in long spans,
one of which is 2,200 feet, which is said to be the longest span of any
similar tramway in the world. There are but nineteen supports in the
first two miles, making the average space between supports, excluding the
long span referred to, over 300 feet. A ^-inch patent locked wire rope
is used for the carrying cable both for the loaded buckets going and the
empty buckets returning.

In the tramways thus far considered the requirement did not demand
the very rapid handling of material, but examples are not wanting to show
that this kind of machinery may be very economically used for the rapid
transportation and loading of coal, iron, ore and similar materials. The
illustrations of the Royal Coal and Coke Company's line at Prince, West
Virginia show an instance where an aerial tramway is successfully used
in the handling of 800 tons of coal per day. The mines are located on
a steep mountain slope on the soutk side of New River, and the tramway
conveys the coal to the C. &amp; O. Railroad on the opposite side. The total
length of the tramway is 2,800 feet, and the elevation of the mine above
the point where the coal is unloaded is 820 feet. Not only does this work
without any power, but the loaded buckets descending overbalance the
empty buckets returning to such an extent that when- running to the full
capacity of the plant, 80 tons per hour, there is actually developed a sur-
plus of about 50 horse power. In other words it would require a 50 horse
power engine working against the cable to stop its motion when running
to the full capacity of the plant. This coal is not only conveyed through
this distance, but is loaded directly onto the cars on the opposite side of
the river. The cost of the total operation would not exceed, three cents
per ton and would probably be much less.
The adaptability of the aerial tramway to the loading vessels along a
harborless coast is evidenced by the line of the Trinidad Asphalt Co., at
La Brea, Island of Trinidad. The asphalt is obtained from pitch lakes
which are quite soft near the center of the lake, but are hard enough near
the shore to bear considerable weight. The loading terminal is located at
a point upon the edge of the pitch lake, and the discharge terminal is an
iron pier 350 feet long built out in the deep water, 1,750 feet from shore.
The fall from the lake to the shore is but eighty feet, not enough to make
the line workvby gravity alone. «When the line is working at full capacity,
which is about 75 tons of asphalt pitch per hour, an additional power is
required which is suppied by a 20 horse power engine. When the re-
turning buckets arrive at the loading terminal on the shore of the lake,
they are detached from the tramway and placed upon small cars, each
car holding two buckets. These cars run on a track laid out upon the
firm portion of the surface of the lake. In order to avoid the slow sub-
mergence of this surface road, which would ultimately have occurred,
the asphalt gradually yielding to a heavy weight, the rails are laid on a
corduroy of palms, resting on a mattress of cocorite palm leaves. At
certain points, guy lines extend to anchorage on the shore, to keep the
track in place. At first it was contemplated extending the rope tramway
out over the surface of the lake with branches to the diggings, the whole
being supported upon the firmer portion of the lake surface. It was dis-


covered, however, that the whole mass was n slow motion, the movement
only being: discernable after a lapse of long intervals, when iU was made
apparent by the changes in relative position of small islands and other
objects.
With this system of conveying, the asphalt is handled but once, being
dumped directly from the buckets into the hold of the vessel. Before the
introduction of the ropeway, the asphalt was first loaded into carts and
hauled down to the shore where it was loaded upon lighters and taken
out to the vessel. It was then hoisted aboard and emptied. It will be
readily realized how great a saving is made by the use of this improved
machinery.
As has been said, aerial tramways are designed to meet many different
conditons. Where the topography of the country is very changeable as
is a plateau country, it is sometimes found convenient to arrange the
carriers so that they may either run along the ropeway or may come to the
ground and run on a surface track. To accommodate such cases, a system
has been designed, in which the carriers are small cars provided with
two sets of wheels, one set for the ropeway and another for the surface
track. In this system two parallel ropes are provided instead of a single
rape, correspondng to the two rails of the surface road. The auxiliary
rope wheh is employed to haul the cars, is generally continuous from end
to end of the entire road and hauls the cars on the surface track as well
as on the ropeway. Where mining or quarrying is done in a horizontal
or inclined shaft the cars may be brought along the shaft from the
depths of the mine to the surface on the ordinary mine tracks; they can
then run onto the rope tracks and be carried across any deep canyon or
chasm, or over any river that happens to be in the road. They may again
come down to the surface on the opposite side of the chasm and run
along a level plateau for a number of mttes and again be taken across a
valley, or from the sheer bluff of the plateau down into the valley. The
dumping is accomplished by a trip which unlocks the hinged bottom of
the car allowing the load to fall. This unloading may be done anywhere
along the line, wthout stopping the car.
The loads that can be conveniently carried on the ropeways as de-
scribed thus far will seldom exceed one ton and in most cases are from
500 to 750 pounds. Greater loads cannot well be carried on account of
excessive sag of the rope. There are cases, however, where there is no
objection to considerable sag and where very heavy loads may be handled.
But in such plants it is seldom practicable to use any intermediate sup-
ports, and so systems where very heavy loads are handled are generally
composed of but a single span. Such a rope conveyor was used in the
construction of the Connecticut River dam at Holyoke, Mass. The


clear span was 1,615 feet, which was at that time the longest ever used
by such a conveyor. The load carried was 6'A tons of rock. The towers
were 100 and 126 feet high respectively.
Another somewhat similar tramway was constructed across the Sus-
quehanna River at Glen Union, Pennsylvania, and was used as a car
ferry. The span was 735 feet and the load carried 15 tons. The carrier
in this case was a wrought iron lattice-work cage, 36 feet long, provided
with railroad tracks much like a miniature car ferry boat. The car was
placed so that the tracks on the cage matched those of the railroad, the
loaded cars were then pushed out upon the cage, when the cage and car
were picked up and carried across the river and let down so as to join
with the tracks on the opposite side.
The system just described where a single span is used adapted to
heavy loads, is most admirably adapted to canal work or ditching, and was
used extensively on the Chicago Drainage Canal. Where the earth to be
conveyed is of a loose gravelly or loamy nature a special shovel bucket
may be brought into use which scoops the dirt up much like an ordinary
road scraper. It is necessary to have a special arrangement of ropes
where it is intended to do scooping. The bucket is lowered to the ground
and by means of a rope which lies along the ground, from the engine the
scoop bucket is drawn along the ground until it fills itself, when by
means of another rope it is drawn into an upright position and latched
in that position, when it may be carried away and dumped where desired.
The whole machine is arranged so that it may be moved along parallel
to the canal as the work progresses.


THE U- OF M. PRIVATE BRANCH TELEPHONE
EXCHANGE
Razlemond B. Parker, '05.
Telephone service on the Campus is now a reality. Some sixty odd
pairs of telephone bells jingle in the offices of our different professors
and officials and the business of the University has received an accelera-
tion which is, after all, only a part of its natural growth. These are days
of higher pressures; higher steam pressures, higher feed wire pressures,
higher business pressures, and it is only natural that the University par-
take in this advance. The telephone is merely an instrument in this
progress. But with its own telephone exchange on the Campus and its
own telephone girls ready to give service night and day, the growth in
size, importance and progressiveness of the University is indicated.
The planning for the equipment and the actual installing was done
by the Michigan State Telephone Company, which is the Bell operating
company for the state, and the switchboard apparatus was made in Chi-
cago by the Western Electric Company. The switchboard is located in
the Electrical Department of the New Engineering Building near the main
entrance to the building. The construction work was started in the fall
of 1906 and the entire equipment completed in March, 1907. All of the
buildings on the Campus and the Hospitals have from one to several
telephones in each and all the circuits are carried in lead cables through
the heating tunnels. The telephones, sixty-six in number at present, are
located as follows:

It might be thought that the equipment of a private branch exchange
for the Campus would not offer any greater difficulties or be radically
different from many offices of the same size and character which may
be found throughout the country. Many American hotels have an equip-
ment of the same capacity where a single position board is sufficient to
handle all the business. But the character of this private exchange may
be better understood when it is known that it is practically a complete


central telephone office in itself, comprising a multiple switchboard of
standard type, a relay rack; a main and an intermediate distributing
frame; a storage battery with a charging set, and a fully equipped wire
chiefs desk for testing purposes. Furthermore the telephone company"s
engineers have gone to the trouble to design a skeleton telephone circuit
showing all the operations and signals necessary for the establishment
of connection between two subscribers using the common battery or cen-
tral energy system. This has been mounted in a cabinet so that all the
wires may be traced and a complete study may be made of the circuits
completed from the time that one subscriber removes his receiver from
the hook until they are through talking and the receiver is replaced.
It is thus ^een that the exchange is ready to give "service, but at
the same time it Jias an ample equipment for educational purposes for
the students in electrical engineering and especially those taking tele-
phone courses. This was the special desire of the Regents and the tele-
phone company and the room with its equipment will be used as much
as possible by the senior classes in Telephone Engineering.
We come now to the switchboard proper. It is a Western Electric
Standard No. I board, finished in mahogany, with an ultimate capacity
of 300 telephone lines or 1,200 subscribers with a four party line service.
At present sixty-six Campus lines and five trunk lines terminate at the
board. The trunk lines arc used to give service between Campus tele-
phones and subscribers connected with the main telephone office down-
town. The ultimate trunk line capacity is ten, so there is an ample
allowance for future extension and growth of the service.
The relay rack on which are mounted the automatic switches and
devices for controlling the trunking and line circuits is placed directly
at the right of the switchboard and in front of the distributing frames
where the subscriber's line wires entering the office are arranged in a
symmetrical manner. These frames are connected to the switchboard
by wire cables and all the circuits are exposed and made as evident and
clear as possible for demonstration to the students. The main distributing
frame is equipped with carbon-mica lightning arresters at which terminate
the wires from a 200 pair lead covered cable leading to the main cable
box and through which pass all lines entering the office. Fig. 2 shows the
cable distribution in the heating tunnels under the Campus and the lines
to the Hospitals. The size of each cable, size of wire in each cable, and
wire numbers are indicated. It is needless to say that there is plenty
of room for future growth in the number of telephones on the Campus.
The electric current required for talking and for the operation of
the signals and relay magnets is supplied from a n cell 24 volt storage
battery of 60 ampeTe hours capacity which is sufficient to maintain tele-

phone service in the exchange for several days without recharging the
battery. This battery is mounted in an enclosed cupboard in the switch-
board room. The battery charging current is supplied from a mercury
arc rectifier of 10 amperes capacity which changes the alternating current
supplied from the city lighting circuit to a direct current at the proper
voltage to charge the battery'. Standard switch panels with measuring
instruments are provided and mounted near the battery cupboard.
Probably the portion of the exchange equipment which will be of the
greatest benefit to the students in telephone work is the wire chiefs test
desk. This is a Western Electric No. 5 set furnished with a Weston
0-50 voltmeter, a telegraph sounder, cords and plugs, keys, and jacks, so
that the electrical condition of any subscriber's line entering the office
may be determined. Such tests are for breaks in the wires, crosses
between wires, grounds, and other troubles which telephone men have to
deal with. This testing desk is connected by wires with the distributing
frame where all the lines end so that any line entering the office may
be transferred to the control of the testing operator who locates the fault
if any. It is only a step from these simple determinations to those of
line resistance, insulation resistance, and electrostatic capacity which are
of greater interest to the telephone engineer and the wire chief's equip-
ment will be a great help in instruction to the students because of the
many combinations of circuits which it readily permits.
The fir,st count, or pig count as it is technically known, of the total
number of calls handled by the University Exchange was made April
10 by the telephone company as part of its regular maintenance duties.
The total was 682 calls from 7 a. m. to 9 p. m. and this number includes
calls originating with main office subscribers who desired connection with
Campus telephones. There were 75 "board" calls or calls between Campus
telephones, which number is very small compared with the total, but may
be partially explained by the fact that a Campus directory was not then"
published and by the newness of the exchange. Since this count divides
the calls by hours we may easily plot curves showing the variations of
the load from the opening to the closing hour as indicated in Fig. 3.
These curves show the "board" and trunk line calls and both curves
have two very decided "peaks" between 9 a. m. and 10 a. m., and 3 p. m.
and 4 p. m.; there is a smaller increase in load between the hours of
7 and 8 in the evening. Likewise periods of light load may be noted at
noon and between 5 and 6 o'clock in the afternoon. Fig. 4 shows similar
curves for May 10, one of the May Festival days, and there is a very
decided load all day. It may be noted that the number of "board" calls
has increased very decidedly over that recorded on April 10. The "peaks"
indicate very plainly when the business of the University is done and

they correspond very well with the corresponding load curve from a
telephone exchange in a large city.
The original plan for the "Varsity Exchange," as it is now known,
when outlined by the telephone company did not call for the extensive
equipment as outlined above, but simply an office for doing a telephone
business. It was only when the educational advantages of an exchange
in the Engineering Building were discussed that a more complete equip-
ment was desired by the Regents, and the telephone company is to be
commended for the thoroughness with which they have executed the work.
The University may now claim the possession of the most complete
Private Branch Telephone Exchange in the world.


ADDENDA
With the next issue we start the custom of placing the names of all
members of the Engineering Society in the Technic. This custom, it
seems to us, is commendable, since the Technic is the official organ of
the Society, and as such should contain everything of interest pertaining
to it. Then too, it has the advantage of precedent in that the names of
members of the majority of such societies appear in their publications.
It does not seem best to us to put the business address and occupation of
each member in this publication on account of lack of space. However
we would like to receive suggestions from graduate members on this
point.
The Technic is not published for the purpose of knocking or of
giving advice to the Faculty, nor is it an organ for the expression of
student sentiment in the Engineering Department. Yet since there is
practically no other place where such sentiment may be expressed we may
perhaps be pardoned if we say just a word about a matter in which all
of us are vitally interested. We refer to the matter of holding up such
a very large proportion of students in a few of our harder courses. It
seems to us, looking at the matter perhaps, from the biased viewpoint
of the student, that when over 50% of the students in any course fail to
pass, that there is something radically wrong somewhere, though it
would take abler, older, and more experienced men than ourselves to
say just where. We know of course that the realization of the diflficulty
of passing a course acts as an incentive toward better and more thorough
work in that course, but will not a very real harm result if this principle
is carried too far? Will not good students become discouraged, and
either drop out of college altogether, thus practically ruining their prom-
ising careers,"or else will they not be deflected to other schools, either at
the beginning of their courses by tales emanating from our university, of
hardships unnecessarily severe, or after their second year by a real ex-
perience with those hardships? We believe that there is quite a strong
sentiment among the undergraduate's, toward a change to some other
school after two years here, thus giving to another college to build upon,
the excellent foundation received here, and reflecting upon this other
college in after years a credit which should be ours. We know we are
treating a delicate subject, but we hope that this article will be taken
as it is meant, not as advice, but as an expression of the thoughts and
queries 'of the student body concerning this matter.

who fails to investigate claims to surpassing merit made by any apparatus
entering into his work, constantly runs the risk of remaining ignorant of
something he would gladly know. The WEBSTER SYSTEM OF
STEAM CIRCULATION lays claim to an efficiency and economy which, if
vindicated, constitute that system a class by itself. If the steam heating
of a large and important building is a problem you must shortly solve, we

THE INSPECTION AND CONTROL OF ASPHALT
PAVING MIXTURES
By L. Kirschbraun, '04, Asphalt Laboratory, Board of Local Im-
provements, Chicago, III.
During the last thirty years in which sheet asphalt pavements have
been extensively laid in this country, it is estimated that over 50,000,000
yards have been laid at a cost to American Municipalities of approxi-
mately $125,000,000. During this period there has probably been no form
of public works contracting which has been enshrouded in as much mys-
ticism and concerning which public officials knew so little and fought so
many bitter battles. Millions of dollars were expended without the


least knowledge of whether tax payers would receive full value therefor,
and with slight exception it has been only within the last few years that
public officials have begun to awaken to the necessity of some intelligent
check and inspection of asphalt paving construction.
In the early days of the industry good and bad pavements were con-
structed. It was no uncommon occurrence for the same contractor to
lay an excellent pavement on one street and a poor one on the very
next. This was not due to any inferiority of the materials available, but
to lack of knowledge as to how they should be mixed. With the advent
of the open specification which broke the monopoly held by Trinidad As-
phalt then resulted a development of other asphalts, both natural and
artificial, until in recent years there has in some local instances been too
much competition. The market has been flooded with poorly prepared or
insufficiently tested asphalts and asphaltic mixtures, producing inferior
pavements through the effort to use such in reducing the cost. It is to
guard against conditions thus outlined and to protect itself against in-
feriority in so important a matter as pavement, that the larger munici-
palities now require a system of asphalt inspection competent to discern
between good and poor paving materials and able to insure the proper
preparation of the asphalt mixture.
Asphalt pavements as now constructed consist of three courses—
a foundation of hydraulic cement concrete on a well compacted sub-
each course varying in thickness in different localities and for different
grade, an intermediate binder course, and the top or wearing surface,
conditions of traffic. It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the
general mechanical processes involved in the preparation of these courses.
Engineers do not yet realize sufficiently the importance of a rigid
and dense base for asphalt pavement. It has been the experience of the
writer that fully 50% of the failures of asphalt on heavy traffic streets
result from an insufficiency of the base, either in the matter of rigidity
or in permitting the destructive action of water on the under side of the
asphalt covering. Asphalt is the most exacting pavement in foundation
requirements, and it is as rational to build a sky scraper on a weak foun-
dation as to lay an asphalt pavement on an insufficient base. Even rigidity
in the base is insufficient where the character of the subsoil is such as to
subject the concrete base to continued moisture, and it is only by a proper
system of sub-drainage comiected to sewer inlets, that a pavement can
be insured from this destructive element. It is, however, the province
of the Engineer to provide this basic element, and for the purposes of
this discussion, it may be assumed that suitable base has been provided
for.
The essential requirement of an inspection system in a large city
is a laboratory where chemical and physical tests can be conducted upon


the various materials used, and upon the mixtures produced each day.
This should be in charge of an asphalt specialist and with him should
be provided trained inspectors for each plant whose duties will be made
evident from the discussion following.
To produce a durable pavement it is necessary first,—that the ma-
terial entering its composition be of good quality; second,—that proper
skill in proportioning and handling such material be employed. The
first requisite brings us to the discussion of the chemical and physical
characteristics of materials of the desired quality.
The asphalt is the most important of these materials. As the ce-
menting element, the life of the pavement is limited by the life and
properties of the asphalt which binds its particles together. The differ-
entiation of good from inferior asphalt has been the source of much
controversy, but with the strides which have in recent years been made
in technology of the asphalt industry, it is possible for one experienced
in the testing and in touch with the practical results obtained with suc-
cessful asphalts, to make such differentiation with sufficient certainty.
Asphalts in use at present are of great variety and the kinds met with
in any particular locality depend upon conditions of transportation, spec-
ifications and other local factors. For the purpose of treatment in this
discussion paving bitumens may be classified into three groups according
to nature and origin:
I. Natural asphalts occurring as such in nature and refined merely
by removal of water, light oils and grosser mineral impurities.
II. Combinations in which hard natural asphalts, containing less
than 60% of their bitumens soluble in standard naptha, are refined or
must be used with the addition of predominating amounts of asphaltic
oils or residues incorporated by blowing and agitation.
III. Solid residues produced by the distillation or oxidation of
petroleums.
Asphalts of the first class, which are at present of commercial im-
portance,—as examples Trinidad &amp; Bermudez,—have demonstrated by long
use their fitness for paving purposes. The nature of their bitumens is
uniform, their chemical and physical characteristics are well recognized,
and their proper method of handling well established through successful
use.
Asphalts of the second class have only in recent years become of
commercial importance through the development of the asphaltic oils.
While as a rule they have not been used sufficiently long under known
conditions to have demonstrated long durability, nevertheless for the
period in which they have been used, they have proven satisfactory when
properly handled, and give every indication of ultimate satisfaction. On
account of their nature and manner of combination, they require close


scrutiny, and in using, call for considerable skill on the part of the
plant foreman. Their use should be regulated according to condition
of inspection, traffic, and the skill and reliability of the parties pro-
ducing and using them.
Bitumens of the third division are from their present manner of
production and marketing uncertain for general use. Some are good
and some are bad. Many result as a by-product in the refining of crude
oils and are produced under such severe conditions as to become seriously
injured. California oil residues when carefully and specially prepared
for the purpose are excellent paving materials. The commercial article
however varies greatly in quality, consistency and in the conditions of
preparation, and their use should be attended by the closest scrutiny.
No doubt time will come when with more careful and uniform methods
of preparation, these California residues will be worthy of the recog-
nition, to which when so prepared they are entitled. Semi-asphaltk
(Texas), and paraffine oil residues as now prepared should not be used
as the principal part of an asphalt cement
The differentiation of good from poor asphalt is to a great extent
a matter of judgment requiring the interpretation of analytical data by
one experienced both in the laboratory testing and in the practical usage
of the various paving bitumens. The physical appearance of a good
mixture made up of a given asphalt and its behavior in the various stages
of producing and laying the pavement afford to the experienced operator
valuable indication as to the quality of the asphalt. There are however
a few well defined characteristics which good asphalts possess. These
may be roughly stated as follows:
(a) They do not contain more than 3% of their bitumens insoluble
in cold carbon tetrachloride.
(fr) Their bitumens do not yield on ignition more than 18% of
fixed carbon.
(c) Their bitumens consist of sixty per cent of malthenes, i. e.,
material soluble in standard petroleum ether. When less than this amount
of malthenes is present the asphalt should never be used without an
asphaltic flux.
(d) When fluxed into an asphalt cement of the consistency used,
it should not lose over 5% of material on heating for seven hours at
325 degrees F., nor should its consistency decrease by more than 60%
of the original consistency.
(«) The penetration when fluxed into an asphalt cement should
not be less than 10, at 32 F., nor more than 350 points at 115 degrees F.,
when tested according to a definite standard.


if) When combined with the flux as an asphalt cement, it should
not contain more than 3% of paraffine scale.
When interpreting the data obtained in test "d" it is necessary to
take into consideration the relationship between the loss of consistency
and the amount of material volatilized. When both factors are com-
paratively large, the loss of consistency is due greatly to volatilization,
but when the amount volatilized is small, a large loss of consistency
indicates oxidation or change of molecular structure. A satisfactory
asphalt cement will also exhibit in its finished mixture, malleability,
ductility, body and life, qualities for which no satisfactory tests have as
yet been devised, but which to an asphalt expert are definite and well
recognized characteristics.
Fluxes now in general use are the residues of paraffine, semi-as-
phaltic and California asphaltic petroleums. They are as a rule well pre-
pared, and ordinarily they can be easily differentiated by their densities.
A good quality of flux must be sufficiently stable as not to lose more
than 5% of material by volatilization when heated at 325 degrees P.,
and it should be so free of light oils as not to flash below 350 degrees F.
It should show no indications of rapid hardening or pitching when ex-
posed to 400 degrees F. for a period of 7 hours.
The filler commonly used is ground limestone, though various
other inorganic powders have been used at times. For work exposed to
trying conditions, Portland cement has been demonstrated to be of super-
ior efficiency. The quality demanded of filler is that of extreme fineness,
and fillers are ordinarily required to be so finely divided that 75% shall
pass a 200 mesh per linear inch sieve. There is a great range of fine-
ness however, even in material passing a 200 mesh sieve. The most
valuable part of a filler is the extreme fine material which can only
be determined by elutriation methods. Such filler as is now sometimes
prepared by blowing previously ground limestone in order to separate
and collect the finer particles, is immeasurably superior to that prepared
by grinding only.
The desirable properties of the stone used in the binder course are
that it should be clean, well graded, and so hard as not to crush under
the roller. The sand should likewse be clean and well graded as will
be discussed later and the particles should be hard and not too round.
The relative hardness of various sands has not been sufficiently investi-
gated as yet and is a matter of more importance than is commonly sup-
posed.
Having thus outlined the requirements of good materials, it is
essential that they be mixed properly in order to secure good results.
Undoubtedly there have been more failures on account of improper


mixing and handling of good materials than to the use of inferior ones.
To secure this result depends not only on laboratory inspection, but
also upon trained inspectors at the asphalt plant when the mixtures are
prepared and at the street where the material is being laid.
Upon the establishment of an asphalt plant inspection bureau for
the city of Chicago by Mr. Andrew Rosewater, C.E., Member American
Society of Civil Engineers, general instructions were issued to plant in-
spectors which may be properly given here (Sheet A).
In addition to these general instructions the point to be watched
in preparing the mixtures may be set forth briefly as follows:
In the preparation of the asphaltic cement it is essential that the
refined asphalt and flux be weighed into the kettles in such proportion
as to produce the desired consistency. The temperature of the kettles
must be regulated by the inspector within the limits which the asphalt
cement in question can properly sustain. In combining, the flux and
asphalt should be sufficiently agitated to produce thorough solution and
with asphalts containing much mineral matter, to avoid settling out of
such, with consequent lack of homogeneity in the cement and resulting
mixtures.
The consistency of the asphalt cement is varied to produce a hard
or soft pavement or to meet the requirements of a fine or coarse mineral
aggregate. It is desirable, other conditions being the same, that for
any piece of work the consistency be uniform to a standard which ex-
perience with each asphalt has demonstrated to be satisfactory. Consis-
tency is determined by the penetration machine, which operates by meas-
uring in tenths of a millimeter, the depth of penetration into a sample
of the cement at 77 degrees F. of a No. 2 needle under a weight of
100 grams for 5 seconds. Where there are facilities for testing at the
plants it is the duty of the inspector to test each kettle before use.
When there are no such facilities an experienced inspector can determine
an approximate consistency by chewing a sample of the cement. In any
case samples of each kettle are sent in daily to the laboratory for check-
ing and close control and record are kept of them.
Two kinds of binder are in use at present in the paving industry,
an open, and a closed binder or asphaltic concrete. The open binder is
made of well graded stone I'A" to J4" limiting sizes, coated with asphalt
cement. Asphaltic concrete, as the term implies, differs from the open
binder in having the void of the stone filled with an asphaltic mortar of
sand and fine screenings, making a dense and compact medium. This
is much superior to the open binder in its ability to support the sur-
face rigidly and to prevent crushing of the top into the interstices of the
binder under heavy traffic.

GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS TO INSPECTORS AT
ASPHALT PLANTS.
Inspectors at Asphalt Plants are hereby instructed to take
note daily of the materials used in the proportioning of paving
mixtures, both as to their physical nature and the quantities,
by measurements and weight.
It is desirable for the preparation and maintenance of proper
records in connection with work, under contract with the City,
to note the name and brand of each kind of material used, and
in compounding mixtures to see them measured and weighed and
observe, whatever proportions are used in the various mixtures,
whether a uniformity is maintained, and if no uniformity or sys-
tem is observed, to embrace such facts in the reports.
Contractors are expected to afford all necessary conveniences
for such inspections. If obstacles are placed in the way of se-
curing desired information or facilities are denied by any con-
tractor, the inspector must note same in his daily report with
the alleged reasons.
Samples of asphaltic cement used shall be sent daily to the
laboratory for testing purposes, also the street surface mixtures.
Separate samples of other materials called for by the chemist
shall be taken for examination and test to the laboratory. Any-
thing relating to materials received at the plant, or to operations
in their mixture and the handling, shall be noted on the daily
reports sent to the laboratory.

Board of Local Improvements, Director.
President.


The main cause of trouble with open binder is over heating,—not
necessarily on account of injury to the cement but because of the fact
that the coating of cement will run off of hot stone to such an extent
that at the end of a long haul the top three-quarters of a load will be
so devoid of cement as to be insufficiently bonded when laid, while the
material in the bottom of the wagon contains an excess of "juice," mak-
ing it difficult to rake and forming when rolled "a grease spot" This
in the course of years is absorbed into the top, softening it and resulting
in displacement or grinding out. The only test of a good open binder
is, that it should appear on close inspection with the eye to be uni-
formly and well coated, and when rolled and cold should sustain the
traffic incidental to laying the top without breaking up. With closed
binder, there is not so much danger of separation of the cement, but
the point most generally overlooked is in getting a uniform amount of
fine material mixed with the stone, and this can be accomplished only
by receiving the stone and sand in separate bins and mixing them in
uniform proportions. This material when laid and compacted should,
on breaking, appear solid and well filled, but not over filled.
The proper proportioning of the materials entering into the wear-
ing surface presents the most difficulty for the reason that the amount
of asphalt cement, filler, and sand vary and are interdependent upon each
other according to the characteristics of each material. Failure to rec-
ognize this fact and work by rule of thumb has produced many unneces-
sary failures. Density, toughness and elasticity, are the characteristics
to be sought for in preparing a durable mixture and wide latitude is
usually allowed the contractor in producing this result. Unfortunately
such latitude often leads the contractor to economizing on such mater-
ials as increase the cost, so that it is much more satisfactory to specify
within reasonable limits, certain requirements of bitumen and aggregate
as have been shown by actual practice to produce successful results.
These requirements as provided in the new specifications prepared for
the City of Chicago are as follows:
Bitumen soluble in cold carbon bi-sulphide 10.5—13 %
Portland cement and Mineral Dust passing a 200
mesh sieve 12.0—18 %
Sand passing an 80 mesh sieve 18.0—36.0%
Sand passing a 40 mesh sieve 30.0—50.0%
Sand passing a 10 mesh sieve 8.0—20.0%
The sieves being used in the order named.
A mixture prepared without discretion to come within these limits
might still be unsatisfactory. For example, should the mineral aggre-


gate grade according to the maximum coarseness allowable, a bitumen
content of 13% would be entirely too much, likewise an extremely fine
aggregate should have more than the minimum percentage of bitumen
to produce a satisfactory mixture. Given a sand of a definite grading
and a specified amount of filler to be incorporated, the amount of asphalt
cement to be used can be regulated by the appearance of a stain pro-
duced by compressing a portion of the hot mixture between a sheet of
light manilla paper. If the mixture is rich, the excessive amount of
asphalt cement will stain the paper heavily,—if dry, the stain will be
light In making this test it is necessary to consider the temperature of
the mixture tested and the manner in which the pressure is applied. A
very hot sample and excessive pressure will indicate a degree of satura-
tion not at all true, so that it is necessary to apply such test with dis-
cretion.
It is the duty of the inspectors at the plant to watch the surface
mixture as produced, very carefully and to make such rough tests as
described above to ascertain its correct proportioning. When a mixture
has once been established as satisfactory, it is their duty to see that the
established proportions are uniformly mixed. The carelessness of the
men employed in the actual mixing of the material is sometimes re-
markable. The great desire at many plants is to turn the mixture out
fast. The greater output means economy in cost of production and in
the attempt to hurry the mix, the proportions are often inaccurately
guaged and the material imperfectly mixed. The measuring and weigh-
ing devices are liable to get out of order and register inaccurately and
many a street, the mixture of which has been planned with the best of
intention, has been faulty for reasons of this nature. The inspector must
see that nothing of this sort occurs, that the mixture is actually being
produced according to approved proportions. While any error would
eventually be checked up by the laboratory, in a large city it might be
days before this were accomplished.
The temperature at which the mixture is produced is of great im-
portance and there is a tendency among most plant men to neglect this
altogether, or to heat the mixture unnecessarily in order that it may
work easier on the street. The minimum heat compatible with proper
workmanship is desirable. There is no occasion for heating above such
a temperature. A mixture may not be actually burned by an elevated
temperature, for there is every stage of injury between being first class
and the final stage of being burned, and while a mixture may show
very little evidence of heat injury, its ultimate life may nevertheless be
seriously shortened. Inspectors are required to hold their mixtures at
low workable temperatures, keeping the sand passing out of the drums


at such a heat as to ensure the desired temperature in the final mixture.
Plant inspectors report daily on forms as shown below (Sheet B).
Samples of the mixture are sent in daily to the laboratory from the
Street in a special envelope giving necessary data as shown in the form
below. The street inspection in the City of Chicago is under separate
head (Sheet C).
These samples are analyzed and filed.
From the descriptions given it is possible to locate defective mix-
tures and further, at the end of the season it is possible to make up
plats of each street showing where various mixtures and various mater-
ials have been laid. To assist in this the plant inspectors are directed
to locate in the street points where new materials or changes of mixture
have been made, so that in after years it would be possible to judge of
the causes of failure or success of any street with accurate knowledge
of materials and conditions under which it was laid. A final record is
made up and filed, giving complete data regarding the street, including
plats, nature and analysis of all materials used in its production, with
daily record of the composition of the mixture and any physical condi-
tion of base, subgrade, and traffic, affecting the life of the pavement.
In conclusion may be emphasized the absolute necessity of keeping
accurate records as described above. For scientific progress in this in-
dustry it is essential that the actual results obtained be closely observed,
so that with known conditions it is possible to benefit by good results,
to be able to reproduce them and to avoid such influences as are demon-
strated to involve error and failure. An asphalt laboratory is valuable
only for the practical results attained and not for new theories evolved
each year, unless such theories are sufficiently demonstrated by actual
results obtained under known conditions.

THE ENGINEER'S CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT
By J. C. Knowlton, A.B., LL.B., Marshall Professor of Law, Univer-
sity of Michigan.
The distinction between architect and engineer is largely aesthetical
and without legal significance. We shall use the terms interchangeably.
The engineer's professional employment, of late years, has called on
him to enter into contractual relations as variant as human ingenuity
can suggest. These relations have given rise to many serious and per-
plexing questions in jurisprudence. We shall call attention to a few only
that have arisen over the preparing of plans and specifications, in the
superintending of construction and in the arbitrating of differences be-
tween owner and builder.
As a general rule if a person renders another service on request,
the law implies a promise to make reasonable compensation for the ser-
vice rendered. This rule is not always applied in favor of an engineer
preparing for another plans or designs for buildings or other work.
This is due largely to the careless manner in which some persons solicit
employment and the too frequent indulgence of others in a desire to get
something for nothing. The entire transaction between parties may in-
volve only a few words, such as: "make me a sketch," or "put some
suggestions on paper." This is enough, if what is done is afterwards
approved and adopted, but if it is rejected there is no contract. An
architect should not spend much time on persons looking only for ideas
unless they expect to pay for them. The ideas of every professional
man and particularly of an engineer are the most valuable of his worldly
possessions, but he must not expect courts to make contracts for him or
to allow compensation for services apparently voluntary.
The engineer's property in his plans and specifications have troubled
the courts and the engineering profession for some time. When an archi-
tect prepares plans and specifications for another under contract to do
so, the plans are the property of his employer, unless there be some ex-
press reservation to the contrary in the contract of employment. Simply
marking the plans as the "property of the architect" does not change
the rule. Engineers and engineering societies have vigorously contended
to the contrary and some writers have insisted that, especially after com-
pletion of the work planned, the plans and specifications were the property


of the architect, on the theory that his contract only called for service
and not for the delivery of property. This contention is not sound.
Architects and engineers in England and this country have estab-
lished among themselves a usage or custom that the plans and specifi-
cations are the property of the architect, but the courts of both countries
have pronounced this custom unreasonable and not binding on the courts.
Lansford vs. Dielrich, 86 Ala. 250.
Gibbon vs. Pease, 92 I,. T. 433 (1905).
Piracy of designs, plans and specifications is one of the most em-
barrassing evils in the profession. Architects are invited by boards or
committees to submit for competitive examination plans for some public
building. The plans are prepared at a great expense and then all are
rejected and some favored person is asked to prepare plans and appro-
priate the acceptable and perhaps original ideas in construction developed
and submitted by others. This involves a moral wrong in that it is taking
the property of others without compensation. Against this wrong there
is no adequate protection. The copyright laws of the country do not
cover plans and specifications, and it is said that there is no intrinsic
property in an architect's designs.
Smithneyer vs. U. S. 25 C. of C. 482.
At the common law and independent of statute an author has a
property right in his literary productions and may limit and control their
use by others. His presentation of them to others under express or im-
plied restrictions does not amount to such a dedication to the public as
to make them the common property of all, notwithstanding such restricted
publication the law protects his private property right in them. It is
to be regretted that a similar common law right has not been accorded
architects and engineers in the use of their designs, plans and speci-
fications in construction. These frequently represent a vast amount of
labor, skill and knowledge and at times great inventive genius which
should be encouraged, by proper protection which the law does not give.
Various societies of architects and engineers have attempted to reg-
ulate the compensation to be received for services rendered and have
adopted a schedule of charges for preparing plans and specifications and
the superinending of construction. It is fair to say that these schedules
are of very little value before our courts and have no binding force as
between an architect and his employer unless they are made a part of
the contract. They are not evidence of the true value of services. They
are binding only on members of the society and only morally binding
on them. They can not affect others unless the contract is made clearly
with reference to them. It has been urged that these schedules are evi-


dence of the usage or custom of the profession and therefore binding
on those dealing with architects. The usage may be of force as between
architects, but a usage among architects is not a usage between an
architect and his employer, and where there is no contract express or
implied, usage or custom can not make one.
Tilley vs. County of Cook, 103 U. S. 155.
Smithneyer vs. U. S. 147 U. S. 342.
Scott vs. Meyer, 56 Mich. 554.
The law recognizes the architect's right to recover for his ser-
vices the contract price if there be an express contract and if not then
he may recover only what his services are reasonably worth and this
can not be determined by any usage or custom among architects.
Architects, too frequently perhaps, undertake to prepare plans and
specifications on an understanding that they are to receive nothing for
their pains unless a responsible contractor is found who will construct
the proposed work at a cost not exceeding a specified sum. This is a
conditional proposal and unless the condition is complied with the archi-
tect can recover nothing. Generaly speaking this is not a commendable
form of undertaking for any professional man. It resembles the law-
yer's contingent fee and the doctor's "no cure, no pay." No man has
proper self respect who gambles on success in his profession. Courts,
however, recognize this form of employment and enforce the contract,
not however without some misgivings. They recognize the moral im-
possibility of an architect being able to fix precisely the cost of any
building, if the cost is to be measured in any such capricious way as by
the bids of contractors.
Coombs vs. Beebe, 89 Me. 192.
A superintendent of construction is, generally speaking, the agent
of the owner, even though he be named in • the contract between the
owner and builder and in a sense a party to the contract. In the larger
works of construction it is frequently provided that he shall be the
sole interpreter of the drawings and specifications and that his decision
upon all questions relating to the same shall be final and binding upon
the owner and the contractor. There is no legal objection to this kind
of a contract if parties are willing to make it, but courts are not agreed
as to the force and effect of such a contractual stipulation, where an
architect or engineer acting under it wrongfully withholds his certificate
of work. Some courts hold that the superintendent's certificate of work
is so essential to the contractor's right of recovery that a wanton or
captious withholding of the certificate will not give the contractor a right
of recovery without it. This is a severe rule. Other courts have heM
that the contractor may recover without the superintendent's certificate


if it be withheld without reasonable cause, and some states have by legis-
lation provided that the superintendent's certificate can not, by contract
of parties, be made conclusive as to the contractor's right of recovery.

Edwards vs. Hartshorn (Kan.), 82 Pac. 520.
Huber vs. St. Joseph Hospital (Ida.), 83 Pac. 738.
The better rule seems to be that the superintendent's certificate may
be dispensed with when his conduct in withholding it shows bad faith.
It must be admitted that an architect or engineer occupies a posi-
tion of great professional delicacy when he fills the place of superinten-
dent of construction and is called upon to interpret his own drawings
and specifications, frequently ambiguous and doubtful in meaning, while
at the same time he is in the employ and under the pay of one of the
contracting parties. I know of no relation calling for a higher degree
of good faith.
The position is anomalous but it becomes more so when the super-
intendent is also personally interested as part owner of the work under
construction or as stockholder of a corporation that is one of the con-
tracting parties. This personal interest, if known to the contracting
parties, does' not disqualify his acting as superintendent and as umpire
of differences between the owner and the builder or contractor. In such
capacity he is required to exercise almost judicial discretion and, in a
sense, to sit as a judge in his own cause.
To the legal profession this condition is abhorrent but courts of
law allow and respect contracts of this character. Two checks however
are insisted upon. First. The personal interest of the superintendent
of construction in the business involved must be fully known to the
contracting parties at the time the contract is made. Any secret interest,
direct or indirect, he may have in the undertaking will disqualify him
from acting for the parties and may deprive him of compensation for
services rendered. Upon this point the courts are exceedingly severe
and cautious to protect the rights of both the owner and the builder.
Second. The superintendent must not permit his personal interest
in any part of the contract to influence or dictate his conduct in direct-
ing the work. If he does and the courts observe it, he will be turned
out of court without a remedy.
Lingenfelder vs. Wamright, 103 Mo. 578.
A larger question may come before you, and it is this: How far
ought you, in fairness to yourself, accept the position of superintendent
of construction and arbitrator of differences in a matter in which yo«
are personally interested. Your professional standing will be improved


by avoiding such a questionable position. It is not enough that the courts
permit it.
Whatever the contract of an engineer, there is over and above it
and controlling it an implied undertaking more important than the
express words of the contract. He undertakes, First, that he possesses
the requisite skill and knowledge of his profession. Second, that he will
use that skill and knowledge according to his best judgment. Third, that
he will perform his duties in the utmost good faith to all parties inter-
ested. Failing in any one of these particulars he is liable before the law.
No better statement of the responsibilities of an engineer under
his contract of employment is found than the words of Peters, C. J., in
Coombs vs. Beebe: (supra).
"The responsibility resting on an architect is essentially the same
as that which rests upon the lawyer to his client, or upon the physician
to his patient, or which rests upon any one to another where such per-
son pretends to possess some skill and ability in some special employ-
ment, and offers his services to the public on account of his fitness to
act in the line of business for which he may be employed. The under-
taking of an architect implies that he possesses skill and ability, includ-
ing taste sufficient to enable him to perform the required services at least
ordinarily and reasonably well and that he will exercise and apply in the
given case his skill and ability, his judgment and taste, reasonably and
without neglect. But the undertaking does not imply or warrant a satis-
factory result. It will be enough that any failure shall not be the fault
of the architect. There is no implied promise that miscalculations may
not occur. An error of judgment is not necessarily evidence of a want
of skill or care, for mistakes and miscalculations arc incident to all
the business of life."

HIGH SPEED TOOL STEEL
By John W. Langley.
Since 1900 a new kind of steel has come into general use for cut-
ting and shaping metals, and this steel makes tools having unique prop-
erties which enable them to perform work at a much higher rate than
tools made of ordinary steel, and which has given to them the title of
"High Speed Tools," or "High Speed Steel."
As an illustration of what this title implies it will be sufficient to
say that an ordinary lathe tool made from the customary carbon steel of
commerce will, when adjusted to the standard cut, and when working on
soft cast iron or mild steel or wrought iron, not.endure a speed of over
fifteen feet per minute without being rapidly ground away and having
its cutting edge destroyed, while on the other hand a high speed tool
may be driven up to as much as ninety feet per minute, and then will
probably have its cutting edge so highly heated by the friction of the
work that it will appear of a dull red heat as seen by diffused daylight.
In this instance the rate of work has been increased six times, with a
corresponding saving in the time and wages of the lathe man.
In the above statement there are two expressions which may need
explanation. These are "the standard cut" and the "speed." Mr. Fred-
erick W. Taylor contributed to the Society of Mechanical Engineers last
year a most valuable paper on the subject of cutting tools, and of shop
management therewith. In this article he gives the result of some twenty
years' study of the best shape and best methods of using metal cutting
tools, and a considerable part of this research was to determine a stand-
ard set of conditions under which a stool should be tested.
After trying many different conditions he developed what he calls
the standard cut, and gives reasons for the same, the principal ones
resting on the fact that the duty of the tool must be sufficiently heavy
to bring fairly heavy strains to bear on it. He selects soft cast iron or
mild structural steel as the body to be operated on, and it must not be
too small in diameter, say, not under four inches, and preferably much
over that size. Then the tool to be tested is mounted on the slide rest,
and so adjusted that it will turn off a chip 3/16 by 1/16 of an inch
measured on the object which is being turned, that is, the tool must re-
duce the radius of the work 3/16 of an inch while the feed is moving


it along for each revolution 1/16 of an inch. The life of the tool is de-
termined for that particular test when the radial depth of the cut shows
any sensible reduction visible to the naked eye when using a small metal
gauge, this reduction, as the writer has observed it, being about 1/50 of
an inch. Thus it will be seen that when the above conditions are se-
sured the only variable will be the rate of revolution which gives the
speed. The "speed" is, therefore, the number of feet of the circum-
ference of the body which is being cut which pass the edge of the tool
per minute.
The first explanation which would naturally be put forth for the
superior endurance of the high speed tool is that it must be excessively
hard, but such a condition is not a fact, and one's astonishment
is greatly increased when it is found that the new tool is actually
softer than one which has been made from ordinary or carbon steel,
for a file will easily scratch, and in some cases abrade the former, while,
as is well known, a carbon tool when tempered and drawn to a straw
color should be too hard to be more than superficially scratched by a
file.
To what then is the superiority of the new steel due? The answer
is, because it does not lose its initial hardness till it reaches a tempera-
ture bordering on a heat where black is just merging into red, or has
actually attained the latter color. This property may be denoted as
"red-hardness" to distinguish it from ordinary hardness of steel tools.
A carbon steel tool is hardened, as everyone knows by heating it
to a point where a red color just begins to be invaded by yellow tints,
this is the "Recalescent point" on the heating curve, and will be very
close to 7300 Centigrade, then the steel is to be plunged into water for
sudden cooling whereupon it will acquire the condition termed "glass-
hard" or "file-hard." Carbon steel thus treated will begin to lose hard-
ness when brought up to the temperature of boiling water, and from
this on in progressively increasing degree till well before a red heat
is attained its hardness is entirely lost. This gradual loss of hardness
with concomitant gain in toughness is the result of the familiar operation
of "drawing the temper."
The reason, therefore, why ordinary steel will not make a tool
which can be driven beyond a relatively low speed is because the friction
incidental to cutting draws the temper to the softening point, while the
new steels, which belong to the class of alloy steels, do not exhibit any
marked softening till nearly a red heat is approached or actually acquired.
Ordinary tool steel consists essentially of iron and carbon with a
minimum of other but unavoidable impurities, with the exception of


19
manganese which is intentionally added. A typical example of such
steel is the following:
Silicon 1 to .2 percent.
Phosphorus 01 to .05 per cent.
Sulphur 02 to .04 per cent.
Manganese 15 to .30 per cent.
Carbon 1.00 to 1.25 per cent.
Alloy steels are those in which certain metals are intentionally
added to the iron in the crucible^ before or during melting. These sub-
stances have the property of modifying the action of carbon on iron.
A considerable number of alloy steels is known, but the only ones which
are at "present used for tool making purposes contain, in addition to
iron and carbon, the following four elements: Manganese, Tungsten.
Chromium and Molybdenum. Of these the first three must be present,
with the understanding, however, that Molybdenum and Tungsten are
interchangeable in the ratio of one part of Molybdenum for two of
Tungsten.
Sincfe Silicon, Phosphorus and Sulphur are unavoidable impurities
in all commercial steel they must be brought down to a minimum. A
typical high speed steel will contain these elements, say, in the propor-
tions given above for carbon steel, and in addition the following which
have been intentionally added to the iron:
Manganese 15 to .35 per cent.
Tungsten 5.00 to 17.00 per cent.
Chromium i.ooto 3.50 per cent.
Carbon 4 to .85 per cent.
Molybdenum may also be used and may replace the Tungsten, either
in whole or in part, in the ratio of one of Molybdenum to two of
Tungsten.
The above percentages are not rigidly fixed, and analyses of sam-
ples of high speed steel made by various manufacturers would show
considerable differences; but two of the above elements, in addition to
manganese and carbon, must be present, viz.: Chromium and either
tungsten or its equivalent in molybdenum.
To make a lathe tool from such an alloy steel as the above, the
tool must first be forged at a heat where yellow well predominates over
red, and then allowed to cool spontaneously in the air, after which it is
to be rough ground into shape, for it will be too hard to be readily worked
with a file. Now comes a unique treatment, which would entirely spoil
a piece of carbon steel. The tool must have its nose inserted into a very
hot fire. This can best be done by having a deep bed of coke over a


blast of air, and the tool so held that only its nose is in the stream
of heated flame and products of combustion rising from the coke. The
end of the tool is to be heated to incipient melting or, as the patentees
of this treatment (Taylor and White) say, "till its edge crumbles when
touched with a rod." The tool is promptly withdrawn from the fire and
cooled in a blast of air, or thrown on the floor to cool spontaneously,
but in this case the result is not quite so good as when the air blast
is used. In no case must it be put into water while hot. This finishes
the heat treatment.
When cold the tool must be groiuid into shape in the usual man-
ner. It will be found to have acquired the property of "ned-hardness"
in a high degree, but while all parts of it will be tolerably hard, but not
"file-hard" still, it is ony the nose which will have red-hardness. More-
over the tool throughout all its parts will be tolerably brittle, not quite
so much so as an ordinary file, but greatly more than a lathe tool made
from ordinary steel; for instance, a high speed tool having a shank two
inches by one inch may be broken if screwed up too tightly in the tool
post.
It will be interesting to compare the properties and treatment of
a high speed tool with an ordinary one made from carbon steel.
The carbon steel tool should not be heated for hardening purposes
much above the recalescent point, that is, to a yellowish red, or a little
above 7300 C, and then cooled as quickly as possible, after which its
temper may be drawn to any desired degree by a very moderate heating.
If this carbon steel tool is heated much above the proper temperature for
hardening, as given above, it deteriorates, while if brought up to incipient
melting it will be ruined, or in shop language "burnt." The high speed
tool heated to 730° C. or a little higher would not have the property of
red-hardness, it would be relatively soft and would be quite inferior to
the carbon steel one. A high speed tool heated to redness or above
and plunged into water would probably fly in pieces, and would in any
case almost certainly crack. The high speed tool acquires its hardness
and has its temper drawn to the right degree simultaneously by air cool-
ing from a very high temperature, although a method of still further
improving it has been invented by first raising it to the temperature of
incipient melting, and then cooling it in a bath of red hot melted lead,
from which it is withdrawn for final air cooling.
There have been several theories offered to account for the peculiar
treatment demanded by high speed steel and the wonderful endurance
which it acquires thereby. In the case of carbon steel it is now well
known that the carbon passes from the hardening into the softening
state in its combination with iron at the recalescent point, with the
concomitant production of several carbides of iron which can be revealed


microscopically, and to which special names have been given, such as
Austenite, cementite, etc.
It seems probable that double carbides of iron and chromium are
formed in high speed steel at the very high temperature to which it
must be raised for hardening, and that tungsten or molybdenum act as
delayers of the reverse change back to softening carbon, and that this
inhibiting effect does not become impaired till a red heat is attained,
hence the very high duty of this steel.
Air, on self hardening steels, first started with Mushet about 1850.
Mushet steel has been long known and used under that name. It con-
sisted essentially of iron with tungsten from 3. to 10. with manganese
1.5 or over, and carbon 1.5 to 2. This steel could only be heated to a
moderate yellow color, or at least this was the universal practice, and
then cooled in the air. Tools made from it were not notable for ability
to stand speeds above those for carbon steel, and they were used only for
roughing cuts, since they would not hold a fine edge.
About 1892-95 chromium commenced to be added to Mushet steel,
but not with much improvement, but between 1895 and 1900 the man-
ganese was reduced and the chromium increased with a further improve-
ment in the alloy, but still no distinctively high speed properties were
developed till the process invented and patented by Taylor and White
in 1900 for the heat treatment of this steel, which is that which has been
described above, viz.: heating the tools to a point where ordinary steel
would be ruined, and a temperature greatly in excess of the practice for
self hardening steels as used prior to 1900, was made public, and illus-
trated in the American exhibit at the Paris exposition of 1900.


THE RESULTS OF SOME EXPERIMENTS UPON THE
RESISTANCE OF SHIPS
By H. C. Sadler, Sc.D., Professor of Naval Architecture.
In connection with the regular tank work, some experiments have
been carried out recently to determine the effect of distribution of dis-
placement upon the resistance of different forms.
^For a given set of dimensions, length, breadth, and draught, a large
number of forms may be used, for a given displacement. In order to
determine the effect of change of distribution of form upon the resistance
for all types of ships, a large number of experiments will be necessary.
The present results therefore are those which have been obtained from
one particular type, and similar experiments are now under way for
some other types.
The curves shown in Fig. I marked ''Sectional Areas" represent in
general the variations of form that is possible with any given type. At
any point the ordinate to the curves represents the sectional area of
the vessel, up to the waterline, at that point. The area of the whole
curve, therefore, represents the displacement of the vessel.
In this series of experiments, the dimensions and displacement were
kept the same throughout, the only difference in the various models being
one of longitudinal distribution of displacement.
The curves marked iB, iS and 3B, 3S represent the two extreme
types, whose general characteristics are, first, a vessel with a long par-
allel middle body accompanied by fine ends, and second, a vessel with
no middle body and hence rather fuller ends when compared with the
previous one.
The models, as will be seen from the accompanying table, are those
of an average ocean "intermediate" type, and were all tested at three
different draughts, and at various speeds.

Five models were made as follows:
1 B 1 S. Fine bow, fine stern.
1 B 3 S. Fine bow, full stern.
3 B 1 S. Full bow, fine stern.
3 B 3 S. Full bow, full stern,
and also one model representing an average form.
The results of the experiments are shown in Fig. 1 for the medium
draught; the general characteristics are, however, the same for all
draughts*
The curves represent residuary or wave making resistance, which
is obtained by subtracting the surface friction from the total resist-
ance. They are also plotted in terms of pounds per ton of displacement,
and therefore apply to any vessel of this form irrespective of size. The
speed scale, instead of being actual speed in knots, is plotted in terms
of speed in knots divided by the square root of the length in feet. This
method also eliminates actual sire because of the relation between "cor-
responding speeds," and length. (By the term corresponding speeds is
meant, speeds which vary as the square root of the lengths of vessels of
the same form but different linear dimensions.)
The following are some of the general conclusions that may be
drawn from an analysis of the above results:
First, the form with the fine bow (1 B) and flat middle body has
much less resistance within the practical range of speeds for this type
of vessel, than that with the fuller bow (3B) and somewhat easier form
to midships. This difference in residuary resistance amounts to from
75 to 100 per cent, and in total resistance of the model from 20 to 25
per cent, between the best and the worst forms. (In the case of a
500-foot vessel of this type this would amount to about 2000 I. H. P.)
Second, the form with the fine fore body and fuller but easier after
body, appears to be more easily driven than one where both ends are fine.
Third, the resistance of the forms with the fine ends and flat middle
body have a more wavy character than those where the ends are fuller
and the form more gradual. From observation of the waves made by
the different forms, this appears to be due to the more pronounced
transverse wave system formed by the somewhat abrupt change of form
in the models with the flat middle body.
The second set of curves, Fig. 2, represent the results of some
experiments upon a somewhat fuller form than the previous one. The
general characteristics of the forms are shown in the curves of sec-
tional areas marked 1, 2, 3 and 4.
* The complete set have been published in a paper by the author in
Vol. 15, Trans. Soc. Nav. Arch, and Marine Engrs.


Forms 4 and 2 are the fullest and very nearly the same displace-
ment, the principal difference being that 4 has slightly finer ends for
about ten per cent of the length from each end, and a rather longer
middle body. The effect of this upon the resistance may be seen by
comparing the curves 4 and 2. The after body of form 4 was modified
so as to be the same as 2, except that the extreme end was kept the
same as before. The result of this is seen by comparing the resistance
curve 4 and 2 with that for form 4, and shows a difference of about 6
per cent by reducing the somewhat abrupt form of stern in form 4.
In order to find the effect of cutting away the bow, but keeping
the general shape of section the same, the form 2 was modified to form 3.
The effect of this is seen by comparing the resistance curves of 2 and 3,
and shows a reduction of about 7 per cent in the wave making resist-
ance at about the maximum economical speed of this type. If however
the forward end and after ends for about 7.5 per cent of the length
are made finer to conform with type 4, the comparison of curve 3 with
4 and 2 shows a further reduction of about 7 per cent in the wave mak-
ing resistance.
If the extreme ends are kept the same for about 5 per cent of the
length and the form cut away at each end to conform with the curve
of sectional areas marked I, the effect upon the wave making resistance
is shown by the curve I: the difference between this and the curve for
4 and 2 is nearly 8 per cent.


THE PRESENT STATUS OF CONCRETE CONSTRUC-
TION
By H. C. Hutchins, '03.
Concrete construction has had a wonderful growth in the last
ten years. While concrete has been used in retaining walls and other
massive construction in place of masonry for many years, it has not
competed with wood or steel construction until quite recently. The re-
duction in cost of producing cement and the machinery for mixing con-
crete have been the principal factors in cheapening concrete construction.
It was thought for many years that reinforced concrete was not destined
to succeed, and architects and builders were slow to take it up. France
was the first to carry the work forward but today the United States is
undoubtedly as great a user of concrete as any other nation. The
records of the Patent Office are interesting, showing the growth of
concrete construction. Five years ago there was only an occasional
patent issued for some concrete device, while now there are at least three
patents issued a week.
The efforts of the leading men in concrete work have been directed
recently toward the cheapening of the forms for holding the concrete
while it hardens. Various metal forms are now in use, special machines
being built for making sidewalks at the rate of not less than 600 feet
a day. A machine for making the curb and gutter for a street, and
special forms for building pipes from two inches diameter up to any
size required are among the latest successful inventions. These machines
are made on the principle of having the form travel along, the concrete
being fed into the machine at the front end and the sidewalk, pipe or
curb being left in place as the machine progresses.
In the field of building construction every form of design now
executed in steel or wood can also be designed in concrete and in many
cases greatly to the advantage of the structure. A recent use of con-
crete is for chemical works, the concrete being used to replace lead
lined chambers that were required to resist the action of acids and
gases. While concrete will not resist the action of all chemical com-
pounds, its range of usefulness is much greater than wood or steel.
For example concrete has recently been used for bleach chambers, doing
away with the expensive wood and lead construction which has been


CORE TEST DRILLING ON NEW LOCK SITE- -"SOO*
By WimER M. Rich, Jun. Am. Soc. C.E.
In connection with the design of a lock at Sault Ste. Marie, Mich.,
the United States has recently carried on some core drilling to test the
foundations. This work was done with the Davis Calyx Shot Drill
and the general method pursued is briefly outlined in this article.
In developing the vast mineral and coal resources of the earth,
the most satisfactory method was found to be the core drill method,
by which a solid core was obtained from the rock, and could be brought
to the surface and examined. For this purpose the Diamond drill was
invented, using black diamonds for cutting rock of varying hardness.
These diamonds were imbedded in a hollow soft steel bit, half of
them being set on the outer edge of the bit, and the other half set on
the inner edge, thereby cutting the clearance necessary for the free
turning and removal of the bit and core barrel. This is a very good
method of core drilling, and in fact the only one that will give satis-
factory results in the harder rocks, but it is a very expensive drill to
run, and for the softer rocks it was found to be more economical to use
the so-called Rotary shot drill. Chilled steel shot are used for this
work, and they are made to travel under a hollow soft steel bit which
rotates and exerts a pressure on the shot at the same time, thereby
causing them to cut away the rock. The bit is usually from three to ten
inches long and is screwed into the core barrel—a hollow cylinder of
the same diameter as the bit, and on this particular job, from 2 to 4?4
feet long.
The core-barrel was in turn screwed on to the drill rods, which
were much smaller in diameter and in lengths of 2, 5 and 10 feet. Water
was fed into the drill rods by means of a water swivel and lifter, fas-
tened to the top of the driving rod, to which was attached the drill
rods. By means of a stop cock in the swivel, the shot was
fed into the drill from the top and was carried down to the
bit by the water. On the inside of the bit were two grooves placed
diametrically opposite each other to allow the shot to run down under
the bit easily. One side of the bit was cut away in a V-shaped manner
to allow the shot to work freely under the bit. Besides the shot bit
the outfit consists of a Davis cutter for cutting ordinary earth and sand,

a clay bit, and a chopping bit. The power, provided by a small vertical
engine, is transmitted by means of a belt to the bevel-gears for rotating
the drill rods.
The shot drill is very well adapted for general work, but there are
many difficulties encountered by shot drillers—the chief ones are as
follows:
i. The regulation of the amount of shot necessary to cut the rock
of varying hardness.
2. The regulation of the amount of water necessary to remove the
washings without disturbing the shot.
3. The pressure to be exerted upon the shot to obtain the best
results.
4. The removal of core, as a small piece left in the hole is liable
to turn over in the bit and cause trouble and a waste of time.
The underlying rock at the "Soo" is red Potsdam sandstone and
at the new lock site the ledge is from nine to thirty-five feet below the
surface of the ground.
The ledge is not at all regular, and on account of the strata dipping
slightly toward the east, the surface has a sort of scalloped formation.
Immediately above the rock ledge there is, in many places, a layer of
hard-pan, from four to six feet deep, composed of clay, sand, pebbles
and occasional large boulders. The overburden is largely made land,
consisting of broken sandstone, clay, and sand, which makes a very diffi-
cult and unsatisfactory material to drill through.
In order to sink the casing, a shallow hole was first dug and then
a solid steel shaft 5" in diameter was driven into the earth by means
of a 1500-pound pile driver hammer. This shaft was driven into the
ground as far as possible, sometimes to the rock ledge itself, and then
was removed by means of jacks. The casing was then inserted in the
hole made by the shaft and driven down as far as was possible without
injuring the bottom of it. After this operation was completed the pile
driver was removed and the drill set in position. By alternately drill-
ing, washing out, and driving the casing, it was finally gotten down to
the rock ledge and everything was in readiness for the shot drill to
begin operations.
For drilling in the earth, while sinking the casing, the Davis cutter
was used with a steady stream of water flowing down the hollow drill
rods and washing the loosened material to the top of the casing. The
Davis cutter is a hollow cylinder of soft steel and has a number of sharp
teeth cut into the bottom for the purpose of loosening the earth, which
is carried away by the stream of water.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Once the casing rests evenly on the rock ledge, the shot drilling
may procede without any very serious difficulties.
The amount of core that could be drilled and lifted in one lift,
depended upon the nature of the rock and the ease with which the drill
was cutting. The length of core of one single lift varied from lA inch
to 52 inches, the limit as to length depending only upon the length of core
barrel and the free working of the shot under the bit. The pieces of
core varied in size, from discs the thickness of paper, to cylinders 18
inches in length. The rock formation was all of the same general
kind, although it varied considerably in hardness and color. Some of
it was very soft, so soft in fact, that it was almost a clay and would
crumble in the hand. This was of the darker shade of red, while the
harder rock was light in color, sometimes almost a gray. In removing
and examining the core it was found that there was considerable loss
of core to be accounted for. Some of this loss was caused by the pieces
grinding on one another' and by shale seams washed away in drilling,
but in some cases there may have been small voids in the rock itself.
This was especially noticeable in drilling through a hard formation and
striking a soft layer beneath, as invariably there was a loss of core to
be accounted for directly under the hard rock. In a few instances the
spaces between the layers were found to be filled with clay, or a very
fine gravel. The stratification was in general horizontal, with an occas-
ional vertical or diagonal seam, the latter usually occurring in the harder
rock. A diagram and description of the core was made from day to day.
and the core was stored for future reference, on shelves in a warehouse,
the pieces being arranged in the order in which they came from the hole.
After each lift a sounding was taken in the hole, and the time,
depth, etc., was recorded by the inspector as follows:
Hole No.

1. Time of lift
Reason for lifting
2. Depth
3. Former

4. Core
Length, No. of pieces and brief description

5. Time of start


The work was carried on each day in three shifts each eight hours
long. Two men were required for each shift;—the drillman and his
assistant, who also acted as fireman. The time spent in actual drilling
varied considerably, depending upon the time required in making a lift,
and on unavoidable delays.
The time required for lifting was fairly constant, although neces-
sarily increasing somewhat with the increase of depth of hole. Numerous
unavoidable delays occurred, such as the breaking of the pump, steam
fittings, or the wedging of the core-barrel in the hole. The latter delay
was the most serious one and caused considerable loss of time when
it occurred, the hole filling up with dirt, washings and sand, with insuffi-
cient water pressure to wash it clear, or by pieces of rock being dis-
lodged from the side of the hole and falling down between the core-
barrel and the rock. When the core-barrel became too tightly wedged
to be lifted out by means of jacks, it was necessary to remove the rods
and core-barrel head by means of a left-hand threaded steel cone at-
tached to several lengths of pipe which could be bolted together to pre-
vent unscrewing. The cone was screwed into the drill rod, and being
of hard steel it was able to make a thread for itself, thus obtaining a
grip on the rod which could then be easily unscrewed. After the head
was removed from the core-barrel, the core inside was chopped out with
the chopping bit and after thoroughly washing out the hole, the core
barrel was raised to the surface.
Delays occurred very seldom however, and the work was carried
on with very good dispatch. As an example of the time necessary for
drilling, the time required for the drilling through rock alone in Hole
four will be cited. In this hole it required two men 82 hours to drill
61.6 feet of rock. The time required for the actual drilling was 59
hours; for "lifting"—18 hrs. 35 minutes; and for delays, 4 hrs. 25 minutes.


SOME PHASES OF HYDRAULICS*
By Professor Gardner S. Williams, '89.
Not infrequently reference is made to the Science of Hydraulics, but
if one gives the subject close scrutiny he will be quite likely to conclude
that as yet it has hardly reached the dignity of a science and at the present
time should rather be classed as merely an art.
Take up any modern text-book on hydraulics and the treatment of the
questions therein discussed is along essentially the same lines as were
proposed by DuBuat at the beginning of the last century. The phenomena
are explained upon the theory that water flows in straight lines or layers
and that the loss of head in a flowing stream varies as the square of the
velocity from some imagined connection with the laws of freely falling
bodies. The flow over a submerged weir is treated as being made up of
two parts, the submerged portion following one law and the unsubmerged
another.
The first of these assumptions is perhaps natural and in some cases
may not be seriously astray; the second is excusable since experimental
errors are frequently sufficient to mask the true law, especially when only
a few observations are made on any one pipe and a comparatively small
range of velocity is covered, but the last is the height of absurdity.
Even so eminent an experimenter as the late Hamilton Smith, Jr.,
whose "Hydraulics" is certainly the most satisfactory work on the subject
in our language, spent an immense amount of labor in comparing the results
of weir experiments by different observers and entirely overlooked in his
analysis the influence of different methods of reading head.
The late Mr. James B. Francis, than whom no mort careful experi-
menter has ever lived, based certain conclusions on the result of a single
experiment, which by chance was the only one that could have been made
which would not have given him an indication of conditions existing, which,
on his authority have ever since been understood to be absent
Experiments may appear to prove all sorts of notions, and when the
investigator gives only his conclusions he precludes forever his work from
aiding further in the true solution of his problems. To those experi-
menters who, like Darcy, Bazin, Francis, Fteley, Stearns, Freeman and
Fitzgerald, have given us first of all the facts as they observed them,
hydraulics owes much and will owe much more as time passes. To those
who have given simply their conclusions from unpublished experiments,
*[This article is reprinted, with a few corrections -and additions, from
1003 Technic.—Ed.]


hydraulics owes next to nothing, and oftentimes a debit should be charged
against them for misleading.
History.—While to Bossut1 and DuBuat* is due the credit of laying the
foundations of our present knowledge of Hydraulics about one hundred
years ago, it is only within the last half century that marked advances have
been made, in taking the subject beyond the doors of laboratory buildings.
Hydraulics may be divided into four parts, viz:
The measurement of water, the conduction of water, water power, and
water transportation, taking the last in is broad sense to include harbor
works, river improvements and canals. Only the first two can be included
within the limits of this discussion.
In the measurement of water the Americans took the lead with the
experiments at Lowell, Mass., by Mr. James B. Francis on the flow of
water over weirs and the determination of discharge of open channels by
means of floats, from 1841 to 1855, the work being carried out on a scale
of magnitude that has been exceeded in only one series of recorded experi-
ments where volumetric measurement was attempted, and with an accuracy
and attention to detail that has served as a model for all experimenters
since.* Mr. Francis may be regarded as the father of weir measurement
in America, but he has been duly followed by Messrs. Fteley and Stearns
in their work on the Boston Water Supply from 1876 to 1880,' and in their
hands the current meter for accurate work in small channels was brought
to a very high degree of perfection. In measuring volumetrically the flow
over a weir 19 feet long at a head of 1.6 feet, involving a discharge of 130
cubic feet per second, these investigators made a record that is not likely
to be surpassed. Hamilton Smith, Jr., has also added valuable experimental
data to this branch of the subject. Mr. Hiram F. Mills, of Lawrence,
Mass., at one time an assistant to Mr. Francis, and finally, on the death of
Mr. Francis, his successor as Engineer of Canals and Locks at Lowell,
made at the Essex Mills and elsewhere in Lawrence, between 1870 and
1880, a very extensive investigation upon the measurement of discharge
by means of the Pitot Tube, an instrument first practically applied by
Henry Darcy at Paris about 1850.* Since Mr. Mills' investigations" the
Pitot Tube in various modified forms has been in regular use for measuring
the water consumed for power purposes by the various manufacturing
establishments at Lawrence. It is greatly to be regretted that during a
long and busy life Mr. Mills has never found it possible to prepare for
publication any of the large amount of valuable data and information
which he collected, and no less than four independent investigations have
since retravelled portions of the field so fully covered by him long before.
The first of these subsequent investigators was Col. Henry Flad of St.

Louis, whose experiments were carried on upon the water mains of that
city about 1884 and whose results have never been published except in
connection with the U. S. Patent office' where his conclusions are set forth
in various patents on apparatus devised by him.
The remaining three investigations were carried on quite simultaneously
though entirely independently from 1896 to 1000 by Mr. William M. White
on the Sewerage Works of New Orleans, Mr. Edward S. Cole on the
water system of Terre Haute, and by the writer and his associates on the
water system of Detroit. These later investigations have all been brought
together and discussed in the Transactions Am. Soc. C. E. Vol. XLVII.
In 1888 Mr. Clemens Herschel, who had been formerly an assistant to
Mr. Francis at Lowell, presented to the profession' his invention of the
Venturi meter which has proved the most useful means of continuous
measurement of the flow of water in pipes yet devised.
Between 1888 and 1890 the accuracy of the nozzle for measuring water
was demonstrated in experiments at Lawrence, Mass., by Mr. John R.
Freeman," a former assistant of Mr. Mills, and one of the most convenient
means of temporarily determining discharge in moderate quantities was
thus placed at the disposal of engineers.
The subject of water meters for application to small quantities hardly
comes within the scope of this review.
The leading foreign investigators in the line of the measurement of
water have been Poncellet, Lesbros and Boileau in France from 1830 to
1850, and Henry Bazin, 1886 to 1898, the last named having contributed
more to our knowledge of the laws and phenomena of Hydraulics as
included in the first two subdivisions than any person in history. Begin-
ning his work as an assistant to Henry Darcy in his renowned experiments*
upon the flow of water in pipes at the Chaillot Water Works Stations,
Paris, from 1849 to 1851, he was further associated with his chief in plan-
ning the experiments upon open channels, and on the premature death of
M. Darcy was left to complete the investigation which extended from 1855
to 1858, the results being published10 at Paris in 1865, and they constitute
one of the most valuable volumes in hydraulic literature.
After remaining in obscurity, so far as experimental hydraulics was
concerned, for so long a period that an eminent writer referred to him as
"the late M. Bazin," he again entered the field of investigation with a dis-
cussion of the variations of velocity at the same point in a running stream"
and the contraction of the liquid vein,1* and made, from 1886 to 1898, at

Dijon, France, the most extensive investigations of the flow of water over
weirs yet undertaken," and followed this by an investigation of the distri-
bution of velocities in circular conduits."
Coming now to the flow of water in pipes the first series of experi-
ments conducted on an extended scale were those of Darcy mentioned
above, which for many years stood as the only reliable work on pipes of
commercial size, and little was added in the way of systematic knowledge,
until Hamilton Smith, Jr.," collected the subsequent data, carefully culling
out much that was imperfect, and adding several valuable series of obser-
vations of his own.
Outside of Darcy and Bazin about the only foreign experimenter whose
work has contributed to our knowledge of this branch of the subject with
pipes of commercial sizes is Dr. Lampe, whose experiments upon the Danzig
pipe line," though in many respects imperfect, have been a valuable addi-
tion. Among American experiments especially deserving of mention
are those of Mr. Frederic P. Stearns," upon the 48" Rosemary siphon
of the Boston water supply when new, and those of Mr. Desmond Fitz-
gerald" on the same pipe some twenty years later, in both a tuberculated
condition and after it was cleaned, which together make one of the most
valuable series of experiments on record; the experiments at Rochester"
by Mr. Emil Kuichling; those on the East Jersey Water Co.'s steel mains
under the direction of Mr. Clemens Herschcl," and those on steel and
wood stave pipe at Ogden," Utah, by Messrs. Marx, Wing and Hoskins;
a series at Los Angeles on wood stave pipe by Arthur Adams," and two
series at Seattle by Theron A. Noble.n The work of Mr. Elliot C. Clark
on the Boston main drainage brick tunnel" and by Mr. Geo. H. Benzen-
berg on the Milwaukee" brick sewer outlet should also be mentioned, as
well as experiments by Mr. Alphonse Ftelcy upon the Sudbury aqueduct of
Boston." But by far the most extensive, accurate and complete investiga-
tion by an American, and one that is surpassed if at all only by the work
of Darcy, was that of Mr. John R. Freeman upon the hydraulics of fire
streams" made at Lawrence from 1888 to 1890.
Experiments of importance have also been made at Detroit" by the
writer and his colleagues, Messrs. Clarence W. Hubbell and George H.
Fenkell; and at the Hydraulic Laboratory" of Cornell University by

Messrs. A. V. Saph and E. W. Schoder, and by Messrs. Arthur Adams
and W. E. Wilson.
Since the foregoing paragraphs were published in The Michigan
Technic for 1903, there has been completed and published* a more
comprehensive and exact series of investigations upon "The Resistances
to the Flow of Water in Pipes" by Messrs Saph and Schoder, carried
on under the writer's supervision at the Hydraulic Laboratory of the
College of Civil Engineering of Cornell University, in which for the
first time so far as records indicate, the influence of the distribution
of velocites in the flowing stream was recognized.
A valuable contribution on the hydraulic transportation of sand may
be found in a paper on the Washington Water Supply."
With the preceding brief outline of our sources of knowledge in these
two branches of the subject it may be proper to consider the present status.
Flow in Pipes.—Considering, first, the flow of water in pipes, it will
be remembered that it is ordinarily taught that the loss of head due to the
.flow of water in pipes varies as the square of the velocity, which may be
expressed by the formula H = ct?. Obviously if the above statement be
correct, then for any given pipe, c in this formula must be a constant. If
it is not a constant, or sufficiently near one so that its deviation can be
charged to experimental errors, then as obviously, H does not vary as w*.
Now in view of the fact that in all the experiments on record there are
less than half a dozen in which c is a constant, or anything near one, it
seems a little strange that nearly all the text-books should teach the above
law as the correct one, but such is nevertheless the case. Before the
days of logarithms this might have been permissible on the grounds of
convenience, but as the logarithm was a contemporary of the oldest of
our flow formulas there is little excuse for it today. As the application
of logarithms to the solution of such problems as are involved in the
determination of the correct law of variation in the above case may not
be as familiar to all as they have become to some during the past few-
years, the process will be explained.
If H varies as any power of v we may write H = mvn, which is at
once recognized as a general equation of a plane curve passing through
the origin. If m and n are constants in any given case, as they always
appear to be in equations of flow, we may express the equation in the
logarithmic form thus: log H = logm + nlogv, which is seen to be the
equation of a straight line whose intercept on the H or Y axis is log m,
and whose slope is «. Consequently if we plot the logarithms of H and
v from our observations wc get a straight line from whose inclination n
can be determined, and m can be gotten by placing log v = o, ». e., v = I,
whence as might have been noticed m = H for v=l.
If instead of the logarithms a paper be used which is ruled to a logar-
ithmic scale, which may be made by using an ordinary slide rule scale for
JTrans. Am. Soc. C. E., Vol. LI.
"Trans. Am. Soc. C. E., Vol. LVII.


ruling it up—the 10-inch base or square root scale will be found most sat-
isfactory—the observations may be plotted directly and much labor saved.
If such plottings be made of existing experiments it will be found
that in the case of all those on ordinary water pipe sizes, 3" diameter
and above, the exponent falls between 1.70 and 2.10 and that the higher
exponents are found only in the cases of rough pipes, and with ordinarily
smooth pipes the exponent will always be in the neighborhood of 1.80
and as an average value 1.86 may be taken. The value of m in the equation
H = mvn is a function of the diameter, of the form in = k/dP and the
value of p will be found to be about 1.25.
Putting r the hydraulic radius in place of d we have a new constant
k', and transposing and combining constants the equation H = my* =
K/d1-MXv1-M = A,'/r1-J5X^1-88 may be written in the form so familiar as
the Chezy formula, but with different exponents v = c r°-8T s°-M, a form
similar to that proposed by Dr. Lampe, v = cr°-8B* .jo.bsb, and to that pro-
posed by Mr. Allen Hazen and the writer, v = cr°-"&gt; s0-**," any of which
is a more rational formula for ordinary straight pipes than is v = cr1/2 j1/2,
as in the former c will be a constant while in the latter it will be a
variable. But inasmuch as n varies with roughness and possibly other
causes, so m also varies and much more widely, whence it follows that
no general equation can be made applicable to all pipes without a range
of both the exponent of r and s, but with a formula of this type, if the
variations be taken care of in the coefficient its range will even then be
much less than in the case of the Chezy formula.
In the foregoing formula the value of K was found by Saph and
Schoder to range from 0.29 to 0.47 for ordinary pipes and a mean value
of 0.38 to be a safe average for all but very rough ones. The velocity
form corresponding to this then becomes v = 69 &lt;f0-67 J0-84 or v = 170
fO.«7 jO.m anj rnay be considered the most satisfactory pipe formula yet
devised and applicable to diameters from 0.01 to 10 feet.
Flow in Open Channels.—By reason of the influence of the distri-
bution of velocities in a flowing stream upon the losses of head involved
in maintaining the flow, no general formula for open channels can be
devised which does not involve in addition to the factors of a pipe form-
ula, one expressing the shape or form of the cross-section, and on
account of the limited number of experiments available of sufficient accur-
acy to command confidence, no such factor has yet been deduced.
Consequently, in all formulae for open channels a wide range of the
coefficient is to be expected, and the result of any such formula is there-
fore to be looked upon as little more than an approximation unless the
coefficient be chosen by one of large experience in similar cases.
Flow over IVeirs.—Coming now to our knowledge of the flow of
water over weirs there are at the present time three formulae in common
use in the United States.
"Eng. Record, March 28, 1903.


The oldest and also the most popular is that of Mr. Francis'.
Q = 3-33 (L — o.inH) H»/» wherein:
Q = the discharge in cubic feet per second.
L = the length of the weir in feet.
n = the number of end contractions.
H = the depth on the weir in feet measured from the level of the
crest to the level of still water, and therefore = h +Ao where k is the
observed head 6 ft. upstream from the weir and ha is the head to which
the velocity of flow at that point is due. As an exact determination of
the value ha to be applied in a general case has never been established
Mr. Francis presented the following empiric" formula derived by the aid
of the calculus for the value of H to be used in the above equation.
H—[(h-\-ha) */» — A«/2] 2/* so that for a weir without end con-
tractions, n =: o, the whole formula becomes
Q = 3-33L[(h + ha)*/* — h*/*]*/», ha being the head to which the
mean velocity of the flowing stream is due at the plane of measurement
of head, and is obtained by a series of approximations from the Q first
computed without the correction.
The next formula is that of Fteley and Stearns, which is:
Q =3.31 LH 3/2 + 0.007 L and must be corrected for velocity of ap-
proach by adding to the second member a quantity ranging from 1.3 to
1.5 ha as determined above. This formula is not applicable to weirs with
end contractions.
As these latter investigators experimented upon weirs of different
heights it is possible from their observations to plot a curve giving a
more accurate correction for the velocity, and the results of these inves-
tigations showed that even when the head on the weir was equal to its
height above the bottom of the channel of approach there was no change
in the laws governing the flow from those controlling when the head was
only one-tenth of the height. This was an important advance as Mr.
Francis had confined the application of his formula to cases where the
head was not more than one-third the height of the weir.
The third formula is that of Bazin, and it differs from the others
in providing for the velocity of approach in its coefficient, so that there
arc no corrections to make as in the two other cases. The formula like
that of Fteley and Stearns is only applicable to weirs without end con-
tractions.
For English units this formula is:
Q = (0.405 + 0.00984A) [1 + 0.055 (&gt;»/(/&gt; + h))»] £,/» V 2gh wherein p
is the height of the weir, the other units being as before.
The question is often raised as to which formula gives the more
accurate results, and it has been the writer's privilege to conduct a long
series of experiments on two weirs of heights of 11.24 ft. and 6.65 ft. and
of 16 ft. lengths over which the water could be passed in succession, for
the purpose of throwing light on this question.
The conclusion is that for small heads there is practically no choice.


That the Francis formula becomes inaccurate after passing the limits
set for it by its author, viz:
Heads between 0.5 ft. and 2.0 ft. and a height of weir not less than 3 h.
That either of the other formulae give accurate results for heads of
from 0.2 ft. to 4.0 ft., and so long as h does not exceed the height of the
weir but that the head must be read at points corresponding to those used
by the experimenters originally, viz., for the Fteley and Stearns formula,
6 ft. upstream and near the level of the crest, and for the Bazin formula
about 2V1 to 3 times the height of the weir upstream from it and near
the bottom of the channel of approach.
All the weir formula are based on the assumption that the head meas-
ured by the experimenters was the elevation of the surface of the water
above the weir crest, a condition which is only attained for each location,
at one particular head by reason of the effect of the velocity of the stream
upon the pressure transmitted through the orifices to gage tube or pail.
For small heads this difference is too small to be measured, but for high
heads the surface of the flowing water will often stand nearly or quite an
inch higher than that in the gage pail, and if the pail be connected to an
orifice in the side wall of the canal in the plane of the weir the surface
of the water in the pail will be at about 0.65 of the actual vertical distance
from the crest of the weir to the surface of the sheet flowing over it.
For this reason the writer prefers to measure the head upon a weir
by means of the scratch of a sharp plumb-bob suspended on a steel tape
from a fixed point above the water, to any of the supposedly more
delicate devices, when high heads are to be handled.


EDITORIALS
The Board of this year takes pleasure in presenting the first num-
ber of the 1008 Tech NIC. It is somewhat late in making its appearance
due to various causes. We refrained from going to press for some time
in hopes that two articles promised might be incorporated in our first
number. One is between these covers, the other will appear in our next
issue.
Indications point to the fact that our second number will come from
the press on time, and we are bending all our energies toward effecting
that result
We desire to thank the Advisory Board and also Dean Cooley and
Professor Williams for their help and encouragement. One of the
things that in years to come will be one of the most pleasant memories
of our college days, is our meeting, in the office and in the class room,
with these kind and thorough men.
We here take occasion to express our belief that no senior class
in the Engineering Department has been so fortunate in the number,
quality and range of elective courses which may be selected. And we
have noted particularly the large number that are attending classes out-
side of the special branch in which each seeks a degree. It appears to
us that there was never so happily met, a combination of required and
elective courses, such as the Special Announcement shows. For instance,
there might be mentioned the courses in Hydraulic Turbines, Steam
Turbines, Gas Engines, Power Plants, Public Utilities, Water Supply
Engineering, Experimental Hydraulics, Testing Materials, Electric Rail-
ways, Distribution of Electricity, Economics, and several others, in all
of which there is much interest shown. Of the additions to the Faculty
this year, we feel to mention especially Professor de Muralt in the Elec-
trical Department, Assistant Professor Griffith in Civil Engineering, and
Mr. Zowski, Mechanical. These men are each of large experience in
their several fields, and their work has taken on a character of thorough-
ness and of much influence with the students. No doubt seniors of every
year, and of all schools, have felt or feel as we do, nevertheless we con-
gratulate ourselves on being here in Michigan in 1908.
We wish to call attention to our new Constitution and By-Laws
as adopted May 18, 1907, and to mention particularly, that the method
heretofore pursued whereby a member could by paying a nominal sum
receive the Technic for life, has been discontinued. As one old grad-
uate expressed it when he sent in his subscription, the Technic made a


very poor bargain. We shall of course keep our contract with those old
members and count it a privilege to do so. They are always interested
in our work, and offer much assistance to us from time to time.
There has been a very gratifying response to the circulars sent out
to the alumni in the endeavor to build up a subscription list. The good
wishes and encouragement, coming from all parts of the country, is
very pleasing to us. We feel that we are gathering strength, though
slowly, for the time when we shall issue a quarterly and then a monthly;
at which time a five or six year course will be more popular, giving more
time to the student, or a financial recompense will be the inducement to
assume the work; when the Technic shall have its desks, typewriter and
files at some convenient place in the building, easily accessible to stu-
dents, Faculty and alumni. The Society of course has its reading room
with between thirty and forty of the best engineering and popular mag-
azines on its tables, and all hours of the forenoon find it filled with mem-
bers reading and studying. But the Technic needs its place and we
believe it will find it when added room and facilities are obtained.
In this number we publish a list of the graduate members of the
Society, indicating merely where they reside. Lack of space forbids add-
ing street and number. The list is as complete as the records permit,
containing the names of those only who were members in their senior
year. If any names have been omitted we would be pleased to receive
them, also the addresses of those not noted. There is also a complete
list of the active member and the class to which each belongs added.
The half-tone appearing as our frontispiece was kindly loaned us
by the Alumnus, in the current number of which are a Short History of
The Engineering Department, by Professor Chas. S. Denison, and bio-
graphical sketches of many of the graduates of the years 1860-1895. The
articles arc very interesting, and the whole is a remarkable record ein-
bacing, as the work of the graduates of the Department, many of the
most noted engineering feats of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
Several of these sketches are given more at length in previous num-
bers of the Technic, and reference to our index herein published will
show in what numbers.
The preparation of this index has been to us more a pleasure than
a duty; it is the best record that we could compile of the work of the
past and of the growth of engineering training here in Michigan; and
lately several inquiries have come to us as to where such information
could be obtained. We believe that we have hit the nail squarely on
the head. In preparing the index we have placed titles under those
heads where, to our mind, they would most likely be sought. No effort
at cross references has been attempted.


THE MICHIGAN TECH NIC
Apropos of the many worthy efforts now being made by the stu-
oents to raise money for the Michigan Union, we beg to refer to plans
for a Union Club House as drawn up by Professor John R. Allen and
published in the May, 1905, Technic. A study of these plans will, we
think, bring to mind more clearly the advantages, yea, even the blessings,
that will come to alumni, Faculty and student body by the complete es-
tablishment of such an institution. This winter's experience with the
present Club House has more than proven that it is an absolute necessity
here in Ann Arbor. Practically every date is taken for a month ahead
for smokers and banquets of classes, technical and honor societies, clubs
and social organizations of the University. We know of many alumni
who have found it a very pleasant place to dine and rest, and to mingle
with the "fellows" once more.
As noted in the program of the first semester our annual reception
to the Engineering Faculty was given on Dec. 6, 1907, in the Society's
room and the library. The large rooms and the hall between were full to
overflowing, everybody talking and laughing and having a good time.
Refreshments were served and toasts given with responses from members
of the Faculty and students.
There has come to us, from the Mining Reporter Publishing Com-
pany, Denver, Colo., a manual of some 225 pages upon Mineral Land Sur-
veying, by James Underhill, Ph.D., M. E., U. S. Deputy Mineral Surveyor
for Colorado. The work appeared as a serial in the Mining Reporter,
and describes the methods used at the present time in the survey of
mineral lands in the western portion of the United States. It is a val-
uable little book especially to those who have occasion to deal with the
intricate and confusing problems which always arise in the survey of
mineral land districts. In the several chapters Direct Solor Observa-
tions, Solor Attachments, Measurements, Location Surveys, Patent Sur-
veys, Patent Field Notes, Land Office and Records, Examination for
Commission U. S. Deputy Mineral Surveyor, and Patenting of Mineral
Lands are treated.'
As a considerable portion of the expense of publishing the Technic
js paid from advertising, we ask for our advertisers the support and pat-
ronage of all our readers. We firmly believe that all of our advertisers
are first-class, reliable firms and trust that when circumstances allow,
they will be favored as they have favored us.

EAST RIVER TUNNEL FROM SOUTH FERRY TO
JORALEMON STREET*
By Frederick C. Noble, C.E., '94.
EARLY TUNNEL SCHEMES.
Projects for a tunnel under the East River, to connect Brooklyn
with the lower end of Manhattan Island, all appear to be of compara-
tively recent date.
About 1800, a tunnel was proposed crossing just below and parallel
to Brooklyn Bridge. The tunnel was to be entirely in rock, with grades
of 25 per cent, on each side, and cables were to be used for the motive
power.
* Read before the Brooklyn Engineers' Club, February, 190&amp;


In 1891, some studies and borings were made by Mr. C. M. Jacobs
for a deep tunnel in rock from Whitehall St., Manhattan, to Atlantic
Ave., Brooklyn.
In the same year, the New York &amp; Brooklyn Tunnel Co. was incor-
porated to build a tunnel from Greenwich and Morris Sts., Manhattan,
to Smith St. and Atlantic Ave., Brooklyn. The proposed location was
later changed to one from Ann St. and Broadway to Furman and Mid-
dagh Sts., and an ordinance authorizing its construction was passed by
the New York Board of Aldermen; but similar authorization was denied
by the Brooklyn board, and the project was abandoned.
In 1894 the New York, New Jersey &amp; Eastern R. R. Co. was in-
corporated to build a tunnel from Jersey City via Cortlandt St. and
Maiden Lane, Manhattan, to Atlantic and Flatbush Ave., Brooklyn. The
company was popularly supposed to have the backing of the Pennsyl-
vania and Long Island Railroads.
In 1897, the Atlantic Avenue Improvement Commission reported
in favor of a tunnel from West St. via Cortlandt St. and Maiden Lane,
Manhattan, under the East River, and via Pineapple St., Fulton St. and
Flatbush Ave., to the Long Island Railroad terminal at Atlantic Ave.
Like the others, this tunnel was to be entirely in rock under the river
and in Brooklyn as far as the Borough Hall; at which point the tunnel
was to be 115 ft. below grade, rising thence by an easy grade through
Fulton St. and Flatbush Ave. to just below the surface at Atlantic Ave.
PRESENT TUNNEL PROPOSED.
The history of the present tunnel dates from 1900. In February of
that year, the Board of Rapid Transit Railroad Commissioners, having
just executed the Manhattan subway contract for the City, directed its
Chief Engineer to investigate and report as to the practicability and cost
of extending the system to Brooklyn by means of a tunnel from South
Ferry. The route in Brooklyn was not specified and the Board pro-
ceeded to hold a number of hearings to learn public sentiment in this
respect
LEGISLATION.
In the meantime, a question arose as to whether the Board, which
had been organized before consolidation under the Rapid Transit Act
of 1894, had authority to consider a route in Brooklyn. To meet this
objection, a bill was introduced and passed in the Legislature extending
the jurisdiction of the Board to all five boroughs, and this became a law
in April with the acceptance of the bill by the City and its approval by
the Governor.


HEARINGS AS TO ROUTE
At the public hearings in May, which were largely attended by
representatives from various civic bodies, arguments were advanced prin-
cipally in favor of two different routes; one via Joralemon St., Fulton
St. and Flatbush Ave. to Atlantic Ave., and the other via Hamilton Ave.
to Bay Ridge. At the hearings it proved that the former route, which
was the one adopted later on, had the support of the largest and most
representative of these organizations.
PROVISIONAL ASSURANCE TO OPERATE.
In September, moreover, informal assurance was given the Board
by the Rapid Transit Subway Construction Co., the general contractor
for the Manhattan subway, that in the event the Joralemon St. route
should be adopted, that company would offer a bid for its construction
and operation.
ROUTE ADOPTED AND APPROVED.
After lengthy study of the two routes, and consideration of their
comparative merits and costs, the Board finally adopted, by resolution
of January 24, 1901, the Joralemon St. route; and authorized its presi-
dent to apply for the approval of the municipal authorities. At the
subsequent hearings held before the Aldermanic Committee on Streets
and Highways and the Railroad Committee of the Council, considerable
opposition to the proposed plan was developed by advocates of the Ham-
ilton Ave. route, and it was not until June 1, 1901, that the necessary
approval of the Municipal Assembly and the Mayor were secured.
LEGAL PROCESSES.
The Board as required by law endeavored to obtain the consent
of the owners of one-half in value of the property along the streets of
the proposed route. These were refused, and the only alternative was to
take the matter to the Supreme Court of the State. Two commissions,
one for each borough, of three members each, were appointed by fhe
Appellate Division in the following September and October, and these
commissions, after holding hearings, reported favorably to the Court,
which confirmed their findings in January, 1902.
DEPARTMENTAL CONSENTS.
The necessary consent of the Secretary of War had been obtained
in June for the construction of the under river portion of the route,
and the consent of the City Departments of Parks and Docks, which
were also required, were obtained in July and December, 1001, respectively.


PRELIMINARY PLANS.
In the meantime, the engineering department had been preparing
detailed plans and estimates. The first studies for the river portion were
made with a view to building the tunnel in sections, sinking them into
place, and joining them together. This plan was found impracticable
and was given up.
CONTRACTS FOR BORINGS.
Diamond drill and wash borings were made in the river bed on
the tunnel line between August, 1001, and January, 1002. The work was
let to two different contractors; the wash borings to F. W. Miller, and
the diamond drill borings to the United Engineering &amp; Contracting Co.
WASH BORINGS.
The wash borings were made about every 80 feet across the river,
by means of an outfit mounted on a small steam-lighter, which was
anchored and located in position for each boring by the use of range-
poles and sextant-sights. The casing-pipe was 2lA" diameter and the
wash pipe Ya," . On account of the current, borings were made as much
as possible during slack water. . ,
DIAMOND DRILL BORINGS.
After the completion of the wash borings, seven diamond drill
borings were made at various points where the evidence of the wash
borings seemed inconclusive. The diamond drill outfit was mounted
in each case on a staging built on a cluster of six or seven piles, driven
during slack water, and strongly drawn together at the top with chains
by a steam-winch. The diameter of the core obtained was Ji". The
drill rod was V/i"&gt; working inside a 4", and for the deeper holes a &amp;",
casing pipe.
EVIDENCE OF BORINGS.
The borings showed that the tunnel would pass generally through
rock on the Manhattan side to a point near the middle of the river, and
again through an up-crop of rock before reaching the Brooklyn side.
They also established the fact that coarse sand and gravel overlaid the
rock on the Manhattan side, and extended through the tunnel line in the
Brooklyn slip; while for the remaining distance,—from the Brooklyn
side to the rock and between the two rock formations,—the material to
be encountered consisted of the fine sand and clay ordnarily found in the
lower part of the city. Rock cores and samples of the wash-borings
were taken and preserved. •;


PREPARATION OF CONTRACT AND PLANS.
The early months of 1903 were occupied in the preparations of
plans and a form of contract to include both construction and operation.
On June 12, 1902, the Board adopted the plans and the form of contract
that had been prepared, and authorized advertising for bids.
Three bids for construction and operation were opened on July 21.
One was from the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company, of $7,000,000;
and the other two were from the Rapid Transit Subway Construction
Company, of $2,000,000 and $3,000,000. The latter two bids were alike
in every respect, except that the larger amount was coupled with an
offer to construct a cut-off in the Manhattan subway system between
Union Square and Forty-second St. on Broadway.
CONTRACT AWARDED.
The contract was awarded to the Rapid Transit Subway Construc-
tion Co., on the basis of the lower bid, July 24, 1902; and was executed
as "Contract No. 2," September 11, 1902. The contract price of $2,000,000
was estimated to be about one-fifth of the actual cost of construction.
SUB-CONTRACTS.
The work was sublet for construction in four sections by the gen-
eral contractor. The river tunnel section was let to the New York
Tunnel Company about the end of the year.
ROUTE.
The route of the river tunnel section as contracted for, begins at a
point at the east side of Battery Park opposite Pearl Street, curving to
the south and east through Battery Park, passng the bulkhead line on
the river tangent at the foot of Whitehall St., continuing under the
East River to the Brooklyn side, thence curving east to take the direc-
tion of Joralemon St., and ends at Clinton Street. After construction
began a deviation in the line of 4° to the south was made near the
Manhattan side to allow for passing under the Brooklyn slip instead of
under Pier No. 17 to the north as originally planned.
GRADE.
The grade is 3.1% downward on each side of the river, execpt for
a short distance near the middle, where a 0.5% grade upward toward
Brooklyn was later introduced. This portion is joined to the steeper
grades on each side by vertical curves of 10,000 ft. radius. The tunnel


is everywhere below water level, except far about 700 feet at the east
or Brooklyn end. The lowest point reached by the tunnel is 94 feet
below mean high water.
GENERAL DESCRIPTION.
The tunnel consists of two circular single track tubes of the usual
cast iron ring construction. They are is'-6" internal diameter, and run
side by side 28 feet apart on centers, except under Joralemon Street,
where this distance is decreased to 26 feet. The tubes are lined through-
out with concrete, and are grouted externally.
MATERIAL.
The material on the Manhattan side from the shaft east to the
lowest point of the tunnel, a distance of about 2,700 feet, consisted almost
entirely of rock. About half way from the low point to the Brooklyn
side another stretch of rock, about 400 feet in length, was passed through.
This formation is supposed to be continuous with Coenties Reef further
north. The rock was generally found to be a good character of mica
schist or gneiss, and except in places where the rock covering was slight
or lacking no timbering was required.
For the remaining distance the material consisted generally of sand
of varying degrees of fineness. Under Joralemon St. and part way out
in the slip between piers 17 and 18 the sand was of ordinary coarseness
and contained considerable gravel, cobbles and boulders of all sizes.
Between the two rock formations and east of the Brooklyn reef the
s^nd was found to be extremely fine and often contained a certain ad-
mixture of clay. This material is of the same nature as the quicksand
encountered in foundations in the lower part of Manhattan Island, and
shows a similar marked tendency to run whenever disturbed.
SHAFTS AND HEADINGS.
Excavation for the Manhattan shaft, located in the Battery Park
enclosure opposite South Ferry, began March 4, 1903. The shaft meas-
ured 14 feet by 52 feet in plan, taking in the headings of both tubes,
and extended to the tunel subgrade, about 45 feet below the surface.
It was sheeted on all sides with 5" tongued and grooved sheeting driven
to the rock line, which was reached approximately half way down.
The shaft was equipped with two lifts, one for each heading,
operated by a single-drum hoisting engine with a continuous cable. Tun-
nel spoil was hoisted to the surface, run out on a trestle leading to a
dock west of the U. S. Barge Office, and there dumped into scows.


The headings for the north and south tubes were started east from
the Manhattan shaft on April 9 and April 16, 1903, respectively. By the
end of May, 1906, the headings reached a point near the end of the
rock formation, where further progress was stopped temporarily to in-
stall shields. In September the advance was resumed with the new
shields.
The first Brooklyn shafts .one for each tube, were located in Jora-
lemon St. about 1,300 feet inland from the river, just west of Henry St.,
and about 700 feet from the end of the tunnel section. Excavation of
the south shaft began April 16, 1903, and for the north shaft June 10,
1903. They were eacli 20 feet by 24 feet in plan, sheeted with 4" tongued
and grooved sheeting, and extended 65 feet below the surface to the
bottom of the tunnel.
The first portion of the tunnel to be built in Brooklyn was the
length of about 700 feet in each tube east from the shafts to the end of
the section. The shield for the south tube was started east July 10,
1903, and reached the end of the section January 11, 1904. The shield
for the north tube was started east September 15, 1903, and leached
the end of the section January 16, 1904.
The shields for the west headings were being equipped while the
first pair progressed east. The south shield began the advance west from
the shaft Novemebr 12, 1903, and the north shield February 2, 1904.
After the bulkhead line was passed, caissons were sunk for the new
shafts just west of Furman St., and these were put into use in April,
1905, after which the original shafts were filled up. The new shafts each
measured .9 feet by 13 feet in plan, and were sunk 30 feet below the
surface to the top of the tubes, to which they were then connected.
The final meeting between the headngs took place between the two
rock formations under the river. The north shields met December 14,
1906, and the south shields met March 1, 1907. They were then dis-
mantled, leaving the outer shells in place, after which the cast iron lining
was compelted.
Material removed from the tunnel through the Furman and Henry
St. shafts was hoisted to the surface by means of a lift, with which each
shaft was provided, dumped into overhead bins discharging at the bottom
into carts to be teamed away.
TUNNELING METHODS.
All tunneling operations were carried on in compressed air, except
in the Brooklyn headings east of the Henry St. shafts, where the tubes
are above water level, and inside the bulkhead line at South Ferry, where
the leakage could be easily controlled by pumping. The working pres-


sure varied from a few pounds to a maximum of 42 pounds to the
square inch above atmospheric pressure at the deepest section under the
middle of the river. The tubes were divided into working chambers by
brick or concrete bulkheads at intervals, into each of which were built
two locks for passage of workmen and materials.
In the soft material the tunneling was by shield, under the protec-
tion of which the cast iron lining was erected. There were six shields,
one for each of the four headings from the Henry Street shafts and
one in each of the Manhattan headings, which were set up in shield
chambers when these headings had reached the end of the rock forma-
tion. Enough material was removed at one time to permit the shield to
be forced ahead by hydraulic pressure so that one ring could be erected,
after which the operation was repeated. Breast boards were used against
the face where the material showed a tendency to run or slough off. In
the fine sand a water jet was used to soften the material in the lower
part of the face, permitting it to be blown out of the working chamber
through a discharge pipe by the tunnel pressure.
On the Manhattan side, where the material was rock, excavation
was made in two stages by the ordinary top heading and bench method.
Where the rock was of good quality and sufficiently thick overhead no
roof timbering was necessary, and the heading was carried a considerable
distance ahead of the bench. Otherwise roof timbering was resorted to.
This consisted of 12" x 14" timber arch sets in three segments at inter-
vals of about s feet, with 3" lagging running lengthwise over top and
sides.'
Where the shields encountered rock on the Brooklyn side they were
slid through it, while the excavation was carried well ahead of the shield
wherever possible by a bottom heading. The overhang was then drilled
and blasted down from the shield as it advanced. ,
The shields were cylindrical, i6'-iiJ4" external diameter 0/-6" long,
and with an outer shell of l'/i" metal. The shields were divided in two
main portions, front and back, by a transverse diaphragm of %" metal,
with openings through which materials could be passed. The front por-
tion was reinforced to form a cutting edge, while the rear portion formed
the protection under which the lining was erected. The front portion
was divided into two compartments, an upper and a lower, by a horizontal
platform, which projected 4 feet beyond the cutting edge and was sup-
ported by inclined channel braces to the bottom. An extension was at-
tached to the upper portion of the cutting edge to form a hood, pro-
jecting 3'-6", and this was similarly braced down to the platform. An
interior shell, between the diaphragm and the cutting edge, formed an
annular space within which the hydraulic jacks bore. There were 14 of


LINING TUBE WITH REINEORED CONCRETE, SOUTH TUBE—UNDER-RIVER SECTION


these jacks each 18 inches in diameter, around the circumference, reacting
against the cast iron lining, and capable of exerting a total pressure of
1400 tons on the shield at a hydraulic intensity of 3000 pounds per square
inch. The pump supplying he hydraulic pressure to the jacks was mounted
on a platform following the shield, this platform resting on removable
roller brackets attached to the flanges of the lining. An arrangement of
valves was provided for cutting out any or all of the jacks.
CAST IRON UNING.
The tunnel shell is built up of. flanged cast iron plates, bolted
together by their flanges to form rings, each composed of 8 segments
and a key. The rings are is'-6" internal diameter, 22" in length, l-z/i"
minimum thickness of metal, and 7" to J-%" depth over flanges. All
abuting surfaces are planed, the segments are bolted to the adjoining
ones in the same ring with three 1" bolts, and the rings are bolted to each
other with forty-nine 1" bolts in the circumferential flanges. The weight
of the ring varies according to location; the lighter ones, weighing 731Q
pounds each, being used in rock and above the water level in Brooklyn,
and the heavier ones, weighing 8332 pounds and 9410 pounds each, being
used under the river and for the rest of the work. Many of the seg-
ments, both of the light and heavy sections, cracked under the strains
they were subjected to during construction, and these were removed if
practicable, or if not they were reinforced later with steel rods embedded
in concrete.
The cast iron segments were lifted and swung into position for
bolting up by means of a counterweighted radial arm attached to the
platform behind the shield, and operated by a small air engine mounted
on the platform. Where the tunnel was in rock and there was no shield
the same arrangement was used, and the lining kept generally close to
the bench.
As the lining was erected it was grouted externally through a l%"
tap hole in each segment, closed with a plug. In the rock the space out-
side the lining was hand-packed with stone spalls before being grouted,
and the grout was confined in sections by concrete bulkheads or dams
built in this space at intervals. The grout consisted of equal parts of
crusher dust and cement, fed in at the top and mixed in an enclosed
cylinder with revolving paddles operated by a small air engine. When
sufficiently mixed, air pressure was applied at the top and the grout was
forced through the plug holes and behind the lining by means of a con-
necting rubber hose.
The lining was made watertight by caulking with metallic lead in
the recesses at the inner edges of the joints and grommetting the bolts


under the heads and nuts with a ring of hemp and red lead under a plate
washer.
Reconstruction Deviations from the established grade were caused
by the faulty control of the Brooklyn shields in many places between the
Henry St. shafts and the reef. These necessitated subsequent recon-
struction of parts of the tunnel, especially in the north tube, to avoid too
great an irregularity in the resulting grades, and this was successfully
accomplished without materially interfering with the regular work of fin-
ishing the tunnel.
The method adopted was simple, and consisted generally of removing
the cast iron segments in the lower half of the tunnel section ad replacing
them with new segments, curved to an elliptical outline so as to give more
interior space at the bottom. For a short stretch in each tube near Hicks
St., where the earliest and most marked variations occurred, the upper
half of the tunnel lining was forced outward and upward by heavy hydrau-
lic pressure, sufficiently far into the surrounding soil to permit the con-
struction of a new masonry roof, providing increased clearance. The
total length of tunnel recostructed is 2919 ft., of which 1957 ft. were in
the north tube and 962 ft. in the south tube. The time occupied by the
work was 13 months.
PILES UNDER TUBES.
The matter of the stability of the fine sand each side of the Brooklyn
reef under the loads of moving trains having been questioned by officials
of the Interborough Company, it was considered advisable by them to
provide some auxiliary means of support, such as piles reaching to rock
at intervals under the tubes where they passed through the material in
question. This view was not concurred in by the City engineers, but as
experiments showed that the piles might be driven rapidly without ma-
terially delaying completion, the work was allowed to proceed.
In the midriver section, between the Brooklyn reef and the Manhat-
tan rock formation, 17 concrete pile bents were sunk under the north
tube and 15 under the south. Each bent consists of 2 piles, about 20" in
diameter, spaced 7 ft. apart transversely and about 30 ft. apart longi-
tudinally of the tunnel. The piles were driven to depths ranging from 5
to 40 ft. In the fine sand formation each of the Brooklyn reef, 15 similar
pile bents were sunk in each of the tubes. The pile bents in this section
were spaced about 50 ft. apart longitudinally, and extended to depths
ranging from a few feet to 75 ft. In every case the piles were driven
to hard material.
To drive the piles it was necessary to remove the bottom plates of
three rings below the spring line. The piles were then forced down by
hydraulic jacking in sections, with an outer steel casing filled with con-


crete, reinforced by four longitudinal rods. A 4" pipe ran through the
interior of the pile, and through this pipe a smaller one jetted at the
end. When a firm bearing was reached the piles were connected at the
top by a broad reinforced concrete cradle, and the cast iron lining was
replaced.
CONCRETE LINING.
After making the cast iron lining watertight the air pressure was
removed, and the interior of the shell lined with small stone concrete,
mixed 1:314.
At the bottom under the track the concrete is brought 8" inside the
flanges and levelled at the ends of the ties to afford them a solid bearing.
A concrete bench is built a each side of the track to enclose the seven
single-way tile ducts in each bench for electric cables. At intervals of
300 ft. the duct bench is omitted for a space of 10 ft. to leave a chamber
for splicing the cables, and these are to be covered with iron grat'ngs.
The concrete lining of the roof is brought flush with the inside of
the flanges of the cast iron lining wherever the tunnel is in rock, or under
the land east of the bulkhead line in Brooklyn. For the remaining dis-
tance in soft material under the river the concrete lining is made suffi-
ciently thick to cover the flanges 3" at the upper quarter points, and
further increased in thickness at the crown and spring line on each side
by making the outline flat at these places. In this additional concrete
were embedded three circumferential i%" round rods per ring, extending
over the top arch of 1200, and at the crown sixteen longitudinal iJ4"
round rods in 18' lengths, connected by turnbuckles. In the bottom con-
crete over this same stretch were embedded a corresponding number and
arrangement of circumferential and longitudinal rods. On each side lap-
ping the circumferential rods at the top and bottom are two 1" square
rods per ring placed vertically. The whole reinforcement adds greatly
to the resistance of the tunnel section to deformation.
After the concrete lining was placed it was given a wash of cement
grout as a finish to the surface.
DRAINAGE.
Sumps for collecting the drainage of the tunnel are provided in
concrete-lined cross-passages between the tubes at three places under the
river. One sump is located at the low grade point near the end of the
Manhattan rock formation; one about half way from there to the Man-
hattan shaft, and one in the Brooklyn reef. Each sump is equipped with a
Cameron single-acting pump, operated by compressed air, discharging
through two 6" cast iron drain pipes embedded in the concrete under


the track in each tube, to the permanent shafts on each side of the river,
from which point the water is raised to the sewer by similar pumps of
a larger capacity.
VENTILATION.
There are two permanent shafts, one at South Ferry and one at
Willow Place, Brooklyn, which will serve as ventilating openings as well
as connections for the drainage system and power cables. The working
shaft at South Ferry was enlarged for this purpose, but the Willow Place
shaft was a new one, excavated under air pressure and sealed to the
outside of the tunnel shell. The shafts are lined with reinforced con-
crete, include both tubes of the tunnel, and measure about 14 ft. by 45 ft.
inside in plan. The shafts are equipped with fans electrically operated,
and so arranged that the air may be moved in or out for either of the
tubes. Under ordinary conditions it is expected that adequate ventilation
will be obtained by the movement of air from the passage of trains
through the tubes.
TRACK.
The rails weigh 100 pounds per yard, and are spiked with tie plates
to 6"x8" yellow pine ties spaced 18" centers. The ends of the ties bear
on the concrete lining, and the space between their ends is filled with
concrete flush with the top. The rest of the space between and under
the ties is filled with 2" broken stone ballast.
COMPRESSOR PLANT.
The air supply for maintaining the pressure in the headings and
operating drills, pumps, and hoists, was furnished by a plant on each
side of the river. In the early part of the work the plant proved entirely
inadequate for the necessary supply and had to be greatly increased. As
a result there were considerable periods when only one tube could be
worked at a time.
The Manhattan plant, located in the enclosure at South Ferry, con-
sisted of two large and two small machines, with a combined capacity
of 10,000 cu. ft. free air per minute. The Brooklyn plant, located on
Furman Street just north of the shafts, consisted of five large and five
small machines, with a combined capacity of 22,000 cu. ft. free air per
minute.

THE AMERICAN HIGH SPEED RUNNERS FOR
WATER TURBINES
By S. J. Zowski.
COPYRIGHT, I908, BY S. J. ZOWSKI.
Looking at a modern American standard runner for a water turbine
one is liable to wonder, why the design of such runners is considered to
be one of the most difficult problems in hydraulic engineering. The forms
of the runners are so natural, the buckets and their curvature so simple
that "we fail to see where the pretended difficulties are." As usual in
such cases we forget here again that there is always a direct proportion
between the simplicity of a machine and the amount of brainwork, the
time and efforts that are necessary to produce the same. A brief history
of the evolution of the American turbine, a glance at the reports of the
numerous tests made in the Holyoke testing flume would convince us of
this fact. Indeed the American standard runners, as they are manufactured
now, represent quite a deal of hard and earnest work. Hundreds of
tedious and expensive experiments, many a failure and success had to be
made—an experience of about half a century had to be aggregated first,
before this modern runner type could be produced.
The aim was first: a good efficiency of course. But this was not
all. Already in the early eighties—at a time when the European engin-
eers still were questioning the advantages of the radial inward flow tur-
bine—there were in this country wheels of this type, which yielded effi-
ciencies up to 84%—according to the tests made in Holyoke. And yet
since that time remarkable progress has been made. Following the gen-
eral tendency of modern engineering, the speed and capacity of the
turbines had to be increased. That this meant a new difficulty is evident.
High speed calls for small dimensions—high capacity calls for large di-
mensions, hence the increase of both is possible only to a certain limit.
The purpose of this study is to show how far the American manu-
facturers of water turbines have come in this respect and to compare
the results, which were obtained by the various runner types. . The ac-
curacy of this study is naturally limited by the accuracy of the data,
which were accessible to the writer. These data are taken from the guar-
antees of the different concerns and as these guarantees are based on
careful tests made in the Holyoke testing flume, which are considered


official in this country, the following study will give practically reliable
information. The comparison at least will be accurate, because if mistakes
in the testing of the wheels be made (and some engineers especially in
Europe, believe that the Holyoke tests are not quite reliable) the same
mistakes would be made on all runners.
NOTATION.
To get a proper basis for this study some of the principal turbine
formulae must be recalled and some new ones derived. The notation
is the same, which the writer uses in his lectures on water turbines at
the University of Michigan.
H.P., = effective power of the runner.
n = speed of the runner in R. P. M.
Q = discharge of the runner in cubic feet per second.
H = net head in feet acting upon the turbine = gross head minus
all losses in head race, conduit and tail-race,
c = hydraulic efficiency of the turbine.
(i— c)H = head lost inside of turbine itself due to friction, whirls
and shocks.
Dj = mean entrance diameter of runner in feet.
b„ = height of guide case in feet.
aj= angle between entrance speed and peripheral speed at D .
f}1 = bucket angle at Dt.
c = real entrance speed at D,.
w, = relative entrance, speed at D .
v = peripheral speed at T) .
cr = radial entrance speed at D,.
= radial component of c , see Figs, i and 2.
SPEED.
All modern American runners are of the radial inward flow type
working with pressurehead. The definition of the "pressurehead turbine"
or "pressure turbine" (the so-called reaction turbine) is: "The water
enters the runner and flows through the same with a certain pressurehead,
—as the whole available head is not turned into speed at the entrance.
The real entrance speed Ci is smaller than the spouting velocity. A pres-
surehead is left to be used for the acceleration of the relative water stream
in the njnner."
The regulation of the hydrodynamic conditions in the runner for
a flow either with or without pressurehead is possible by a proper choice
of the angles ft and o,, or of the bucket and guidevane angle, as &amp;i is
practically the same as the guidevane angle &lt;v

Both fi and Vi are functions of the angles a, and /3i for a given head.

It would become equal to this velocity if

Or
if ft = 2a,
For all angles ft, which are larger then 20,, the speed o will be
smaller than the spouting velocity—hence the turbine will be a pressure
turbine.
For a prcssureless turbine the peripheral speed would be
3 COSd! v "'
This is variable only within very small limits, as cosa, varies only a little
for the values of at which are used in practice. Hence the peripheral
speed of the prcssureless turbine is practically given by the head, and the
speed » (R.P.M.) can be varied only by variation of the runner diam-
eter D\. As practical reasons will restrict both the increase and decrease
of Di, the speed of a pressureless turbine is variable only within narrow
limits. This is one of the main reasons why nowdays pressure turbines
occupy the first place, and pressureless turbines (Impulse wheels and
Schwamkrug-turbines) are used only when absolutely neecssary. The
speed of the pressure turbine can be varied not only by variation of the
runner diameter but also very effectively by variation of the angles ft
and a,. Combining both means it is easy to vary the speed of a pressure
turbine for a given head and capacity between the proportions of 6 : I.
To show how the angles o, and ft affect the peripheral speed v,
the factor
lain (ft — «t)
\ sin ft cos a,


of equation (2) has been represented by a series of curves. Figure 3
gives the values of this factor for a series of constant bucket angles ft
with variable angles Oi. Figure 4 gives the same values for a series
of constant angles at with variable angles ft.
For ft = 900 the factor
4
sin (ft — at)
sin ft cos »i
for all values of a,. The guide vane angle does not affect the speed of
the turbine. For all angles ft &lt; 900 the value of the radical is smaller
than 1; for all angles ft &gt; 900 its value is larger than I.
As for low and medium head turbines we shall have to make, as a
rule, the speed as high as possible, all American standard runners, being
low or medium head runners, have ft &gt; 900. Therefore we call these
types of runners "high speed runners." Runners with ft:=go° are called
medium speed runners (sometimes called German runner type). Run-
ners with ft &lt; 900 are called low speed runners. See Figures 5, 6. 7.
The "high speed runners" are frequently called "the American run-
ner type." Practical reasons, as for instance the necessity of an easy,
smooth and not too long curvature of the bucket, are limiting the increase
of ft. The value of ftm.x = 1350 will represent good practice and will be
found generally in the best American high speed runners. The increase
of angle at also increases the speed Vi for all angles ft &gt; 90°. But to avoid
what is called overgating it will be advisable to not assume too high
values for a,. Tests show that the capacity of the runner reaches its
maximum at a certain gate opening. To open more is not only useless,
but even wrong, as not only the output but also the efficiency goes down.
Though the point of overgating depends on the design of the runner,
and by its proper design (at the least passage area) this point may be
moved upwards, it is not advisable to depend too much on this. Less
efficiency than that expected does not disappo'nt the turbine buyer so
much as when the turbine is found to give less than the expected maxi-
mum power. It is not wise to make &lt;*i larger than 40°.
The hydraulic efficiency may be taken as from 0.82 . . . 0.84. For
4 = 0.83, V^g = 5.i67 and
*i = 5-167 J
sin (ft —ni) j/-jf

Since for a given runner the value of the radical is a constant we may
write
v&gt; = K,X^H (3)
and A", may be called the speed constant.

For Pi = 1350, ai = 4o°, 4 = 0.83, Kt = about 7.0. For given run-
ners where D\, H and n are known these speed constants can be cal-
culated as follows:
vi tt Din
Kt~ v~h~ t*&gt;v~rr (4)
and thus the different runner types can be compared as regards their
different speeds. These constants will also show, whether a further in-
crease of the speed is possible or not. Should the speed constant be
considerably larger than 7, then it can be assumed with certainty that
either the guaranteed speed is higher than the best speed (the best speed
is the speed at which the runner yields the maximum efficiency) or that
the nominal diameter of the runner is larger than the mean diameter Di.
CAPACITY.
The quantity of water discharging from a given opening in a cer-
tain time, say 1 sec, is Q = const. X VW, if H is the head at the center
of the opening. Hence Q/^H equals constant for a given opening. We
call this constant the "specific discharge" and use for the same the symbol:
Qx = -£=. cub. ft./sec. (5)
V"
The specific discharge from an orifice is the discharge in cub. feet
per sec. when H = / ft.
Take into consideration the entrance area of the runner.
/4, = *D,&amp;oX fc,
where A-,, being smaller than I, is a factor, the addition of which is neces-
sary in order to consider the decrease of the circumference by the ends
of vanes and buckets.
The speed of the stream normal to this entrance area is the radial
speed constant cr, which—like all speeds of a given runner—equals
cr = A, i/~H
Passage area X speed of flow normal to the area = discharge. There-
fore

Ki is the "capacity constant" of the runner. The capacity constant of a
runner is its specific discharge for a runner diameter = I ft.
For all runners of the same type Ki will be nearly the same hence
the capacity constant is a criterion of the capacity of different runner
types.
SPEED AND CAPACITY.
Knowing the speed and capacity constants of different runners and
runner types we are not yet able to say to what extent each of them
fulfills the requirements of highest speed with highest capacity.
We may have two runners with different values of Ki and Ki and
yet both runners may be equivalent, when we consider capacity and speed
together. Another criterion must be introduced, which will be a proper
combination of Ki and Kt. This combination could be made in various
ways but the most convenient one may be derived as follows:
ir D\ n ,
Vi ■ ~d~ = K« V h
6oK,i/H
* = Tl
KiD,*=Q,/.Dl = J^Vft
By substitution
60 K, x/7T 6o |/kT X K, Ijf
The power of a turbine is HP = *-*-—17; rf = efficiency of turbine.
55**
HP = KQH. As a rule y is taken = 80%, then K=i/ii.
Substituting for Q=HP/KH, and for Qx—HP/YiH^H.


In the last equation for n we get
_ 60 |/kTk, \/h~
V
60 y/lt; K. t/ Y y //^/Ty
\'HP
±_
n = K, X
K _ 60 i/kT K, i/~K~
(9)
Ki may be called the "Type constant" or "fy££ characteristic" of
the runner. It is a combination of the speed and capacity constant and
both determine the type of the runner. The convenience of this constant
will he apparent, when we write equation 8 in the following form:
nV HP
,-L (10)
H V H
Ki can be figured directly from the speed, power and head, which
data can be obtained easily and seldom differ from actual values. No
dimensions of the runner, neither the discharge nor the efficiency need
to be known and yet the efficiency is considered because the formula
contains K which is a function of -n.
Turbines of the same capacity and speed constant but with different
efficiency will have a different type characteristic. Hence K« is an abso-
lute criterion for turbines in reference to the aim, "highest speed and
highest capacity with best efficiency." The meaning of Kj can be found
by assuming HP=l and H — I, then K. = «g (R.P.M.).
"The type characteristic is the speed in R.P.M. of a turbine dimin-
ished in all dimensions to such an extent as to develop 1 HP. when work-
ing under the head H = / ft."

IMPROVE:!) NEW AMERICAN RUNNER


In Germany the term "specific speed" (spezifische Gescliwindigkeit
or spezifische Umlaufzahl) and the symbol nt is used for K3.
The writer prefers however not to use this term for the following
reasons. The word "specific" discharge is used for Qi = Q/^IH, the
word "specific" power is used for HP/HVH, or for the discharge and
power under the head H = 1 ft. Hence, "specific" speed should denote
the speed at H = 1 ft.
|/ H
As »i is used very frequently, the term type characteristic has been
chosen for KB.
SPEED, CAPACITY AND TYPE CHARACTERISTICS OK THE AMERICAN HIGH SPEED
RUNNERS.
I. THE DAYTON CI.OBE IRON WORKS CO., DAYTON, OHIO.
The Dayton Globe Iron Works Co. is the manufacturer of the
world known "American" turbines. The last two types arrived at by
this concern are the "New American" and the "Improved New Ameri-
can" turbine. The difference in the design of these two runners is seen
from figures No. 8, 9, 10, 11. In order to increase the capacity, the height
has been increased and the entrance edge inclined, thus the mean diam-
eter A has been reduced and speed increased, while the minimum pas-
sage area at a is kept ample. The discharge end of the bucket has also
been changed. In order to increase the actual discharge area and to so
decrease the discharge speed the bucket has been drawn down and ends
in a spoonlike outward discharge. The radius of the curvature of the
spoon however seems to be too small. The outward discharge could
be made more effective by a larger spoon. Nevertheless the capacity
and efficiency of this runner are very good.
The data for a 19" New American rHnner are:

In the same way the constants for the other runner sizes have
been calculated and are given in Table No. I. Also the "specific speed"
n „., ... :c „ „ HP
»i =
V H
and the specific power H Pi = have been added as
// V H


they are very convenient characteristics of a runner. They can be used
for finding the speed and power of each runner for any given head.
», = 339^25 = 67.8.
#Pi = 80/25 V25 =0.64.
[At H=3/6 this runner would have a speed 11 = 67.8X^36—406.8
R.P.M. and would develop o.64X36V36= 142.2 HP.]
The Improved New American runner figured in the same way
will be found to have a speed constant, which is considerably larger
than that one corresponding to ft = 135° and o, = 40°. As the speed n
(R.P.M.) must be assumed to be correct,—it is based on Holyoke tests—
and the angles ft and ii do not exceed 1350 and 40° respectively, (ft is
about 135°; o, seldom exceeds 350), the discrepancy can be due only
to the fact, that the nominal diameter is larger than the mean diameter
Di. Measuring several runners the writer has found that the nominal
diameter is taken close to the fillet—see Fig. No. n. The ratio of the
mean diameter and nominal diameter was found to be about 0.97 for
smaller diameters. Assuming the same ratio for all diameters it will be
found that for larger sizes the mean diameters must even be less 0.97
of the nominal diameter.

2. THE PLATT IRON WORKS CO., DAYTON, O., SUCCESSORS TO STIIXWELL
BIERCE CO.
To meet the demand for turbines for low, medium and high heads
this company is manufacturing different types of water turbines—both
radial inward flow and outward flow; pressure and pressureless turbines.
Here only the Victor turbine Type A for low and medium heads will
be taken into consideration. The name under which this turbine gen-
erally appears is "Cylinder Gate Victor Turbine" as this concern prefers
to equip their turbines with the cylinder gate regulating device. There
are two patterns of the Victor runner Type A. The Standard capacity
runner and the Increased capacity runner. Both have the same speed—
only the capacity varies.
One characteristic feature of the Victor runner is the large num-
ber of buckets. It seems to the writer however that there are no reasons
to make so many buckets either for strength or for efficiency—on the
contrary it is advisable to reduce the number of buckets of low head
runner in order to increase the capacity and avoid small widths of the
chutes at the runner hub. Tables III and IV have been calculated in
the same way as the preceding tables. The average values of the char-
acteristic constants are:

THE JAMES
LEFFEL AND CO.. SPRINGFIELD
» 0.
The James Leffel &amp; Co., manufactures the well known Double
wheel, designed first by James Leffel as a combination of two runners,—
one being a pure radial, the other a radial and downward discharge
runner. To increase he capacity of this runner one had to bulge it out
more and so the new Double wheel was brought out, which like all
high speed runners discharges centrally and outwardly. The special
feature of this "Improved Samson Wheel" is the partition wall, subdi-
viding the runner into two "stories." The upper half is a solid casting,
the lower half has steel plate buckets.
Although manufacturing reasons—such as the wish to use some
existing patterns or pattern parts—may have been prevailing, it is more
than doubtful whether the addition of the partition wall is an advantage.
Without going any further into this matter only a few reasons for this
opinion of the writer may be stated.
The partition wall increases the friction, decreases height and capac-
ity, increases possibility of clogging and if not built so that it coincides

with the water flow line, it decreases the capacity still more and also
the efficiency.
One advantage could be claimed, namely, that the regulation by
a cylinder gate will not affect the efficiency of the turbine very much,—
but this is the case only for small variation of load when the cylinder
gate closes the upper part of the runner.

The Trump Mfg. Co. is one of the best known turbine manufacturers,
especially abroad. At the time when European concerns were not willing
or prepared to build radial inward flow turbines or were only starting to do
so, hundreds of such wheels were installed by the Trump Mfg. Co. all
over the European continent. Like the Samson runner the Trump run-
ner has steel plate brackets and resembles in form the other American
runners.

RISDON ALCOTT TURBINE CO. MOUNT HOLLY, N. J.
The types of runners manufactured by the Risdon Alcott Turbine
Co. are very numerous, due to the fact that this concern is a fusion of
two turbine manufacturers, the T. H. Risdon Co. and the T. C. Alcott
&amp; Son. We shall consider here only the Alcott high duty special runner,
the Risdon dovlbe capacity runner, and the Leviathan runner.

From Table No. IX it appears that similar to the Improved New
American runners, the nominal diameters must be larger than the real
mean diameters of the runners. The values of he speed constant K;
seem to be too large,—and those of the caapcity constant too small for
the large values of K«.
The average values of the characteristic runner constants are:
Alcott High Duty Risdon
Special Double Capacity Leviathan
Capacity constant Ki 2.25 1.7 2.96 (?)
Capacity constant Kt 5.46 5.9 7.47 (?)
Type characteristic K» 46.7 43.8 74.1
The mean values for he Alcott high duty special runners have been
calculated from values of runner diameters up to 48". The runners 54",
60" and 66" diameter have a reduced capacity.

MORGAN SMITH CO., YORK, PA.
The Morgan Smith Co. manufactures the noted McCormick and
Netv Success turbines. Recently a new type has been put on the market
by this company under the name of the Smith turbine. This new run-
ner,—as it can be seen from Table No. XII, has attained somewhat higher
values for Ki than those of the Improved New American runner, which
was the leading runner in this respect until the Smith Turbine appeared.

THE WELLMAN-SEAVER-MORGAN COMPANY, CLEVELAND, OHIO.
The "Standard" runner manufactured by the Wellman-Seaver-Mor-
gan Co. is the Jolly McCormick runner. A table of the characteristics
and curves of this runner has been omitted, as they are exactly the same
as those of the McCormick runner, manufactured by the S. Morgan
Smith Co. See Table No. X, and curves, Fig. 24.
The Wcllman-Seaver-Morgan Co. manufactures also a "special" run-
ner with increased capacity and increased speed, judging from the test
of a 33" turbine. The values of the characteristic runner constants are:
Capacity constant Kt = 3.2.
Speed constant Ks = 6.49.
Type characteristics K. = 68.2.
Arranging now the various runner types according to their type
characteristics, we will have answered the question how far he different
concerns have come in reference to the aim of highest capacity and
highest speed with good ev/ciency. Table No. XIII gives both the mean
and the maximum values of Kj, which were reached by the various
runners and the corresponding capacity and speed constants Ki and K».

As European engineers and European text books frequently refer
to the American "high speed runners" and as it appears that the infor-
mation they have about the same is very inaccurate, the runner charac-
teristics have been given also in the metric system.
For I (ft.)= 0.30479 (m), 1 (cub. ft) = 0.028317 (cub. m.), 1 (HP)
= 1.01385 (cheval vapeur) = 1.01385 (metric HP).

For clearness two sets of curves have been drawn showing the
specific power and speed of the various runner types. In Fig. 26 the
curves of the Improved Samson and Trump runner have been omitted,
as they would interfere with those of other runners.
The curve of the Improved Samson runner—as can be seen from
the values of Id in Table V, would almost coincide with that of the
Victor Standard capacity runner. The curve of the Trump runner with
that of the Victor increased capacity. The curve of the Leviathan run-
ner has been drawn as dotted line—because the nominal diameter of this
runner type seem to be larger than the real mean diameters and a cor-
rection like with the Improved New American could not be made for
lack of information. Judging from the value of Ki the curve should be
in neighborhood of those for the Smith and Improved New American
runners.
For the same reasons, the speed curves of the Leviathan, Improved

At the end it may be emphasized that it was not the intention of
the writer to decide which runner type is best. To endeavor to answer
such a question would be absolutely wrong. There can not be a runner
which would be best for all conditions. In many cases the best efficiency
will be the deciding factor,—very frequently the variation of the efficiency
with the variation of load, sometimes the maximum capacity or the
maximum speed will determine which is the best runner for a given
case. Not seldom for merely technical reasons the "best" runner may be
one which for capacity, speed and efficiency occupies a minor position
among the other runners.


VACUUM PUMPS
BY JOHN C BIRD, 04-
Vacuum pumps and vacuum apparatus today constitute one of the
most important features of every up-to-date and efficient steam power
plant. The vacuum pump was one of the earliest developed auxilliaries
of the steam engine. In fact it was developed by James Watt, and though
altered in many ways by changes in details of construction, the principle
of operation was not improved on for over ioo years. Many pumps con-
structed like Watts' are in use today.
The earlier steam engines depended entirely on a vacuum apparatus
for their operation, and in the engines of Savery and Newcomen the
vacuum was produced by a jet of water in the working cylinder itself.
These machines were extremely crude, but served their purpose for over
fifty years, until Watt conceived the idea of separating the condenser
from the engine. This arrangement required a vacuum pump to handle
the air and the uncondensable vapors in the steam. The vacuum pump
of Watt was an adaptation of a water pump, being a vertical single' acting
pump with ;nlet valves in a stationary plate through which the water
and air entered the cylinder. Its dicharge valves were located on the
top of the air piston.
The first cut shows a sectional view of an engine and its condensing
apparatus. In this plant the vacuum pump is practically the same as
the pump of Watt. It is operated by a separate steam cylinder, while
Watt operated the air pump by power from the main engine. Both
systems are in use today, although the separate air pump is more in favor
because its speed can be regulated to suit the load on the engine,—and it
can be started up before starting the engine, thus draining out the water
from the engine and pipes in a more positive manner.
The pump commonly used in steam plants is shown in section in the
second cut. This pump is a horizontal double acting pump. The suction
valves are located on the lower valve plate just above the cylinder barrel,
and the discharge valves are located on another plate above. On the cut is
also shown the jet condenser in which the steam is condensed by a
conical spray of cold water which flows down into the suction chamber
of the pump and is continuously removed by the pump along with the
air and uncondensable vapors. This same design of pump is also used
in connection with surface condensers, and in connection with vacuum

pans in the manufacture of sugar and chemicals. This design is used
also in steam heating plants. Nearly every heating plant installed
in large buildings has its vacuum pump to maintain a slight vacuum on
the return pipes of the system and thus assist in the circulation of the
steam, thus permitting the use of exhaust steam without creating back
pressure on the engine.
Although pumps constructed on different principles are now widely
used, the two designs of "voluntary valve" pumps shown on the two cuts
were the only vacuum pumps in use in steam plants up to fifteen years ago.
The voluntary valve pump will produce a commercial vacuum of
from 24 in. to 26 in. referred to a barometric pressure of 30 inches.
It is limited as to the vacuum it will create by the fact that the air
and water must enter the cylinder through valves which must be lifted
by the entering water, and the vacuum that the pump can produce in


the condenser is less than that produced in the pump cylinder. The differ-
ence is due to the frictional resistance of the suction valves, which
depends on the weight of the valves and the tension of the springs. The
highest practical vacuum that can be obtained by the voluntary valve
vacuum pump is A\A to 27 inches, and this is not practical commercially
except in chemical plants and the like where the amount of air to be
handled is small. If any considerable quantity must be handled, 25 inches
is the practical limit because with a higher vacuum the size of the pump
must be increased greatly and the cost of operation in connection with a
steam plant is more than the value of the higher vacuum. The reason
is two-fold: in the first place the air occupies a larger volume per unit
weight at the higher vacuum than at the lower vacuum; also he air
expands on entering the vacuum cylinder on account of difference in pres-
sure between the condenser and the pump cylinder, and the higher the
vacuum the greater the ratio of expansion. Both these reasons require
a much larger pump for a high vacuum than for a lower vacuum in order
to handle the same amount of air.
With the advent of the steam turbine it became necessary to carry
higher vacuum to obtain the best economy the turbine is capable of
giving. This led to the introduction of two new forms of vacuum pumps.
The first was the dry air pump, originally a German invention but now
made in its best forms in America. This pump is a crank and flywheel
pump and is practically the reverse of a steam engine. Suction takes
place through ports opened and closed by a slide valve, thus offering no
resistance to the entering air. Discharge takes place through poppet valves.
The dry pump—as its name signifies—is intended to be used to
handle only air and vapor. If any quantity of water enters the cylinder
it will soon cause the valve face to cut, owing to the lubricant being
washed away from the valve seat. When a dry pump is used, a "wet
pump" or ordinary water pump is used to handle the water, or else the
condenser is arranged to drain itself through a 35 foot "tail pipe" with
its end submerged to prevent air from entering.
The air cylinder of the dry air pump is always water jacketed to
prevent heating due to the high range of compression; from 28" vac.
to the atmospheric pressure being a range of about 15 to 1.
In a dry vac. pump the clearance air would cause a very serious
decrease in capacity of the machine if it were not taken care of by a
special device which is an essential part of the dry air pump. At the
end of the stroke the slide valve closes the suction entirely and for an
instant the two ends of the cylinder are connected by a port in the slide
valve. This allows the clearance air contained within the port and other
clearance spaces to flash over into the other end of the cylinder in which
there is a high vacuum and which is not in connection with the suction


THE MICHIGAN TECH NIC
pipe. This arrangement reduces the pressure in the clearance spaces to
practically suction pressure at the beginning of the stroke, and the pump
can draw a cylinder full of air at each stroke, no capacity being lost
by re-expansion of clearance air.
The dry vac. pump is now being installed in practically all of the
larger steam power plants, being used with both turbines and reciprocating
engines. Its general range of vacuum in connection with steam plants
is from 26" to 28". The degree of vacuum carried, however, is not
usually dependent on the pump, but on the condenser, for a much larger
condenser must be provided for 28" than for 26" vacuum. As long as
the pump keeps the condenser reasonably free of air and uncondensable
vapors the degree of vac. obtainable depends entirely on the capacity of
condenser itself.
Many of the best equipped plants have two stage dry vacuum pumps
installed with the idea of carrying the highest possible degree of vac
The two stage pump will produce a higher degree of vac. because the
second stage protects the first stage from leakage and the range of pres-
sures through which each cylinder has to work is much less. A well de-
signed two stage vac. pump will produce on test 29.97 vac. referred to 30"
Bar., when handling only small quantities of vapor. In a steam plant,
however, the co_st and operation of a condenser large enough to handle
the steam at over 28" vac. is prohibitive, hence the two stage dry air pump
is usually no better than a single stage pump. The two stage dry air
pump is used to a considerable extent by incandescent lamp manufacturers,
and it is in this kind of work that it shows its real value, for the quantity
of air to be handled is small and the pump is used to create a very high
degree of vacuum.
Another type of pump designed to meet the needs of a h:gher vacuum
than that given by the voluntary valve pump is the "suction valveless
pump." This idea has been worked out in a variety of designs both
vertical and horizontal, but all are alike in the principle that suction takes
place through an open port in the cylinder barrel, which is uncovered by
the piston during the latter part of its stroke. Discharge takes place
through ordinary poppet valves. These suction valveless pumps usually
remove water of condensation as well as the air. They are mostly direct
steam driven pumps without fly-wheel, and are designed for use where
a high degree of vac. is required but where efficiency is not so important
as to warrant the greater cost of a dry pump and a separate wet pump
to handle water of condensation alone.
The use of vacuum pumps is increasing as steam engine plants are
looking toward higher economy even in the smaller units, and as long
as steam is used as a motive power the vacuum pump will be an indis-
pensable part of an efficient power plant.


DEEP BUILDING FOUNDATIONS IN CHICAGO
Bv James N. Hatch, '92, M. Am. Soc., C. E.
In an article by the writer on "Chicago Foundations," published in
the Architects' and Builders' Magazine for September, 1904, he gave an
account of the trials and tribulations which have been experienced in
Chicago, in designing foundations for heavy buildings. In that article
he expressed the belief that the floating foundations which had previously
been so generally used, would be replaced in the future by more sub-
stantial foundations and that the floating foundations were a thing of
the past. During the four years that have intervened since that article
was published, the prediction has held good, and there is every indication
that it will hold good as long as great buildings of the so-called sky-
scraper type are constructed.
During the past six or seven years, all of the great buildings six-
teen to twenty stories high, which have been constructed, have had
either so-called caisson foundations or pile foundations, and now that
most of the newer buildings have two or three sub-basements, with the
floor of the lowest one on a level with the Chicago tunnels, the caisson
type of foundations has come more and more into prominence. But
with this deep excavation, reaching to a depth of forty or fifty feet below
the sidewalk there have arisen some very interesting problems which the
building engineers have had to cast about vigorously for some method
of solving. It is the purpose of this article to give some of the details
of how this deep foundation work is carried out and to illustrate some
of the subterraneous portions of a tall steel frame building such as form
so prominent a part of the modern great city.
As is quite generally known, Chicago has a very extensive system
of freight tunnels or subways, underlying almost every street in the
business portion of the city. The floor of these tunnels is about forty-
five or fifty feet below the sidewalk level, and as said, the modern great
buildings are constructed so that the lowest basement floor is on a level
with the floor of these tunnels. The power plant for the building is
generally placed on this level, and the remaining portion of this base-
ment floor is sometimes used as a freight receiving depot and switching
yard for the tunnel cars. The coal can be brought in and the ashes taken
out upon these tunnel cars, and all work incident to the power plant
carried out, without any evidences of this work being manifested at the
street level.


As is always the case in Chicago, a portion of the problem of con-
structing a new building consists in the demolition of the old building
occupying the site, and the removal of the old material to some distant
place of disposal. If this is a seven or eight story building as is often
the case, this portion of the problem is one of no small consideration
apart from the construction of the new building, especially in that por-
tion of the city where the street traffic is very congested.
As will be inferred, these older buildings have their footings rest-
ing on the earth but a small distance below grade, and as the excavation
for the new building is to go about fifty feet below grade, the greatest
precaution must be taken or the adjacent old buildings will settle un-
evenly and the walls and floors crack so badly as to render the buildings
unsafe. In some cases where the necessary precautions were not taken,
some of these adjacent buildings have settled over a foot and so unevenly
as to crack the walls until it was necessary to tie them together with
rods to keep the building from going to pieces. There have also been
settlements of a foot or so in street levels and car tracks, and some
bad settlements in the Elevated Railway structure. As this has led to
much damage and litigation, the modern builder takes the utmost pre-
caution to prevent settlement in adjacent property.
The construction work outlined in this article will comprise the de-
molition of a seven story brick building and the placing of the founda-
tions and a portion of the steel work for a sixteen story steel frame
building. There is also an old party wall forming part of another old
brick building, just adjacent, which must not be disturbed. As no ar-
rangement could be effected for a new party wall and no encroachment
would be allowed by the adjacent building owner, it became necessary
to do all excavation within the property lines of the new building prop-
erty. This necessitated the use of cantilever girders to carry the columns
next to the old party wall, as shown. A further requirement that was
imposed upon the building engineer was that the occupants of the building
be not disturbed until the foundations of the new building were practi-
cally completed, which meant that most of the foundation work described
herein had to be carried on beneath the old building in such a manner
that the tenants were scarcely aware of the fact that any such work was
going on beneath them.
Figure i shows a cross section of the old building with the
excavation just started for the retaining wall, which was necessary to
protect the old party wall. This first excavation is carried on with the
greatest care to obviate any possibility of settlement in the old building
footings of the adjacent building. To insure there being no settlement
a trench is excavated the sides of which are kept shored up with wood


riBgEE3Sft3L.Vl


planking placed on edge horizontally and held apart by jack screws.
These jack screws and plank are placed in the trench as the excavation
progresses, so that there will never be more than a few feet of earth
wall unprotected, and this wall will never remain unprotected for any
length of time. These jack screws are turned up hard so as to prevent
any movement of earth behind the planking.
The soil underlying Chicago being a very tough impervious clay,
very little water will seep in between these plank, and unless a pocket
of quicksand is encountered there is usually very little trouble experienced
in extending these trenches down to any desired depth. In Figures 2 and
3 this trench is shown excavated to a depth such that there is no possi-
bility of the surface earth settling below the proposed depth of the base-
ment excavation. When this has been accomplished the planking and
jack screws form an effective barrier between the interior and the exterior
of the new building, and any work of excavation inside this wall will
not affect the surrounding earth. As soon as this trench is completed the
excavation for the caissons or piers can be carried on. In the case under
consideration, the caissons for the new building were placed directly under
the columns of the old building, so that it was necessary to cut off the
columns of the old building before the wells could be dug. Figure 2
shows in detail the underpinning for the old building columns and illus-
trates how the wells were excavated. A protected trench for a retaining
wall will also have been constructed at each end of the building as indi-
cated in the plan view of Figure 6 and a similar one along the street
front on the curb line. It is not usual to put down the last named trench,
however, until after the caissons are completed and the tenants have
moved out of the building, but this is not a fixed rule and will depend
on conditions. In the particular case under consideration the excavation
on the curb line was not commenced until after the wrecking of the old
building had been started.
Since the operation of a general freight service in the Chicago tun-
nels was started, the excavated material from most of the large buildings
is now hauled away upon these tunnel cars, and there is very little evi-
dence at the street level that any such work is being carried on. Previously
the earth was hoisted up through the sidewalk and hauled away in wagons.
With the present system, the earth ladened cars run down to Michigan
Aveune and Congress Street and there come to the surface and are drawn
by small steam locomotives out to the lake front and there the earth is
thereby get rid of the dirt and the city has got an enormous amount of
filling done, practically free of charge. One of the views shows a section
deposited, for filling, in the new Lake Front Park which is being made
just to the east of the business portion of the city. The tunnel people


thereby get rid of the dirt and the city has got an enormous amount of
filling done, practically free of charge. One of the views shows a section
through one of these tunnels and a temporary chute through which the
materials are dumped down to the tunnel level, where they may be loaded
upon the tunnel cars.
Now to return to the work of excavation, the wells which are shown
are dug down to a depth of about ioo feet below the sidewalk level. It
has never been found necessary to use air pressure in this sort of excava-
tion, except in a few special cases, in the business section of Chicago, as
the clay becomes dryer the deeper the excavation is carried. The use
of lagging in sections about six feet long is all that is necessary to hold
the earth back. When a section six feet deep has been completed this
lagging, which is made of matched lumber about 3" x 6" resembling tank
staves, is set in a circle against the wall of this well and two iron hoops
are placed on the inside of this lagging and fastened and wedged in so
as to press the lagging hard against the sides of the well; the excavation
is then carried on for another six feet.
The softer clay is handled with a four tined fork and the harder
variety with pick and shovel. The dirt is hoisted out of the wells in
buckets with a rope wound over a windlass, and may be hoisted by power
or by hand as the case may be. Some of the contractors have a system by
which a dozen of these windlasses are driven by a rope drive from a
single hoisting engine. The earth is dumped from these buckets down
the chute to the tunnel track and thence loaded upon the tunnel cars.
The accompanying pictures show the various stages of progress from
the time that excavation is started in the basement of the old building
till the steelwork of the new building is completed. In Figure 2 the dig-
ging of the wells is illustrated with the columns cut off and underpinned.
Instead of columns, some of the older buildings have brick piers, which are
similarly cut off and underpinned. The front wall was also underpinned
sufficiently to permit of the sinking of the wells beneath this wall as shown
in Figure 3.
As soon as all the wells were completed and had been filled with
concrete up to a foot or so below the level of the proposed lowest base-
ment floor line, the column bases were set ready to receive the new steel
columns. The old building was then abandoned and the work of demoli-
tion begun. A hole was cut through all of the floors of this old building
and a timber chute made through which the refuse was delivered into
the basement, where it was dumped into the tunnel chute and hauled away
in the tunnel cars. The valuable salvage was hauled away on wagons or
otherwise utilized. The work of demolition was commenced at the roof
of the building and the removing of the old building was accomplished
in a few days.


While the work of excavation was going on, the steelwork for the
new building was being fabricated at the shops, and was all ready to set
in place as soon as the old building was out of the way. Therefore when
the old debris had been cleared away from the site, a traveler or derrick
was placed in a convenient position for setting the steel columns. These
columns are set down in the wells and the first Basement Floor beams are
set and braced in every direction, so as to support the retaining walls
across the building. That is to say, that the great pressure of earth
against these concrete walls fifty feet high, is transmitted entirely across
the building by the floor steel, and is in this way balanced the one wall
against the other. Reference to Figure 6 will show this arrangement,
where the First Basement Floor is shown. As the excavation is continued
each subsequent Basement Floor is arranged in a similar manner, so
that the retaining wall never has an unsupported height greater than
the distance between basement floors.
As soon as the First Basement floor beams are completely set, the
lower sections of the columns having been subsequently erected, the con-
struction of the building begins at this point and proceeds both upward
and downward. As fast as enough excavation is completed the successive
basement floor beams are put in and braced against the retaining walls.
At the same time the steel work is being carried forward upon the upper
portion of the building. Very often as soon as seven or eight stories of
the steel frame are erected and riveted, the walls and floors are com-
menced and this branch of the work made to follow quite closely behind
the steel work; so that by the time the steel frame is completed and the
excavation done, it is often the case that five or six of the stories of the
building are practically completed, and the brickworkers and plasterers
are working both upward and downward from the ground line. In some
cases which the writer has in mind, the first two or three floors of the
building were occupied before the excavation was finished or the top of
the building completed.
The retaining walls which extend entirely around the building are
made of concrete reinforced with 15" vertical beams spaced three or four
feet apart. At each floor level a horizontal girder is framed in between
the columns for supporting these vertical beams and transmitting their
reaction into the floor system. The vertical beams are used in as long
lengths as can be conveniently handled. It will be realized that near the
bottom of the excavation the earth pressure from the outside earth may
be very great, and it is therefore necessary to use very heavy beams to
take care of this pressure. In the lower basement floor it is usual to use
a system of reinforced concrete beams to withstand the pressure.
When the excavation is completed to the level of the tunnel floor,


a permanent sidetrack from the tunnel railway is put into the basement
and thereafter the debris can be loaded into these cars in the basement
and thus carried away. The excavation is sometimes made over a small
section of the building to the tunnel level at the very beginning of the
work. This permits the sidetrack from the tunnel to be brought into
the building, and allows the remaining dirt to be loaded upon these cars
in the basement. Quite an elaborate system of tracks can thus be laid
in the basement and these tracks can be shifted about and run up quite
steep grades so as to make the work of loading the earth very easy. On
as small a building as the one shown here, this would not be worth while,
but in very large buildings considerable advantage can be gained in this
way. Much of the building materials, machinery, piping, etc., can also
be brought into the building upon the tunnel cars, saving the congestion
on the street incident to handling and lowering such materials.
As the level of the lower basement floor is far below the sewers,
a special device must be arranged in each building to take care of the
drainage and waste water from the building. There is also some seepage
from the outside through the concrete, for the lake level gives a hydraulic
head of over thirty feet, and water will be forced in through every small
crevice or crack that may exist. To provide for this drainage a large
sump or ejector pit is placed near the center of the building, about ten
feet below the lowest portion of the lowest floor, to which all the sewage
from the building is conducted. To this pit there are also drains from
the walls and from floor basins so that all water which collects at this
floor level will drain into this pit. This pit is equipped with a large
automatic ejector which lifts the sewage up into the city sewers. This
ejector is operated by an electric motor and is arranged with a float so
that when the level of the water in the pit has reached a certain point,
a float throws a switch which starts the motor driven pump. The pump
operates until the pit is practically empty when it stops automatically
until the pit has filled again.
It will be readily understood that the subterraneous work incident
to the construction of such a building as has been considered above will
be an expensive undertaking, but an unsafe foundation is expensive at
any price, and the extra expense involved in rendering the building safe
is justified, and is in fact not a large percentage of the whole cost of such
a building. As a partial compensation for this extra cost there is obtained
the three or four additonal floors below the sidewalk, which are almost
as valuable for space as any floors in the building.
Some designing engineers consider the foundations perfectly safe
when the wells are dug to hardpan only, about seventy or eighty feet
below the sidewalk grade, while others believe it is not expedient to stop


Ct


short of bed-rock, which is found at about one hundred to one hundred
and twenty feet below grade. The foundations in the foregoing buildings
were carried to bed-rock, as are foundations for a number of the larger
buildings in Chicago. With such foundations there need be very little
apprehension no matter what may be done in the way of passenger sub-
ways, the agitation for which is beginning to gain headway.
It is hoped that this description and the accompanying illustration
will enable the reader to gain a good general idea of the class of founda-
tion work herein described. No attempt has been made to go into much
detail, and the illustrations are not at all complete, but enough has been
shown to illustrate the general features of the work. Each building con-
stitutes a study by itself and no two pieces of work will admit of the
same treatment, but in starting any piece of difficult work it is a great
help to one to have before him descriptions of similar work, which will
serve as guide posts by which he is able to discover a proper solution for
the problem in hand.


REINFORCED CONCRETE BEAM FORMULAE
By A. E. Lindau, 'oo.
Unnecessary confusion exists in connection with formulae for resist-
ing moments of reinforced concrete beams. This is a necessary result of
conditions that existed during the early development of the art.
The rules or formula; depended so largely on arbitrary constants
or assumptions as to be practically empirical—the rules being largely in
the hands of specialists who seemed to differ widely in the assumption of
stresses on which their rules were founded, the various formulae became
associated with the names of their authors to such an extent as to become
inseparably connected with their methods and practice. Methods and prac-
tice gradually developed into the so-called "systems"—a rather unfortunate
designation in some cases.
Since each "system" endowed itself with particular advantages and
enough mystery to be impressive, the idea was fostered that the formulae
must be fundamentally different. While the analysis of flexure in rein-
forced concrete beams has now been placed on a comparatively firm
foundation, new formulae are continually being proposed, but most of
them embody only some slight change in form or assumption, if they
are fortunate enough to be constructed on the ordinary laws of mechanics.
The number of more or less arbitrary factors that enter into the
construction of these formulae has given opportunity for infinite variation
in form and results, and the comparisons that have been made have, as
a rule, failed to place them on a common basis.
It can be shown that if definite stress in the steel and a particular
percentage of reinforcement be assumed, that all properly constructed
formulae will give practically the same results. The form of the stress
strain curve and the initial modulus of elasticity of concrete are within
the limits of working stresses immaterial.
Neglecting the tensile strength of the concrete, the resisting moment
is equal to the force in tension and the distance from the center of the
reinforcement to the center of gravity of the comperssion area,—calling
F this force and de the lever arm, we have—
(i) = Fxde. F = f„xpbd.
fs = stress in steel.
p = percentage of reinforcement.
b = width of section.
d = distance of reinforcement from top of beam.


F is a constant after the stress in steel and amount of reinforce-
ment has been decided upon—de varies with the ratio of the moduli, per-
centage of reinforcement and stress in steel, consequently the effect of
all these variables can be shown in the variation of this quantity.
Figs. I, 2 and 3 show graphically the manner in which de varies.
Ordinates give de in terms of the total depth of beam, stress in steel as
abscissae. Three curves are shown for constant stress per square inch
in the concrete and three straight lines for constant percentage of steel.
*The variation due to change in concrete modulus is shown by comparing
the three sets of curves for N = E,/E&lt;- = 10, 12 and 15.
The computation for de are based on the formulae set forth in the
1906 edition of the Corrugated Bar Company's cataolgue, which may be
taken as representative of the parabolic formulae.
The following formula; are cited to show the values of the effective
depth d, for various assumptions.
Making the notation common,
M r = Resisting Moment.
■y,=: distance neutral axis to top of beam.
d = distance from reinforcement top of beam.

p = percentage of reinforcement.
f, = stress in concrete.
f.- = stress in steel.
Ritter's Formula:
Mr = 1 /6xfebd* for finding size of beam.
Mr = pbdfs [S/6d — B] for finding amount of steel.
With our notation B is zero and pbdf9 = F, consequently de == 5/6xd
or.83d.
Hennebique's formula is so badly constructed that de has a very wide
range, but with .75% reinforcement is approximately ,8ad.
Considerc's Formula:
Mr=i/6xbd1![tx(4—x)+2fsp(x-3u+a)].
xd = distance from bottom of beam to neutral axis.
ud = distance from bottom of beam to reinforcement.
f, = 22750 p=.oi de=.86d
f„ = 22750 p=.02 d, = .83d
f, = 42600 p=.oi d, = .87d
fg= 42600 p=.r&gt;2 de=.84d
Wason's Formula:
Mr = 5/('.xFsd, which ia the same as Ritter's formula.
de = 5/6xdor .83d.


Capt. Sewell's Formula:
Mr = f.pbd(i-a/53ty,)
yi = _J_Np±^_L
Np(i+^-Np)
Since Capt. Sewell assumes a definite form for
his stress strain curre
for all values of stress in
the concrete,
there is
no change for d9 for
increasing stress in the steel.

Assuming 20,000 pounds per square inch in the steel and 1% rein-
forcement, the quantity de varies from .83d to .87d except in Mr. Thatch-
er's formula, a variation of less than 5%.
Referring to the curves it is shown that even for such wide varia-
tion as 10,000 to 50,000 pounds per square inch in the steel and JA to 2%
in the reinforcement, de varies only between .8d and .g2d. In view of this
there seems to be little ground for alarm at the apparent lack of agree-
ment between the various beam formulae.


THE INDUCTION MOTOR—ITS CHARACTERISTICS
IN THEIR RELATION TO INDUSTRIAL
APPLICATION
By A. M. Dudley, E. E., '02.
In discussing the application of any type of electric motor to a
given service, it should be borne in mind that there are several questions
of broader engineering scope, which must have been carefully consid-
ered first. The broadest is the relative advantage of electric drive over
other forms of power, both in general, and as modified by peculiar local
conditions. Next is the particular form in which the current shall be
used; that is, whether direct or alternating.
In the present case, it is assumed that for the good reasons of
adaptability, convenience and economy, electric drive is to be installed
and is to be applied by means of induction motors.
There arise at once two questions in the analysis, one qualitative
and one quantitative—first; what type of induction motor shall be em-
polyed; second, what shall be the capacity of the units for performing
the different operations?
It is customary to spend considerably more time in working out
the second of these questions than the first. Necessarily each unit, in
working under every day conditions, must be loaded to somewhere near
the normal capacity for which it was designed. A load too much in
excess of this causes ultimate damage or breakdown of the apparatus,
while a load considerably under the normal means that the motor is
operating with a performance, both as regards efficiency and power-factor,
below that for which it was designed. In this connection, there is a gen-
eral feeling that it is a common error for the user to install units of too
small capacity, from a mistaken idea of economy in reducing the first
cost. This feeling is not justified by general experience, for the number
of users suffering from a poor power-factor on account of underloaded
motors is quite as great as those who have occasional burn-outs. It is
but natural that, in the absence of complete data on the amount of
power required for the various processes of different industries, a motor
is occasionally overloaded, or a load is over-motored. These quantitative
difficulties are soon discovered and, in general, easily remedied. If, hew-
ever, the characteristics of the motor as regards speed and torque are
nearly but not quite what they should be, it may discharge its function

indifferently for some time and in the end be pronounced unsatisfactory
because of the greater difficulty in analyzing these qualitative elements.
"I had a direct-current motor of half the capacity doing this work for
years and doing it better," and "My little 25 horse-power steam engine
will pull your 50 horse-power motor off its feet," are complaints which
the manufacturer of induction motors meets often and meets successfully
by a little elementary knowledge of his motor characteristics, together

with some experience in the work performed. It is the province of the
designer to calculate a motor for a particular purpose, when the facts
of the cycle of operation are presented to him, and the solution of the
problem presents no greater difficulty than is usually found in reducing
theory to practice. However, when a certain line of motors is once laid
out with definite characteristics, it should be possible to take their cre-
dentials in the shape of performance curves, and so decide on their eligi-
bility to perform the work desired.
A short description is here given of the curves usually made out
to show the performance of the different types, followed by a list of
typical applications, with some comments from experience with several
that have been particularly interesting or troublesome.


63
For convenience in consideration, induction motors are first divided
according to the structure of the winding in the secondary, into two
classes; first, squirrel cage; second, phase-wound. These are again di-
vided into constant speed motors; and variable speed motors. These
divisions are made on the basis of the difference in speed-torque char-
acteristics, which is in general the determining feature. Before exam-
ining speed-torque curves, there are certain other curves common to all
types which should be considered:—
I-No-Load, Running Saturation, or Excitation Curves.—These
curves are obtained by running the motor light, that is, entirely free and
under no load. If it is a wound secondary, it is run with the secondary
short-circuited. The voltage is then varied over a wide range from
thirty or forty per cent over-voltage down to the lowest voltage at which
the machine will continue to run. The ampere and watt input is read
for a number of voltages and plotted in form of curves as shown in Fig. 1.
Fig. 2
The facts concerning the operation of the motor to be noted from
these curves are:—
First: Magnetizing or no-load, wattless current for the air-gap
alone (given by the ordinate AB at normal voltage to the tangent drawn
from the origin to the ampere curve).
Second: Magnetizing current for air-gap plus iron, or AC.
Third: AC-f-AB or saturation factor which indicates the degree
of saturation to which the iron is worked.
Fourth: Friction and windage loss—AB.
Fifth: Iron loss, ED. The sum of these two losses is called the
constant losses of the machine as they remain practically the same for
all loads, from no-load to fifty per cent over-load in distinction from the
primary or secondary copper losses, which vary as a function of the load.
These curves are useful in giving an idea of the power-factor and effi-
ciency of the machine at different loads. The magnetizing current is the
largest component of the wattless current and hence materially affects
the power-factor.
The wattless and working current under normal full-load may be
represented as two sides of a right triangle (Fig. 2) from which, directly,


the full-load power-factor is AO -=- AB. As the magnetizing current is
constant at all loads and the leakage current varies as a function of
the load, it can readily be seen that the magnetizing current affects the
power-factor most at light loads, which is another way of saying that a
motor with relatively large magnetizing current and small leakage current
will have a poor power-factor at light loads; or, vice versa, a motor with
small magnetizing current and large leakage current will have a good
power-factor at light loads. It may also be said, without material error,
that large magnetizing current goes with high maximum torque and large
leakage current with low maximum torque, which gives again the deduc-
tion that a motor which has a high maximum torque will have a poor
power-factor at light loads or, conversely, if a good power-factor at light
loads is required, it will probably be at the sacrifice of torque.
Locked Saturation or Stationary Impedance Curves.—These curves
are taken with the motor locked or held at a stand still. As in the case
of the no-load running curves the voltage is varied over a considerable
range and the watt and ampere input read. It is also customary to put
on a brake and read the mechanical torque exerted by the motor. These
curves are shown in Fig. 3. As the current at full voltage with the sec-
ondary stationary would be excessive, it is customary to take a number
of readings at convenient voltages and exterpolate the higher points, re-
membering that the ampere curve approximates a straight line very close-
ly and the watt and torque curves vary nearly as the square of the volt-
age. These curves give directly the impedance of the motor and the
starting torque at a given voltage; also the current required at start for
a given torque. From the watt readings and knowing the resistance of
the primary winding it is possible to figure out the resistance of the
secondary in terms of the primary.
3. Power or Brake Curves. From the no-load and locked readings
of current and watts at normal voltage in combination with the primary
resistance, there may be plotted, by means of the Heyland diagram or a
similar graphical method the efficiency, power-factor and speed torque
curves, for any and all loads on the motor, as in Fig. 4. These curves
can also be obtained by brake test, reading the speed, torque, current,
and watt input at normal voltage /or several loads. They are most in-
teresting as they tell the complete story of a motor's behavior, with the
exception of temperature. After a little familiarity with curves of this
nature it becomes possible to read a number of secondary facts which are
of considerable interest and assistance in predicting the success or fail-
ure of an application. For example, as pointed out above, if the power-
factor curve comes up abruptly and bends sharply as at A, the wattless
current at light loads is of relatively less importance than at greater

loads. Hence the magnetizing current is relatively small compared to
the leakage current. This explains the high power-factor at light loads
and is a fair prediction that the maximum torque is not excessive. Again,
the square shoulder on the efficiency curve indicates low fixed losses as
compared to the variable losses. In this connection, it is interesting to
note that maximum efficiency occurs at J4 load. This is usually the case
in well-designed constant speed motors of moderate capacities and indi-
cates in the design a balance or distribution of the losses to secure the
best results in the combination of performance and temperature. The
ordinate at any torque to the brake horse-power curve divided by the
ordinate to the real horse-power curve is the efficiency at that torque,
and the ordinate to the real horse-power curve divided by the ordinate
to the apparent horse-power is the power-factor for that torque. Also
by the common formula H.P. = Torque X r.p.m. -=- 5250, the horse-power
for any torque such as X is torque x times speed Y at the same torque
-f- 5250, or Z. The foregoing curves are common to all types of motors
and are used for reference on the points not covered by speed torque
curves.
4. Speed Torque Curves. In the application of power by means
of rotary motion, there are two essential considerations, namely, the
torque required, and the speed at which this torque must be developed.
There are applications, fairly represented by large rotary printing presses
or rolls for calendaring paper, where almost a constant torque is required
over a wide range of speed. Another class represented by some machine
tools, such as lathes, planers and boring mills, require nearly a constant
horse-power—i. c., the torque increases as the speed decreases . Again,
a constant head centrifugal pump motor is called upon to deliver a con-
stant torque at a constant speed. For this reason the characteristic curve
which has the most bearing on the application of motors is the speed-
torque curve or curves. From this point of view induction motors are
divided into four classes, viz: motors with squirrel cage secondary wind-
ings for constant speed service; motors with squirrel cage secondary
winding for variable'speed service; motors with phase-wound secondary
for constant speed service, and motors with phase-wound secondary for
variable speed service. The speed torque curve given in Fig. 4 is charac-
teristic of motors of the first class. Primarily, it is to be noted that
the drop in speed from no-load to full-load, or the slip, represented by
M Y is small. This is described by saying that the motor has good speed
regulation, or runs at nearly constant speed, from no-load to fifty per
cent over-load. Also the starting torque at full voltage or O B, in this
type is considerably less than the maximum torque OC. In order to have
this motor develop full-load torque or OX at the start it would be neces-


67
sary, by means of an auto-transformer or compensator, to apply a re-
duced voltage to the motor in the proportion (per cent of normal voltage
applied)*: (Normal voltage)':: OX: OB. When a motor of this type,
designed with good starting characteristics is deveolping full-load torque
at starting, the primary of the auto-transformer, to which it is connected,
will be drawing about three times full-load current from the line. If, how-
ever, full voltage be applied directly to the motor and the starting torque
OB is one and one-half times normal full-load torque, the motor will draw
3XiJ4 or 4$4 times full-load current from the line. The effect of low-
ering the resistance in the squirrel cage winding either by increasing the
section of the short-circuiting rings at the ends of the bars or by making

this ring from a material of lower resistance, would be to decrease the
slip or make the point Y move towards M, decrease the starting torque
at full voltage or cause B to move toward O, and increase the speed at
which maximum torque occurs, 1. e., cause E to move toward D. All that
is said later as to the effect upon the speed-torque curve of changing the
resistance in the secondary circuit of a phase-wound rotor is in degree
applicable to a change made in the resistance of a squirrel cage winding.
In motors of the second-class the speed variation is obtained by
varying the voltage applied to the motor terminals. This is accomplished
by means of an auto-transformer with a number of taps on the wind-
ings and a suitable controller for applying the different voltages to the
motor. The various speed-torque curves for different voltages and also
the corresponding current-torque curves are shown in Fig. 5. It will be
noted that the secondary resistance has been so chosen that maximum
torque occurs at starting, or, referring again to Fig. 4, the point E has


dropped to C, becoming one with B. This is done for the reason that
these motors are, for the most part, used for crane or elevator service
or for opening and closing valves, etc., and maximum torque is required
at start. The advantages of this type over the variable speed, phase-
wound rotor with external resistance are: simpler rotor construction
and simplicity in wiring when used in crane work,—that is to say, when
the motor is used on the bridge or trolley of a crane it is necessary to
run but three trolley wires as against a minimum of five for the phase-
wound rotor. The phase-wound rotor has three advantages, however, viz:
heat is taken away from the motor and dissipated in external resistance;
the controller is more serviceable for the reason that the controller in the
squirrel cage motor has to break the circuit in stepping from one voltage to
another while in the case of the motor with external resistance the control-
ler merely short-circuits the resistance steps and the burning is much less
on the controller fingers; the motor is quieter in starting, which is a
material consideration in the case of elevators in hotels and apartment
houses. The process of starting up notch by notch on the controller and
moving from one speed curve to the next is practically the same as for
the phase-wound rotor and is described in the next class.
The speed-torque curves of the third and fourth class motors may
be described together as they are practically the same, the difference
being that the constant speed motor runs with the resistance in the sec-
ondary short-circuited the greater part of the time, using the resistance
notch in starting only, for the purpose of securing a high starting torque
with a moderate current demand from the line. On the other hand, the
variable speed motor runs with more or less resistance in circuit, de-
pending on the cycle of operations and the speed desired. With a
motor of this type, by properly proportioning the resistance in the rotor
circuit, it is possible to obtain full-load torque at starting with very little
more than full load current, perhaps 1.2 times, as against three times
pointed out in the case of the constant speed squirrel cage motor. As in
the analogous case of a direct-current shunt wound motor with armature
resistance control, it should be possible, in the case of the phase-wound
secondary induction motor with resistance control, to secure full-load
torque at start with full load current, but as a matter of fact a little
more is required for the reason that there are some secondary losses
in an induction motor at stand still which are not present when it is up to
speed.
The efficiency, power-factor, and current curves, also the speed
torque curves for different amounts of resistance of a motor with wound
secondary are shown in Fig. 5. The torque is plotted on the horizontal
axis and the other quantities against this on the vertical ax-s. The


curves marked "first notch" to "sixth notch" are speed-torque curves
taken for different resistances and the curve marked "secondary short-
circuited" is the full speed curve with all resistance cut out of the sec-
ondary circuit. It should be noted in this type of motor that the power-
factor and current are always the same for a given torque, regardless
of the speed at which this torque is developed. For example, if the
Fig. 6
motor is developing 400 lbs. torque, the current required will be 7" or
130 amperes (Fig. 6), and the power-factor will be V or 91.5 per cent
whether the motor be running at 100 r.p.m. on the 2nd notch, 350 r.p.m.
on the 3rd notch, 490 r.p.m. on the 4th notch, 570 r.p.m. on the 5th
notch, 625 r.p.m. on the 6th notch, or 700 r.p.m. on the chort-circuited
curve. This fact, that the current and power-factor are the same for a
given torque at any speed, is a very characteristic one for this type of
motor and should always be borne in mind. The efficiency, on the other
hand, for a given torque varies widely with the speed; as is explained


later. The operation of starting up a motor of this type is as follows:
Suppose the start is to be made against a torque of 400 lbs. The con-
troller is thrown to the first notch, putting the full line voltage on the
primary terminals of the motor and inserting such an amount of resist-
ance in the secondary circuit that a torque "N" is developed and a cur-
rent N' drawn from the line. As this torque is less than 400 lbs., the
motor does not start. The controller is moved to notch 2, giving a torque
Z and drawing a current Z' from the line. This torque is slightly in
excess of the 400 lbs. required but owing to the fact that the friction of
rest is greater than the running friction, the chances are that the margin
is still too small and there is no start. When the controller is put on notch
3, a torque C is developed and a current C drawn from the line. The
motor starts and accelerates up the curve marked "3rd notch," until
the point d, or 350 r.p.m. is reached. Here the torque is just equal to
the 400 lbs. required, the current having fallen during the acceleration
from C to 7". The stable condition is at 400 lbs. and the motor runs
at 350 r.p.m. until the controller is thrown to the 4th notch, when a torque
B is developed and the motor again accelerates along the curve marked
"4th notch," until the point F, or 490 r.p.m. is reached, the current hav-
ing increased from V to B' and fallen again to V in the process. Sim-
ilarly, the controller is thrown to the 5th notch and the motor accelerates
from G to H; to the 6th notch, accelerating from / to /; finally all the
resistance is cut out and the motor runs from K to L which is full-speed,
as long as desired. As shown on these curves the resistance is poorly
proportioned on the last step, because in throwing from the 6th notch
to short-circuit, an excessive torque K is developed requiring a current
K'. This could be considerably reduced by so proportioning the resist-
ance that the 6th notch curve runs closer to the short-circuited curve.
This is, in brief, the operation of starting a motor of this type and it
appears at once that it is possible to run at any speed at will by merely
inserting enough resistance. There are two very serious objections, how-
ever, to operating a motor of this type at reduced speed, either of which
may be prohibitive for a given application. The first is poor regulation,
the second poor efficiency. Poor regulation is most easily explained by
referring again to Fig. 6. Suppose the motor is running on the first
notch at the point A, or 440 r. p. m.; the load torque increases slightly,
say 40 pounds, which is only about 10 per cent of full-load torque. At
once the speed falls nearly 17 per cent of synchronous speed to the point
B or 320 r.p.m. The change in torque is shown as X and the change in
speed as Y. Suppose, instead, the motor had been running on the short-
circuit curve at A' and the load torque increased ten per cent to If.
The motor speed in this case falls only about one per cent or the amount


Y'. A comparison of the drop in speed Y' with Y explains the poor
regulation at reduced speeds. This may become very embarrassing at
times, as for example,—suppose an operator is threading paper into the
rolls of a paper calendar. To do this it is necessary to run at about one-
tenth normal speed. He inserts resistance and begins entering the paper
between the rolls. The paper runs a little thick for awhile and the in-
creased torque almost stops the calendar. The operator then cuts out
some resistance and runs at the right speed again. The thick spot passes,
the required torque diminishes, and the motor increases its speed so
suddenly that the paper is ruptured. The operator is thoroughly annoyed
at this interruption or may even, in extreme cases, have his fingers caught
and injured. A proper study of the conditions of this application should
have indicated that the characteristics of this motor made it unfit for
this work.
The objection of poor efficiency at reduced speeds is, if possible,
more serious than that of poor regulation. It appears most readily
from the fact that whenever the motor operates at reduced speed, energy
is wasted in heating the external resistance, and, of course, the lower the
speed, the poorer the efficiency. If the efficiency curve for short-circuited
scondary is given, as in Fig. 6, suppose it is desired to obtain the efficiency
at a torque of 400 lbs. at 350 r. p. m. The efficiency from the curve is
86% when the motor is running at L or 700 r. p. m. The efficiency at
350 r. p. m. is then, for all practical purposes 350/700 of 86 percent or
43 percent, which is so low as to be prohibitive. Another view of this is,
that while the motor is delivering 400 lbs. at 350 r. p. m., or about 27 H. P.,
it is really developing 54 H. P., the remainder being wasted in the resist-
ance. These objections, of poor regulation and efficiency apply mainly
in the case of motors operated a great portion of "the time at reduced
speeds. They are not at all a serious drawback for intermittent service
such as crane, hoist, and elevator work, for which this motor is eminently
fitted.
There are several differences between phase-wound secondary mo-
tors for constant and variable speed service. The motor for constant
speed is designed to run continuously with a good power-factor and effi-
ciency. Its magnetizing current is low, giving the square shoulder to
the power-factor curve shown in Fig. 6. The resistance in the starting
device is of sufficient capacity only for overcoming heavy torques at the
moment of starting or for starting moderate torques with a minimum
current demand, as many power companies object to the starting current
drawn from the line by some commercial types of motors with squirrel
cage secondary construction. The motor for variable speed is designed
almost wholly with reference to torque rather than power, its H.P. rating


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
is only nominal, as in the case of direct-current railway or crane motors.
In the best designs the magnetizing current is high and the iron worked
very hard. This has a tendency to lower the efficiency and power-factor
and increase the temperature but the result is a greatly increased torque,
which is the object sought for. A motor of this class should always be
chosen with a maximum torque capacity at least twice the nominal rating
necessary for the work in hand.

of which makes application easier and there are occasional points of in-
terest in unfamiliar operations or machines which are worthy of notice.

Squirrel Cage Motors for Constant Speed Service. Motor Genera-
tor Sets. Of all applications of constant speed motors the most typical
is its use on motor generator sets. Small starting torque is required
and good speed regulation, which characteristics are preeminently met
by a squirrel cage motor with very low resistance in the secondary
rings. This resistance might be lowered indefinitely thereby reducing
the slip and improving the regulation, if it were not necessary to secure
sufficient torque to start the set with reasonable starting current. A fair
specification on a large set is that it shall start on thirty to forty per
cent of full voltage, and draw current not in excess of one and one-fourth
times full-load current.
Pumps: A fact always to be borne in mind when using a constant
speed motor, either alternating-current or direct-current with a centri-
fugal pump is that decreasing the head pumped against increases the load
on the motor. This seems paradoxical, but many motors have been
burned out because the user calculated that if a motor would pump a
certain quantity of water against a 40-foot head, it would have less load
at a 30-foot head. As a matter of fact the design of this type of pump
is such that it will raise considerably more than 4/3 the amount of
water 30 feet that it did 40 feet with the result that the motor is over-
loaded. In this the centrifugal pump is exactly opposite to the plunger
or reciprocating pump, which, being positive in its action, increases its
load with increase of head and vice versa. A great many centrifugal
pumps have little over-load capacity and beyond that point the load to
drive them decreases. This is sometimes useful in figuring an installation
of this kind, as pump manufacturers can always supply information re-
garding the pump characteristics.
Blowers: Rotary blowers, execpt positive blowers, have a charac-
teristic similar to centrifugal pumps, in that the load varies with the
amount of air delivered and becomes less as the pressure against which


the blower is working increases. That is to say, the maximum load
which could be put on a motor driving a blower of this nature would
be to take away all delivery pipes and let the blower exhaust into the
open air.
Line Shafting: Squirrel cage motors are used very successfully for
driving line shafting where the idle belts are run on loose pulleys, in this
way keeping down the starting torque.
Cement Mills: The use of induction motors in cement mills has
increased tremendously in the past five years and they have many points
to commend them. This application is typical of many where the atmos-
phere surrounding the motor is continuously filled with foreign matter,
which is drawn into the motor and is apt to interfere with its operation.
The possibility of entirely covering the bearings and the absence of all
other moving contacts make the squirrel cage motor successful where
the more complicated construction and moving surfaces in contact of
the wound secondary motor or the direct-current machine are damaged
by accumulation of dust. Perhaps the most typical apparatus in the
cement plant is the tube mill. This is a hollow cylinder about twenty-
two feet long and five to six feet in diameter, mounted horizontally.
This is loaded one-third to one-half full of flint pebbles about the size
of a man's fist. The cylinder is rotated and the cement clinker, already
in a fairly fine state is fed in at one end and passed through to the other
by a screw action inside the mill. The abrasion of the pebbles upon one
another and upon the clinker reduces it to the condition of commercial
cement. In starting up the mill it must be rotated through nearly ninety
degrees before the charge of pebbles and cement begins to roll. This
makes the starting condition severe and a motor should not have a
starting torque of less than twice full load torque to do the work.
Wood-Working Machinery: Almost all wood-working machinery
can be driven successfully by this type of motor with the possible excep-
tion of some heavy planers. On account of high friction and great in-
ertia, the starting torque is sometimes so high and of so long duration
(thirty seconds to one minute) that it is better to apply a wound-second-
ary motor.
Paper Machinery: Under paper machinery mention is made of
calendars. If they are driven with a constant speed motor it is necessary
to make some provision either by mechaniacl speed changing devices or
a small auxiliary motor for securing a slow threading speed. A some-
what similar problem is presented in the operation of large rotary print-
ing presses. An unsuual or "freak" application in paper manufacture is
one in connection with a "Jordan engine." This is a machine used in
the reduction of wood fibre to pulp, in which the material is forced be-


tween a conical plug and a conical shell surrounding it. The material
of this plug wears, and in order to preserve the proper working space
between plug and shell, the entire rotating part with the driving shaft
must be moved parallel to the shaft. Owing to the construction of the
Jordan engine the entire driving motor cannot be moved relative to it,
so that the motor is built with an end play of six inches, »'. c, the rotor
iron in the core is six inches wider than the stator iron and the bearings
are so arranged that the entire rotor can move endwise six inches without
otherwise interfering with the operation.
Squirrel Cage Variable Speed Motors: These motors in general
have high resistance end rings, high slip, and high starting torque. The
torque increases automatically as the speed decreases. In these general
respects they resemble a direct-current series motor and are in fact fitted
for the same class of work with the added advantage that they have a
limiting speed and cannot run away under light load.
Starting Motors: The most special application and yet the most
common is in starting rotary converters or synchronous motors. If, for
example, the rotary converter has ten poles, the starting motor is built
with eight so that when up to speed the starting motor will carry the
rotary somewhat above synchronism. When the field is put on the rotary
the added load on the starting motor due to iron loss and field copper
loss is just sufficient to pull the speed down to synchronism. It is a
most interesting and rather difficult problem in design so to arrange the
starting motor that it will have sufficient torque to start the synchronous
machine from rest and still have exactly the right torque at synchronous
speed to take care of the losses on the synchronous machine. These
motors are very successfully used on cranes for operating the trolley
bridge and hoist.
Fly Wheel Service: Another wide application is that of driving
tools which are used with fly wheels, such as punches, shears, straighten-
ing rolls and the like. It is here that the usefulness of high slip comes
in because if the fly wheel is to give up its energy it is obliged to slow
down in speed when the load comes on. A motor with good regulation
and low slip would try to run at constant speed, carrying the fly wheel
and load as well, but the motor in question "lies down" and allows the
fly wheel to carry the peak load, speeding up again when the peak has
gone by.
The application to fly wheel motor-generator sets for hoisting is
the same as that described later under wound-secondary motors.
Centrifugals: In sugar centrifugals is an application where the
sole purpose of the motor is to accelerate the load to full speed, in say
thirty seconds where it is allowed to run one minute and then shut down


to repeat the cycle a minute later. The centrifugal consists of a cylindri-
cal basket with perforated walls and mounted around a vertical shaft as
an axis. A charge of wet, syrupy sugar is placed in the basket and the
motor spins it up to a high speed, throwing it out against the basket,
where the syrup is expelled through the holes by centrifugal force leav-
ing the dried and refined sugar in the basket. Not the least curious facts
about this application are that the center of gyration changes when the
mass of sugar fiies out against the basket and the center of gyration may
or may not be in the shaft. The latter fact makes it necessary to have
the shaft flexibly connected so that it may follow the gyroscopic action
of the mass. Also the grain of the sugar is affected by the rate of accel-
eration—certainly a very close relation between speed-torque characteristic
and product. The same principle is used in laundry extractors where
the wet linen is placed in a similar perforated basket and the water
whirled out by centrifugal force.
Torque Motors: This type is often used to apply brakes, to move
the cross heads of heavy machine tools or to open or close heavy valves.
In this service they are sometimes called "torque motors" for the reason
that they work but a few revolutions and come to rest again.
Constant Speed Motors with Phase-Wound Secondaries: There are
classes of service which require a heavy starting torque combined with
close speed regulation after the motor is up to speed. These require-
ments are exactly met by a motor with a phase-wound secondary. The
secondary winding itself has a very low resistance, which means a small
"slip," high running efficiency and power factor and good regulation
when the secondary is short-circuited, as explained above. It would
also mean poor starting torque and high starting current if of the squir-
rel cage construction but the insertion of external resistance enables the
motor to develop maximum torque at the start with a moderate starting
current. In this way these apparently contradictory requirements are
most satisfactorily met.
Flour Mills: Prominent in this class are flour mills. The number
of line shafts, belts and gears makes a very heavy starting condition
and the nature of the product and its quality demand absolute speed
within i or 2 revolutions per minute. The best solution is the phase-
wound rotor.
Other examples: There is another class of machinery which is
not so exacting about regulation but which has the same feature of
heavy starting and runs continuously after once up to speed. Under
this head come most of the applications of this type of motor. They
are: paper pulp grinders, which, on account of the inertia of the grind-
stones arc hard to start; pulp heaters which stir up the pulp in process


of manufacture and which start hard because the pulp settles nearly
solid around the moving parts when the machine is at rest; belt con-
veyors, which may be required to start when full of coal, crushed rock
or cement; air compressors, which have a high starting friction because
of the construction and the number of parts; line shafting where the
belts run for the most part on the working pulleys and therefore heavy
to start. It is interesting to note in passing that under the best possible
conditions if line shafting is employed the loss of power from this
source alone, due to friction is twenty-five to thirty per cent and may
easily run up to forty or fifty per cent. This is strong argument for
individual drive of machines wherever practicable.
Driving Wheel Lathe: It has been stated that this type is not
fitted in general for individual drive on machine tools but there is one
interesting case where such an application is made successfully. In turn-
ing up driving wheels for locomotives a special lathe is used. As the diame-
ter is nearly always the same and this lathe handles only one job, the
speed is practically constant. It so happens that occasionally there is
a hard spot in the steel over a considerable arc of the circumference and
if the entire cut is made at one speed, the tool is damaged by this hard
spot. On account of the large cutting diameter the r.p.m. is small so
that if provided with a motor of the type in question the operator can
throw in resistance enough to reduce the speed about fifteen per cent
while cutting the hard spot and throw it out again so as to cut the re-
mainder of the revolution at full speed. In practice, when the hard
spot is discovered, the operator marks that portion with a chalk mark
and slows down the lathe each revolution when this section approaches
the tool.
Motors with Phase-Wound Secondaries for Variable Speed Service:
The application which is typical of this class is found in hoist and crane
service. Motors for this work are designed for intermittent operation
and given a nominal rating based upon the horse-power which they will
develop for one-half hour with 40°C. rise. They never operate for as
long a period as 30 minutes continuously and they are called upon at
times to develop a torque greatly in excess of their nominal rating. For
these reasons motors of this class should never be applied on a horse-
power basis but always on a torque basis. Since torque is the main con-
sideration and the service is intermittent these motors are usually wound
for the maximum torque which they will develop and given a nominal
rating based upon one-third to one-half of this torque. The frame will
carry this for 30 minutes with a safe rise in temperature and there is
a margin of two to three times the rated torque, which in general is
sufficient, to take care of the peak demand. In case there is a variable


cycle to be performed and it is known how many seconds are required
for each operation and what torque is necessary, it is customary to calcu-
late the square root of the mean square current for the whole cycle and
select the proper capacity on this basis. For all elevator, winch, con-
tractor, skip or single drum hoist work, a motor, which will develop the
power required and carry the equivalent square root of the mean square
current for one-half hour with a safe temperature rise, and which has a
maximum torque equal to or greater than the maximum torque required
by any part of the cycle, will be satisfactory. Double drum hoists, hoist-
ing in balance, and large mine haulage propositions in general require
a motor rated on a different basis. For this service the motor should have
the necessary maximum torque and be able to develop for about two or
three hours, with a safe rise in temperature, a horsepower equivalent to
the square root of the mean square requirement of the hoisting cycle.
These are only general rules and the most careful consideration should
be given in each individual case to secure a motor which will perform the
work satisfactorily.
In consequence of being wound for a high torque these motors
have a high magnetizing current and consequently a lower power-factor
at light loads than a continuous-rated motor on the same frame would
have. The reasons for this can be seen by referring again to Figs. I and 2
and the discussion of these curves.'
Turntable Donkeys.—An interesting application of this type is that
of the operation of turntables in round houses and railroad shops, for
turning locomotives. There is usually a carriage provided for the motor
called a "tractor" or a "donkey," which runs on the same rail as the turn-
table to which it is secured. The current is carried into the motor
through collector rings on the center pin on which the table turns, or
in some similar way by the use of moving contacts.
Coal and Ore Unloading Machinery—Dredges—Power Shovels.—
In apparatus of this type there are usually several motions. There is a
bucket or shovel of the clam shell or similar type, which is lowered into
the material to be moved, closed, hoisted, swung around and dumped.
The hoisting apparatus in itself is very ingenious and two or three of
these motions may be taken care of in some cases by one motor. In
other cases there are separate motors for each motion. Owing to
the complication of the cycle of operation there is more difficulty in
providing a motor for this apparatus than in the case of a plain hoist.
Usually the number of cycles per hour given is the maximum which the
apparatus can develop and in practice it will not be possible to operate
at so high a speed. This in itself is somewhat of a factor of safety


though not one which can be relied upon, as the test for acceptance is
ordinarily made at the contract number of operations per hour.
The most impressive application of motors of this class and perhaps
in the operation of any electrical apparatus is the fly wheel motor-genera-
tor-set for hoisting or for heavy reversing roll service in steel mills.
Service of this nature is extremely fluctuating in its requirements, having
very great peaks one instant and almost nothing the next. This is a
severe strain on the generating plant from which power is being drawn—
and in addition, power is often charged for on the basis of the peak re-
quirement. It is evidently a great advantage to apply some device in the
nature of a fly wheel which shall smooth off these peaks and even up the
demand. A mechanical fly wheel on the hoist or roll itself is impossible
because they are obliged to reverse. The same result is accomplished in
the following manner: On the hoist or roll is a direct-current motor
having its armature electrically connected to the armature of a generator
which drives it, and having its fields separately excited. The driving
generator also has its fields separately excited and is part of a direct-
connected, three-unit set, the other two units being a wound-secondary
induction motor and a heavy fly wheel. Assuming the case of a hoist,
the heavy demand comes when the hoist motor accelerates the load. This
peak comes back to the generator and through it to the induction motor.
As soon as the induction motor begins to draw increased current through
its primary from the line, resistance is cut into the secondary circuit by
series relays in the primary circuit. As has been shown, the effect of
this resistance would be to decrease the speed of the motor-generator set,
but before this can happen the fly wheel must give up part of its stored
energy, thus supplying the peak. When the load is accelerated the demand
falls and the relay again automatically short-circuits the secondary resist-
ance, allowing the motor-generator set to come gradually to full speed
again. The only thing in the operator's control is the generator shunt
field and by a small master controller he reduces this to zero or builds
it up in either direction, thereby stopping or reversing the hoist motor
at will. The motor-generator set runs continuously with its automatic
regulation and there is furnished the spectacle of starting, stopping and
reversing a motor of thousands of horse-power in five or six seconds, by
a slight turn of the hand, without the least jar either on the driven
machine or the generating system.


THE POLYPHASE ELECTROLYTIC RECTIFIER
By Benjamin F. Baiuby, B.S. '98, Ph.D. '07.
Asst. Prof. Electrical Engineering, University of Michigan.
It is often necessary or desirable to transform alternating current
into direct current. When this is done on a large scale, rotary converters
or motor generators are used. When only a small amount of direct
current is required, as for example to charge an automobile battery, the
mercury arc rectifier is usually employed. Where first cost is of import-
ance and only a limited amount of power is to be transformed, use can
often be made of an electrolytic rectifier. It was to examine some of the
properties of these rectifiers, especially when constructed in a special
polyphase form, that the following investigation was undertaken.
The electroyltic rectifier, as usually used, consists of two plates, one
of which is aluminum immersed in a proper solution. A great number
of substances may be used for the second plate, but lead, iron or carbon
are those most frequently employed. The solution is usually sodium car-
bonate or potassium phosphate, but many others may be used. Such a
cell if inserted in an alternating current circuit will allow the current
to pass freely in the direction from lead to aluminum but interposes a
great resistance to its passage in the opposite direction. The current is
thus to a certain extent rectified. The apparatus so constructed has, how-
ever, two serious defects. In the first place it is rather inefficient, 40%
being about the maximum obtainable, and secondly the rectification is
very imperfect, the current consisting of alternate large and small waves
in opposite directions. The small waves are due to the fact that a certain
amount of current passes in the wrong way or leaks past the electric
valve. The purpose of this investigation was to see if an improvement
could not be effected both in efficiency and in the perfection of the rectifi-
cation, by the use of polyphase currents.
An investigation was first made of a rectifier inserted in a single
phase circuit as in Fig. 1. The source of current, marked D in the figure,
was 5 K. W., 60 cycle, alternating current, generator. This machine can
be connected so as to give single, two, three, or six phase currents.
Fortunately its curve of e. m. f. is very nearly a sine wave with any of
the above connections. In the circuit of Fig. I, in addition to what is
shown there were connected, a wattmeter measuring the power supplied
by the dynamo to the rectifier and lamps, an alternating current voltmeter


8l
measuring cither the voltage of the dynamo or that across the lamps, an
elecro-dynamometer, measuring the current in the circuit, a direct current
ammeter in the same circuit, and a direct current voltmeter measuring
the voltage across the lamps.
There was also connected to the shaft of the dynamo an instan-
taneous contact maker. Provision was made by means of mercury cups
so that a circuit could be made from any two of the three points a, b or c,
through the contact maker to an ordinary direct current voltmeter. This
later is shunted by a condenser of about one micro-farrad. As is well
known deflection of the voltmeter will be proportional to the instantaneous
value of the e. m. f. at the time of contact. The contact brush can be set
so as to make contact at different points in the wave. In this way curves
of current and e. m. f. can be quickly and accurately taken. At the same
time it is possible to measure the efficiency, power factor, etc., of the cell.
In measuring the efficiency two methods are possible, depending upon
what we understand by the output. The input is obviously the reading
of a wattmeter connected so as to measure the total power supplied to
both cells and lamps. The output might be measured by means of a watt-
meter measuring the total input into the lamps. This is the true power
output of the rectifier. However, the rectifier is to be used to produce
direct current and it seems better to call the output the product of the
volts and amperes as measured by direct current instruments. Of these
two efficiencies, the former would be considerably higher. In this article.


unless otherwise stated, efficiency means output as measured by direct
current instruments, divided by the input to both rectifier and load as
measured by a wattmeter.
There is a considerable loss of power in the rectifier, and it conse-
quently heats up rather rapidly. In this work no especial precautions were
taken to keep the temperatures absolutely constant but it was held at
a reasonably constant point, by immersing the rectifier in a large jar con-
taining running water.
The curves of current and e.m.f. of such a circuit are shown in
Fig. 2. A is the applied e.m.f. This is slightly distorted from its original
sine shape. B is the curve of current through the lamps and rectifier.
It will be seen that it consists of one small wave and one larger one.
The small wave represents that portion of the current that "leaks"
through the rectifier from lead to aluminium. The larger portion is
that part which passes in the useful direction. For most purposes, such
as charging a storage battery, the difference of these two waves would
be the net useful current.
C is the curve of potential difference between the two plates of the
rectifier. It rises to a much greater height during the first half of the
wave, due to the polarization of the cell. Of course if the action of the
cell were perfect the curve would be of the same shape as the curve of
applied e.m.f. during the first half of the wave and would be zero during
the second half.
One curious fact will be noticed. This back e.m.f. of the electrolytic
cell is due to the applied e.m.f. and disappears with it. However, this
disappearance does not take place instantly although it does so in a
very short time. From an inspection of Fig. 2 it will be seen that curve
C falls below curve A everywhere up to about the point 48° where the
curves cross and for about 270 or 0.0013 seconds this polarization e.m.f.
is acting in the same direction as the current or is returning stored
energy to the circuit. This is evident also from the fact that the current
B crosses the axis before the curve of e.m.f. does so. This can only take
place in the presence of a back e.m.f. due either to polarization on to a
condenser action between the liquid and the aluminum plate.
The applied alternating e.m.f. was 45 volts and the current passing
3.56 amperes. The reading of the wattmeter was 151 watts. This cor-
responds to a power factor of 0.94 and the current, as shown by the
curves, is slightly leading. Measured across the lamps the voltage of
the output was 24 and the current of course the same as before. The
efficiency figures from this standpoint is 57%. This is the value usually
considered. The true efficiency treating the rectifier as a producer of
direct current energy is much lower. The amperage measured by a direct


•


THE MICHIGAN TECH NIC
current ammeter was only 0.06 instead of 3.56 and the voltage 6.7 in
contrast to 24. Thus the direct current output is only 64 watts and the
efficiency drops to the very low value of 4.2%.
The arrangement of apparatus was now modified somewhat as
shown in Fig. 3. The rectifier used had six aluminum plates which
could be connected together to form one large plate. In the work just
described only one of the aluminum plates was in use the other five
being disconnected. Now another one was added and connected to the
alternator. The winding represented might be the secondary of a trans-
JL.

former with "a" the neutral point. With this connection, current from
a b will pass as shown by the arrow through the lamps or other load
to the lead plate. From there it flows to the aluminum electrode which
at the instant happens to be negative with respect to he lead.
In addition to this current there will be also a leakage current pass-
ing directly from one aluminum plate to the other. Moreover, there will
be twice as much voltage available to cause this leakage current as there
is for the useful current.
The curves obtained from such an arrangement are shown in Fig. 4.
Only one curve of applied E.M.F. "a" is shown. This corresponds to
that between say a and b in Fig. 3. That from A to C would be the
same shape but displaced 1800.'
Examining b the curve of current, it will be noticed that it now


to


THE MICHIGAN TECHN1C
approaches more nearly to a uniform direct current and that there is
no negative portion whatever. At first sight it may appear strange that
the direct current does not drop to zero at or near the point of zero
applied E.M.F. That it does not do so ,is due to the property of the
cell previously described of storing a small amount of energy. Where
current has been passing from the lead to one of the aluminum plates,
the leakage current between the two aluminum plates has been charging
the other aluminum plate. When the applied E.M.F. decreases to less
than the value of this polarization e.m.f. current begins to pass from
the lead plate to the charged aluminum plate instead of to the other. It
is thus flowing in the other circuit for an instant against the e.m.f. there,
F,
ST
and this restored energy is sufficient to bridge over the gap and prevent
the current from dropping to zero.
It will be noticed in Fig. 4 that the curve of applied e.m.f. is con-
siderably distorted from the sine shape, being much flatter on top. In
addition it is not of the same height on the two sides on account of the
much larger current flowing, during the first wave. The value of the
polarization e.m.f. curve C is also greater on account of the applied voltage
being doubled.
The next arrangement tried was a three phase connection. This
is shown diagramatically in Fig. 5. We now use three aluminum plates
and the one lead one. The corresponding curves are shown in Fig. 6 in
which as before a is the applied alternating voltage between the neutral
point and one terminal, "b" the current or voltage curve of the current
through the lamps, and c the curve of e.m.f. between the lead plate and
the corresponding aluminum plate.


TUB MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Examining Fig. 6 it is evident that we have still further improved
our direct current. The fluctuations are now 1200 apart, instead of 180°
and are much smaller. The violent distortion of the curve of applied
e.m.f. is rather astonishing. It will be noticed that it follows closely the
shape of the current curve, while it is furnishing current to the circuit
and is prevented from departing greatly in value from the e.m.f. over
the lamps by the great drain in current upon it that would result if it
did so. This is undoubtedly the cause of the great distortion. During
the negative values of this e.m.f. it is not so hampered as it is furnish-
ing no current except the leakage current. It consequently rises higher
and is less distorted, the remaining distortion being doubtless due to
the reaction of the other circuits upon it.
The last arrangement tried was a six phase rectifier. The connec-
tions are shown in Fig. 7. With this arrangement quite a perfect rectifi-
cation was obtained as can be seen from Fig. 8. The curve of current
"a" is now almost a straight line. The same violent distortion of the
e.m.f. curve can be seen, and the fact that the curve of e.m.f. between
aluminum and lead has positive values during only about So" shows that
each phase contributes energy to the direct current circuit during about
one-fifth of the time. It should also be noted that the curve of applied
e.m.f. rises above the back e.m.f. of the lamps at exactly the same time
that the curve of potential between aluminum and lead crosses the zero
axis.




In these experiments only a non-inductive load was used. The in-
troduction of an inductive resistance of small ohmic resistance would
make the direct current much more constant by tending to oppose the
fluctuations of current. This is especially true here since on a 60 cycle
circuit we have a frequency of fluctuation of 360; hence the choking
action would be very strong.
The readings of the instruments in the circuit give us some inter-
esting data. The voltage of the alternating current supply measured
from the neutral to any terminal was 57.7. The direct current volt-
meter, connected to the terminals of the load, read 54.5, only slightly
lower. The output of direct current was 9.2 amperes. These two latter
quantities were almost exactly the same whether read with direct current
or alternating current instruments, showing very good rectification.
The contrast of the efficiency in the different methosd of working
is rather striking. With the ordinary single phase arrangement the
efficiency was only 4.2%. With the double connection it jumped to 38%.
The three phase connection showed 42% and finally with the six phase
connection it rose to 69%. These were taken after the rectifier had been
in operation for an hour or more and had attained a temperature of
about 40°C. They are in every respect commercial results. The same
cell was used throughout all these tests without any attention whatever,
and the same results could be realized in every day practice. If special
precautions had been taken to keep the cell cool, the efficiency would
have been higher. This is certainly a better efficiency than would be ob-
tained from a motor generator set of less than at least 5 K.W. capacity.
The power factor of the six phase rectifier with the same load
was 72%. Fig. 8 does not show the current in each phase, but since the
current probably flows only during the time current C has positive values,
we can get an approximate idea of the relation of e.m.f. and current.
From an 'inspection it is evident that the current lags about 40° behind
the e.m.f.
The combinations described are of course not the only ones possible.
A four phase arrangement is the one that would be used with a two
phase supply. This would require two transformers, one on each phase.
The four terminals would be connected to four aluminum plates. The
two neutral points of the transformers would be connected together and
the receiving apparatus inserted between this point and the lead plate.
The results as regards efficiency and perfection of rectification would
be better than those of the three phase and somewhat poorer than those
of the six phase arrangement. This latter could of course be readily
derived from three transformers on a three phase circuit.
Finally it should be pointed out that still better results could be




derived from a still greater number of phases. A transformer might
for example be constructed, charging from two or three to say twenty-
four phases. This connected to a rectifier having twenty-four aluminum
plates would give a direct current approximately as nearly uniform as
that from a two pole generator with twenty-four commutator bars. How-
ever, the four or six phase connection gives results amply good enough
for almost any practical purpose. The apparatus is very simple and
cheap and would seem well adapted to many purposes where a small
amount of direct current is needed.
Sometime after the foregoing work was completed a special recti-
fier was made of cast iron with both internal and external ribs to assist in
cooling. This was placed in a larger tank containing running water.
The cast iron vessel acted as the neutral electrode, instead of the lead
previously employed.
With this apparatus a large number of experiments were under-
taken. The solution which gave the best results was sodium phosphate
(NaHjPO.). Nitrates could not be used at all and the addition of a
small amount of sulphuric acid largely destroyed the rectifying power.
Ordinary city water rectifies to a certain extent.
Fig. 9 shows the results of a test on an ordinary no volt, 60 cycle,
two phase commercial circuit. It will be noted that both the efficiency
and the power factor rise rapidly and stay practically constant over the
whole range of the rectifier. The voltage however drops off rather
rapidly falling from yy to 57 volts. The maximum efficiency is about 78%
and the best power factor 74%. These figures would probably not be
equalled by any other apparatus of as small capacity.
The principal trouble with the rectifier in practice is that it tends
to heat rapidly. If this is allowed to take place, the rectification becomes
imperfect and the efficiency drops to a low value. Probably if th«
solution could be kept very cold the efficiency might be very much im-
proved.
The electrolytic rectifier is apparently not well adapted for use where
large amounts of power are to be handled. Where only a small quantity
of direct current is required, its simplicity, cheapness and absence of
moving parts arc strong recommendations and it should find a fairly
extensive use.

THRUST BEARING FOR STEAM LAUNCH
By E. B. Conrad, '90.
In 1904, the United States War Department constructed four steam
launches, sixty feet long, which were put into service at forts stationed
along the Atlantic Coast, these boats being used for transportation of
officers and men from the fort to local points; also in towing targets
and general utility. They were of heavy construtcion, but were nicely
finished. They proved so successful in service that four more were
called for in 1906, and The Electric Launch Company, with which the
writer is connected, secured the contract for building these four boats.
Before starting work, it was requested that the old boats be inspected,
to learn what improvements could be made in the construction of the
hulls or their machinery, and accordingly, the writer with the Marine
Engineer of the War Department visited two forts where two of these
launches were located, one at New Bedford, Mass., and the other at
Fort Greble, Newport, R. I.
Among other things, it was noted that trouble was being had with
the thrust bearing. On one launch a constant stream of water was led
from the centrifugal circulating pump so as to keep down the heat of
the thrust. On looking over this part of the equipment and making cal-
culations, the decision was reached that the area of the thrust was
sufficient, but there were two bad points in the design which caused the
heating; first, sufficient attention had not been given to the lubrication
problem, and second, the thrust body was not stiff enough to resist dis-
tortion. To correct these faults, a new design was prepared and from
the drawing which is given herewith, it will be noticed that a slot, one-
half inch wide was made in the outer thrust plates, leading from an
oil groove which could be filled by a channel leading from an oil
cup or other device, thus feeding oil direct to the face of the revolving
thrust plate. These outer stationary thrust plates were faced with genuine
babbit, thoroughly hammered and afterwards faced in the lathe; six
radial grooves cut from the hole to an outer circumferential groove which
would lead any superfluous oil thrown by centrifugal action from the
outer ring back into the radial grooves at the top. Over "the entire
thrust block was placed a brass cover, into the under sfde of the top
of which were inserted leaders conveying the oil which was thrown off,
back into the side openings, thus making the lubrication automatic. Oil


was placed in the base of the thrust body so that the whole apparatus
was well lubricated.
It will be noticed that the center of the shaft was six and one-half
inches above the base of the thrust which gave considerable leverage.
The base therefore, was lengthened to eighteen inches, the outer and
inner plates made heavier and instead of the thrust being taken by the
for and aft sides of the body, webs were extended to the fore and aft
ends of the base, which strengthened both the walls and the base itself.
All these changes resulted in a thrust which ran absolutely cool, the
oiling being automatic, and at no time did any more heat develop than
was conducted to it from adjacent connected parts of the engine. The
engine was a vertical, direct-acting, compound, surface condensing en-
gine, with high pressure cylinder six inches diameter, low pressure cyl-
inder twelve inches diameter, having a stroke of ten inches, working
pressure one hundred and seventy-five pounds per square inch, and with
a propeller wheel forty-four inches in diameter, 48.4" pitch, surface ratio
thirty-six per cent, there was developed a speed of three hundred and
eighty-five revolutions, giving one hundred and fifty-four indicated horse-
power.
While the original design might have been stiff enough, it was cer-
tain that the lubricating question had not been thoroughly worked out
From this experience, it is shown how necessary that all details of lubri-
cation be fully considered as it is just as essential to provide for proper
lubrication as it is for proper strength. From the fact that the specifi-
cations called for a bearing pressure of not more than thirty-five pounds
per square inch, it will be seen that lack of area was not the cause of
heating. The diameter of the thrust is rather large, but the velocity
at the outer surafce was within good engineering limits. The actual
pressure given from the calculated thrust is less than thirty pounds per
square inch.

•THE MATHEMATICIAN IN LOVE'
By Professor Rankine.
The following piece of poetry was handed to us by an old graduate
who vouches for them in his letter as follows:
"A day or so ago a Scotch friend of mine, and a University of
Glasgow man, gave me the enclosed verses, by Professor Rankine. I
don't know that they were ever published though you may have seen
them. This gentleman was a neighbor of Lord Kelvin and remembered
Professor Rankine, though he never knew him personally, and some
of the Professor's verses fell into his hands.
"I thought it might be of interest to the many Technic readers
who have sweat over Rankine's Theories, to know that the gentleman
had some lighter moments."
A Mathematician fell madly in love
With a lady, young, handsome, and charming:
By angles and ratios harmonic he strove
Her curves and proportions all faultless to prove,
As he scrawled hieroglyphics alarming. (See end.)
He measured with care, from the ends of a base,
The arcs which her features subtended:
Then he framed transcendental equations, to trace
The flowing outlines of her figure and face.
And thought the result very splendid.
He studied (since music has charms for the fair)
The theory of fiddles and whistles,—
Then composed, by acoustic equations, an air,
Which, when 'twas performed, made the lady's long hair
Stand on end, like a porcupine's bristles.
The lady loved dancing,—he therefore applied,
To the polka and waltz, an equation;
But when to rotate on his axis he tried,
His centre of gravity swayed to one side,
And he fell, by the earth's gravitation.


No doubts of the fate of his suit made him pause,
For he proved to his own satisfaction,
That the fair one returned his affection;—"because,
"As every. one knows, by mechanical laws,
"Re-action is equal to action."
"Let x denote beauty,—y, manners well-bred,—
"z, Fortune,—(this last is essential),—
"Let L stand for love"—our philosopher said,—
"Then L is a function of x, y, and z,*
"Of the kind which is known as potential."
L = *(x, y, z)
"Now integrate L with respect to dt,
"(t standing for time and persuasion);
"Then, between proper limits, 'tis easy to see,
"The definite integral Marriage must be,—
"(A very concise demonstration)."
J^
oo
Ldt = M

Said he—"If the wandering course of the moon
"By Algebra can be predicted,
"The female affections must yield to it soon"—
—But the lady ran off with a dashing dragoon,
And left him amazed and afflicted.
