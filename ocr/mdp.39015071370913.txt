bers known generally as the silicones are
the most recently utilized in all the
rapidly expanding field of synthetic
plastics. Their specialized worth was
only recognized and developed during
World War II, and even now all of the
possible uses of this type of plastic have
not been explored. But despite such re-
cent practical use, the fact that organo-
silicon compounds could be formed and
that some of these would polymerize to
form high molecular weight materials
was known for some time.
As long ago as 1875, some work had
been done in synthesizing silicon com-
pounds containing one or more organic
groups, but this consisted mainly of
work with the various silicon hydrides
and organo-hydrides, and experimental
work was confined largely to the follow-
ing class of equations:
HC1
■ft 2%.( MR:Si )f+ SiH
RSiHs, R,SiH!, R3SiH, etc.
RC1
&gt;
Cat.
It was not until the turn of the cen-
tury that Dr. F. S. Kipping, Professor
of Chemistry at the University of Not-
tingham, conducted his series of experi-
ments on the organo-siloxanes. In-
trigued by the similarity of silicon and
carbon as regards their place in the
periodic table, he endeavored to build
up a chemistry of silicon much like the
organic chemistry of carbon. The chem-
ists of today owe much to his extensive
work.
Working with the halides of silicon
instead of hydrides, Kipping succeeded
in preparing many compounds analo-
gous to the carbon ketones, ethers, and
alcohols. (The present term "silicone"
is Kipping's shortened version of sili-
cone-ketone.) Using organic halides and
magnesium in the form of the familiar
Grignard reagents, he created substi-
tuted methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, and
phenyl silicones by hydrolyzing the cor-
responding chlorides. A typical reaction
is:
SiCL -f 3 CHcMgCl—►(CH,), SiCi + 3 MgCI,
+ H,0

With the dihalosilanes, Kipping ran
into "glue-like," tarry substances that
resisted analysis. He did however, pos-
tulate a simple structure and isolate
small amounts of a trimer.

The actual structure of the compound

trimer or a long chain polymer:

Although Kipping succeeded in creat-
ing these organo-silicon compounds, they
did not act like their carbon counter-
parts at all, and it remained for the
chemists of the 1940's to put these
materials to practical use.
In 1939, about the time of the out-
break of hostilities, the Corning Glass
Co. was interested in some means of
waterproofing or making water-repellent
their new product. Fiberglas, a cottony
material that could be woven into cloth
or matted into a form of batting which
showed good heat and sound insulating
properties. Water condensed on this
batting when it was used as insulation
on high altitude bombers, adding sev-
eral hundred pounds to the planes'
weight.
At the same time, in the General
Electric laboratories in Schenectady, a
research for some new heat-resistant
insulator which could be used to impreg-
nate generators and motors was inaugu-
rated. Dynamos of all types could be
made much lighter and smaller, an im-
portant item in aerial design, if they
could be allowed to run hotter, but at
that time the best impregnating var-
nishes and insulation would oxidize and
break down rapidly at temperatures ex-
ceeding 1S0°-175° C. Similarly, heat-
resistant rubber or rubber-like gaskets
were needed for the General Electric
turbines and superchargers.
Both of these projects are responsi-
ble for developing the silicone resins.
Reviewing Kipping's earlier work, and
reasoning that perhaps a silicon-oxygen-
silicon chain would be more heat stable
than a carbon chain and that, suitably
substituted with organic groups to in-
troduce water resistance, it could be •
more readily bonded to silicious mate-
rials than to straight organic water-
proofers, research workers in both plants
seat out to investigate the properties of
this class of polymers.
Obviously, the first thing to do was
prepare the silicones in sufficient quan-
tity so that a careful study of them
might be made. To do this, a method
of producing the silicon halides had to
be found; the alkyl and aryl halides as
well as magnesium metal were plenti-
fully available. Schumb and Gamble
investigated a method of deriving the
halides from calcium silicide and chlo-
rine.

MODERN PRODUCTION
by
ARTHUR L. JONES, JR., '47E
what is motion study
Motion study is the simplest form of
job study and may be denned as the
analysis of methods, layout, materials,
tools, and equipment used in accom-
plishing a given task. The purpose is
job simplification resulting in quicker
and cheaper work performance.
It must be emphasized that motion
study is not speed-up. It results in
faster output, not through greater ef-
fort on the part of the worker, but by
elimination of waste motions and phy-
sical exertion by means of effective
planning, layout, and improved methods.
Contrary to frequent misconception,
motion study and time study are not
synonymous, though a complete job
study demands each of them. Time
study, in brief, measures the time re-
quired to accomplish a given task. Mo-
tion study finds means to reduce the
time required.
increasing emphasis being
placed on motion study
During the present period of raw ma-
terial increases and inflated wage scales,
the battle of management to keep unit
production costs low enough to permit
them to sell their products at a price
within the limits demanded by competi-
tion and still allow a reasonable margin
of profit becomes a difficult one. "How,"
asks management, "can we reduce
costs?" Investigation reveals the follow-
ing possibilities:
1. Substitution of cheaper raw mater-
ials. This can rarely be done without
a decrease in the quality of the finished
product, usually an undesirable step.
2. Improvement of the flow of mater-
ials through the plant. This calls for
the elimination of bottlenecks and ex-
pensive delays in the handling of raw
materials and works-in-process.
3. Use of improved equipment. New
and more efficient types of machinery
may be substituted for existing ones,
resulting in a lower cost per unit for the
operation.

Arthur L. Jones, Jr.
4. Better maintenance of machinery
and equipment resulting in lower ex-
penditures for repairs and replacements.
5. Job simplification through motion
study.
Labor cost is frequently the largest
single item of expense entailed in manu-
facturing a marketable product. In the
automotive industry, unit labor costs in
some plants equal more than one-third
the price you pay for the car you pur-
chase from your neighborhood sales-
room.
The development of motion economy
has become, therefore, one of industry's
most potent weapons against waste.
operations determined
from process charts
A process chart is a tool of manage-
ment, important in motion study as an
aid in making a new plant layout or in
modifying an existing one. It is a com-
pact and graphic record, in words and
symbols, of each step in the production
process as a manufactured article moves
through the plant. Beginning with the
raw material entering the factory, the
route is shown as it progresses through
storage, machining, and assembly opera-
tions until it emerges as a finished unit
or sub-assembly. A portion of a proc-
ess chart for the Corduroy Rubber Co.,
of Grand Rapids, Mich., is shown in
Figure 2.
In making use of the process chart,
the analyst should ask the following
questions about each operation:
1. What is the operation to be done?
2. Is the operation really necessary,
or can it be eliminated?
3. How is the operation to be done?
4. Who is to perform the operation?
5. At what stage in the production
cycle is the operation to be done?
6. Is mechanical handling equipment
used wherever it would be more effective
than manual handling?
Such analysis often will show a long
haul that can be eliminated by allowing
the operation to be performed earlier in
the production cycle. Frequently an
operation can be eliminated altogether,
or combined with a similar one, with a
resultant saving in transportation, labor,
and equipment costs. Great savings are
often made by installing automatic ma-
terial handling devices.
operation analysis
A mass production worker repeats the
same series, or cycle, or motions each
time he performs a piece of work. This
series of operations is known as the job,
or operation, cycle. The expense of his
contribution toward the finished product
is proportional to the length of the oper-
ation cycle.
The analysis of a specific operation
often calls for considerable ingenuity,
imagination, and inventive ability. Clos-
est scrutiny is given to the method used
in doing the work, but careful consid-
eration must also be given to the ma-
terials used, the tools, jigs, fixtures, ma-
terial handling equipment, work layout,
working conditions, and all other factors
affecting the job. Co-operation of the
foreman, tool designer, and the worker
often prove invaluable to the analyst.
Important phases of the job that
should be considered are:
I. Materials
1. Is the material brought to the oper-
12
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


II. Materials Handling
1. Are delays in material delivery to
the operator reduced to a minimum?
2. Can conveyors or mechanical de-
vices be employed to relieve the opera-
tor of material handling?
III. Tools, Jigs, and Fixtures
1. Are the tools the best suited for
this kind of work?
2. Are the tools kept in proper condi-
tion?
3. Would redesigning the tools, or
fixtures result in job simplification?
4. Are pins and stops used to shorten
positioning time?
IV. Machine
1. Can the machine speed be increased
without speeding up the operator?
2. Can an automatic feed be used?
3. Can the operation be combined
with another one?
4. Can the work be done in multiple?
V. Operation Layout
1. Are all tools and materials in the
normal work area?
2. Can some work be shifted from the
hands to the feet?
3. Can use be made of gravity feed
from chutes?
4. Can automatic ejectors be used?
5. Can "drop delivery" into a bin or
onto a conveyor be made of the part
after processing?
6. Is the motion path of the hands
free from barriers or obstructions?
7. Is the layout such that needless eye
movements are demanded of the
worker?
8. Are the machine controls central-
ized?
VI. Operator
1. Is the operator properly trained?
2. Is arrangement made for the opera-
tor to work in either a sitting or stand-
ing position?
3. Is the operator allowed adequate
rest periods?
4. Are working conditions as ideal as
possible?
5. Does the operator make the most
efficient use of his hands?
The last point offers probably the
most fertile field of operation analysis.
Bad work habits are difficult to detect
and sometimes it is equally difficult to
convince the operator there is a better
way. Some laws to follow when study-
ing worker motions are:
1. Do not use the hand for holding
materials. The hands are an expensive
holding device.
2. Pre-position tools. Arrangement
should be such that when a tool is used
it is returned to its original position
ready for re-use.
3. Do not change control with the
hands. Once a hand has begun a definite
task, do not replace it with the other.
4. Avoid irregular motion paths.
Eliminate direction changes.
5. Eliminate all motions that do not
contribute something toward task com-
pletion.
6. Keep both hands busy at the same
time wherever possible.
A. Before Motion Studv
motion study, broke elements into sub-
divisions which his experience had
shown him to be common to all kinds of
work. He gave them the name of
therbligs, which is his own name spelled
backwards. Other investigators since
Gilbreth have added to his original list
of seventeen therbligs. A therblig can
be thought of as an element of an
element. The following are among the
most commonly used:

elements
An operation cycle can be broken
down into several elements. An element
is a division of an operation requiring
a blending of motions of such duration
that it can be timed. A michronometer,
the timing device generally used, records
the time in increments of 1/2000 of a
second.
A man working on a drill press may
go through an operation cycle comprised
of the following elements:
1. Pick up piece, locate in fixture, lock
fixture.
2. Drill two holes.
3. Unlock fixture, remove piece, dis-
pose of piece.
4. Brush shavings from jig.
The analyst will time and study each
of the four above elements by separat-
ing them into their composite thebligs.

michigan technic
On October 1, the staff of THE
MICHIGAN TECHNIC held their
first business and organizational meet-
ing. After the debris had been cleared
away, the staff was found to be forty
people strong; for the first time in five
years it is up to prewar strength. Gen-
eral plans were made for the school
year, 1946-47, and the staff appoint-
ments were made to all departments.
The Publication Board this year is
as follows:
Milton David, Editor-in-Chief
Betty Hansen, Associate Editor
Henry Kaminski, Business Manager
William Squire, Managing Editor
Besides publishing the magazine reg-
ularly throughout the school year, it is
the duty of the Publication Board to re-
cruit new staff members from the Eng-
ineering student body, to provide the
future leaders of the TECHNIC. Ac-
cordingly, any engineering student who
is interested in working into a responsi-
ble position on the TECHNIC staff
should call at the office, Room 3036
East Engineering Building, and prove
himself willing to work.
Staff appointments are made on the
basis of the ability and willingness of
the applicants to accept responsibility.
Any student eligible for activities is eli-
gible to apply for a TECHNIC staff
position. Freshmen are accepted on a
try-out basis, and their appointments
follow upon one semester's service as a
tryout.
a.i.ch.e. expands
In 1921, the American Institute of
Chemical Engineers revised their by-
laws to permit the organization at uni-
versities and colleges of student chap-
ters of the parent organization. Under
the enthusiastic sponsorship of Warren
T. McCabe, then Professor of Chemical
Engineering at the University of Mich-
igan, the Alpha Chapter of A. I. Ch. E.
was formed at Ann Arbor in 1922.
Since that time the chapter has been

an integral part of the activities of
Chemical Engineering students at Mich-
igan, by providing an opportunity for
chapter members to meet their fellow
engineers and by broadening the scope
of their training through lectures, plant
trips, and illustrated discussions.
Because of the decreased enrollment
in the Engineering College during the
years 1941-1946, the chapter lapsed in-
to an inactive status. In November,
1945, through the energetic efforts of
Leon Deackoff, class of '47, the chapter
once again became active. ,Under his
leadership as president, a busy year of
evening meetings, plant trips, and
luncheons was brought to a successful
conclusion in June 1946.
New officers elected for the yeai
1946-1947 are president, Floyd W. Pres-
ton; vice presidents. Bill Kiessel and
John M. Thomas; secretary, Lenore Ol-
son; and treasurer, Eleonore Kanar.
An active and expanded program was
anounced at the first meeting October
10 at which Professor George Granger
Brown, Chairman of the Department of
Chemical and Metallurgical Engineering
delivered a timely address entitled,
"The Chemical Engineer in 1947." The
economic security and unlimited oppor-
tunity in a system of free enterprise was
the keynote of his address.
The meeting of October 31, 1946, in-
cluded a most interesting hour of techni-
color sound motion picture on the manu-
facture of molded and laminated plas-
tics. At this meeting two important an-
nouncements were made.
First plans were announced for a
series of seven plant trips to be sched-
uled for the term including firms as the
Dow Chemical Co. at Midland, Wyan-
dotte Chemicals Corp., Sharpies Chem-
icals Co., Goebbels Brewing Co., Socony
Vacuum Oil Refinery, Pennsylvania
Salt Co., and Libby-Owens-Ford Glass
Co.
Second is the scheduling of a chart-
ered bus to the National Convention of
A. I. Ch. E. on November 20, 1946 at
Philadelphia. Prof. R. R. White is to
deliver a short adress on academic
training in the universities and Mr. L.
E. Brownell is to deliver a paper on the
flow of fluids through porous solids. Re-
servations are available for 35 students.
The outstanding meeting of the term
is scheduled for Monday, November 11,
1946. Professor Ralph A. Sawyer, Dean
of the Graduate School and Technical
Adviser to Admiral Blandy for the
Bikini tests, will deliver in Rackham
Lecture Hall an address, "Operation
Crossroads," and he will show a 30-
minute sound, technicolor film of the
two Bikini tests. This is the second
time these pictures have been shown
and promise to be of unusual interest.
The program is under the joint spon-
sorship of the Society of Women Engi-
neers and the University of Michigan
chapter of A. I. Ch. E.
Plans for the future include partic-
ipation in an Engineering Open House
in the spring and a banquet for all chap-
ter members in January.
s.w.e.
The Society of Women Engineers be-
gan their activities for the new school
year with a dinner at the Union on
October 3. The new freshmen were in-
troduced to the old members and to the
guest of honor, Mrs. Dyer, the advisor.
After eating a hearty meal (there was
meat), an informal meeting was held.
Sally Ann Farquhar, president of the
society, expressed the hope that all the
women engineers would benefit from the
opportunities this organization provides.
Ann Lawrence, secretary, outlined the
plans for the year. Meetings will be
held every second Monday in the sem-
inar room of the East Engineering Build-
ing. Arrangements have been made to
present speakers and appropriate movies
at these meetings. Lenore Olson was
elected to serve on the Engineering
Council. Although there are now only
twenty-six women engineers on campus,
the S. W. E. expects this year to be the
most active in their history
The biggest event of the semester will
be a program on the Bikini Atom Bomb
Tests featuring colored sound movies
and a talk by Dean Ralph A. Sawyer.
Dean Sawyer, of the Graduate School,
was technical director of Operations
Crossroads, and adviser to Admiral
Blandy. This program is being pres-
ented November 11, in the Main Lec-
ture Hall of the Horace H. Rackham
Building with the co-sponsorship of the
A. I. Ch. E. Tickets have been distrib-
uted to all the engineering societies.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


NEWS
Harry Pennington,
e#04-'05
While a student in physical chemistry
at the University of Michigan, Harry
Pennington discovered a method of as-
certaining directed control over the pro-
portion of gas produced with oil, the
now well-known "gas-oil ratio" method.
After years of independent operating
and prospecting, Mr. Pennington in
1925 discovered the rich Raccoon Bend
Field in Austin County, Texas, of which
he later sold a portion to the Humble
oil interests. It was here that he was
able to insist that his scheme of limit-
ing oil production be put into force,
and from this beginning the present-
day laws prohibiting the willful wasting
of formation gas have sprung. His
studies in oil and its sources have also
enabled the oil producers of the world
to know more about the thermal and
physical conditions prevailing at great
depths in wells, and have enabled them
to produce larger quantities of liquid
and gaseous fuels without exhausting
our natural resources.
The elimination of waste of formation
gas during production required restric-
tion of daily flow, and was vigorously
opposed initially, but Pennington's
method has upped the known oil re-
serves of this nation by many billions
of barrels. This has been done by re-
coveries ranging now to more than 90%
of the known oil of an oil sand, as
compared with an average of 17% ob-
tained with the prior method of open,
indiscriminate flow. Our known oil re-
serves ranged from four to seven bil-
lions of barrels prior to the adoption of
this concept, but after his rationaliza-
tion before sessions of the Texas Legis-
lature in 1931, and subsequent enact-
ment of national and state legislation
the reserves rose sharply. By 1937 our
reserves had climbed to 12% billion
barrels, and by Pearl Harbor the United
States was able to fight a war, amply
supply its allies, and to keep its popu-
lace on wheels with a reserve of 20%
billion barrels.
In addition to his reforming of waste-
ful production procedures, Mr. Penning-
ton has developed many types of heavy
duty oil-field equipment, and is continu-
ing to develop the mechanisms needed
for greater drilling depths. Among
others of his inventions are various types
of gas rigs, formation testers, pumps,
and special bits for tough rock forma-
tions at great depths. Over a hundred
other items, most of which are covered
by letters patents, are made by large
manufacturers under license, by his own
industries, or in his own mechanical
laboratory for his sole use.

Harry Pennington
During his colorful career, he has
served as field engineer for the Foster-
Wheeler Company, as consulting engi-
neer and chief of mechanical engineer-
ing of the production organization for
the Texas Company, as vice-president
and general manager of the Crude Oil
Marketing Company, and as president
of the Trinity Oil and Refining Com-
pany. During World War I, he was
chief engineer officer of the Texas Na-
tional Guard (36th division) and in
World War II served as a commissioned
officer in the Coast Guard auxiliary on
anti-submarine patrol along the Gulf
Coast. He is a member of the South
Texas Geological Society and the In-
dependent Petroleum Association of
Texas. During World War II he served
as president of "The Sons of the Re-
public of Texas," a patriotic public
service organization.
Charles R. Burrows,
'24e, e.e. '35
Charles R. Burrows, upon his gradu-
ation from the University of Michigan
in 1924 with the degree of B.S.E.E.,
immediately joined the staff of the Bell
Telephone Laboratories as radio re-
search engineer, a post which he held
until very recently. His recent appoint-
ment as director of the Department of
Electrical Engineering at Cornell Uni-
versity comes after over twenty years
of intensive study in the electronics
field. From Columbia University he
received the degree of M.A. in 1924,
and in 1935 he received his E.E. degree
from Michigan. Several years later he
received his Ph.D. degree from Colum-
bia, where he was affiliated with Sigma
Xi.
In the years following his graduation
from the engineering college of Univer-
sity of Michigan Dr. Burrows was a
frequent contributor to the "Proceed-
ings of the Institute of Radio Engi-
neers," "Communications" magazine,
and the "Bell System Technical Jour-
nal." Many of these were reports of
research done by him on ultra-short-
wave propagation, field-strength meas-
urements, transmission-line problems,
and multiplex circuits as used in ultra-
high-frequency radio.
During the period of national emer-
gency he has served on many govern-
mental committees whose purposes were
to investigate new electronic apparatus
and its possible application to the war
effort. Among these assignments were
the chairmanship of the Committee on
Propagation, staff membership at the
Radiation Laboratory of the Massa-
chusetts Institute of Technology, and
membership on the Wave Propagation
committees supporting the Joint Chiefs
of Staff and the Combined Chiefs of
Staff. War projects with which he was
intimately associated include ground re-
search, gun-laying and airborne radar;
radar bomb sights; the proximity fuse;
and counter-measuring instruments.
His professional affiliations include
the American Institute of Electrical
Engineers, the Institute of Radio Engi-
neers, in both of which he holds the
rank of Fellow.

TECHNIC
PRESENTS
m. e. prof
Associate Professor Clarence F. Kess-
ler, of the Mechanical Engineering De-
partment, has had a varied career in
both the collegiate and the industrial
aspects of engineering. He was born
in Sandusky, Ohio, and after graduating
from the high school there, deserted the
Buckeye State for a mechanical engi-
neering course at the University of
Michigan. He first came to Ann Arbor
in 1915 and received a Bachelor of
Science Degree from the University in
1919.
Following graduation Prof. Kessler
accepted a drafting position with the
Perfection Stove Co., and in 1920 trans-
ferred to the Packard Motor Co. and
the Buick Motor Co., where he did
drafting and development work on an
overhead conveyor line used in the mass
production system being improved at
the Flint plant.

Clarence F. Kessler
In the fall of 1920 Prof. Kessler re-
turned to his alma mater as an instruc-
tor in Mechanical Engineering and to
take graduate courses in electrical engi-
neering, with the intention of going into
the municipal power field after getting
a Master's Degree. However, he en-
joyed teaching and the university sur-
roundings so much that after he re-
ceived a Master of Science in Engineer-
ing in 1924 he remained in Ann Arbor.
During the summers he was actively
maintaining his contracts with industry,
working as an engineer for the Detroit
Edison Co. and the Brooklyn Edison
Co. in the electrical field, and also was
associated with the Windsor Trailer Co.,
Economy Baler Co. and Holland, Acker-
man &amp; Holland.
In World War I Prof. Kessler was in
the Navy, and in World War II he was
also connected with this branch of the
service, being Supervisor of the V-12
Program in the Engineering College, in
addition to being coordinator for all
ASTP and ASTPR programs on cam-
pus. In these capacities he assisted the
military authorities in coordinating the
military and academic parts of the pro-
gram, selection of trainees, and correla-
tion of the various courses in the cur-
riculums.
The many and varied jobs which
Prof. Kessler has held in the engineer-
ing field have enabled him to bring the
benefit of his experiences into his teach-
ing. In response to a question of in-
terest to many students thinking about
jobs are his observations on the relative
merits of large and small companies.
The training programs of the large cor-
porations, such as General Electric and
Westinghouse, to mention but two, are
in many ways as valuable as graduate
study at a university, he said. On the
other hand, promotion may come more
rapidly for able men in a small organ-
ization than in a large one.
tau bate
Richard J. Broadman, a native of
New York City, is a twenty-seven-year-
old Engineering senior who will grad-
uate in February. He graduated from
Townsend Harris High School in 1936
and received his Bachelor's degree in
Business Administration from the City
College of New York in 1941.
After his graduation, he went to work
for a cutlery firm and, after learning the
business, was sent to the west coast to
open an office there. Then the war, and
the resultant shortage of steel, forced
his firm to cut down its operations, and
Dick was left with nothing to do and
plenty of time to do it. Never one to
loaf, he went into war work as an in-
spector.
While thus employed, Dick decided
to go into accounting. After attending

MAYBE YOU NEED A PIANO LESSON
When you look inside a piano you see a harp-
shaped metal plate on which the strings are strung.
Even in a spinet it ordinarily weighs well over
100 pounds.
"Too heavy!" thought Winter &amp; Company,
who make pianos. (If you've ever moved a piano,
you'll agree.) "Let's have Alcoa make an alumi-
num plate."
So, Winter's piano designers and Alcoa engineers
put their combined experiences together to de-
velop an aluminum plate. First, a strong alumi-
num alloy had to be found because the strings
put an 18-ton pull on the plate. A special alloy
was produced, but . . .
As the strings don't pull in the same direction or
with the same force, in time the plate would creep,
cause distortion, and the strings get out of tune.
Alcoa engineers found a way to tell exactly
where and how great the strains were . . figured
out how to balance the stresses and then stabilize
the plate by an Alcoa-developed heat-treating
process.
The result: The first successful aluminum piano
plate, weighing only 45 pounds instead of 125,
with tone quality enhanced.
That piano plate offers this lesson for young
engineers to remember when they step from
college into industry: Take a look at aluminum—
with Alcoa engineers at your side—when you
want strength with lightness in anything you are
designing. Ideas click when men with imagination
plus engineering—"Imagineering" as we like to
call it at Alcoa—work with this versatile metal
and with the greatest fund of aluminum knowl-
edge in the world—Alcoa's. Aluminum Company

shock aboard ship
When the Britisfi men-of-war Repulse
and Prince of Wales were attacked by
the Japanese near Malaya on the day
after Pearl Harbor, it was discovered that
direct hits were not needed to put a
heavy fighting ship out of action. The
first bombs dropped by the enemy in
this engagement exploded in the water,
and the force of these underwater ex-
plosions was great enough to actually
"shock" the warships into inactivity.
A ship near such an explosion may
be given an "instantaneous" accelera-
tion of lOOOG's—32,000 feet per second
—for the two micro-seconds' duration
of the underwater compression. The
ship may not move upward more than
an inch, but the speed of the movement
makes it powerful enough to break a
man's ankles. It is this quick jarring
motion that does queer things to the
electrical control system of a battle-

ship. Switches may be closed or opened
.... the radio and radar equipment
may be incapacitated .... but most im-
portant, the fire control system—the
"brains" of the ship's heavy guns—may
be wrecked, making her, literally, a sit-
ting duck for any further attack.
It was this instability of electrical
control equipment, switches and relays,
that set the Navy Department in quest
of controls that were really shock-proof:
controls that "were capable of with-
standing the effects of sudden, mechani-
cal shocks of great magnitude without
being permanently damaged, and in
many cases without even allowing so
much as a momentary interruption of
the circuits being controlled."
Industrial laboratories were told to
recondition the equipment which had
been suitable for industrial use, and
gigantic testing machines were built,
capable of delivering powerful blows to
the part being tested.

Contract Structure for Balanced
Contractor
The first objective of the research
program was to design switches and re-
lays which would sustain no structural
damage when jarred, and the manufac-
turers of insulating materials were
forced to compound new plastic insula-
tors which would not shatter under test.
Metal parts can always be made big-
ger and heavier, but insulators had to
be shatter-proof.
The second problem was that of
"positive action"—switches that stay
open or stay closed under severe shock
conditions. How about springs and
shock-absorbers? Right! Particularly
in the mountings of control boxes and
panels, where many controls may be
protected by the resilience of the mount-
ing. Inertia interlocks were also used to
some extent—weights which would not
allow the switch to be opened or closed
quickly—but these were found to be
clumsy, and were discarded in favor of
the application of the principles of
static equilibrium, balancing all parts
of the switch about its axis of move-
ment, so that shock simply moved the
entire instrument, and did not tend to
change its setting.

Unbalanced Magnet Clappers
The best means of combatting the
effects of sudden shock, however, was
found to be "positive locking" or wedg-
ing of the switch in each position, with
locking devices or by cam operation of
the controls. Shocks do not tend to turn
a properly balanced cam about its
axis, and this method was used on many
of the Navy's smaller vessels, which ran
the risk of being jolted by the very
depth charges they dropped against
enemy submarines.
While the results of this intensive
wartime research program will not be
generally useful to industry, the lessons
learned here concerning balancing and
positive locking of electrical controls
will undoubtedly find many applications
in the fields of air and rail, as well as
marine transportation.

CHNIC
FLECTS
Editor's Note: The following story
has been compiled from the statements
of witnesses and from a grimy, blood-
soaked parchment found in the hand of
one of the TECHNICS foremost staff
members. Horrifying screams and
groans attracted bystanders to the En-
gineering Arch last Friday night, where
they discovered the gory pulp of Amb-
rose McHigan surrounded by a horde of
irate university women.
The prompt intervention of six mem-
bers of the football team together with
a sixty-four gallon blood transfusion
administered at University Hospital are
credited with miraculously saving the
TECHNICS comic writer from an ex-
ceedingly painful death. It is estimated
that over fifteen pounds of salt had been
poured over McHigan's lacerated torso
by his assailants in their demonic rage.
Many of the participants in the crime
were apprehended by local authorities.
The TECHNIC withholds the names of
all implicated persons because of the
nature of the case. It is expected that
the University will take immediate steps
to prevent recurrence of the incident. It
is also rumored that salt will be banned
from the tables of all sororities, the
League, and all girl's dormitories.

Pinch-hitting for McHigan during his
present illness, I might say at the outset
that he was the "salt of the earth" where
the TECHNIC was concerned, and is
even more so now that his ionization
product constant has been so drastically
increased. He told me later at the hos-
pital, quoting his Grecian authorities
again, that he would have been "beta off
daid," and I'm inclined to agree with
him.
Once again applying the perpetual
and mystic powers of my Great Aunt
Ambrosia McHigan's mirror in a reflec-
tive manner, I might begin this, my
um-de-umth year's first "REFLECTS"
with the usual male observations on
"how well stocked Stock well is stocked
with well-stacked stock" this fall. Say-
ing that three times fast, I always end
up with "well stocked stack," and truth-
fully some of 'dese babes' are built like
stocky stacks—small and large smoke
stacks, minus the smoke, of course.
Why no smoke? No doubt a few of
you will recall the ancient Phlogistic
Theory which read something like this
when translated from the original
Greek: ". . . . Alpha Chi Omega ....
Kappa Delt . . . ."—yup, here it is.

"Where there's smoke, there's fire, and
where there's fire, there's heat." Now
in my expert opinion our present supply
of co-eds just ain't so hot—on the aver-
age, that is—or at least they weren't
until this "REFLECTS" got into print.
Perhaps a few are smoking now, but—
oh, well, stunting their growth can't
hurt much.
Naturally not a single co-ed can com-
plain about this frank opinion (nor can
a married one, for that matter), since to
do so would indicate that she considered
herself just one of the lowly average.
C. H. Griffitts, professor of psychology
here at the University, will tell you that
each woman believes she, herself, to be
the most beautiful 'femme' in creation,
with the exception of a few minor de-
tails such as a beastly pan, square legs,
and too much makeup.
*(Mable, you shouldn't be reading
over my shoulder. It isn't polite. If
you don't stop bothering me, I'll
never get this "REFLECTS" writ-
ten.)
But just the same we love you, goils,
or with you, as the case (objective) or
place (Arboretum) may be.
*(Mable, what are you girls going
to do with all those beer bottles?)
Now when I was a freshman back
in . . .
*(Mable, why are you smashing
those bottles. You're gonna' cut
somebody if you ain't careful. Not
only that, I got to collect the de-
posit.)
... '96 I believe it was, we really
had campus queens who . . .
*(Mable, put down those bottles—
NO, NO. I wasn't writing about you
—you don't have buck teeth—Ma-
—ble, DON'T. MY GOD! NOO-
ooooo thud.)

Much has been said concerning the
ratio of men to women on campus these
past few months, and with more GI's
pouring in each additional semester,
obviously the limit of 'y' equals a func-
tion of 'x,' as 'x' approaches infinity, is
remarkable.
Without numerically evaluating the
discouraging facts, we can see that even
the most optimistic extrapolation of the
curve, fudging all we can, leaves the
University with practically no sweet
smelling femme's and too many smellers
to sniff at them.
Furthermore, the laws of probability
predict that soon, in all probability, it
will be extremely rare that we will see
a woman on campus. About that time
McHigan will be trying to date one of
his 'Stockwell chimneys,' and she will
blow smoke in his face with a "remem-
ber what you said about my figure"
theme.
Perhaps I had better amble over to
the hospital to see how McHigan is
making out with his nurses. He always
was a ladies' man and I know he will be
getting a box of candy from each of
them. The only problem remaining will
be a qualitative separation of the cocoa-
nut creams from the arsenic chocolates.

The disiloxanes were of no interest

silicon-to-oxygen bond is very strong,

At high temperature, liquid silicones are more heat resistant than petroleum oils.
field of possibilities. Varying the R
groups, the percentages of the silanediol
and silanetriol condensed together, the
amount of disiloxane, the activating
temperature, and other factors, all re-
sulted in a series of high polymers with
properties entirely different from those
of organic compounds. Some research
was also carried out on the di-and
trisilicon halides, but treatment with the
Grignard reagents was difficult, and the
resulting Si-Si bond did not have the
stability of the Si-O-Si bond.
The results of these syntheses indi-
cated that silicones may be roughly
catalogued into three broad divisions;
resins, liquids, and rubber. Two basic
properties are inherent in all, tempera-
ture stability and water resistance. The
silicone presents towards water a hydro-
carbon surface similar to water-repellent
paraffins and oils.
The resins are long-chain polymers,
with or without extensive cross-bridg-
ing, formed by the polysiloxanes or
polysilsesquioxanes. Some SiCl&lt; may be
added to the original mixture in order
to form a silicious glass-like lattice-work
in which the arylated silanols are bound
on hydrolysis. For example, a British
concern describes mixing a 1:1 solution
of Me2SiClo and Me3 SiCl with SiCl4 in
ether and pouring the mixture into ice-
water. The ether layer is evaporated
leaving a colorless, transparent resin.
The Corning Glass Co. soon devel-
oped numerous silicones which could be
applied to Fiberglas as a waterproofing
material. A resin of particular import-
ance is formed by properly mixing the
dichloro and trichloro compounds (with-
out any SiCl) and hydrolyzing, taking
care that condensation is kept at a mini-
mum. The mixture of silanols is dis-
solved in toluene to a varnish-like con-
sistency, an accelerator added, and then
applied to pieces of Fiberglas, placed in
a mold and subjected to heat and pres-
sure until final condensation (curing)
takes place. (Great care must be exer-
cised in the selection of the accelerator
since some cause the formation of a gel
which will not flow in the mold, result-
ing in brittle bonding.) The resulting
material makes an excellent flexible in-
sulator. A great many materials (mica,
asbestos, etc.) can be bonded together
by silicon resins in this manner.
The silicone liquids are clear, water-
white fluids with few crossbridges. Vis-
cosity is controlled by the length of the
molecule, and the range of viscosity
runs from that of water to that of tar.
These fluids are extremely heat resist-
ant, have a very low temperature co-
efficient of viscosity, and have widely
separated boiling and freezing points.
For example, a type of lubricant de-
veloped by Dow-Corning freezes at
—12S°F. and boils at 300°F., and has
the same viscosity as water.
The uses of these liquids are numer-
ous; low and high temperature hydraulic
fluids, damping fluids for precision
gauges and dashpots, temperature baths,
heat transfer fluids, and as a water re-
pellent coating for glass and ceramic
articles are just a few. Some liquids
such as lubricating oils, tend to foam
badly, a decidedly annoyance in Diesel
engine recirculating systems; a few
drops of silicone liquid will prevent this
foaming. Vacuum pumps requiring non-
volatile lubricants under reduced pres-
sures will find silicone fluids ideal.
An offshoot of the silicone fluid family
is the group of silicone greases and
pastes. By proper processing the liquid
can be altered to give it the consistency
of petrolatum. This grease maintains its
consistency throughout the range of
temperature from 40 degrees F. below
zero to 400 degrees above, a property
which makes this grease desirable in ap-
plications where the temperature varies
widely.

type, is finding increasing application
also. Although the exact composition of
this type is a carefully guarded secret
of the companies producing it, it prob-
ably lies somewhere between the silicone
liquids and resines. They are thermally
stable up to 150°—200°C. and retain
their elasticity from well below 0°C. to
higher than 17S°C. Gaskets made of
silicone rubber with an inorganic filler
have been developed by General Electric
for marine carbon arc searchlights to fill
specifications for places where before
only metal to metal, non-waterproof
joints would stand the temperature gra-
dient. Insulating tape, vibration moun-
tings, and applications requiring an elas-
tic material which does not swell in oil
or gasoline are all possible uses of this
type of silicone.
Silicone rubber is not as yet a general

ber, and may never be. Its abrasion,

done. Until about a year ago, all of the
silanols had to be prepared by means of
the Grignard reaction, an expensive
process because of the metallic magne-
sium involved. E. G. Rochow, of the
General Electric Co., discovered that the
substituted halosilanes could be pre-
pared directly by passing the alkyl or
aryl chlorides over pure silicon in the
presence of a catalyst at about 300°.
(Usually the dihalosilane was formed,
about 70% of the total products.) Cop-
per seems to be the best catalyst for
the alkyl chlorides and silver the best
for the aryl chlorides. This discovery
will reduce the cost of the silicones, the
principal disadvantage heretofore, by
eliminating the costly Grignard reagent.
Furthermore, the extensive research of
the Dow-Corning Co. and General Elec-
tric seems to indicate that the only ab-
solutely necessary UR" groups in the
silicones are methyl and phenyl; proper
combinations of these two groups in the
substituted silanols can give any prop-
erty that substitution of pure ethyl,
butyl, propyl, or naphthyl groups would
give.

in most respects to organic chemistry,
there are literally millions of silicon
compounds yet to be discovered. Some
of these will be useless as far as civiliza-
tion goes, some will be only laboratory
curiosities like "bouncing putty," but
there are still many modifications of sili-
cone resins, liquids, and rubbers which
may very probably fill a long standing
need in the industries of today. All of
the raw materials of the silicones are
cheap; sand, water, chlorine, and or-
ganic liquids: there but remains the dis-
covering of cheap economical ways of
building up the silicon polymers from
these building blocks.
Certain problems of processing the
silicones are still to be solved. The res-
ins, although capable of forming a very
high strength bond when used on glass
or ceramic articles, do not show this
strength when bonded to non-silicious
materials. Nor can they yet be molded
with any degree of ease. Two types of
resins have been developed as vehicles

suitable only for light bearing loads,
causing very excessive wear when the
bearing load exceeds a certain critical
value. Application of the fluids as wa-
terproofing media to articles such as
leather and organic textiles must under-
go many tests before adequacy, perma-
nency, and practicality are proved.
As mentioned before, the third class
of polymer, the silicone rubbers, are
superior to natural and synthetic rub-
bers only in retention of elasticity over
a large temperature range and a high
resistance to thermal decomposition. In-
corporation of suitable fillers or perhaps
and as yet undiscovered, modified ar-
rangement of the atoms in the chain
polymer will increase the abrasion and
tensile properties to the point where the
silicones can compete with the other rub-
bers.
While silicones are much like a newly
discovered land, there is an important
difference. Any geographical discovery
has definite limits which are soon
charted and mapped; the silicones re-
present a virtually limitless field, infin-
ite in variety. Years will be required
just to explore the most useful compo-
nents in this group.

NOW READY- New and enlarged edition
"REFERENCE DATA for RADIO ENGINEERS"
Compiled especially for Radio Engineers,
Students of Engineering, Educators, Electronic
Technicians, Radio Amateurs, Inventors.
The second edition of this widely accepted pocket-size hand-
book . . . revised and enlarged . . . now includes important
radio technical data developed during the war.
Compiled jointly by the physicists and electronic specialists
of the Federal Telecommunication Laboratories and the
International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation, the
material in this new book has behind it the technical authority
of an organization with international leadership in radio,
communications and television.
Enlarged from 200 to 336 pages with over 400 charts and
diagrams, it makes available quickly the answers to problems
that normally arise in practical radio work. This ready refer-
ence feature is one reason why Reference Data for Radio
Engineers, in its earlier edition, received such an enthusiastic
welcome by electronic specialists. Orders totaled more than
50,000 copies. With the wealth of new material now included,
the second edition can be of even greater aid to the practicing
radio engineer.
Commenting on the first edition, Walter J. Seeley, Chair-
man, Department of Electrical Engineering, Duke University,
wrote enthusiastically:
"It is so chock full of useful data that I am urging all students
to purchase their own personal copies . . . fills a long-felt need
for a convenient compilation of both mathematical and engi-
neering data, and the combination will be appreciated by all
who have to work with radio circuits and their concomitant
mathematics. That applies especially to teachers and students
and I should not be surprised if it becomes a must in many
college courses.*9

The elimination of therbligs from an

A motion picture film strip of the
hand motions involved in carrying out
one complete cycle of a bolt and washer
assembly by the old method was brought

Be prepared to grasp every opportunity that comes your
way after graduation and to make the most of it.
Have all the answers at your command
—including those pertaining to bear-
ings; for bearings figure importantly in
every engineering problem wherever
wheels and shafts turn.
In fact many an otherwise soundly-
designed machine has failed to perform
up to expectations because its bearings
were not equal to the tasks imposed
on them.
A thorough knowledge of Timken
Tapered Roller Bearings will enable you
to fully satisfy the bearing requirement
in almost every kind of machinery and
thus avoid troubles due to inadequate
bearing equipment.
Timken Bearings are the first choice of
an overwhelming majority of experi-

cost of labor involved in the manufac-
ture of marketable items, through the
reduction of the time required by each
worker to complete his task. Thus the
employer is directly benefited by motion
study through reduction of labor costs.
But how is the worker himself affected?
It can be seen at once that his job
is made easier for him through improved
work methods, and other related fac-
tors. His morale is higher because he is
aware of his increased efficiency. Most
important of all, however, could be the
monetary reward awaiting him in the
form of a possible wage incentive plan
based on motion and time study stand-
ards. A carefully worked out plan of
this type will insure that the average
worker can make his bonus by putting a
little extra effort into his job. The same
plan that will enable the worker to take
home a larger paycheck through in-
creased production will save his em-
ployer money by distributing the fixed
costs of manufacture over a larger num-
ber of units, thus lowering the cost per
unit.
A part of this saving will often be
passed on to the general public. Thus
the influence of motion study on modern
production can indirectly have a highly
desirable influence on the lives of you
and your fellow Americans.
Every inch an industrial worker
moves his hands in performing a task
costs his employer money. Recently an
industrial engineer with a sense of the
dramatic made the startling announce-
ment that daily in American industry
there are more than 200,000,000 manual
motions! In a year's time the hands of
the average worker travel over 5000
miles a distance equal to a return trip
across the Atlantic, or one-fifth of the
way around the globe!
The staggering financial burden of
material movement and manual motions
in production must be borne by the na-
tion's industry. It is apparent that dol-
lars are saved wherever management is
able to make a cut in the number or
complexities of manual motions required
for a given production output. When
such savings can be made on a large
scale it is profitable to hire qualified
specialists on a full-time basis to study
workers and production layouts in a
plant with the aim of accomplishing
mass motion simplification.

Tele ran-* radio eyes"for blind flying!
It's a television "information please" be-
tween airplane and airport—with the pilot's
questions given split-second answers on a
television screen mounted in the cockpit.
Teleran (a contraction of TELEvision—
Radar Air Navigation) collects all of the
necessary information on the ground by
radar, and then instantly transmits a tele-
vision picture of the assembled data to the
pilot aloft in the airplane.
On his receiver the pilot sees a picture
showing the position of his airplane and the
position of all other aircraft near his alti-
tude, superimposed upon a terrain map
complete with route markings, weather
conditions and unmistakable visual instruc-
tions. The complex problem of air traffic
control is well handled by Teleran.
Teleran—another achievement of RCA—
is being developed with Army Air Forces
co-operation by RCA Laboratories and RCA
Victor, endless sources of history-making
developments in radio and electronics.

PROBLEM — You're designing a radio broadcast transmitter. The circuit
includes condensers and other variable elements which must be ad-
justed by the operator. You want to place these elements for optimum
circuit efficiency and where they will be easy to assemble, wire, and
service. At the same time, you want to centralize the control knobs at a
point convenient to the operator. How would you do it?
THE SIMPLE ANSWER
Use S.S.White remote control type
flexible shafts to couple the variable
elements to their control knobs. This
leaves you free to place both the
elements and the knobs anywhere you
want them. And you get control that is
as smooth and sensitive as a direct
connection because S.S.White remote
control flexible shafts are engineered
expressly for this kind of service.
• • •
This is just one of hundreds of remote
control and power drive problems to
which S.S.White flexible shafts pro-
vide a simple answer. That's why every
engineer should be familiar with the
range and scope of these "Metal
Muscles" for mechanical bodies.

That tall blond lad you've seen haunt-
ing the sacred halls of the West Engi-
neering Building lately, is Pittsburgh's
pride and joy. James A. Richardson is
one of the top seniors in Industrial-
Mechanical Engineering.
Back in the mid-3 O's, Jim extracted
his algebra and history from Aspinwald
High School, and on graduation, at-
tended the University of Pittsburgh for
two years before enlisting in the Navy
in 1940. After three years of naval life,
the admiral decided Jim might like a
rest, so he was shipped here for V-12
training in November, 1943. Whether
it was a "rest" or not, Jim wasn't quite
sure! Last February he received his
commission, and then returned to Mich-
igan to complete his engineering train-
ing.

Before graduating next February,
Rich is flipping Canadian pennies to
determine whether he'll enter the Law
school, or continue in engineering as a
grad student.
Besides his school work Rich has
found time to do a little outside work,
having been president of Lambda Chi-
Alpha for three semesters, and currently
holding down the post of president of
those rare phenomena, the Tau-Bates.
One of Jim's main jobs this fall is pub-
licizing the Tau Beta Pi chapter here,
and trying to convince the rest of us
engineers that membership isn't as in-
accessible as everyone thinks.

closed in a cylinder. The pressure of
the atmosphere on the opposite side
moves the piston and thus exerts a pull
on connectors linking it with the brak-
ing mechanism. Vacuum brakes are
used on light trucks and busses up to
around 2^ tons capacity. Heavier
trucks and busses require more braking
power and this is obtained by means of
compressed air.
The automotive air brake is a direct
lineal descendant of the railroad air
brake that first brought fame to George
Westinghouse. Inasmuch as compressed
air had been found to be the best oper-
ating medium for railroad brakes, it was
only natural that it should be applied
to motor vehicles.
Strictly speaking, the first automotive
brakes utilized a mixture of air and
gasoline vapors, for the cars own en-
gine served as the compressor. Some
of the gaseous charge was bled off from
one or more of the cylinders toward the
end of the compression stroke and stored
under pressure to be drawn upon as
required.
THE TECHNIC EXPLORES
(Continued from page 18)
The basic principle of the original air-
brake system is still retained, but there
have naturally been many additions, re-
finements, and improvements to keep
pace with the steady development and
increasing carry capacity of heavy-duty
motor vehicles. One of the early major
changes was the substitution of com-
pressed air for the engine gases. This
came about with the introduction of a
small compressor that could be driven
by the vehicle's engine. During the in-
tervening years, compressed air has
come into service on trucks and busses
for purposes other than braking. These
developments, plus the need for progres-
sively more braking power for the safe
control of larger and larger vehicles,
have demanded compressors of addi-
tional sizes, and they are now built in
three sizes.
In its simplest form, the air-brake
system consists of a compressor, air-
distribution lines, governor, pressure
gauge, safety valve, reservoir, brake
valve, and brake chambers. Compressed
air is conveyed through copper tubing
to a storage reservoir from which it is
withdrawn as needed to apply the
brakes, which are operated by a treadle
valve that looks and functions much the
same as the conventional foot acceler-
ator or pedal such as is used in actu-
ating mechanical brakes.
When a driver depresses the pedal,
air is admitted to the lines supplying
the braking devices. This is accom-
plished through the action of the brake
valve which has an intake and an ex-
haust section. The intake is normally
closed, preventing the "pressurized" air
from going beyond that point. The ex-
haust valve is normally open, thus mak-
ing sure that there is no pressure in the
lines extending to the braking elements.
When the pedal is depressed the intake
is opened, the exhaust is closed, and
compressed air immediately flows to
the braking devices. When the pedal is
released, this sequence is reversed—the
compressed air in the afterpart of the
system is exhausted to the atmosphere
and the pressure is again confined to the
forepart.

Low-Cost Sulfamic Acid Was Result
of Newly Discovered Process
Once obscure laboratory
chemical now finding
wide use in industry
Sulfamic acid, which for
years was merely another
obscure laboratory chemical,
is today being produced in
carload quantities for a con-
stantly growing list of uses
because of a discovery
made by a Du Pont chemist.
Believing that urea could
be sulfonated to give a prod-
uct which might have com-
mercial utility, the chemist
treated urea with fuming
sulfuric acid. The reaction
was exceedingly violent, and
it appeared that decomposi-
tion had taken place to give ordi-
nary ammonium sulfate. However,
the chemist noted that the white
precipitate which had formed did
not dissolve rapidly in water as am-
monium sulfate should, and further
investigation proved that he had
obtained sulfamic acid.

Crystals of sulfamic acid
scarcely known chemical, and an in-
tensive study of its chemical and
physical properties has led to its
development for a wide variety of
industrial uses.
First Industrial Applications
The salts of sulfamic acid are being
used extensively as flame-proofing
agents. Highly compatible with cellu-
lose, ammonium sulfamate is unique
among fire retardants in that it does
not cause stiffening or otherwise ad-
versely affect the hand or feel of
textiles and paper.
Another outstanding use for am-
monium sulfamate is as a weed killer
for the control of poison ivy, rag-
weed, and a variety of noxious an-
nuals. Its effect on poison ivy is un-
matched by any other product.
One of the most important indus-
trial applications for sulfamic acid is
based on the fact that it reacts quan-
titatively and very rapidly with ni-
trous acid. This has led to its wide
use in eliminating the excess nitrite
employed in diazotization reactions

manufacture.
Soluble in Water and
Non-hygroscopic
Sulfamic acid is a strong acid,
and despite the fact that it
is exceedingly soluble in wa-
ter, it is a solid non-hygro-
scopic, non-volatile material
which has found application
as a laboratory titrimetric
standard. Additional infor-
mation will be found in the
bulletin "Sulfamic Acid and
Its Salts." Write to 2521 Ne-
mours Bldg., Wilmington,

Understandably, men of
Du Pont are proud that their work
in the laboratory has created and
developed many products like this
"chemical curiosity" to help make
life safer, more pleasant and com-
fortable for all Americans.
Questions College Men ask
about working with Du Pont
IS THERE A FUTURE
FOR ME AT DU PONT?
Every effort is made to initially select
graduates for a specific job in line with
their training and expressed preferences.
Men are advanced as rapidly as their
capabilities permit and openings occur.
The broad research program and the
ever expanding development of new
chemical products as well as the growth
of old established products offer ample
opportunities for the technical graduate
to grow in the organization.

Actual application of the brake is
made by the brake chamber, the con-
struction of which is shown in an accom-
panying illustration. Pressure of com-
pressed air upon a diaphragm serves to
move the latter forward and with it a
push rod, the outer end of which is
connected to the wheel brake by means
of an arm known as a slack adjuster.
Movement of this slack adjuster rotates
a cam and thus forces the brake shoes
against the brake drums. When the air
pressure is exhausted, springs acting on
the brake-shoe cam and one in the brake
chamber return all the moving elements
to their original positions, releasing the
brake.
The equipment just enumerated con-
stitutes the standard brake system for
the safe operation of an ordinary truck
of small or medium size. Various addi-
tional devices are either desirable or
necessary for larger trucks and busses
and for tractor-trailer units. Even when
they are employed, however, the funda-
mental operating principle remains the
same as that outlined. In most cases
there are two interconnected air storage
reservoirs. This arrangement not only
adds reserve power but also permits the
first receiver to trap moisture, which
condenses and can be periodically

WHAT'S INSIDE
HOOVER'S
ENGINEERING
DEPARTMENT?
There's more engineering to the job
of staying in first plaee with any
home appliance than meets the eye
... so we've cross-sectioned the
Hoover Engineering Department's
modern 4-story building to show you.
It's "big-time" engineering.
More than 130 skilled people, a
third of them graduate engineers,
staff this Hoover "idea factory." We
call it that because in doing a thor-
ough job of planning and proving
the Hoover Cleaner, Hoover engi-
neers come up with developments,
new ideas that find wide application
in other industries—many of them
far removed from the home appli-
ance field.

drained off by opening a petcock at the
bottom. Supplementary devices often
used on trucks and busses are: a low-
pressure indicator, an air-supply valve,
a relay valve, a quick-release valve, a
stop-light switch, and a limiting valve.
The low-pressure indicator automatic-
ally causes a warning mechanism to
function when the reservoir pressure is
less than the effective minimum for con-
tinuous brake operation. Th? air-sup-
ply valve, interposed in the line between
the compressor and the governor, per-
mits air to be withdrawn for emergency
tire inflation and other purposes and
causes the compressor to run all the
while the air is being used.
The relay valve speeds up the opera-
tion of the rear brake chambers. As
it is actuated by only a small amount
of air admitted from the brake valve,
it functions when the brake pedal is
depressed but slightly. In turn, the
relay valve admits a greater volume of
air from a reservoir into the lines feed-
ing the rear brake chambers. It also
speeds up the release of the brakes by
causing the air in them to be discharged
directly to the atmosphere instead of
following the normal and more cir-
cuitous route through the brake valve.
printed radio circuits
In their efforts to offset rising labor
and material costs, the electronic indus-
tries are adopting novel designing and
manufacturing schemes. Perhaps the
most unusual of these is a method for
"printing" complete electronic circuits
on chasses of plastics or ceramics. A
large part of the cost of electronic
equipment comes from the antiquated
hand-wiring which has persisted since
the inception of the industry.
In one method silver paint is applied
through a stencil which has been de-
signed to connect all of the circuit com-
ponents by thin bands of metallic sil-
ver. The plastic chassis is covered by
a mask having cut-outs corresponding
to the desired conducting paths. Then
a spray from a metallizing machine
passes through these cutouts and lodges
in the shallow grooves which have been
sandblasted in the plastic. By this
means the necessity of cutting all wire
leads to the exact length required is
eliminated and the circuit components
may be connected directly to the metal-
lic conducting channels.
A variation of this method involves
the photo-deposition of metallic silver
on a silk screen to form a photographic
negative. When the screen is developed,
the unreduced silver salts are washed
away and a stencil remains which is an
exact copy of the desired circuit. The
circuit to be printed is photographed
and a "positive'' made. This positive
is then placed against the silk screen
and action of light causes the deposi-
tion. Then the screen is placed against
the ceramic surface and silver paste is
swabbed across it, causing lines to be
formed on the ceramic. The chassis is
then baked at approximately 1400 de-
grees Fahrenheit.
Even more time-saving is the appli-
cation of a carbon-resin mixture through
a different stencil to form the myriad
values of resistors need in today's ap-
paratus. New capacitors with extremely
small physical size and excellent stabil-
ity are used in conjunction with vacuum
tubes of tremendously reduced size,
both of which are the result of intensive
wartime research.
LOOK TO STEAM FOR PROGRESS
. . . AND CAREERS

I ODAY the American way of life literally runs on steam. Most of the
power that generates our electricity, drives our railroads and propels our
ships, is supplied by steam. And from steam conies power and heat for
producing most of our necessities, comforts and luxuries.
As synonymous as Steam is with Progress, so B&amp;W is with Steam. For
over 60 years, B&amp;W has been designing and building steam generating
equipment for industries and public utilities in this country and abroad,
and for American naval and merchant fleets that circle the globe. It has
maintained leadership in its field through constant development and
research and through the production of equipment that sets high stand-
ards for quality.
This policy of continued pioneering opens many career opportunities
to graduating technical students; careers in diversified, expanding fields
of manufacturing, engineering, research, sales, and other activities. B&amp;W
will be glad to send you the booklet "Your Career" presenting the story
of the Babcock &amp; Wilcox Company in terms of your future.

... a great name in research with a big future in CHEMISTRY
SILICONE CHEMISTRY
The Opening of a New Frontier
Organosilicon chemistry has gone
to work. A little-known and sparsely
investigated field for 40 years, or-
ganosilicon chemistry now offers
g^ tremendous oppor-
1*1% tunities for explora-
/ tion. The silicones,
o i «» r\ but one corner of this
/ field, have already
C ff proved themselves in
the years of war.
In 1942, after four years of in-
tensive research, General Electric
built a pilot plant for the produc-
tion of a number of silicone prod-
ucts. Based on new chemical reac-
tions, this plant operated under
wartime secrecy to produce silicones
for jobs no other materials could do.
There is new mastery over heat,
cold, and moisture in the man-made
silicone molecule. Its tough back-
bone of silicon and oxygen gives
stability and endurance. Its carbon
and hydrogen lend versatility and
variety to the numerous new kinds
of molecules. Silicones are some-
thing new under the sun.

Dri-Film is the
patented name for a
number of G-E Sili-
cone water repellents
that vary according
to their application
to ceramics, plas-
tics, textiles, and other materials.
A coating of transparent Dri-Film,
invisible with a microscope, is
durable enough to shed water for
years at a time. Dri-Film was used
to treat paper gas mask filters . . .
naval binoculars ... tank periscopes.
Some foreseeable Dri-Film possi-
bilities are: treatment for bathroom
tile and porcelain . . . better electron
tube performance in vest pocket
radios and hearing aids . . . shower-
proof clothing that looks and feels
like ordinary clothing ... drier trout
dry flies. . . paper plates for serving
hot food.
Closer to the ideal insulation
G-E Silicone Resin Varnishes,
used with glass fiber approach the
long-sought-for ideal insulation. It's

now possible to de-
sign a given power
rating into electri-
cal apparatus with
less insulation—and save up to 40
per cent in its weight and bulk.
Think what such savings in weight
and bulk will mean in future elec-
trical apparatus!
Lubrication comes from sand
Silicone oils offer previously un-
heard-of viscosity constancy over a
wide temperature range they are
chemically inert . . . they can be
made rust-inhibitive . .. they won't

more compact, trouble-free hydrau-
lic systems and pumps which will be
sealed permanently by the manufac-
turer.
The Chemical Department of
General Electric—a great new name
in chemistry—is turning up more
new and amazing silicone possibil-
ities every day. A new G-E plant
for commercial silicone production
now is being built at Waterford,
New York. Soon, many tested G-E
Silicone products will be available
to industry. For Silicone informa-
tion, write to the Chemical Depart-
ment, General Electric Company,

DR. IRVING LANGMUIR
Associate Director, G-E Research Laboratory,
Winner of Nobel Prize in Chemistry
There will always be new frontiers of science. Opening up right
now at General Electric is the broad frontier of organosilicon
chemistry. Scientific research and product development in this
fascinating field challenge the young chemist. And the building
of a whole new chemical industry offers splendid opportunities
to the ambitious chemical engineer.

Many centuries ago the weight of one last straw
broke a camel's back. Thus somebody's artless
optimism about the strength of a vital part wrecked
a perfectly good materials handling system.
Today it is plain, cold fact that ignoring the
depressing effect of low temperatures on the im-
pact strength of vital steel parts can be a short
cut to a long line of avoidable, costly troubles.
The solution for the problem in the fable was
less load or more camel. For the modern problem
the answer is a molybdenum steel that combines
the deep hardening and freedom from temper
brittleness necessary to provide good low tem-
perature impact strength.

Judging from the developments that are being made by science in this atomic age,
one is tempted to believe that anything can happen, even miracles. However, that isn't
the answer. These developments are the results of long periods of intensive research by
men who have devoted years to work and study along specified lines, and often a suc-
cessful solution is reached only after repeated failures.
We have many such men at the University of Michigan available through research
facilities, and they are constantly undertaking new problems. These problems are sub-
mitted to us by firms of all kinds, from all parts of the country, and include research
on innumerable items from utilization of wood to nuclear physics.
If you have any such problems, no matter how small or how large, we would be
very glad to help you solve them. Call us, or write.

stratovision:
Economically practical television and
FM radio service has moved a step
nearer realization. Covered in a report
concerning Stratovision, the new system
of airborne television and FM transmis-
sion are data compiled in a-series of
tests begun last December.
Although tests are far from complete,
information obtained to date more than
verifies all of the optimistic estimates of
Stratovision possibilities made when the
system was announced last August. Us-
able signals have been transmitted over
a distance of 240 airline-miles from an
altitude of 25,000 feet using only 250
watts of power.
Transmission characteristics of both
television and FM have been studied
during flight tests. Television work has
centered around the problem of "ghost-
ing," the annoying out-of-register receiv-
ing which occurs when a receiver picks
up a signal by two different wave paths
—one in direct line from the transmit-
ting antenna, the other by reflection
from some intervening object.
Transmissions to date have been on
three frequencies between 100 and 550
megacycles with one channel devoted to
studies of television '"ghosting," another
to FM transmission, and the third for
communications incident to test opera-
tion.
First tests have been flown over a
fixed course from the Martin Airport
over Wilmington, Philadelphia, and
New York City to New Haven and re-
turn.
Three Stratovision antenna systems
are required on the plane in addition to
those serving its normal radio operation-
al requirements. One—a 10 foot alumi-
num tubing mast—is hinged in the bomb
bay and lowered into place after the
take-off. This is the rebroadcast anten-
na which sends programs, received in
the plane from ground stations, back to
earth over a greatly increased range.
A second underside antenna picks up
programs from the ground station for
rebroadcast; while a third, on the top
of the plane, provides the communica-
tion channel. The ground station em-
ploys two antennas mounted on a single
50 foot mast for FM tests and commu-
nication and three additional antennas
for television studies.
talking lamp
Existence of a "talking lamp," which
emits infra-red radiations enabling se-
cret two-way conversation over an invis-
ible searchlight beam, has been an-
nounced recently.
The source of the unseen radiations
is caesium vapor. Although an efficient
generator of infra-red rays caesium is a
poor visible illuminant, thereby qualify-
ing it for confidential telephonic assign-
ments. It is possible to transmit words
practically instantaneously with true
telephone quality and at normal conver-
sational speed with this lamp.
The caesium vapor lamp was de-
signed at the request of the United
States Navy for convoy duty and for
issuing troop landing directions. A fea-
ture particularly attractive to the Navy
is that, unlike radio, there can be no
eavesdropping or jamming of infra-red
"beamcasting." Jamming would require
the use of a "shutter" device within the
limited 25-degree beam, as the message
is restricted to listeners therein.

The Electrical Laboratory designs, tests and redesigns
motors and component parts in developing power plants
for Hoover Cleaners.

The Testing Laboratory maintains production control
by acceptance tests on parts and materials. Test specifi-
cations and special test apparatus are developed here.

Filters, fans, materials, processes are tested in the
Mechanical Laboratory; air flow and power problems,
cleaners and cleaning methods are studied.


In this modern, fully equipped laboratory exhaustive
chemical and metallurgical tests are conducted on metal,
fabric, wood, paper and plastics.
A 50-ton room supported on numerous steel springs
affords perfect acoustical isolation, insuring precision
measurement on noise and vibration problems.
Building the world's largest-selling electric cleaner is big-time engi-
neering, and many thousands of hours of design, tests, research and
study go into constructing each new cleaner model.
The Hoover Engineering Department is recognized as a leader. Hoover
engineering problems call for the full range of engineering skills—and
the best in both equipment and personnel is necessary to handle them.

The lamp itself serves as the trans-
mitter. When mounted on a ship's mast
in a parabolic searchlight-like reflector,
it picks up words spoken into a micro-
phone from the ship's pilothouse or deck
and provides wings for the voice to
reach the receiving station on another
ship or shore station. At the receiving
station, a photoelectric cell mounted in
another parabolic reflector picks up the
infra-red rays, and with suitable ampli-
fication converts them to spoken words.
The key to broadcasting with light
beams is the ability of the lamps to
alternately dim and brighten thousands
of times a second, a requirement neces-
sary due to similar frequencies in the
human voice. On this modulability the
caesium vapor lamp has a maximum
efficiency.
dnieper dam:
Last of three hydro-electric generator

nearing completion here in America. The
Russians already have received parts of
the first two machines and expect to
begin producing electricity again this
December. The restoration job is ex-
pected to be completed by 1948.
The latest machine, like its two pred-
ecessors, weighs more than 2,250,000
pounds, and is the largest in physical
size ever built. With a frame diameter
of 42 feet, 5 inches, the new generators
are so large that they would be taller
than a three story building if set on

infra-red vision:
Beaches that were in total darkness to
enemy observers were made clearly visi-
ble to U.S. Navy forces through the use
of infrared-sensitive electron telescopes
and infra-red floodlights and markers.
By means of these small, lightweight,
infra-red viewing devices, "invisible"
landing boats were put ashore on enemy
territory and beach-heads were estab-
lished by "invisible" men.
These instruments enabled the Navy
to conduct landing, reconnaissance and
offensive operations as well as make
communications by infra-red signal
lights. Undercover of absolute visual
darkness, on cloudy nights and in the
dark of the moon, Navy personnel were
"invisible men" of play and story.
The heart of the infra-red electron
telescope is a small, image tube, utilizing
many of the principles employed in
electronic television systems, having a
photosensitive surface, but especially
sensitive to infra-red radiation. Begun
as an outgrowth of research on televi-
sion camera tubes utilizing visible light,
and further developed under a contract
with the National Defense Research
Committee, the infra-red image tubes
were ultimately designed as small as 1 %
inch in diameter by 41/^&gt; inches long.
The infra-red image tube is a scien-
tific answer to man's age-old search for
a means of seeing without being seen.
The same tubes were used in the
Army's sniperscope and snooperscope.
The sniperscope was attached to a rifle
and served as a gunsight as well as
a means of seeing an enemy in darkness,
while the snooperscope enabled Army
personnel to carry out short-range re-
connaisance under security of complete
darkness.
Work began in the early 1930's when,
while working with visible light sources
concerning television pick-up devices, it
was found possible to translate an in-
fra-red image, first in to an electron
image, and then into a pattern of visible
light on a fluorescent screen. Soon the
increased sensitivity greatly expanded
the field of application of the electron
telescope. The small 41/£-inch-long tube
had been developed by 1942.
On August 25, 1942, the various ap-
plications were tested in a complete am-
phibious landing operation staged off

When metal first went through the mill
The first rolling mill in this country was
on the Chester Creek in the Colony of
Pennsylvania. It was built in 1746 by
John Taylor, the descendant of an English
settler, for his "Sarum Ironworks." The
plant had "three stacks" and worked at
"full blast," turning out iron bars which
were hauled to Marcus Hook for shipping.
Today not only rolling mills but ingot
cars, cranes and all the heavy machines
used in the steel industry are equipped
with anti-friction bearings, many of which
are furnished by aDSF. For fSCSIF
Bearings support tremendous loads and

water repellent-:
A new water-repellent, which already
has found many useful industrial appli-
cations since its wartime development,
has been put to work to eliminate the
"peeps" and "squeaks" emanating from
electric organs. Treatment of the plastic
bushings in the musical instruments
with the invisible "raincoat" prevents
moisture from depositing itself on sensi-
tive parts of the mechanism.
Dri-Film, which when applied to cer-
amics, plastics, glass, paper, and many
other materials enables them to "shed"
water, is also being used to afford faster
starting of certain types of fluorescent
lamps and to solve the problem of hu-
midity causing hearing-aid devices to go
dead. When treated with this protective,
the lamps and hearing aid devices are
covered with an invisible and permanent
coating making them insensitive to high
humidity. It is the best material yet
found to form a continuous film over
glass. It is applied easily, and lamps
can be maintained with only customary
cleaning. Tests have shown that the
lamps, when coated with the water-
repellent, operate satisfactorily under
100 per cent relative humidity.
precision instrument:
Recently developed scientific preci-
sion instruments are "splitting hairs" so
minute these days that it's now possible
to measure vacuum pressures as low as
1/100 billionth of a pound per square
inch, to record weights within 1/100
thousandth of an ounce, and to measure
thickness down to 1/100 millionth of an
inch. These accuracies are not sufficient
for the scientist and engineer in their
continued research for industrial prog-
ress. Industrial applications of elec-
tronic devices and the development of
such research tools as the atom-smash-
ing cyclotron and betatron demand very
sensitive instruments by which a better
understanding of the phenomena may
be gained.
Practically the entire electronics in-
dustry depends upon "high vacuum" to
produce sealed-off devices whether they
be the smallest radio receiving tube or
100 kilowatt tubes used in broadcasting.
With the vacuum "measuring stick"
technically known as the ion gage, sci-
entists and engineers are able to tell by
direct reading if a vacuum is "high
enough to assure more efficient opera-
tion and longer-life radio and electronic
tubes.
The pressure measure instrument,
constructed similar to an ordinary re-
ceiving tube, makes possible the meas-
urement of the "highest vacuum" or-
dinarily encountered in the laboratory.
High vacuum is a very rarefied atmos-
phere having pressure of from IS mil-
lionths of a pound per square inch down
to pressures a million times or more
lower. The lowest pressure obtainable
in laboratory experiments is about
1/100 billionth of a pound per square
inch.
This is still a long way from a perfect
vacuum. A perfect vacuum is not pos-
sible on earth, but it does exist out in
intersteller space between the moments
when a stray molecule traveling aim-
lessly a thousand million miles collides
with another, which has travelled as far.

CHARLES BEICHTLER "49 E"
Today, one rarely thinks of automo-
biles except in terms of the gasoline, or
internal combustion, engine. The vast
majority of our cars are driven by
means of the gasoline engine, and one
might think that this were always the
case. Several means of power have been
used in the past, however, and some of
these might return to use in the future.
Cars powered by an electric motor have
been used, and even today a few are
still in use. These electric vehicles were
costly to run and are inadequate for
modern uses. Cars which were powered
by steam, however, are even less well
known than the electric cars. Most of
the people of this generation have yet
to see a steam car. Yet, steam cars pre-
ceded the gasoline cars, and in the near
future, steam might once again come
back to power road vehicles.
Steam, as a source of power for road
vehicles, dates as far back as the rail-
road engine. In 1784, James Watt sug-
gested the application of the steam en-
gine to road carriages. Later in that
same year, a model was constructed
which had a speed of eight miles per
hour. Nothing further was done along
these lines until 1803, when another
steam coach was constructed by a man
named Trevithick. It was built along
the lines of the stage coaches of the
day, and was powered by a single-stroke
steam engine. It proved that smooth-
tired wheels had sufficient traction for
road work, a fact which was not re-
membered when interest was revived in
steam coaches twenty years later.
From 1820 on, a number of steam
vehicles were constructed, but few were
run on the road for any length of time.
The attempt to introduce steam coaches
to the public was a definite failure at
this time. The interests of the coaching
system, and all forms of horse-drawn
transportation, had many branches. The
inns and tourist homes depended on
them for their business. Also, the people
of the day were very conservative in
their outlook on all matters. So, the
steam coach failed, and by 1840 it had
disappeared.
Then, from 1900 onward, the steam
vehicle showed signs of a revival. Dou-

Charles Weightier
ble-deck steam buses ran in England
between 1903 and 1920. The principal
development was a vehicle which carried
goods. By 1927, nine thousand of these
steam trucks were in use. Then the
numbers of this most popular form of
steam vehicle began to decline, until
the vehicle finally disappeared.1
Today, road vehicles propelled by
steam are almost unheard of. If the
only reasons for the failure of the steam
coach were the private interests and the
public outlook of one hundred years
ago, why has the steam car never come
back? Some authorities believe that
steam power can come back, and these
authorities are certain that it will.
"It seems not altogether unreasonable
to suppose that steam as applied to road
transportation could now be employed
to do what it failed to do thirty years
ago. Some of the causes for that failure
were mechanical, others were political,
and others again were psychological. If,
for instance, the driver of a petrol vehi-
cle were asked today to get out every
few miles to replenish his radiator wa-
ter, he would express strong views. If
asked to light up a small tray of petrol
or alcohol and wait minutes before be-
ing able to drive away, the same thing
would happen. If it were necessary to
pay strict attention to a water gauge, a
pressure gauge, and a thermometer, in
fact, to do anything more than press an
accelerator pedal, not a single car would
be sold. Steam engineers seemed satis-
fied to regard their machine as an engi-
neering structure requiring skilled driv-
ing and close attention, and not as a
vehicle for supplying trouble-free trans-
port." 2
While steam-engineers were thus satis-
fied, the gasoline engine was gradually
developed, until it occupied a dominant
position in a large-volume market. This
great market provided funds for contin-
ued experimentation and research to fur-
ther the development of the gasoline car.
If these funds had been spent to develop
the steam car, we might today have
cars powered by steam instead of those
powered by gasoline engines.
Reducing the weight of a gasoline car
was just as important at one time as
reducing the weight of steam vehicles is
now. In the gasoline engine, this weight-
reduction was accomplished mainly
through the use of high-speed engines.
Today we get three times the power of
earlier engines for the same weight. A
steam engine can be much lighter than
a gasoline engine at the same speed.
The boiler of the earlier days has been
replaced by the steam generator of to-
day. Steam engineers consider this to
be a big improvement. "The actual
evaporating surface is now a very small
proportion of the super-heated-steam
generator. It must be of the mono-tube
type for quick steaming to respond to
the demand of road acceration. Lighter
in itself in construction, it also carries
much less water in the system. This
extra weight of steam plant must be
set against the gear box, the weight of
which for a ten horse-power car is sixty
pounds. On this account the total
weight of engine and generator against
and gear box should show practically
no difference." 3
Besides the problem of weight, there
were other early disadvantages to over-
come in steam. The chief mechanical
disadvantage was the absence of some
means for automatic boiler control. The
public must be able to drive steam cars

BENJAMIN F. BAILY
Professor Emeritus of Electrical Engineeri
How frequently the student of engi-
neering is confronted with this phrase
and how seldom does he stop to con-
sider all it implies. An "assumption" is
rarely strictly true but only approxi-
mately so and usually only through a
limited range of conditions. Thus, in
my own profession of electrical engi-
neering, the most used equation is Ohms
Law, I =—. This is a shorthand way
of saying, "the current in a circuit is
proportional to the applied emf," but to
be strictly accurate we should add, "as
long as the resistance does not change."
It is very fortunate for the electrical
engineer that the resistance of a circuit
is usually practically constant. Especi-
ally is it fortunate that it does not vary
with the current. Thus, a piece of cop-
per wire may have a resistance of 1 ohm
with a current of one ampere passing
and, likewise, a resistance of precisely
one ohm with 10,000 amperes flowing.
The resistance is entirely independent
of the current. Others kinds of engi-
neers are not so fortunate, as we shall
see presently. We must, of course, add
that the above is based on the "assump-
tion" that the temperature does not
change. If the wire heats, its resistance
does vary quite decidedly, as much as
15 or 20 c/o for the ordinary range of
temperatures of electrical machinery.
If, however, the electrical engineer
should be called upon to deal with an
arc light and if he were to assume that
the resistance of the arc is constant, he
would quickly find himself in trouble.
In an arc the resistance does change
with the current, becoming low with
large currents, high with small cur-
rents and practically infinite with zero
current. As a matter of fact, it requires
more voltage to maintain an arc of 10
amperes than one of 20 amperes. With
a constant applied voltage an arc is en-
tirely unstable and the current would
instantly drop to zero or increase to a
tremendous value, limited only by the
source of supply. One of the outstand-
ing inventions in electrical engineering
was a workable arc light system.
Charles Brush, who succeeded after
many others had failed, accomplished
his purpose by using a generator more
unstable than the arc. It was a series
generator, worked at such a large cur-
rent that any moderate increase dropped
the voltage to zero and any decrease
caused the voltage to rise sharply.
ohms law
Although we are accustomed to as-
sociate Ohms Law with electric circuits
only, it has a much wider application.
Essentially, Ohms Law is merely a
statement that the effect is proportional
to the cause and this is more or less
true in many phenomena, e.g. the
stretch of a wire, the flow of water or
air in a pipe, the charge in a condenser
and many others. Unfortunately, what
corresponds to electrical resistance is
frequently far from being a constant.
Thus, the hydraulic engineer might say
of a pipe carying a stream of water
Gallons per minute =
Difference of pressure
Resistance
He would, however, be far from the
truth if he assumed that the resistance
is a constant. In an electric circuit, re-
sistance is a simple thing and can usu-
ally be treated as a constant; in the
case of a pipe carrying water or air,
this is far from being true. The re-
sistance is a function of the rate of
flow and varies in such an erratic way
that it is impossible to put it in the
form of a simple equation. For example,
above a certain velocity we get turbu-
lence and the engineer is forced to rely
upon data derived from actual experi-
ment. The railway engineer is con-
fronted with a similar situation; the re-
sistance of a freight train is a function
of velocity as well as other things and
cannot be expressed in any simple way.
Fortunes have been spent to obtain em-
pirical equations for the resistance of
railway trains. The electrical engineer,
fortunately for him, can take his Wheat-
stone bridge and get his answer in a few
minutes; the other engineers I have
mentioned can not, but must undertake
a long and expensive series of tests.
All of this has a bearing on an ob-
servation which frequently used to
shock my classes; namely that electri-
cal engineering is much simpler than
mechanical, hydraulic, or aeronautical
engineering. Why? Because many elec-
trical relations can be simply expressed
in words or in mathematical equations.
It is then a straightforward, though
sometimes laborious, matter to perform
various transformations upon the equa-
tions and finally interpret the result. As
a consequence, electrical engineering
literature is plentifully sprinkled with
integral signs and the like while the
literature of other branches of engineer-
ing is relatively free of such symbols.
Many times, natural phenomena are so
complicated that it becomes impossible
to reduce them to mathematical equa-
tions even with a liberal use of "as-
sumptions." The difference is much like
that between the piano and the clarinet.
Inherently, the piano is much the sim-
pler of the two instruments, but to play
it well requires just as much work as it
does to play the clarinet well. What
makes up the difference is the fact that
we can and do play more complicated
music on the piano. If you doubt this,
try to play two notes at once on a clari-
net. So in electrical engineering we play
more difficult "music" simply because
it is possible to do so.
about names
Sometimes the shoe is on the other
foot. The mechanical engineer has fre-
quent occasion to use the expression
dt
or, force is equal to mass times the rate
of change of velocity (acceleration).
This expression may be taken as exact.
Mass is a real constant, at least until
we approach the velocity of light. The
12

or, electro-motive force is equal to the
inductance times the rate of change of
the current. Inductance, like mass, is
a true constant for a coil of wire in air
or a transmission line, but as soon as
we have iron in the magnetic circuit,
L varies with the current and we can
use the simple expression only by "as-
suming" that L is a constant. Unless
we recognize this fact we are likely to
be led astray. Incidentally, a very sim-
ple method of regulating a current is
based upon this fact. A laminated iron
core is surrounded by two coils of wire,
one carrying the alternating current to
be regulated, the other an adjustable
direct current. If the latter is small or
zero, the inductance is high and only
a small alternating current can pass,
but if the direct current is increased,
the iron becomes saturated with mag-
netic flux, the inductance drops to a low
value and the alternating current be-
comes large.
More and more we are able to sup-
plant cut-and-try methods by accurate
theory, but still there are (and always
will be) innumerable cases where we
must assume certain things, either for
lack of knowledge or because, if we were
to include all the factors, our equations
would become unmanageable.
about springs
I have cited one case (friction) where
the mechanical (and I always include,
hydraulic, naval, aeronautical, etc.) en-
gineer has to make assumptions, far
from the exact truth, and one (electrical
inertia or inductance) in which the elec-
trical engineer is at a disadvantage.
We come now to a third element which
enters into most electrical and mechani-
cal calculations—namely, spring action.
Everyone knows what a mechanical
spring is, but what is an electrical
spring? A spring may be broadly de-
fined as something to which you can
apply force, thereby storing up energy.
The electrical spring first appeared in
the shape of the Leyden jar. It is now
known as a condenser, or as a capacitor,
and consists of two sheets of conducting
material, usually sheet aluminum sep-
arated by insulating material, frequently
paper impregnated with oil. They are
so useful that about 30,000,000 are in
use in automobile ignition circuits and
many more than this in radio apparatus.
A comparable number of mechanical
springs are in use and both capacitors
and springs serve the same purpose, to
store energy which can be later returned
with little or no loss.
Fortunately, all springs follow the
same law and, within wide limits, no
assumptions need be made. In the me-
chanical spring,
Displacement = Force x a Constant
and, in the electrical spring or capacitor,
Charge = Electric force x a Constant
usually written
Q=EC
in which Q is the quantity or electricity,
E is the emf and C is the capacitance.
Even here we must make some as-
sumptions. If we compress a valve
spring too far, the coils come into con-
tact and the displacement is limited and
if we stretch it too far, it will straighten
out and finally break. Similiarly, in the
capacitor, if we increase the emf too far,
the dielectric punctures and it it is no
longer a condenser. Moreover, if we
stress a piece of steel too far we pass
the elastic limit and it no longer obeys
this simple law. I hope by now the
reader begins to understand that most
physical phenomena are not so simple
as they seem to be. Nature is infinitely
complex and it is only by making sim-
plifying assumptions that we are able
to reduce laws to simple mathematical
expressions and make progress in learn-
ing the secrets of the world we live in.
Occasionally very puzzling things
happen in engineering and it frequently
turns out that we have "proved" some-
thing which is not so, by making too
many simplifying assumptions. Thus a
student of electrical engineering learns
that a synchronous motor may take a
lagging or a leading current depending
upon the strength of the field excitation.
If the current changes from lagging to
leading as the field current is changed
there must be some point at which it
neither leads or lags and at that point
the power factor must be unity. But
when he comes to try it in the labora-
tory or in practice, he may find that
the best power factor he can possibly
get is much less than unity. He checks
his instruments; still he cannot reach
100%. What is wrong? Easy. The
proof was for perfectly sinusoidal volt-
ages and these exist only in text books
(although we usually come quite close
to it in practice). With more or less
distorted voltages the proof is obviously
only approximate. Again, things are
not so simple as they seem.
On one occasion I attempted to
measure the capacitance of some con-
densers by measuring the current taken
from a line of known voltage and fre-
quency. The formula is very simple,
I = 2 7r f E C, and it should be easy to
compute C knowing f, E and I. The
results were very puzzling, until I hap-
pened to remember that the formula is
for sinusoidal currents and slight "rip-
ple" on the wave causes the current to
increase greatly. I had wasted an hour
or two but had learned to remember the
foundation upon which a formula is
built.
Nature has been kind to us in many
ways. For example, if we "assume" that
water always contracts when it gets
cooler, we would be forced to believe
that the earth, north of Florida, would
be uninhabitable. Why? Because our
lakes would then freeze from the bottom
up. Our large rivers and our lakes
would be solid ice except for a thin layer
of water on top. Even in the middle of
summer, man could hardly live in such
a world; at least it would not be much
fun.
Nature has been good to us in another
way; she has caused the ether to obey
exactly the law that displacement is
equal to force times a constant. In other
words, it is a perfect spring. (I know
as well as you that "ether" is out of
date but I know no better name). If
this were not so, light waves would be
distorted, radio waves all mixed up and
our simple laws of electro-magnetic and
electro-static induction would no longer
be exact and we would be forced to
make many more assumptions than we
now have to make. Again, life would
hardly be worth while if the face of
your girl friend looked all blurred and
never twice the same.
All this leads up to a thought which
I would like to leave in your mind. All
matter is composed of minute particles
of electricity (electrons, protons, neu-
trons, etc.); there is nothing in the
world but electricity. It is difficult to
believe that this pencil with which I am
writing, is nothing but a collection of
particles of electricity, but the evidence
drives us to this conclusion. It therefore
seems plausible that matter should obey
the same laws as electricity, and, sure
enough, it does. When you try to move
a heavy mass suddenly, a resisting force
is set up and when we try to start or
stop a current of electricity in a coil of
wire, a similar force is encountered. In
ordinary matter this force is given by
dv
f = M —- , and, in electricity,

torial history of the Engineering College.)
The campus is having its face lifted
again, one of those expensive, infrequent
jobs that calls for an architect instead
of a doctor. The engineering school is
benefiting from the change. A new wing
is being added to the East Engineering
Building; the chem mets and the grads
won't recognize their alma mater when
the addition is complete. The change
brings something to mind—how many
such transformations has the "engine"
school gone through since its concep-
tion? What changes have taken place
since the first sheepskins graced the
palms of the first of our venerable
predecessors?
The engineering college was born in
the beginning of time, about 18S2 or
'53, when it was first officially entered
in the University records. Civil engi-
neering was the only division taught
and, though classes were commenced in
1853 and six seniors existed in 1857,
degrees in engineering were not author-
ized until 1860. The number of degrees
conferred rose swiftly, so that by 1867
an unheard-of number of eight was
granted. By this time mining engineer-
ing had been added to the schooUs scope
and in 1872, with the school overflowing
from unprecedented enrollment, the
faculty staff was expanded to include
one professor and two instructors.
About this time the three rooms in
the south wing of University Hall, (a
converted men's dorm) that had been
loaned to the precocious engineers, were
getting a little too crowded for the am-
bitious slip-stick pushers. The first
addition to the engineering college was
in order—more space had to be allotted
to the new school, for they could not
be discouraged. (Besides, the desks
didn't have any initial-space left, and
the pot-belly, professor-fired stoves
that stood in the center of each room
had smoked the rooms pretty badly.
The Regents consented and, in 1881,
allotted the astronomical sum of $1,500
(the East Engineering addition runs
over $1,500,000) for the construction of
an engineering building and $1,000 for
equipment. But the college grew and
grew. An addition was constructed in
1885 and another one in 1887. This
structure was officially christened the
"Engineering Building." It came to be
known as the Old Engineering Building
and is today referred to as the West
Engineering Annex.
In 1891 the Department of Engineer-
ing confiscated what for fourteen years
had been the Dental Laboratory. The
building was one of four professors'
homes built in 1840 and later used as
University buildings. With a few en-
largements and a third story cap, the
engineers managed to squeeze fifteen
classrooms from the newly acquired pos-
session. Over the entrance was hung a
semi-circular stone displaying boldly the
huge letters "ENGINEERING." The
time worn classrooms were finally razed
during a 1921 face lifting operation and
in its place was erected the Clements
Library.
At the turn of the century, when engi-
neering finally established itself, a big-
ger and better building was designed to
accommodate the engineers. Completed
in 1903 and standing on the southeast
corner of the campus, it was composed
of two wings, the South Wing, extending
along South University and the East
Wing, extending along East University.
The building housed, in addition to the
classrooms, offices and laboratories, and
the now famous naval tank. The East
Wing was only half its present length,
and in that day the first story, contain-
ing the naval tank, could be seen ex-
tending beyond the four-story structure.
This architectural discrepancy ceased to
exist when, in 1908, to take care of in-
creased enrollment, the East Wing was
expanded to its present size and shape,
adding a short North Wing.
After 1908, the engineers sighed and
settled back to consolidate their gains.
It wasn't until 1921 that they again
expanded. The destruction of the Old
Engineering Building for the benefit of
the Clements Library called for the re-
placement of needed classroom space.
(This was when the engineer*s pet peeve
had its beginning). East Hall was pur-
chased to make up for the loss. This
fugitive from the gay nineties was built
in 1883 and was called by its youthful
inhabitants the Tappan School—a grade
school, property of Ann Arbor, With
minor changes it contained 23 class-
rooms and some offices. It became the
sanctuary of the Engineering English
Department and its engineering student
enthusiasts. Condemned by everyone
who had ever been in it to be destroyed
in the fated year of 1929, it still sur-
vives, despite engineering pyromaniac
abilities and techniques. What happened
in 1929 is difficult to determine. There
seems to be a historical gap between
that time and the Rooseveltian era. But
there is a gleam of hope in every Michi-
gan engineer's eye, for the days of East
Hall are numbered and big plans are in
store for the vacancy it will leave.
The purchase of East Hall did not
relieve the congestion resulting from in-
creased enrollment. By 1923 construc-
tion was completed on the East Engi-
neering Building, giving additional room
to the departments of Chemical and
Metallurgical Engineering, Aeronautical
Engineering, Transportation Engineer-
ing, Metal Processing, Engineering Re-
search and the State Highway Labora-
tories.
From 1923 to the summer of 1945,
naught but theory was given to the
expansion of the Engineering College.
First a West Engineering Quadrangle
was proposed. A north and west wing
were to be added to the existing struc-
ture, giving the engineers two arches
and a private court. Because the cam-
pus would be seriously crowded with
the building of such a structure, the
proposal was dropped.
Fond dreams became realities when
the ground was finally spaded in the
summer of 1945 for the construction of
a south-wing addition to the East Engi-
neering Building. If construction con-
tinues uninterrupted, the addition
should be completed by the fall of 1947
at a cost of over $1,500,000. (Only a
stone's throw from the $1,500 given for
the first complete engineering building).
The south wing will extend from East
University to Church Street and add

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC



Julius Miklowiri, 43E
Julius Miklowitz, a 1943 graduate of
the Engineering College with his degree
in Mechanical engineering, has been
awarded a $1,000 scholarship for post-
graduate study toward his doctorate in
applied mechanics at Harvard Univer-
sity. After securing his bachelor's de-
gree in 1943, he became affiliated with

Julius Miklowitz
Westinghouse Electric Corporation,
where he has been employed for three
years on important metallurgical re-
search for the government. His findings
concerning the strength of steel, when
placed under great fractural stress have
resulted in an important series of ex-
periments designed to produce stronger
steel for military use. He received his
master's degree in mechanical engineer-
ing following work at the University of
Pittsburgh during the evening sessions.
shell aid advancement
From the New York office of the Shell
Oil Company comes the announcement
of the elevation of two University of
Michigan Engineering College, graduates
within their research and development
department.
Dr. Peter J. Merkus, who received his
ws
B.S.E. (Ch.E.) in 1931, his M.S.E. in
1932, and his Ph.D. in 1934, has been
named assistant to the vice-president in
charge of manufacturing. Upon his
graduation from the University, Dr.
Merkus became affiliated with Shell im-
mediately, and has since progressed
through various positions of increasing
responsibility in the research and de-
velopment department, becoming mana-
ger of the department in 1943, a posi-
tion he held until his recent promotion.
Succeeding Dr. Merkus as manager
of the research and development depart-
ment is F. C. Cutting, who received
his bachelor's in chemical engineer-
ing in 1925 and his master's in
1926, from the engineering college of
the University.
Shortly after receiving his M.S.E.
from the University, Mr. Cutting took
a position with Shell and has. since that
time, progressed through the technical
and administrative departments of the
company's refineries to the position of
assistant manager of the research and
development division, which post he
held until his recent elevation.
Cen. Gladeon M. Barnes, '10E
From Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,
comes the announcement of the award
of the 1946 Elliott Cresson Gold Medal
of the Franklin Institute to Major Gen-
eral Gladeon M. Barnes, '10E. General
Barnes, Chief of the Research and De-
velopment Service, Office of the Chief
of Ordnance, United States Army Serv-
ice Forces, received the award "in con-
sideration of his notable contributions
to the design and development of nu-
merous ordnance items, particularly
anti-aircraft guns, tanks, and seacoast
artillery; for his early development of
welded gun carriages; and for his mas-
terly organization of ordnance research,
closely articulated with development and
production."
General Barnes received his degree
in Civil Engineering from the Uni-
versity of Michigan in 1910, and im-
mediately thereafter worked on the de-
sign of the Quebec Bridge for the
Canadian Bridge Company of Windsor.
Through a competitive examination, he
was appointed a second lieutenant in
the Coast Artillery Corps in 1910 and
subsequently served as assistant fire-
control officer at Frankfort Arsenal, and
was stationed at Sandy Hook Proving
Ground. During World War I he was
in France, where he aided in the design
of French and American railway artil-
lery. During the ten years following
cessation of hostilities, he served abroad,
securing data relative to anti-aircraft
artillery and fire-control equipment be-
ing produced there. As Chief Engineer
at Watertown Arsenal, he introduced
welding into the manufacture of gun
carriages, which process won for him a
$3500 prize from the Lincoln Electric
Company.
Since 1942, General Barnes has been
in complete charge of all the research
and development work of the ordnance
department. Under his guidance, some
1,100 new items of ordnance equipment
were initiated, developed, standardized,
and placed into production for use by
our armies. He has been granted 33
patents. His professional affiliations in-
clude Tau Beta Pi, the Newcomen So-
ciety of England, the American Insti-
tute of Mechanical Engineers, and the

Gen. Gladeon M. Barnes
Army Ordnance Association. He was
awarded the honorary degree of Doctor
of Engineering by the Illinois Institute
of Technology. In 1945 he was awarded
the Distinguished Service Medal for his
contribution toward the winning of the
war, and in March, 1946, he was nomi-
nated by President Truman and con-
firmed by the Senate to be Assistant to
the Chief of Ordnance for a period of
four years.

PLICTS
I arise from this, my hospital bed,
to write the TECHNIC REFLECTS, in
spite of all the damage done to me by
those "Stockwell Stevedores." Never let
it be said that a McHigan succumbed to
the wiles of any witch. I can handle
'em as well as any other 'old salt' who
fought the "Battle of Ann Arbor."
Furthermore, I intend to get even
with those wicked wire-haired wenches,
in a manner to be prescribed at a later
date. Not a day shall I rest (following
my recovery, of course) until the honor
of the name Ambrose McHigan has been
avenged. One thing I intend to do, just
for spite, is to burn all the leaves on
campus before the 1st of January so
there won't be any for them to turn over
at New Year's time.

As December days grow longer and
the skies more gray, I think back to the
time of Michigan's football victories not
too many weeks ago. Perhaps some of
you also had your triumphal spirits
dampened (after the State massacre) by
a little old lady who wasn't all there—
definitely a screw loose somewhere. Just
like my Aunt Ambrosia, the bats got in
her hair and so did the thundering herd
of football spectators as they pushed
roughly over lawns and shrubbery in
headlong stampede away from the stadi-
um.
Wending my way through the devious
maze of Ann Arbor streets in the general
direction of campus, food, and civiliza-
tion, I was stopped by the strange sight
of a little old lady watering the lawn in
front of a house near the railroad tracks.
I was suddenly started again, however,
when I found to my surprise and chagrin
that the browning grass was receiving
only the smaller portion of the "aqua
pura" and that people were being wa-
tered far more copiously.
With rather "impura" language and a
"dampnation" or two, I betook myself
for more arid regions where objects
which don't have chlorophyll can live in
blissful drought. I'll admit I was
thirsty but as long as the "P Bell"
serves the ethyl variety of water I'll
pass by the regular stuff in a hurry, and
a particular orange-brown house even
faster, hereafter.

The moral of this epic is, "Some
women will always give you a hosing,"
or "Hey, you—quit hosing around!"
The story, as written, has reference
to definite persons and places and is not
intended to be an infringement of any of
Louisa Mae Alcott's copyrights ("Little
Women" to any uncultured engineers).
* * *
My biology prof, once said, "Mc-
Higan, what makes you so ignorant?
You can't culture engineers in agar-agar
solution."

And speaking of solutions, that re-
minds me of my freshman chemistry
back in—well it's been quite a while. It
was in CM 1 class, that Prof. "Whip"
York had said, "McHigan, I want you to
have the solution of these twenty-eight
home problems before next week." So I
trotted over to the chem. lab. to dis-
cover that for which scientists had spent
a lifetime seeking—a universal solvent.
Now that I have gone into the study
of chemistry a little further, I begin to
realize why the papers just turned brown
in that acid mixture. Not a solution did
I get, but Prof. York was almost willing
to give me a "D" in the course for try-
ing so hard.
* * *
It won't be many months before the
doors of East and West Engineering will
be swinging in and out like the ballad-
ized bar-room portals. The last "Open
House" was held back in 1941, as I
recall, about the time I was making my
third attempt at a freshman year.
We are expecting plenty of organized
production out of what might seem to be
unorganized talk from the Engineering
Council, the boys who are supposed to
be running the show. No doubt they can
put it over, though, if the engineers en
masse don't play split-party govern-
ment and gum up the works, similar to
a certain North American government I
know of.
With a little help from everyone and
free beer in every exhibit, the "En-
gineering Open House" will reach the
(hie) heights of success.
* * *
As we near the end of this page and
your misery, I see no reason for chang-
ing the subject to something other than
solutions. We'll try a gaseous variety
this time. The following may be omitted
by those students of physical chemistry
who will insist upon disintegrating the
dubious continuity of REFLECTS by
proclaiming the qualities of an aerosol
(similar to a parasol but equipped with
shorter handle.)
Not long ago, Tuesday of the eighth
week for those of you who wish to
be exact, East engineering ventilators
belched forth clouds of what smelled
like a mixture of cheap fly spray
and the come-hither juice worn by
some of "Newberry's Nocknees." J. T.
banChEro of the ChE Department blew
a gasket shortly after the Dowtherm
equipment down in the CM. Operations
Lab. This combined mixture of hot air
and vapor successfully filled the central
court with dense white clouds. These
were promptly picked up by the ventila-
tors and pumped through each class-
room as exhibit "A" of why fly spray is
kept in cans.
Numerous other profs, could be seen
scurrying through the building in an
effort to reach the seat of the trouble.
Profiting by Banchero's unfortunate ex-
ample, they each blew fuses instead of
hot air to prevent any further reactions.
The ghostly-white figures of Michi-
gan's finest chemical engineers staggered
out of the lab in a DDT'd condition.
They were in no hurry to re-discover the
seat of the trouble, having all too re-
cently emerged from trouble's trousers.
Now that the equipment is back in
operation, we may smile at the B.O. we
once had and hope our women will
forgive an improper imitation of femi-
nine perfumery. It won't happen again,
girls, not while East Engin's fire escapes
are usable.

Doctor Lee O. Case, Assistant Profes-
sor of Chemistry, is one of the old-timers
around the campus. He was plowing
through the Arch to make eight-o-clocks
as early as 1914.
Another reason Dr. Case can sympa-
thize with most of the engineers now on
campus is that his education, too, was
broken up by foreign military service.
He, too, had to come back and pick up
the threads of learning after having
lived in an artificial world. He had
served two years in the Field Artillery,
with one year in France, during the first
World War.

Dr. Lee 0. Case
He came back to Michigan and re-
ceived his degree in Chemical Engineer-
ing in 1920. After graduation, Professor
Case decided that pure chemistry ap-
pealed to him more than the engineer-
ing aspect. In 1926 he completed his
dissertation on "The Electrical Conduc-
tivity of Solutions" for his Doctorate in
Chemistry.
Since receiving his Doctor's degree,
he has been on the faculty of the
Chemistry Department at the Univer-
sity of Michigan, specializing in Physi-
cal Chemistry. Of particular interest at
the present time is the Phase Rule which
Professor Case has been applying to
solutions and alloys. So successfully,
in fact, that he has been engaged as a
consultant by progressive industrial
processors in this country to aid them
in solving their problems by application
of the Phase Rule.
One of the most time-consuming re-
sponsibilities of Doctor Case this semes-
ter is seeing that the new addition to the
Chemistry Building goes up as sched-
uled. With his office filled with blue-
prints, catalogs of furniture, and sam-
ples, the professor says that as chairman
of the Building Committee, he is taking
the part more of an architect than of
a chemist.
The professor says he has known
since his high-school days in Marshall,
Michigan, that his field was chemistry.
He has followed through in chemistry
ever since that time except during the
war when there was such a deluge of
men into the Engineering School that
the facilities of the entire University had
to be adapted to the emergency. Dr.
Case had to neglect his concentration on
chemistry, and he spent his time teach-
ing mathematics to service-men who
were here for a technical training.
floyd
Floyd W. Preston, president of the
Michigan chapter of the A.I.Ch.E., was
born on Thomas A. Edison's birthday,
February 11th, in 1923. Although he
was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico,
Floyd claims California as his home
state, for his family moved there as soon
as he was old enough to travel.
From Los Angeles High School, Floyd
went straight to the University of Cali-
fornia at Los Angeles, where he special-
ized in Chemistry. It was here that he
met his future wife, the daughter of
the chairman of UCLA's Math depart-
ment. After two years at UCLA, Floyd
was admitted to the California Institute
of Technology at Pasadena, where he
earned his bachelor's degree in Chemis-
try after only three more terms of work.
Then he plunged into a war research
project at Cal Tech, under Professor
Linus Pauling, the noted Physical
Chemistry authority. Between experi-
ments with smokeless powder as a
rocket propellant, Floyd took time out
to marry the girl he'd met two years
before, who was now an Astronomy
graduate of the University of California
at Berkeley. After fifteen months of this
vital research work (the rockets which
he helped to perfect were used by the
Marines at Kwajalein, Leyte, and Iwo
Jima), the war ended, and the demand
for rocket weapons fell off abruptly.
As a result of his experience in war re-

Floyd W. Preston
search, Floyd became convinced that
Chemical Engineering offered a more
interesting career and greater opportu-
nity for advancement than Chemistry.
Since the West Coast colleges offered
few curricula in Chemical Engineering,
he set out for an "Eastern School," and
arrived in Ann Arbor in October of
1945. Here, Floyd helped to revive the
A.I.Ch.E. on the Michigan Campus, and
became its secretary. Last spring he
was elected President of the University
of Michigan Chapter for the year 1946-
47. He feels that the experience in
human relations and engineering knowl-
edge gained from such student organiza-
tions is invaluable to the young engi-
neer.
Floyd will receive his bachelor's de-
gree in Ch.E. this February, but plans
to go on with work toward a master's
degree in the same field, for he has
been awarded a Fellowship by the
Standard Oil Company of California.
He is now working, under Professor
D. L. Katz, on a study of asphalt in
crude oil.

barnacles
When a vessel is placed in dry dock,
several men are assigned to the un-
pleasant duty of scraping the barnacles
from the bottom of the hull. It has
been found that barnacles and seaweed
growth on a ship's bottom may increase
its frictional resistance to flow by as
much as 500%. This not only cuts the
ship's speed by several knots, but it also
increases the horsepower required for
that speed, and may raise fuel consump-
tion to three times its former value. For
these reasons, the barnacles must be re-
moved from the hull of a ship as fre-
quently as possible. Naturally, any
process which prevents their initial at-
tachment to the ship would be highly
desirable.
In the past, the only treatment cap-
able of preventing barnacle growths in-
volved the painting of the hull with a
hot, plastic material of Italian origin,
known as "Moravian Paint." Though
this paint proved effective, its composi-
tion was unknown, and could not be
determined by American chemists, even
after intensive study.
Early in the 1930's, the United States
Navy initiated a program of research
in quest of a similar formula. Several
substitutes were found and tested dur-
ing naval maneuvers, but were found
to be "generally untrustworthy."
The Navy was forced to widen the
scope of its research program, and naval
stations all over the country, in con-
junction with Columbia University and
the University of Miami, began a study
of barnacles and other fouling growths,
as well as toxic agents used to prevent
them. It was found that oxides of cop-
per, when suspended in paint, not only
protected the ship's hull from corrosion

and pitting due to the salinity of the
seawater, but also discouraged the at-
tachment of barnacles. The organisms
which do attach themselves are poisoned
by toxicity of the paint, and drop off
before they have time to grow shells for
protection. Thus, seaweed has no bar-
nacle-growths in which to lodge and
grow, and the ships treated with this

material can operate for five years in
the saltiest water without a single scrap-
ing.
The paint, which had to be applied in
a hot, plastic state, required elaborate
apparatus to heat the material and pro-
vide pressure for spraying. The heating
is accomplished in large electrically-
heated tanks, from which compressed
air forces the paint into the spraying
equipment through an electrically
heated hose. Wet sandblasting, to bare
the metal hulls, and a base-coat which
kept the poisonous copper compounds
from reacting with the steel, were also
developed.
By 1944, the Navy reported that it
had "reduced the fleet's fuel demands
by more than 10%," that the number
of tankers necessary to fuel the fighting
fleet had been cut, and that the "cost
of the paint had been halved."

without a technical knowledge of steam
operation, and this is not possible with-
out automatic boiler controls. These con-
trols must be operated by an accelerator
pedal, and the driver must not even
know what is happening. This means
that the boiler pressure, temperature
and water level would have to be auto-
matically controlled, and each would de-
pend upon how much steam the engine
was using at any given time. Today,
most power stations have instruments
for this purpose, and the instruments
have been developed to a commercial
stage. These instruments could easily be
adapted to steam cars, and would be one
of the big developments which might
bring steam back as a means of power
for road travel.
Much can be learned by steam-car de-
signers from the advances which have
been made in power stations. In these
stations, turbines are used, whereas
steam cars would use reciprocating en-
gines. The principles are the same, how-
ever, and the superior efficiency of steam
over gasoline is great enough so that
steam should be able to work at least
on equal terms with gasoline engines.
(Continued from page 11)
The power stations which use steam
have made definite advances which
should be looked at here, at least briefly.
"In the first place, the weight of plant
has come down from over one hundred
pounds to under twenty pounds per
kilowatt. Thermal efficiencies have in-
creased per unit sold from 17 per cent in
1923 to 28 per cent in 1938. Steam
pressures at the beginning of the century
were of the order of 150 pounds per
square inch and temperatures not above
400 degrees fahrenheit. The figures for
modern American installations are re-
ported to be as high as 2,300 pounds
per square inch and 940 degrees fahren-
heit." 4
As was mentioned in a preceeding
paragraph, the gasoline engineers quick-
ly developed high-speed engines to re-
place the old heavy ones. In this man-
ner, the weight of the cars was reduced,
and a market was created which saved
the gasoline automobile from becoming
a costly, rich-man's toy. The same idea
can now be applied to the steam engine.
In 1900, the speed of steam engines was
about 500 revolutions per minute, while
today, speeds up to 3,600 revolutions
per minute are employed. There speeds
are for turbines, but equal speeds can be
obtained with reciprocating engines,
once the problem of balance is solved.
Engineers have solved the problem of
balance in gasoline engines running as
high as 6,000 revolutions per minute,
and there is no reason why the same
might not be done for steam.
Fuels to be used for heating the boiler
tubes have been the subject of much ex-
perimentation. Pulverized coal has come
into more and more use in power sta-
tions and in similar steam applications.
The general standard of particle size is
20 mesh, which is about 3/1000 inch.
Coal has, however, been reduced to as
low as 200 mesh. Engineers realize that
finer pulverization may be conducive to
improved combustion, and work is now
being done along these lines.
A still higher combustion efficiency
can be obtained through the use of
methane gas. In every ton of coal there
are 1000 cubic feet of methane gas in
adsorption. Engineers are now develop-
ing a technique for extracting methane
gas from coal without affecting the heat-

You feel as though you were right there at
the game — when you see it through RCA's
brilliant television.
Football fans as far as 250 miles away
from the stadium have enjoyed watching
many of the big games this fall through
NBC telecasts. And football fans become
television fans when they see how closely
the camera follows the ball.
At the game, the sensitive RCA Image
Orthicon television camera sees every line
plunge, kick, pass and run. It may be a
cloudy day or the sun may go down but
you still enjoy the bright sharpness of the
RCA Image Orthicon camera.
On the screen of your RCA Victor home
television receiver none of that bright
sharpness is lost.
For after you've tuned in the game, the
new RCA Victor "Eye Witness" Picture
Synchronizer automatically "locks" the pic-
ture in tune with the sending station-
eliminates any distortion—assures you of
clearer, steadier pictures.
For television at its best, as pioneered at
RCA Laboratories, you'll want the receiver

ing value of the coal. The cost of this
gas would be very low, and it should
greatly reduce running costs of steam
vehicles.
In addition to the two types of fuel
mentioned above, there is a large class
of liquefied gases which has not been
thoroughly explored. There seem to be
numerous possibilities along the line of
combustive fuels for use in steam road
vehicles. For, while costly, high-octane
fuels are being used by gasoline engines
today, the cheapest hydrocarbon fuel
can be used in a steam generator.5
One of the early successful cars was
the White steam car. It had a double-
cylindered steam engine placed in the
same position that the gasoline engines
of our modern cars occupy. This car
looked very much like the gasoline cars
of its day. The steam engine drove the
rear wheels by means of a rear axle, in
much the same way as our modern cars
operate. The car had no gears and no
clutch, for its speed was determined
solely by the speed of the engine.
The water for the boiler was carried
in a large tank in front of the dash-
board, and the supply of water to the
(Continued from pa%e 26)
boiler was automatic. The boiler was
fired by means of a gasoline burner, the
gasoline being supplied under pressure.6
By changing the pressure in the main
engine cylinder, this car could be made
to climb very steep hills. It could be
backed up by merely reversing the en-
gine. There were disadvantages, how-
ever, and one of the big problems was
the public's attitude towards operating
a high-pressure boiler. Another disad-
vantage was having to stop frequently
for water as well as being forced to wait
for the boiler to heat up before being
able to start the engine.
Around the year 1924, the Stanley
steam car was almost as popular as the
gasoline cars. It had all of the advan-
tages of the White car, and, in addition,
the engine was practically noiseless and
free from vibration. The car was ex-
tremely flexible, going from a full stop
to maximum speed through the control
of one lever. Again it failed, for much
the same reasons as the White car failed.
These reasons again were: the hesitancy
on the part of the public to operate a
high-pressure boiler, the time required
to generate steam pressure in a cold
boiler, and the necessity of keeping a
pilot light to start the heater.7
As a result of the disadvantages men-
tioned above, the second rise of steam as
a means of power for road travel came
to an end. Today, with the improve-
ments in weight reduction, fuels, engine
pseeds, and the general rise of efficiency
in steam practice, the steam car could
conceivably return. All that needs to be
done is for the steam engineers to use
the developments made in power sta-
tions an don the rail-roads, and supply
these developments to road vehicles.
These improvements, coupled with an im-
proved and cheaper fuel, could put the
team car in the position now held so ex-
clusively by the gasoline car.

• The Cinderella of Chesapeake Bay is a queer
looking craft. She has no bow, no stern, no engine,
no crew. Never weighs anchor to make a voyage.
But she has a purpose, and has served it well.
Largely because of her, a new fleet of ocean-
going passenger ships will have superstructures
built of aluminum. It reduces weight at the most
important place—"topside".
This is a dream come true for Alcoa engineers.
Eleven years ago they built this odd-shaped
aluminum test hull and anchored it in Chesapeake
Bay. Together with marine engineers and naval
architects, they watched to see the effect salt water
had on aluminum; whether it would prove sea-
worthy. And it did!
But there were other problems—for instance,
stresses topside, set up by the weaving and pound-
ing that a ship takes at sea. By building and test-
ing a model, Alcoa engineers found that the use
of aluminum in the superstructure greatly re-
duced the stresses. They likewise conferred on
plans and recommended materials.
So the ships were built. They are in the water
now being outfitted for their maiden voyages to
China—thanks to Cinderella and the"imagineers"
who dreamed of aluminum ships and then engi-
neered them into the water.
Doesn't a company that pursues an ideal with
such intensity stir your imagination? It's fun to
work with men of vision. Ideas click when men
with imagination plus engineering work with this
versatile metal, aluminum, and with the greatest
fund of aluminum knowledge in the world . . .

PROBLEM —You're designing a taxi-cab meter. You have worked out
the mechanism that clocks waiting time and mileage and totals the
charges. Your problem now is to provide a drive for the meter from some
operating part of the cab—bearing in mind that the meter must be
located where the driver can read it and work the flag. How would
you do it?
THE SIMPLE ANSWER
Use an S.S.White power drive flexible shaft. Connect one end to a
take-off on the transmission and the other to the meter. It's as simple as
that—a single mechanical element that is easy to install and will
operate dependably regardless of vibration and tough usage. That's
the way a leading taximeter manufacturer does it as shown below.
• • *
This is just one of hundreds of power drive and remote control prob-
lems to which S.S.White flexible shafts are the simple answer.
That's why every engineer should be familiar with the range and
scope of these "Metal Muscles" for me-
chanical bodies.

tion we are merely moving a collection
of electrons, and electrons in motion
constitute a current of electricity. So
the shot putter is really starting a cur-
rent of electricity. As I have pointed
out, a spring and a capacitor or con-
denser obey the same laws and, to a
considerable extent, mechanical friction
and electrical resistance act alike.
Why not make learning easy? Dy-
namics and electrical engineering are
not separate compartments of knowledge
but to a great extent are identical.
Friction is equivalent to resistance, mass
to inductance, and spring action to ca-
pacitance. The mathematical treatment
of the problems of starting a railroad
train with a constant draw-bar pull, of
starting a current in an inductive cir-
cuit (e.g. the ignition coil of an automo-
bile engine) or of determining the
change of temperature with time, of a
body to which heat is added at a constant
rate, is identical in all three instances.
If we know what happens when a weight
hung from a spring is subjected to a
periodic force, we know at once what
happens when a resistor, a capacitor
(or condenser) and an inductor are con-
nected in series across an alternating
current voltage. One who has studied
what happens in a transmission line is
prepared to understand why the draw
bars in a long train are sometimes pulled
out by the roots when only a moderate
jerk is given to the first car, or why
vibrations in a long narrow bridge may
build up to such an extent as to wreck
the bridge. (This actually happened a
few years ago). He would also know
that the hoary old tale of a violinist
bringing down a bridge by playing a
certain note is pure fiction. The only
successful use of this principle was
when Joshua brought down the walls of
Jericho by blowing a horn and this took
place long ago and far away.
moral
Every story should have a moral, so
here it is. Don't believe everything you
hear or read. Look for the "assump-
tions" back of the statement. Was the
assumption justified? If so, how far?
Be suspicious; it will pay you well. In
your own thinking examine well the
facts or assumptions upon which you
base your reasoning. If you do this
always, perhaps your thinking will get
you somewhere.

Plastic coating of metal parts expands the whole field of
applications for both metals and plastics. By varying
the chemical composition of the plastic an infinite
variety of new surfaces can be created for metals.
An essential element in the perfect union of metal and
plastic is heat—clean, dependable, accurately-controlled
heat—the kind obtained with modern Gas-fired ovens.
Experienced producers of plastic-coated metals, such
as Heremetal Company, Minneapolis, Minnesota, use

GAS for polymerization ovens because GAS insures the
uniform heat, rapid response to heat control, and exact
temperatures so essential to processing.
Where there's a difficult industrial heating problem
there's a job for GAS. In the fields of plastics, metal-
lurgy, chemistry, electronics, the productive flames of
GAS provide the most flexible, dependable heat source
for pioneering or productioneering.

Items of Interest to Students of Chemistry, Engineering, Physics, and Biology
Chemistry Provides New Colors for New Cars
In Detroit this spring, automotive engi-
neers and designers were shown a dozen
cars finished in glowing colors never be-
fore seen on any automobile—colors
that diffused and reflected light back to
the eye from within the finish instead of
from the surface.
These new "Duco" Metalli-Chrome
lacquers which attracted industry-wide
attention are expected to give new
beauty and durability to America's cars.
The story behind their development is
an interesting one.
New Techniques for Pigment
Preparation
As many commercial pigments are now
made, they are precipitated from chem-
ical solutions in the form of fine parti-
cles, which are then dried, ground and
reeround with a liquid vehicle to pro-
duce the final paint, enamel or lacquer.
The fineness of the particle-size largely
determines the luster of the finish. Al-
though mechanically ground pigment
particles can be made extremely fine,
they are not nearly as small as the par-
ticles originally precipitated.
A few years ago a program of research
was started by Du Pont scientists to
try to take advantage of the very fine
particles formed by precipitation. They
proposed to eliminate the drying and
grinding processes entirely — to trans-
fer the microscopically sized, precipita-
ted, hydrated pigment particles directly
from the mother solution to the lacquer
vehicle.
Extended study by organic and col-
loid chemists, physicists and chemical
engineers finally solved this problem.
The procedure consists of mixing the
wet pigment in a heavy-duty mill with
water-wet nitrocellulose.dibutyl phthal-
ate and castor oil. Dibutyl phthalate
forms a colloidal solution with nitro-
cellulose. The colloid absorbs the castor
oil and pigment, but eliminates the
major portion of the water as a sepa-
rate insoluble phase.

A New Range of Color Effects
After the method of transferring wet
pigment particles had been established,
the second development in this program
was the practical utilization of precipi-
tated ferric hydroxide. Although it had
been used for a long time as an inter-
mediate for the manufacture of dry fer-
ric oxide pigment, ferric hydroxide in
the wet form as a pigment had been ap-
plied only to a very limited extent and
its true value had gone unrecognized.
When used in conjunction with the new
process, wet ferric hydroxide produced
a lacquer of unusual brilliance and dur-
ability. In combination with other pig-
ments, a whole new range of color effects
became possible.
Because of their extremely small pig-
ment particle-size, the Metalli-Chromes
are somewhat translucent, having a dis-
tinctive, soft innerglow. This lustrous
depth isfurtherenhanced by introducing
into the film aluminum particles which
act like mirrors to reflect the light with-
in the finish.
Not only are these new lacquer fin-
ishes more lustrous and more beautiful,
but they arealso more durable, as proved
by four years of laboratory and road-
testing. "Duco" Metalli-Chrome lac-
quer is a worthy newcomer to the ever-
lengthening list of developments by
men of Du Pont that have helped in the
mass-production of automobiles and the
creation of new industries, new markets,
new jobs for millions of Americans.

With the advent of the industrial
revolution, mass production methods
increased in use, and the problem of
adequate, cheap power was first en-
countered. As labor saving devices be-
came more numerous, more power was
needed. At first, coal was principally
used but, today, hydroelectric power is
used whenever possible.
THE TECHNIC EXPLORES
(Continued from page 22)
Eastern Canada is fortunate in that,
though having little coal, it has a vast
network of rivers suitable for generating
hydroelectric power. The development
of hydroelectric plants at Niagara Falls
brought Canada into the industrial race
in the early part of this century. In-
dustries dependent upon electro-metal-
lurgical processes sprang up very rapid-
ly in this region, so rapidly that addi-
tional power facilities were necessitated.

coverage, with a sheath of rust-resistant metal . . . Second,
by electro-chemical action, or "sacrificial corrosion" That's
why industry has long depended on ZINC to stop rust—cut
costs—save materials. Heavy coatings pay—for the heavier
the coating, the better the protection, the longer the service
life and the lower the cost.

The power project on the Saguenay
River was a direct result of this need.
The existing power plants at Arvida,
site of the Saguenay project, and at
Shawinigan Falls were soon taxed to
their limit. New pot lines were erected
as last as possible but even these were
soon carrying top loads. In 1941, when
industry's demand exceeded the output
of existing hydroelectric stations, work
was started on the great Shipsaw No.
2 canal. In one year, the first of the
100.000 H.P. units was in operation.
The following year eleven additional
units were functioning, furnishing a
total of 1,200,00 H.P. of electrical
energy.
The abundance of low cost electric
power was an incentive in the estab-
lishment and development of the alu-
minum plants in this area. In 1900, on
the St. Maurice River at Shawinigan
Falls, the first aluminum plant in Can-

ada, and one of the first in the world
was erected. Although the production
and fabrication industries were firmly
established by 1939, the war demand
required immediate increases in output.
Between 1939 and 1944 the smelting
capacity was increased from 440,000
pounds of metal a day to 3,000,000
pounds daily. The greatest amount of
metal came from Arvida, in the heart of
the Saguenay River area, where is lo-
cated the largest single smelting plant
in the world.

are we going to make it—commercially?
What equipment will we need? What's
the best way to design the equipment?
Out of what materials shall it be made?
This is one type of fascinating prob-
lem that will be tackled and solved in
these engineering buildings which are
to be constructed in our new technical
and administrative center at Ham-
mond, Indiana, near Chicago. Mag-
nificently equipped, these buildings will
provide our engineers every facility for
taking their essential part in turning
test tube dreams into useful realities.
Here will be grouped engineers fol-
lowing many congenial pursuits; those
who design our manufacturing equip-
ment, those responsible for our main-
tenance, inspection and field engineer-
ing, and our cost engineering.
Here, too, a task force of research
engineers will work in modern labora-
tories. Some of the channels into which
their explorations will lead are:
Research in engineering materials, especially in metallurgy; physical
testing of construction materials; theoretical mechanics; applied me-
chanics, especially as it relates to the underlying principles of engi-
neering and the research tools needed by other divisions, and also the
industrial aspects and possibilities of nuclear energy; electronic de-
velopments; exploratory engineering and estimating associated with
the development of new processes and products.
These new engineering facilities will hum with such activities
and others vitally important.

and at the same time rather low in cost.
Ferrosilicon is manufactured by the
St. Lawrence Metal and Alloys Com-
pany, near the town of Beauharnois.
It also takes huge quantities of electri-
cal energy to produce this compound,
almost as much as aluminum requires.
Before the war only 35 tons of ferro-
silicon were produced daily by seven
furnaces. At the close of the war, by
using six additional furnaces, the output
had been increased to 75 tons a day.
Ferrosilicon is made with 50%, 75%,
and 98% silicon content, the 75%
grade being used in the manufacture of
magnesium.
Another product of electricity is cal-
cium carbide, itself unimportant but its
derivatives being extremely so, 250,000
tons of carbide being produced during
1942. Before World War I, the Shawin-
igan Chemicals Limited produced cal-
cium carbide and a few of its deriva-
tives. The demand for acetone, used in
the manufacture of cordite, a propul-
sion explosive, prompted the research
on a process for producing large quan-
tities of acetone. With only some data
THE TECHNIC EXPLORES
(Continued from page 36)
from German patents to guide them, a
group of Canadian chemists developed
a process in a short time, making the
Allies independent of Germany for its
acetone.
New acetylene derivatives, a product
of calcium carbide, were supplied by
the Shawinigan Chemicals Limited in
the following war era. RDX, a super-
explosive, is one of the irportant deriva-
tives with an outstanding share of de-
velopment being done in the labs of
Shawinigan Chemicals.
The striking progress of electrochem-
ical industries in Canada is indicative
of an advancing trend in all countries
which have a highly developed manu-
facturing system. Whether produced by
steam or water power, electricity seems
to be the cheapest and most convenient
source of energy available to present
day manufacturers.
silicone resins
You can throw away your polishing
rag and cease worrying about the paint
job on your car when lifetime finishes
for automobiles are perfected by the
use of new silicone resins. Progress be-
ing made in the development of sili-
cones, the new materials derived from
sand, indicates that within five years,
cars, refrigerators, electric ranges, and
hospital equipment will be finished with
a silicone paint that will retain its orig-
inal color and gloss permanently. In
addition it is expected that brighter and
more clear colors will be obtained with
silicone materials.
Tests of the paint show that the sili-
cone product is highly resistant to severe
weather conditions, chemicals, and heat.
Tests, in which silicone-treated panels
have been immersed in acid and alkali
solutions, reveal that the new product
will retain all its original characteristics
while materials now commonly used
would deteriorate.
Application of the silicone paint to
refrigerators, ranges, and hospital equip-
ment would prevent discoloration fre-
quently caused by hot greases, fruit
juices, iodine and other chemicals. The
new paint is only one of many develop-
ments being conducted with silicone ma-
terials. Other products include silicone
rubber, oils greases, and resins. The pri-
mary feature of the materials is their
ability to withstand high temperatures.

about the TIMKEN BEARING
ESSENCE OF PERFORMANCE

Timken introduced the tapered principle over 48 years ago to
obtain an anti-friction bearing with the ability to carry radial
loads, thrust loads or any combination of the two. During the
ensuing long period of engineering development and experi-
ence, a constant refinement of design has taken place, making
the Timken Bearing of today supreme in performance.
Here are the three most important features exemplified in the
design of the Timken Bearing.
LTRUE ROLLING MOTION
This basic necessity is accomplished by making all lines coincident
with the tapered surfaces of the rollers, cup and cone, meet at a
common apex on the axis of the bearing, Figure 1. True rolling
motion always has been incorporated in the Timken Bearing.

2. POSITIVE ROLLER ALIGNMENT
During the development of the Timken Bearing, as speed, load and
accuracy requirements increased, various methods were used to
stabilize the rollers and prevent them skewing on the raceways. The
problem finally was solved by so designing the roll end and cone rib,
that when generated during bearing production, perfectly smooth,
mated working surfaces are obtained at the contact area, which keeps
the rollers positively and permanently aligned on the raceways, re-
duces friction at this vital point to the minimum and eliminates
initial wear. The light areas on the ends of the rollers in Figure 2
show generated contact of roller ends with cone rib.

3. MULTIPLE PERFORATED CAGE
All the openings in the Timken Bearing cage, Figure 3, are stamped
out in one operation by means of multiple perforating dies made
to extremely close precision tolerances. This assures exact center-
to-center spacing of the rollers around the periphery of the race-
ways, so that every roller takes its full share of the load when the
bearing is in operation.

A thorough knowledge of Timken Bearing design and application
will be one of your best assets when you graduate to enter the
professional engineering field. Begin to acquire it now.

The Case of The Neglected Engineer
Have you ever participated in a dis-
cussion among several people of varied
tastes and education, and seen how, in
general, the engineer in that group lapses
into silence and is sloughed out of the
current of the conversation as soon as
the topic changes from science and mec-
hanisms to music, books, politics, or
any subject that is removed from his
practical work? Or, being an engineer-
ing student, have you ever been unable
and unwilling to enterjnto honest at-
tempts at intelligent discussion of non-
engineering subjects—religion, art, eco-
nomics, education? What is wrong?
Are these other people wasting their
time and energy talking about unim-
portant things which can give no one
any real satisfaction, or are there some
important defects in the engineer's ed-
ucation?
Has the engineer any logical defense
of his all-too-frequent ignorance of sub-
jects which, though vitally important in
our social and economic worlds, do not
directly help him to solve his practical
engineering problems? The answer is
that engineers have been sorely neg-
lected, both by themselves and by their
educational curricula, in obtaining a
well-balanced education. The engineer
spends four and one-half years cram-
ming his mind full of facts and figures
about mathematics, mechanisms, proper
design of engineered products, and many
other things closely related to his chosen
field of specialization. He seems to have
no time to pursue the study of anything
not strictly a necessary part of his fund
of engineering knowledge. In short, he
becomes a walking, animated engineer-
ing handbook. His material success de-
pends upon how quickly and correctly
he can apply his knowledge of engineer-
ing in the solution of specific problems
which confront him and in organizing
and administering engineering projects
which are assigned to him.
His college program provides him with
a scanty opportunity to apply himself in
studying non-engineering subjects. His
instruction in English compositions is
frugal, to say the least; he has only two
semesters to "learn" economics; he has
very few elective hours in his assigned
curriculum. He usually learns little or
nothing about history, social and eco-
nomic development of our civilization,
political science, business administration
—fields of study which each contain vast
amounts of information pertinent to suc-
cessful and happy living.
The engineering colleges, despite their
inclusion of theory and historical en-
gineering development in their programs,
are little more than vocational schools.
They grant degrees for the engineering
student's efforts which have qualified
those students as competent technicians.
Most colleges make no attempt to in-
clude a liberal arts program in their en-
gineering curricula, yet they like to
think that they are providing responsi-
ble industrial leaders of the next genera-
tion.
Leaders for what? Is it a mark of
distinction for engineers and scientists
to acquire the technical know-how to
build atom bombs that would destroy
whole cities? Shall we award them gold
stars, with sapphire clusters, for having
developed poison gases, powerful bomb-
ers, improved artillery—all of which
serve mercifully to divorce men from
their worldly problems? Is it a sign of
progress and a mark of distinction for
engineers to organize mass-production
methods and huge factory layouts, with
the accompanying population shifts and
social maladjustments?
Or, shall we admit that too many en-
gineers are socially stupid? In their
narrow-minded selfishness and zeal to
make outstanding improvements in en-
gineered products and manufacturing
processes, they are too often ignorant of
the immediate social and economic ef-
fects of their work. Engineering, at best,
can serve to better our working condi-
tions and standard of living only to the
extent that we are given added leisure
time which we can devote to solving the
primary problems of our time—unem-
ployment, the need for more and better
education, selfishness, greed, and many
others.
Where, then, does the responsibility
lie, for liberalizing and extending the en-
gineer's education? The immediate re-
sponsibility for achieving a well-rounded
educational experience must be borne by
each individual engineer and engineering
student. Failing to be required to accu-
mulate the needed social and economic
knowledge for college credit, as necessary
prerequisites of an engineering degree,
he must strive to fill in the gaps by
himself. A planned program of reading
and study, to be continued after college,
would be a great step in the right direc-
tion. The engineering student can get
advice from informed sources on cam-
pus, in planning any program of study
in addition to his regular work. He may
even choose to stay an extra year in
school, following a balanced program of
elective studies. In any case, since he
is already busy mastering engineering
courses, he would require exceptional
ambition to follow through successfully
any added studies.
Several large engineering colleges
have already adopted five-year pro-
grams, spreading out the engineer's for-
mal education by allotting twenty to
twenty-five per cent of the total in-
creased number of credit hours to cul-
tural courses—English, history, eco-
nomics, philosophy, art, religion, and
other elections. Let us recognize that
this additional study does not merely
provide recreation for the engineering
student; nor are these courses to be con-
sidered ineffectual. Rather, let us admit
the urgent necessity of providing cul-
turally-balanced, morally-sound leaders
for a world already badly torn up by
the forces of materialistic power which
have completely lacked any moral pur-
pose in the application of that power.
Let us urge, too, that the leaders of the
University of Michigan be foresighted
enough to realize the need for improving
our program of study and to follow the
lead of other engineering colleges in the
country.

... a great name in research with a big future in CHEMISTRY

PLASTICS ... SOLVING AN
ELECTRICAL PROBLEM BUILT
AN INDUSTRY
Electrical necessity was one of
the mothers of plastics invention.
The necessity was to insulate elec-
tric power so that it could be put to
work when needed.
General Electric's
plastics story began
back in 1894. A mold-
ing process acquired
from a lead pencil
manufacturer was
used by the 3-year-old
company to make arc lamp carbons
out of lampblack-impregnated
potter's clay—an ancient plastic.
Before the turn of the century,
General Electric found more and
more uses for the process—molding
rubber, shellac, copal and other
natural resins into insulating parts
for apparatus. Hut it was evident
that G-E Research would have to
find better, more dependable, more
moldable materials with which to
insulate the complex apparatus
and appliances envisioned.
Chemistry Solves the Problem
When needed .v &gt;st
1 by the infant elec-
trical industry, chem-
istry synthesized
phenolic resin and
^ brought it to com-
mercial production.
By 1912 General Electric was
molding this new synthetic into
stronger, better-looking insulating
parts with electrical properties
which chemistry brought under
accurate control.
Chemistry, of course, became an
increasingly important phase of


G-E Research. New synthetics and
new polymers of interest to the
whole field of chemistry began
coming from General Electric Lab-
oratories.
G-E Chemistry Helps Build
the Plastics Industry
Phenolic molding
| and laminating were
expanded rapidly to
satisfy General Elec-
tric's own increasing
needs. Soon it be-
came possible to accommodate
more and more outside customers
who were drawn by the develop-
ment of G-E techniques in handling
new materials. Plastics, as they
came to be called, were becoming
one of chemistry's important con-
tributions to industry. Plastics
parts, which could be molded in a
single operation, were destined to
save millions of man-hours of
machining and to make thousands
of products more attractive, safer,
and easier to use.
By 1940, General Electric oc-
cupied a unique position in the
plastics field. It was the only unit
engaged in the three principal divi-
sions of the plastics industry—raw
material manufacture, molding,and
laminating. General Electric be-
came the world's largest manufac-
turer of finished plastics products.
Tremendous Trifles for
War Production
This position was consolidated
during the war. General Electric
was called upon to produce more
than 14,000 different plastics prod-
ucts—a large part of them being
technical items of the greatest
precision—all of them tremendous
trifles vital to the production of all
kinds of war equipment.
There was a great increase in
General Electric's capacity to pro-
duce plastics products. Even more
significant was the development of
new manufacturing processes, new
plastics materials, and new con-
cepts of the usefulness of plastics
in the world.
To coordinate expansion not only
in plastics, but in other chemical
fields, the Chemical Department of
General Electric has now been estab-
lished ax a separate organization
within the Company. A great new
name in chemistry. The Chemical
Department of General Electric has
its own laboratories . . . administers
eight factories of the G-E Plastics
Divisions and G-E Resin &amp; Insula-
tion Materials Division . . . and is
building new chemical laboratories
and plants — one for the commercial
production of silicones. The Chemical

A message la students of chemistry mid chemical engineering from
DR. C. G. suns
Vice President and Director, G-E Research Laboratory.
An essential ingredient of G-E Research is the fresh view-
point of young chemists and chemical engineers. That is the
reason why they are always welcome -more of them every
year—to work with us to solve the many problems of our
expansion in chemistry.

The Romans smugly thought the icy barrier of the Alps im-
passable. But Hannibal turned the paralyzing cold to his
advantage. He had water poured into the crevices of road-
blocking boulders. The expansion of the freezing water "made
little ones out of big ones"—and another road led to Rome.
Low temperature, which worked to Hannibal's advantage,
is a distinct disadvantage to operating machinery. Under
low temperature conditions, some steels that may perform
perfectly at ordinary temperatures, develop unsuspected
weakness. There is always danger of a parts failure
under such conditions.
One way to assure good performance at low temperatures
is to specify molybdenum steels. Good hardenability plus
freedom from temper brittleness give them good low tem-
perature impact strength. They are a precaution it pays not
to ignore. Practical working data are available on request.

AID TO INDUSTRY
Research by a great many institutions, each con-
tributing its might, has aided our general progress.
With the growing importance of research in in-
dustry came recognition by the colleges and univer-
sities of this country of the part which they might
well take in assisting in research programs. The vast
facilities of these institutions, while devoted pri-
marily to educational pursuits, might also be used
to excellent advantage in research problems, to the
mutual benefit of both industry and education.

IN THE GAY NINETIES

by
BENJAMIN F. BAILEY
professor emeritus of electrical engineeri
Would you like for a moment to turn
back the pages of time and see what
happened to a student when he studied
.engineering just before the turn of the
century? My information comes largely
from my own experience in the Engi-
neering College of the University of
Michigan from 1894 to 1898.
At that time, engineering was just
beginning to assume the status of a
profession. Of course, there had been
engineers since the dawn of history.
Some one had to direct the building of
the pyramids of Egypt and the aque-
ducts of Rome. But these men were not
thought of as belonging to a learned
profession and, of course, were not given
the educational advantages of modern
engineers. Moreover, the major achieve-
ments of engineering were still in the
future.
Civil and mechanical engineering as
professions were first recognized about
200 years ago. Some of the great elec-
trical discoveries were made about 100
years ago but electrical engineering is
little more than 50 years old. If the
whole history of man could be com-
pressed into 24 hours, the development
of electrical engineering would require
only the last four seconds of the day.
By the year 1895, engineering had
progressed to such a point that we had
steam engines, steam boats, railroads,
running water in our homes, electric
street-cars, and many of the comforts of
life. Central stations for the generation
of electric power had existed for about
15 years, the telephone was 20 years of
age, the telegraph about 40 years. The
lightning rod had been known since the
time of Benjamin Franklin, and one of
the most useful of all electrical devices,
the mariner's compass, dates back to the
beginning of history. However, electric
lighting in the home was practically un-
known and the cost per unit of light was
at least ten times as great as it is today.
Incidentally, I did all my studying in
college by the light of a kerosene lamp,
and as far as I know, this was true of
all my fellow students. Electric street-
cars, however, had driven out the old
horse-drawn cars and about 1900, elec-
Benjamin F. Bailey
trie interurban railroads began to appear
all over the country.
As prime movers, we had steam en-
gines and water wheels. Gas and gaso-
line engines were known but were little
used, and the Diesel was still to be in-
vented. The steam turbine was known
in theory but was not used as a serious
source of power until much later. The
automobile existed only in the minds of
a few crazy inventors and the airplane
was only a dream. "You might as well
try to fly" was a common expression.
The telephone was fundamentally
much the same then as now but the
number in use has increased tremen-
dously. In Detroit, there was only one
central station and long distance service
was unknown. The telephone user at
that time could talk to a few thousand
people, and those near at hand. Today,
he can talk to millions all over the
civilized world.
The discovery of X-Rays was an-
nounced in 1895 and I, at least, thought
it only another newspaper yarn. Today
it is invaluable in so many ways that
even a list of its users would be too
long. "Wireless telegraphy" was first
known about 1900. Today, the wonders
of radio are well known to all of us.
If a student had been told in 1895 that
he would some day be able to talk
across the ocean, he would hardly have
believed it. The accomplishments of
radar are even more unbelievable. The
science of electronics was not dreamed
of and I need not take time to tell of
the wonders it has brought to pass and
of its even greater promise for the fu-
ture.
Professional training in other lines
has not stood still. Up to about 1850,
a medical education required two years,
in 1895 four years and now, seven plus
an internship for one year and, in the
case of specialists, added years of study.
A similar change has taken place in
the education of the lawyer. In my
student days the "laws" seemed to have
a very easy time of it. The course re-
quired only two years and the student
went directly from high school to the
law school. Moreover, the general im-
pression was that they did not have to
work very hard after they were in. To-
day, in the better law schools, the stu-
dent must obtain a college degree as well
as a degree from the law school and
in all he has to study for seven years
after leaving high school. Even then,
he has one more hurdle to pass; he
must take a bar examination before he
can practice law. The prospective
physician likewise must pass a state ex-
amination after he has obtained his
M.D.
Engineering educators have long felt
the need of more time to train engineer-
ing students. In the past 50 years, the
body of scientific information that the
young graduate should have has in-
creased many fold. In addition, the im-
portance of turning out a broadly edu-
cated man, rather than a narrow tech-
nician is being more and more recog-
nized. From time to time, efforts have
been made to lengthen the engineering
course to six years. Few people remem-
ber that here at Michigan we had a six-
year course some 20 years ago. It was
not required; the students could elect
either the usual four-year course or the
new six-year course, but so far as I can

rockets
The atmosphere, according to Aris-
totle, consists of three parts; a layer of
air close to the surface of the earth, a
cold layer called the stratosphere, and
a final one surrounding the fiery heaven-
ly bodies. Today, after twenty-two
centuries, man is verifying Aristotle's
theories through tests with jet-propelled
airplanes and high-altitude sounding
rockets.
Rockets, like so many other techni-
cal advances, have received their
greatest impetus from warfare. The
Chinese are known to have used a
rocket-arrow in battle as early as 1232
A.D., but it was not until 1780 that the
Occident found rocket-weapons to be
the equal of artillery. It was in this
year that the troops of an Indian prince
first used rockets effectively against
British forces. The incident stimulated
British rocket experiments, and in the
early 1800's, William Congreve devel-
oped the rocket-artillery which was used
in the war of 1812, and immortalized
by Francis Scott Key in our National
Anthem.
the reaction
Sir Isaac Newton set down, in 1686,
his famous Laws of Motion, and it is
the third law—stating that to every
action there is an equal and opposite
reaction—which explains the principle
of rocket operation. An explosion, or
a series of explosions, within the rocket
drives the gaseous products of combus-
tion from the rear of the unit at high
pressure and velocity. It is the reaction
of the rocket itself to the motion of
these gases which provides the driving
force. Thus the rocket need not be
backed up against a wall for a good
start, for action of the gases after they
leave the rocket is almost negligible. A
gun does not kick because the bullet
hits a wall nearby; it kicks from the
force of the explosion, and nothing
more.
Obviously, then, a rocket should work
best in a vacuum, where back-pressure
limiting the velocity of the exhaust gases

is not present. The Army Air Forces*
recent experiments show that rocket-
and jet-propelled units do perform most
efficiently at high velocities and high
altitudes.
rocket experiments
Many tests were made in Europe, dur-
ing the nineteenth century, attempting
to drive balloons and surface vehicles
with rockets. By 1930, all conceivable
types of vehicles, from automobiles and
boats to monorail-cars and ice-sleds, had
been driven successfully, but it was
found that such power plants were ex-
pensive and inefficient, and during the
30's these experiments were dropped in
favor of aerial rockets for stratosphere
exploration.
Dr. Robert H. Goddard, the fore-
most American rocket experimenter, had
discovered that liquid fuels were more
suitable than solid ones, and the Amer-
ican Rocket Society's test rockets were
powered by various propellant-oxygen
mixtures. Many hydrocarbon propel-
lants were tried, including acetylene,
gasoline, kerosene, and the alcohols.
The oxygen for combustion of the fuel
is carried in the cold liquid state, and the
pressure of the gas produced from its
own boiling at atmospheric temperature
is used to force it into the combustion
chamber in a continuous stream of liq-
uid. When the rocket is launched, the
fuel mixture must be ignited with a
powder fuse, but the heat of the explo-
sion soon raises the combustion cham-
ber to a temperature such that gases
are ignited upon entrance. The gaseous
products are directed rearward through
a nozzle, and it is the rocket's reaction
to the motion of the exhaust gases
which drives it forward.
jet propulsion
The difference between rocket- and
jet-propulsion is all a matter of oxygen;
the rocket, as pointed out above, carries
its own liquid oxygen supply, while jet-
propelled planes scoop their oxygen
from the atmosphere. The jet has been
compared to "a stove-pipe with a fire
in it." Air enters the front of the tube
(it may or may not be controlled by a
shutter arrangement as in the German
V-l), and mixes with the fuel in the
combustion chamber. Here it is ignited
by a spark, and the gases shoot from
the rear of the unit just as in a rocket.
Without any equipment for compres-
sing the air entering the forward end,
only the pressure due to velocity is
available to aid the explosion in push-
ing the plane ahead. This type (used
in the V-l Robomb) is popularly known
as the ''ramjet." When a rotary turbo-
generator unit operates within the jet
engine, compressing the intake air to
increase the pressure drop and efficiency,
the unit is called a ''turbojet." This
engine is the one used in the majority
of jet propelled aircraft today. When
comparing the efficiency of the jet en-
gine with that of the conventional in-
ternal combustion type, we must re-
member that the jet was designed for
high-speed operation. In the internal
combustion range of speed, from 0 to
550 mph, the jet is not a serious rival
to the familiar motor. This fact, plus
the heat of the jet blast, will preclude
its use in surface vehicles. At 550 mph
the two types of motors are equally effi-
cient, and above that speed, the jet
is supreme, with high efficiency and
good high-altitude operation. P-80 pilots

are proud of the fuel-saving habits of
their craft at high speeds, and of its
maneuverability at high altitudes.
The first propellerless jet-propelled
plane to fly successfully was an Italian
model, tested at Milan in August, 1940.
With the announcement of this revolu-
tionary flight, the major nations took
an active interest in jet propulsion.
The American P-80 Shooting Star may
be the trimmest of the jet-propelled air-
craft, but the British Gloster Meteor IV
holds the world's speed record, 616.4
mph. Our own Republic Thunderjet
was designed to beat that record, and
may soon do so. Those who have seen
any of these planes in operation will
testify that their great speed and silent
flight make them excellent tactical
weapons.
the V-2
The first appearance of rockets in
warfare—rockets as Buck Rogers' fans
recognize them—was the second German
"Vengeance Weapon," the V-2. Com-
pared to the previous types, or even to
the ramjet-propelled V-l, this was a
stupendous weapon. It was 46 feet
long, 5% feet in diameter, and weighed
nearly fourteen tons. And most impor-
tant: it was rocket-propelled. The V-2
can rise vertically to a height of 114
miles, and when fired at distant targets,
it has an effective radius of 300 miles.
In long range flight, the V-2 attains a
speed of 3500 miles per hour during the
65 second operating period of its rocket
motor. When the motor shuts down,
with its fuel gone, the rocket decelerates
but continues on its trajectory, con-
trolled by a gyro-mechanism. Consider-
ing the tremendous size and cost of the
V-2 rocket, it is surprising that its ex-
plosion is smaller than that of the V-l.
This fact has led many experts to be-
lieve that this guided missile was meant
to be the first German atom weapon.
It is believed that Nazi atomic re-
search failed to keep pace with rocket
development, and the perfected V-2
rocket carried a war-head of low-grade
chemical explosives. It is impossible to
predict what the effect of the V-2 might
have been with an atom bomb in its
« nose.
american guided missiles
The Army Air Forces first became
interested in rocket research in 1939.
An intensive program of experiments
was followed at California Institute of
Technology, and the "WAC Corporal"
rocket, which was tested with the re-

constructed V-2's at White Sands Prov-
ing Ground recently, was the result of
this work. In addition to the Ford-
built American equivalent of the V-l,
our scientists have perfected many types
of guided missiles, including bombs for
both gliding and dropping, controlled by-
fantastic assortments of radio and radar
gear. We may assume that the United
States is keeping up with all other na-
tions in such developments, but we may
still wonder whether our nation is ade-
quately protected, electronically or
otherwise, from offensive attack with
such weapons.
supersonics
The speed of sound, 760 mph, has
always been the goal of aircraft de-
signers. Now that planes have been
built which are capable of such speeds,
it has been found that queer things hap-
pen to those which fly faster than 600
mph. Their control surfaces become in-
effective and may collapse, due to ''com-
pressibility" shock waves which form
at the leading edge of the wing. Jet-
propelled craft can reach farther into
this transonic region than propeller
types, due to their cleaner streamlining.
But the AAF wanted a plane to cross
this "shock wall," extending from 600
to 900 mph, and to explore supersonic
speeds up to 1700 mph.
For this purpose the Bell XS-1, a
rocket-powered airplane, has been de-
signed, to be carried to a high altitude,
released, and rocketed into the thin air
of the stratosphere, where supersonic
speed tests will be carried out. In spite
of the 60° below zero temperatures of
the stratosphere, the pilot will need a
refrigeration system in his cockpit, for
"skin-friction" at supersonic speeds may
heat the cockpit to 400° F. The plane
will be flown in early morning or late
afternoon to minimize the effects of the
sun's radiation, and scientists predict
that the pilot will be able to see first
magnitude stars at the top of his climb.
Carrying its own oxygen supply, this
airplane will not depend upon the at-
mosphere for its oxygen, as do conven-
tional motors, or jets. Perhaps all high
speed planes of the future will be pow-
ered by rocket motors, and the XS-1
may be the forerunner of a "rocket to the
moon."

With such successes in the field of
rocket design as the V-2 and the XS-1,
the public is not so ready to scoff at the
possibilities of travel in outer space as

PROCESSING DEPARTMENT
Row upon row of glistening modern
machine tools are eloquent testimony
to the efficiency of Metal Processing
Department officials in taking advan-
tage of the "opportunity of a lifetime"
presented to them by the close of World
War II. The value of instructional
equipment received without cost during
the past summer and fall from the U.S.
Army Ordnance Department has been
placed at several hundred thousand dol-
lars. The new equipment includes ma-
chine tools, cutters and inspection equip-
ment.
The donations were authorized under
a law permitting the Ordnance Depart-
ment, upon termination of war con-
tracts, to &gt; present equipment to educa-
tional institutions to be used for pre-in-
duction training. The donations were
made with the approval of the state
superintendent of public instruction and
the training officer of the army service
command district.
Much of the new equipment has now
been installed in the metal processing
department laboratories located in the
south wing of the East Engineering
Building. Some fifty machine tools of
modern design, having a total value of
about a quarter of a million dollars,
were received by the department, ac-
cording to Prof. Orlan W. Boston, head
of the department, who spent two
months in Detroit negotiating for the
equipment. Most of them, he empha-
sizes, have been used less than two years
and are in excellent condition. Some
were practically new with little use in
industry and few show the hard physi-
cal wear-and-tear of mass production.
Although the new equipment was ob-
tained without cost from the Ordnance
Department, the metal processing de-
partment has encountered numerous
headaches as a result of the gift. It was
necessary for department workers to
clean all pieces of equipment thoroughly,
as they had been coated with a thick
grease for protection during shipping
and storage. Several of the machines
weigh more than 17.000 pounds. In
some cases workers were forced to tear
by

down part of the laboratory walls in
order to install the new machines.
Shipping costs for all the equipment
were paid by the department. The
greatest expense incurred by the depart-
ment involved the electric power sup-

ply. Department and electrical workers
spent many long summer evenings on
the electrical connections.
According to Prof. Boston, the large
variety of equipment received by the
metal processing department will make
it possible to improve and extend courses
coordinating design, material and manu-
facturing methods.
Prof. Boston believes that the courses
in production engineering offered here
are more extensive than those of most
schools. For evidence to support this
claim he points to the large number of
graduate students being sent to Michi-
gan bv other countries to studv in this
field.'
"Since our purpose is one of teaching
basic principles underlying production,
not of production itself," he says, we
are not interested in obtaining dupli-
cates of one type of machine. It has
been our aim to obtain as many different
types of machine tools as possible in-
order to illustrate several methods of
design and production by which it is
possible to produce component parts."
Many manufacturers of machine tools
have voluntarily presented the metal
processing department with types of
machines which the department did not
already possess in order to further com-
plete the representative array of equip-
ment now available in the laboratories.
Metal processing department officials
are quick to emphasize that their ob-
jective has not yet been attained. They
estimate that it will be two to five years
before all equipment will be utilized to
the fullest advantage. The delay can
be attributed to the lack of certain
equipment, a burdened staff and the
necessity for maintaining instruction
while changes are being made.
Addition of the vast quantity of new
equipment, nevertheless, was well-
timed. The metal processing depart-
ment has been faced during the past
term with an enrollment 60 percent
greater than that of last spring and
more than twice the enrollment of any
term previous to that of last spring.
In order to accommodate the tre-
mendous increase in enrollment the de-
partment has been forced to schedule a
total of 33 night class hours a week in
addition to regularly scheduled classes.
Metal Processing 2, required of all
engineers, has been most affected by the
large enrollment. During the past term
31 three-hour laboratory sections for
this course, dealing with forging, weld-
ing and heat-treating of steel, have been
scheduled. The laboratory periods ex-
tend from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. frequently
overlapping each other. A total of 21
recitation sections are taught in this
course, seven of them in the evening.
The transformation of the metal proc-
essing department laboratories has not
been limited to the addition of new
machinery. Aisles and working space,
previously darkened, have been painted
according to a definite scheme of illu-
mination. Laboratory walls have been
painted in a gradually ascending scale
of illumination with light blue-green at
the base and a lighter green color at the
top. Ceilings have been painted light
green or buff and the floors have been
completely covered with light gray
paint.

painting scheme will result in tremen-
dous improvement in the illumination
of the laboratories. He emphasizes that
good illumination is important not only
as a controlling factor in the quality
of work produced, but also as a safety
precaution.
The machine tools themselves have
been dressed up for the occasion. Or-
dinarily drab and bulky machines have
been converted to colorful and pleasant-
appearing equipment through the care-
ful application of focal and eye-rest
colors, designed to separate the operat-
ing parts of the machinery from the
stationary parts and from the parts be-
ing fabricated. Following techniques
developed in industry during the war,
department workers have painted the
bases of all machines green, all moving
parts yellow, electrical connections red
and the working areas a buff color. This
formula, tested by wartime industry,
proved valuable in decreasing eye-
fatigue and at the same time increasing
efficiency morale and safety. In the
metal processing department labora-
tories, the change is expected to facili-
tate the study of the operation of elec-
tric, hydraulic, pneumatic and mechani-
cal devices.
In an effort to modernize their labo-
ratories still further, the department
has abandoned the old power transmis-
sion system which utilized line shafting,
belts and ceiling pulleys to drive the
machines. Now each machine will draw
its own power supply from an electrical
power inlet. Most of the old-type ma-
chines have been sold to provide funds
for the installation of the new machine
tools. Each new machine tool has its
own self-contained electrical motor.
These motors range in power capacity
from two to three to twenty horsepower.
Many of the machines have more than
one motor and up to five or six. In
many cases it was necessary for depart-
ment workers to install transformers to
step up the regular voltage supplied by
the University. Some machines are now
idle because of the difficulty of obtain-
ing transformers.
The types of machinery recently re-
ceived by the metal processing depart-
ment represent a definite trend in the
emphasis upon production engineering
courses. Previously courses were based
70-80 percent upon the tool-room func-
tions of machines and 20-30 percent on
production facilities. At that time the
department's machine tool laboratories
contained mostly lathes, Universal mill-
ing machines, grinders, shapers and drill
presses. Now, Prof. Colwell of the de-
partment estimates that the courses are
based 20-30 percent on tool room prac-
tice and almost 80 percent on produc-
tion refinement. As a result the depart-
ment has sought to obtain turret lathes
of a wide variety of designs, automatic
screw machines, all types of gear cutting
equipment, broaching machines, and sur-
face, cylindrical, thread and tool
grinders. Metal processing department
officials believe that the function of an
engineering college in shop practice
should be to acquaint the prospective
engineer with production facilities, and
uring unit outside Washington to relieve
congestion. The inspection training pro-
gram was discontinued after about 18
months, and the laboratory was trans-
ferred to Detroit when war production
there reached such a peak that it was
impractical to maintain the measuring
laboratory at any distance. When the
Detroit Ordnance branch was disbanded
following the war. much of the equip-
ment was placed in custody of the Uni-
versity of Michigan under a "transfer
of accountability." This "leased" equip-
ment now forms the major part of im-
portant and valuable measuring facili-
ties maintained by the metal processing
department. Although the theoretical

not to train machinists. They point
out that, since the engineer will be en-
gaged either in the design or administra-
tion of production, he must have suffi-
cient knowledge of production equip-
ment to be able to design functionally as
well as for quality and low cost.
Although the factory order of pre-
fabrication, fabrication and inspection
must occasionally be modified because
of teaching expedience, the department's
courses include casting, forging, weld-
ing, machining, heat-treating and finish-
ing. Inspection is a vital step that must
precede and follow these operations.
A great part of the facilities of the
Gauge Laboratory, an important part
of the production engineering courses,
are also the result of the war emergency.
The Gauge Laboratory was set up in
1936 in collaboration with the Army
Ordnance Department for peacetime
summer training of army personnel and
for the purpose of establishing a meas-
basis of measurement are gauge blocks
carefully preserved in Washington, the
practical basis of reference in the Gauge
Laboratory is the wave length of light.
With the aid of spectrometers and other
measuring devices, department students
are able to measure accurately within
five millionths of an inch. The theoreti-
cal limit of accuracy is about two mil-
lionths of an inch.
Through the efforts of metal process-
ing department officials, a revolution in
machinery, inspection equipment and
laboratory appearance has taken place.
But they want it known that the job
is not done. "The job is not yet com-
pleted," Prof. Boston says, "but many
returning grads are surprised and
pleased to see that the opportunity
created only by a world war has been
taken advantage of to such an extent as
to provide an abundance of the latest
type of machinery for the engineering
student."

jake
Jacob Eichorn's membership in the
impressive number of honoraries at-
tested to by the several keys affixed to
his fob chain is sufficient proof to es-
tablish that he has acquired the tech-
nical ''know how" in his field of chem-
ical engineering.
Jake is twenty-two years old and hails
from Saginaw, Mich. While in high
school, he not only was a very success-

Jacob Eichorn
ful student but also demonstrated his
athletic ability by becoming a three-
year letterman in track and captain of
his team. It was in an antediluvian lab
in high school while getting his first
taste of chemistry, that Jake made up
his mind to attend the University of
Michigan and to study chemical en-
gineering.
With a steady wake of preparatory
education behind him, Jake passed un-
der our revered Engineering Arch for
the first time in the fall of 1942 and
charted his course in the direction of
chemical engineering.
In a short time, Jake's potentialities
were recognized and he became a mem-
ber of the freshman honorary, Phi Eta
Sigma. Always one for broadening his
college life, and intensely disliking the
name tag "just knowing engineering"
that some engine folk wear. Jake con-
tinued his interest in sports and other
college activities.
Maintaining a high grade-average in
his studies, Jake subsequently became
a member of Phi Lambda Upsilon. the
chemistry honorary, and at the present
time is President of that organization.
By the time he was a senior, he was
sporting on the aforementioned key-
chain not only the coveted bent of Tau
Beta Pi but also the mark distinctive of
Sigma Psi. In addition, he was elected
to the all-campus honorary, Ph' Kappa
Phi. Last June the goal to which he had
conscientiously aspired was realized
when he received his B.S. in Chem.
Eng. He is at present working on his
master's degree.

Don DeGraaf hails from Grand
Rapids, where he graduated from
Christian High School in January of
1944.
His next step was to enter Calvin Col-
lege, in the same city. He did not re-
main there more than one semester,
however, as he joined the Navy shortly
after matriculating. Calvin's loss was
Michigan's gain as Don was assigned to
the V-12 unit here at Michigan, and
joined us in July of that year. Don re-
mained here in that program till it
closed down in August, at which time he
was discharged.
With two semesters work remaining
to be completed, Don returned here in
September to fulfill the requirements for
his Degree of Bachelor of Science in
Electrical Engineering.
Primarily a scholar, he has made an
excellent scholastic record for himself
despite his participation in several extra-
curricular activities. In recognition of
his achievements, he was elected to
membership in Tau Beta Pi in his Jun-
ior year.
Don spends his spare time in several
extra-curricular activities. Now that he
is a senior he feels that he can't let down
on his studies with the "finish line so
close at hand," and therefore has not
spent as much of his time as formerly on
campus activities. However, he was a
member of the Choral Union for two
years, and participated in the annual
performances of the ''Messiah" and the
May Festival. He also is a member of
the student branch of the American In-
stitute of Electrical Engineers.
One thing which is more or less un-
usual about Don is that during one
period he managed to get home forty
weekends in a row except for the two
times which he missed because of his
activities with the Choral Union. May-

Donald DeGraaf
be one would guess what attracted him
away from campus—as an oft seen ad-
vertisement states, "Never underesti-
mate the power of a woman." However,
with graduation so close at hand and
the pressure of his studies, Don has not
managed to get home as often recently.
After graduation, Don intends to go
back to Calvin College and home for
a semester or two and take several Arts
courses, such as Philosophy, History
and English. He says that he is tired
of working so hard and is looking for-
ward to taking it easy in Lit. school for
a while. After that he plans to come
back here for graduate work in Physics
or Engineering. He has not as yet de-
cided whether to be a teacher of Physics
or Engineering or an engineer. However,
at present he is leaning towards the
former as there is a teacher shortage.
Teaching appeals to him because of
what he calls the "University Atmos-
phere," the summer vacation of the
teacher, as well as the opportunity for
research and further studies. He also
believes that the engineering education
will give one a good practical back-
ground.

the firm's great test pilots. From the
post of flight engineer he moved to the
position of engineering test-pilot after
qualifying as a pilot.
Boeing's "Airworthiness Engineer" is
Milford F. Vanik, B.S.E. (Ae.E.) '30,
whose duties entail the responsibility of
seeing that the firm's design configura-
tions conform with Civil Aeronautics
Authority requirements in order that
today's huge airliners may qualify for
certification.
Paris-born David Mowrer, B.S.E.

Service Unit, having assisted during the
war in the development of the "flying
fortress" as a member of a body group.

His professional affiliations include:
the American Society for Metals, the
American Society of Tool Engineers, the
American Institute of Mining and
Metallurgical Engineers, and the Ameri-

The positions held by these men,
though they may vary widely from the
engineering student's conception of the
duties of an aeronautical engineer, are
typical. According to a Boeing com-
pany official, the design and develop-
ment of today's aircraft demand the
services of engineers in all categories.
For example, the development of the
"Strato-cruiser" was not the job of the
aerodynamicists but rather of the struc-
tural, civil, chemical, hydraulic, elec-
tronic, acoustic, and electrical engineers,
whose contributions comprised 90% of
the total man-hours expended.

Tau Beta Pi
This semester has been a busy one for
the members of Tau Beta Pi. The free
tutoring system conceived in the Spring
term was at last put into effect. Approx-
imately twenty members have devoted
an average of one and one-half hours a
week to tutoring sections representing a
number of courses in all departments.
During the war, the majority of Tau
Bates were Navy V-12 students. This
semester has seen a large increase in the
chapter's active role with the return of
many of the V-12 Engineers in addi-
tion to numbers of students who were
forced to leave school and enter the
armed forces before their graduation.
The fall initiation was held at the
Michigan Union on Tuesday, November
26, followed by a banquet at which Dr.
Ralph A. Sawyer of the Rackham
School of Graduate Studies was the main
speaker. Forty new undergraduate ac-
tives were admitted at this time in addi-
tion to two honorary members, Harry
H. Whittingham, 17E, a prominent civil
engineer of Detroit, and R. R. White
of the Chemical Engineering Depart-
ment. The 40 pledges are Kenneth Alli-
son, Frank Arams, John Artley, James
Decker, Melvin Folkert, Orville Gre-
unke, Richard Hamme, William Healy,
Tom Hendrickson, Edward Hotte, Ed-
ward Hutchinson, Robert Johnson,
Henry Kaminski, William Kiessel, Rich-
ard Lambert, Lawrence Lutzker, Robert
McVean, William Meechan, William
Meyer, Eugene Moody, Edward Moon,
Howard Morrison, F. Narcisco, Robert
Norris, William Pritula, Pierre Raynaud.
A. Resnick, Donald Sagaser, William
Sherwood, Eugene Sikorovsky, George
Snow, Robert Unangst, Roland Ure,
Bill Waterbury, Gilbert Westa, David
Whitcombe. Richard Widman, and Don-
ald Frey.
The requirements for membership are
as follows: to be considered, the Na-
tional Constitution requires that an En-
gineer be in the upper fifth of his class
if a senior or the upper eighth if a sec-
ond semester junior. Subordinate chap-

ters may raise these requirements as
they see fit, according to the conditions
in their own colleges. Such things as
personal integrity, and general activity
in extra curricular activities are consid-
ered along with scholastic standing.
High grades are not sufficient grounds
in themselves for election to member-
ship.
A. I. Ch. E.
The Chem engineers held a regular
meeting on November 26, presenting
William Yates of the patent department
of Dow Chemical Co. who spoke about
the enigmatic patent and its connection
with the engineer. In addition to their
other meetings there have been five field
trips. The first, which was a full day's
trip to Dow Chemical Co. in Midland,
presented a tour of the plant—strange
devices, heretofore quite theoretical,
were observed. Condensers, evapora-
tors, and dryers plus a number of or-
ganic liquids and their manufacturing
processes were explained by Dow's en-
gineers.
The first fall plant trip of the
A.I.Ch.E., to the Pennsylvania Salt
Company and Sharpies Chemicals Cor-
poration took place November 8. Both
companies showed considerable enthusi-
asm in conducting tours through the
plants. At Pennsylvania Salt, the proc-
esses of chlorine production and lique-
faction, caustic concentration and flak-
ing, and manufacture of synthetic am-
monia were observed. At Sharpies
Chemicals Corporation, the complete
line of chemicals manufactured from
chlorinated pentane were exhibited;
these processes included chlorination of
pentane, hydrolysis of chloropentane to
amyl alcohol; production of amyl ace-
tate and manufacture of ethyl amine.
Many specialty products synthesized in
smaller amounts were observed. As a
finishing touch to a very pleasant trip
members of the A.I.Ch.E. were guests
of the Pennsylvania Salt Company at a
lunch after the tour.
Other field trips were: the Graselli
Sulfuric Acid Plant, the Socony-Vacuum
Oil Co. at Trenton, Michigan, and one
to the Ford River Rouge plant. Most
popular, however, was the trip to the
Goebel Brewing Co. in Detroit; samples
of the product were distributed. All
trips were run in several sections except
the Ford trip.
I. Ae. S.
On October IS, 1932, the Institute of
Aeronautical Science was incorporated
and its charter drawn up. Since then,
aircraft, as we all know, and the I.Ae.S.
have both risen to new and greater
heights as succeeding years have passed.
Even during the last war, the I.Ae.S.
continued as an active body due to the
large number of men in the Armed
Forces taking Aeronautical Engineering
under their respective branches. With
the veterans returned en masse, the
campus membership has risen to 110.
As the result of the annual fall elec-
tion, the following officers were selected:
Maurice P. Murphy, chairman; Karl
Stevens, co-chairman; Harry Apoich,
treasurer; and William D. Milner, cor-
responding secretary. Professor J. D.
Schetzer was chosen as faculty adviser
for the Institute.
A series of three lectures on super-
sonic design and propulsion have been
given. Dr. D. T. Williams told about
the advancement in propulsion and the
problems encountered. Upper atmos-
pheric research by guided missiles was
discussed by Dr. M. A. Nichols, who
illustrated his talk with two captured
German films, one on the V-2's develop-
ment and flight and the other on the
German rocket plane, the M.E. 163.
Completing the series, Professor W. C.
Nelson acquainted the group with sev-
eral supersonic design problems. At the
close of this meeting, a group picture
was taken.
The most important event of the
semester was an over-night trip to
Cleveland during the National Aircraft
Show. First on the list of activities was
a tour through the National Advisory
Committee for Aeronautics buildings,
where research on various types of jet
motors is being conducted. Officials at
N.A.C.A. were successful in making the
trip interesting. An engineer was posted
in each department to describe the type
of research being carried out.
On Saturday, an air show entitled "A
World's Fair for Aircraft," was given.
Historical displays of every type of air-
craft, guided missiles, and ultra-modern
engines covered the area in profusion.

electronic heating
The gluing of large sections of wood
in a minimum of time, suitable to mass
production, has been solved by the use
of electronics. Electronic heating, some-
times called radio-frequency heating,
diathermic heating, dielectric heating,
or high-frequency heating, is the use of
high-frequency alternating current for
uniform, rapid heating.
The wood to be heated is placed be-
tween two electrodes to which the high-
frequency alternating voltage is applied.
The rapidity at which the polarity of
the plates changes sets up electrical
stresses in the wood. At one instant,
the molecules are urged in one direction;
at the next, in the opposite direction.
For an applied frequency of 30 mega-
cycles, this is repeated thirty million
times a second, and the friction between
the molecules results in heating of the
material. The heat produced is uni-
formly distributed throughout the wood.
The material being heated may be
moved on a conveyor between the elec-
trodes, providing the space between the
electrodes and the wood is not too great.
The thinner the wood, the less the volt-
age that can be applied because of the
possibility of arcing which would scorch
the wood. With the lower voltage, the
frequency must be higher to produce
the same amount of heat.
In the furniture industry, curved-
laminated sections, such as used for
radio cabinets and pianos, can be assem-
bled with electronic heat and made
lighter, stronger and cheaper than when
the present methods, as slotting, steam-
ing, bending and reinforcing with a
solid piece of wood, are used. At the
present time, the industry has used elec-
tronic heating only for making core
lumber, the name given to the multiple
pieces of solid wood placed between two
pieces of veneer to make large flat sur-
faces as desk tops. Additional applica-
tions have not been made, because pro-
duction volume has not warranted the
justification of the expense of setting
up electrode fixtures and jigs for specific
operations. When using the method of
electronic heating, the material must be
subjected to heating for only a few
seconds, as compared to present methods
which require slotting, bending and
overnight clamping in a jig.
Resin-impregnated and compressed
wood, known as Compreg, and resin-
impregnated wood, known as Impreg,
are two products produced by the elec-
tronic heating method. The strength

per unit weight has been reported in
excess of that of steel. One of the war
applications of the material was in the
production of aircraft propeller blades.
By using different lengths of wood, the
density was gradually decreased from
the hub to the tip of the blade, which
reduced the strain on the propeller shaft.
By varying the densities to meet load
requirements, it is possible to manufac-
ture beams to specific conditions.
The most wide spread use of elec-
tronic heating is in the plywood indus-
try. Through this method of heating,
heavy sections may be made. As an
example, 148 sheets of impregnated
birch veneer have been glued success-
fully, using a phenolic resin adhesive.
With the increasing scarcity of large
cross sections of timber and the in-
herent lack of uniformity of lumber,
plywood manufacturing is assuming a
tremendous importance. Plywood, man-
ufactured with the electronic method,
has been used in the manufacture of
aircraft wing spars, PT boat girders and
ribs, boat keels and other comparatively
large items. Electronic methods heat
wood products and glues so fast that
their use has reduced process time from
hours to minutes. Production rates are
increased and costs reduced, rejects are
fewer, wear and breakage on molds and
presses is lower. With these advantages,
in the next few years we should expect
to see enormous production in the man-
ufacture of more and more complicated
wood products at a price to fit every-
one's pocket.
alloys beat the heat
The war-time application of high-
temperature alloys to turbosupercharger,
gas turbine and jet engine construction
is an outstanding metallurgical achieve-
ment of the war. The alloys are used
for high temperature work where large
stresses are encountered. Research on
this work was given impetus during the
war and is still continuing.
The super-alloy project was one of
the many cooperative developments of
the war, which depended upon the col-
laboration of dozens of manufacturers,
metallurgists, and engineers. The War
Metallurgy Committee and the Super-
Alloys Project of the War Production
Board were active nerve centers in this
development. Engines were made by
Westinghouse, General Electric and
others. The special alloys were devel-
oped or made by several manufacturers:
General Electric, Westinghouse, Allis-
Chalmers, Haynes Stellite Company,
Timken Bearing Company, and stainless
steel companies, all who participated in
the development and manufacture of
parts.
The demand was for high speed ma-
terials—either metallic or non-metallic
—that would stand continuous tempera-
tures between 1200° F and 1500° F.
The problem was to find metals that

He borrowed to create a business
Benjamin Franklin believed in hard work.
He started his printing business on a shoe-
string, with borrowed money. His credit
and reputation were good because he was
thrifty and industrious. He delivered his
printing to customers in a wheelbarrow;
worked far into the night frequently.
From literally nothing he developed a re-
spected business.
American business and industry have
been built only by hard work and good
management. The contributions that man-
agement has made to the nation are clear:
it has created great industries, millions of
jobs; it has safeguarded the foundations

of our business structure by planning and
conducting business soundly. We shall
continue to progress only if an honest
day's work continues to lie recognized as
both desirable and necessary.
Today, the printing industry u mechanized. In
thousands of printing machines, SCSFF3 bear-
ings — both ball and roller — have conquered
friction, and helped make modern printing
machinery possible. Science-minded Franklin
would have appreciated SlDStp3 bearings . .,
they're built to do specific jobs and do them
right. In printing, as in other industries, they

"Are you on?" asked the one mashed
against the icy metal wall of a Willow
Run 'Leaping Lena.'
"Half way," answered the unfortu-
nate 'inside man', and he was making a
conservative estimate. Long before the
frontier steppes of 'the Run' are crossed,
the arm-bracing substitution of a turn-
ing moment for a more commonly ap-
plied lifting force will cause this man
to regret his mild acceptance of one
point support and give voice to muttered
complaint.
A Darwin adaptation of Paul Bun-
van's tales of the Sidehill Wompus
(sometimes called a Contour Beagle)
may someday lead to the evolution of
genus homo willowrunbusus. As you
may remember, the legs of a queer
species of animal, whose habitat was ex-
clusively the sides of steep hills, grew
shorter on one side than on the other to
permit a more or less upright existence,
provided, of course, that the shorter legs
remained on the uphill side. Infant Side-
hill Wompae, after their fourth or fifth
roll down the hill learned to obey the
unvarying rule of "short legs uphill."
All this might possibly apply in
similar manner to University of Mich-
igan students residing in West Lodge.
We will have our right-bus-sitters and
our left-bus-sitters, depending, natural-
ly, on which side of the bus the person
usually rides. No doubt we will then
have acquired what might humorously
be termed a 'new slant on life,' but to
those who must forever walk in an in-
clined position there will be little to
laugh at.
Extrapolation of a biological evolution
curve based upon data gathered in a
recent AVC survey reveals the follow-
ing picture for the possible near future,
as might be told by a Willow Runner of
that day.
* * *
In this, the year of our Lord 1947,
there are five lines of students waiting
for the five o'clock bus to Williow Run,
extending at most no further back than
East Hall. Although shorter lines have
created certain advantages noticeable
over a long period of time, no longer on
wintry days can we pick up a cup of
hot coffee at Wikel's while standing in
the slow moving line.
Ahead of me, I see the columns
huddled together, just as the people will
sit on the bus. The three lines on the
left are designated in order from left to
right as alpha, beta, and gamma left-
side-sitters.
Both alpha and beta left-side-sitters
are very narrow and appear to have
suffered severe lateral flattening due to
excessive compression stresses. The pri-
mary difference in the two types seems
to be the thick layer of fur which has

developed on the left side of alpha. This
serves a double purpose—as insulation
against cold winds while he stands in
the outside line, and as a pad to pre-
vent freezing of the left side of his body
while in contact with the frigid steel
wall of the bus. The coat of fur which
has grown on the bodies of the rest of
genus homo willowrunbusus is simply
for protection against cold and exposure
in the unheated busses and is ordinarily
shed during the summer months.
Gamma left-side-sitters have an un-
natural posterior droop to the right,
which actually enables them, with the
aid of an overly developed right arm,
to sit half on the edge of a bus seat
and half on the floor of the bus. The
remaining two lines are called alpha and
beta right-side-sitters, designated from
right to left, and are mirror images of
alpha and gamma left-side-sitters, re-
spectively.
Near the head of the lines stands a
small group of students who bear similar
resemblances to other members of genus
homo willowrunbusus, with the excep-
tion that these people have either one
or both legs very much foreshortened.
They are known as alpha and beta right
and left wheel-sitters. The alpha variety
has two equally short legs, while the
beta type has only one short leg, cor-
responding to his assigned wheel. The
gamma left-wheel-sitter is non-existent
and is customarily replaced with a nor-
mal gamma left-side-sitter.
I see we have a new starter on duty
this afternoon—but we are expecting a
replacement soon. The old one had been
on duty nearly two days over his al-
lotted time and was beginning to get
that queer laugh which is the first sign
of the forthcoming breakdown. Univer-
sity Hospital mental staff members have
their hands full with the rehabilitation
program for psycho bus starters. The
problem of loading such a peculiar
group of students has been too much
for most normal men assigned to the
job, and I don't believe a completely
sane man has been hired since the Uni-
versity first took over Willow Run.
The complexity of many problems
also takes a heavy toll of classifiers dur-
ing registration week, as only certain
classes and classrooms are furnished to
handle such queer people and schedules
must be arranged accordingly. Also, the
ratio of alpha, beta, and gamma side-
and-wheel-sitters finishing their day in
Ann Arbor at any one time must always
be held in bus proportion, to eliminate
an excess or a deficiency of a particular
species. Although the information is
closely guarded, it is rumored that
nearly thirty classifiers committed sui-
cide last semester alone.
I am almost up to the bus now—but
the starter has run out of alpha left-
wheel-sitters. The confused look on his
face is enough to tell any of us that
he isn't going to last very long at this
job. As has always been the case, busses
can't leave unless they are jammed full
—and apparently this is to be no excep-
tion. It will probably be a long, cold
wait before another wheel-sitter turns
up, and even then he may not be an
alpha left-wheeler.
So ends the description of what the
future holds for the permanent resident
students of Willow Run. Perhaps some-
thing may be done to correct the situa-
tion before matters have gone too far
in the way of this undesirable evolution.
Immediate action is essential, however,
for already a number of male bus riders
find it necessary to shave one side of
their face more than once a day in order
to look presentable. The trouser situa-
tion is also becoming difficult, as many
clothing stores object to the weird al-
terations required in exceptional cases.

Horizons of Chemistry
constantly beckon . . •
Dow is deeply interested in colleges and technical schools and maintains
close lies with them. The very nature of our business makes this a logical
course for us to pursue.
We are producers of chemicals essential to industry and agriculture. We
are developers of plastic materials. We are the pioneer producers of mag-
nesium, recovering this lightest of all structural metals from ocean water.
We arc developers of magnesium alloys and methods for their fabrication.
To carry on this work, research is a necessity and a considerable portion
of our efforts and resources are devoted to it as an undeviating policy.
All these activities require trained men—scientists and technicians—
chemists and chemical engineers—metallurgists, biologists, physicists,
entomologists. Dow employs such men in large numlwrs—keeps an eye on
them as they emerge from their academic training—gives many of them
special schooling at the Dow plants, according to the jobs they are slated
to do.
In peace as well as in war, chemistry is an essential occupation because it
deals with materials essential to industry and to the health of (he nation.
It is a developing business with horizons that constantly beckon — a
profession to intrigue any ambitious young man with an eye to the future.

"Which cell is McHigan's?" I asked
the attendant.
"Number 29," said the man in the
white coat, "Just go down to the sub-
basement at the head of the elevator
shaft, knock at the 3rd Quonset hut
and give the password, 'f equals ma.'
Is that clear? Good!"
Minutes later, I spied McHigan in
cell 29. McHigan gave a roar that
shattered my eye glasses and pierced
my eardrums. With a look of deep con-
centration, he said to himself, "Ek
equals ^mv*." Lowering his head, he
raced across the cell. There was a loud
crash. McHigan arose, shook his head,
and muttered with a smirk, "They said
I couldn't prove it, but it's all very
obvious as I have just demonstrated."
His expression changed—his face
softened and grew nostalgic. "Ah," he
mused, "Well do I remember my fresh-
man days as an engineer in old Prof.
Monotone Superbore's class. Some-
times, while studying one of 1,000 for-

mulas and equations, moments of com-
prehension would steal upon me. Once,
while deep in thought, as the crimson
sun sank softly into the purple eve and
all was still and calm and peaceful, the
awful realization of the law of sines
burst upon me like a tidal wave smash-
ing against the Cliffs of Dover. And
once — memorable day — after eating
five tubes of No-Nod. I stayed awake
through one complete lecture. Mono-
tone's bluebooks were not bad,"—here
McHigan sank to the floor and turned
a translucent, quivering grey-green, his
voice dropped to a whisper—; Because
we had only to calculate the answers to
17 significant figures."
McHigan turned vacant eyes on me.
Suddenly a violent convulsion seized
him—his eyes rolled, he panted, he
kicked. Seizing the inch-thick steel bars
of his cell, and exerting a maniacal force
of 90,000 ft.-lbs., he tied an overhand
knot in them. I shrank back in horror.
McHigan noticed me—he calmed down
and said, "M equals f x L," and at-
tempted to beat his chest—narrowly
missing it.
Then he stretched, scratched his head,
and went on: "I was lucky, though. I
was a sophomore before my vision drop-
ped to 4.68293/20.00000. Similarly, my
hair stayed with me until I got caught
in the rain and the glue melted."
McHigan's eyes glowed warmly and
his face beamed as he slouched to a more
comfortable slouch. "Once," he sighed
wistfully. "Once I had a woman in my
class. She wore dresses, so I knew she
was a woman. You know what a woman
is?" he asked me anxiously. I nodded
doubtfully. "One day when I came to
class, she smiled at me—that was the
day my leg got caught in the machine
for testing the tensile strength of steel
bars. My leg has a tensile strength of
4 psi," he added, "above the knee."
And now he was silent—his eye lids
dropped and he lapsed into troubled
sleep. I did not have the heart to
awaken him! His arms twitched in his
formula-covered cuffs, his hair twirled
in logarithmic spirals, and his arms
moved restlessly back and forth. His
mouth opened and he moaned, "More
morphine, nurse—more! more! Put out
the fire; put it out! PUT IT OUT!!
"What fire?" I asked.
"The Fire! " he snorted; "It was dur-
ing the war. Fall had come and the
nights grew cold. The leaves fell. Frost
appeared. And all this time, I searched,
begged, pleaded, and tried to steal some
alcohol. No—not to drink. It was for
my slide rule. But, I could not get it."
"Slide rule—alcohol?" I muttered.
"I had one of K and E's super special,
double slide, log log log. duplex, decitrig.
addition, water cooled slide rules. It
was beautiful. It had a radiator of
nickel steel tubing. But. I couldn't find
the alcohol. One night in November,
the temperature fell to minus 20° and
my slide rule froze tight—tight as a
drum of ethanol. Hoping that I would
not have to use it next day, I went to
class. In my 8 o'clock class, we had a
surprise bluebook; we calculated, my
slide rule grew hot, my fingers became
blistered, but the radiator would not
thaw. At my nine o'clock class, I was in
clouds of nauseating smoke, and the
pressure gauge approached the red mark
as we calculated the sine tables at one
second intervals.
"I was asphyxiated, but I staggered
gamely to my 10 o'clock class. My
slide rule had thawed out, but it was
too late. The steam was past the critical
point; the piping glowed a dull red; it
sizzled and spat. I could barely read the
charred figures as I worked a short 4-
page thermo problem. Suddenly, there
was a terrific explosion; bits of burning
wood and metal filled the air. Super-
heated steam rose in dense clouds."
"This disturbance must cease', shouted
the instructor, digging a small piece of
molten metal out of his left ear. 'Please
take your seats.' Four hours later. I
was helped out of a pile of smoldering
coals."

"You are aware, said the Dean, that
explosions are punishable by fine or im-
prisonment when unauthorized?"
"But Dean, I managed to stutter, it
was all caused by the alcohol—."
"Ah ha! Drinking means expulsion,
you know."
"No, no, Dean, it was just, at first, a
little smoke—."
"Smoking in the classroom. How fla-
grant."
"Oh. I groaned, I wish I was home
with my mother."
"So there was a woman in it, said
the Dean."
McHigan's face was a picture of
misery, dispair. of hopeless and utter
aloneness. His head sagged, his mouth
turned down at the corners, the lines of
his face were deep and haggard. He
stirred. He arose. His face changed.
Walking to the side of his cell he
screamed piercingly, then smirked and
said. "Ek equals ^mv2." Lowering his
head, he—.
I could stand no more. I ran.

Movie film earners are an
excellent example of using
plastics where plastics belong.
The film carrier illustrated is
only one of many types made
from Synthane laminated plas-

the job because it stoutly resists
the corrosive action of develop-

find from the records, no one ever com-
pleted the six-year course. If a student
could devote more than four years to
his college course, he usually preferred
to take one additional year and earn his
master's degree, or even to go still fur-
ther and take a doctor's degree. In some
schools required six-year courses were
established, but almost always the num-
ber of students decreased so greatly that
the six-year requirement was soon
dropped.
Having in mind the tremendous in-
crease in technical knowledge in the last
SO years, you may be wondering what
the student of SO years ago found to
study. Sometimes I wonder myself.
Here are the requirements for a degree
in Electrical Engineering in 1896-97. I
confine myself to electrical engineering
since I have more personal knowledge
of it. The requirements in civil and me-
chanical engineering were similar. These
were the only courses offered at that
time; now there are at least 18.
General Requirements
French and German IS hrs.
English 2 hrs.
Mathematics 22 hrs.
Physics 5 hrs.
Chemistry 3 hrs.
Drawing S hrs.
Civil Engineering 2 hrs.
TOTAL 54 hrs.
Special Requirements in Electrical
Engineering
Physics 9 hrs.
Drawing 3 hrs.
Shop Practice 10 hrs.
Mechanical Engineering .. 9 hrs.
Electrical Engineering .... 16 hrs.
Elective Studies 19 hrs.
TOTAL 66 hrs.
The total requirement was 120 hours
plus a thesis, equivalent to about 10
hours.
Lack of space and time has forced
the dropping of the thesis and has in-
creased the total hours to 140. Every-
thing in the world changes and engineer-
ing education is no exception. Some of
the reasons for the changes should be
interesting to present-day students.
The greatest change is in the foreign
language requirement, which has been
entirely eliminated although the stu-
dent may of course take elective work
in language if he so desires. (Very few
do). For many years, there was a pro-
found difference of opinion regarding
(Continued from page 5)
this requirement. The late Dean Cooley
was the principal advocate of keeping
the requirement, and his influence was
such that French and German were re-
tained long after most of us had been
convinced that the time might be better
used in other ways. Dean Cooley
was strongly in favor of Spanish as a
substitute on account of its practical
value in South America. No one, as far
as I remember, advocated Portugese
although more people in South America
use this language rather than Spanish.
The principal argument in favor of
language study was that the engineer
needed a knowledge of French and Ger-
man to keep abreast of developments
abroad. At that time, Germany led in
advanced research in physics and en-
gineering with France a good second.
In this country a little research was car-
ried on mostly by college professors just
because they were curious to find out
what made the wheels go round. They,
of course, received no pay and little
glory. A few men like Bell and Edison
made large fortunes from their inven-
tions, but they were few. Organized re-
search as carried on today by the large
corporations was unknown.
For this reason, a knowledge of
French and German was valuable to a
few research men; however the bald
fact is that not over one percent mas-
tered enough French or German so that
they were of any practical value. A
check of the books in the library shows
that most of the foreign language books
have not been taken out for many years.
As a practical matter, it is a fact that
more scientific material is now pub-
lished in Russian than in any language
except English. No one denies that the
study of languages has great cultural
value, but the consensus of opinion
seems to be that the limited time avail-
able might better be spent on such sub-
jects as English, economics, political
science, etc.
The requirement in English has taken
an astonishing jump from two to ten
hours. A two hour course, called "Para-
graph Writing" was for many years all
that was required. It is difficult to ex-
plain why English was not considered
more important in the early days. Some
think that students used to come to us
better prepared in English. In addition,
there is a growing recognition of the
fact that English is one of the funda-
mental tools of the engineer. An idea
to be of much value must be imparted
to others, and not infrequently to a
number of people at once. This means
the use of English or the preparation of
a drawing. Rarely, ideas are conveyed
by mathematics. The ability to write
a good report or to present an idea
verbally to a group in a way that is
clear and convincing is of the utmost
value to the engineer. Of course, to
have the idea in the first place is essen-
tial but to be able to make others under-
stand and accept the idea is hardly less
important. In spite of the increased time
given to English, the results are very
disappointing. Part of the blame lies in
the home; perhaps, part in the methods
of instruction, but that is too large a
subject to discuss here. It should also
be noted that what is labeled "English"
in the announcement involves a good
deal of discussion of philosophy, religion
and related subjects, so that the time
actually given to English is less than
appears at first sight.
In mathematics there is an apparent
reduction from 22 to 18 hours, but ac-
tually there has been but little change
since four of the 22 hours were devoted
to theoretical mechanics, now taught as
engineering mechanics—physics and
chemistry remain much the same and
this is also true of drawing.
In the early days, shop work, really
manual training, was an important part
of the curriculum. We were required to
take four courses; pattern making, forg-
ing, foundry and machine shop; a total
of 10 credit hours. These courses were
listed under mechanical engineering.
The purpose was primarily to show the
student how things were done, and
secondarily, how to do them. In the
early days, manufacturing processes
were simple and hand work predomi-
nated. (The word manufacture, of
course, means to make by hand). As
time went by, it became more and more
difficult to provide machines to illustrate
manufacturing processes. Obviously, we
could not show a rolling mill or an auto-
mobile assembly line in operation. In-
spection trips were and still are used,
supplemented by moving pictures and in
this way, the student gets at least an
inkling of modern manufacturing proc-
esses. The need for more time for the
more technical studies has reduced the
shop work (for electrical engineers) to a
two-hour course in working, welding,
and treating of steel.
Personally, I enjoyed shop work very

What kind of engineer does the
Telephone Business need?
Many kinds, for many kinds of work . . .
research and development, technical and
economic planning, operations which in-
volve the manufacturing, construction and
maintenance of telephone facilities.
Telephone engineering is broad in scope
but includes intensive study of a wide
variety of specific problems. Much of it
requires the special knowledge of electrical,
mechanical, industrial or other engineers.
All of it requires the engineer's background,
his understanding of scientific principles,
his trait of weighing the facts and deriving
logical and workable conclusions.
With our greatest expansion program
in history under way the work of the
telephone engineer is more important than
ever. In the next few years $2,000,000,000
will be spent for new buildings, new equip-
ment and plant facilities.
The engineering task involved in this
program, as well as in the normal operation
of the industry, means just one thing:
qualified engineers who choose telephony
as a career will find their lives packed with
interesting and satisfying work.

much and regretted that it was neces-
sary to drop it from the curriculum. The
four instructors (they were actually
listed as special assistants in the engi-
neering laboratory) were all practical
men, selected presumably because they
were interested in young men. Each of
them was a ''character" and they are
still fresh in the memory of all of us
who worked under them. Horace Pur-
field, who died only a couple of years
ago, lived to be over a hundred years
of age and was probably the oldest
living engineering teacher. He was very
religious and set us a good example.
Thomas Orr, who taught forging loved
to "button-hole" a freshman who hap-
pened to have an iron heating in the
fire and engage him in earnest conver-
sation. Presently, the iron would begin
to burn and throw off a shower of
sparks. This was the signal to "bawl
out" the poor freshman in language
more forceful than refined. 'But Mr.
Orr, you were talking to me," the poor
fellow would plead. "Makes no differ-
ence. Your job was to heat that iron,
not listen to idle talk." The lesson stuck
longer than many we learned out of
books. Bob Winslow (foundry) loved
to spin yarns by the hour and many a
session he and Cooley (later, Dean
Cooley) used to have. John Smoots
(machine shop) was of the precise, for-
mal type. They all hoped to educate us;
peace to their ashes.
In Mechanical Engineering, 17 hours
were required, but this figure is very
misleading. The four courses in shop
work, totalling ten hours, were included
as well as a course in mechanism, three
hours, and one in dynamics of machin-
ery, two hours, both now given under
engineering mechanics. The only course
we would now list under mechanical en-
gineering was one in prime movers, two
hours. We have now expanded this
requirement to seven or eight hours and
could use a lot more to advantage.
Engineering mechanics has been
kicked around like a football. Of course,
some of the elements have always been
taught as part of physics, but in the
early days, mathematics assumed much
of the burden. Later, all this work was
consolidated under civil engineering. In
1895, theoretical mechanics was a part
of mathematics, but graphical analysis
of structures, strength and resistance of
materials and hydraulics were under
civil engineering. All the "old timers"
(Continued from page 22)
remember "S. and R." as taught first
by Dean Greene and later by Gardiner
Williams. It was for many years our
"Pons Asinorum" and served to sepa-
rate the sheep from the goats. Under
Gardiner Williams, (then Head of Civil
Engineering) the examinations lasted
two or three days and seriously inter-
fered with our other work. Perhaps,
largely to correct this condition, engi-
neering mechanics was finally made a
separate department.
There has been constant pressure
throughout the years to increase the
nontechnical content of the engineering
curriculum. Strangely enough, much if
not most of this pressure has come from
employers. Their constant complaint
has been that the young engineer is poor
in English and that in general he lacks
the broad education that is expected of
the professional man. As I have already
pointed out. the English requirement
has been greatly increased and eco-
nomics has been made a required sub-
ject. In addition, every student is re-
quired to elect six hours of nontechnical
electives. In all. he has to take 22 hours
of work which to many students seems
more or less a waste of time. In most
cases after 20 years of actual engi-
neering work, he will have a quite dif-
ferent opinion. He will probably have
little occasion to use advanced mathe-
matics, but if he can write a good report
and can talk plainly and convincingly
to a small or large group, he will have
an invaluable asset.
In 1895, electrical engineering was
in its infancy. There were few books
and these were mostly of a simple de-
scriptive character. Since then, our
knowledge has both broadened and
deepened, and no man can hope to mas-
ter more than a small fraction of it.
Here is a brief outline of what we had
to study.
Electro-Dynamic Machinery. Four
hours including some laboratory work.
The course was largely descriptive.
What was involved was very simple.
Professor Carhart (who started the work
in electrical engineering) taught the
class. He was a good lecturer but by no
means popular with the students. His
pet aversion was blown fuses and each
case called for a thorough investigation
and the poor culprit did not hear the
last of it for many a long day. The
students did not get much opportunity
to handle the electrical equipment. In
the laboratory classes, we lined up out-
side the locked door and waited.
Promptly at one o'clock, the doors were
opened and we filed in, being careful to
touch nothing. Everything had been
connected up in advance and we were
each assigned to read an instrument.
When we were "all set" Carhart closed
the switches and the experiment started.
Our equipment was very crude and
limited and was located in the East end
of the West Physics Building. The total
floor space was only a small fraction of
what we have now. Much of our work
was taking curves on an old Edison bi-
polar generator and a Sperry arc gener-
ator. We still have these machines and
others in our historical collection. At
first, all this machinery was driven from
a countershaft which was in turn driv n
by a steam engine. When the Univer-
sity built its own power house in 1897.
the steam engine was removed and a 43
hp, 220 volt direct current motor was
installed. Our source of alternating cur-
rent was a single-phase, 120 cycle Fort
Wayne alternator. Just before 1 gradu-
ated, a small polyphase alternator was
added. This was built by two students
as a thesis and is still in use.
The work in direct current machinery
was very simple; little mathematics be-
yond arithmetic was required. The
course in alternating currents was
naturally more theoretical but the mate-
rial available for study was very meagre.
After some introductory theory, we went
at once to the transformer and the alter-
nator. It had been known for some time
that an alternator would run as a syn-
chronous motor but it had to be brought
up to speed by an auxiliary motor.
Naturally, not much was known about
the theory. Tesla had by this time in-
vented the induction motor, but the
theory was not known to any extent and
no machines were available for experi-
mental work; in fact, I never saw an
induction motor until my graduation.
I, of course, had no idea that much of
my life would be spent designing induc-
tion motors. The first time I ever saw
one was when I joined the General Elec-
tric Company about a year later. The
courses in distribution and photometry
(now illumination) were very elemen-
tary. The arc light was fairly well de-
veloped and quite efficient, but was
available only in large units (200 candle
power). Moreover, since the voltage
was high (up to 5000 volts per circuit).

they were dangerous to life and property
and were little used except for outdoor
illumination. Incandescent lamps were
of the carbon filament type, frequently
described as a red hot hairpin in a
bottle. The standard size was 16 candle
power and they required at least three
times as much energy as do modern
tungsten filament lamps. As a matter
of fact, light now costs less than one
tenth as much as it did then since elec-
trical energy is also much cheaper. Of
course, as a consequence, we use much
more light and an old 16 c.p. lamp
would seem like a very feeble glimmer
now.
Instead of the sixteen hours in Elec-
trical Engineering required in 1896, the
present-day student is required to take
41 hours if he chooses the Machinery-
Power Group, or 44 hours if he takes
the Electronics-Communication Option.
In either case, he still has 6 or 7 elec-
tive hours which are frequently used to
take more electrical engineering courses.
Among the entirely new required
courses we have Principles of Electricity
and Magnetism, Electromechanics, Pow-
er Plants, Electronics, Advanced Theory
of Electrical Circuits, Radio, Advanced
(Continued from page 24)
Radio, Telephones, Industrial Elec-
tronics, and Economic Applications.
In addition to the required courses,
we list 69 hours of elective work besides
research courses. Most of these courses
are highly technical and are intended
primarily for graduate students, but
many are elected by undergraduates. In
all, the Electrical Engineering Depart-
ment offers, in addition to research
courses, 131 credit hours of work. It
would require four years of hard work
to take all these courses, and of course
no student has ever taken even most of
them. It is almost equally obvious that
no man on the faculty is capable of
teaching all of them. The days when
one man could master all of electrical
engineering are gone forever, and the
same things is true of other branches of
engineering.
The moral of all this is that the time
is rapidly approaching when we must
change radically our ideas of engineer-
ing education. We are trying to cram
too much into the traditional four years
with the result that many men graduate
with only a smattering of the work they
have studied. For the good student, 5,
6, or 7 years is not too much time to
spend in college. For the average stu-
dent, four years is probably enough. He
should, however, cover less ground but
cover it better. For others of a more
practical type, two years spent in ac-
quiring a good knowlege of drawing,
trigonometry, and similar subjects may
be sufficient. Such a man is not neces-
sarily inferior to the one who delights in
the study of more advanced subjects. It
is not at all probable that Thomas Edi-
son and Henry Ford would have been
more successful if they had spent years
studying higher mathematics. In indus-
try, there is a place for every type of
mind. In developing a new product, we
need the inventor, the research man, the
designer, the man who must direct the
manufacture, and finally the man who
must sell the product. No one of these
is more important than the others since
each is essential. However, the educa-
tion best suited to the man going into
research is quite different from that
most likely to turn out a good manufac-
turing man. What we need now is more
opportunity for the man who needs a
good trade school education as well as
better chances for the occasional man
who can profit by more advanced study.

PROBLEM — You are designing a diathermy unit. Included in the
electrical circuit are variable elements which must be adjusted
during operation. The control knobs must be located where they
will be convenient to the operator. The variable elements them-
selves must be located in the cabinet where they will be easy
to mount, to wire and to service. How would you do it?
THE SIMPLE ANSWER
Use an S.S.White remote control type
flexible shaft to couple each variable
element to its control knob. This simple
arrangement makes it possible to
place the elements and their controls
anywhere you want them. And you
will find, too, that operation with these
shafts is as smooth and sensitive as a
direct connection, because S.S.White
remote control flexible shafts are de-
signed and built especially for this
type of duty.
• *
This is just one of hundreds of remote
control and power drive problems to
which S.S.White flexible shafts pro-
vide a simple answer. That's why
every engineer should be familiar with
the range and scope of these "Metal
Muscles"* for mechanical bodies.

Here's how one well known elec-
tronic equipment manufacturer
did it. The flexible shaft (arrow)
connects control knob at top to
a variable element at the bot-
tom rear.

before. There are, admittedly, many
difficulties to be overcome, and not the
least of these is the earth's gravitation.
Speeds of 7 miles per second must be
attained, but not at prohibitive rates of
acceleration. Thus Jules Verne's moon
gun would be out of the question, for
the high initial acceleration would kill
all passengers. The suggested solution
to this problem is a multiple step
rocket, with an enormous booster rocket
carrying the actual space ship picka-
back until its fuel is exhausted, when it
could be dropped and exploded to mini-
mize the dangers of its fall back to
earth. The space ship could then go on
to its destination, unburdened by the
great weight of an empty fuel tank.
Meteors have been suggested as a
major difficulty but there are probably
not enough of them to make the dan-
ger of collision any greater than it
already is on the highways of America.
It is not known at present whether
a space ship must be cooled or heated
during its trip. Although the prevailing
temperature would be close to absolute
zero, the rocket would be exposed to the
sun's radiation without any protecting
layers of atmosphere to shield it, and
cooling systems may be necessary. The
simplest answer seems to be spinning
the ship like an artillery shell, so that
every part of the surface will be exposed
alternately to the heat of the sun, and
the cold of space. This spinning would
also produce centrifugal force which
would hold the passengers to the deck
just as gravity does, for the effect of
gravity will be negligible when the rocket
is thousands of miles from the earth.
While the trip around the moon will
probably be the first space voyage, in-
terplanetary explorers will concentrate
on Mars and Venus, for these planets
are more like the earth than any others.
Their temperatures and atmospheres are
also most similar to the earth's, and if
there are living creatures on any of the
planets, we may expect to find them on
these two.
Before he had learned to fly, man
dreamed of traveling into outer space,
but such trips were always forecast for
the distant future. Today, when we see
the swooping P-80, and read of the
amazing rocket developments of the past
five years, we find it hard to believe
that we must wait for Buck Rogers and
the 25 th century to see interplanetary
travel.

could be made into precision parts and
be used for high temperature work with-
out oxidizing or changing their precise
dimensions.
Two types of materials emerged from
the research for ultra-high-temperature
service, nickel-chromium steel to which
molybdenum, titanium and tungsten are
added separately or in combination, and
cobalt, or nickel, base alloys containing
alloying elements, chromium, tungsten
or molybdenum. These two alloys did
not solve simultaneously the problem of
load-bearing strength and dimensional
stability, but by employing them for
specific conditions best suited for each
alloy, their weaknesses were minimized.
With the development of high-tem-
perature alloys, fabrication problems
were encountered, the two most import-
ant being the making of the precision
parts and the final assembly. These
alloys, in addition to being resistant to
heat and stresses, are virtually impos-
sible to machine and forge. This bottle-
neck was solved by precision casting
methods which permit intricate parts to
be produced directly to close tolerances
without any machining. The problem of
final assembly was solved by welding
parts together, but conventional welding
materials and technique could not be
used. Ordinary welding electrodes would
not work with many alloys and required
the development of new welding rods
that would have the necessary high tem-
perature strength together with satisfac-
tory working characteristics.
High temperature alloys are consid-
ered in the same way that the equip-

Why some things get better all the time
The old-fashioned stove has warmed many a gen-
eration through the years. But today families are kept
healthfully warm by far more effective means.
There are electric heaters and electric blankets with
their efficient alloy heating elements. Individual gas
fuel installations. Improved heating systems for our
homes, ranging from oil burners with fuel nozzles of
long-lasting synthetic sapphire to the new panel heat-
ing with its welded piping. Also giving you finer service
are better insulated electrical wiring, vast central heat-
ing systems, and city and cross-country gas lines.
Far-reaching are the improvements in heating and
power enjoyed by families today . . . And most of these
improvements are possible because of better materials.
Producing better materials for the use of industry and
the benefit of mankind is the tvork of UMON CARBIDE.
Basic knowledge and persistent research are re-
quired, particularly in the fields of science and engi-
neering. Working with extremes of heat and cold—fre-
quently as high as 6000° or as low as 300° below zero,
Fahrenheit — and with vacuums and great pressures,
Units of UCC now separate or combine nearly one-
half of the many elements of the earth.

Since transportation is one of the
most vital factors in the economy of the
world, it is important that we under-
stand the advantages of the various
types of motive power in locomotives.
The oldest form, the reciprocating
steam locomotive, is simple to build and
operate. It can be built in units of very
large horsepower; reciprocating locomo-
tives of nearly 8000 indicated horse-
power are in service. It can be main-
tained with simpler tools and by less
skilled personnel than any other type.
It is reliable, and its first cost is low.
These factors have enabled the steam
locomotive to dominate thus far and
will keep it in the race for some time
to come. But it is facing competition,

Electric Locomotives
The electric locomotive has found its
place—and it is a big place—in the
American rail scene. In general the
electric system finds favor under one
or more of three conditions. When traf-
fic is heavy, trains frequent and fast—
as in the East—no other system can
maintain the schedules, under adverse
as well as normal conditions, as can elec-
trification. In mountainous regions
where grades are heavy, the high horse-
power available and the large short-time
overload capacity of the electric locomo-
tive are big arguments in its favor, and
the fact that power can be recovered in
the braking operation makes it addi-
tionally attractive. Also, where fuel is
expensive and waterpower is abundant,
as in the Northwest, complete electrifi-
cation becomes more attractive.
The electric system requires a high
initial investment, but the electric loco-
motive is unmatched in horsepower
available in a single unit. Also, it far
outdistances every other type in instan-
taneous and short-time overload capac-

ity. This is largely because it is backed
by a virtually unlimited supply of power
and because of the characteristics of
electric motors.
Electrification has several advantages
to compensate for its higher first cost.
The three principal factors in the fu-
ture are:
First, the demand for heavy trains at
high speeds, both passenger and freight.
The electric locomotive will always be
able to out-perform its competitors. As
the power demands increase, which high
speed requires, the economy of electri-
fication increases, and its field is corre-
spondingly broadened.
Second, cost of electric power has de-
clined steadily for many years. The
cost of fuels has shown a definite trend
upwards. As the cost of power is im-
portant in the expense of operating an
electrified railroad, this trend will ex-
tend the economic field of electrifica-
tion.
Third, the railroads will face stiff
competition in the future. They must
meet this competition with better serv-
ice. An electrified railroad gives the
best service known.
The cost per locomotive mile of main-
tenance for electric locomotives is only
about one third that of either Diesel or
steam locomotives of comparable ca-
pacity. With rising labor costs, main-
tenance is becoming increasingly im-
portant.
Diesel Locomotives
Much of the acceptance of the Diesel
locomotive is undoubtedly due to solid
technical merits — high efficiency (25
percent overall), high percentage of time
available for service, ability to make
long runs, and freedom from water, coal,
and ash problems that plague steam
locomotives. Another, and less tangible
factor, is something that can best be
described as "smart promotion," that is,
the streamlining idea, which has had
great popular appeal, a plus not to be
underestimated.
The great weight and length, while
mostly a disadvantage, entail a large
number of powered axles. From this
springs an incidental advantage—very
high starting tractive effort without
wheel slippage. This means that in
freight service a Diesel may be able to

Of

There's a heap of engineering in a
Hoover electric cleaner.
A typical model shown in cross
section above required 55,000 hours
of engineering research, study, and
work to get it ready for production.
This is a fair average figure for
new Hoover models.
The Hoover Company has been the
world's largest manufacturer of
home cleaners for nearly forty years.
To maintain leadership, and be first
with the latest and the best, Hoover
requires the full-time service of an
engineering staff of 130 . . . at least
a third of them graduate engineers.
This modern four-story brick building, total-
ing 60.000 square feet of floor space and contain-
ing up-to-date laboratory equipment, is the Hoover
Engineering Department.
The Hoover Cleaner is "born" in the develop-
ment engineering division, where teamworking
skilled designers, inventors and engineers plan to-
morrow's electric cleaners.
The laboratory division studies and tests, re-
jects or recommends each component part of each
new product "to be."
Mechanical engineers measure noise and vibra-
tion, design fan systems, study cleaning methods
and solve power transmission problems in develop-
ing new designs.
Electrical engineers develop and test motors,
wiring, switches, lamps, etc., designing the right
power plant and accessories for a Hoover.
Product engineers solve manufacturing prob-
lems, set up standards, see that Hoover quality is
maintained.

start or maintain speed of a heavy train
without slippage of the wheels, whereas
with another type of locomotive with
fewer drivers, an additional unit would
be required.
The Diesel is essentially a constant-
speed engine. It must be connected to
the drivers by some speed-change de-
vice. Electric transmission (direct cur-
rent generators and motors) has been
used on all road locomotives to date.
The characteristics inherent in the D-C
traction motor give the Diesel the high
starting tractive effort that has helped
make it popular with the public and
with railroad managements.
The Steam-Turbine
The steam turbine can effectively use
higher steam pressures, higher steam
temperatures, and lower exhaust pres-
sures than the reciprocating engine. The
limit to horsepower rating of a turbine
locomotive is set by the boiler, just as
with the reciprocating engine, but be-
cause the turbine is more efficient than
the piston engine, the turbine drive de-
velops roughly one fifth more horsepow-
er at high speed than the piston engine
from a given boiler.
Torque flow of the turbine drive is
smooth instead of pulsating, a great ad-
vantage, particularly at high speed. The
absence of reciprocating motion means
less wear, and fewer lubrication prob-
lems.
The steam-turbine locomotive is a
practical, attractive form of motive
power fully competitive to the piston
engine. A great weakness is the oldest
thing on it—the boiler.
The Gas-Turbine
The gas-turbine locomotive, like its
cousin, the steam-turbine locomotive,
has no reciprocating parts. That's good,
but the similarity almost stops there.
The gas-turbine locomotive requires no
boiler and no clean water with all of its
headaches to operating men. No one
will know its costs until someone builds
one or, better yet, several. However, it
should be cheaper to build than the
Diesel, will require less maintenance,
and—it is hoped—will eventually burn
coal. Furthermore, single units can be
built in as large capacities as needed.
In the gas turbines, the three func-
tions of combustion—compression, burn-

proves adaptability of GAS

An outstanding example of adaptability of Gas and Gas
equipment in successfully solving any industrial heating
problem is seen in the world's largest rotary furnace
used to heat alloy steel billets for piercing into seamless
steel tubing at the Canton, Ohio plant of The Timken
Roller Bearing Company.
Here, equipment engineers were called upon to build
a furnace for heating round billets up to 10" in diameter
and 12' in length, which would do the job more eco-
nomically than existing equipment.
The result is this Gas giant with 2100 sq. ft. of hearth
area and a capacity of 80,000 lb. per hour, when heating
billets up to 2250°F. Speed of the hearth ranges from 2
to 8 hours per revolution. Temperature control is fully
automatic and a single operator can determine the tem-
perature and location of each billet at any instant during
the heating period. Since the start of operations, this
Gas furnace has saved an average of 2% in scale loss
alone. Maintenance costs are at a minimum and six
men per turn were released for other plant duties.
Manufacturers of Gas-fired industrial equipment, co-
operating with Research Engineers of American Gas
Association, have applied Gas, successfully, to thou-
sands of manufacturing operations. The characteristics
of Gas make it the ideal fuel for industrial heating and
heat-treating.

ing, and expansion of hot gases, which
are combined in one mechanism in the
Diesel and hence must be successively
interrupted—are each accomplished in a
component designed for that exclusive
purpose. As a result, each can function
continuously instead of intermittently
as in piston engines. Furthermore, a
gain in simplicity results.
A gas turbine unit consists of a rotat-
ing compressor that feeds large volumes
of air to a chamber where fuel is burned.
The heated gases then expand through
a gas turbine that provides the power
to drive the compressor and some sur-
plus for useful work. There are no
moving valves or pistons, no reciprocat-
ing auxiliaries.

The simple gas turbine driving its
own compressor is essentially a constant-
speed machine and has no starting
torque. Hence, applied to a locomotive,
it requires a starting device and must
be connected to the drivers through
some speed and torque conversion mech-
anism. Its problems in this regard are
essentially the same as those of the
Diesel and probably will be solved the
same way—with electric drive, but the
appearance of a light-weight mechanical
or hydraulic drive might change this.
The gas turbine is also its own brake.
Energy can be absorbed on downgrades
by allowing the compressor to exhaust
into the atmosphere. The compressor
of a gas turbine consumes two thirds of
of the turbine output. Hence, with the
fuel shut off, a braking power of at least
double the engine full-load rating is
obtainable—more than is required.
There has been much talk about an
atomic-energy locomotive. This is ig-
nored here because the cost and the
problems of shielding from the radioac-
tive products are so great as to place
this locomotive indefinitely in the fu-
ture.

NATURE held the original patent on the whirl-

first put the idea to work separating water and
solids from steam to improve the performance
of boilers.
B&amp;W calls its adaptation of nature's destruc-
tive force to useful work, the Cyclone Steam
Separator. Its use in power boilers makes larger,
more rapid swings in power loads possible,
raises boiler and turbine efficiency and cuts
maintenance costs.
Development of the Cyclone Steam Separator
is but one of many examples of imaginative

A thorough understanding of the design
and application of Timken Tapered Roller
Bearings will enable you to solve at least 90%
of the bearing problems you are ever likely to
encounter when you begin your engineering
career after graduation.
When primitive man first made a hole in a
crude wooden wheel and slipped it over a
wooden axle he achieved the first function of
a bearing — support.
Support for wheels, shafts, gears and other
rotating parts still is the primary purpose of
bearings, but several other vital bearing re-
quirements are needed in modern equipment.
Ability to carry radial loads, thrust loads or
both together in any combination is one of the
most important of these. Ability to hold mov-
ing parts permanently in alignment is another.
Then of course there is the reduction of friction,
although this quality is common, in varying
degrees, to all anti-friction bearings.
The tapered roller bearing was introduced by
The Timken Roller Bearing Company nearly
50 years ago and today is universally used
throughout industry and transportation. Every
genuine Timken Bearing is unmistakably iden-
tified by the trade-mark "TIMKEN" stamped
on cup and cone.

Support Your Engineering Counci
One of the most important Engi-
neering College organizations, active on
campus and rendering the engineering
student body valuable service, the Engi-
neering Council, greatly needs the per-
sonal support and cooperation of every
Michigan engineer. Like other groups,
the Council had its activities curtailed
during wartime, but now, functioning
when Michigan's Engineering College
enrollment is at an all-time high, it is
extending its work and activities in an
effort to maintain its prominence and to
demonstrate again its value to the engi-
neers.
The Engineering Council consists of
one representative from each University-
recognized engineering organization
which is active on campus plus a rep-
resentative from each . of the classes.
The recent Council elections have
brought the group up to its fully planned
size, and now the members are busy
carrying out their special projects and
fulfilling their regular jobs. The Council
is organized to provide a link between
the different engineering groups in car-
rying out or coordinating their special
programs. It was established to serve the
engineering student body in a judicial
capacity, as through the Honor System,
or in any way which would benefit the
engineers.
The Honor System, mentioned above,
is the Engineering Council's pride and
joy. Established in 1926, Council mem-
bers have weaned it into successful ma-
turity as one of Michigan's traditions,
upheld it jealously when it was aban-
doned during the war years, and are
now holding it high on their banner of
aims and accomplishments for the engi-
neers. Officially, the Honor System has
not been reaccepted as an Engineering
College policy; actually it exists in
practice in almost all Junior and Senior
courses.
Under the Honor System, a student
pledges his honesty in refusing to give
or receive aid in an examination and
binds himself to report anyone whom he
sees cheating. Supported wholeheartedly
by all the students, this system is easily
and rigidly enforced; offenders are re-
viewed before a student Court of Honor
and are tried by fellow students. In
actual practice today, most students co-
operate in not cheating; those who do
not cheat, however, seldom report those
who do, so the enforcement of the Honor
principle is on a "catch-as-catch-can"
basis. If a professor (under the Honor
System, he does not proctor his exams)
should detect a cheater, he can flunk
him "cold," but that is all that usually
happens to the cheat. The system today
fails in 100% enforcement.
Therefore, each student must co-op-
erate more fully in upholding the Honor
principle. Also, there is little indoctri-
nation of freshmen, preparing them for
their responsibilities as upperclassmen,
and the Council's job is to bring about
better freshman preparation and to
maintain the high standards of the Sys-
tem. Engineers, your responsibility lies
in actively supporting the Council, by
raising your own ethical standards. If
you don't do this, the Honor System
will eventually deteriorate and will be
thrown out of use.
Another function of the Council is
to collect class dues during registration
before each semester. These dues are
used in renting caps and gowns for the
classes when they graduate. In addition,
the Council's administrative costs are
paid out of the class dues.
A sore point before the Council at
present is the conjested parking facili-
ties for bicycles. In endeavoring to im-
prove this situation for you engineers,
the Council has run into a series of
snags, both on the part of the students
and from the University. It is admit-
tedly difficult to set up completely ade-
quate bicycle stands in front of the
engineering buildings. Since many peo-
ple live several blocks from campus, and
are justified in using their bicycles to
save time and energy, the sidewalks in
and around the Engineering buildings,
particularly in the Engineering Arch and
in front of East Engineering Building,
are overcrowded with bicycles every day,
providing a safety hazard and a nui-
sance for those of us who use the side-
walks for their intended purpose—walk-
ing.
Attempts on the part of the Council
to secure more bicycle racks have thus
far failed. Several students have sug-
gested that University authorities have
racks placed along the wall of West En-
gineering (along the sides within the
campus square), and an additional rack
in front of East Engineering Building.
Whether or not these racks will be forth-
coming is not certain. At any rate, you
students should at least be courteous
enough to keep your "bikes" out of the
Engineering Arch and away from the
steps leading to East Engineering Build-
ing. There is no more thoughtless per-
son than one who will park his bicycle
where a lot of other people must crawl
or stumble over it. Your Engineering
Council needs your support in asking
for better bicycle-parking facilities and
in requesting their fellow-students to
prevent aggravating the situation by
keeping their bicycles out of congested
walks. Your united effort in demanding
better parking arrangements is the only
factor which will swing the proper au-
thorities over to your point of view.
These problems and many others oc-
cupy the Council's attention. A method
for student grading of the faculty, for
expressing students' opinions of teach-
ing methods, is one of the topics under
consideration. By showing your interest
in the Council's activities, criticizing the
Council when necessary, and by con-
tributing your ideas to the Council in
"engine-campus" issues, you engineers
can work together in bringing about
needed improvements on your engineer-
ing campus.
Last, but not least, the Council is
making preparations for the 10th Engi-
neering Open House, to be held in late
February—the first program of its kind
since 1941. A presentation of engineer-
ing displays, set up by each department,
will be the main feature of the Open
House. The exhibitions will be pre-
ceded by a banquet, attended by engi-
neering students and faculty. These
Open House programs have previously
been highly successful. Success for this
year's project will depend upon your
enthusiasm and support.
And so, you see, the Council is con-
stantly working for your benefit. Your
participation in its activities will insure
a steady improvement of the problems
which exist on our campus. I repeat—
support your Engineering Council and
build a better Engineering school, for
yourself and for the future classes of
Michigan engineers!
AMERICA'S OLDEST ENGINEERING COLLEGE MAGAZINE


Metallurgical Engineering
Metallurgical Engineering may
be roughly divided into two
broad and rather distinct fields.
11) The extraction of metals
from their ores, the production
of alloys and the shaping proc-
esses for both. 12) The devel-
opment and control of desired
physical properties by various
chemical, thermal and mechani-
cal treatments. This latter field
is called Physical Metallurgy.
In extractive metallurgy the
various steps proceed by unit
operations identical with those
used in Chemical Engineering,
with more emphasis placed up-
on handling and separation of
solids, and operations in melt-
ing furnaces. Knowledge must
be acquired of obtaining and
controlling the extreme tem-
peratures required to melt re-
fractory metals and alloys. In
physical metallurgy the prop-
erties of metals and alloys must
be studied from the viewpoint
of their inner structure as re-
vealed by the metallographer's
microscope. X-rays and other means, and processes of heat treatment and mechanical working must be adapted to yield
structures and surface conditions which have been shown to be most desirable in the finished product. The Metallurgical
Engineer therefore finds his place not only in the industries involved directly in the production of metals and metal prod-
ucts; but also to an ever-increasing extent in the industries dependent for their existence on metals and metal products.
Diminishing supplies of high grade ores and an increasing demand for new alloys of superior qualities make this whole field
one of ever-growing importance.

ENERAL ELECTRIC
FLIGHT TEST ENGINEER
The Story of
CURT TALBOT
AFTER he came on "Test" with
A General Electric in 1936, Curt
Talbot kept right on studying elec-
trical engineering, this time in the
company's general and commercial
courses.
Between hours of work and study he
went out to the Schenectady airport to
practice flying, piling up 500 flying
hours and obtaining his commercial
rating.
By taking lessons in both these
fields- and taking them seriously,
Curt was, unknowingly, giving him-
self the best possible preparation for
his present job- -that of Manager of
the new General Electric Flight Test
Laboratory.
During his first years with the com-
pany, Curt tested transformers, motors,
industrial control apparatus. He did
application engineering on paper-mill
and printing-press equipment. He
worked as a sales assistant.
But when the war placed a heavy
demand on G. E. both for aircraft
equipment and for men who under-
stood it, Curt's interest in flying was
remembered. He was assigned to work
on turbosuperchargers.
Today, ten years out of Illinois,
Curt Talbot manages a laboratory
large enough to house its own fleet of
test planes. He supervises the testing
of jet-propulsion and gas-turbine
engines, radar applications, turbo-
superchargers, aircraft instruments,
automatic pilots and control systems.
And he directs the use of the "flying
laboratory"—a B-29 especially equip-
ped for test flights.
Next to schools and the U.S. Govern-
ment, General Electric employs
more college engineering graduates
than any other organization.

Curt helped pay his way through the U. of On Test with G.E., he was assigned to high-
Illinois by repairing radios in his spare time. voltage transformers. He continued his engi-
He majored in electrical engineering. neering studies by taking G-E courses.

In his spare time Curt learned to fly. His
knowledge of engineering plus flying gave
him the opportunity, in 1940, of joining the
Company's turbosupercharger program.
Today Curt is Manager of the G-E Flight Test
Division. He directs the big new G-E Flight
Laboratory, center of tests on jet-propulsion
engines, gas turbines, etc.

One of the legends surrounding the making of Da-
mascus sword blades is that the smiths developed a
delayed quench consisting of thrusting the heated
blade into the body of a slave. This gave the re-
quired properties, but it was prodigal of manpower,
and inconvenient besides. The smith usually had
to leave town to do his heat treating in quiet.
Today, metallurgists can obtain properties they
need in steel by simpler, less improvident means.
A little molybdenum is one way of doing this.
It is a proved means of obtaining the harden-
ability that assures good performance in service.
Practical working data on molybdenum
steels are available from Climax upon request.

TO LIVE - THROUGH RESEARCH
The highways you drive on, the airplanes you fly, the house
you will live in, the radio and television sets you will enjoy in
the future—these and countless other features of the modern
world owe part of their development to research.
Today the Department is engaged in more than a hundred
projects—ranging from the use of steel in modern house con-
struction to electronic research—which will eventually result
in a higher standard of living.
All these things together comprise the aim of the Department:
A better world in which to live, through research.

electropult
The Electropult is a linear electric
motor more than a quarter of a mile
long. It is the latest answer to the
problem of launching jet-propelled and
heavy aircraft from shipboard or small
landing fields without the initial im-
pact of conventional catapults.
The Electropult is essentially a huge
electric motor laid out flat. The 1,382
foot track corresponds to the rotor of a
conventional machine. The small shut-
tle car which runs along it acts as the
starter. In operation, a plane is hitched
to the shuttle car which speeds down
the track and tows the plane into the
air. In recent demonstrations the Elec-
tropult launched a jet-propelled planes
at 116 miles an hour in four and one-
tenth seconds after a run of only 340
feet. Unassisted, the plane would have
required a run of about 2,000 feet to
take off. Running without load, the
shuttle car has built up a speed of 226
miles an hour in less than 500 feet.

Courtesy Westinghouse
Electropult
The Electropult is installed on a
2800 foot concrete runway, 100 feet
wide. The track is mounted flush with
this runway above a concrete trench
which contains the copper bus bars
that carry current to the motor. Sunk
into the concrete on both sides of the
track are rails to carry the shuttle car.
The shuttle car itself is eleven and a
half feet long, three and a half feet wide,
and extends only five inches above the
track. To harness the plane to the car
a bridle of steel cable is used. The
plane rides along the track on its own
wheels. When flying speed is reached
the car is stopped and the plane takes
to the air.
The power supply is housed in a sunk-
en concrete vault beside the runways.
A power-fuel engine starts the cycle.
This engine drives a d-c generator
which is connected to a d-c motor. This
motor in turn is connected to an a-c
generator and a 24 ton fly-wheel which
drives the a-c generator, suppling 12,-
000 kilowatts of electricity to the Elec-
tropult during the few seconds it takes
to launch a plane.
The Electropult has no apparent
limitations in speed or capacity within
range of requirements now foreseen. It
gains in effectiveness as the size of the
aircraft increases. Designs have al-
ready been completed for an Electropult
capable of launching the largest exist-
ing airliner at 120 miles per hour with
a take-off run of 50 feet.
marine radar in service
Radar, newest and most spectacular
of the war developed electronic arts, has
settled down to business on its first big
peacetime job—the task of protecting
shipping on the 185 mile Baltimore-
Norfolk run.
The new unit aboard the City of
Richmond provides navigational and
anti-collision protection in any weather,
including zero visibility from 100 yards
to 32 miles from the ship in every di-
rection.
Although modified military units have
been tested on several small craft the
installation is the first one of especially
designed marine radar equipment on a
long-distance passenger-carrying service.
The new installation is of the con-
tinuous-plan position-indicator type.
The picture is shown on the disc-like
face of a 7-inch cathode ray tube—sim-
ilar to those used in television. Water
surfaces are dark while any obstruction
—ship, buoy, shoreline, etc.—is indi-
cated in a bright fluorescent pattern.
Ships are shown graphically and shore-
lines appear as on a map. Readings are
taken at three ranges, at radii of two,
eight, and thirty-two miles.
For hazardous, close navigation—in
narrow channels or when approaching
piers or other craft—the entire 7-inch
view area of the receiver-indicator dupli-
cates a circle only four miles across.
The installation is in two major
parts: the antenna, mounted under a
large mushroom-like plastic dome atop
a5]/2 foot pedestal on the wheelhouse
rook, with the modulator preamplifier
and other radio frequency components
in the weather-proof base of the pedes-
tal; and the receiver-indicator console,

Radar scope
a cabinet two feet square and 148 inches
high located on the bridge. Power for
operation of the equipment is provided
through a below-decks rotary connected
to the ship's main d-c power supply. The
new unit operates in a frequency band of
9320—9400 megacycles.
moon-to-earth broadcast
A compact "rocket radio" weighing
less than 100 pounds, with sufficient
power to send its signal 240,000 miles
from the moon to the earth is tech-
nically possible. A 100-watt transmit-
ter capable of beaming ultrashort waves
from the moon to earth would weigh
less than 50 pounds. Its power supply,
consisting of several automobile stor-
age batteries, would require only an
additional 50 pounds.
Continuous operation during the trip
to the moon, estimated at 60 hours
with a speed of 4000 miles per hour,
would apply to heavy a drain on the
batteries. An electric clock mechanism
to turn on the radio for one minute
each hour could be easily arranged,
however. Operated in this manner, the
batteries would last for several days
after landing on the moon's surface.
The proximity fuse developed during
the war holds the keys to provide for
a soft landing for moon-bound rockets.
A tiny radio set would detect the ap-
proach of the rocket to the moon's
surface. This automatically would turn
on reverse rockets and turn off the
forward rocket power. By starting the
reverse power at the right moment in
this application, these proximity radio
sets would make possible rocket land-
ings without injury to the delicate in-
struments.

Items of Interest to Students of Chemistry, Engineering, Physics, and'Biology
The "Whitest of White" Pigments from Black Ore
It is a strange fact that the ninth most
prevalent element in the earth's crust
should have been regarded as "rare"
For over a hundred years after its dis-
covery in 1791. But that is the story
of titanium, actually more abundant
than zinc, copper, lead, tin, and nickel
combined. One of the factors that have
kept titanium from being better known
is the difficulty of handling some of its
compounds commercially.
If, as a student, you were to look up
the equations for the manufacture of
titanium oxide pigment, you might find
something like this:
FeTiO,. nFejOj* + (3n + 3)H,SO,—&gt;• Ti(SO«)j
+ FeSO« + nFez(S04)j + &lt;3n + 3)H20
Fej(S04)j + 2H* &gt;-2FeS04 + HjSO,
Ti(S04), + (x+2)H20—j&gt; Ti02 .xH20 + 2H2S04
TiOj.xHaO &gt;TiC&gt;2 + xH20
*—The exact composition of ilmenite
varies with the source of the ore.
From these equations, the manufac-
ture of the "whitest of white" pigments
from black ilmenite ore appears to be
chemically simple and straightforward.
However, the processing required to
obtain industrial titanium oxide of
sufficient brightness, hiding power and
fineness is more complicated than one
would anticipate.
Controlling a Metastable System
The final product must have a particle
size averaging 0.2 microns in radius and
varying between 0.1 and 0.5 microns.

To attain this end in
a metastable system
that is ready to go in
the wrong direction
at any time requires
exceedingly rigid
control conditions
throughout.
The essential steps
in the operation are:
1) The careful solu-
bilization of ilmenite
in concentrated sul-
furic acid to avoid
hydrolysis. 2) The
complete reduction of
any ferric iron to fa-
cilitate purification of
the solution, with re-
moval of any uncon-
verted residue and
colloidal slimes. 3)
Crystallization of 70
per cent of the iron as FeS04.7H20—
a critical operation in which tempera-
ture must be kept low and wild seed
crystals avoided. 4) Hydrolysis around
105-109° C.—the most important step
of all—because the initial particle size
and pigment properties of the final
product depend on concentration, tem-
perature, time of hydrolysis, intensity
of stirring, and presence of foreign ma-
terials. In this operation it is not un-
usual to talk in terms of parts per mil-
lion, rather than the usual analytical
accuracy of 0.01-0.02 per cent. 5) Vary-
ing salt treatment of the precipitate,
depending on the impurities. 6) Cal-
cination between 900-1000° C. to obtain
the desired particle size. 7) Grinding to
give the proper aggregate size. 8) Treat-
ment of the dried pigment in various
. ways depending on end use; e.g., in the
automotive, rubber, ceramics, paper,
linoleum, printing, or other fields.
Wide Diversity of Research Problems
Long and patient research was neces-
sary to develop the manufacturing tech-
niques now used. Some of the problems
demanded technical skill of the highest
order from the colloid chemist, the phys-
ical chemist, the analyst, the crystal-
lographer, the physicist, and other spe-
cially trained men. A wide variety of
instruments, such as the petrographic
microscope, the electron microscope,
x-ray diffraction unit, ultra-centrifuge,
and spectrophotometer were used in

this work. Finally the metallurgist, the
chemical engineer, the mechanical en-
gineer, and the industrial engineer had
to design equipment to handle this ex-
tremely corrosive system economically.
The manufacture of titanium pig-
ments is another example of the prob-
lems that constantly challenge chem-
ists, engineers and other specialists.

In Engineering Education
by
DR. CHARLES P. STEINMETZ
For ages the classics, comprising the
Greek and Latin languages and the lit-
erature of these two languages, have
been the foundation of all education;
but in the last two generations they
have been more and more pushed into
the background by the development of
empirical science and its application,
engineering. The flood tide of this
tendency has just passed, and it is be-
ginning to be realized that this narrow
utilitarian training has been a failure.
Few professional and business men with
it have reached prominence in scientific
and national life, and the urgent need
of return to a broader education is be-
coming more evident from year to year.
Ours is an age of science and engi-
neering, of industrial development and
progress. The unfettering of human
initiative and ability by the French
Revolution at the end of the eightenth
century and the opening of the vast re-
sources of our continent gave youth op-
portunities which never existed before,
and it impatiently chafed against wast-
ing time in education instead of "doing
things" by grasping the opportunities.
Fortunately for the intellectual prog-
ress of the race, these opportunities are
gone, and intelligence and knowledge
are replacing chance and grasping.
Education thus becomes the essential
requirement in determining success in
life.
Education is not the learning of a
trade or profession, but the developing
of the intellect, and the broadening of
the mind afforded by a general knowl-
edge of all subjects of interest to the
human race. These enable a man to at-
tack intelligently and solve problems in
which no previous experience guides,
and to decide the questions arising in
his intellectual, social, and industrial
life by impartially weighing the differ-
ent factors and judging their relative
importance. These problems—and thus
the educational preparation required to
cope with them—are practically the ■
same in all walks of life, and the gen-
eral education required by the engineer,
the lawyer, and the physician is thus
essentially the same. The only legiti-
mate differences are those pertaining to
the details of the particular branch of

Dr. Charles P. Steinmetz
human knowledge by which the student
desires to make his living.
The amount of human knowledge has
grown so vast that no single mind can
master it all. That means we must limit
ourselves to a part, usually even a small
part, of human knowledge—must spec-
ialize; and ours, therefore, has been
called an age of specialists. It must be
realized, however, that the value of the
specialist in the social organism is in di-
rect proportion to the general knowl-
edge which he possesses. Special knowl-
edge, no matter how extensive and in-
tensive, is of very little value if not in-
telligently directed and applied. This
requires broadness of view and common
sense, which only a broad general edu-
cation can give, but which no special
training supplies; special training rather
tends to narrow the view and to hinder
the man from taking his proper position
as a useful member of society. Examples
of this we can see all around us, es-
pecially in the business man, in the
lawyer, and, more still, in the engineer,
because the vocation of the engineer is
especially liable to make a man one-
sided. By dealing exclusively with em-
pirical science and its applications, the
engineer is led to forget, or never to
realize, that there are other branches
of human thought besides empirical
science equally important as factors in
education and intellectual development.
An introduction is best and most
quickly secured by the study of the
classics, which opens to the student
worlds entirely different from the pres-
ent—the world of art and literature, of
Greece, and the world of organization
and administration, of Rome—and so
broaden his horizon and show relative
values in their proper proportion and
not distorted by the trend of thought
of his time.
There have always been educated and
uneducated, skilled and unskilled work-
ers. But with the development of mod-
ern industrialism, a third class has
arisen between the skilled and the un-
skilled, the educated and the unedu-
cated—men trained to do one thing
only, but to do this very well and effi-
ciently. We call them piece-workers
when working for wages in the factory,
specialists when receiving salaries as
professional men. They are tools, use-
ful when directed by somebody's intel-
ligence, but useless to themselves and to
the world otherwise. The product of
many of our engineering schools and
business colleges is of this character.
Some of these men may become intelli-
gent and educated human beings and
useful members of society afterward, it
is true, but their schooling will not make
them such.
A skilled mechanic may finally spec-
ialize in one class of work, but that does
not make him an unskilled pieceworker.
An engineer, physician, or other profes-
sional may devote his time to one
branch of his profession; but so long
as he keeps up his interest in and his
familiarity with his entire profession,
and with all the problems of the work
surrounding him, he has not yet de-
teriorated into a specialist.
The greatest problem before the edu-
cated world today is the method of
broadening education to counteract the
narrowing tendency of modern life and
modern industrialism, and to produce
the intellectual development and broad-
ening of the mind which create not
merely intellectual machines, but citi-
zens capable of taking their proper
places in the industrial and social life
of the nation—men who can be trusted

■Hour Wage incentive Plant Provide
■Higher Wagei -find Uncreated Production
In less than 200 years, American in-
dustry has grown from small New Eng-
land shipyards and iron mines to the
colossus of factories that exists today.
Heavy metal castings, huge power
plants, powerful vehicles, large quanti-
ties of electrical equipment, chemicals,
and millions of other products are being
processed and fabricated every day. The
manpower required to bring about this
large scale of production is itself enorm-
ous—some 60 million people are ac-
tively engaged in producing the foods
and materials which maintain us and
satisfy the material demands of our
modern society. Of this number of
people, about 20 million are engaged in
what are called manufacturing indus-
tries—the establishments in which raw
materials are processed and fabricated
into finished products designed to fill
a needed service (mechanical, electrical,
or chemical) in our daily lives. Of these
20 million persons, half are actively en-
gaged in conducting and performing the
myriad duties necessary to manufacture
these industrial products. This body of
direct labor is responsible for the actual
production of industrial goods.
These people work to earn their live-
lihood and receive periodic compensa-
tion for their efforts, in the form of
money-wages. In order that workers
will be encouraged to increase their
rate of output, and to improve the qual-
ity of their work, industries have estab-
lished wage incentive systems which re-
ward the worker financially for high
quality performance above an estab-
lished fair rate of production. It would
be interesting and worthwhile for an
engineer's general knowledge to examine
the various incentive systems which
have been devised, to demonstrate the
effectiveness in American industry of
wage incentive plans, and to point out
the most important features of incentive
programs which must be considered in
setting up a successfully functioning
system.
First of all, the plan pays bonuses
to the workers, as incentives for in-
creased effort. These premiums above
the base rate of pay must be large
enough to provide the workman with a
stimulus to improve and increase his
output, and the worker must neces-
sarily exert himself above average ef-
fort to earn that bonus. Otherwise, any
extra payments are merely paternalistic
gifts from the employer and not indica-
tive of increased worker productivity.
The plans to be discussed are greatly
different in their separate details, but
they all have the common feature of
financial reward for the worker's added
effort.

Teamwork increases production
and wages
Then too, the plan should preferably
be simple for the workman to compre-
hend and easy for him to calculate his
wages. Also, the plan should pay the
worker all the bonuses that he has
earned, and the production standards
should be expressed in terms of time
required to put out a unit of product.
Many sound incentive plans have been
unpopular in practical use because they
shared an increased bonus allowance
between employer and employees. When
a plan has its production standards ex-
pressed in money earned per unit pro-
duced, many workers are excessively
suspicious of the hard-working engineer
who is trying to determine a fair rate
of production for the workman; the
worker links the standard-fixer with the
management and believes that he is be-
ing cheated into speedup production by
being forced to meet excessive minimum
production standards. When standards
are expressed in terms of time, the
worker can better understand whether
or not he must work too fast for his own
endurance; also, wage scale changes
will not necessitate altering the price on
each job, but will be accommodated by
shifting each worker's base rate of pay.
But more important than the plan
itself is the policy adopted by each
company in establishing and adminis-
tering its particular incentive system.
Given a plan for earning a bonus which
is easily calculated, the worker must be
granted guaranteed standards. This
simple bit of policy will dispel most of
the man's doubts about the manage-
ment's encouraging him to increase pro-
duction, only to establish higher stand-
ard production rates after he has proved
his ability to do a good job and has by
himself exercised initiative in increasing
his output. Likewise, the worker should
be assured of a constant base rate of
pay, to dispel his fears that manage-
ment will try to cheat him.
In establishing any plan, the com-
pany should explain all the details of
the system and the firm's policies in the
plan's specifications. Production results
show that a worker who is assured of
having fair standards permanently set
for his job will not hesitate to improve
the production process. If the job is
changed materially, rendering old stand-
ards obsolete, he does not fear the com-
pany when new standards are set for
the new job. By maintaining high qual-
ity requirements for work and by pay-
ing the worker well for his conscientious
efforts in achieving the desired grade
of work, the company will gain the
worker's respect and cooperation.
It is impossible to state the facts
and figures of a typical incentive plan
and accept them as ideal components of
an ideal plan. The level of wage rates
varies from one locality to another;
costs of living also differ; production
methods and manufacturing processes
are not easily compared in determining
fair payments to workers. Rather, only
as company managers improve their
personal relations with their employees,
in establishing wage rates equal to or
above the wage level of the surrounding
area and in providing generous oppor-

greater production of high quality work,
will a wage incentive plan prove its
worth—with high wages for the worker
and more production for the company.
Fear and distrust are the two main
deterrents of the successful functioning
of wage incentive plans. By cooper-
ating with their workers in paying them
fair, generous wages for honest, indus-
trious work, the managers of industrial
concerns have secured their workers' ac-
ceptance of their wage incentive sys-
tems, and the details and fine points
of the plan have not been sources of
friction and misunderstanding between
employer and employee. More and bet-
ter production, at lower unit cost, has
resulted; and both the workers and the
company have benefitted through in-
creased sales of the firm's products.
Fundamental Wage Incentive Plans
Wage incentive systems are divided
into two major classifications—plans
for individuals and group plans. Any
plan of each classification can be de-
fined and understood in terminology
common to all systems. A standard of
production is defined to be the time re-
quired per unit of production or the
money paid to a factory workman per
unit of his production. In either in-
stance, the purpose and function of the
standard is the same—to provide a basis
for calculating the worker's wages. Ef-
ficiency is, by definition, the standard
work-time requirement for a unit of
production, divided by the actual time
taken by the worker to produce that
unit. A base rate is the hourly wage
which, in most plans, is paid to the
worker when he does not attain a
bonus-earning level of production.
Straight Piece Work: Straight Piece
Work plans have been used for many
years and today are still the most com-
mon incentive systems being used in
American industry. Piece work plans
state that a worker is paid a definite
amount of money for a specified unit
of production; all standards are ex-
pressed in terms of money. A standard
quantity-production goal is established
by time study methods (to be explained
later), for which the man is paid his
base rate, and the worker is recog-
nized to be giving average output. He is
paid a bonus (a premium in addition to
his base rate wages), in direct propor-
tion to the added work turned out and
at the standard base rate of produc-
tion. Thus, he is paid everything that
he has earned.
Hour-jor-Hour: The Hour-for-Hour,
or 100 per cent Bonus Plan, is similar
to piece work to the extent that the
factory worker receives all the bonus
that he earns. The standards, however,
are expressed in time required per unit
of production. If a certain job or opera-
tion is specified to require one minute
or normal effort, then a man who con-
sistently takes one minute to complete
the job (reflecting 100 per cent effi-
ciency) will receive a normal wage—
125 per cent (or 120 per cent, varying
with company policy) of the estab-
lished base rate. (Normal effort is the
exertion necessary for the worker to
earn his base rate of pay plus a 20 per
cent or 25 per cent bonus, the bonus
varying for different industrial plants.)
He would receive his base rate if, in this
example, he did the job in 1*4 minutes
(80 per cent efficiency and average ef-
ort). For every per cent increase in
efficiency, above base rate, he would be
paid 1.25 per cent bonus. If he could
constantly perform the operation in %
minute, he would be working at 1.33
per cent efficiency and would receive
133 per cent of normal wages, or 1.33
x 1.25 x base rate, or 167 per cent of his
hourly base rate of pay. When wage
scales are changed and his base rate is
increased, for example, by 15 per cent,
his rates can be calculated without
changing the time study rate of produc-
tion. In any event, the man will be
given everything that he has earned
through increasing his production.
50-50 Plan: The Halsey 50-50 Prem-
ium Bonus Plan, like the Hour for Hour
plan, expresses work standards in terms
of time rather than money. Known as a
'split-bonus' plan, the procedure is to
take an estimated minimum time for
an operation (the one minute of the
previous example), add ^-minute al-
lowance instead of the %-minute differ-
ence between the base rate and the
normal rate of the Hour-for-Hour plan,
and split the bonus between the worker
and the employer. At 1% minutes, the
man would receive his base rate of pay,
and he would be able to begin earning
bonuses at 66.6 per cent efficiency in-
stead of 80 per cent. He would earn
slightly more on a 50-50 plan than he
would receive on an hour-for-hour plan
up to normal production, when the
earnings would be the same for both
plans.
Point Plans—The Bedeaux Systems
Point plans—very popular during the
1920s—introduced the 'B' as the con-
trolling unit of time for setting pro-
duction standards. Job operations are
specified in 'B's, 60 B's comprising one
standard base-rate hour of production.
Thus, a plan might establish 75 or 80
B's as a normal worker's output, and
the man would receive 125 per cent or
133 per cent of his base rate of pay. In
other words, an efficient person could
earn IOJ/3 hours of base rate pay for 8
hours of labor.
Measured Day Work: Measured
day work—instituted largely during the
depression years of 1930-36 and a dis-
tinct departure from most bonus plans
—combines the principle of incentive
work with the desire of the plant's man-
agement to curtail high production. A
job is studied, and a 100 per cent effi-
ciency rate of production (a normal
worker's output) is specified. It might
pay, for instance, $1.00 an hour. Then,
if a man's work averaged 80 per cent,
he would receive 80c an hour. After a
period of time—three months, perhaps
—his overall average efficiency of pro-
duction would be computed and would
establish his hourly pay for the next
three months. After each period of time,
his efficiency would again be computed
and would set his rate of pay for the
next period. At best, he could not rise
above the 100 per cent efficiency level
of production, and he could strive
merely to maintain his highest possible
rate of pay.
Group Plans: Group plans—estab-
lished for group incentive effort, in
tasks where several people can work
most efficiently in unison, such as as-
sembly lines, shipping and handling
operations, installation work on prod-
ucts too complicated and too large to
be handled by individuals—provide a
means whereby a number of people in-
crease their collective output and re-
ceive added compensation. The size of
a group is greatly variable, since the na-
ture of the job and the scale of produc-
tion must determine the effectiveness
of group effort for any given group size.
Many companies prefer from 10 to 20
or 30 men as a maximum group size, but
there have been instances of groups of
600 men and more in the automobile in-
dustry.
The group plans are essentially iden-
tical to individual's plans, with the ex-
ception that the hourly wage rates and
bonus compensations within the group
are determined by the particular work-
men's job classification or assumption
of responsibility for the group's efforts
and production. Thus, specialists, group
leaders, and even foremen and plant
managers are paid high wages and may
be further rewarded with bonuses for
maintaining high production.

EDITOR'S NOTE
Recently, in the Detroit area, the proposed
unionization of engineers and the partial
unionization of technician-groups composed of
junior engineers and engineering technicians
(draftsmen, test-men, laboratory workers, etc.)
tossed a bombshell into the already precarious
labor-management relationships. Since then,
much heated discussion, pro and con, has come
from both labor groups and management rep-
resentatives. Comment from engineers and
technicians, a relatively unorganized group of
industrial workers, has varied from emphatic
No! to emphatic Yes! The situation at pres-
ent is in a confused stale of flux, with the
unions attempting to sell their organizations
to these workers, with management fighting
these attempts, and with the confused engi-
neers trying to clarify their relationships to
both labor and management groups.
The following three essays were written by
Tau Beta Pi initiates in the fall of 1946, ex-
pressing their {student) opinion on the ques-
tion, "Should Engineers be Unionized?" The
opinions are those of the authors and are in-
cluded in the Technic for the purpose of
showing the variety of views prevailing among
engineering students and to stimulate thought
and discussion on this important problem.
'Nor-
Edward Roger Hotte
In the near future we, as young en-
gineering graduates, will be confronted
with the task of making many vital de-
cisions. These decisions will not only
affect us personally, but will affect the
company that employs us. They will
also have an effect on the entire coun-
try—highly industrialized as it is.
Of grave importance to all of us is
the problem of unionization of eng-
neers, which will undoubtedly confront
us. This problem is recognized as one
demanding considerable discussion and
fore-thought before action can be con-
templated or steps taken. With this in
mind, the American Society of Mechan-
ical Engineers, on November 8, 1946,
devoted their meeting to a discussion of
the organization of the engineering pro-
fession; with special attention to the
question of whether or not engineers
should be unionized. It was at this
meeting that Mr. D. Robert Yarnell,
engineer-industrialist and president of
the society, emphasized that "the en-
gineering profession can no longer side-
step its responsibility in the contro-
versial area of collective bargaining."
This responsibility, which " must be
shouldered by engineers, is the setting
up of harmonious industrial relations in
American industry.
How can engineers most effectively
take their place in America—is it
through unionization? It was the opin-
ion of Professor R. M. Sherlock, of
the University of Michigan faculty, that
unionization was a poor substitute for
the organization of engineers. The en-
gineer has no place whatever in a union,
since he is in a position midway be-
tween labor and management, and in
such a position would lose his individ-
uality to a great extent. Against his
sound engineering practices, the engi-
neer is required to bargain if he chooses
to be represented by a union.
Let us look deeper into the merits
and disadvantages of the problem of
unionization. It is common knowledge
that the plight of the young graduate
engineer is in a sad state, since his
salary is in a fifty per cent lower range
than that of the non-technical labor
type of worker. Plumbing, just to give
one example, is a non-technical field,
and its workers are reported, accord-
ing to an editorial in Forbes of October
1, 1946, to receive three dollars an hour,
or, based on a forty-hour week, one
hundred-twenty dollars per week. The
graduate engineer, on the other hand,
receives offers of fifty to fifty-five dol-
lars per week. Salary advancement to
reach the pay level of the plumber is
merely a matter of time but is definitely
not an over-night occurrence.
We might ask ourselves if we would
submit to union policy in order to right
this economic inequality. My answer is
emphatically, "No!" With this subjuga-
tion, under union membership, comes
the disadvantages of loss of individu-
ality, poorer workers being carried in
the successful wake of others, and the
lessening of necessary incentives for
advancement. Without unionization of
the engineer, we can vision the re-
sponsibility that he will undertake will-
ingly, remaining a leader striving for
greater perfection at all times. In gen-
eral, he will continue along the path in
which he has so highly distinguished
himself in the past.
This topic is getting no little atten-
tion from our professional societies who
fully recognize its importance. The En-
gineer's Joint Council, representing the
major engineering societies, has already
established a committee on the economic
status of the engineer. It is this same
committee that is conducting the two
very important surveys which I shall
discuss. In the first survey, to be com-
pleted by June, 1947, will be included
information concerning the earnings of
eighty-five thousand engineers in rela-
tion to education, years of practice in
the field, and specialization. The second
survey will consist of canvassing nearly
two thousand industrial companies to
find out company policies pertaining to
selection, training, placement, advance-
ment, guidance, and professional activi-
ties of graduate engineer employees.
When the information from these two
surveys is compiled and tabulated, a
more intelligent proposal may be pre-
sented.
Mr. D. Robert Yarnell, president of
the American Society of Mechanical
Engineers, in speaking for that organ-
ization, declared that "a sense of direc-
tion is very desirable and is expected
by our younger members. They want
some organization to turn to now, and,
if I understand them correctly, they do
not want the union kind." My opinion
on the subject of the unionization of
engineers can be best expressed by Mr.
Yarnell's statement as quoted above.
"YES!"—
William L. Sherwood
The question of unionization of en-
gineers has been raised time and time
again. The discussions in answer to
this problem usually present no concrete
solution. The older, more experienced
engineer who "can write his own ticket"
usually oppose unionization. The others,
in light of the general disapproval of
10
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


undecided. Since much is said against
unionization of engineers, and little is
said for it, this will be a short discussion
in favor of "unionization."
First, in order to get a better under-
standing of this proposed unionization,
let us list some of the more important
services it should attempt to give:
1. To raise the professional standard
of. the engineer, and of engineer-
ing.
2. To demand a wage in line with
this standard.
3. To assure the green engineer a
decent starting wage and subse-
quent increases for the first few
years.
4. To guarantee that engineers' opin-
ions will be given proper considera-
tion by the industrial operators.
5. To provide an employment serv-
ice for the profession.
Second, now that some of the duties
have been formulated, one must decide
what type of organization would be best
suited to carrying out these duties. The
suggestion of joining with a well-organ-
ized powerful union such as the CIO or
AF of L is ever-present. On a fleeting
glance, this proposition might seem to
be a good one; but as one looks deeper,
he will see that the engineer would be
but a drop in the bucket-full of union
members. His desires would not receive
the full attention they deserve and need.
In such an organization the majority
rule, and the majority consists of the
unskilled and semi-skilled laborers who
would have little interest in the welfare
of the engineer.
On the other hand, if the major
engineering societies formed a parent
brotherhood for all engineers concerned,
the duties listed above could and would
be faithfully carried out. The title
Brotherhood has been used to alienate
this organization from the word, union,
which leaves a bad taste in the mouths
of many people, and to signify the unity
of purpose sought for. Not only will
this brotherhood give us the grouping
desired, it will destroy the hopes of the
unions listed above to organize the en-
gineers into what would be an ineffec-
tive union, not working in the best in-
terest of the engineer. If for no other
reason, the brotherhood is needed to
protect the engineer from this calamity.
If one will conclude that the brother-
hood is the best type of organization,
he then must formulate a plan for its
organization, and how it might make
its voice heard above the thunder of
the big unions of today.
Since this is a professional organiza-
tion, it should have behind it at least
the "big four" engineering societies, as
noted above. All engineers would be-
long to their respective societies as they
do now. Those engineers working for
someone else in industry where collec-
tive bargaining could apply would be re-
quired also to join the brotherhood,
from greenhorn to chief engineer. The
society would formulate a starting wage
for green engineers in line with the
prevailing cost of living. In addition to
this, it would set up a graduated wage
scale to apply to the first few years of
the engineer's employment. It is under-
stood, of course, that these scales would
be minimum wage and can be increased
at the individual employer's will. After
a few years, the engineer should be well
started on his way and, from then on,
should be advanced according to his
own rate and ability, discarding senior-
ity as the basis for advancement ex-
cept where it is the employer's policy.
Of course, the employer would have his
right to hire and fire. It should not be
a purpose of the union to take away
from the employer the rights inherent
to him as many of the unions of today
try to do. This is primarily an organ-
ization to check-mate those employers
who would make personal gains at the
expense of his engineers.
Through the powerful voice of the
brotherhood, desirable engineering prac-
tices and standardizations formulated
by the engineering societies could be
more forcefully pointed out to the man-
ufacturer, for the good of the consumer
and industry as a whole.
One must look at the subject of en-
forcement of unpleasant demands. Since
the entire engineering staff would belong
to the union, in the case of non-settle-
ment of a grievance, the entire staff
would walk out. This, of course, would
soon paralyze the industry, since the
management usually includes many en-
gineers. Suppose a certain company
made a policy of hiring non-brother-
hood engineers, if any. This concern
would be put on the brotherhood's
"blacklist" distributed to all members.
Since the engineers directly or indirectly
do the purchasing, they could and
would make it a point not to buy that
company's product.
Thus, one can see that unionization
of engineers could be made desirable.
The only thing yet to be discussed is
administration of the brotherhood. It
must be made certain that no one man
can become czar and have controlling
power. A board composed of brother-
hood members elected at convenient in-
tervals would likely be the best solution.
This would tend to eliminate any pos-
sibility of "dirty politics" inside the or-
ganization and bribery from outside the
organization. Therefore, a workable
plan for organizing engineers into a
union is possible and should be given a
fair trail.

"MAYBE!"—
James D. Decker
Unions were first originated as guilds
to protect the craftsmen of the Fif-
teenth century from inexperienced men
invading their ranks. But they have
grown and developed with the progress
of industry until today they are chiefly
interested in increasing the laborer's
wage and bettering his working condi-
tions. The greatest single cause of la-
bor unions was the formation of large
corporations. The trust was a gigantic
institution whose sole purpose was to
make money for its stockholders. It ex-
ploited society in every way possible
and labor found itself helpless when
employed by such corporations. The ad-
vantages of the corporation to society
were great. Better articles were pro-
duced at a much lower price so that the
scale of living rose for all people. But
the question presents itself—has the
standing of labor advanced in propor-
tion to the benefits by society from in-
vention and in harmony with democrat-
ic ideals of equality? Labor found it
could best present its answer to this
question by forming into nationwide
labor units with the strike as its most
potent weapon.
Unions have certainly gained great
advantages for their members. These
include increasing wages, shorter work-
ing hours, better working conditions,
hospitalization, and welfare for the
employed; but at times these have been
gained at great cost to the worker and
also to society.
Professions do not fall in the same
category as common or semi-skilled la-
bor. The laborer, when businesses were
small, had a close connection with his
employer; but as companies grew and
trusts were formed, the laborer lost con-
tact with his employer. This is not so
with the engineer. He has moved into
the position previously held by labor.
The employer is more interested in the
engineer because development and com-

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


en Hie

One of the most amazing structures
on campus—a building which neither
zigs nor zags but which has neither
rhyme nor reason nor symmetry in its
labyrinth arrangement of rooms and
corridors—is the hut affectionately
known to all Michigan engineers as
East Hall. One of the University's an-
cients, East Hall is widely known as
Ann Arbor's No. 1 Fire-Hazard.
We of the Engineering College prefer
to think of the building as our "House
of Seven Gables," named thus because
of an inner beauty which is apparent
only when the eyes are closed and one's
imagination has been fired with mari-
juana.
Parallel to the above trend of thought,
a fanciful notion recently presented to
the Technic for approval proposed the
construction of an East Hall Annex.
The brainstorm, conceived by some in-
ebriated Civil Engineer using an astral
"transit" of mind, was undoubtedly
prompted by all the building activity on

campus, annexes being built onto an-
nexes and large size foxholes and sub-
terranean caverns excavated for our
burrowing, rodent-like aero engineers.
In brief, the plan consisted of the fol-
lowing absurd similarities.
A special crew of workmen with mini-
mum age of eighty years would be em-
ployed to construct- the annex—to be
named "East Hole" in honor of its de-
crepit companion structure. Interior
finishing would be of cellulose-impreg-
nated wood. Evenly spaced holes honey-
combing the material would insure ade-
quate ventilation for more rapid com-
bustion.
Double thickness, multi-colored cellu-
loid windows would necessarily replace
CTS
ordinary glass, since the common va-
riety does not burn and transmits such
excessive amounts of light as to cause
temporary blindness in students enter-
ing the annex from dimly-lit East Hall.
A perforated slate roof would allow
access of cold and warm air in winter
and summer, respectively, so that stu-
dents having classes in both East Hall
and East Hole would not find the tem-
perature change unbearable when pass-
ing from one building to another. An-
other unusual feature, the new annex
would have no doors, outside or inside.
It has been proven many times over that
such impediments to the free flow of air
prevent an adequate supply of oxygen
from entering a burning building, there-
by hindering incinerator action.
Application of the new military air-
craft cockpit ejection principle would
reduce construction expense consider-
ably by eliminating all fire escapes.
These are definitely considered unneces-
sary, as it is a foregone conclusion that
in case of fire the building would burn
with sufficient rapidity to allow no one
to escape by this means. Instead, all
furniture would have double thickness
pads of guncotton upholstery, thermo-
statically adjusted to facilitate rapid
exit of the settee at any specified tem-
perature.

As an added fire safety measure,
buckets of gasoline would be kept at
strategic points in each corridor for the
purpose of setting backfires—to save
the rest of the campus buildings in the
event of a major conflagration. (Con-
sult any local forestry engineer for the
definition of "backfire" when not ap-
plied to A. D. Moore's tricycle.)
After due deliberation and review, the
Engineering Projects Editorial Staff of
the Technic submitted a report on the
feasibility of the idea as follows:
A. East Hole Annex
1. Evaluation of submitted plan
(a) It won't work.
To analyze and interpret fully the
actual significance of this satirical prop-
osition, I determined to conduct a per-
sonal investigation. While nosing
through the corners of East Hall in my
capacity as one man grand jury, I ex-
amined the inspection tag of an old
acid-etched fire extinguisher. As proof
that the anonymous civil engineer may
not have been quite as full of "P Bell
hops" as was originally presumed, I
found lettered in age-dimmed German
script the words "Inspected by Kilroy—
1898."
In support of an opposite viewpoint,
a noted authority on geology, Professor
R. D. Brackett, takes the Sigma Rho

Tau stump in favor of his office loca-
tion. It is his contention that the fire
hazard in East Hall is actually much
less than in most modern buildings. His
theory, totally unsupported by present
fire insurance rate data, claims that the
aging wooden structure is rapidly ap-
proaching a state of maximum petrifica-
tion. Cold in winter and hot in summer,
perhaps, but it won't burn.
In fairness to both sides, I feel it
necessary to point out that partial or
complete calcification of wooden cell
structure would be difficult, if not im-
possible, under the conditions obtaining
in East Hall. In addition, it is rumored
that the voluminous quantities of hot
air liberated in Brackett's speech classes
have in reality oxidized the overhead
supporting members of the building,
with consequent structural weakening.
University authorities, however, are
hesitant to transfer the speech classes
out of East Hall, fearing similar dam-
age to some far more valuable building.
Perhaps someday, when time, state
allotments, building material supply,
and a number of other things are all
in proper accord, and with Cancer in the
Seventh House and Mercury cavorting
with Venus in some other house—such
as a League House—we may see the old
East Hall replaced by a creation far
beyond the alcoholic visions of our
boozed up civil engineer.

Sigma Rho Tau
After a war-enforced drought which
caused a curtailment of many of its
activities, Sigma Rho Tau is back on its
regular schedule of aiding the engineer
in putting his ideas across to the general
public by means of improved speaking
techniques, according to Prof. Robert
D. Brackett, Alpha chapter sponsor.
Intercollegiate debates with the Uni-
versity of Detroit and the Detroit Insti-
tute of Technology on the advisability
of establishing a Missouri Valley Au-
thority have resulted in a winning aver-
age for the first semester. In addition to
the exchange debates with these schools,
other speakers have participated in in-
dividual discourses on technical subjects.
Closer co-operation with the faculty
of the College of Engineering has been
a feature of the fall meetings, in which
the rear-engined auto, the Missouri Val-
ley Authority, and the question of
"Should Large Eastern Railroads Adopt
the Diesel Locomotive for Passenger
Service?" have been well argued, pro
and con. Professor C. O. Wisler ex-
plained the "Seven TVA" program;

Professor W. E. Lay opened the current
program on the rear-engined auto, and
Professors H. E. Keeler and E. T. Vin-
cent took opposing points of view on
the steam-diesel proposition.
At the conclusion of the training pro-
gram on steam versus diesel power, a
"board of directors" consisting of Pro-
fessor F. N. Menefee, chairman, Asst.
Professors C. W. Spooner, R. T. Liddi-
coat, and Mr. John Grennan decided
upon the purchase of diesel engines after
"salesmen" representing steam and die-
sel interests had presented their prod-
ucts' merits.

The post-war expansion of the society
was very much in evidence during the
initiations at which ten novices and
forty neophytes were inducted in cer-
emonies at the Sigma Rho Tau stump
and in the Russian Room of the League.
Later in the evening the 'Ensian pic-
ture was taken and refreshments were
served in the League Cafeteria.
Although open to all members of the
College of Engineering and students in
the allied sciences, Sigma Rho Tau es-
pecially welcomes juniors and seniors
who have had their academic speech
training and who wish to shape it into
a truly useful tool, a valuable asset in
selling oneself and that which one rep-
resents.
Tau Beta Pi
The election of Tau Beta officers
was held on January 9. Don Forman
was elected president; Art Shef, vice-
president; Herb Hammel, Engineering
Council representative; Art Bottum,
corresponding secretary; and Donald
Sagaser, cataloger.

Over $100 worth of steak, chicken,
and fish were devoured at Smith's Ca-
tering Co. on the evening of Friday,
January 10. It is rumored that a group
of fifty Aeronautical Engineers partook

of the feast. However, the only evi-
dence, was a slight creaking of belts
and a large number of contented ex-
pressions on said faces.
The banquet was held to honor Asst.
Professor of Aeronautical Engineering,
Franz P. Steinbacher, who came to
Michigan from Wright Field in the
fall of 1941, and who is now leaving
to take a position at the University
of Illinois. This banquet was also the
culmination of the major activities of
the organization this semester.
A. S. M. E.
In December the A.S.M.E. revived
the traditional "Roast," a student
and faculty banquet at which the
faculty members receive a thorough
grilling by the students. The present
"Roast" grew out of a mechanical en-
gineering banquet held in 1928 to
promote closer relations between the
faculty and students. At these ban-
quets, which were continued through

1933, it was customary to have a
speaker on some technical or social
phase of engineering. In 1934, the first
Roast was given, at which the faculty
members were the speakers on definite-
ly non-technical subjects. The "Spoof-
uncup," a trophy consisting of a tin
cup surmounted by a funnel with two
large tablespoons for "handles," was
awarded to the faculty member giving
the funniest speech. From such a be-
gining developed the informal question-
and-answer programs held prior to the
war at the annual A.S.M.E. Roasts.
Professor Hugh Keeler was chosen
as roastmaster, the referee. Prof. R.
Clay Porter won the "Spoofuncup"
with his humorous discussion of a
method to utilize the hot air accumulat-

ing in the classrooms of the University.
In addition, Prof. Porter was asked:
"How do you set a steam trap and
what would you suggest using for
bait?" to which "Powerhouse" Porter
replied, "I'd 'set' it on the floor and
use entropy for bait."
Other faculty members who have
proved themselves capable of taking a
"roasting" at former banquets are
John Grennan, (of Grennanized-Cast-
Iron fame), Walt Lay (the Carburetor
Kid), "Ax" Marin, H. L. Kohler, Ben
Dushnik, and Clarence (Fred Astaire)
Kessler.

homes
The great domestic institution, the
American home, amounts to much more
than a structure of wood, brick, and
mortar. Nevertheless, the house itself is
certainly an essential part of the home.
People must have some satisfactory
form of roof over their heads. In this
postwar period so many people are being
denied this basic necessity of life that
the present housing shortage constitutes
a public crisis. The veterans, hardest
hit of any group, desperately need about
2,700.000 homes. Besides the social im-
plications, grave economic consequences
are involved. The shortage constitutes
a very serious problem and an answer
must be found to the question—how
can we build enough homes?
The regular building industry has
been hampered in its efforts to alleviate
this critical condition owing to a lack of
lumber, of brick and mortar, and the
men to manipulate these materials. Its
capacity, however, is growing rapidly
and this increased activity will help the
situation immeasurably. But even if the
present industry reaches 100 percent
capacity, the housing problem will still
remain unsolved—there will still not be
enough houses to go around. Some solu-
tion must be afforded.
One feasable plan is that proposed
by the builders of prefabricated houses.
Their answer is simply to build more
and more of this type dwelling.
The urgent demand for housing has
focused much attention on modern con-
struction methods and materials. Since
today the time element is so vitally im-
portant, new techniques are needed to
supplement traditional time-consuming
methods of residential construction.
The prefabricator has experimented
widely in this regard and has developed
faster and less expensive ways of build-
ing houses. The prefabricator argues
that if the quality of the house he
builds lives up to the standards demand-
ed by the customer, and the dwelling
conforms to high standards of safety,
comfort and health, why not adopt his
plan?
A prefabricated house may be de-
fined as one having floors, walls, ceil-
ings, and roof composed of sections or
panels which have been shop-fabricated
prior to erection on the building
foundation. This is in contrast to the
conventionally-built house constructed
piece by piece at the sight. The typical
prefabricated house today is made up
of panels of convenient size for handl-
ing, usually not less than four feet
wide. A wall panel may be solid, or
may contain a door or window. Some
prefabricators make wall - size and
room-size panels. In this case, one side
of a room can be factory-built in a
single unit. A producer will have sev-
eral basic designs to offer his customer
and can provide him with an extensive
selection of exterior treatments.
buying a prefabricated house, the cus-
tomer is usually relieved of a lot of
trouble. Often the buyer can calmly
sit down with the dealer, specify the
type of house he desires and then relax
while the dealer and his staff evolve
that house from their wide variety of
panel houses. The dealer then becomes
the sole port-of-call for all details of
home construction, from design through
financing and legal particulars. In this
way the bothersome job of attending to
the endless details inherent in the build-
ing of even the simplest structure
would not fall on the shoulders of the
propective house owner. By thus inte-
grating the normal home's 30,000 parts,
the score of contractors and resultive
scheduling invariably associated in
building a conventional house would be
eliminated.
Several salient features regarding
new building techniques have been
developed by the prefabrication indus-
try and those organizations which sup-
ply the industry with its materials. One
of these is plywood adhesives; another,
construction glues which are self-bond-
ing. By glueing panels to the studding
of joists instead of nailing them, the

Factory fabrication of dwelling units speeds up the construction of houses.
What is included in the price of a
prefabricated house, of course, varies
considerably. At one extreme the price
includes only the shell of the house,
f.o.b. factory. At the other end is the
complete house including foundation,
the erection, interior and exterior finish,
plumbing, heating, electrical installa-
tion, furniture, and landscaping. There
are many arrangements between the
two extremes. Generally speaking, when
panel assumes part of the load which
is exerted upon the rigid member in-
stead of hanging as a dead weight upon
the nails or fastenings. In addition,
these glues have been hailed by econ-
omy-minded millmen because they can
use them to build up short and random
lengths of wood into beams and struc-
tural members better than the natural
ones. After the development of welded-
wood construction came plywood panels

PRESENTS
math prof.
Among the most capable and popular
personalities on Campus is Professor
Ruel V. Churchill of the mathematics
department. Upon graduating from the
University, Professor Churchill came
here to do further work. He accepted
an instructorship in Mathematics in the
College of Engineering and has been
here since.

Ruel V. Churchill
Professor Churchill's primary interest
lies in the field of applied mathematics,
in particular, that of boundary prob-
lems in partial differential equations.
He has many scientific papers published
on this subject and has written three
books; "Modern Operational Mathe-
matics in Engineering," "Fourier Series
and Boundary Value Problems," and
"Complex Variables and Applications."
The last mentioned is to go to press
very shortly. He is one of the few
mathematicians who showed why Heavi-
side's operational mathematics worked
after Heaviside introduced them with-
out explanation as to the reason for
their operation.
During the war Professor Churchill
worked with the Army Air Forces as a
research specialist. He was in charge
of the analysis section at Laredo Army
Air Field in Texas, and worked on the
problem of perfecting sighting mechan-
isms and methods of training Air Corps
gunners. In recognition of Professor
Churchill's scientific achievements his
biography is included in "Who's Who in
Engineering" and "American Men of
Science."
At present Professor Churchill is
quite active on campus. In addition to
teaching several classes and being in
charge of the mathematics group work-
ing on the "Wizard" project, he and
Professor Hay are in charge of the pro-
gram for mathematics majors and act as
advisors to those specializing in mathe-
matics.
In his spare time Professor Churchill
enjoys sitting down at the piano when
no one is around and playing some tunes
by ear. He cannot read music, but this
has been his favorite method of relax-
ing for several years. He claims to play
table tennis "at least vigorously if not
well," and also enjoys Bridge. His fa-
vorite outdoor activity is golf. Profes-
sor Churchill is also fond of "bottle
pool" which he often plays during lunch
hour with other professors at the Uni-
versity Club.
Recalling his undergraduate days,
Professor Churchill relates several in-
teresting facts. During his summer va-
cations in high school, he worked on the
building of a highway (using the pick
and shovel method) and also on a sec-
tion gang repairing railroad tracks. One
summer vacation, while a student at the
University of Chicago, he worked in the
fields of a Mennonite settlement, help-
ing with the harvest. He remembers
working from dawn to dusk, eating five
meals a day and sleeping on an army-
type cot either in a barn or in the open.
During one semester, Professor
Churchill worked in a biological supply
house near the U. of C. campus. He
did several odd jobs there among which
was the pickling of cats and of pig em-
bryos, gathering night crawlers in Jack-
son Park, and collecting clams and mus-
sels in a shallow lake.
Another semester he worked in a cafe-
teria and ran the checking machine for
his meals. He remembers seeing food
instead of numbers after adding up
trays for so long. He recalls seeing a
pat of butter instead of the number 2
and a slice of pie represented 10. It
got so that a column of numbers was in-
stantly envisioned as a tray or food and
the tray of food quickly transformed
back into the sum of the original col-
umn of numbers. At present, however,
he is more interested in other trans-
formations.
Professor Churchill believes the pro-
posed system of grading instructors can
be a valuable aid. He says that it op-
erated very nicely before the war and
was very helpful. The only problem
involved is the danger that the system
may get too complicated and require
more organization and work to keep it
operating than it requires or deserves.
He also enjoys working with maturer
students of the University level rather
than any other teaching level because
they are more interested in the work
and usually take the course because
they want to rather than because they
have to. He appreciates the lack of dis-
cipline problems in University teaching.

ALUMINUM BRAZING —
another victory of Alcoa Research
Problem: How to join a stamped
aluminum fan blade to a machined
aluminum bushing to make a fan
for portable electric tools.
Answer: Assemble the two parts
with a special aluminum alloy ring
in between and put them in a fur-
nace. The ring melts and joins the
parts together solidly.
This is an example of furnace brazing, a com
paratively new way of joining aluminum to
aluminum. It is another of the ways in which
Alcoa Research has made aluminum more use-
ful and more economical to fabricate.
Alcoa metallurgists first had to find an alumi-
num alloy that would melt at lower temperature
than the aluminum parts it was to join. Then, in
order to get a direct metal-to-metal bond, they
had to find a way to disperse the thin film of
oxide that covers aluminum.
Finding a low-melting alloy was relatively

simple. But it took years of per-
sistent research to produce a mix-
ture of chemicals that melted with
this brazing metal and removed
the oxide film. The discovery of
this flux made brazing practicable.
Such discoveries are not un-
usual when Imagination teams up
with Engineering. At Alcoa we
call it Imagineering.
Remember that—aluminum can be brazed.
Someday it may be the answer to your own design
or fabricating problems.
Remember, too, that the best place to turn
for answers to any problem about aluminum is
the place where the most research has been done
on this strong, light, versatile metal . . . the
place where there is the most knowledge about
its use. Turn to Alcoa.

EXPLOSIVES
by
DONALD RUTHERFORD
World War II saw the rise of exten-
sive use of explosive mines for defen-
sive purposes. It is one of the most
effective methods of impeding advanc-
ing troops. Explosive mines range from
the small anti - personnel mines with
only a few ounces of explosive in them
to mines capable of destroying the
heaviest armored tanks. To remove
these mines, the combat engineers used
many methods and techniques, includ-
ing mechanical and electronic devices.
The rate at which an offensive moves
forward is often dependent on the
speed that the mine fields can be
cleared. The Engineer Board of the
U. S. Army developed mine clearing
''snakes" to clear mine-fields, which is
a faster and safe method than the
manual method. Mine snakes are linear
explosive charges designed so that they
can be pushed into minefields or obsta-
cles by combat vehicles or 'shot' into
position by means of jet propulsion
units.
The first snake developed and used
in combat was the Demolition Snake,
M2. It is made of corrugated steel
plates bolted together to form two par-
allel tubes which are loaded with 10
pounds of high explosives per linear
foot. The forward 20 ft. and the rear
60 ft. are loaded with non-explosive
inert material. The snakes are 400 feet
long, 14 inches wide and S inches high
and when fully loaded, weigh close to
12,500 lbs. each. The front of the
snake has a pear-shaped nose attached
to it, to enable it to pass over or
around obstacles when it is pushed
from the rear by a tank. The diagram
shows the construction of the snake.
The snake is assembled as near the
field as possible, then towed to the edge
of the area to be cleared. After the
tank has moved to the rear of the
snake and engaged, the snake is pushed
into position and fired by a special bul-
let impact fuse with a machine gun.
Because of the construction of the
snake and the tank, it is not necessary
to disengage one from the other in or-
der to detonate the snake. If a mine-
free path longer than 320 feet is de-
sired, a series of snakes is used in suc-
cession. This application is demon-
strated in the lower left hand corner
of the drawing. The black rectangles

An artist's sketch showing the demolition snake M2, its uses and construction
represent the tanks; the lines, the
snakes; and the dotted rectangles, the
German minefields.
An improvement of the M2 snake is
the M3 snake, never used in combat
because of the cessation of hostilities. It
was found that the M2 produced a
crater that was not always wide enough
for tanks to go through and was ineffec-
tive in destroying certain types of
mines. The M3 is basically the same
as the M2, having the same dimensions,
but made of aluminum alloy plate to
reduce the total weight and containing
14 pounds of explosive per linear foot.
The M2 and M3 were effective weap-
ons against anti-tank mines but were
impractical for use against anti-person-
nel mines, being too heavy and cumber-
some. While the M3 is a larger
model of the M2, the Ml is a minia-
ture of the M2 snake with some rede-
signing. It can be carried by foot
troops and assembled in the field with-
out the use of tools. The snake is
propelled toward the objective by a
jet propulsion unit and is detonated by
a living mechanism. It travels at high
speed for a distance of 100 ft. and ex-
plodes, clearing anti-personnel mines
over a narrow path.
Another device now developed is the
Anti-personnel-mine-clearing Detonat-
ing Cable, Ml. It requires no assem-
bly in the field, being merely a length
of Primacord (explosive rope) with a
jet propulsion unit attached. It oper-
ates the same way that the Ml snake
does.
The bangalore torpedo is an old
standby of the Corps of Engineers. It
is a small, light weight metal tube con-
taining 9 lbs. of explosive in it. Trains
of these torpedoes are pushed by hand
through minefields and barbed wire
entanglements and exploded. Placing
bangalore torpedoes by hand is a slow
and tedious process but, more impor-
tant, dangerous to the operating per-
sonnel because of possible premature
explosions. To overcome these difficul-
ties, a rocket-propelled bangalore tor-
pedo was developed. These consisted
of 100-foot trains of standard torpe-
does with a special jet propulsion unit
connected to the train. They are ex-
ploded by a time mechanism.
The three types of snakes, the det-
onating cable and the rocket-propelled
torpedo were developed by the En-
gineer Board to make the job of the
combat engineer less hazardous, faster,
and more efficient.

important applications in other fields.
One piece of evidence: The 879 patents granted to Hoover on engineering

"Sorry," replied Satan, "my men are

to direct the destinies of the republic
during the stormy times of industrial
and social reorganization which are be-
fore us.
Modern society is dominated by in-
dustrialism, the outgrowth of applied
science; that is, by engineering. The
entire world has been united, and
whether we travel through European
countries, or see the civilization of the
Far East, we find no material differ-
ences from the intellectual and social
conceptions of our country. Thus, the
broadening effect of the study of other
nations and countries has largely van-
ished. Wherever we go, we meet simi-
lar conditions—the same scientific and
religious beliefs, the same organization
of society—and we are very liable to
draw the conclusion that our conditions,
our beliefs, our form of society are the
best and the only feasible ones; that
civilization could not exist without
them, and that any radical change
would be destructive to civilization. But
self-satisfaction means stagnation, and
stagnation means decay; and herein lies
the foremost danger to our civilization.
The remedy is knowledge of and
familiarity with another civilization,
different from ours in character, su-
perior in some respects, inferior in
others.
Nobody familiar with Greece in its
prime can ever believe that art, science,
and literature cannot exist in the freest
form of democracy which the world has
ever seen—a democracy so free and un-
restrained as to be almost anarchism.
Nobody familiar with the Alexandrian
period can deny that science can flour-
ish under an autocratic monarchy. A
purely communistic nation held Greece
for centuries. For centuries the central-
ized federal government of Rome main-
tained the peace and guarded the civili-
zation of the entire civilized world, and
many countries under Rome's domina-
tion enjoyed a civilization which they
had never reached before.
It is the difference of the ancient
civilizations from the present which
makes the study of the classics of im-
portance and almost of necessity in
order to counteract the equalizing and
levelling tendencies exerted by present-
day conditions and to give the broaden-
ing which is the most important object
of education.
This article was originally a speech
given by the author in 1913. It was
later revised, and was published as it

WORLD LEADERSHIP

IN THE ABRASIVE INDUSTRY
It has been achieved by Norton Company
by seventy years of scientific research.
Norton made grinding wheels 'way back in 1877
. . . has since contributed countless outstanding
developments to the abrasive industry . . . and
in 1946 introduced 32 ALUNDUM abrasive
—the most sensational development since the
first manufactured aluminum oxide abrasive
(trade-marked ALUNDUM) in 1901. This new-
est member of the Norton family has given to
the metalworking world an abrasive with each
super-cutting grain a single crystal, individually
produced in the electric furnace.
The Norton plant at Worcester, Mass. is the
world's largest for the manufacture of abrasive
products. And there are other Norton plants
in Bauxite, Arkansas; Hamilton and Chippawa,
Ontario; Welwyn Garden City, England; La
Courneuve, France; Wesseling, Germany; Cor-
sico, Italy; New South Wales, Australia.

Plans jor Individuals: A comparison
of the most widely used individual-in-
centive plans, through a study of the
charts in figures 1, 2, 3, and 4, will
give a clearer picture of relationships
between the systems. The base rate is
the same for all plans. In figure 1, the
Hour-for-Hour plan pays a uniformly
increasing bonus for increasing produc-
tion per unit time, beginning at 100 per
cent efficiency. At 80 per cent effi-
ciency, the worker is earning his base
rate—or a 20 per cent bonus, if pay
above base rate and up to 100 per cent
efficiency is considered to be normal in-
centive reward and not strictly a bonus
payment. At 60 per cent, he would be
earning a 40 per cent bonus, but he ac-
tually receives his base rate of pay. The
50-50 plan, also, begins paying out
bonuses at its 100 per cent efficiency;
converted to the Hour-for-Hour effi-
ciency scale, bonuses for the 50-50 plan
start at 83.3 per cent. At 125 per cent
production, both plans are paying the
same wages, but over 125 per cent, the
Hour-for-Hour plan pays more money
to the workman. The 50-50 plan is
higher paying up to 125 per cent, but
INCENTIVES PAY OFF

lower paying above 125 per cent effi-
ciency.
These two systems, when studied in
figure 2 for unit labor costs at varying
efficiencies of production, show that,
when the Hour-for-Hour plan guaran-

tees base-rate pay for production, labor
costs decrease until normal production
is reached at 100 per cent; beyond
100 per cent, the unit costs remain con-
stant, and the workers are paid for what
they produce. The 50-50 plan, however,
results in steadily decreasing unit costs
of labor throughout its performance,
since the worker is always sharing his
bonuses with his employers.
The bonuses paid out in the Bedeaux
and Hour-for-Hour plans are similar,
in figure 3, except that the Bedeaux
plan provides a higher percentage bonus
for normal production and, conse-
quently, is on a slightly higher pay-level
than the Hour-for-Hour plan. Unit
labor costs, in figure 4, are equal for
both plans until the Bedeaux plan, at
93.3 per cent H.-for-H. efficiency, re-
mains constant at a higher level than
the Hour-for-Hour plan. This means
that each plan pays base rates until its
normal production is reached, after
which the workers are paid for exactly
what they produce. The Bedeaux plan
pays a bonus at a lower level of effi-
ciency than the Hour-for-Hour plan.
Previous to bonus payments, the
worker, earning base rate pay, lowers
unit costs through increased produc-
tion accompanied by a constant rate of
pay.
Production Standards and
Base Rates of Pay
All of the wage payment plans differ
greatly in their detailed descriptions
and methods of computing bonuses.
They are examples of the infinite va-
riety of plans which could be devised

Why Condensers
now live longer
Testing and setting standards for ma-
terials is a vital part of production at
Western Electric.
Take, for example, the tissue paper
—about 1/10 the thickness of a hu-
man hair—used as insulation between
the turns of aluminum foil in millions
of "paper" condensers for the Bell
System.
Condenser life is generally in direct
proportion to the quality of tissue
used. In studying effects of differ-
ences in chemical composition, fibre
structure, thickness, pinholes and
other properties to set a standard of
quality, engineers found intrinsic
variables so great that a method of
rating had to be developed.
They solved this problem by mak-
ing sample condensers using each
type of paper and checking them at
high temperatures and high voltages
to determine life expectancy.
Correlating results of these acceler-
ated life tests with manufacturing
data led to improved paper making
methods —paper manufacturing ma-
chines of new designs—increased pro-
duction of the right kind of paper—
longer-lived condensers.
It's hard to hurry
a Switchboard
One of the major problems faced by
Western Electric engineers in the rush
to make telephone switchboards fast
—to meet unprecedented demands-
is the complexity of manufacture in-
volved.
A recent study of what it takes to
make a certain much-needed type of
manual switchboard installation con-
sisting of ten operator positions will
give you some idea of the complexity.
Here are the principal items of appa-
ratus required: 5,680 relays; 19,500
jacks; 15,000 lamps of various kinds
plus their lamp sockets and mount-
ing; 17,000 lamp caps of various col-
ors and designations; 450 mounting
plates of relays, condensers and resist-
ances; 580 resistances; 550 condens-
ers; 360 fuses; 691 jack spaces and a
total of 1,071,000 conductor feet of
wire and cablel

In spite of this complexity, Western
Electric is speeding switchboards on
their way. Production in 1946 of
manual switchboards is expected to
break a record of 16 years' standing.

Problem for
Production Engineers
Easy? Not when it means providing
machine capacity for welding a bil-
lion precious metal contacts per year
— five times the previous maximum
production rate! This problem was
one of the most critical faced by
Western Electric engineers in meet-
ing tremendously increased demands
for telephone equipment.
A pair of these contacts is required
at every point in telephone circuits
where current is interrupted in switch-
ing. They minimize "noise" in your
telephone receiver. They're made of
bi-metal tape—the contact surface is
paper-thin precious metal, usually
palladium. The balance is less expen-
sive metal such as nickel.
By providing recently developed
electronic control equipment and
making mechanical improvements in
the precision welding machines —
which must cut off small pieces of
tape, accurately position them on
telephone apparatus parts and weld
them securely—the engineers pushed
operating speeds to a new high.
Result: only about two-thirds as
many hard-to-get new welding ma-
chines were needed — a half-million
dollars were saved — and welds of
higher quality are being produced at
the rate of a billion a year!
Manufacturing telephone and radio apparatus for the Bell System is Western Electric's primary job. It calls
for engineers of many kinds — electrical, mechanical, industrial, chemical, metallurgical — who devise
and improve machines and processes for large scale production of highest quality communications equipment.

layouts. But they have one thing in
common which is the focal point around
which all these plans revolve. That is
the standard production rate, coupled
with the base rate of pay, which must be
established as a foundation for comput-
ing bonus earnings from exceptional
production. The base rate is defined
as the standard hourly wage, adjusted
to fit the level of living in the produc-
tion area, which should be paid for an
average hour's work-effort when the
workman is working at the fastest pace
which he could maintain the whole
work-day without becoming fatigued
or without the slightest injury to his
health.
There are two procedures which
combine to establish the base-rate
standard level of production. One is a
system of time and motion study, and
the other is a method of job evaluation.
Time and Motion Study
Time and motion study includes a
complete analysis of the job to be per-
formed and an attempt to improve pro-
duction by the utilization of more effi-
cient machine tools, simpler jigs and

analyst, an engineer, makes a complete
study of the job as set up, breaking all
machining and handling movements
down into simple elements.
If a job setup has been materially
changed and subsequently approved by
the plant manager, the analyst then
studies the motions of the worker per-
forming the necessary operations of the
job. Breaking down all motions into
their simplest components will reveal to
the engineer where energy is being
wasted in handling the job. Then he
will set up what he believes is the
smoothest, fastest, most efficient with-
out being fatiguing, series of motions
for the worker and the machine instal-
lation.
The time study man must decide
when the worker is working at the base-
rate speed which has been previously
defined. After studying the cyclic na-
ture of the operations and recording
and averaging the time required to do
the job at a pace for base rate, he will
make percentage allowances for fa-
tigue and the personal needs of the
operator. He has then computed the
standard time necessary for the job, and
announces his findings to the operator
and to the company. This rate of pro-
duction is in effect for a trial period. If
it is unchallenged by either the operator
or the company, as being too high or
too low, the rate is usually established
permanently. By common practice, only

do you know how it can be used to bring out
the drama and excitement of ideas... products

With motion pictures, you can put new life,

Job Evaluation
Job evaluation enters the picture in
translating a man's production into
money wages. A point system is usually
employed in determining a man's quali-
fications for a job and additional char-
acteristics which should earn him a
higher wage than he might get merely
by having the responsibility of repeat-
ing the necessary operations for the job.
The factors which contribute to a better
product are listed, and the man is rated
for each factor.
The man's education may receive 10
points out of a maximum 15 points, his
experience in the work he is doing, his
initiative, the physical effort required
for the job, mental effort, responsibility
for equipment and materials, amount of
inspection of the job which the worker
can accomplish, working conditions,
hazards—all are given point ratings.
The total points, compared with a grad-
uated point-pay scale, will determine
the man's hourly base rate of pay. With

skill on the job, so that he can increase
his efficiency and earn higher bonuses.
Bonus Plans Administrative Features
Any wage incentive plan can be de-
scribed in a general manner, but there
are always so many details relating to
the actual installation and administra-
tion of a plan that most manufacturers
adopting wage incentive plans compile
in pamphlet form these related details,
in addition to a complete description
of the plan itself. Topics which must be
included are company policy in the es-
tablishment and guarantee of standards,
allowances for work done on non-incen-
tive jobs, the details of the computa-
tion of bonuses, quality control of the
worker's production, and lesser sub-
jects.
Company policy is declared, to the
effect that standards are permanent un-
less rendered obsolete by new manufac-
turing processes or operation procedures.
When a standard has been newly set,
however, it is in effect on a temporary
basis, to determine its usefulness and
accuracy. When a department is con-
verting from a non-incentive system of
pay to an incentive system, the com-
pany must clearly state the provisions
of the new plan, to prevent misunder-
standing and to secure cooperation from
the workers.
Allowances are specified, being in-
corporated into the base standards of
the job or defined as when a man will
be granted day-rate pay because of un-
foreseen happenings on the job. Thus,
allowances for fatigue and personal
needs are included in the time study's
base rate. Likewise, a worker in train-
ing or working on special and non-
standardized jobs receives a definite

The world of the future will be a world
of wheels to a greater extent than ever
before. The development of new kinds
of production and transportation equip-

of meeting new conditions of speed, pre-
cision, load capacity and endurance.
Then the same bearings that have con-
sistently and successfully anticipated so
many revolutionary developments for
more than 48 years, again will rise to
the occasion with the same versa-

more. Also, a delay in the job, caused
by an accident for which the worker is
not responsible, is paid for by the com-
pany in day-rate wages.
Bonus accounting takes many forms.
The worker may receive his monthly
bonus over and above his standard
wages, or payment may be made as
often as his regular pay check is issued
and may be included in that pay-check.
The workman may have his bonuses re-
duced by not maintaining quality stand-
ards for his work. This deduction may
be determined by a periodic inspection
of his work or may be computed in di-
rect proportion to the rejects which may
appear through 100 per cent inspec-
tion of his product. Whenever an oper-
ator works on several jobs in one day.
each job having different standards of
production and base pay, he must make
out a report of the time spent on each
job, so that his wages for each job can
be accurately calculated.

included companies whose employees
ranged from 250-30,000 men, the me-
dian employment being 1,800 men and
the average employment 3,617 men.
Answers to questions on motion study
revealed that 55 per cent of the firms
use process charts in analyzing jobs to
improve methods of operation and
handling (a process chart is a complete
listing of the operations of a job and in
the performance-sequence of the opera-
tions); 16 per cent of the companies
went so far as to utilize motion pictures
of the operations to study the jobs and
preserve their performance for the com-
pany records. In 82 per cent of the
firms, an analysis of the jobs was made
before time studies were attempted.
Time study replies showed that the
average time to train a competent time
study man was 17.6 months. The time
studies, in 96 per cent of the firms, were

WHAT 90 YOB SEE IN THE FUTURE?
Seventy-five years AGO half of the people of the United States were farmers.
Life was simple in those days.
Every farmer knew just how much he had to raise on his land in order to support his
family.
Every blacksmith knew how many horses he had to shoe in order to buy his wife a new
dress.
Every farm-hand and blacksmith's helper knew how his wages depended upon his useful-
ness to the man who shared his income with him.
Life seems more complicated today.
Just about now the world appears to be in pretty much of a mess. Some of us are lost
completely in the wilderness of theories and "isms" that surround us and have given up
trying to find our own way. Many of us arc following the leadership of guides who are
taking us in many, widely opposite directions without our noticing this fact. We are
behaving like lost hunters who refuse to trust their own compasses.
And yet, life is as simple as it always has been to those who follow the only guide that
can take them to their desired goal—their own "horse-sense," their own conscience.
All the theories and isms cannot alter the fact that lire depends upon our ability to earn
a living. All the theories and isms cannot change the fact that our American way has
produced the greatest nation on earth, enjoying the world's highest standards of living.
All the theorists and neoists cannot change these fundamentals:—
Business is the exchange of money for goods and services. Our earning power depends
upon our ability to supply these goods or services.
But our earning power also depends upon our neighbors. We can prosper only as our
community prospers—as our country prospers—and as the company prospers with which
we are connected.
Learning these simple fundamentals is, in itself, a great achievement. It will solve most
of our problems. Too many people go through life beating their heads out against them.
Too many people fail to realize that these simple fundamentals are the basis of all sound
business —that they are the key to every man's welfare.
Let those of us cling to these fundamentals who want our children to inherit a country
that continues to offer freedom and equal opportunity for all.

per cent of the plants and daily in 43
per cent. Bonus earnings and effi-
ciencies were not posted in 47 per cent
of the plants and were posted in 34 per
cent—daily, 22 per cent, and weekly,
12 per cent. Almost 72 per cent of all
direct labor (actual production opera-
tions) hours were covered by wage in-
centive plans. The average efficiency oj
employees, previous to the installation
oj wage incentive plans, was 69 per
cent oj normal production, and it rose
to 121 per cent ajter the installation oj
incentive methods.
Conclusions
Bonus systems for laborers are in-
finitely varied in their description and
use. There are, however, basic features
of incentive plans which are common to
all systems. These are the standard pro-
duction rates and the base rates of pay.
The successful functioning of any bonus
program rests primarily upon setting
up a fair rate oj production, establish-
ing a base wage rate which corresponds
with the economic requirements of the
work area, providing a money stimu-
lus for the worker in earning a sub-
stantial bonus, and in removing the
workers' jears about poor incentive plan
practices—raising production rates as
production increases, changing a job
slightly to set a new, higher production
rate, and any other attempts of man-
agement to cheat the workmen out of
their incentive rewards. As the work-
ers' confidence in an incentive system
grows, their performance will improve,
and the net results are greater, less
costly unit production for the indus-
trial concern, and fatter pay checks for
the workers.

PROBLEM: You are designing a valve grinding machine. You have to
provide a drive for the chuck that holds the valve stem. This chuck
must be adjustable in three different directions. Your problem now is to
devise a method of driving the chuck which permits these adjustments.
How would you do it?
THE SIMPLE ANSWER:
Use an S.S.White power
drive flexible shaft to
transmit power to the
chuck. The shaft provides
a positive, dependable
drive that permits free
movement of the chuck in
any direction.

This is just one of hundreds
of remote control and
power drive problems to
which S.S.White flexible

petition are the employer's chief con-
cerns, although, at present, during this
transient situation, acquiring production
is his chief obstacle.
Labor must be treated as a commod-
ity and engineers are no exception.
Their wage rate must follow the supply
and demand curve as well as their value
to industry. The engineer should real-
ize this and have the foresight to create
a demand for his services. Because his
training deals with the development of
industry and industrial practice, the en-
gineer is better equipped to make a place
for himself than other professional men.
Labor has lost ability, its most valu-
able assest, with the advent of highly
mechanized and controlled production.
And as time goes on, it is losing it more
rapidly. This is due largely to union
trouble and the beliefs they have in-
stilled in labor. Every operation has
been worked out beforehand and merely
entails following direction. Industry is
realizing more every day that higher
production can be reached by relying on
mechanical controls rather than by rely-
ing on the ability and ingenuity of la-
bor. This does not apply to engineers.
The engineer has spent at least four
years in training, and his ability to pro-
duce and cope with problems which arise
determines his value; the intelligent
employer realizes this value. The engi-
neer must not lose his greatest assest—
ability.
If engineers were unionized, a number
of results could be predicted. First, it
would create friction between the em-
ployer and all engineers because of the
methods used by unions in fighting for
their demands. Secondly, it would
create friction among engineers them-
selves because a union would place each
of them on the same plane, thus allow-
ing irresponsible and incapable men to
hold positions above their ability. There
would be little, if any, incentive. And,
finally, these would all result in slow-
ing up production at a cost to the em-
ployer and his company, which in real-
ity means increased costs for the con-
sumer. The standard of living would
decrease rather than increase.
Labor has only one organization to
promote its betterment, and that is the
union. Engineers have their professional
organizations which, although their aim
is promoting the profession, could be
the basis of unionizing engineers if they
should ever become an oppressed group.

No moisture can seep through the scums of these raincoats — thanks to
the electronic sewing machine developed at RCA Laboratories.
sewing machine... without a needle or thread!
Since mankind first began to sew, say
15,000 years ago, seams have always
meant "needle and thread."
But when new thermoplastic materials
came along —specially developed for
waterproof coverings such as raincoats —
ordinary "needle and thread" seams
wouldn't do because of their tiny holes.
Now —thanks to research at RCA Lab-
oratories—goods made of thermoplastics
are "sewn" by electrons and the seams are
as strong as the material itself!
This will make possible dozens of brand-
new uses for these inexpensive and durable
thermoplastic materials. Even today they
provide perfect packages for foods, meats
and drugs because they are completely
watertight, airtight and transparent. You've
probably seen thermoplastic raincoats, to-
bacco pouches, shower curtains ...
Research, such as resulted in the elec-
tronic sewing machine, is reflected in all
RCA products. When you buy an RCA
Victor radio or television receiver or any-
thing bearing the name RCA, you enjoy a
unique pride of ownership in knowing that
you possess one of the finest instruments of
its kind that science has vet achieved.

arches may have almost any size and
follow almost any pattern which the
architect's creative mind fancies. Ply-
wood panels are being widely used for
exterior construction now since the
phenolic resin adhesives are waterproof
and don't delaminate. Plywood's cross-
banded grains improve on nature's
building material by providing strength,
preventing warping and opening of
joints.

Mass production methods reduce cost
of housing units
The long-range outlook for the pre-
fabricated home industry looks fairly
bright, the main obstacle in its pro-
gress being marketing and distribution.
Also, labor opposition, outdated build-
ing codes, and the poor impression of
the prefabricated house gained from
emergency war housing stand in the
industry's path of development.
Nevertheless, a housing dilemma
faces the nation now and the problem
must be met with swiftness and a so-
lution effected. The prefabricator's
method enables a contractor to receive
a house in one shipment. This saves
the latter's time, energy, and delay
connected with seeking materials.
Quonset huts, cantonments and tents
are a far cry from the serviceman's idea
of home. Yet, in many cases, he has had
to renew his acquaintance with them
since becoming a civilian. The prefabri-
cator can build and design attractive
houses to suit him.

let but as yet uncollapsed, can now be
taken with ease. Though unimportant,
perhaps, they indicate the possibilities
of a new type of x-ray machine that
offers possibilities in any field where
motion, impacts, vibrations, and other
actions impossible to photograph using
an ordinary camera take place. The
new x-ray machine is compact, easy to
operate, self-contained, and requires no
special power source to operate.
In taking an ordinary radiograph or
x-ray, the time of exposure is depend-
ent on the strength of the x-ray beam,
which depends on the current passing
through the x-ray tube. Normal expo-
sures range from several seconds to
minutes in duration and use several
thousandths of an ampere. To obtain
a satisfactory exposure at one millionth
of a second the current must be in-
creased one million times to some thou-
sands of amperes. Currents of such
strength cannot be obtained using a
heated tungsten filament.
The search for a new method of sup-
plying such a tremendous burst of cur-
rent led to investigation and finally
utilization of a weakness in high vacu-
um tubes — this weakness is called
''random discharge" and is just what
its name suggests. It was generally
concluded that when a tube failed to
withstand high voltages it was due to
an increase in the very low gas pressure
within that tube—"random discharge"
took place, which was the passage of a
large current, sometimes several am-
peres, in an arc. Actually, an increase
in gas pressure is usually not the cause,
for ''random discharge" takes place in
tubes where the pressure has decreased
with use. Physicists now recognize that
it is high electric fields at points other
than the cathode and especially sharp
corners and points inside the tube
which cause tube failure. Impurities
and occluded gases also lower the re-
sistance.
Recognizing that the pressure was
not responsible for "random dis-
charges," the possibility of increasing
them deliberately to a point where they
might serve some useful purpose pre-
sented itself. After considerable experi-
menting, Dr. Charles M. Slack and his
associates at Westinghouse developed
a three-electrode tube which performed
satisfactorily. Two of these electrodes
are the expected cathode and anode.
The third electrode is spaced close to
the cathode and is connected to the
anode through a high resistance. It
serves to initiate discharge from the
cathode and when the flow of electrons
has switched to the anode proper, due
to the high resistance offered by the
secondary anode, it focuses the flow of
electrons on the anode. By using this
method, currents of several thousand
amperes are obtained with dependabili-
ty-
A small rectangular piece of moly-
bdenum acts as the cathode. The aux-
iliary electrode is a trough - shaped
block with the sharpened edges of the
molybdenum cathode placed close to a
slot cut in its center. The target for
electron discharge is a rectangular slab
of tungsten, 1" x l\'-&gt;" x %". Tung-
sten is an excellent producer of x-rays,
has a high melting point, and conducts
heat well. The latter two properties
are necessary because of the intense
energy liberated in spite of the short
duration of the discharge. Vaporization
of the anode does take place to some
extent, although several thousand dis-
charges are possible before the deposits
on the glass become heavy enough to
cause failure of the tube.

X-ray study of vacuum cleaner action
Definition is not as fine with the
new tube as with the conventional type,
due to the area of the focal spot of the
discharge. For most cases, however, it
is satisfactory.
The current, which may reach 600,-
000 kilowatts, is generated by a surge
generator. The surge generator, built
to operate the high speed x-ray. is a
group of 7 large condensers, 6 to pro-
vide the main current and a 7th to
"trigger" the apparatus. The con-

Why some things get better all the time
The SPAN OF LIFE is increasing. Within the last half cen-
tury the average length of life of a new born infant has
increased over 30r/c. And many more people over 40 can
now expect to live well into their seventies.
Among the reasons for this progress, along with notable
advancements made by the medical profession, are the im-
provements in medicinals and medical equipment that help
guard life.
Synthetic organic chemicals now are used in the produc-
tion of a host of pharmaceuticals, including penicillin and
the sulfa drugs, which have accomplished wonders in the
fight against germs. They also are used in repellents to de-
feat disease-carrying insects. Out of research with gases has
come oxygen therapy, an aid to recovery in numerous ill-
nesses. Research with metals and alloys has produced the
gleaming, easy-to-clean stainless steel used in modern hos-
pital and medical equipment.
In safeguarding life—just as in transportation and com-
munications—much of man's progress is traceable to better
materials.
Producing better materials for the use of industry and
the benefit of mankind is the work of Union Carbide.
Basic knowledge and persistent research are required,
particularly in the fields of science and engineering. Work-
ing with extremes of heat and cold—frequently as high as
0000° or as low as 300° below zero, Fahrenheit—and with
vacuums and great pressures, Units of UCC now separate or
combine nearly one-half of the many elements of the earth.

densers are charged in parallel through
10,000 ohm resistances; these resist-
ances are high enough so that there is
little loss of energy in them during dis-
charge. Each of the six condensers has
a 50-kilovolt capacity, so that their
total voltage when discharging equals
300,000 volts. The condensers are sep-
arated by ''sphere gaps" which are ex-
actly what they appear to be—small
gaps between two metal spheres.
When the condensers have been fully
charged, an additional condenser is dis-
charged and provides an auxiliary po-
tential sufficient to break down one of
the sphere gaps. This throws a still
greater potential on the next sphere
gap which in turn breaks down and so
on along the whole line, discharging all
the condensers.
Several methods have been used to
set off the "triggering" condenser, such
as a bullet cutting a wire or a golf club
breaking a contact supplied by the golf
ball. The triggering unit is supplied
with varying electronic equipment, so
that any required delay can be inserted
to catch the desired phase of action.
One of the main uses of high speed
photographs taken with x-rays is in
ballistics. The equipment is used to
study shells striking and exploding,
shells in the gun barrel and in the air.
Ordinary photographs have met with
no success in picturing the reaction be-
tween armor plate and a bullet, be-
cause of luminous particles thrown out
at the time of impact.

Impact effect on golf balls
With high speed x-rays, it is possible
to study the motion and distortion of
the bullet in the gun barrel itself. Up
until the x-ray was used, it was im-
possible to tell the exact position of
the bullet in relation to the muzzle
blast. Pictures of a 20 mm., high ex-
plosive shell had to be taken through
a '/4-inch thick steel armor plate. De-
spite this, they were very clear. One
of the amazing things about the ex-
plosion was the fact that the shell
swelled to twice its' normal size before
it burst.
Another set of x-rays showed why
certain armor-piercing bullets failed to
penetrate armor. Major J. C. Clark of
the Ballistic Research Laboratory at
Aberdeen, Maryland, found that the
armor-piercing cap of the bullet broke
loose from the rest of the bullet on
leaving the gun barrel.

Ballistics studied by x-ray
"Spark gap" pictures are taken by
removing the x-ray tube and substitut-
ing a spark gap. This provides a high-
speed flash which can be used for con-
ventional photography. Perhaps this is
wandering a little afield, but if we cut
down the voltage of the x-ray to about
3,500 volts, put this smaller edition in
a battery-operated case that weighs 12
to 20 pounds, and substitute a xenon
gas-filled tube between two plain elec-
trodes, we have the newly developed
electronic flash gun, used on press-type
cameras. A slightly larger edition, op-
erating on house current, provides stu-
dio lights that, since they operate at
full intensity for only 1/2000 to
1/5000 of a second, do not drown the
model in her own perspiration.
Many applications of the x-ray exist.
A suitable application requires: (1) a
desire to study parts in motion, (2)
impractability of high-speed light-pho-
tography. Turbine deformation, valve
action in reciprocating engines, refrig-
eration and compression machinery and
the previously mentioned field of bal-
listics seem to present the choicest
fields of exploration and research.

If you made a guess, here's how close to being right you were. Of the six
mentioned industries, the oil industry ranks first in formalized pension plans,
group life insurance coverage, paid vacations for salaried employees and paid
holidays for hourly employees. The industry places second in paid vacations
for hourly employees and paid holidays for salaried workers.
The more you know about the oil business, the more you realize that
petroleum is one of the progressive industries.
Employee benefit plans have been in force at Standard Oil of Indiana for many
years. They are under continuous study with an eye to improving them—
and to keeping them well abreast of changing social and economic conditions.
At the start of 1947, our Vacation Plan was again revised. Under the new
provisions all 15-year employees will have three weeks' vacation every year,
and all 25-year employees will have four weeks—and the vacation policy has
undergone several other liberalizing changes. Recently, too, we put into
effect a new liberal Group Life Insurance Plan for employees. A new Death
Benefits Plan for annuitants will increase considerably the payments made
to dependents.
An employee who faces the future with confidence is a loyal and efficient
employee. To give our employees that confidence, we endeavor to supply all
proper safeguards of an enlightened social economy. At the same time, we
provide the incentive of advancement through accomplishment—which is
the keystone of the system of free enterprise.

the Gier's back porch.
At the age of six, Ted moved with
his family to the more populous area of
Albany, New York, where he eventually
entered the Albany Academy prep
school with a scholarship. Proving the
value of his youthful cramming, he
graduated cum laude in 1941 as valedic-
torian of his class.
An early interest in the sciences
which, incidentally, resulted in a few
major explosions in the Academy chem-
istry lab — "having a heck of a good
time," to quote—decided him in favor
of the apparently exciting pursuit of
further chemical knowledge. His choice
of schools included three of top rank
and required, according to Ted, a dis-
tance elimination of the following se-
quence: MIT, too close; Cal Tech, too
far; Michigan, just right.
Here at the University, Ted's scho-
lastic achievements were again recog-
nized and he was pledged to Phi Eta
Sigma during his freshman year. The
fall of '42 also found Ted organizing
his own dance band, with himself pump-
ing hot air out of a tenor sax for cam-
pus frats and sororities.
THE TECHNIC PRESENTS
(Continued from page 16)
Spring of 1943 brought Ted into the
Chi Phi's for a short lived association
with his brothers. About this time his
draft board snapped out of its gracious
confusion as to the status difference be-
tween basic and advanced ROTC,
whereupon Ted promptly threw in his
voluntary "I will'' before the Army's
''you said it" came through.
Uncle Sam, however, considered Ted
to be up among its most favored brain
children, and he was promptly shipped
to Texas A &amp; M, ASTP unit, where
he graduated as an electrical engineer
(Army equivalent) after twelve months
of study. Experimental work on
ANTRC radio broadcasting units kept
him busy at his next post, Camp Crow-
der, until the after effects of a case of
rheumatic fever required medical dis-
charge early in 1945.
A few months after his discharge
found Ted exploring the quick-sands
of matrimony with the former Mickey
Baldwin.
On their return to Ann Arbor in June,
1945, the newly-wed Giers located one
of those scarce items known as an apart-
ment, thus permitting Ted to continue
his interrupted education. Remarkable
abilities enabled him to accomplish the
extra-curricular impossibilities that most
of us dream about between semesters.
One of the "wheels" in the 1945 re-
organization of Michigan's student
chapter of A.I.Ch. E., Ted took the vice-
president's chair last semester, in addi-
tion to the job of Features Editor for
the TECHNIC. He was one of six en-
gineers elected to Sigma Xi last spring
and is a Tau Bate and Phi Lambda Up-
silon as well. At last report he was still
riding the crest of a 3.5 average.
Divided interest, at present, centers
technically in work with Prof. J.T.
BanChEro on his odoriferous Dow-
therm research.
Just one hobby gets attention—radio.
When time and cash permit, he will no
doubt be bothering the rest of the hams
with sixteen cylinder dit-dahs from his
all too extensive vocabulary.
For the future—work with silicones
(see the November, '46, TECHNIC)
and other plastics, he hopes, with one
of the larger chemical corporations.
Graduation in June—a few years prac-
tical experience—and then back to the
Alma Mater for his master's degree in
Chemical Engineering.

The Frustrated Engineer
"Education is not the learning

developing of the intellect and the
broadening of the mind afforded
by a general knowledge of all sub-
jects of interest to the human
race." ■ p
Dr. Charles P. Steinmetz,
electrical engineering genius
"The American brain is the
least used muscle of the anatomy.
When it comes to cultural en-
deavor, our education has been a
lamentable and conspicuous fail-
ure. The average college graduate
has lain on the beach but refused
to be sunburned."
John Mason Brown,
noted drama and art critic
Many people who associate with
engineers, many practicing engineers
themselves, and many engineering
students feel that an American Engi-
neering education is not the educa-
tion of a professional man. They
feel that engineering does not deserve
to be classified as a profession be-
cause the education which leads to an
engineering degree is not a "profes-
sional" education; the student's de-
sire for a wide general background
for his technical studies has been
completely frustrated.
The traditionally professional edu-
cation is that which prepares the col-
lege graduate to practice in such
fields as Medicine and Law. In ad-
dition to complete mastery of the
technical details of these professions,
the students are required to master
a "general" college education before
they even begin their professional
study. Engineering students, on the
other hand, are plunged directly into
an intensive technical program of
mathematics, physics, and chemistry,
and before they can catch their
breath, they have chosen a field of
specialization, become more or less
proficient in it, and have been handed
diplomas. They are skilled tech-
nicians, and nothing more. To quote
Steinmetz again:
"Specialists ... are tools, useful
when directed by somebody's in-
telligence, but useless to them-
selves and to the world otherwise.
The product of many of our engi-
neering schools ... is of this char-
acter."
It is universally agreed that a gen-
eral education has three principal
subdivisions:
A. Background
B. General Information
C. Technical or Professional Spec-
ialty
The creation of. a suitable back-
ground proceeds normally over the
full course of our lives, and neither
begins nor ends with our "college"
education. But we are forced to ac-
quire both our fund of general in-
formation and our technical specialty
while in college, and it is this gen-
eral information which the average
engineering student so sadly lacks.
To the best of the engineering stu-
dent's knowledge, Voltaire was the
inventor of the Voltaic Cell. He is
ignorant of the styles of Hemingway
and Maugham, and is unable either
to discuss such things or to enjoy
them. Not only is the student limited
in his conversational ability, but he
is also deprived of that richer fund
of "experience" to be found in litera-
ture. Thus he has no awareness of
values, no sense of proportion, by
which he 'can view the importance
of his engineering work in a clear,
realistic light.
This lack of acquaintance with
fields of human accomplishment oflt-
side of engineering can sometimes be
remedied by the student; but if left
to him, it often goes unchanged. The
responsibility for widening the scope
of the American engineering curricu-
lum must be accepted by the engi-
neering colleges; they must take it
upon themselves to so change the
programs offered that their gradu-
ates will be professional college men,
and not just skilled technicians. The
Society for the Promotion of Engi-
neering Education has stated the
solution thus:
"Undergraduate curricula should
be made broader and more funda-
mental through increased empha-
sis on basic sciences and humanis-
tic and social studies. This will
require greater efficiency in the use
of the student's time to be gained
by pruning to the essentials of a
sound educational program."
This pruning of the engineering
curriculum is the answer to the engi-
neer's frustration. If his general
knowledge can be increased while he
is in college, he can avoid the fate of
the narrow technician, and can be-
come a well-rounded professional
man. He will be ready to shoulder
his technical responsibilities, and
also understand and aid the progress
of society toward a better, more civi-
lized mode of living.
If the engineering curriculum can
be broadened by eliminating some of
the advanced, specialized courses,
and by substituting for them widely
useful "humanistic courses" in phi-
losophy, psychology, literature, and
history, the engineering graduate will
not be so well prepared for his in-
dustrial or business job as before. Or
will he? Graduates from our pres-
ent programs find that every large
industrial organization insists that
they enter a "Company Training
Program" in which they are taught
the details of the work to be done.
This may completely duplicate the
advanced course work which they
took while in college. If engineering
graduates were given bachelor's de-
grees in "General Engineering," with
all the basic scientific course work
plus a wide humanistic background
instead of technical specialization,
they would be equally well prepared
for their work in industry, and much
better prepared for life.

Metallurgical Engineering
Metallurgical Engineering may
be roughly divided into two
broad and rather distinct fields.
111 The extraction of metals
from their ores, the production
of alloys and the shaping proc-
esses for both. (2) The devel-
opment and control of desired
physical properties by various
chemical, thermal and mechani-
cal treatments. This latter field
is called Physical Metallurgy.
In extractive metallurgy the
various steps proceed by unit
operations identical with those
used in Chemical Engineering,
with more emphasis placed up-
on handling and separation of
solids, and operations in melt-
ing furnaces. Knowledge must
be acquired of obtaining and
controlling the extreme tem-
peratures required to melt re-
fractory metals and alloys. In
physical metallurgy the prop-
erties of metals and alloys must
be studied from the viewpoint
of their inner structure as re-
vealed by the metallographer's
microscope, X-rays and other means, and processes of heat treatment and mechanical working must be adapted to yield
structures and surface conditions which have been shown ta b: most desirable in the finished product. The Metallurgical
Engineer therefore finds his place not only in the industries involved directly in the production of metals and metal prod-
ucts; but also to an ever-increasing extent in the industries dependent for their existence on metals and metal products.
Diminishing supplies of high grade ores and an increasing demand for new alloys of superior qualities make this whole field
cne of ever-growing importance.

.. a great name in research with a big future in CHEMISTRY
ATOMIC ENERGY
Power for Tomorrow's World
Will nuclear energy drive an automo-
bile indefinitely from a tiny teacup
power plant? Will it melt the icecap on
Greenland?
These fantastic projects, and others
more bizarre, have been publicly ad-
vanced as examples of what we may ex-
pect from harnessed atomic power. The
fact is. such accomplishments are fraught
with endless complications and are not
possible in the light of anything we
know today.

* THE ATOM IN INDUSTRY
But one thing is certain. Atomic energy
does offer tremendous peacetime poten-
tialities. Sober men of science, not given
to heedless predictions, are suggesting
applications of nuclear forces to indus-
try that five or six years ago would have
startled even readers of "Amazing
Stories."
What is General Electric doing about
atomic energy? For many years, experi-
ments and development work in nucle-
onics have been carried on by the
General Electric Research Laboratory.
It was in 1940 that two G-E scientists.
Dr. Kenneth H. Kingdon and Dr. Her-
bert C. Pollack, successfully isolated the
U-235 isotope of uranium from the com-
mercial uranium metal. Other outstand-
ing contributions to atomic progress
have been made since then by G-E scien-
tists, and General Electric facilities for
nucleonic research have been greatly
expanded.
ATOMIC POWER PLANTS?

What sort of immediate developments
may be expected from the taming of the
atom? G-E Vice President Harry A.
Winne. in charge ol engineering policy
lor the Company, had some comments
on that when he took part in a radio
forum program on the subject. "What
Can Atomic Energy Do for the World?"
Mr. Winne pointed out that for the
foreseeable future atomic energy will
not replace, but rather.will.supplement,
other sources of energy. 1 le believes that
the first small, experimental atomic
power plants may be operating within
three or tour years. But larger plants
introduce new problems. "So in my
opinion." says Mr. Winne, "we are not
suddenly going to find atomic power
plants springing up all over the country!'
Exactly what specific achievements
nuclear energy will make possible and
when it will produce them remains con-
jectural, of course. However, the key
which will continue to unlock the deep-
est secrets of the atom is research. And
General Electric's research and devel-
opment program is already geared to in-
vestigate fully this fascinating new field.
G. E.-A GREAT NAME
IN CHEMISTRY

One phase of this broad-nuclear research
program is chemical research being con-
cluded by General Electric. Research in
other fields of chemistry is also carried
on by General Electric and includes
work being clone in the fields of sili-
cones, plastics, synthetic resins, and in-
sulating materials. If you want more
information on any of these subjects,

cal Department, General Electric Com-
pany, Pittsfield, Mass.

A message to students of chemistry and chemical engineering from
DR. WILLIAM D. COOLIDGE
X-ray pioneer and former Director, General Electric Research
Laboratory.
To young chemists and engineers, no field holds more challenge
or offers more possibilities than that of atomic energy. This new
frontier of science is without parallel in the opportunities it pro-
vides for significant research.

Here's help
k in bridging
this gap
To help bridge the gap between college and in-
dustry, Westinghouse many years ago established
its Graduate Student Training Course. This plan
has provided practical training for more than 14,000
college graduates in its more than 50 years of
operation.
Through basic training in industrial methods
and organization, plus practical work, assignments
to prepare the way for future specialization, the
course equips graduates to find their most effective
place in the Westinghouse organization.
A new booklet, Finding Your Place in Industry,
describes this course in detail. It also contains
many helpful suggestions on choosing the right

plastic bearings
Unique experiments with transparent
plastic models of machine bearings are
revealing "inside information" that may
result in more powerful motors for the
nation's factories.
One peek at these plastic models in
operation often is better than weeks of
mathematical calculations. Guess-work
is eliminated. Now engineers can see
what is happening and can design bear-
ings which will handle a heavier load
and help make possible more powerful
motors without any increase in size or
weight.
The procedure is simple. Oil, colored
with a red pigment, is fed into the bear-
ing model and the lubrication effective-
ness quickly is apparent. Engineers
know at once whether the seals work
properly, whether the oil passages are
enabling a proper flow of the lubricant
and whether the relief points are cor-
rectly located. Previously, all this had
to be determined very largely by trial
and error.

Lucite bearing.
Blocks of lucite, a transparent plas-
tic, are machined to close tolerances just
like metal to form the models of bear-
ings and journals. During the actual
operating tests, the rotating element of
the finished model is operated by a hand
crank for slow speeds and is motor-
driven for high speeds.
As the red-colored oil works its way
through the bearings, engineers can see
whether the grooves which distribute the
oil are properly placed to do a thorough
job. If these oil passages are not in the
right positions, some of the areas will
be "starved" for oil and the bearing can-
not carry a full load. This, in turn, re-
duces that amount of work which the
motor can handle.
After watching the transparent models
in action, the engineers can redesign the
bearing so that thorough lubrication is
assured. This enables the entire length
of the bearing to shoulder the burden
and the motor can do a bigger job.
automatic flight recorder
Development of an automatic flight
recorder, designed to provide recorded
data which will help determine the cause
of airline mishaps has been announced
recently.
The new instrument also provides air-
lines with easily-read records of a
plane's altitude, vertical acceleration,
airspeed, compass-heading, and other
operational data which can be measured
with standard aircraft instruments.
Any of the standard aircraft instru-
ments of the pointer-indicating type
can be used with the new recorder,
engineers said, explaining that the new
instruments promotes safety and effi-
ciency in the air by detecting possible
dangerous airplane or pilot tendencies
before they lead to accidents, and by
furnishing recorded data which may-
later determine the cause of an acci-
dent to the plane.
high-vacuum creator
High speed pumps which may prove
valuable for good dehydration, plasma
process, and other products were a
major factor in building the atomic
bomb. More perfect vacuums created
more swiftly and in greater quantity
then ever before were used during the
electromagnetic separation of uranium.
Vacuums such as these were needed
to permit electron and ion activity in
some of the separation machines much
as vacuums are used to allow such ac-
tivity in electronic tubes. The giant-
sized pumps created vacuums in Calu-
trons, the electrical "atom sorters"
which separated U-23S from the two
other Uranium isotopes in the electro-
magnet separation process. The Army's
official report on atomic energy says
that this method resulted in large scale
production of U-235.
The oil in the diffusion pumps is
heated electrically in a "vat" in the
bottom of the pump. The vapor shoots
upward through a chimney-like sleeve
and streams out through jets that are
angled sharply downward. Oil mole-
cules are hurled at approximately the
speed of sound—750 miles per hour—
from the three jets of the largest pump.
These oil molecules entrap the air mole-
cules from the container being evacu-
ated, and shoot them downward into
the eight-inch oil diffusion pump, from
which they are exhausted into the at-
mosphere. After an oil molecule has
given a molecule of air a shove into the
pump, it strikes the water-cooled wall
of the pump and flows back to the start-
ing point where the cycle is repeated.

Courtesy Westinghouse
High-vacuum pump
The cycle is repeated until the pres-
sure in the largest pump is only two-
hundred millionths of a pound per
square inch. At full operating pressure,
the giant pump can create a 99.999999
percent perfect vacuum faster than any
other pump ever built.
The largest of these three pumps used
with the Calutrons has the toughest job,
for it operates at the lowest pressure.
Air molecules usually move about at
random and at the low pressure in the
great pump they can move on the aver-
age 250 inches in any direction before
colliding with another air molecule. At
atmospheric pressure, however, they can
move only four millionths of an inch
without colliding. Thus, in this large
pump, it is very difficult for the oil mole-
cules to drag air molecules out with
them.

test tube!
You have heard much about petroleum
reserves and their vital importance to
America's future. It is good to know that
reserves already discovered are ample for
many years to come and that explorations
can be relied upon to find great
new reservoirs under ground.
It is good to know, too, that petroleum
chemists and engineers have been taking
a long-range view of the future in motor
fuels, have been seeking a new source, and
have developed a method of using it.
A "gusher" out of a test tube!
The new source is natural gas. And the
new method is the Synthol process.
This will utilize America's vast reserves of
natural gas—will turn gas into gasoline . . .
at a cost-per-gallon comparable to that of
gasoline made from crude oil. In the
development of this process, the Standard Oil
Company (Indiana), through its subsidiary, the
Stanolind Oil and Gas Company, is
playing a leading role.
Fundamentally, the Synthol process uses
oxygen to convert natural gas to a mixture of
carbon monoxide and hydrogen. The carbon
monoxide and hydrogen, passing over a catalyst,
react to produce hydrocarbons in the gasoline
and distillate fuel range, plus oxygenated
compounds which have uses as chemicals.
And now, after intensive research—
exploratory, pilot plant, process design,
engineering—the Stanolind Oil and Gas Company
is planning a full-size Synthol plant designed
to convert natural gas into 6,000 barrels
a day of high quality gasoline.
Here is applied science indeed! And—what's
more—a modification of the Synthol process
would produce liquid fuels from our tremendous
reserves of coal . . . fuel enough for a thousand
years and more. So there's big-league research
ahead . . . research devoted to producing power
from every possible source. And the scientists of
Standard of Indiana will be right in the thick of it.

Editor's Note
In recent years it has become increas-
ingly apparent that the problems of so-
ciety are no longer the problems of
select groups of men particularly con-
cerned with them but are in reality the
problems of all educated men every-
where. It has also become apparent
that modern technology, with its un-
expected placing of new power and new
responsibility in the hands of mankind,
has contributed very materially to the
deep and far-reaching effects of these
problems; so much so that the trained
technologist can no longer ignore the re-
sponsibility that befalls him, as the con-
tributor of this power, for the finding of
solutions to modern social and ethical
problems. For this reason the Technic
has purposed to inaugurate a new fea-
ture, with the view in mind of bring-
ing before the Engineering student body
of the University, through the reviewing
of recent articles and books, the prob-
lems that have arisen in the wake of
modern technological advances, and the
solutions that have been suggested for
them. It is the Technic's hope that
these ideas will (in some small way)
stimulate a lasting interest in the avoca-
tional perusal of the literature which
relates engineering and science to our
modern society and in so doing will en-
able the future engineering graduate to
orient himself more intelligently to his
new responsibilities.
* * *
The decision of the Technic staff to
devote a portion of each issue to book
reviews and discussions of subjects out-
side the engineering field marks a note-
worthy forward step in the development
of the magazine. It is most important
that all students very early in their
careers form the habit of devoting some
time to the reading of such subjects and
thus lay t^ie foundations for a general
education.
General education is a process which
starts with birth and continues all
through life. In grade school, time is
devoted to the acquisition of the neces-
sary tools,—reading, writing and arith-
metic. The high school period places
more tools in his hands,—he is intro-
duced to physical and social science, also

Ivan C. Crawford
to literature and foreign language. Dur-
ing these periods the atmosphere of the
home also exerts a powerful influence on
the student's intellectual interests.
At the university the engineering stu-
dent finds his working day fully oc-
cupied with mathematics, science, and
related subjects. As he progresses to-
ward graduation the emphasis on engi-
neering science and professional subjects
becomes pronounced. Time is allotted,
however, to required courses in eco-
nomics and English, and non-technical
electives. These studies, it is expected,
will create a desire to continue reading
and consequently extend his education
after leaving college.
A properly directed reading habit is
the secret of securing a general educa-
tion regardless of whether the person be
engaged in a professional calling or
some other activity. Unless the years in
college have developed this habit, or
strengthened it in case one was already
present, it must be acquired in later
years if the individual is to reach the
desired goal. A college degree, bachelor
of arts or bachelor of science, does not
guarantee that the recipient has ac-
quired the ability to continue the educa-
tional process under his own power. The
truth of this statement may be easily
checked by observing the reading habits
of graduates who have been away from
college for some five to ten years.
What should one read to secure a gen-
eral education? Authorities will differ
on this question just as they do on what
constitutes a "liberal" education. All
would agree that every one should be
rather thoroughly informed about our
national origin and the sources from
which it developed. The history of our
development as a nation must be con-
sidered in the light of world conditions
if we are to arrive at a proper under-
standing of its significance.
One cannot be considered educated
unless he possesses an acquaintance with
literature. The introduction to English
literature is offered in the high school
curriculum. For the engineer a very
limited opportunity to continue this
study presents itself in college years,
that is, so far as the engineering curricu-
lum is concerned. Every student may,
if he so desires, extend this fascinating
study by devoting a portion of his free
time to reading a carefully selected list
of books. Such reading should not be
considered additional work but rather
a profitable and enjoyable utilization of
leisure time. While conceding that Eng-
lish literature occupies a place of pri-
mary importance we must remember
that translations from the literature of
foreign countries are necessary to com-
plement this study. Of course, it would
be much better if the student could
read such works in the original language
but this will be impossible for the vast
majority.
The world of to-day appears to be
divided into two camps, each founded
upon a different system of national
economy. A thorough understanding of
these systems is certainly a requirement
for one claiming a general education.
One can hardly become familiar with
the various periods of history without a
somewhat detailed knowledge of the
leaders of those times. For this reason,
familiarity with a selected list of biogra-
phies is recommended. Also, when pre-
sented in this form history is generally
more interesting than the mere perusal
of texts on the subject.
Too much emphasis cannot be laid on
the fact that the acquirement of a gen-
eral education is matter within the con-
trol of the individual. It depends upon
his ability to plan and read continuously
under his own direction.

KARL HENION, '48. E
Much discussion today is being de-
voted to the problem of how to broaden
the intellectual capacities of the engi-
neering student, especially in those
fields of learning which he has had little
time to cultivate under his present col-
lege program.
The student engineer must concern
himself during his collegiate sojourn
with as many phases of college life that
he possibly can. Not only is the engi-
neer going to college for acquisition of
technical knowledge but he is also pre-
paring for the future and his success is
going to be a function of a lot more
than just his technical skill.
The ability to speak intelligently and
convincingly to his superiors, associates,
and a skill of putting over a point with
tactfulness while dealing with others
play no minor roles in the professional
engineer's success. Greater opportuni-
ties for self-improvement in speaking
should be afforded the engineer. The im-
portance of speech to the engineer
should be emphasized in our colleges as
much and as often as the physicist
emphasizes his "units."
The average engineer's writing abili-
ty is not very good. Yet the professional
engineer continually finds himself en-
gaged in writing of some form or other.
The time for improving one's writing is
right here at college.
So far, two important attributes of
any good professional man have been
mentioned. Many more exist, but by
far the most powerful and greatest of
all is the art of human relations. Few
men, very few indeed, have ever lived
who have earned the designation of
greatness without having had an im-
plicit talent for handling people. Leader-
ship is a most essential quality. Most
professional men, by virtue of the re-
sponsibilities they assume, are poten-
tially in the so-called leader-class of
society. When they get out on the job
they will find people working under
them. To understand and to know how
to deal with his subordinates so as to
obtain their confidence and admiration
are qualities the engineer must con-
tinually strive to develop.

Karl Henion
The successful engineer could very
well be likened to a boy's kite. The
technical know-how of an engineer is
represented by the body of the kite.
However, how high do you think the
kite would fly without its tail? In this
metaphor, the tail is nothing less than
those essential qualities of human rela-
tions, good speech, good writing, and
all of the other attributes, causing the
kite to maintain a straight and steady
course.
Any educational program for engi-
neers should be such that it gives the
student the maximum opportunity of
acquiring not only a technical training
but also affords him with a means for
broadening his capacities in different
fields. The best way to achieve this
goal is through a more intimate contact
between the faculty adviser and the stu-
dent and, mainly, through an extension
of the present four-year engineering pro-
gram. In this way, a student will have
more time for the study of important
non-technical subjects. It is not meant
to imply here that anybody exposing
himself to a wide variety of non-tech-
nical courses is, necessarily, going to be-
come a well-rounded individual. Some
of the dullest people come out of our
literary schools, and some of the keenest
and most versatile of minds are prod-
ucts of the engineering colleges. Nev-
ertheless, the average engineering stu-
dent today has very little time for
mental grazing in new pastures, and,
consequently, his education is quite
narrowed.
One plan which has been suggested a"
a tangible approach to the solution of
the problem is the adoption by engineer-
ing colleges of six-year plan for its stu-
dents. At first glance, disapproval of
the idea is quite naturally expected. But
along with its inherent disadvantages
the plan has many fine points. One
scheme of the proposal is presented here.
Taking a cross section of the engi-
neering curriculae offered in colleges and
universities throughout the country, one
finds very few whose schedules devote
as much as 21 per-cent of their regular
four-year course to the study of non-
technical subjects. (Incidentally, Michi-
gan stands very high in this regard.)
But even this 21 per-cent is not enough.
It still does not open the door wide
enough so that the humanities and the
arts in sufficient quantities are allowed
to temper the technical engineering mind
with a better knowledge of other worlds,
of people, and of present political and
social questions of the day. These things
can be attained to a great extent
through the study of literature, history,
languages, the social sciences, philoso-
phy, and the like.
A much greater chance exists for ac-
quiring this knowledge if the college
student during his first four years is
allowed to take up courses whose tech-
nical and non-technical ratio are in the
porportion of about one to three, re-
spectively. The technical subjects to be
offered in these four years would be
general and common to all branches of
engineering; viz., two full years of math-
ematics (possibly one more semester, in
addition); one full year each of chem-
istry and physics; two full years of en-
gineering mechanics; engineering draw-
ing and descriptive geometry. Spread
out over a period of four years, these

GREAT LAKES CARGO CARRIER
DESIGN AND POWER
by
L A. BAIER, N. A.
Professor and Chairman, Department of Naval
Architecture and Marine Engineering at University of Michigan
From sail to steam and Diesel, for
three hundred years, commerce and
settlers have traversed the waters of
the Great Lakes, challenging the naval
architect and shipbuilder to meet and
solve ever-changing demands for effi-
cient transportation.
Since the ill-fated 60-foot "Griffen,"
built in 1679 at Cayugo Creek above
Niagara, carried La Salle to Green Bay
and was lost on the return trip loaded
with furs, the design of lake vessels has
reflected the physical limitations and
cargo characteristics found nowhere else
in the world. Large bodies of open
water, shoal connecting rivers, and locks
made necessary by the 350-feet differ-
ence in altitude between Ontario and
Superior, have directed the design and
proportions of the lake carrier widely
different from coastwise and ocean ves-
sels. In addition, available seasonal
depths in lower lake ports, increased or
decreased by prevailing winds, further
limit the loading drafts. Full time navi-
gation is ice-restricted, totaling 225 to
250 days in the year, except for the car
ferries operating continuously across
Lake Michigan, the Straits, and the
Detroit River.
The type of suitable carrier also has
changed with the supply and demand of
various cargoes as the upper lake wil-
derness was exploited and the lower lake
industries consolidated. Furs down-
bound, and supplies and immigrants up-
bound, were followed by ore and lum-
ber cargoes with coal returning.
Today, the principal cargoes are ore,
limestone, coal, grain, cement, and oil.
Pulp wood, automobile parts, steel and
scrap, new cars and trucks, dairy prod-
ucts, sand, railroad car ferries and pas-
senger service form important traffic
but require comparatively little tonnage.
With an approximate total gross regis-
tered tonnage of 3,145,492 operating on
the Great Lakes, the iron ore bulk
freighter accounts for 2,193,490 tons.
The distinctive outboard view of the
typical lake freighter is familiar to

L. A. Baier
many. About 600 feet in length with
narrow beam, the machinery is located
aft and pilot house forward, permitting
a clear length for cargo hatches amid-
ship. The nearest counterpart in sea-
going vessels is the bulk oil tanker.
Several factors have operated to stand-
ardize the modern lake design to a de-
gree seldom possible in other trades.
These will become evident in further
discussion.
1. General Design. Since cargoes are
bulk in nature, loading and unloading
port facilities were naturally designed to
take maximum advantage of this fea-
ture. Multiple ore chutes spaced on 12-
foot centers determine the location and
dimensions of hatches. Ease of shifting
the vessel under coal or stone loaders
also demands a continuous cargo space
unbroken by deck houses. Long holds
with widely spaced bulkheads, self
trimming and clear of stanchions, are
necessary. Low speeds permit efficient
forms with comparatively short entrance
and run, embodying long parallel middle
bodies and high block coefficients. The
after end carries the propelling ma-
chinery, bunkers, quarters for engine
room force and mess facilities. Forward
are the deck-crew quarters, windlass
space, guest rooms, and pilot house.
Single screw propelled, the majority of
the fleet is steam-driven and coal-burn-
ing.
Ore is a "deadweight" cargo, hence
requiring emphasis on buoyancy or dis-
placement and wasteful of internal ca-
pacity. Tank tops are high reducing the
cargo lift and minimizing excessive
stability. Ample room is available for
wing tanks, with inclined inboard sides,
for ballast when upbound light. The
old whaleback, or "pig", represented a
design to eliminate unused space, reduce
tonnage measurement, and in the case
of grain, reduce the shifting of the free
surface.
Coal and grain on the other hand, are
"cubic" cargoes, demanding space and
unable to take full advantage of the
ore carrier's displacement capacity or
draft. For this and other reasons, the
large ore carriers operate a considerable
proportion of their trips upbound light.
Short earning seasons with 4 to 5
months layup and low income freight
call for minimum capital investment.
With a maximum run in open water of
about 30 hours, and considerable time
spent in rivers, shoal waters, and ma-
neuvering, efficiency of the power plant
at reduced revolutions is of importance.
The economics of a new design ob-
viously require the maximum spread
between income per ton and cost per
ton-mile, or a return of the investment
in the shortest number of years. Since
depreciation is generally based on a life
of 40 to 50 years, many of the factors
are unforeseeable and assumptions are
not always realized. Size, displacement,
cubic capacity, speed and power, de-
pend on probable freight rates, choice
of trade, percentage of full use, improve-
ments in channels and port facilities.
An economical study made some years
ago at the University of Michigan still
is of interest. Since the ultimate dimen-
sions have now become fairly well

established, the designer's principal con-
cern today is in the proper choice of
speed and power. Recently, some con-
sideration is being given to diesel drive,
and the future may see something of the
same trend now in effect in the general
railroad systems, even where coal lands
are owned or served.
Over the past 10 years, the average
loading time in upper lake ports was 5
hours 22 minutes and in the lower lake
ports discharging, 9 hours 12 minutes.
During the same period, the fastest
loading time ran from 1 hour, to 2 hours
and 5 minutes, with 8068 tons per hour
as an average rate. Other loading marks
cover a cargo of 13877 short tons of
coal plus 369 tons of bunker coal in 4
hours and 30 minutes; 555,000 bushels
of wheat in 7 hours and 20 minutes;
7145 short tons of stone in 38 minutes.
Unloading records are likewise remark-
able. 11445 long tons of iron ore dis-
charged in 2 hours and 20 minutes;
9366 short tons of coal in 6 hours and
5 minutes; 451,382 bushels of wheat
in 15 hours. An interesting difference
between the design of ocean and lake
vessels is that in the latter field avail-
able cargo is only limited to the vessel's
capacity or channel restrictions.
2. Length. Experience has proven
the economic advantage of the large
vessel on the lakes. During periods of
business recession, the smaller boats
first are laid up, and it was during such
a depression that the self-unloader came
into popular use. Old ships with tank
tops due for renewal were converted
and found markets unavailable to the
bulk carrier. It is doubtful whether the
present length will be materially in-
creased in future designs. A six hun-
dred twenty foot keel length is about
the limit for convenient winding a ship
in certain slips and difficulties of ma-
neuvering, with delay time, in restricted
waters are exaggerated for vessels of ex-
cessive length. It is true that many of
the smaller boats still are profitable to
operate, mainly due to the fact that
their age has resulted in the original in-
vestment being written off through past
depreciation entires.
3. Beam. The maximum beam will
probably be limited for some years to
not more than 70 feet. The fixed op-
timum reach of the present loading and
unloading rigs make difficult the proper
trimming of the cargo in the holds for
greater beams.
4. Drajt. Present channel depths
and freeboard requirements restrict the
current draft to 24 feet downbound on
about 35 feet moulded depth of hull.
Load lines are established for all mer-
chant vessels on the Great Lakes of 150
gross tons or over in conformity with
the Coastwise Load Line Act, October
1935, amended June 20, 1936, and ef-
fective as to vessels of 4000 gross tons
and upwards, November 27, 1935, and
as to all other vessels subject thereto
August 27, 1936. These freeboard rules
limit many of the older vessels to drafts
of 22 feet or less and only the modern
design can take advantage of the now
available 24 foot operating draft. Free-
board, and hence draft, is assigned for
Winter (November 1 to April 15); In-
termediate (April 16 to May 15) (Sep-
tember 16 to October 31); and the
Summer season (May 16 to September
15). The reduction in draft for a ves-
sel of 24-foot Summer draft would be
about 24 inches during the Winter sea-
son and about 11 inches for the Inter-
mediate term. Freeboard is basically a
function of length and depth, with ad-
justments and allowances for shear,
beam cambeY, superstructures, adequate
longitudinal section modulus, and cer-
tain safety and structural details.
5. Strength. The standards of longi-
tudinal strength were first outlined by
Dr. Sadler and Professor Lindblad of
the University of Michigan in 1922.
The results are incorporated in the free-
board regulations covering required
longitudinal modulus, where I/y =
f dB.
I = moment of inertia of the mid-
ship section about its neutral axis, cal-
culated in way of openings but without
deduction for rivet holes.
y = distance from the neutral axis to
the strength deck beam at side.
d = draft at the Summer freeboard.
B = beam of ship.
f = a factor given in the rules as a
function of length, being equal to 15.30
feet for 600 feet. However, values of
f for existing vessels with various types
of framing average 10 to 30% greater
than the required factor for a 600-foot
ship.

The generation of ultra-high-fre-
quency oscillations with excellent stabil-
ity and efficiency has been a challenge to
engineers and physicists for the past two
decades. Years of experimentation and
careful analysis have resulted in the per-
fection of the resonant-cavity magne-
tron. Before considering the operational
details of the magnetron, it is desirable
to review briefly the peculiarities en-
countered when dealing with ultra-high
frequency circuits.
U.H.F. Characteristics—A compari-
sons between ultra-high frequency oscil-
lators and conventional broadcast band
oscillators will clearly and concisely
illustrate ultra-high frequency charac-
teristics. The requirements of any tuned
circuit are low ohmic resistance, small
eddy-current and dielectric losses, and
good stability and selectivity. The rela-
tionship between the frequency and the
coils and condensers of a given resonant
circuit is given by the equation:
F='
2 it VLC
where L is the inductance in henries,
and C is the capacitance in farads. In
order to increase the frequency, L and
C must be made proportionately smaller.
As a result, coils require fewer turns
and condensers require fewer plates. A
limit is reached, however, when the
coil becomes a single loop of wire and
the condenser consists of the capacitive
effect between a piece of wire and some
adjacent metallic conductor.
It is impossible to raise the frequency
by reducing the physical size of the
tube associated with the desired reso-
nant circuit. A decrease in the size of
the tube elements lowers the inter-elec-
trode capacity of the tube and thus re-
duces the effective capacity. Leads from
the tube elements are brought out di-
rectly through the glass envelope and
consequently reduce the effective induc-
tance.
Insulators at low frequencies become
partial conductors at high frequencies.
The substantial leakage current through
the insulators lowers the power output

Gerard H. Ciczewski
considerably. As a result, polysterene
and isolantite insulators become neces-
sary.
With the use of small condensers,
coils consisting of one or two turns,
miniature tubes with low inter-electrode
capacities and low lead inductance and
isolantite or polystyrene insulators, it
is possible to obtain good stability and
selectivity up to 200 megacycles per
second. Since the use of extremely small
coils and condensers needed to obtain
these high frequencies would not easily
be handled and would render insufficient
flexibility of operation, it becomes neces-
sary to find some type of tuning circuit
that is sufficiently large to handle and at
the same time, possesses the necessary
characteristics of an efficient high fre-
quency oscillator.
As the frequency is raised above 200
megacycles the selectivity (ratio of in-
ductive reactance to resistance) of a
tuned circuit becomes very low and re-
sults in weak power output and fre-
quency instability. By using a system
of parallel wires or metallic tubes
equipped with a shorting bar, it is possi-
ble to obtain frequencies up to 600
megacycles. Such an arrangement is
commonly referred to as a Lecher wire
or a Lecher system. The resonant fre-
quency may be found by varying the
position of the shorting stub on the
Lecher line. Variation in the position of
the tuning stub changes the effective
length of the lines and thus changes the
frequency. An oscillator of this type re-
sembles more closely some portion of
a steam boiler rather than an intricate
electronic device. When the upper limit
of 600 megacycles is reached, power
output once again decreases and the
oscillator becomes unstable. The loss of
power is due to the transit time required
for an electron to traverse the distance
from the cathode to the plate through
the influential field of the grid, transit
time.
The concept of electron transit time
can be explained by the use of practical
examples. In the ordinary vacuum tube,
a certain time (depending on the tube
characteristics) is required for an elec-
tron to reach the plate. Suppose that
an electron requires 0.000,000,001 sec-
onds to pass from cathode to plate. This
infinitesimal period may be disregarded
when the frequency of the a.c. signal
is 10,000 cycles per second, for then one
complete cycle requires 0.0001 seconds.
However, the application of a 3000
megacycle signal produces an altogether
different effect. The 300 megacycle
signal requires 0.000,000,000,3 seconds
for one complete cycle. Thus, three
complete cycles will occur while the
electron is in the gap region between
the plate and cathode. This effect re-
sults in the lowering of the grid to cath-
ode impedance which in turn decreases
the power output and reduces the selec-
tivity of the circuit.
Transit time effects may be minimized
considerably by increasing the electron
velocity. This may be accomplished by
using higher plate voltages which will
attract the electrons with a much
greater force and thus increase the elec-
tron velocity. Since the electron now
has an increased velocity, it will strike
the plate with a greater force and result
in excessive heating of the plate. The
electrode spacings of the tube may be
reduced and in this manner diminish
the transit time. With the tube ele-
ments closely spaced, less heat will be
dissipated and the amplification factor
12

lem now becomes one of heat transfer.
Since no practical and satisfactory
means of plate heat dissipation has been
developed a new method of high fre-
quency generation became essential.
Construction Details
of Magnetron
Before considering the operation of
the resonant-cavity magnetron, it is de-
sirable to picture clearly the construc-
tional details. The magnetron is a
transmitter in itself capable of generat-
ing continuous oscillations as well as
pulses. Because of its ability to generate
tremendous pulse power, it is primarily
used in pulse circuit applications. The
complete magnetron excluding power
supplies, keyers, and associated mag-
netic circuits is contained within a single
vacuum tube. The anode is usually
machined from a solid block of copper
to which are attached cooling fins to
dissipate the excess heat. In the anode
block, several cavities are dispersed
symmetrically about the periphery. The
frequency and desired power output de-
termine the number of cavities. The
metal portion between the cavities is
called the vane. Power is taken from
the magnetron by injecting a coupling
loop (usually made of tungsten) into
one of the resonant cavities. Suspended
coaxially within the anode is the oxide-
coated, indirectly heated, cylindrical
cathode. The input power, usually in
the form of accurately timed pulses of
0.1 to 2.5 microseconds in duration, is
applied between the plate and cathode.
The only glass in these tubes is the in-
sulation for the output and filament
leads. A glass of low level r.f. loss is
required for this purpose. The seal be-
tween the leads and the glass is made
of kovar metal because it has the same
coefficient of expansion as the glass and
thus prevents cracking.
The use of resonant cavities became
necessary when the Lecher lines became
small and difficult to handle. A quarter
wave line at a wave-length of 10 centi-
meters is only 2.5 centimeters long. As
can obviously be seen this type of line
would be very difficult to tune and
handle. At ultra-high frequencies Lecher
lines radiate considerable energy while
the radiation from the resonant cavity
is negligible.
The Effect of Magnetic
Fields on Electron
If an electron is placed under the
influence of a magnetic field and its
line of travel is parallel to the lines of
flux of the magnetic field no force what-
soever will be exerted on the electron.
If the electron tube travels at some
angle into the magnetic field, it will be
acted upon. Consider the case of an
electron entering a magnetic field at
right angles. The magnetic force will
tend to curve the path of the electron.
If the entire medium in which the elec-
tron travels is under the influence of

A three centimeter magnetron.
the magnetic field the electron will de-
scribe a circular path. Since the angular
velocity and the time required to make
a complete rotation are independent
of the radius and the speed, it follows
that all the electrons admitted into a
magnetic field will describe circles of
various radii in the same period of time.
In the magnetron, the magnetic and
electric fields are at right angles. The
electric field exists between the plate and
the cathode. The magnetic field is
parallel to the axis of the plate and is
thus at right angles to the electric field.
An electron leaving the cathode will be
attracted by the d.c. potential existing
on the plate. However, the joint action
of the magnetic and electric fields forces
the electron to travel in a circular pat-
tern. This pattern is determined by the
strength of the magnetic field. The
greater the flux density becomes, the
smaller the arc. When the magnetic
field has increased sufficiently to pro-
hibit the electrons from reaching the
plate, plate current will immediately
cease to flow. It is at this point of cut-
off that the magnetron becomes useful
as a generator of ultra-high frequencies.
Every resonant cavity may be con-
sidered as a simple resonant circuit
consisting of a condenser and a coil. At
one part of an a.c. cycle, the r.f. cur-
rent in the coil will create a magnetic
field; at the next quarter cycle, the
condenser will become fully charged and
an electric field will be established. The
radio-frequency magnetic field should
not be confused with the constant mag-
netic field applied externally. Magne-
trons are usually designed to operate
with r.f. patterns such that the adjacent
cavities have a phase difference of 180
electrical degrees. This system of oscil-
lation is commonly referred to as the
w mode, because of the existing rela-
tionship between 180° and it. Experi-
ence has shown that the ir mode gives
the best stability and efficiency. In
order to insure stable operation for the
7T mode and to eliminate all other modes,
alternate vanes are electrically con-
nected by metallic rings. The capacitive
effect between the strapping rings de-
creases the frequency and thus develops
a greater variation in frequency between
the -it mode and any other mode.
A simple description of the electron
path in a resonant-cavity magnetron
may best be explained by unrolling the
anode and cathode in the manner shown
in Fig. 1. The anode and the cathode
form parallel planes; the magnetic field

is at right angles to the plane of the
paper and the d.c. electric field is repre-
sented by the vectors E. When an elec-
tron leaves the cathode, it will undergo
the changes previously described for an
electron under the influence of a mag-
netic and electric field. As the electron
moves from cathode to plate, it will in-

The student branch of the American
Institute of Chemical Engineers has
planned another full term of activities
for the Spring of 1947.
The first meeting took place on Feb-
ruary 20, when Mr. Watts A. Shelly,
Executive Secretary of the Michigan
State Board for Registration of Archi-
tects, Professional Engineers and Land
Surveyors discussed the licensing pro-
cedure for professional engineers in a
talk entitled "Chemical Engineers Need
Licenses, Too." He explained to the
group that they cannot become consult-
ing chemical engineers without first re-
ceiving their licenses from the State
Board.
The program of activities for the full
term was discussed at this meeting, and
five evening meetings were scheduled.
The next one, planned for March 13,
will feature a talk by Mr. S. L. Stark,
of the Personnel Department of Dow
Chemical Co. He will discuss executive
training for the Chemical Engineer. A
third meeting, scheduled for April 2.
will present Mr. H. R. Samis, Plant
Superintendent of Sharpies Chemical

The group hopes to make trips to the
plants of the U. S. Rubber Co., Wyan-
dotte Chemicals Corp., Socony-Vacuum

Open-House
The Engineering Open-House, an-
other campus tradition that suffered cur-
tailment during the war-years, will come
again to the Michigan campus this
Spring as the College of Engineering
throws open its doors to the public.

According to John Cox, chairman of
the 1947 Open-House Committee, the
date has been set for Friday, April 18.
The Slide-Rule Ball Committee has also
decided upon moving the dance to that
date, making it "one big Engineering
week-end." Dean Ivan C. Crawford, of
the Engineering College, has promised
that all classes in the College will be
excused for the day on Friday the 18th,
and as many Engineering students as
possible will be asked to help demon-
strate the many machines and pieces of
equipment in the Engineering Labor-
atories.
The student branch of the American
Society of Mechanical Engineers, for ex-
ample, is prepared to keep every steam-
engine, steam-turbine, water-wheel, and
pump in the Mechanical Engineering
Laboratories in operation during the
Open-House. It is hoped that the enor-
mous steam-consumption involved will
not be an excessive drain on the produc-
ing facilities of the University Power
House.
At the last pre-war Open-House, held
here in 1941, the various clubs and so-
cieties in the Engineering College as-
sumed responsibility for demonstrations
in the laboratories of each department.
The Electrical Engineering Laboratories
were opened, and in addition to showing
the power-producing equipment in oper-
ation, several very interesting demon-
strations of electrical phenomena were
given. The principles of radio, tele-
phone, and radar signals were shown,
and oscilloscope demonstrations showed
a "picture of sound." Artificial light-
ning and "black" or ultra-violet light
were made to do queer tricks.
The laboratories of the Engineering
Mechanics Department were opened,
and the flow of fluids in channels, and
past cylinders, and air-foil sections was
shown. The many testing machines in
the Materials Testing Laboratory gave
the visitors a concrete idea of what the
nebulous phrase "Tensile Strength" real-
ly means. The rainbow colors of photo-
elasticity tests were shown to bear def-
inite relationship to bending stress in
beams, as a changing load is applied.
The University Physics Department
arranged an impressive exhibit for the
last Open-House. The Cyclotron, the
Electron Microscope, Polarized light
filters, and bending of light rays (the
proof of Einstein's theory of relativity)
were demonstrated. In addition, the
paths of individual alpha-particles were
traced in a small Wilson Cloud Cham-
ber.
The Metal Processing Department
opened its foundry, and showed mold-
making, and pouring of the molten iron
from the cupola furnace. Automatic
electric and gas furnace, and the nitrid-
ing process of case-hardening were
tested. Electric-, gas-, and atomic-hy-
drogen welding demonstrations were
given, and a heavy duty oxygen-torch
cut through thick battleship steel armor-
plate. The machine shop operated its
many production machines. These have
now been replaced by completely mod-
ern machinery, driven electrically rather
than by the out-moded line shaft sys-
tem. It is hoped that the Machine Shop
will operate many of these new ma-
chines during the 1947 Open-House, to
give visitors a perspective on present-
day factory methods.
The Army and Navy R.O.T.C. units
contributed many displays to the 1941
Open-House, and the units are now
making plans to exhibit many new
pieces of military equipment. It is even
rumored that the Air Force R.O.T.C.
section will have a helicopter on hand.
The two items on the Open-House
menu which attract Ann Arbor students
are the Wind-Tunnel and the Naval
Tank demonstrations. Actual model
tests will be run in both cases, and visi-
tors will be carried on the Naval Tank's
moving test-platform down the full
length of the tank.
The Society of Women Engineers will
furnish beautiful guides to conduct the
visitors on charted tours throughout the
buildings of the Engineering Group. The
society will also manage information
booths in the Engineering Arch and
East Engineering lobby.
Several large Engineering class-rooms
will be given over to the showing of
moving pictures. Industrial firms have
promised to bring in many interesting
films, in addition to their practical dis-
plays, and R.O.T.C. units will show
battle films of wide public interest.

PRESENTS
roland
Roland W. Ure arrived in New York
during the spring of 1927 via the stork
route. At the age of two months, he
set out for Hawaii, taking along his
mother and his father — the latter
works with the boys' division of the
Y.M.C.A. When he was three, he re-
turned to South Bend, Ind., and finally,
after several years, his family settled
permanently in Worcester, Massachu-
setts.
By June of 1942, Roland decided
that his 3V2 years of high school work
was enough and tried to enter the U.
of M. that fall. But he lacked several
credits, and took some werk at Wor-
cester Polytechnic Institute instead.
Under the accelerated war-time pro-
gram, he completed the first term of
his Junior year, plus all his freshman
and sophomore work, in only twenty
months.

Roland W. Ure
In July, 1944, he received a letter
from President Roosevelt—this parted
him from Polytech but not from en-
gineering. He soon found himself in
Washington, D.C., at the Naval Ordi-
nance Laboratory, Navy Yard, as a
Specialist X. Here he spent a year
and a half working on the develop-
ment of accoustic mines. His release to
inactive duty in October, 1945, came
soon after the war ended—shortly after
this, he arrived at Michigan to com-
plete his work toward a physics degree.
In addition to his technical education,
Roland will have a considerable amount
of extra liberal arts credit on his tran-
script before he leaves Michigan, for
he believes that an engineer should
have a broader education than the
present engineering curriculum affords.
Besides being a Tau Bate, Roland is
president of Inter-Guild, a member of
the student A.I.E.E., a member of the
Ski Club, and has several hobbies—
radio, photograph, and camping. His
fraternity is Lambda Chi Alpha.
Inter-Guild is a Federation of Prot-
estant Student Groups on the Michi-
gan Campus. At Lane Hall, Roland
and his associates plan meetings be-
tween the various individual Guilds
about the campus, and integrate the
Ann Arbor groups with the national
and international Student Christian
movements.
Roland plans to enter the Graduate
School in the fall of 1947, upon his
graduation in June. Eventually, he
hopes to do research work in the ultra
high frequency radio field.
lenore
Catherine Lenore Olson, one of our
ultra-scarce feminine engineers, has
personality enough to melt the ice age
glacier, in spite of her northland heri-
tage of tall timber and snowbirds. Born
in 1926, the daughter of a Superior,
Wisconsin, druggist, Lenore (her pre-
ferred name) attended public school in
Superior through the sixth grade. About
1935 her father moved his business to
Escanaba in the Upper Peninsula of
Michigan, taking the family with him.
In addition to maintaining an excel-
lent scholastic record while attending
Escanaba High School, Lenore also en-
gaged in numerous outside activities.
Exceptional dramatic abilities were
demonstrated throughout her four years
of high school by her participation in
many plays and operettas and won for
her the feminine lead in the senior class
play. A moderate musical inclination
gained expression in the high school
choral union.
Lenore found speech work to be right
down her alley. As a junior she copped
the Upper Peninsula championship for
extemporaneous speaking, and through-
out the last three years of high school
she participated in debating, the team
earning second money in the U.P.'s west-
ern league during both her junior and
senior years.

Catherine Lenore Olson
While she was in high school, Lenore's
academic interests turned toward the
general sciences, chemistry, and physics,
and the study of these later proved to
be a valuable foundation for her engi-
neering work at the U. of M. With an
eye to the after-graduation days, she
pursued a general college preparatory
course.
After considerable coaxing by the
TECHNIC interviewer, Lenore dropped
her guard of modesty and admitted that
she was graduated as valedictorian of
Escanaba's June '43 class. She ex-
pressed the fear that people might think
she was one of the queer variety of ab-
normal who are all brain and nothing
else. Though publication standards will
not permit a bathing suit glamour shot
we can confidently state that Lenore,
judged by the highest standards of pul-
chritude, can be classified as a "beauty"
with brains and personality.
Following graduation, Lenore took a
state-wide competitive examination and
won a four-year scholarship to the Uni-
versity of Michigan. Entering the Col-
lege of Engineering in the fall of 1943,
she carried the usual basic engineering

The Synthesis of Nylon

Chemists ef original nylon research team honor memory of Dr. Carothers at the dedica-
tion. They are: J. W. Hill, Ph. D., M. I. T. '28; H. B. Dykttra, Ph. D. Ohio Stale '27; G. J.
Berchet, Ph. D. Colorado '29; J. E, Kirby, Ph. D. Iowa Stat* '29; E. W. Spanagel, Ph. D.
McGill '33; D. D. Coffman, Ph. D. Illinois '30; and F. J. Van Natta, Ph. D. Michigan '28.
Dr. Carothers received his Ph. D. from Illinois in 1924.
Recently the Nylon Research Labora-
tory near Wilmington was dedicated as
"The Carothers Research Laboratory,"
in honor of the late Wallace Hume
Carothers and his classical researches
on the structure of polymers, the mech-
anism of polymerization, and the in-
vention of nylon.
In 1928, a group of chemists under
Carothers began a study of polycon-
densation which led eventually to the
discovery of nylon. The project was
part of a program of fundamental re-
search to discover scientific facts which
might be of eventual value in laying a
foundation for applied research.
As the first point of attack, they chose
the condensation of dibasic acids with
glycols and reaction materials which
would preclude the formation of rings.
They obtained linear polymers of mo-
lecular weights between 2300 and 5000.
Molecular Weights Increased
After two years, a significant advance
in linear polymer preparation was
achieved. Through the use of the molec-
ular still, it was possible to obtain ma-
terials of molecular weights between
10,000 and 25,000, which, when molten,
could be drawn into filaments.
More important, the cooled super-
polyester filaments could be further
drawn into fibers several times their
original length and thereby acquired
luster, tensile strength, elasticity, plia-
bility, and toughness much greater than
the initial polymer. In contrast with
ordinary textile fibers, their tensile
strength was unchanged by wetting.
The striking properties of the fibers
aroused the hope of finding a commer-
cial fiber from some type of linear
superpolymer. Investigation showed,
however, that fibers from the polyesters
were too-low melting and too soluble
for textile purposes. Mixed polyester-
polyamides were also not of interest in
this category.
Research on Fibers
The possibility of a commercial fiber
development seemed remote, but the
intuition that frequently accompanies
research genius prevailed, and Carothers
was encouraged to direct his research
on superpolymers specifically toward
spinnable fibers. A polyamide from 9-
aminonanoic acid gave a fiber of 195°C.
melting point, equal in strength to silk,
and clearly indicated the possibility of
obtaining a material for fibers of com-
mercial utility.
In 1935, the superpolymer from hexa-
methylene diamine and adipic acid was
first synthesized. It melted at 263°C,
was insoluble in common solvents,

small measurements
When a person is purchasing apples,
for instance, his usual query to the
clerk is "How much?" The clerk's re-
ply perhaps is, "Fifty cents a dozen";
he then asks his customer, "How many,
please?"
The necessity of some sort of meas-
urement arose twice in this transaction.
Everyday man finds himself in some
manner or other constantly measuring
things. From the scientific standpoint,
the technician's hands would be tied if
measurement of his experiments and the
instruments for measurement were de-
nied him. The value of measuring is
the cornerstone of scientific progress.
Indeed, the great scientist, Lord Kel-
vin, realized the importance of measure-
ments when he said: "I often say that
when you can measure what you are
speaking about, and express it in num-
bers, you know something about it; but
when you cannot measure it, when you
cannot express it in numbers, your
knowledge is of a meagre and unsatis-
factory kind, it may be the beginning of
knowledge, but you have scarcely, in
your thought, advanced to the stage of
science, whatever the matter may be."
The General Electric Company has
produced scores of measuring instru-
ments. By furnishing us with these
measuring devices, this organization and
others like it are rendering a laudable
service to science. Several will be men-
tioned here.
The electric gage is a well-established
measuring device. It is very reliable and
will measure dimensions of small ma-
chine parts with high precision and
within close tolerances. Also, plating
gages for the measurement of steel coat-
ing thicknesses are available; they can
measure thicknesses in the range of
0.0001 inch to 0.01 inch. The aluminum
foil thickness gage can show a difference

Courtesy ASTM Bulletin
One of the latest derivatives from the photoelectric recorder is the yarn-
diameter recorder.
in foil thickness from a standard value
of 0.0001 inch. Whenever a displacement
can be produced for measurement of
force, pressure, or strain, the electric
gage can be used.
One of the earliest electrical measur-
ing devices was the photoelectric re-
corder, originally built to record tube
characteristics of radio receivers. This
instrument, operated today by photo
tubes, has many applications, among
which was its use in degaussing ships
during the war. Several important de-
rivatives have been evolved from this
recorder. One is the magnetometer
which measures values of magnetic
field as small as one milligram. The
yarn diameter recorder is another out-
growth of the photoelectric recorder;
yarn diameter of sizes from number 3
to number 24 can be measured at a yarn
speed of 72 inches per minute and re-
sults of 0.010 plus or minus 0.005 inch
are recorded.
The detection of impurities in a
gaseous mixture and the measurement
of these impurities constitutes a gas
analyzer. During the war, a request was
made for some instrument to measure
mercury-vapor concentration in certain
atmospheres where men were working.
The G. E. Research Lab helped develop
an instantaneous mercury-vapor detec-
tor for this purpose. Using an ultra-
violet lamp, the mercury vapor appears
in the lamp radiation as a black cloud,
thereby controlling the amount of ultra-
violet light reaching a phototube which
operates a physical recording network.
This instrument will measure in a few
seconds concentrations as low as 0.4
part of Hg in 100 million parts of air
by volume.
Every piece of electrical equipment
has a conductor in it, and this conductor
has to be supported; and the support
is an insulation. Consequently, the in-
sulation is of every conceivable shape
and size and consists of a wide variety
of materials—solid, liquid, and gaseous.
The degree of electrical insulation
offered by different insulating materials,
naturally, varies. The measurement of
this quality by a simple and direct
method has not yet been possible.
However, the insulative quality may be
evaluated by testing the properties of
the material. This is the best that can
be done at present.
Prominent in electric insulating test-
ing have been the bridges for the meas-
surement of power factor and capacities.

A simple Pratts-truss span,
And my fingers were held fixed-ended
In the clasp of my love—dear Ann.
And I sighed as I there surveyed her,
My love so passing fair.
While a sportive wind load sudden
Caused tensile stress in her hair.
"Ann, wilt thou walk beside me
Along Life's hard-surfaced road?''
On my ribs' spiral reinforcement
My heart set up an impact load.
"Oh, Ann, beam thou upon my life;
I pray thee do not dim it."
And my joy, when she softly whis-
pered "Yes"
Exceeded the elastic limit.
I had sworn to be a bachelor
She had sworn to be a bride
But I guess you know the answer
She had nature on her side.
Late to bed and early to rise
Makes a man saggy,
Draggy and baggy
Under the eyes.

a new voice

ALEXANDER GRAHAM BELL
byMoffett, 1918.
Alexander Graham Bell was a teacher of
the deaf. He was also a trained scientist who
made it possible for millions upon millions
of people to hear each other by telephone.
The telephone brought something into the
world that had not been there before.
For the first time people were able to talk
to each other even though separated by
long distances.
Horizons broadened. A new industry was
born, destined to employ hundreds of
thousands of men and women and be of
service to everyone in the land.
Alexander Graham Bell was a great human-
itarian, not only as a teacher of the deaf, but
in his vision of the benefits the telephone
could bring to mankind.
Bell's vision has come true. It keeps on
being an essential part of this nation-wide
public service.

courses would then be integrated with
the non-technical subjects.
As to the selection of non-technical
subjects, it should include numerous
courses in literature, not brief surveys
especially adapted for engineers but
those taught in the Literary College.
Sufficient training in speech and com-
position to insure a high proficiency in
these phases of English would also be
incorporated into the plan, the entire
English schedule to call for not less than
two and one-half years. A much more
thorough study of economics than what
a meager introductory course offers
would be required so that a more tangi-
ble mental hold on the subject could be
obtained. A course in accounting should
also be worked in. Proficiency in a
language would not be stipulated under
this scheme, but time would be allowed
those desirous of studying one. A cer-
tain amount of American and world his-
tory would definitely be required.
Many people have a sincere aversion to
history, it is true, but more than any
other subject offered in a university, his-
(Continued from page 9)
tory provides a man with a rich back-
ground in the origins and development
of the ideas and institutions which make
up his own life today. Courses in polit-
ical science, sociology, psychology, and
philosophy would be open to the stu-
dent. Under the heading of philosophy,
five or six credit-hours' work would be
very desirable; one course might include
the study of the works of some of the
great philosophers and another would
consist of a course in logic. Those en-
gineers who have elected philosophy
courses in the past have found them
very interesting and stimulating. In
general, this would constitute the scope
of the first four years.
After he had completed four years of
study the student would receive a
bachelor of science degree in General
Engineering; he would then enter a two-
year period of study where he would be-
gin specializing in one of the branches
of engineering. There the mechanical en-
gineering student would receive his
training in mechanical engineering sub-
jects; likewise, the electrical engineer,
the chemical engineer, etc. Two years
would be sufficient time for the student
to cover this phase of the plan, and
upon the successful completion of these
two years, the appropriate degree of
Mechanical Engineer or Chemical Engi-
neer would be awarded him.
Practically, the plan has a number of
drawbacks. First of all, in the way of
objections are the elements of time and
money. Some will not have the time
nor the money to extend their education
for two additional years. Another ob-
stacle to be overcome would be the
dislike some would have for the afore-
mentioned cultural subjects, their desire
being that of studying only engineering
while at college. No complete and satis-
fying answers to these particular ques-
tions can be offered except, perhaps, to
keep the present system and at the same
time introduce the six-year plan.
Without a doubt such a training as
the six year plan offers, if adopted wide-
ly throughout the country, would in
time raise the standards of the engineer-

Television today is clearer, sliarper, and brighter—thanks to the improved kineicopc, or picture tube, perfected at RCA Laboratories.
The Picture Tube that brought "life"to television
The screen on your home television
table model receiver is the face of a
large picture tube. And the skater you
see on the face of the tube is the iden-
tical- twin of the skater being televised.
Pioneering and research in RCA
Laboratories led to the development of
this tube which allows none of the orig-
inal realism to be "lost in transit." It
reproduces everything the television
camera sees, shows you every detail,
keeps the picture amazingly lifelike
and real.

a crane on the back end. You are going to take power from
the transmission to drive the crane drum. How would you do it?
THE SIMPLE SOLUTION-Use an S.S.White power drive
flexible shaft. Connect one end to a take-off on the trans-
mission and the other end to the clutch which operates the
crane drum—simple, easy to install, good for positive, depend-
able operation.

ing profession as a whole. The profes-
sion today enjoys a creditable reputa-
tion but it still has quite some distance
to travel before it can be ranked (in
the minds of the public), alongside the
century-old professions of Law or Medi-
cine. A quick glance at the under-
graduate training the lawyer gets in pre-
law and what the doctor receives in pre-
med is ample proof of the broad and
general knowledge that each of these
brings with him when the time comes
for him to specialize in his particular
field. For the full-fledged lawyer, seven
years of college are required; for the
doctor, seven years plus his internship.
Today at our University of Michigan a
five year course is offered for the pur-
pose of training women to become lab-
oratory specialists and technicians.
For those whose field is education, four
years of college work is just a drop in
the bucket; a college teacher is wont
to spend six, seven, even eight years in
his formal education. For the engineer,
in comparison, only four years are re-
quired. Comparatively speaking, a six-
year course is not asking too much.
No educational program in itself, re-
gardless of its merits, can fully edu-
cate a person in the correct sense of
the word. The best any curriculum can
do is to provide the student with the
proper tools and materials for building
his bridge to success.
What Thomas Henry Huxley has de-
fined as education is something all en-
gineers would do well to bear in mind
throughout their college life. "Educa-
tion is the instruction of the intellect in
the laws of nature under which name I
include not merely things and their
forces, but men and their ways; and the
fashioning of the affectations and of the
will into an earnest and loving desire to
move in harmony with these laws."
Today industry has a great deal of
confidence in the competent engineer.
It realizes the engineer's worth and is
assigning him a wide variety of respon-
sibilities; innumerable opportunities
exist. With the combination of a knowl-
edge of cultural subjects and the par ex-
cellence development of an analytical
mind by means of technical study, the
student educated under the six year plan
will have something very valuable to
offer his future employer.

length and height are frequently en-
countered on the lakes. Dr. Sadler sug-
gested a permissible longitudinal stress
equal to the cubed root of L, or about
8^2 tons Per square inch for a 600-foot
vessel. In practice, these stresses seldom
approach the above value.
A standard value of C = 0.35 in the
formula C = I/LBD, also proposed by
Dr. Sadler, is closely approximated by
existing values of 0.32 to 0.37 for dif-
ferent types of framing.
6. Speed. A long period of ship de-
sign has brought forth only a moderate
increase in speed. This is a natural
consequence of the low freight rates,
and the use of standard power plants.
For a proposed design several speeds
with corresponding power requirements
are assumed and curves derived for in-
come and operating cost. Fuel cost is
a dominant factor in operation and
modern design of boilers and machinery
permits the use of higher powers at the
same fuel outlay. Machinery weight
and initial cost also rise with power, and
maintenance is an important factor.
Certain trades and routes will support
higher speeds and the possible gain of
a single additional round trip in a
limited season must be considered.
There are other factors, however, which
also tend to control higher speeds. As
these lake forms are pushed the power
curve rises rapidly; excessive squat will
occur in channels; suction and wave
formations may cause damage, and a
check down in speed is frequently neces-
sary due to traffic lines in the rivers.
7. Form and Power. For some 40
years, the Naval Tank at the Univer-
sity of Michigan, under the direction of
Dr. H. C. Sadler, Professor E. M.
Bragg, and currently the author, has
been concerned with the testing and
refinement of hull designs for Great
Lakes vessels of all types. The bulk
freighter operates at speed-length ratios
(Vk divided by the square root of L)
of about 0.5 in contrast to an ocean-
going ore carrier (S.S. "VENORE") of
560 feet steaming at 16 knots (18*4
M.P.H.) for a Vk divided by the square
root of L of about 0.665 with a dead-
weight capacity of 24,250 tons at 34 ft.
2% in. draft. In the latter case, a block
coefficient of 0.755 contrasts with 0.87
to 0.88 in the lake carrier.
The parallel middle body includes
about 50% of the length with a section
(Continued from page 11)
coefficient of about 0.99. The deadrise
is 3 to 4 inches for docking purposes
and the bilge radius generally 3 to 4
feet. The standard shear required by
the freeboard rules results in unusable
cubic forward and aft plus increased
weight of hull. A considerable lower
shear is therefore adopted.
The entrance will use about 23% of
the length and sections are fairly well
standardized. Very little flare can be
used topsides due to the possibility of
damage to dock rigs when the vessel is
working on a forward spring line with
the stern away from the pier.
The run is a function of the area of
the midship section, making the balance
of the length and has been subject to
considerable improvement through re-
cent research. On some of the older
vessels, large moss covered areas on the
after buttocks indicated excessive wake
and poor flow. A slight increase in the
length of run, together with the adop-
tion of the cruiser stern has decreased
the towrope horsepower 5%, and in ad-
dition, provided better flow to the
wheel. The wake at the propeller is
high, 40 to 50%, but some gain is
recovered due to the possibility of
designing the wheel to turn at lower
revolutions, with consequent higher ef-
ficiency. The incorporation of twisted
stern posts for contra flow effect to the
wheel, and bulbous sections at the lower
aft end of the keel to equalize the wake,
appear to be worthwhile in the gain to
propulsive efficiency. An important
feature of the cruiser stern has been the
reduction in squat, especially in shoal
water.
The final choice of length of entrance,
parallel middle body and run practically
determines the longitudinal position of
the center of buoyancy, which in turn
must be vertically in line with the fore
and aft location of the center of gravity
of the loaded vessel in order to ensure
no trim. Freedom of form design, there-
fore, is always somewhat restricted or
compromised to balance internal ar-
rangement, hatch locations, and struc-
tural requirements.
The installed power is rated as I.H.P.
(indicated horsepower) for reciprocat-
ing engines; B.H.P. (brake horsepower)
for diesels; and S.H.P. (shaft horse-
power) for turbines or electric drive.
The S.H.P. is measured just aft of the
thrust block and hence is the unit of
torque common to all types of ma-
chinery. After allowing for the shaft
bearing and stern tube losses, the final
torque at the propeller is designated as
the D.H.P. (delivered horsepower).
From the resistance viewpoint the
power necessary to tow the vessel is
known as the T.R.H.P. (towrope horse-
power) or E.H.P. (effective horse-
power). The ratio TRHP/DHP is
called the P.C. (propulsive efficiency)
and is the relation between the thrust
and torque, the converting unit being
the propeller. The TRHP is made up
of the following components:
Smooth surface friction resistance—
F.H.P.
Power for appendage resistance—
A.H.P.
Still air resistance of above water
hull—S.A.H.P.
Wave and eddy making resistance—
W.H.P.
Extra power for surface roughness—
R.H.P.
The (FHP plus RHP) will account
for 70% to 80%,of the TRHP and may
be estimated by the following formula:
(FHP plus RHP) = 1.0216 [0.008486
plus 0.0516 / (8.793 plus L] S X Vk2-826
X 0.00307 where S = wetted surface in
sq. ft., L = length in feet, and Vk is the
speed in knots.
The wetted surface compares favor-
ably with other vessels on a displace-
ment basis and may be estimated from
the expression:
Bare S = L2 X K/10
where K is a function of length and dis-
placement. Values of K are shown be-
low.

draulic efficiency, of the propeller, and

Why some things get better all the time
THE TEMPTING FOODS spread before the family of to-
day are more nourishing and purer than ever before.
All the way from farm to table, modern means of
food preservation protect foods against damaging molds,
bacteria, insects—against loss of nutrients.
Chemical refrigerants preserve meat... nitrogen gas
safeguards the purity of canned foods ethylene oxide and "dry ice" pro-
tect wheat before it is milled... stain-
less steel tanks prevent contamination
of foods and beverages... and plastics
line many food containers.
Food preservation has become an industrial science
— and well illustrates the fact that when man has
better materials he can do better things.

Producing better materials for the use of industry and
the benefit of mankind is the work of UNION CARBIDE.
Basic knowledge and persistent research are required,
particularly in the fields of science and engineering.

operates at slips of 40 to 50% where
e o will be about 50 to 55% for a mod-
ern design. Through use of solid bronze
wheels or cast steel faired hubs with
bronze blades, contra fins, contra rud-
ders, fairing plates on the sternpost, and
twisted stern frames, values of C up to
1.37 have been obtained, with resulting
P.C. values of as high as 0.735. The
above features, installed on existing car-
riers through cooperation between the
University of Michigan Naval Tank
and the American Ship Building Com-
pany, have shown gains of 5% to 10%
in speed and up to 8% saving in coal
consumption.
Due to the number of factors affect-
ing the resistance of TRHP for a given
form at a given speed, it is impossible
to devise a single power parameter suf-
ficiently comprehensive to ensure pre-
cise estimates. Nevertheless, when a
group of similar type vessels are com-
pared there are several methods of plot-
ting power data which prove extremely
useful and reliable.
For example, the English have con-
sistently followed the C system in
which:

A 2/8 X Vk8
P = 0.746 X Vk/square root of 1

longitudinal coefficient, position of LCB,
shape of sections, etc., are indicated by
the spread of the individual C curves.
A simple method for comparison of
lake freighter form powers is suggested
below.
Let A = L j/L , where L l represents
the length of a ship whose power curve
is at hand. L, is the length of a similar
type ship for which an estimate of
power is required. The standard tem-
perature is 50° F.

The film carrier illustrated is
only one of many types made
from Synthane laminated plas-

the job because it stoutly resists
the corrosive action of develop-
ing solutions.
The teeth, though small, must
be strong and accurately in-

from Synthane.
Whenever in your future

will set up an oscillating field which will

Fig. 2 shows the oscillating field for a

the letter e. The d.c. electric field added

field, it will gain energy but will also
lose a certain portion of this energy to
the oscillating field, since it continually
moves in opposition to the oscillating
field. As a result of this action, energy
is transferred from the d.c. electric field
to the oscillating field. The electron, in
this manner, proceeds from cavity to
cavity gaining energy from the electric
field, losing it to the opposing alternat-
ing field until it finally reaches the
anode.
Since electrons are continually being
emitted by the cathode certain electrons
will leave the cathode while the oscil-
lating field is giving up energy. This,
of course, would nullify the effect of
the magnetron since the desired condi-
tion is one of energy supply and not
energy absorption. The electrons leav-
ing at this time, form a cycloidal path
that is tilted downward and the elec-
trons will return to the cathode after the
first half cycle. Thus, on an overall
picture, more energy is given to the
oscillating field than is withdrawn, and
the magnetron sustains oscillations. In
actual operation, the electron path is
more complicated; however, the under-
lying principles remain the same.
Essentially the magnetron is a fixed
frequency device, however, for many
applications it is desirable to vary the
frequency over certain narrow limits.
At the present time there are two gen-
eral types of frequency variation. In the
first method, the fundamental frequency
of one of the cavities is changed. An
external cavity is closely coupled to one
of the anode sections and the frequency
is varied by adjusting the frequency of
the external cavity. Frequency changes
up to 5 per cent may be made without
encountering difficulties in manufactur-
ing processes. Another method consists
of inserting rods into the centers of the
resonant cavities and thus directly
changing the frequency of the magne-
tron anode. This method of frequency
variation gives excellent response vari-
ation up to 12 per cent. Although this

Do you know that over 90% of all modern bearing requirements can be
met adequately with the Timken Tapered Roller Bearing? That in this one pre-
cision mechanism is contained a multiplicity of abilities which when fully ap-
preciated and properly applied can overcome any bearing condition you ever
may encounter?
DO you know that the Timken Roller Bearing is more than an anti-friction
bearing; more than a radial load bearing? That it is an all-load bearing — can
carry, all at once, radial loads, thrust loads, and any combination of them with
full efficiency and certainty?
Do you know that the Timken Bearing was introduced nearly 50 years
ago and has undergone constant engineering development and refinement ever
since? That the Timken-developed process of Generated Unit Assembly produces
true spherical (convex-concave) contact between the large ends of the rolls and
the rib or flange of the cone thereby reducing friction and initial wear to a
minimum; assuring correct alignment of
the rolls with respect to the races; help-
ing to distribute the loads evenly through-
out the bearing; decreasing operating
temperatures; producing quieter running;
and last, but not least, assuring that
when the bearing is properly mounted
no further adjustment is required?
DO you know that the special alloy
steel from which Timken Bearings are
made was developed in our own metal-
lurgical laboratories and is produced in
our own steel plant? That the Timken
Bearing is the only bearing manufactured
under one roof from raw material to
finished product?

the Timken Bearing, particularly how
it can help you in your engineering
career? Write us. The Timken Roller

sound, it is very difficult to manufac-
ture.
As was said previously, the magne-
tron is primarily used as pulse oscillator.
But using pulsed oscillations of short
duration (0.1 to 2.S microseconds in
duration) with a repetition rate of from
500 to 4500 pulses per second it is pos-
sible to obtain power ratings of about
2500 kilowatts. High power outputs are
possible since energy is stored for a long
period of time and is discharged in a
relatively short period. Consider the
case where the pulse is 1 microsecond
long and the repetition frequency is 500
pulses per second. Here the electron
will have 2000 microseconds to acquire
considerable energy and will discharge
it in 1 microsecond. The average power
for the magnetron is approximately 2
kilowatts for the same tube. Since the
desired frequency determines the rela-
tive size of the tube, the power handling
capacity of the tube must be engineered
into the circuit without greatly changing
its physical size. By using more reso-

in the number of cavities would also
increase the number of undesired modes
of oscillation certain limitations are
placed on the total number of cavities
possible. Present engineering practice
advises the use of a maximum of
eighteen cavities.
Resonant-cavity magnetrons have
been used primarily in the development
of microwave radar equipment. It is
suitable for operation between wave
lengths of 1 and 40 centimeters. Ex-
perimental tubes have been developed
for the generation of continuous oscilla-
tions at these high frequencies. The
magnetrons developed for continuous
wave generation are used for dielectric
heating, communications, and ultra-high
frequency applications where ordinary
electron tubes do not suffice. The pulsed
magnetron has recently been applied to
the development of high voltage electron
accelerators. Its ability to develop volt-
ages of about a million volts may at
some future date see it as a rival to the
cyclotron and betatron as a research
device in nuclear physics.

YORK makes climate-to-order
The huge turbo-compressor air con-
ditioning systems that serve millions
of cubic feet in the spinning rooms of
the ultra-modem plant of Celanese
Corporation of America at Celco,Va.,
are a far cry from the packaged air con -
ditioner which cools the fashionable
Lewis Gown Shop in Philadelphia.
But both are York Air Condition-
ing, and each does its job efficiently
and economically. It takes one sort
of climate to produce yarns for beau-
tiful fabrics, and another sort to sell
them, but both of these customers
are happy since each has just what
he asked for.
In your own business, whether your
problems involve air conditioning or
refrigeration, or both, three facts rec-
ommend your consideration of York:
1. The wide range of York equipment
as to function, type and capacity as-
sures selection of the right unit for
the right place, no matter how large
or how small.
2. The aggregate installed capacity
of York mechanical cooling for com-
mercial use exceeds that of any other
manufacturer.
3. York research—already responsible
for so many important advances—
has been accelerated and intensified

courses for the first year before deciding
to take her degree in Chemical Engi-
neering. Parts of her freshman and
sophomore years were spent working for
the Department of Engineering Re-
search, assisting Dr. Richard Schneide-
wind in the electro-chemistry lab.
Such time as any engineer can call
leisure, Lenore has spent with the So-
ciety of Women Engineers, and with the
A.I.Ch.E. since its reorganization in
1945. She holds office as secretary of
the A.I.Ch.E. this year, and also as En-
gineering Council Representative of
S.W.E. In the latter organization she
served on the refreshment committee
of the "Final Design" Engineering Ball
and is now serving on the Central Com-
mittee for the forthcoming Engineering
Open-House. Acting as orientation ad-
viser last fall occupied many more hours
with duties as both navigator and chap-
lain and seven freshmen girls entering
the Engine school.
Lenore expects to graduate in August
of this year and, according to present
plans, she will continue studying for a
Master's in Chemistry before seeking
employment. An interest in colloid
chemistry is being held in abeyance
until her graduate work is begun, since
there is no time for such courses in her
present schedule. All her electives have
been taken in Education in preparation
for a teaching certificate, though teach-
ing rates second choice in future hopes.
Possibly through parental influence,
or perhaps because of her pre-med sister
(also residing in Martha Cook), prefer-
ence is extended more toward employ-
ment in a pharmaceutical plant. Sales
work would be desirable, says she, be-
cause she likes to meet people—(don't
push, boys, just get in line).
Vacations usually are spent at home
enjoying all the outdoor sports avail-
able in a winter playground. Ice skat-
ing, skiing, tobogganing and swimming
are a few on the list, and a new one
recently acquired is golf. Her quickly
added statement concerning the last
mentioned (pharmaceutical) pillchasing
sport emphasized the fact that she
needed much more practice before going
on record as a golfer. This might be
sufficient hint for a golf date when the
season opens, for those of you with
sporting blood and spring fever—par-
ticularly since Lenore will be attending
summer school this year.

Developing better home cleaners has led
Hoover engineers into many fields. This
is clearly indicated by the fact that 274

of the 879 patented Hoover engineering
developments have been sought and used
by other manufacturing industries—many
of them far removed from the home ap-
pliance field.
Today an engineering staff of 130, one
third of them graduate engineers, is re-
quired to meet calls made on Hoover engi-
neering skill.
The Hoover Cleaner is "born" in the development
engineering division, where teamworking skilled de-
signers, inventors and engineers plan tomorrow's elec-
tric cleaners.
The laboratory division conducts research, studies
and tests, rejects or recommends each component
part of each new product "to be."
Mechanical engineers measure noise and vibration,
design fan systems, study cleaning methods and solve
power transmission problems in developing new designs.
Electrical engineers develop and test motors, wiring,
switches, lamps, etc., designing the right power plant
and accessories for a Hoover.
Product engineers solve manufacturing problems, set
up standards, see that Hoover quality is maintained.

SIXTY-EIGHT years ago a stranger got
off the train at Corning, New York,
and asked the station agent to direct him
to Corning Glass Works.
He had been sent by Thomas A. Edison
to see if Corning could succeed where
others had failed, in making a glass bulb
to surround the filament of his new
electric lamp.
Producing the thin bubble of glass for
Mr. Edison's first lamp was an early
milestone in Corning research. If he had
lived until his hundredth anniversary
this year, Edison would see machines de-
veloped by Corning turning out hun-
dreds of modern bulbs every minute.
Altogether Corning has contributed in
countless ways to science and industry
and the comfort of living. Casting the
200 inch telescope disc, which this year
will bring our civilization a billion "light
years" closer to the secrets of the universe,
is a Corning achievment.
So are the colored signals that guide
trains through the night in safety. So are
the miles and miles of America's neon
tubing, and the miles of acid resisting
glass piping in food and chemical plants.
So are gleaming Pyrex baking dishes and
amazing Pyrex Flameware for top-of-
stove cooking.
The very thermometer the doctor
puts in your mouth is quite likely
made of Corning tubing. Today
Corning research's main task is helping
manufacturers make better products
at lower cost. After graduation, this re-
search may help you get ahead faster.

progressed and the electron became a
vital part of our existence, engineers
and physicists were required to consid-
er electron transit time in the design of
ultra high frequency equipment. At
broadcast and short wave frequencies
the transit time is not an appreciable
part of a half cycle. However, at fre-
quencies in the microwave region, say
3000 megacycles for three centimeters
waves, the transit time may be several
cycles in duration. This phenomena of
electron transit time, assisted by inter-
electrode capacity and lead inductance,
rules out all tubes of conventional de-
sign for operation in the ultra high fre-
quency range. If conventional tubes
were to be used for UHF operation, it
would be necessary to make micro-
scopic electrode spacings, use exceed-
ingly high electrode potentials, or both.
This, however, would be undesirable.

Unmodified films of Dow latex 512 are strong and highly elastic.
Students majoring in chemistry will find much to interest them
in our new coatings laboratory where technicians are developing
significant new materials through research. Dow Latex 512,
recently introduced, is a good example of what goes on in this
laboratory which is an activity of the Dow division devoted to
resins, latices and plasticizers.
Dow Latex 512 is a coating material that promises great useful-
ness in the paint, paper, textile and adhesive industries. Its
principal film forming ingredient is based on a copolymer of
styrene and butadiene. On air-drying it forms a rubbery, pro-
tective film. It is compatible with conventional coating materials
and possesses good stability under agitation and freezing,
excellent pigment-binding characteristics and high protective
values.
Dow research is continuous in all divisions and there arc many
fields for young technicians who are preparing for this type
of work.

CHEMICAL COMMENTS
Flexible Heat for
Paint Processing
Flexible heating systems are a necessity to
many paint and varnish firms, where
high-temperature processing requirements
vary widely. In one Midwest finishes
plant, where processing temperature
requirements vary from simple heating to
complex sequences of heating and cool-
ing, Dowtherm, the high-temperature,
low-pressure heat transfer medium has
been installed. With this indirect heating
system they have found that temperatures
can be adjusted easily for every specific
job. The company uses a 3,000,000 Btu/hr.
Dowtherm vaporizer for heating and
an independent liquid-phase Dowtherm
cycle for cooling. Simple controls permit
the two cycles to be coordinated for a
variety of temperature combinations.
(Since installing the Dowtherm system,
the company has found that heating is
more efficient, processing more uniform,
equipment is simpler and larger batches
can be processed at a time.)
Disinfectants Produced
from Phenol Derivatives
Phenol derivatives arc
now being used in the
manufacture of many
disinfectants. These
phenol products, pro-
duced by Dow, are
known as Dowicides. They are noted for
their high germ killing powers which arc
largely retained in the presence of organic
matter. Other important properties:
excellent compatibility with cresols, pine
oils, soaps, low toxicity, and absence of
color and odor. These qualities indicate
the wide adaptability of Dowicides to the
manufacture of bactericides and fungicides.
Mold in Foods Prevented by
Dow Propylene Glycol
The food industry is making increasing
use of low-cost Dow propylene glycol to
keep many types of eatables palatable
and healthful, without risk of mold. . . .
This is a highly purified material of
pharmaceutical quality, free from odor
and taste. ... By adding small quantities
of Dow propylene glycol, food processors
can prolong freshness in foods—retain
full flavor—and actually decrease danger
of mildew.

nomena of velocity modulation for its
operation. In conventional electron
tubes the control grid regulates the
number of electrons that pass from the
cathode to plate. The electrons leaving
the cathode are under the influence of
the control grid field until they reach
the screen grid or the plate. Exceed-
ingly long transit time results in the
excessive loading of the control grid cir-
cuit. In the klystron the electrons are
under the influence of the grid over a
limited portion of the conducting path.
The grid, instead of varying the den-
sity of the electron beam, varies the
velocity of the individual electrons.
The variation in electron velocity con-
verts an electron beam of uniform den-
sity into one which is density-modu-
lated.
The essential parts of a klystron are
the electron gun, a gap region—usually
between two grids, a field-free drift
space in which the velocity-modulated
beam exists, and an output circuit
whose field is confined between another

pair of grids. The first RF control field
is called a buncher circuit; the output
circuit is commonly referred to as the
catcher. The RF buncher and catcher
voltages appear across their respective
grid gaps. The electric field produced
about the buncher and catcher gaps is
in the direction of the electron beam.

megacycles. Output is taken from the
wave guide in the lower right hand
corner.
Acceleration and deceleration of an
electron as it passes a gap is dependent
upon the magnitude of the oscillating
field, the phase of the field when the
electron enters the gap, and the time
required for the electron to traverse
the gap. If the transit time across the
gap is negligible, then the electron will
gain or lose an amount of energy cor-
responding to the gap voltage at the
time the electron is in the gap. The
electron beam is of uniform density as
it leaves the buncher gap, but its veloc-
ity varies periodically. In the drift
space the faster electrons catch up with
the slower ones, and the uniform-den-
sity beam is converted to a periodic
density-modulated beam. This density
modulated beam can deliver energy to
a load circuit. The catcher current is
non-sinusoidal in time and is of high
harmonic content. This catcher current
is useful for frequency multiplication
and the conversion efficiency is good
for high harmonic orders.

feeding catcher power to the buncher.
The phase of the catcher and buncher
voltage must be properly adjusted.
This is usually accomplished by adjust-
ing the D.C. anode potential. In this
adjustment, the feedback loop and the
electron drift distance must remain
constant. The variation in DC poten-
tial determines the number of RF cy-
cles spent in the drift space. As a
result, the oscillator generates power
between certain narrow limits.
The efficiency of the oscillator is de-
pendent upon the effective beam cur-
rent because the beam current varies
with the amount of power converted. If
the beam current is relatively low, the
power converted will be low, and the
oscillations will be of low amplitude.
If the beam current falls below the
starting current, oscillations cease im-
mediately. If the beam current is
raised above the optimum bunching
point, the efficiency drops even though
the power output continues to rise
slowly.
The two-gap klystron just described
requires the precise tuning of input and

output circuits. Since small values of
capacity produce an exceedingly large
variation in frequency at ultra high fre-
quencies, severe limitations are placed
on the two-gap klystron. If efficiency
is not the prime requirement, an os-
cillator can be designed in which the
buncher and catcher form a single com-
mon resonant circuit. Such a tube is
the reflext klystron.
In the reflex klystron, the elec-
trons leave the cathode and enter the
bunching field as in the conventional
two-gap klystron. However, in the re-
flex klystron, the electrons, after leav-
ing the buncher, are reversed in direc-
tion by a reflector plate which is
charged with a negative voltage with
respect to the cathode. The reflected
electrons pass through the buncher
which now acts as the catcher. Since
the initial electron velocity determines
the length of time spent by an electron
in the retarding field, velocity modula-
tion can produce density modulation.
The electrons of greater speed will
spend more time in the reflector area,
since they will be carried farther into
the field before being reflected back
to the buncher. Frequency variation
in the reflex klystron is accomplished
by varying the reflector potentials.
This wide variation in reflector volt-
age permits operation of the reflex
klystron over an extremely wide range
of frequencies.

There has been too much comment,
recently, to the effect that engineers are
unable to assume their social and civic
responsibilities, because their training
has been too narrow and specialized to
acquaint them with some of the broader
social and economic phases of life.
These critics (many of them are within
the engineering professions) maintain
that we, as engineering students, are be-
ing subjected to concentrated technical
programs of study which must neces-
sarily squeeze out the time necessary to
make a more complete study of our
economic, social, and political problems.
They describe us as stunted human be-
ings—persons who are chained to one
particular field of endeavor, trying to
unlock the secrets of a special branch of
technical work. We are said to be so
immersed in grubbing for new technical
facts and processes that we have neither
the time nor the inclination to view our
work in the overall picture of human
effort. Should we do this, they say, we
would be able to grasp the insignificance
of our tasks—we would see ourselves as
human horses, chained to the water-
wheel of a huge industrial structure. We
would see, they claim, that many scien-
tific and engineering developments have
created social strains upon the people—
new products throw people out of work
in established fields of production, the
restricted life in a factory system gener-
ates frustration and dissatisfaction in
the hearts of millions of workers, and
population shifts have been great and
sudden, throwing both the newly devel-
oped and the declining areas out of so-
cial and economic balance.
Our critics further maintain that en-
gineers, the creators of the world's ma-
jor materialistic advances, have neither
the power nor the ability to direct their
work. They declare that our efforts and
the products of our efforts are subject
to the poorly understood laws of eco-
nomic supply and demand and to the
caprices of financial interests, in secur-
ing for certain corporations monopolistic
market conditions and in repressing
many products and developments to the
detriment, possibly, of the public inter-
est. One example of these problems is
the struggle between the advocates of
rail-freight transportation and the sup-
porters of the proposed St. Lawrence
Seaway. Another is the fight to main-
tain the status-quo production and use
of coal-fuel as against many persons'
assertions that a national system of gov-
ernment-subsidized natural-gas pipelines
would bring a much cheaper, cleaner,
more efficient fuel into general public
use for all heating purposes.
What is the proper way to react to
these criticisms? Are we "so bad?"
Should we curl up in a huff and gruffly
denounce our critics as persons who are
trying to fix the blame for the world's
problems upon a particular group of
hard-working people? Or, to be more
serious, should we be open-minded
enough to try to determine the truth
of the foregoing remarks of our critics?
The truth is that they have hit our
''thin skin" when they begin to criticize
us for anything. We dislike having any-
one make a few pertinent comments
about us, but are we justified in refusing
to examine the balance of our overall
education?
No, the logical facts seem to be borne
out that an engineer has an insufficient
opportunity in college to acquire a de-
tailed knowledge of his social and eco-
nomic relationships to the rest of so-
ciety. We are going to school to be,
eventually, highly competent engineers,
In addition to developing a keen ana-
lytical ability at solving problems, we
must necessarily absorb a huge amount
of details and facts about our field of
work. To do our part of the world's
work efficiently, we must spend most of
our study time concentrating on these
specialized topics. It is understandable
that we should be relatively undevel-
oped in our knowledge of topics outside
of engineering.
This, then, is our challenge — what
are we going to do about it? If certain
phases of engineering have adverse ef-
fects upon the people, so what? If the
engineer is being directed by his supe-
riors to develop products which can be
used by political leaders for promoting
war, who cares, as long as the job is
soundly engineered? If the engineers
increased the atom bomb's original ef-
ficiency by 600%, that's a good job well
done, isn't it? (Of course it is, but to
what purpose will it be used?) We ought
to see, too, that modern design isn't the
most important thing in life.
It will take exceptional engineers to
transcend the limitations of their tech-
nical work, but transcend them they
must. At the present time, engineering
has become a complex study, and so-
ciety is forced more and more to adjust
itself to social changes which all the
new developments cause, rather than to
control the use of these discoveries to
the best public interest. As engineering
students we cannot hope to find all the
right answers to social problems, but
we have the grave responsibility of be-
ing able to guide the effects of our work.
We will, at least, have to understand
many more ideas besides our technical
details. It will be a lifetime process of
accepting community responsibilities
and leadership in addition to our daily
work.
If we choose to remain as we are
today, absorbed in technical problems
to the exclusion of everything else, we
will never be more than the plow-horses
of industry. If, however, we decide to
exert our energies toward directing civic
and social development, we can con-
ceivably exercise a great and good in-
fluence on society, helping to solve the
public problems of our time. The direc-
tion in which we develop depends upon
our ambitions and many decisions made
in college. We will become useful lead-
ers, rather than tools of society, if we
really want to.

Electrical engineers practice in a field of such breadth that
complete classification of subject matter and functional duties
is difficult. The main subdivisions in which training is offered
by the department may be mentioned briefly. Electrical power
engineering has to do with the theoretical and practical phases
of power generation, distribution, and utilization. Electrical
communication deals with the transmission of signals, speech,
music, and pictures by open-wire lines, by cables, and by
radio. Illumination engineering is concerned with the problems
arising in the production and utilization of light in accordance
with correct principles of physics, economics, physiology, psy-
chology, and art. Design involves the application of the funda-
mentals of electricity and heat to the production of new or
improved electrical apparatus. Electronics deals with the indi-
vidual and statistical behavior of electrons, ions, and atoms in
various types of electrical equipment, in order to permit a ra-
tional analysis of the action in electron tubes, switches, recti-
fiers, welding processes, etc. Industrial electrical engineering
includes the study of applications and control of electricity in
industrial plants.

TAX AUTHORITY
The Story of
DONALD MILLHAM
THE average man who stews over
the filing of his annual tax return
is apt to shake his head quizzically
over Donald L. Millham.
While he was in charge of General
Electric tax accounting, Don used to
file more than 500 returns a year -
and like it. In some years the sums
he paid out in taxes exceeded the
Company's net income by more than
four times.
Although he has a new job today
—the difficult and important one of
Comptroller for the company—Don
maintains an active interest in cor-
porate taxation and is still considered
one of the company's tax authorities.
A career in corporate taxation prob-
lems is, Don admits, short on glamor,
long on hard and diligent work. In
his early years with G.E. he had
learned a great deal about business
methods in the company's Business
Training Courses, and had worked as
an accountant and traveling auditor.
But until 1935 he had little more to
do with taxation than the filing of his
own returns.
Then an opportunity opened in tax
accounting. He took the offer and
learned the background, the technical
language, the legal complexities of his
job as he did it.
By meeting the challenges of an
exacting and constantly expanding
field of endeavor, Donald Millham
has made for himself a career with
General Electric that is useful and
important, and which has held his
interest.
Next to schools and the U.S. Govern-
ment, General Electric employs
more college engineering graduates
than any other organization.


To help pay his way through Union Col-
lege, Don worked for General Electric
during summer vacations, operating a drill
press.

For five years Don worked as a travelling
auditor, made a good record. In 1935, with-
out any prior experience in taxation, he took
over General Electric tax accounting.

After graduating with honors, he enrolled
in the G-E Business Training Course, gained
insight into modern business operation.

Learning the job as he worked at it, he
became the company's tax authority, filing
500 returns a year. Today he has the
difficult and important job of Comptroller.

Yesterday it was sufficient to call yourself simply
an Electrical, Mechanical or Chemical Engineer.
But today we think in terms of specific functions
performed . . . such as research, design, develop-
ment or application engineering. For example,
Westinghouse employs:
RESEARCH ENGINEERS ...
to investigate physical laws to extend scientific
knowledge—or applied research to solve specific
manufacturing problems, develop new apparatus.
DESIGN ENGINEERS ...
to design all types of electrical apparatus to meet
new or specialized requirements. Such work involves
not only the writing of mechanical and electrical
specifications but the selection of materials, manu-
facturing processes and many other functions.
DEVELOPMENT ENGINEERS ...
to evolve the desired product in physical form; to
steer the product through infancy until it is a
success.
APPLICATION ENGINEERS . . .
to analyze new projects, recommend needed equip-
ment; and to decide what type of apparatus will do
the best job for the customer.
SERVICE ENGINEERS ...
to direct installation and repair at the customer's
plants; to handle emergency breakdowns. G-10003
These are but a few of the many oppor-
tunities for engineers in the electrical held.
There are many others—in sales or manu-
facturing at Westinghouse. Begin plans for

metal sleeve
The majority of safety devices devel-
oped in industry are in the form of
some insignificant part, which everyone
feels could accomplish practically no-
thing. When blind-landing devices were
first being made, an additional condens-
er or resistor could have saved the lives
of many men. During the war, the
Navy came across many such circum-
stances. One of the most interesting

devices is a tiny metal sleeve, too small
to fit over your little finger, yet capable
of saving many lives and much equip-
ment.
While training anti-aircraft gunners,
the Navy was definitely in need of aerial
tow targets which could be towed by a
steel cable at a considerable distance
behind the tail of the airplane. As the
target was launched it was essential that
the cable leave the plane quickly
through some type of guide sleeve.
Considerable difficulty was encoun-
tered when the sleeve would become
completely worn after one or two op-
erations. At times the cable would be-
come frayed and would even break. As
a result the cable would have to be
severed to free the ship from the drag-
ging cable before landing.
Eventually American ingenuity went
to work and someone decided to make
the steel sleeve from the same material
that was used to machine Naval guns.
This metal (carboloy cemented car-
bide)—the hardest metal known to man
—solved the problem. Statistics show
that as high as 3,000,000 feet of stain-
less steel have passed through one of
these sleeves without showing the least
sign of wear on the sleeve.
electronic dynamometer
A newly developed testing unit for
automobile engines is called the "Elec-
tronic Dynamometer." Engines were
formerly tested for an hour and half by
mechanical equipment on dynamometer
test stands. This newly-developed, elec-
tronically controlled tester is able to
complete the job in only twenty min-
utes.
As the engine is swung onto the unit,
quickly-attached piping for fuel, lubrica-
tion, water, and exhaust is secured. For
the first five minutes of the test the en-
gine runs at idling speed, 500 rpm.,
while clean filtered oil flows through the
crankcase, clearing away the debris of
manufacture. The generator in the
control panel then opens the engine up
to half load, while electric controls make
all needed adjustments in fuel supply,
and meters show immediately whether
or not all parts of the engine are prop-
erly functioning. During the first seven
minutes of the twelve minute half-load
run, filtered oil is still being pumped
through the crankcase, but the last five
minutes see this supply cut off, and oil
is circulated through the engine just as
it must do in actual operation. The full-
load test run lasts only three more min-
utes, but this is sufficient to show the
operator what parts of the engine are
acting badly. If the test is satisfactory,
the automatic electronic tester shuts the
engine down after its twenty-minute
test, and oil, gas and water are drained.
Then the engine is ready for installa-
tion.
The final inspection of the engine can
be made while it is mounted on the elec-
tronic dynamometer, and the operator
checks all connections for looseness or
imperfect fit. Thus this twenty-five min-
ute test has completely replaced the
hour-and-a-half run that was previously
required.
half-a-million volts
The voltage limit on electric-power
transmission is now 287,000 volts, but
research in the planning stage would
raise this maximum figure to 500,000.
To further the investigation of high-
voltage transmission lines, ten Amercian
manufacturing firms are cooperating in
a large scale test, in which three-phase
power will be conducted over one and
one-half miles of test power-lines from
the Tidd generating station of the Ohio
Power Company. The carrier towers
are being constructed by the American
Bridge Company, and will facilitate
variable spacing and positioning of the
conductors, which are being supplied by
several concerns specializing in copper
and aluminum products.
General Electric Company will pro-
vide switching equipment and lightning
arresters for the enormously high-volt-
age being used, and Westinghouse will
design the power-transformers and high-
ly sensitive metering equipment.
The purpose of this investigation is
to expand our present knowledge of the
limiting factors in high-voltage power
transmission, and the effects of corona
losses and radio interference will be ex-
plored.
In addition, the lines will be operated
throughout the year, and the impor-
tance of icing, high winds, and other
weather problems will be probed. The
engineers planning the tests hope that
they will reveal more economical means
of building and operating power-lines
than are known today, by showing how
the influencing factors may be more
successfully balanced.

midget sterilamp
A midget ultraviolet Sterilamp. half
the size of a hen's egg, which will improve
the food-keeping qualities of home re-
frigeration for five cents a month, has
recently been developed.
The new lamp, placed inside the
cabinet, simultaneously emits bacteria-
killing rays and produces ozone in the
air. It is indispensable in high humid-
ity cabinets where spoilage and mold
growth would ruin the food and fruits
inside. In lower humidity cabinets the
main problem has been accumulation of
food odors. The ozone produced by
the Sterilamp diffuses rapidly through-
out the entire cabinet, purifying the
food vapors by breaking down the va-
por molecules.
The three and one-half watt minia-
ture Sterilamp operates only when the
refrigerator compressor is running, and
on this basis, at least one year's life
for the lamp is assured.
aerial photos
The repeating Flash Tube, which
played an important war role in aiding
night aerial photography, has been con-
verted to peacetime uses. In addition
to photographic applications, it is being
used in airway and waterway beacons.
Its operation is based on the instan-
taneous discharge of electricity through
an atmosphere of an inert gas. Powered
by a special electronic source, the tube
gives flashes of illumination so intense
that night photographs are made possi-
ble from altitudes up to two miles.
An improved blue lacquer, produced
for daylight photoflash lamps, increases
the transmission of the bulb nearly 50
per cent, and the photographic effective-
ness in the same order. Of a lighter
blue, it has spectral characteristics suit-
able for a greater number of daylight-
color films than that previously used.

JL/O you know that over 90% of all modern bearing requirements can be
met adequately with the Timken Tapered Roller Bearing? That in this one pre-
cision mechanism is contained a multiplicity of abilities which when fully ap-
preciated and properly applied can overcome any bearing condition you ever
may encounter?
Do you know that the Timken Roller Bearing is more than an anti-friction
bearing; more than a radial load bearing? That it is an all-load bearing — can
carry, all at once, radial loads, thrust loads, and any combination of them with
full efficiency and certainty?
I/O you know that the Timken Bearing was introduced nearly 50 years
ago and has undergone constant engineering development and refinement ever
since? That the Timken-developed process of Generated Unit Assembly produces
true spherical (convex-concave) contact between the large ends of the rolls and
the rib or flange of the cone thereby reducing friction and initial wear to a
minimum; assuring correct alignment of
the rolls with respect to the races; help-
ing to distribute the loads evenly through-
out the bearing; decreasing operating
temperatures; producing quieter running;
and last, but not least, assuring that
when the bearing is properly mounted
no further adjustment is required?
DO you know that the special alloy
steel from which Timken Bearings are
made was developed in our own metal-
lurgical laboratories and is produced in
our own steel plant? That the Timken
Bearing is the only bearing manufactured
under one roof from raw material to
finished product?

the Timken Bearing, particularly how
it can help you in your engineering
career? Write us. The Timken Roller

H. R. CRANE,
Professor of Physics
It is perhaps fortunate for us that
sub-atomic matter is securely put to-
gether. The bonds that hold one con-
stituent particle to another are exceed-
ingly difficult to break. Yet our only
successful method of studying the archi-
tecture of the sub-atomic world is to
break those bonds, and to do so by
means of high speed projectiles. The
"Racetrack" which is now under con-
struction on the campus is the latest
development in a long evolution of ma-
chines for the production of high speed
projecticles.
If an electrically charged particle,
such as an electron or a positive ion,
which is to be used as a projectile, is
placed in a strong electric field, a force
will act upon it, which will accelerate
it. If the field is strong enough and is
applied over a great enough distance,
the particle will acquire a tremendous
velocity, enough so that when it collides
with an atomic nucleus, the nucleus will
be split or otherwise drastically changed.
By observing and analyzing the frag-
ments of such collisions, facts about the
structure of matter can be pieced to-
gether.
The kind of machine first used for
the acceleration of charged particle
projectiles consisted of a long glass
vacuum tube, with a source of particles
at one end and the target material at
the other. A high voltage—as much as
1,000,000 volts—was often applied be-
tween the ends of such a tube. A nat-
ural limitation in this method was soon
found, in that voltages much greater
than 1,000,000 were difficult to produce
and to manage, at least in the ordinary
size laboratory room. Necessity then
gave birth to an important invention in
the form of a method whereby a given
charged particle could be subjected to
many successive accelerating kicks by
the same electric field. This means that
it could be brought up to a final energy
many times as great as it would have
acquired by falling through the field
just once, as in the earlier type machine.
Of course, if the same particle is to be
kicked many times, it has to be made to
move in a circle or a spiral. This is

H. R. Crane
easily accomplished by the application
of a magnetic field. A charged particle
moving in a magnetic field takes a
curved path due to the force which acts
at right angles to its direction of motion
and to the direction of the magnetic
field. Think of a moving charge as be-
ing an electric current, and apply the
"right hand rule" and you will see that
this force which acts at right angles to
its direction of motion is the same force
that makes a motor run.
The circular type of accelerating ma-
chine is, then, one in which the charged
particle is made to move in a circle by
the application of a magnetic field and
in which it is given a forward kick by
an electric field every time it comes
around. The cyclotron is an important
example, and was the first machine mak-
ing use of this principle. In the cyclo-
tron the vacuum chamber in which the
particles move is placed between the
poles of an electromagnet (the largest
of which weighs 4,000 tons) and the
electrical kicks are furnished by a pair
of electrodes called dees, which are
driven by a powerful radio oscillator.
The cyclotron is useful only for the
acceleration of heavy projectiles (posi-
tive ions) and cannot handle electrons.
I shall try to explain the reason for this.
Heavy particles, even after receiving
the tremendous energy given to them in
the cyclotron, do not move with a veloc-
ity near that of light. Therefore they
obey the ordinary laws of motion quite
closely, and show little of the peculiar
behaviour demanded by the theory of
relativity. The ordinary laws of motion
will tell you that, as the particle moves
round and round in a fixed magnetic
field, its frequency of revolution remains
constant, even though it is continually
gaining energy. As it gains energy it
moves in larger and larger circles, but
the increase in distance around is just
compensated by the additional speed, so
the frequency remains constant. This
allows the electrical kicks to be admin-
istered at constant intervals. Thus both
the strength of the magnetic field and
the frequency of the oscillator can re-
main fixed.
The electron, on the other hand, is
so light a projectile that if it is given
any considerable energy, it moves with
a velocity very near that of light. The
theory of relativity tells us that the
speed of light can only be approached
and never surpassed. If a particle is
moving with nearly the velocity of light,
and we add more energy to it, its veloc-
ity increases only slightly; the main
effect is that its mass increases. The
energy added is stored in the form of
extra mass, according to the equation
made famous by the atomic bomb,
E = mc2. An electron which comes out of
the racetrack will have 600 times the
mass of an electron at rest and will be
moving at 99.9999% of the velocity of
light.
If we should try to accelerate an
electron in a cyclotron, it would move in
a path of greater radius as it gained
energy, but, for the reason given above,
its velocity would not increase propor-
tionately, so it would take longer and
longer for each succeeding revolution. A
high frequency electric accelerating field
of fixed frequency would not work; the
electron would quickly get out of step
with it.
If the cyclotron idea is modified so
that the magnetic field strength is raised
as the electron gains energy, the path
can be held to a constant radius. Since
the velocity is about constant (near the

ROBERT J. CUSTAFSON, '48E
Though it has been common for
many years to develop high pressures
in steam turbines and compressed air
containers, the removing of minute
particles of gas from chambers has been
quite another matter. Until recently,
the only really high vacuums were ob-
tainable in the laboratory, but recent
developments along this line have made
possible such varying discoveries as the
dehydration of foods in which the nu-
tritive value and taste of the original
substance is clearly evident after recon-
stitution. The atomic bomb researches
have made extensive use of high vacu-
ums, especially in the electromagnetic
and gaseous-diffusion methods of separ-
ation of isotopes; these uses required
the world's largest diffusion pumps. In
the metallurgical industry thermal re-
duction is applicable to many of the
lower melting-point metals such as the
reduction of magnesium from dolomite
ores. Still another use is the casting of
metals in a vacuum to reduce the inci-
dence of blow-holes and oxidation ef-
fects.
In the rotary vacuum pump, the leak-
age of air around the vanes and rotor
limits the ultimate pressure to about
five microns or five-one thousandths of
a millimeter of mercury. In evacuating

a vessel, the efficiency of the pump
drops off rapidly as the vessel pressure
decreases, until at the point where the
vessel is at the pump's ultimate pres-
sure, where the efficiency is zero. There-
fore, processes using rotary pumps are
limited to applications where the cham-
ber pressure is somewhat greater than
the ultimate pressure of the pump.
The vacuum diffusion pump may be
used ahead of the rotary pump where
a higher vacuum is required than a

A complete pumping system containing several diffusion pumps, a rotary pump,
and miscellaneous pipes and valves.
rotary pump alone is able to produce.
The principle of diffusion as applied to
vacuum pumps is not new, but earlier
pumps were constructed of glass and
were therefore limited in capacity. Al-
though other liquids such as mercury
may be used, the most common type is
perhaps that utilizing oils. The oil is
rapidly evaporated in an electrically
heated boiler in the base of the pump.
This oil vapor is forced up through
central chimneys to the various jets.
From the top the oil molecules travel
downward and collide with gas mole-
cules that have diffused into the region.
Since in these high vacuum systems the
gas molecules are relatively few and far
between, there is no means for the oil to
reach out and trap the gas molecules.
Instead, the operation of this pump de-
pends upon the chance collision of a
gas molecule with an oil molecule and
the subsequent carrying out of the gas
molecule to a point where the oil is
reclaimed and the gas exhausted. Since
this process must of necessity wait for
the diffusion of a gas particle to diffuse
into the pump, it is a slow process, and
is used only where the last fraction of
a micron of pressure is important
enough to justify its removal. However,
since it has no moving parts, the sim-
plicity of operation and maintenance
recommends it highly. The incorpora-
tion of both high pumping speeds and
high maximum exhaust pressures in the
same pump is impractical, so the solu-
tion to the problem of a high rate of
flow with a high ultimate vacuum in ad-
dition to a high maximum exhaust pres-
sure lies in the use of two types of
pumps. These two types are the pri-
mary diffusion pump and the booster
diffusion pump.
The booster diffusion pump has been
developed to operate against exhaust
pressures as high as 2 mm for pumps
using oil and 25 mm for mercury-type
pumps. The maximum exhaust pres-
sure, i.e., the highest pressure against
which the diffusion pump can operate,
is important because it determines
the capacity of the supporting pump.

Pumping speed characteristics of a six-
Therefore, the maximum exhaust pres-
sure of the diffusion pump should be
as high as possible. Since the boiler
pressure must be appreciably higher
than the exhaust pressure being
pumped against, seals must be very
carefully made, and cooling by means
of water jackets must be used to pre-
vent "backstreaming," or the backing-
up of the oil stream by re-evaporation
of the oil after passing through the
jets. Heat is generally supplied by an
electric current passing through beaters
clamped at the base of the boiler plate,
and careful insulation protects against
undue heat loss to the atmosphere. A
micro-switch disconnects the current in
the case of a water failure.
The primary diffusion pump operates
with higher ultimate vacuum, but is
based on much the same principle as the
booster pump. However, since it must
handle a greater volume of rare gases,
the cross-sectional area must be larger,
and the limiting factor of these dimen-
sions is the maximum exhaust pressure
of approximately ISO microns. There-
fore, to operate the primary pump at
optimum pumping speed, the maximum
exhaust pressure must be sacrificed.
The two main pumping mediums
used in diffusion pumping systems are
mercury and certain oils possessing low
vapor pressure characteristics. Mercury
pumps are ideally adaptable to such ap-
plication as mercury-arc rectifiers. Here
the migration from mercury pump to
mercury-arc apparatus causes no troub-
le, whereas if oil were used in the pump,
diffusion in either direction would un-
doubtedly cause difficulties. One im-
portant advantage of mercury diffusion
pumps is the fact that maximum ex-
haust pressures of up to 25 mm may

be obtained. Due to the inactivity and
nontoxicity of oils, however, they are
finding greater use, and many special
oils have been developed to satisfy the
requirements, such as that stated, of
low vapor pressure. The highest avail-
able ultimate vacuums have been ob-
tained with oil-operated pumps, but
the cracking of oils under extreme tem-
peratures causes sludges to be formed,
and these sludges and other decomposi-
tion products have a corrosive action on
metals used in the pumps, such as cop-
per. The coming of age of silicone liq-
uids, however, promises to remove this
difficulty due to their ability to with-
stand high temperatures and pressures.
A typical complete portable vacuum
pumping system comprises primary and
booster diffusion pumps, rotary vacuum
pumps, vacuum valves, refrigerative
baffles, and pressure-indicating devices.
The development of high-vacuum
equipment in industrial sizes has made
possible the deposition of metallic films
to make front-surface mirrors, coatings
of silver on mica for use in fixed conden-
sers, and thin uniform films of gold for
filter purposes. Aluminized mirrors for
astronomical studies have been made in
sizes up to 100 inches in diameter at a
pressure of 10~3 mm of mercury. Among
the more important precautions which
must be taken in the production of
metallic films are the complete elimina-
tion of water vapor, the sustaining of
the high vacuum throughout the whole
process, and the proper cleaning of the
surfaces to be coated.
Most metals, ranging from the very
active alkali metals to the noble metals,
are readily deposited with a few excep-
tions. Zinc, because of its chemical af-
finity for the heating equipment gen-
erally used, requires special treatment,
as do chromium, platinum, molybdenum
and tungsten, whose ultra-high melting
points create difficulties. These metals
must be deposited by the process known

by
KENNETH W. ALLISON, '48E
"Dean Bursley, just how long do you
think it will take to finish up your loose
ends of work here at the University-—
before you leave the University hall for
good?"
''Indefinitely!" answered the Dean,
with a firmness which carried the un-
spoken feeling of: "I raised this school
from a pup, and just because it's a big
dog now doesn't change my mind the
least bit. I have my ME 3 book to re-
vise—friends drop in occasionally—the
only trouble is I can't smoke in this
place."
Dean Bursley has enjoyed his job as
Dean of Students—"a lot of headaches
with it, perhaps, but those things we
soon forget and remember only the more
pleasant points. Thousands of students
have gone through this office—$125,000
to $150,000 has been distributed every
year to from twelve to fifteen hundred
students and I saw every one of them.
I have been teaching ME 3 right along,
too. Checking over my records, I be-
lieve I've taught Heat Engines to about
two thousand engineers."
When asked what the biggest head-
aches had been, the Dean replied,
"Every time a job came along that no
one knew what to do with, they dumped
it over here." The remains of the dump-
ings are evident in the fourteen boards
and committees of which the Dean of
Students was a member and in the four-
teen specific duties which were under
his supervision.
future plans
Mulling thoughtfully over future
plans, the Dean recalled some of the
personal desires left unfinished under
pressure of his many active years of
service to the University. The rose
garden at his home, 2107 Hill Street,
needs better care this summer; many
reels of movie film await editing and
splicing; and in his twenty-five years
as Dean of Students he has collected
voluminous files of everything from
humorous reminders of long-gone stu-
dents to documents and photographs
important in University history. And,
indeed, the Dean is better qualified than
anyone now on campus to write the
history of our College of Engineering.
Truthfully, "he raised it from a pup,"
or, more correctly, he grew up with it.
A BMOC of the early 1900's, Dean
Bursley is a charter member of Tri-
angles, Tau Beta Pi, Phi Eta Sigma,
and Phi Kappa Phi, and is a member of
Vulcans and ASME. As one of the
fathers of the Union, he was the first
life member, chairman of the first Union
House Committee, chairman of the
Building Committee, member of the
cash-raising Campaign Committee, and
he has been a member of the Board of
Directors since about 1910.
Turning this century's calendar over
and even a few years back into the
"Gay Nineties" era, we might begin the
story of prospective engineer Joe Burs-
ley as he left his home in Ft. Wayne,
Indiana, in the fall of 1895. The first
class in a new College of Engineering
opened with courses in Civil, Mechani-
cal, and Electrical Engineering. Previ-
ously, all engineering courses were
taught under jurisdiction of what is
now a traditional enemy, Liberal Arts.
1895 saw the parting of the ways of
these schools, and Joe was in on the
ground floor of the budding Engine
School.
first engineer
Students in those days were given a
number upon enrolling and Bursley
rated number two in his class of seven-
ty-five men. A young man named
Duffy held the first place ticket—but
before any degrees were distributed to
the class of '99E Duffy had become
an educational casualty, leaving Joe as
number one graduate of the College of
Engineering.
During his student days in Ann
Arbor, the Dean engaged in such class
athletics as football, baseball, and track,
and managed the track team as well.
Expressions of the youthful Joe Bursley
were given vent through the Comedy
Club, putting on humorous plays, and
also by active membership in Friars.
For a "change of atmosphere" Joe
took his Junior year at Cornell, but
returned to Michigan the following year
to receive his degree in Mechanical En-
gineering.
The next three years were spent eat-
ing soot as special apprentice in the
Pennsylvania Railroad Shops and out
on the road. Returning to Indiana in
1903, after a brief vacation in Europe,
he spent a short time in the wholesale
grocery business with his father, and
then joined the faculty at Michigan.
student and teacher
Never having had the benefit of
liberal education, the Dean enrolled in
Lit School, carrying twelve hours credit
in morning classes and teaching Me-
chanical Engineering every afternoon.
True to his earlier decision, he left at
the end of the semester despite the
pleas of Prof. Allen, head of the ME
department, and Dean Cooley.
"Playing around out East" that sum-
mer brought little in the way of mone-
tary returns, so, having no prospective
job in sight, Dean Bursley accepted a
second offer of University officials and
returned to Ann Arbor. Within a
couple of years, in 1908, the Dean es-
tablished permanent roots in Ann Arbor
by his marriage to Marguerite Knowl-
ton, daughter of a Law School profes-
sor.
Trips to Europe with the American
Society of Mechanical Engineers for
meetings with the British Engineering
Society in England, 1910, and the
Vereines Deutscher Ingenieure, Ger-
many, 1913, afforded contact with inter-
national engineering.
began new engineering course
Appointment as a member of the
Committee on Student Affairs in 1912
laid the foundation for his later work
as the first Dean of Students. This ad-
vancement was postponed, however, by
a two year leave of absence which took
the Dean to the East Coast. Here he
worked and studied scientific manage-
ment and industrial engineering, and
in 1915 he returned to the University
to begin the first courses in time study
and industrial engineering.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Joseph A. Bursley
During the summer of 1916, with the
smell of European gunpowder on the
winds, Dean Bursley went to Platts-
burg for military training. Early in
1917 found the United States actively
in the war, and Bursley modified his
industrial engineering courses to cover
the subject of handling military stores.
By government request the courses were
continued through fall of 1917, training
men for positions in the Army Quarter-
master Corps.
army career
In December he was commissioned
a Major in the Army Ordnance De-
partment for supervisory duties con-
cerning these courses, and within a
month he had been called to Washing-
ton as chief of the Instruction Section.
In May of 1918 he was transferred to
Detroit as Chief of the Plant Section
for Ordnance.
Following the end of the war, a
transfer to head of the Salvage Bureau
and Commanding Officer of the Detroit
Salvage Depot held him in military
service until October, 1920. But the
University was getting impatient for his
return. During the spring of 1920 he
taught classes at 7 o'clock every morn-
ing and then drove to Detroit to assume
the role of Lt. Colonel Bursley. After
his military discharge, the Dean spent
20 years as a Colonel in the Army Re-
serve.
The following year, Professor Bursley
became Dean Bursley and took over a
small part of the Registrar's office for
his own use. Nibbling at all sides for
the last twenty-five years, his office has
grown to the extent that it threatens to
push all else out the doors of University
Hall. If the dumping of orphan jobs
continues, his successor, E. H. Walter,
Director of the Office of Student Affairs,
will need most of the new administra-
tion building for an office.
During recent years, Dean Bursley
has twice been guardian angel to visit-
ing foreign groups. In 1941 about fifty
South Americans, ranging from high
school graduates to doctors, lawyers,
and bankers, spent two months at the
University. It became the Dean's as-
signment to conduct the group on vari-
ous tours to nearby cities, to arrange
daily activity schedules, and to oversee
the personal welfare of each member
of the party. The Michigan Club of
Quito was formed in Quito, Ecuador,
not long after their departure, and Dean
Bursley was presented with a colorful,
hand-painted certificate naming him
honorary president of the club. In 1943
a similar excursion of Chilean engineers
who came to Ann Arbor to attend grad-
uate school, was placed in the Dean's
lap for guidance.
For these and many more closely re-
lated reasons, Dean Bursley, Dean of
Students, and Miss Lloyd, Dean of
Women, were pictured as angels guard-
ing figurative University children in a
mural hung at the Wolverine Club in
the basement of Lane Hall a few years
ago. Though the orginal mural has
since disappeared, a few prints are still
in existence; one of these is cherished
by the Dean.
community service
A bit of experience on the City
Council of Ft. Wayne, Indiana, back in
1903, interested the Dean in civic af-
fairs to the extent that he found time
to serve two terms on the Ann Arbor
City Council. But with more and more
responsibilities added to his University
work, he was finally forced to exclude
this position from his activities.
Though not a member of any fra-
ternity, during the last seven years the
Dean has served as Educational Advisor
for the National Interfraternity Con-
ference. Resigning from active educa-
tional service, forced him to give up the
job, but he has been handed a new
assignment with the Conference—that
of Chairman of the Committee for co-
operation with Colleges and Universities.
Obviously it is incorrect to assume
that Dean Bursley's resignation means
the end of his services to American
students or even to Michigan students.
If you doubt this at all, just walk over
to University Hall and ask to see him.
As much a chaplain as ever, the Dean
is still here to offer the counsel of his
wisdom.

ENGINEERING OPEN-HOUSE

The year 1947 found the Engineering Council of the University of
Michigan searching for a means of bringing before the public the new activi-
ties and advances in Engineering. Looking back, the members came across
a time-honored tradition of the University, that of holding a biannual Engi-
neering Open-House. The 1947 Open-House was slated for April 18, and a
committee was formed to plan the revival of this pre-war event.
John M. Cox was appointed chairman of the Open-House Committee,
and Lenore Olsen assumed the role of secretary. Associate chairmen of the
Central Committee are John Morrison, Stan Saulson, and Robert Ware.
Open-House representatives from the Engineering Organization include:
Fred M. Baker, SAE; Walter Bergner, AIEE; Curtis Bottum, Tau Beta Pi-
Physics; Gerard Giczewski, ROTC Signal Corps; Edwin Imu, AIME; Don-
ald Perkins, Radio Club; Floyd Preston, AIChE; William Scheef, ASCE;
Ben Selving, Photography; Karl Stevens, IAeS; Roy McPherson, Quarter-
deck, Eugene Sikorovsky, Vulcans—Engineering Mechanics; Tom Stout,
Eta Kappa Nu; and Robert Strader, ASME.

Messom.
Regularly organized tours will be
planned for all those who wish to par-
ticipate. In addition to these planned
trips, information booths will be set
up in both the East and West Engineer-
ing Buildings, to aid those who would
prefer to visit the displays independ-
ently.

of five or six people. Movies will be
shown at a central location all day. It
is hoped souvenirs will be available.
radio and electricity
The American Institute of Electrical
Engineers' Student Branch will have
full charge of the Electrical Engineer-
ing displays, in conjunction with the
University Radio Club.
Walter Bergner and Tom Stout are
the students who will supervise the
exhibit, and they have plans to show
the work of the department in five
major categories: Power and Dynamo
Laboratory, Communication, Electron-
ics, High Voltage Phenomena, and
Illumination. The exhibits will illus-
trate basic principles of Electrical Engi-
neering, and will show practical aspects
and amusing twists of the subject.
In the Communication and Elec-
tronics Display, the following demon-
strations will be given: Seeing Sound
on the Cathode-Ray Oscillograph, Prin-
ciples of Radio and Basic Vacuum Tube
Circuits, Ultra-High Frequency and
Television Techniques. Radar, Tele-
phone Dial System, Photoelectric cell
applications in movie sound systems,
and the University's short wave station
in full operation.

L. Eareckson, Jr., Henry M. Tiede-
mann, John G. German, and S. G. Stian-
son.
In addition to rides for the visitors on
the towing-car of the Naval Tank, and
displays of model hulls used in the test-
ing procedures, the Naval Architecture
drafting room will be opened, and ship
designing methods will be demonstrated.
Static stability of ships will be dem-
onstrated.
physics
Tau Beta Pi will sponsor the Physics
Department's exhibits and the following
men have been appointed to the Physics
Open-House Committee.
Chairman—Curt Bottum
Cyclotron—Roland Ure
Cloud Chamber—Tom Hendrickson
Electron Microscope—George Sawyer
Supersonic Reflectroscope and Rever-
beration Chamber—Dave Whit-
combe
Physics Demonstrations—Ken Alli-
son, Bob Heineman, Don Forman.
The following demonstrations will be
presented in the Randall Laboratory of
Physics.
Cyclotron
The cyclotron bombards objects and
makes them radioactive, splits atoms,
and changes elements to other forms.
It even produces elements not found in
nature, as well as performing such
transmutations as changing platinum
to gold. It is now making radioactive
isotopes for the University Hospital.
Ordinary table salt made radioactive by
the cyclotron greatly aids the study
of heart diseases and high blood pres-
sure when put into the blood stream.
Being radioactive, its path may be
traced through the blood.
The bombardment is done with a 10-
million electron volt beam of deuterons
which will penetrate 64 centimeters of
air. The cyclotron utilizes a 95-ton
electromagnet which develops a field
strength of ten thousand gauss. Because
of the radioactivity it produces, the cy-
clotron is completely surrounded by
water tanks three feet thick. Another
set of water tanks further protects the
operator who is at a control panel.
This machine, built under the direc-
tion of Dr. J. M. Cork about ten years
ago, is constantly being improved with
modern and more powerful equipment.
It has proved invaluable in the study of
nuclear physics.
Synchrotron
The synchrotron or "racetrack," (so
called for its appearance), is now under
construction. It also makes objects
radioactive by bombarding them, but
will be far more powerful than the
cyclotron. The electrons for bombard-
ment are accelerated by a radiofrequen-
cy electric field and held in their orbits
by a slowly increasing magnetic field.
With it, a300-million electron-volt beam
of electrons is produced, contrasted with
the 10-million electron volt beam of
the cyclotron. A model of the com-
pleted synchrotron will be on display.
Reverberation Room
In the third basement is a structure
completely separate from the rest of the
physics building. Its walls are each one
foot from the main building, and even
the steps leading to it from the main
building do not touch it. This room is
used to measure the absorption coeffi-
cient of various materials. Sounds are
uniformly distributed by a large rotor
in the center and their intensity meas-
ured by means of electronic instruments.
This apparatus, devised by Dr. Geiger,
will shortly provide all the accepted
measurements that the entire country
will use.
The Beta-Ray Spectrometer
The Beta-Ray Spectrometer is a de-
vice for the detection and analysis of
radiation from radioactive bodies. Par-
ticles emitted from the substance are
focused in a magnetic field, the focal
point of each particle being determined
by its energy. In this way the intensity
of radiation having a particular energy
can be measured. Such data furnish in-
formation concerning the atom, thus
aiding further research.
Special Effects
Demonstrations and lectures illustrat-
ing the underlying principles of heat,
light, electricity, and mechanics— ex-
planations of the strange effects of
physical phenomena—will be presented
in room 1041 Randall.
It is anticipated that the Detroit
Edison Company will show by displays

department has made in the field of
physics.
Electron Microscope
The electron microscope magnifies
objects 100 thousand times, and there-
fore, for the first time, brings molecules
into actual view. Particles 1/5,000,000
of an inch in diameter can be seen and
photographed.

The electron microscope.
Specimens are illuminated by a beam
of electrons which is focused by electro-
magnetic "lenses." At the top of a six-
foot column is an electron-gun which
accelerates a beam of electrons through
60,000 volts and shoots it down the
column. The electron beam passes
through the specimen which is mounted
in the evacuated column, and then
through the magnetic lenses, which fo-
cus it as an image on the fluorescent
screen at the bottom of the column.
Professor Williams and Dr. Wyckoff
in our Physics Department have de-
veloped a process which gives a re-
markable three-dimensional effect to
photographs taken with the electron mi-
croscope. The actual shape of tiny ob-
jects can be determined by shadows
caused by the retardation of the passage
of electrons by a film of metal on parts
of the specimen.
The physics department has two
R.C.A. electron microscopes used prin-
cipally in the study of bacteriological
and metallurgical problems. It is now
used to study little-known viruses which
cause many human and plant diseases,
and which, until the invention of the
electron microscope, could not be seen.
Wilson Cloud Chamber
In the Wilson cloud chamber the
path of an ionizing particle can be made
visible as a row or "track" of cloud
droplets. Thus the paths of individual
electrons can actually be identified.
By bombarding an object with a
stream of atomic missiles, a particle
knocked out of an object can be traced.
A magnetic field applied to the chamber
permits the charge and energy of the
particle to be deduced from the curva-
ture of its path.
The visibility of the path of an elec-
tron, for example, is accomplished in
the following way: dust-free air satu-
rated with a vapor is expanded in the
cloud-chamber and thereby cooled.
When an electron enters the chamber
it forms an ion in the vapor, the air
around it having become supersaturated
due to cooling. Droplets condense about
the ion from this supersaturated vapor
as the particle moves through the
chamber. Thus a row of condensed
cloud droplets trace the path of the ion.
With the cloud chamber, many
theories have been proved, including the
photoelectric effect, pair formation, and
the Auger effect.
Supersonic Reflectroscope
The supersonic reflectroscope is a ma-
chine for measuring the physical con-
stants of metals at various temperatures.
With it, the modulus of elasticity,
shear modulus, and Poisson's ratio can
be determined accurately. It has solved
the problem of obtaining these constants
at high temperatures, which is not
practical by any other means.
A supersonic wave is sent through
the specimen by applying a vibrating
crystal at one end. Crystals may be used
to send out either compressional or shear
waves. The time required for the wave
to be reflected back from the other end
of the specimen is recorded on a cathode-
ray oscilloscope screen. Knowing the
length of the specimen, an almost direct
calculation may be used to evaluate the
constants.
mechanical
The student branch of the American
Society of Mechanical Engineers will
operate the machines in the M.E. labo-
ratories for the Open-House.
The "Ball" steam engine, a horizon-
tal 25 horsepower unit employing two
flywheels, will be running "wide-open,"
and the Prony Brake will be applied
in power calculations.
A "Doble Hydroelectric Plant," in-
cluding an impulse water turbine, sup-
plying pump, three-phase generator, and
saline resistance bath, will demonstrate
modern use of water power to produce
electrical energy.
The "Corliss" steam engine will drive
a compressor unit, and "indicator cards"
will be taken to show horsepower calcu-
lations from input steam pressure and
piston movement.
A blower pressure unit with a centrif-
ugal pressure blower and a testing duct
will be running, and the variation in air
velocity with "turbulent" flow in the
duct will be measured with a Pitot Tube
apparatus.
A single-cylinder vertical Oil-Engine
with a low compression ratio will be
operating. The unit is about eight feet
high and develops 37 HP.
A moving cutaway model of an air-
craft engine will be demonstrated and
explained, and cutaway automobiles will
be on display.
The chairman of the A.S.M.E. Open-
House committee is Bob Strader, and
members of his group include Doug
Anderson, Al Cherry, Al Arklie, Don
DeFrain, Ivan Gilman, Don Murray,
Lee Smith, Francisco Saravia, Don Al-
ley, Glen Majors, Dick Tarazevich,
Paul Wignall, Mort Riess, John Morri-

The Society of Automotive Engineers
Open-House Committee, under the di-
rection of Fred M. Baker, chairman, has
planned a group of exhibits and dem-
onstrations pertaining primarily to in-
ternal combustion engines. Members of
the committee include William B. Smith,
Robert C. Johnson, John W. Clark,
Wendel E. Young, and Robert Both-
feld.
Displays of particular interest to en-
gineering students are the sound and
vibration studies, spark-ignition test,
and manifold fuel-distribution test.
In addition, exhibits presented will
include a jumbo jet engine, and Allison
supercharger, a tank engine (M-3, Gen-
eral Sherman), and auto and aircraft
engines of many types.
engineering mechanics
The Vulcans Society will be in charge
of the Mechanics Laboratories during
the Open-House, and will demonstrate
machines in the Materials Testing Room
as well as many phenomena in fluid
mechanics.
Tensile, Compression, and Torsion
tests of various materials will show the
public how engineering and industrial
firms check the strength of structural
steel, wood, and concrete, and photo-
elastic stress analysis is to be shown,
using polarized light and plastic models
to demonstrate stress concentration.
In the fluids laboratory airflow past
cars and airfoils will be demonstrated.
navy displays
The Department of Naval Science
and Tactics will set up its more portable
displays in the lobby of the East En-
gineering Building, but its main exhibit
will be located in its Headquarters, at
North Hall.
The Naval representative to the En-
gineering Open-House Committee is
Stan Saulson, who is assisted by Ken
Fox and Melvin Sartin.
An Automatic Rater, similar to a pin-
ball machine, which lights up when the
correct answer to a question is given,
automatically adds up the score, and
displays the question, together with its
correct answer in a glass window, will
be shown in the East Engine Lobby.
Here, too, will be the Navy's wire
recorder, which magnetically records
sound and plays it back as often as de-
sired. This equipment will be operating
for all visitors.

Eight o'clock bolt.
At North Hall, the entire installation,
from the five inch naval gun on the
lawn to the smallest pieces of gear, will
be on display.
A roomful of fire-control apparatus
which can be linked with the gun out-
side the building is one of the facilities
for the Navy's teaching methods. In
addition anti-aircraft installations, sig-
nal bridges, a device for training in the
firing of automatic weapons, with real-
istic sound effects, and other ordnance
equipment will be shown.
Members of the Naval R.O.T.C. unit
will guide visitors through all parts of
the building, pointing out and describ-
ing the very modern classrooms installed
by the Navy, and the various ship mod-

Temple of learning.
els to be seen. Coffee and doughnuts
will be served to visitors in the ward-
room.
army displays
The Army R.O.T.C. unit is prepar-
ing many interesting displays of mili-
tary and engineering equipment. The
Corps of Engineers will show models of
Japanese and American mine sets, a
mine-detection outfit, and water puri-
fication equipment. In addition, a
"Stereo-comparagraph" for viewing
aerial photos in three dimensions, will
be seen by the visitors.
Several General Motors "Ducks," the
Army's amphibian troop-carrying ve-
hicles, will be driven around the Cam-
pus, and may carry visitors for short
rides. These will be furnished by the
Army Transportation Corps.
The Signal Corps exhibit is extensive
and will demonstrate many of the latest
military communication units. An SCR
(Signal Corps Radio) 193, a ground
sending and receiving set, and seven
walkie-talkies will keep the several
R.O.T.C. exhibits in close co-ordination.
Visitors will be able to talk to their
friends on these "transceivers." Several
teletype machines and two switchboards
will also be featured in the display.
The Army Ordnance exhibit will in-
clude one 105 mm gun, 60 and 80 mm
mortars, and 30 to SO caliber machine-
guns, and the Department has requested
a visual gun director and other fire-
control telescopes and equipment, and
also a rubber-treaded tank, which may
not reach Ann Arbor in time for the
Engineering Open-House.
Pi Tau Pi Sigma, the Army Signal
Corps Fraternity, will be operating the
University's short wave broadcasting
station, W8ZUP, in the West Engineer-
ing Building, in conjunction with the
Radio Club.
The Army Air Force ROTC unit in
the Department of Military Science and
Tactics will display a full plane-load
of cutaway engines and instrument
mock-ups, which will be flown into
Willow Run by the Second Air Force.
The Air Force Headquarters has also
been asked to set up a Ground Radar
Unit, which will scan the campus area
and spot training missions of fighter
groups from Selfridge Field, which will
be routed over Ann Arbor for the Open-
House. Several battle films of combat
in the European Theater are scheduled
for showing in one of the Open-House
Movie groups.

east engineering wing
The Engineering College of the Uni-
versity of Michigan is very happy about
the splendid progress being made by
Bryant and Detweiler of Detroit, con-
tractors on the South extension of the
first space addition to the main college
buildings since 1923, when the enroll-
ment in engineering was 1,670. For the
fall semester of 1947, some 4,200 under-
graduate engineers are expected and the
twenty-five classrooms in the new wing
will be needed urgently. In addition to
these rooms, the entire Department of
Electrical Engineering, now scattered
with its units of Dynamo-Power, Pho-
tometry, Electrical Measurements, and
Electronics in four separate places, will
be moved to the new unit. The base-
ment will house the main power supply
room, the instrument and machine shop,
the photometric laboratory, the dy-
namometer laboratory, and three alter-
nating-current dynamo laboratories. The
second floor will contain the electrical
department staff offices and laboratories
in servo-mechanisms, rectifiers, induc-
tion heating and relays. The third and
fourth floors are devoted mainly to elec-
tronics and communications with a flat
roof available for antenna research.

Construction under way on the new East Engineering Wing. Since
this picture was taken the exterior has been virtually completed.
Aeronautical Engineering will share
in the new space, utilizing the first floor
for staff offices and vibrations laborato-
ry with a structural laboratory in the
basement and an aerodynamic laborato-
ry on the fourth floor.
slide-rule ball
Sponsored by The Michigan Technic,
the eighteenth annual Slide Rule Ball
will come as an exciting climax to the
Engineering Open-House. One thousand
couples will dance to the music of Bob
Strong and his orchestra. Traditionally
regarded as a strictly engineering affair,
the dance this year has been opened to
the whole campus just as the engineer-
ing college will be open to public inspec-
tion for the first time since the war.
Although the Slide Rule Ball has al-
ways been one of the big formals of the
year on the Michigan campus, the com-
mittee this year has billed the dance as
"formal-optional" in order that men
caught by the shortage of formal attire
would not be discouraged about attend-
ing the dance. Women will receive late
permission, as the dance will last from
9 to 1 a.m.
Midsemester examinations will not
keep the dance committee from making
this Slide Rule Ball the most colorful
of a long series. The decoration motif,
although engineering in nature, will be
of general interest. Decorations will in-
clude several mammoth slide rules and
T-squares, a tremendous blueprint and
revolving gears.
In order to make it possible for all
students to attend, the dance commit-
tee has set up two special services. One
will secure late busses to Willow Run
to accommodate students living at Wil-
low Village. The other will provide
married couples who have children with
the names and addresses of baby-sitters
who will be available for homes in the
Village and Ann Arbor.
The dance committee selected Bob
Strong and his orchestra for the Slide
Rule Ball because of "an excellent repu-
tation for smooth, yet distinctive, dance
music throughout the midwestern col-
lege circuit." Bob Strong reversed the
usual procedure for new dance bands
by starting as a radio conductor on
commercial broadcasts and then taking
his band out on the midwestern and
eastern ballroom tours.
Featured with Strong, who is now
recognized as having one of the leading
college bands, will be Jo Ann Talley
and Don Bailey, vocalists, and Johnny
Carroll, trumpeter.
The Slide Rule Ball Committee in-
cludes: Milt David and Jack Kelso,
general co-chairmen; Henry Kaminski,
business; Robert Ware, Cedric Fricke,
Ernest Harper, and Betty Hansen, dec-
orations; C. Phillip Stemmer, band;
Don Skilliter and Lexie Herrin, tickets;
Marilyn Marsh and Stan Saulson, pro-
grams; Mary Pat King, patrons; and
John Campbell and James Chandler,
publicity.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC

What is CV?
CV is the answer to a tough problem. It stands for
Continuous Vulcanization—a process developed by
Western Electric engineers to speed-up and improve
production of rubber-insulated telephone wire. It
proved so efficient a process that more than thirty
outside manufacturers have introduced CV into
their plants.

Under previous methods, the rubber compound
was fed by hand into a forcing or tubing machine
which extruded it upon the wire. The conductor
with this unvulcanized covering was coiled in pans
in a layer of powdered soapstone and sifted chalk,
with each flat coil separated from its neighbor by
another layer of soapstone and chalk. The insulated
wire in the soapstone and pan was afterwards placed
in a steam vulcanizing oven and cured for approxi-
mately 45 minutes. An additional reeling or coiling
operation was required and the complete process
took from one to three hours depending on the in-
sulation wall thickness.
Now the continuous insulating and vulcanizing
machine—developed and built by Western Electric
engineers—does the whole job in one operation.
Rubber compound and bare wire are both fed con-
tinuously into one end of the machine and then
through steam at high pressure which cures the
rubber insulation in approximately 7 seconds. The
insulated wire is taken up on reels in continuous
lengths up to 30,000 feet in a fraction of the time
required under the old panning process.
Halving the steps on Step-by-Step
Simplifying production of over 1,000,000 Step-by-
Step "banks" per year—for use in dial telephone
exchanges—gave Western Electric engineers an in-
teresting assignment.
One of several types of "banks" consists of 200
brass terminals, assembled in 10 levels, the termi-
nals of each level accurately positioned on a crescent
shaped phenol fibre insulator which separates them
from the next level. The entire assembly occupies a
space of but 4J^" x 2J4" x llA"- Initially, banks
were made in ten steps: (1) spray varnish on phenol
fibre strips; (2) punch insulators from these strips;
(3) punch individual terminals from coils of brass
sheet; (4) assemble a preliminary pileup, picking up
each terminal by hand,—200,000,000 per year, and
accurately positioning it on the varnished insulator;
(5) bake; (6) compress to secure terminals to var-
nished surface of insulators and then dismantle pre-
liminary pileup; (7) make final assembly, inserting
additional insulators and spacers; (8) bake; (9)
compress and tighten clamping screws; (10) cut off
excess length of screws and line ream mounting holes.

Western Electric engineers streamlined these ten
steps into five: (1) punch insulators from unvarnished
phenol fibre strips; (2) punch terminals, leaving
them connected to each other, and wind into rolls;
(3) automatically separate terminals from roll and
eyelet to insulators in punch press equipped with
dial feed tools; (4) make final bank assembly; (S)
compress and tighten clamping screws.
Results—a 30% reduction in manufacturing cost,
an improvement in quality, and more economical
utilization of manpower and facilities.
Manufacturing telephone and radio apparatus for the Bell System is Western Electric's primary job. It calls
for engineers of many kinds — electrical, mechanical, industrial, chemical, metallurgical — who devise
and improve machines and processes for large scale production of highest quality communications equipment.

TECHNIC
PRESENTS
e.e. prof.
Professor Alfred Lovell of the Elec-
trical Engineering Department is with-
out question one of the most distin-
guished personalities on the University
of Michigan campus. Professor Lovell's
name is associated with many engineer-
ing concerns throughout the United
States and Canada. His achievements
and accomplishments in the field of elec-
trical power engineering have earned a
place among the noted engineers of his
time as well as a permanent spot in
"Who's Who in Engineering."
As a young man, in 1905, after three
years of construction work with the On-
tario Power Company at Niagara Falls,
Professor Lovell made his appearance
on the Michigan campus and enrolled
in the College of Engineering. His ar-
dent desire to be a specialist in the field
of electrical power engineering helped
him endure the trials and tribulations of
a student in the early 1900's. In 1909,
Professor Lovell received a B.S. in E.E.
and left to work for the Rochester Gas
and Electric Company and the contrac-
tor on the Hydro Power Commission
Steel Tower Lines. In 1911, he returned
as an instructor to the University and
three years later was awarded a Mas-
ter's Degree in E.E. After spending
twenty months with engineer regiments
in World War I, Professor Lovell again
returned and was awarded a full profes-
sorship on the University engineering
staff. Since then, he has served for
fourteen years as assistant dean in the
College of Engineering, and in 1945 was
appointed chairman of the electrical en-
gineering department.
Even though Professor Lovell has
taught engineering for almost forty
years, he has not lost sight of the prac-
tical aspects and applications of en-
gineering in industry. He has spent con-
siderable time on research projects and
has acted as consulting engineer to in-
dustry. Research on elevator motor
drives, field inspections of power sta-
tions and sub-stations, and designing of
steam and hydro power plants are a few
of Professor Lovell's accomplishments.
Besides a knowledge of American En-
gineering problems, Professor Lovell has
made an extensive study and inspection
of Italian hydro-electrical plants, and
French and English steam-driven power
plants.
Professor Lovell's scholastic duties
are a great responsibility; however, he
finds time to participate in campus and
outside activities. He is a Fellow of the
A.I.E.E. and has served as national di-
rector and vice-president. He has also
been chairman of various committees of
the "American Society for Engineering
Education." During World War I, Pro-
fessor Lovell served as a Colonel in the
Army Engineers and is now a member
of the University ROTC advisory com-
mittee. Professor Lovell is also the au-
thor of two standards texts in his field:
Economic Elements of Electrical Design
and Generating Stations, which latter
deals with electric power generation.

Alfred H. Lovell
Today, Professor Lovell is busy mak-
ing plans for the move of the E.E. de-
partment to the new South wing of East
Engineering Building. The word comes
from Professor Lovell that the new
building will afford ideal conditions for
study and laboratory work. The third
and fourth floors of the addition will
house the electronics—communications
section, and the roof will be used for
the placement of antennas. Instead of
crowding one hundred students at a
time into one dynamo laboratory, there
will be three AC laboratories and two
DC laboratories to accommodate the
classes.
The new building which is so urgent-
ly needed will gather the present scat-
tered sections of dynamo power, pho-
tometry, electronics, radio, and electrical
measurements together in one assembly.
This will simplify power supply and will
prove beneficial to students as well as
to staff members. Professor Lovell states
that since laboratories will not be as
crowded and additional facilities will be
made available, the teaching efficiency
will be increased and any confusion and
interference between sections will be
eliminated. The moving of equipment
into the laboratories of the new wing
is expected to begin this fall.
G.H.G.
bill
Conscientious and capable is William
A. Hannig in his extra-curricular activi-
ties as well as in his studies. This is
attested to by his achievements along
both lines.
At present, Bill is Chairman of the
AIEE-IRE and Secretary of the En-
gineering Council, which positions ac-
knowledge the quality of his efforts in
extra-curricular activities, while his
membership in Phi Eta Sigma and Tau
Beta Pi are testimonials of his scholastic
ability. In addition. Bill was in charge
of tickets for the Engineering Ball and
was formerly the AIEE representative
to the Engineering Council. Besides par-
ticipating in these activities and doing
well scholastically, Bill has also tried
his hand at teaching. He has taught
E.M. 2a and at present is teaching C.E.
Ill lab. which consists of practical
work in photographic operations.
As Chairman of the student branch of
the AIEE-IRE, Bill has succeeded in
preparing interesting and informative
programs for the meetings and during
his term of office the membership of
that organization has increased by 50%.
He was one of the committee which
drew up the by-laws enabling the mer-
ger of the student branches of the AIEE
and IRE which project has been the
aim of many engineers for a long while.

A LOOK AT THE WORLD
In the past few years the relationship
between science and mankind has be-
come a common topic of conversation
everywhere. Indeed, with the advent
of the atomic bomb, biological warfare,
and rocket projectiles, it has become
almost trite to speak of the important
role science is playing and will continue
to play in our lives. Yet the many
peacetime uses, which scientific and tech-
nological "know-how" are finding in the
betterment of our everyday lives, serve
to remind us that science and tech-
nology of themselves are neither good
nor evil. They are merely the means by
which man can shape his destiny in
whatever way he chooses.
The very fact that science has placed
such power in the hands of man, is not
the only reason why the picture sci-
ence and technology present to the
world today is a compelling and fasci-
nating one. If for no other reason than
to exchange the knowledge and experi-
ence found in one branch of science for
that found in another, the picture is one
of mutual interest and value. The added
satisfaction of seeing the relationship of
the work one is doing in one small
branch of the immense field of technol-
ogy to the whole vast panorama is an-
other aspect that focuses attention on
the situation. Not the least of these is
the study of the effect of modern theory
on the techniques employed in industry
and research.
For this reason let us look at some
of the recent books that have been
written with the view in mind of pro-
viding an overall picture of science and
technology in its various aspects today.
One such book which gives an insight
into the situation that prevailed during
the war is "Science Remakes Our
World," x by James Stokley, present di-
rector of the Fels Planetarium and
connected with General Electric Labora-
tories. This book, which covers such
fields as explosives, fuels, metallurgy,
plastics, light and power, and radio,
presents a comprehensive view of the
research that was being conducted dur-
ing the war and which now is finding
application in filling peacetime needs.
Drawing his information from such
commercial and university laboratories
as those of the Celanese Corp., General
Electric, RCA, MIT, and Columbia, the
author has given a well organized non-
technical presentation of important de-
velopments in each of many fields of
the physical and technical sciences.
In a similar vein, Science Looks
Ahead,- by A. M. Low, is another vol-
ume which attempts to give a compre-
hensive view of the state of science at
the present time and its potentialities
for future development. In this attempt
to show the relationship between the
various sciences, it presents a unique
opportunity for a broad and well bal-
anced view of the entire picture.
Another book by the same author
which should be of especial interest to
engineers is Science in Industry.3 The
attempt here to depict the influence of
scientific research on industrial develop-
ment gives a most valuable insight into
the relationship between the theoretical
and practical phases of technology.
Although primarily concerned with the
English aspects of the situation, the
British idiom is not a hindrance, and
the picture presented is all the more
valuable for its portrayal of a slightly
different economic background. Those
students who have had experience in
industry should find many points of
interest in this presentation.
A most interesting and valuable set of
volumes concerning this subject is a
series called Science in Progress* edited
by Geo. Baitsell. A consecutive publi-
cation of selected lectures given before
the national assembly of Sigma Xi, this
series provides an excellent source of
information of a highly technical nature
coupled with a lucid presentation. An
anthology of the personal summaries of
the aims and achievements of such men
as Isidore Rabi, Walter Miles, V. K.
Zworykin, E. O. Lawrence, and H. C.
Urey, it is one of the most stimulating
sources of fact and exploration in the
realms of modern research develop-
ments that could be desired. Begun in
1939. this compilation has been repeat-
ed by demand several times until it now
comprises four volumes. A true adven-
ture in modern technological and scien-
tific research, it is highly recommended
as a source of information as well as
inspiration to anyone connected with
the field of science.
A final aspect of the picture of tech-
nology in a modern world appears in
the article "Do We Really Need Engi-
neers and Scientists?" 6 by Allan Culli-
more, Pres. of the Newark College of
Engineering. His point, well empha-
sized throughout the article, is that there
is today a very serious shortage of tech-
nically trained men and technical edu-
cators. Although preoccupied with the
need of technology as a national defense
measure, he also treats the broader as-
pects of the social ramifications of
modern technical developments. Perti-
nent statistics are brought in from the
field of education in an attempt to
focus attention upon the problem of
supplying our nation's technical needs
in the future.
There are, of course, many other
phases of the complicated picture we
face when we consider what science has
contributed to society and our way of
life. We have mentioned only a few
of the more important ones here. What
science and technology may bring forth
in the future can only be conjectured.
But it becomes increasingly apparent
that no longer can scientists and tech-
nologists be satisfied to be extreme spe-
cialists in one small branch of the field
only. They must also know something
of what the entire field holds and what
it is presenting to the world at large.
In this way, not only will the scientist
be able to better orient his work, but
he will also be equipped to direct its
use and to understand the situation in
which he, as a member of society, finds
himself.

YOU SEE II YflM NEIGHBOR?
T
|RENTON BY ORIGIN is a crossroads—a community of people drawn together from
the four corners of the earth by any one of a number of attractions.
Being a part of this growing neighborhood is a responsibility, for its interests are your
interests—its friends, your friends—its enemies, your enemies.
There was a time when cities like Trenton were protected against attack by great walls
and strong gates. Today's assailants cannot be kept out by such primitive methods.
They come into our midst like invisible Trojan horses, and their only weapons are
theories and glib tongues.
Disguised as friends, they reveal themselves only after they have assembled enough
followers to attack from within; when it is too late for us to do anything about it
Their methods are simple: They work with us, agree with our ideals, and sympathize
with our troubles. When they have won our confidence, when they have succeeded in
getting themselves appointed to committees, and elected to offices... they turn upon us.
Like the amiable tourists, who suddenly donned enemy uniforms, during the last war,
they attack when we least expect it. . when we are helpless against them. They usually
begin by labeling our time-tried leaders with names which insure their downfall—but
which describe the intruders best—and having succeeded in ousting our leaders, they
take over.
Is it too late to do what stone walls and strong gates could not do? Do we want these
dangerous men in our country, in our clubs, in our unions, in our businesses and in
our government?
Let the man who wants to hold office identify himself. Let the man who wants to live
with us and work with us, reveal his purpose. Let the man who wants to have a voice
in our affairs, disclose his ambitions and ideals
It is our duty to know our neighbors. We only can trust them when we do. "Good
fences make good neighbors" and good neighbors make good cities—good governments
— good unions—good businesses—good citizens.

man-made weather
Technically, it may be spring, but at
the General Electric Research Labora-
tory it is still winter. There they are
literally snowed under, with artificial
snow. Man-made snow was produced
for the first time just recently and the
scientists have been progressing steadily
with its development since.
Natural clouds from which snow is
produced consist of supercooled water
droplets. These liquid water droplets
are not frozen although their tempera-
ture may be down to —31 degrees Fahr-
enheit. When the temperature falls be-
low —31 degrees, snow is formed spon-
taneously. However, natural snow is
also formed at higher temperatures. Be-
cause of this fact, scientists believed
that nature often uses artificial nuclei to
produce snow. Through experiment,
some of the materials which could be
used as artificial nuclei for producing
snow were found to be silver iodide, lead
iodide, iodo-form, iodine crystals, apa-

tite, nephelite, wurtzite, zincite, and
cerium oxide.
In the first laboratory experiments
with man-made snow, a supercooled
cloud was created in a cold chamber
kept at a temperature of about —5 de-
grees Fahrenheit. Then the cloud was
"seeded" by passing a tiny pellet of dry
ice through the chamber. As this pellet
of dry ice at a temperature of —78 de-
grees Fahrenheit passed through the
moist air, submicroscopic condensation
nuclei were created near its surface.
These nuclei were probably spherical
droplets of supercooled water at first.
But they soon froze and developed as
ice crystals. Once the formation of
these ice particles was started, the crys-
tals began growing at the expense of
the water particles in the cloud until
within a few seconds, tiny snowflakes
were formed. These snowflakes were
about 1,000 times larger than the origi-
nal ice crystal seeds, but were only 1/50
the size of the average natural snow-
flake.
In a method developed later, artificial
nuclei were used instead of natural ice
nuclei. In this method, the supercooled
water droplets in the cloud are "fooled"
into crystallizing on foreign particles
substituted for the natural ice nuclei.
Each of the foreign nuclei has a crystal
structure which is very similar to that
of natural ice. This similarity is able to
make the water droplets change to snow
by using the foreign nuclei to start the
growth. Because most of these artificial
nuclei act at a much higher temperature
than is necessary for ice nuclei to form
spontaneously, their discovery is very
important. Also, because these artificial
nuclei do not melt or evaporate like ice
nuclei, they may be sent into the atmos-
phere by generators on the ground, to
remain there until they produce snow.
From the laboratory, man-made snow
graduated into a direct competition with
mother nature. The first attempt to
produce snow from a natural cloud was
made before the discovery of the arti-
ficial nuclei. A plane was flown through
the cloud while six pounds of dry ice
pellets were scattered over a section
about three miles long. The cloud re-
action was very rapid. Within two min-
utes streamers of snow began to pour
from the base of the cloud. Although
the cloud was a stratus type, pillars of
cumulus cloud started to rise from its
top. The heat which is generated by
the freezing of the water droplets in the

Essentially, photography is as simple

so popular with young and old alike.
That is also why photography is so

Nowadays, to reproduce complex

with Transfax, lay your drawing over
it... and let light do the rest.
To make photographically accurate
copies of checks, waybills, sales tickets,

feed the documents into a Recordak.
Light automatically records them for

WHAT'S INSIDE
HOOVER'S
ENGINEERING
DEPARTMENT?
There's more engineering to the job
of staying in first place with any
home appliance than meets the eye
... so we've cross-sectioned the
Hoover Engineering Department's
modern 4-story building to show you.
It's "big-time" engineering.
More than 130 skilled people, a
third of them graduate engineers,
staff this Hoover "idea factory." We
call it that because in doing a thor-
ough job of planning and proving
the Hoover Cleaner, Hoover engi-
neers come up with developments,
new ideas that find wide application
in other industries—many of them
far removed from the home appli-
ance field.

velocity of light) this, in effect means
that a constant frequency electric accel-
erator will again do the job, and the
electron will remain in step with it.
Such machines employing a varying
magnetic field and an electric accelera-
tor of about constant frequency are
called synchrotrons. The synchrotron
was conceived during the war by two
physicists, V. Veksler in Russia, and E.
M. McMillan in the United States.
Neither of them knew of the other's
work until after the war. The racetrack,
now being built at the University of
Michigan, is based upon the synchro-
tron principle, but it contains a num-
ber of new features. It was designed by
Professor D. M. Dennison and myself
about a year ago, and is now in the
construction stage. The project is being
supported by the Bureau of Ordnance
of the United States Navy.
Referring to the picture of the model
of the racetrack, the main features one
sees are (1) the electromagnet, which is
in four 90 degree sectors (2) the injec-
tion apparatus, which is the three story
glass tower, (3) the electric accelerating
"cavity" which resembles a squirrel
(Continued from page 9)
cage, but which, in actual size would be
better suited to airdales, and (4) the
glass vacuum tube in which the elec-
trons move. It is shaped like a very
thin doughnut, and it passes around
through the center of the magnet. Now
let us follow an electron through the
machine. The electron comes from a hot
filament at the top of the injection tube
and is brought up to 85% the speed
of light in the injection tube. It is then
deflected into the horizontal plane and
started on its way around the "dough-
nut." Each time it passes through the
"squirrel cage" it receives another for-
ward push. The magnetic field grows
stronger as the electron gains energy,
so that the ever increasing centrifugal
force is always balanced by the inward
magnetic force and the radius of the
path is held constant. Round and round
it goes for 450,000 laps. This takes just
1/80 of a second, and at the end of
that time the electron is deflected so
that it strikes the target material. The
energy of the electron will be the same
as if it had fallen through a potential
difference of 300,000,000 volts.
Now let me be quick to qualify a few
points. The description has been given,
for simplicity, in terms of accelerating
one electron, while actually a whole
cloud of electrons will travel around the
doughnut at one time. For lack of space
I have left unmentioned other equally
important machines, such as the beta-
tron and the microwave linear accelera-
tor. I have also not discussed the all-
important question of how we will
persuade the electrons to travel the in-
credible distance of some 2000 miles in-
side a 3 inch glass tube without stray-
ing so far from the center as to strike
the wall. The complete solution of the
latter problem was given by both Vek-
sler and McMillan and in fact one might
say that it was the solution of this
which really constituted the invention of
the synchrotron.
The construction of the racetrack
presents many challenging problems,
both in physics and in engineering, A
group of about 20 people, mostly grad-
uate students, has been working on the
design and construction of the machine
for nearly a year, and it is expected that
another year will be required for the
remaining construction.

PROBLEM—You have an aircraft radio receiver. To operate it,
the band selector and tuning elements must be adjusted. You
want to arrange it so that these adjustments can be made right
at the receiver or from a remote point. How would you do it?
THE SIMPLE ANSWER—Use S. S. White remote control flexible
shafts to connect the tuning dials on the receiver to tuning cranks
on a remote control unit. This arrangement leaves you free tc
mount the control unit anywhere you want, and assures you of
smooth, sensitive tuning from any distance up to 50 feet or more.
The shafts can be readily run
around turns, along walls, under
flooring as conditions in different
aircraft may require. Any re-
quired degree of sensitivity can
be obtained by connecting the
shaft through simple gearing.
This is just one of hundreds of
remote control and power drive
problems to which S. S. White flex-
ible shafts provide a simple answer.
That's why every engineer should
be familiar with the range and
scope of these "Metal Muscles"*
for mechanical bodies.

turer provided

as sputtering, which entails the use of
an electric arc.
In the pressure region where the
mean free path of the gas molecules is
comparable to the vessel dimensions,
very careful gas flow considerations are
necessary. In this region the impedance
to flow is inversely proportional to the
third power of the diameter. For the
necessary mass flow the volumetric
flow must be extremely large and the
impedance as small as possible. There-
fore, short, large diameter pipes with
a minimum of bends and valves should
be used.

Among the various pressure-measur-
ing devices available, the most com-
monly used in commercial systems are
the McLeod gauge, the thermocouple
and Pirani gauges, and the ionization
gauge. The McLeod gauge measures
pressures from 10* to 5 mm, and is
manually operated. In this type, a large
known volume of gas is compressed to
a smaller known volume. The pressure
required to compress this gas is a meas-
ure of the unknown pressure, the cali-
bration being calculated from the di-
mensions of the gauge.
The Pirani or thermocouple gauge,
with a range of 10~* to 1 mm, depends
upon the physical principle that the
thermal conductivity of a gas is propor-
tional to the pressure exerted upon it,
when the gas layer is of the same order
of magnitude as the mean free path of
the gas in question. The thermal con-
ductivity is measured by determining
the change of resistance or the change
of temperature of a heated filament.
With increasing thermal conductivity
caused by a higher external pressure,
the heat is more readily conducted away
from the filament. This cooling effect
may be measured in two ways. In the
thermocouple method, a thermocouple is
attached directly to the filament's sur-
face and the change of temperature is
recorded by instruments, which may be
direct reading once the thermocouple

Items of Interest to Students of Science and Engineering
Research Problems in the Manufacture of Nylon
Last month in this space the develop-
ment of nylon was traced from a funda-
mental research study on linear polymers
to the first synthetic organic fibers, the
superpolyamides. This installment deals
with the complex manufacturing re-
search problems that followed.
From the start there were obstacles
to the production on a commercial scale
of the "66" polymer—so named because
the adipic acid and hexamethylenedia-
mine from which it is made have six
carbon atoms each.
Although adipic acid was being pro-
duced in Germany, it was necessary to
develop a new process to meet conditions
at Du Pont's Belle, W.Va., plant, where,
because of the catalytic technique in-
volved, it was decided to make this
intermediate. Hexamethylenediamine
was only a laboratory curiosity, and a
process for its commercial production
had likewise to be worked out. Fortu-
nately it was found that the diamine
could be made from adipic acid by new
catalytic processes. The results of these
investigations may be summarized as
follows:

The synthesis of intermediates was
only part of the problem. Nylon poly-
mer was an entirely new material with
properties different from any previous
synthetic product. It provided the first
example of spinning fiber from a molten
polymer (m.p.263°C) and required en-
tirely different techniques from rayon
spinning. Information was acquired
only by painstaking experimentation at
each step.
Manufacturing Process Outlined
The process as finally developed for the
manufacture of nylon and its fabrica-
tion into yarn may be briefly outlined
as follows:
Nylon salt is heated in an autoclave
with addition of stabilizers to control
molecular weight and viscosity. A long-
chain linear polymer is formed with a
molecular weight of 10,000 or higher.
The melt is converted to solid chips
that are later re-melted and extruded
through a spinneret to form filaments
at a speed of 2,500 feet a minute. The
filaments are then drawn out to about
four times their original length in order
to develop the desired textile qualities
characteristic of nylon.
These operations sound simple
enough, but some of the problems en-
countered were extraordinarily difficult.
For example, a specially designed grid
for melting the polymer was necessary
because of the poor thermal conductiv-
ity of the polymer; pumps had to oper-
ate at 285°C with only polymer as a
lubricant; special abrasion-resistant
steels that did not soften or warp at
285°C were necessary; the spinning as-
sembling required radically new engi-
neering developments to produce the
necessary fiber qualities.
All of these chemical, physical and
mechanical engineering problems had
to be solved and dove-tailed into a uni-
fied process before manufacture of ny-
lon could be undertaken. In all, about
230 technical men and eight manufac-
turing and staff departments share the
credit for making nylon the important
part of American life it is today.

plished fact.
Bill is a native of New York City,
and was graduated from Bronx High
School of Science in June of 1943. He
is not sure of his plans after he receives
his Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engi-
neering this June, but thinks he will re-
main here to work for his Master's
degree.
He has operated his own darkroom
for the last six or seven years and
prizes his collection of black and white
prints and Kodachrome slides, many of
which were taken on a trip through
Wisconsin and upper Michigan last
summer.
Bill has combined all of these campus
interests to try to find that field for
which he is best suited. To test the
teaching possibility, Bill taught E.M. 2a
for a semester. Realizing that he did
not have the proper background for
this course, he decided to try teaching
some subject in which he had a better
store of information. This led to his
teaching C.E. Ill lab. He had taken
the course as an elective and thus real-

ized that it was a better trial of his
teaching capabilities. He has gained
some considerable pleasure and assur-
ance doing this and is therefore consid-
ering teaching as an alternative to en-
gineering.

William A. Hannig
The technical subject Bill enjoyed
most was E.E. 160, a course in electrical
design. He appreciated the idea of the
method of attacking a design problem,
that is, more of an empirical method
than the popular conception of an exact
theoretical method.
Bill is an ardent supporter of the
Honor System and says that despite the
opposing comments of some other en-
gineering students, he has seen very
little violation and that which he has
seen was stopped immediately. He vol-
unteered the slightly prejudiced com-
ment, that perhaps the E.E.'s are just
a little more honest than some of the
other engineering students.

Lots of people like to play jack rabbit. Still, as a way of
going to work every morning, we don't see much of a
future for Pogo Sticks. Not even aluminum Pogo Sticks.
But mention any other means of locomotion or trans-
portation and our aluminum "Imagineers" get a gleam
in their eyes. After all, what is more logical than
vehicles made of aluminum? Less weight to move.
More payload.
We turned our imagination loose on that idea years
ago ... then engineered our thinking into trains, trucks,
planes, ships. Alcoa's Development Division has a staff
of "Imagineers" who think of nothing else but better
ways to transport people, products, and materials by
using aluminum. Actually, we have four separate staffs
of transportation engineers, one each on railroads, high-
way vehicles, ships and aircraft.
Whatever you do after college, you'll benefit from
that. If you go into transportation, these Alcoa engi-
neers will be working with you to cut costs, speed
schedules, improve facilities. Or if you choose some
field of production, they'll be helping to transport
your materials and finished goods cheaper and faster.

is also an active member of the
A.I.E.E. and the Union Staff. While
compiling this impressive list of activi-
ties, he found time to participate in the
activities of the University marching
band for two years as well as to main-
tain and excellent scholastic record.
Born and raised in Highland Park
Michigan, Russ came here in November
of 1944 after a year and a half at High-
land Park Junior College. He will grad-
uate in June with the degree of Bachelor
of Science in Electrical Engineering.
Russ' special interest lies in the field
of communications, and at present he
is the possessor of a first class radio-
telephone license. His interest may be
traced back to his days in Junior High
when a mail order catalog of radio parts
fell into his hands. He ordered several
booklets on radio for a few cents and
after a little reading he set about build-
ing a one tube receiver. He used to
listen to "hams" which further aroused
his interest.
When he reached High School he
joined the Radio Club and obtained his

second class radio-telephone license in
the summer of 1943. Shortly after that
he received his first class license in
March of 1944.

MB
Russell A. Shields
Russ gained quite a bit of practical
experience during his summer vacations.
In the summer of 1944 and 1945 he
worked at WJLB in Detroit as engineer
and operator. He spent the summer of
1945 at the sister F.M. station, WLOU,
serving as announcer and operator or
what is better known as a "disk jock-
ey." The vacation of 1943 was spent as
an inspector at a plant manufacturing
beacon receivers for the Air Forces.
Russ believes that the Engineering
curriculum should be extended to give
the Engineering student a broader back-
ground. He believes that the Engineer
should see his place in society from a
broad point of view instead of just be-
ing prepared to go out into industry and
be a "thinking machine" that works
without realizing the ultimate end and
social significance of his work In line
with his belief, in order to broaden his
outlook, Russ is at present sitting in on
the lectures of several courses in Lit
school in addition to the six he is taking
for credit in the Engineering college.
Russ intends to come back here after
graduation but is not sure as yet wheth-
er he will study Business Administration
or work on his Masters degree in E.E.
The leading possibility at present is a
combination of the two.

the pillars of cumulus cloud that ap-
peared at the top. This turbulence also
enabled the process to draw more mois-

the snow formation as a type of chain
reaction.
It was estimated that a single pellet
of dry ice, about the size of a pea, would
produce 300,000 tons of snow if it were
completely utilized. However, this com-
plete utilization cannot be attained be-
cause an ice particle less than a mil-

evaporate even if water is present. In
order to produce large amounts of snow
on the ground, a continuous flow of
moisture into the cloud area is neces-
sary. Where only a few isolated clouds
are present, the method will have a
tendency to dissipate them rather than
to form more.

they were barely visible. So much mois-

Why some things get better all the time

Hoop skirts and prince Alberts are only fond memo-
ries now. Far smarter the styles of today . . . and equally
striking are the constant improvements in the quality of
clothing.
There now are beautiful synthetic fabrics, in stunning
variety—all made possible by chemistry. And woolens, cot-
tons and other fabrics are processed and dyed more effec-
tively—thanks to special new chemicals, and equipment of
stainless steel. There are eye-catching hat decorations,
smartly styled footwear, buttons, belts and suspenders of
colorful long-life plastics. And rainwear of vinyl plastics
provides new comfort and protection in stormy weather.
Clothing for just about any occasion is today more at-
tractive and more serviceable than ever before ... because
it is made of things that are basically better.
Producing better basic materials for the use of science
and industry and the benefit of mankind is the work of
Union Carbide.
Basic knowledge and persistent research are required,
particularly in the fields of science and engineering. Work-
ing with extremes of heat and cold—frequently as high as
6000° or as low as 300° below zero, Fahrenheit—and with
vacuums and great pressures, Units of UCC now separate
or combine nearly one-half of the many elements of the
earth.

Photomicrographs of cold-chamber snow crystals.
Courtesy General Electric
To date, the formation of snow
through the use of artificial nuclei has
been almost entirely a laboratory proc-
ess. In experiments with silver iodide,
a string coated with silver iodide was
first passed through a high temperature
flame which changed the silver iodide
into a gas. A jet of air diluted the gas
so that an invisible "smoke" of small
silver iodide crystals was formed. This
"smoke" was introduced into a super-
cooled cloud formed in a cold chamber,
and the water droplets crystalized on
the silver-iodide nuclei resulting in the
formation of snow.
One of the new automatic weather
studying devices is known as the cloud
meter. The cloud meter consists of a
tiny porous cup mounted on the end of
a tube. Because of its small size, it
acts as a very efficient collector of the
minute liquid cloud particles. These col-
lected particles pass into an electric
counting device. Simultaneously, the
cloud's air velocity is measured, from
which the cloud area can be determined.
Thus, knowing the cloud area and the
number of particles per cubic meter,
the liquid-water content of the entire
cloud can be obtained.

Few people are aware of the extent to
which America's 140,000 miles of pipe-
lines solve the problem of distributing
the vast quantities of oils, gasoline, ker-
osene and industrial fluids necessary to
the life of this nation. The 421,000 pro-
ducing oil wells in 24 states alone ac-
count for more than 4,750,000 barrels
per day, an amount larger than the rest
of the world combined. By adding to
this the output of 411 active refineries
in 36 states, who must move 3,500,000
barrels daily, the magnitude of this
moving job becomes larger still.
The actual piping comprises only a
relatively small investment, compared
with the pumping equipment and stor-
age equipment operated in conjunction
with the pipelines. For example, in a
12-inch pipeline across level country,
where pumping stations are 40 miles
apart, each station must push 4,200 tons
of oil at the rate of three-and-one-half
miles per hour, for a total thrust of 45
tons. Squat silver mushroom-like stor-
age tanks may dot the countryside and
cause questions to be raised in the

there is a "gap" in the schedule by
which the transport facilities of the
lines are most efficiently utilized.
Since one stream of oil closely follows
another—there being no physical barrier
separating the end of one stream from
the head of the next stream—very exact
timing must be employed to enable ter-
minal operators to close the big valves
which divert the flow from the line to
any one of a number of storage tanks.
Knowing the mass rate of flow, the ap-
proximate time required for a definite
amount of oil may be estimated. How-
ever, since the timing must be more ex-
act, samples are taken at terminal points
every ten minutes, and the progress of
the stream is telegraphed to the opera-
tor at the far end, and when the proper
gravity reading is obtained, the huge
valves grind open, filling the proper
"mushroom." Since the API gravities of
the oils fed through these lines may
vary widely, the pumping characteristics
vary similarly, and in addition, the
temperature variations necessitate care-
ful regulation of the pumping speeds.
Since as little as one-half of one per-
cent of heavy "bottom" crudes may ren-
der a fine lubricating oil much less de-
sirable, some means must be provided

of the deposits of sludge. This is done
with an ingenious device known to the
trade as a ''go-devil." A mechanism
comprising blades, spurs, and finned
wheels, the "go-devil" is forced through
the line just ahead of a shipment of fine
quality oil. This keeps the sediment
and scrapings, released from the in-
terior of the pipe, in motion ahead of
the better oil.
It is, of course, impossible to com-
pletely isolate various fractions from
each other as they pass through the
pipelines, because of the tendency of
the adjacent fractions to intermix in
turbulent flow. Utilizers of the petro-
leum products make ample provision for
this difficulty, through the use of stor-
age tanks, to which the extraneous
material may settle out or be decanted.
The recent sale of the Big Inch and
Litttle Big Inch pipelines by the govern-
ment to private interests recalls the tre-
mendous part those tubes had in com-
pensating for the heavy losses inflicted
upon American tanker shipments on
the Atlantic. Special military teams laid
arteries across every continent for the
purpose of keeping America's military
might at top fighting capacity. Since
the cost of pipeline transmission is low
in comparision with rail charges, the
future of the subterranean oil transmis-
sion system seems assured.
silver plating
The accidental use of a silver plated
wire in cleaning phosphor bronze elec-
trolytically has given birth to a new
polishing process that may revolutionize
the silver industry.
Cyanide was the chief factor in the
chance happening that led to the dis-
covery. This was added to an electro-
cleaning solution when dime-size phos-
phor bronze diaphragms for microwave
tubes proved particularly difficult to
wash. One of the diaphragms had been
suspended in the bath, through which
an alternating current was passing, by
a strand of wire previously used to im-
merse some object being silver plated.
The wire was a dull white in appear-
ance as silver plating always is before
polishing. But when the phosphor
bronze diaphragm was lifted from the
solution the wire had taken on a high
luster.
Metal articles to be silver plated are
immersed in a bath of silver cyanide
plating solution and negative current
sent through, causing a deposit of pure

reputation among authorities as one of
the ten most important developments
of the past decade. And here's why:
1. Carboloy commonly triples fhe

removed from the bath, they are evenly
plated with silver but are white and
have no luster. They must be buffed by
hand on a revolving wheel treated with
some sort of buffing compound to im-
part the necessary shine. Buffing not
only entails extra handling of every
piece but also the loss of a certain pro-
portion of the silver through abrasion.
With the new method, the silver
plated object is immersed in a bath of
silver cyanide solution normal to the
regular plating operation. Instead of
sending negative current through as in
plating, however, positive current is ap-
plied in about four times the amperage
used to plate the metal, but not continu-
ously. The positive energy is applied
for a few seconds, discontinued, then
sent through again, and this intermittent
action repeated for several cycles. When
the article has reached its peak of luster,
it is taken out of its bath, rinsed, and
dried. The entire operation takes little
more than a minute.

His genius would have been futile without hard work
The "Orukter Amphibolos"* was more
than a curiosity in 1803. An amphibious
dredge, it began a new era — the mech-
anization of contracting industries. Its
greatest claim to renown came from its in-
ventor, Oliver Evans. First to design a
high pressure steam engine, he built en-
gines for pumping and hoisting, invented
the elevator, conveyor, descender and the
hopper for flour mills. But his foremost
genius was for conscientious work... with
that he made new industries possible.
American creative genius would have
been futile without management ability
and honest toil to develop our industries.
This nation has become a beacon of hope
for the world because sound management
and conscientious work have together
turned scarcity into abundance. We'll
have that abundance in greater measure
only if everyone realizes that even ma-
chines won't produce without an honest
day's work to keep them going.

WELCOME TO OPEN HOUSE
Since 1913, when the first "Annual
Exhibit" was held at the University
of Michigan for the general public,
Open - House demonstrations have
been organized every three or four
years until 1941, when the Ninth
Engineering Open-House was carried
through with great success. At that
time, war clouds were already gather-
ing and, in less than three years,
the student body was decimated sev-
eral times over by recurring draft
calls until very few men were left on
campus to carry on the Engineering
College's grand traditions. Today,
however, the war has been fought
and won, and men are streaming by
the thousands back to the campus.
With their return they have brought
back all the ideas and energies nec-
essary to excel Michigan's pre-war
size and activity.
Accordingly, they have organized
the first post-war technical exhibi-
tion, the 1947 Engineering Open-
House, tenth in the series begun in
1913. The engineering students have
proudly announced the Open-House
for April 18, and we extend a hearty
welcome to all the visitors to this
year's exhibition.
High school and undergraduate
students will have a chance to see
many interesting engineering demon-
strations which will arouse their tech-
nical interests and which may help
them to fix upon a particular phase
of engineering for their life-work.
The general public will have their
best opportunity to see how science
and engineering techniques combine
to bring forth the products which
have made living easier and much
more comfortable for us. Alumni,
particularly, will want to see how
their respective colleges and the
University in general have grown
and matured since their collegiate
days.
The closing theme for the 1941
Open-House was—"We hope that, in
a few years, you will return to an-
other Open-House, to see an even
larger and better equipped College of
Engineering." The 1947 theme is—
"Michigan engineers have proved
themselves successful in all phases of
engineering. Throughout the years,
the College has grown from a four-
room establishment to one of Amer-
ica's greatest engineering institutions
and is at present embarked on its
most ambitious program of research
and expansion. People everywhere are
invited to visit the campus on April
18, to see this growing organism in
action, to get a first-hand glimpse
of Michigan's contributions to engi-
neering science and mass-production
methods, and to see many research
products which were only recently
taken off the 'secret' list."
In carrying out the Open-House,
the Engineering College will throw
all its doors open on the 18th, sus-
pending classes for a day, in order
that the students and faculty will be
able to turn their attention to man-
ning the exhibits. In the evening,
climaxing the days activities, the
MICHIGAN TECHNIC is sponsor-
ing the 18th annual Slide-Rule Ball,
the engineers' formal dance, to be
held at Waterman Gymnasium.
The Open-House Committee, an-
nouncing their completed plans for
the displays, have organized exhibi-
tions from each department of the
* Engineering College. Chemical En-
gineering has made plans for a
petroleum fractionating demonstra-
tion, illustrations of engineering meas-
urements, industrial unit operations,
and many others; the Electrical En-
gineering Department will have ex-
hibits of the most modern equipment
developed during the war, including
radar and television units, besides a
complete array of communications,
electronics, high-voltage, and lighting
developments; the Naval Tank will
be operated in testing ship models.
The Automotive Laboratories will
be open to public view and will in-
clude a jet engine, supercharger, a
tank engine, and various auto and
aircraft engines.
The Naval R.O.T.C. unit will dis-
play their modern equipment used in
the war and which is now being
utilized for training purposes. Fire-
control apparatus, a Wire-Recorder,
anti-aircraft installations and other
ordnance units will be included. The
Army R.O.T.C. will have a Signal-
Corps field-day, with their walkie-
talkies and additional radio equip-
ment. Also, Army transport and ord-
nance units will be on campus for
general view, and units from the
Corps of Engineers will complete the
R.O.T.C. exhibit.
At Willow Run airport, several
large aircraft will be on view. The
high spot of the Aeronautics displays
will be the new laboratories located
at Willow Run airport, where super-
sonic tests are currently being plan-
ned.
Members of the Society of Women
Engineers will provide guide serv-
ice for periodic tours of the Open-
House displays. Busses to Willow
Run will run each half-hour to take
guests to the Aero-demonstrations.
Refreshments will be served at the
Naval R. O. T. C. headquarters at
North Hall.
The Committee, you can see, have
made elaborate plans for a complete,
interesting and educational Open-
House. Our efforts will be justified
by a large attendance on the 18th,
and we urge everyone interested to
plan to spend most of the day seeing
the Open-House exhibits. We wel-
come you, knowing that you will be
favorably impressed with Michigan's
post-war campus, and we hope that
the ensuing years will produce a big-
ger and better College of Engineering,
providing more and better men to
serve the public interests.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Chemical Engineering is that branch of engineering con-
cerned with the development and application of manufacturing
processes in which chemical or certain physical changes of ma-
terials are involved." It is distinguished from the other branches
of engineering in that the Chemical Engineer must be capable
of dealing with chemical energy in all its forms. For this rea-
son the Chemical Engineer must carry the additional burden of
a strong program in Chemistry, as well as the other basic sci-
ences common to all branches of engineering.
Industrial operations arc broken down into unit functions
and studied in the form of unit operations, each of which is
common to many industrial processes. By studying each unit
operation according to its function without regard to the in-
dustry in which it is used, the Chemical Engineer is trained to
recognize these functions in new industrial processes, and by
applying his knowledge and skill in the corresponding unit
operations is able to design, construct and operate a plant for
a new process with almost as much confidence as for a proven
process. The absorption refrigeration unit illustrated includes
the unit operations of heat transfer, absorption, distillation, and
fluid flow. These same unit operations may be used in differ-
ent combinations in the recovery of natural gasoline from nat-
ural gas, in the distillation of alcohol or in the preparation of
some new compound which was formerly a laboratory curiosity.
Because the Chemical Engineer is experienced and competent
in the individual unit operations, he is equally competent in any
industrial operation which is fundamentally an integration of the
individual unit operations. It is largely because of the philoso-
phy in his education and approach to engineering problems that
the Chemical Engineer has been able to make outstanding con-
tributions to the amazing multiplicity of new products from
modern industry.

The Story of
JIM YOUNG
THE General Electric refrigerators,
ranges, washers and other appli-
ances that homemakers will be buyng
it) 1950 are already under development.
James F. Young, ten years out of
Lafayette College's mechanical engi-
neering school, supervises the engi-
neering of these appliances-to-come.
Jim, graduating magna cum laude,
chose General Electric's job offer over
others because, as he says, "G.E.
offered more different fields of engi-
neering, had a better program than
anv other company, and could pro-
vide better experience."
The varied experience that Jim
sought came to him fast. While on
"Test" with G.E., he worked in four
different plants and at six different
assignments, rangingfrom supercharger
tests to studies in unbalance of hy-
draulic systems. Following "Test" he
enrolled in the G-E Creative Engineer-
ing Program and drew five assign-
ments in laboratories and design de-
partments.
When he had completed the course
he was appointed supervisor of it.
While organizing this course and
lecturing to the class, he studied an-
other—the C course in mechanical
engineering. He also wrote and edited
"Materials and Processes," published
in 1944.
His first "real work," he says, was
in helping to develop large-size rocket
launchers, both airborne and land
types. The creative engineering ability
he showed on this assignment, and
on later problems, insured his steady
progress to the top of the Advance
Engineering Section of his company's
Appliance and Merchandise Dept.
Next to schools and the U.S. Govern-
ment, General Electric employs more
college engineering graduates than
any other organization.


Jim became interested in mechanical prob-
lems early. In his teens he found a hobby
in rebuilding old autos.
As an early job with G.E. he organized and
taught engineering courses, became super-
visor of all mechanical engineering training.


During the war he helped develop the air-
borne rocket launcher, important factor in
smashing Nazi armor. A second war job:
development of gyroscopes for torpedoes.
Today Jim supervises the engineering of G-E
household appliances to be marketed two
to five years from now. He still directs the
training of many new engineers.

A human arm can throw a spear only so far. But
some ancient genius of an engineer figured out
that, by employing a throwing stick, which the
Aztecs called ailatl, the lever of the human arm
—and the distance achieved—could be extended,
with quite pointed results for an enemy.
Specifying molybdenum in steel is something like
using an atlatl. For molybdenum extends the use-
fulness of good steel. By providing good harden-
ability at low cost, molybdenum steels permit
modern engineers to save weight—and costs—
in design. It pays to specify molybdenum.

TO LIVE-THROUGH RESEARCH

This piece of equipment is a Cincinnati No. 2 Cylindrical Grinder used
for the past two and one-half years in a grinding research program. It
is equipped with d.c. motors on the wheel-spindle, work-spindle, and
table-traverse mechanism. These motors are controlled by field-type rhe- •
ostats that will provide either constant or variable conditions of investi-
gation depending upon the specific nature of the determination. A
standard test specimen of hardened steel is shown between the centers
on the table of the machine.
Up to the present time, this machine has been used in the evaluation of
fifty different grinding compounds at various degrees of concentration.
The equipment is now being used in an evaluation of some of the vari-
ables existent in the process of cylindrical grinding.

PLY
% m m
petroleum products
Within the past few years the prod-
ucts produced from petroleum and nat-
ural gas have reached such proportions
that they begin to stagger the imagina-
tion. Recently, it has been disclosed
that another list of petroleum products
is about to be placed on the public
market. These include: synthetic soaps
of exceptional quality; a type of resin
that can be formed into thin sheets and
used as a protective wrapper around
perishable items, keeping them fresh
during weeks of storage; more economi-
cal and highly effective insecticides and
fungicides; and a synthetic gasoline
from natural gas which has already been
placed on the commercial market and is
proving a rival to gasoline produced
from petroleum.
At present work is being carried on
to improve the quality of anti-knock
gasoline. It is believed that the new fuel
will give about 50% more mileage and
will thus reduce present gasoline costs.
The new gasolines are being made to
operate in engines of a higher compres-
sion ratio than presently used.
Because of the remarkable properties
of synthetic soap, it is believed that
within the next few years approximately
one fourth of the nation's soap supply
will be produced from oil or natural gas.
If for the next fifty years, the entire
soap industry would manufacture soap
from natural gas, only about one one-
hundredth of our present known gas
reserves would be consumed.
The new type resin, with its extra-
ordinary moisture-proof qualities, will
have considerable application in the
South. It is about five times as moisture
resistant as the highest grade of present-
day cellophane. Its worth will be proved
in its ability to preserve fruits and vege-
tables for much longer market periods
without the use of refrigeration.
The development of economical fungi-
cides and insecticides is at present en-
tailing considerable work. Insecticides
made from petroleum and natural gas
have been developed and are at least as
potent as nicotin. The greatest advan-
tage is the low cost of production.
The progress already made in the de-
velopment of petroleum and natural gas
products is only a beginning when com-
pared to the available possibilities. How-
ever, further development will require
expenditure of considerable time and ef-
fort before all the petroleum products
will be made available to the consumer.
windmill sailplane
Development of the Gyro-Glider by
the General Electric Flight Test Center
is a promising innovation in the field
of powerless aircraft. Two nine-foot
rotating blades provide sufficient lift to
support a 300 pound load in flight and
permit vertical descent at less than
parachute velocity.
The present model has a flying
weight of only 120 pounds, one-third
that of a standard glider, and has ex-

cellent directional control. Requiring a
landing field not over 60 feet in diam-
eter, the Gyro-Glider makes a for-
ward roll of only 20 to 30 feet when
landing.
Anticipating extensive application of
the design for commercial delivery to
inaccessible regions having no large
landing fields, trains of gliders towed
by a single powered aircraft could be
employed to make scheduled runs over
wide areas.
continuous rails
Another of the "can't be done's" has
been accomplished by no more difficult
a method than trial. Since the earliest
days of the iron horse, railroad con-
struction engineers have insisted on a
calculated spacing between the 39-foot
sections of steel to allow for thermal
expansion of the rail. Today, however,
it is a proven fact that unlimited
lengths of welded track can be em-
ployed without damage to the road
bed.
Sixteen years ago a continuous rail
was put into service by the Central of
Georgia in a stretch of track laid
through a tunnel. Since that time over
100 miles of similar construction have
been laid in lengths varying up to a
single 7000 foot stretch of open track.
In order to withstand a seasonal
temperature increase of 100 degrees
Farenheit, the continuous-rail roadbed
must be capable of restraining the nor-
mal expansion of steel, approximately
41 inches per mile. The primary hold-
ing force is the friction between the rail
and the tie plate which secures the rail
to the tie.
Ballast in the road holds the tie in
place, and extra clamps at the end of
each continuous section control any ex-
cess movement. Laying the rails when
the temperature is about midway be-
tween expected seasonal highs and lows
reduces possible stresses to a minimum
and no greater overall expansion is no-
ticed than is ordinarily common.
Advantages of the continuous rail
over conventional sectional construction
set forth by railroad experts include re-
duced shock on rails, freight, and rol-
ling stock; less noise for passengers; up
to 50 percent reduction of impact on
bridge loads; and less pavement dam-
age at road intersections.
miniature ocean
A miniature ocean in which ships'
gear remains stationary while water is
forced past it, is helping the U. S. Navy
uncover new secrets of design to im-
prove performance of its fighting ships.
Called a circulating water channel, this
modern test unit sends 750,000 gallons
of water coursing through an upright
circular aqueduct and drives it against
ships' gear or scaled ship models in a
reverse simulation of real equipment
plowing its way through the ocean.
Two huge motors furnish the power
to circulate 2,800 tons of water in the
channel at speeds as high as 12 miles
per hour. Surface water is kept flat to
permit visibility of under-currents, and
naval engineers can watch turbulence
from beneath or from either side through
plate glass. Through the" glass, the
water's push against objects can be
photographed, either with still or movie
cameras.
The circulating water channel resem-

The growing of plants is one of Standard of Indiana's
chief concerns, and it keeps our engineers up to
their necks constantly in big league problems. For
ours is a business of change—it never stands still.
Always there are new methods, new processes, new
products and improvements.
New structures are required, new units, often en-
tirely new plants. From the time a new plant is an
idea in a designer's mind until after it is finally
junked, the research engineer has a vital part.
It is up to him to develop any needed new mate-
rials to meet new operating conditions. Tempera-
tures may be as low as the —320° F. of liquid nitro-
gen or as high as the 2300° F. of a gas generator.
Pressures may be high or low and corrosion is usu-
ally a problem of major importance.
The stresses in complicated structures required
for new equipment frequently cannot be calculated
by conventional methods of analysis. Research en-
gineers, trained in mechanics, must develop, experi-
mentally and theoretically, new methods
to apply to such structures.
Prior to the construction of the plant,
research engineers, trained in mechanical
and electrical engineering, must study in
the laboratory such problems as heat trans-
fer, fluid flow, power reduction, and noise elimina-
tion. Later, they will check their theories and ex-
periments by tests in the plant itself.
For checking the physical parts of the plant, new
inspection methods—including such glamorous ones
as the x-ray and ultra-sonics—will be required. Our
physicists will develop them.
And with the plant in operation, there comes the
battle against deterioration—into which corrosion
engineers throw their full weight. It's a fight not
only to lengthen the life of plants in operation but
also to discover—even after a plant is junked—how
succeeding ones can be built to last longer.
Research engineering is of prime importance to
Standard Oil of Indiana. That is why a magnificently
equipped Engineering Laboratory will be part of
our new Research Center, now under construction
close to the Whiting, Indiana, refinery, near Chicago.

bles a rectangular shaped letter "0" in
the upright position. The upper hori-
zontal element is open at the top to pro-
vide the test channel while the two ver-
tical elements and the lower horizontal
member are completely enclosed to
make possible circulation of water. In
operation water is forced down one of
the vertical elements of the "0," across
the bottom horizontal member, up the
other vertical element and then through
the test channel.
To turn the water smoothly at cor-
ners, vanes have been inserted to guide
it in an arc rather than letting it make
a right angle turn which would disturb
and slacken its rate of flow. As the
water arrives at the test channel, its
surface is smoothed out. Flowing swift-
ly, but smoothly, the water then passes
the ship gear tied in the channel while
engineers, observing through the win-
dows, can study the action of the water
as it flows past the object being tested,
and photographers can record the action
for future study.
light beam communication
Communication over a beam of in-
visible infra-red light was recently
announced by the Navy as used for
ship-to-shore communication during the
war. Light beam communication is com-
monly referred to as "narrowcasting."
Its advantages over radio transmission
for short distances lie in the fact that
the receiver must be directly in line with
the beam of light, thus insuring secrecy
of transmission.

have been carried out since the early
1920's. At first communication was only
over short distances but gradually
equipment was perfected and resulted
in the transmission of light rays over
greater ranges. By using a neon lamp
suspended at the focal point of a con-
cave mirror and connected to the out-
put of an amplifier, it is possible to
modulate the light beam. At the receiv-
ing end another concave mirror with a
phototube at its focus picks up the light
impulses, sends them through successive
stages of amplification and then to a
loudspeaker. With this type of equip-
ment it is possible to obtain ranges of
up to two miles.
A more powerful system of light
transmission which used a 24 inch
searchlight with the arc modulated by a
10 kilowatt transmitter was later de-
veloped. With this equipment distances
up to 25 miles have been reached. Re-
cently beam communication has been
established between the U. S. Navy's
dirigibles in Los Angeles and a ground
station. Communication may be com-
pletely secret by using a filter over the
source of light. The filter blocks all
light rays except the infra-red, and also
reduces the range to approximately six
or seven miles.
new electric fixtures
Advanced electrical features will
mark the houses of the future. A main
circuit-breaker panelboard, located in
the garage, feeds electric power to two
circuit-breaker panels in the house.
None of the panelboards contain any
fuses. The houses will have about 70
lighting outlets, and over 100 conven-
ience outlets. Individual room lights
are controlled by means of push-but-
tons and electrical relays. Through a
master button all lights may be turned
on simultaneously if needed. Ward-
robes and closets are illuminated by
fluorescent lights controlled by door
switches.
Lamps for purposes other than light-
ing installed in the home include the
self-contained reflector type of infra-
red drying lamp, the bacteria-killing
Sterilamp, and the new sunlight lamp.
Installed over the washbasin and ad-
jacent mirror and mounted flush with
the ceiling of the bathroom, are a 250-
watt Westinghouse infra-red heat lamp
and a sunlight lamp. In a nearby cab-
inet housing the family toothbrushes,
a slender, tubular Sterilamp guards
against contamination.

A thorough understanding of the design
and application of Timken Tapered Roller
Bearings will enable you to solve at least 90%
of the bearing problems you are ever likely to
encounter when you begin your engineering
career after graduation.
When primitive man first made a hole in a
crude wooden wheel and slipped it over a
wooden axle he achieved the first function of
a bearing — support.
Support for wheels, shafts, gears and other
rotating parts still is the primary purpose of
bearings, but several other vital bearing re-
quirements are needed in modern equipment.
Ability to carry radial loads, thrust loads or
both together in any combination is one of the
most important of these. Ability to hold mov-
ing parts permanently in alignment is another.
Then of course there is the reduction of friction,
although this quality is common, in varying
degrees, to all anti-friction bearings.
The tapered roller bearing was introduced by
The Timken Roller Bearing Company nearly
50 years ago and today is universally used
throughout industry and transportation. Every
genuine Timken Bearing is unmistakably iden-
tified by the trade-mark "TIMKEN" stamped
on cup and cone.

Almost everything on earth has two
applications. Water has saved man: it
has also destroyed him. Fire has proven
indispensable to man's very existence:
it has also written some of the greatest
tragedies and has incurred unknown
suffering in the history of mankind. Air-
planes were invented originally for the
purpose of affording rapid transporta-
tion: airplanes have also been used to
lay waste man's material accomplish-
ments and to cause untold suffering.
Books were meant to aid man in his cul-
tural development and enlightenment;
yet they are used to lower moral stand-
ards and bring man down to the level
of an irrational animal. And so with
nuclear power. It may be used to aid
mankind in his struggle against the un-
controlled forces of nature, or man may,
through his folly and greed for power
and international superiority, turn this
destructive weapon against himself. And
so it remains the task of each and every
individual of this world to do his utmost
to raise the standard of living of all
mankind, to decrease the raging dis-
content among nations; to substitute
greed for power, by extending justice to
all; to replace economic blockading of
nations by mutual trade agreements
with all nations; to live as men and not
as animals and to work with one another
rather than against one another for the
betterment of all concerned.
Importance of
Crossroads"
'Operation
Many people would prefer not to dis-
cuss the horrible sufferings imposed up-
on man by an exploding atomic bomb.
However, in this day and age, we must
look back at the mistakes of our fore-
fathers and profit from them. Following
World War I humanity was saturated
with a desire for total disarmament. The
war had ended all wars. Business was
as 'usual.' Our prime interest was the al-
mighty dollar and all the pleasure we
could derive from it. We were blinded
to such an extent that we forgot to real-
ize how small the world was becoming.
We didn't want to meddle in other na-
tions' affairs. Hitler's rise to power was
none of our business. Mussolini's fascist
policies were not considered cause for
alarm. Sale of scrap steel and oil and
planes to Japan was just good business.
However, on December 7, 1941, our
eyes were opened. We realized, too late,
that we had made a mistake. The same
situation faces us today. We have the
atomic bomb, and we should know and
realize its devastating potentialities. We
should not again be blinded and lulled
into a false sense of security by political
demagogues. The tests at Bikini Atoll
in the summer of 1946 clearly reveal the
devastating effect of atomic power.
The destruction of war vessels in the
Bikini tests showed the possibilities of
atomic power as a military weapon.
Some observers were disappointed in the
results of "Operation Crossroads" be-
cause they were led to believe that the
nuclear reactions would cause earth-
quakes and volcanoes; would uproot the
trees, and would literally obliterate tre-
mendous areas. It must be remembered
that the effects of an explosion diminish
very rapidly as the distance increases.
Facts show that at the Bikini tests the
heat from the explosion left no visible
traces of damage three miles away.
All the vessels within a quarter-mile
radius of the target area were a mass of
twisted wreckage. Bulkheads were bent,
railings twisted, doors smashed, smoke
stacks collapsed, antennas were de-
formed, and deck gear was unrecogniz-
able. The effect of the explosion pene-
trated the interior of the vessels and
seriously damaged motor control units,
switches and electronic equipment used
in the operation of a sea vessel. Most

Within the past few years, quite a
bit of publicity has been given to the
achievements of the electron microscope
in such varied fields as the identifica-
tion of bacteria and viruses, the study
of large organic molecules, metallurgi-
cal research, and quick chemical analy-
sis by electron diffraction. This article
is presented with the view in mind that
the engineer and layman both may find
some interest in the principles and tech-
niques which form the basis of electron
microscope operation.
Principles
In the process of searching for knowl-
edge, research workers have continually
sought to extend the range and power of
their eyes. It was therefore quite na-
tural that the first instruments for in-
vestigating the very distant and the
very small should have been adjuncts to
the eyes employing visible light.
At first, limitations upon increasing
the range of these instruments were en-
countered due to imperfections of lenses
and other factors of instrument con-
struction. However, in the field of light
microscopy, a more fundamental limita-
tion upon magnifying power was soon
encountered. It was impossible to see as
two distinct points, objects which were
closer together than the wave length of
the light used in observing them. The
minimum separation observable with a
light microscope is given bv Abbe as:
Eq. 1. d =:
p. sin o
where d is the minimum separation; /*
is the index of refraction of the lens

Magnesium Oxide crystals.
material; and a is the angle between the
axis of the system and the ray from the
object point to the edge of the first
lens (the half-angle of the cone of rays).
The human eye can detect light of wave-
lengths between 3600 and 7800 A.U.*,
with maximum sensitivity at 5576 A.U.
But vision is still satisfactory with blue
light of 4200 A.U. Using this wave-
length and values for the other quanti-
ties as they are encountered in conven-
tional microscopes with oil immersion,
we have:
0.61 X 4200
d= 1.6 X0.9 =18°°A-U-
The corresponding magnification is 1100
diameters. Light of shorter wavelength
than that of visible light (ultraviolet)
may be used for microphotography. At
\ = 2500 A.U., d = 1100 A.U., maxi-
mum magnification is 1800. This magni-
fication is satisfactory for seeing bacte-
ria which range from 10,000 to 20,000
A.U. in size but is not powerful enough
for showing viruses whose size varies
from less than 100 A.U. to 1000 A.U.
A reasonable solution seemed to lie
in the use of something having a wave-
length shorter than that of light, but
shorter electromagnetic waves in the
x-ray band cannot be focused by lenses.
However, a moving electron has been
shown by de Broglie to have an effec-
tive wavelength of:
Eq-2-A=(v + v'xio-)*A-u-
where V is the velocity of the electron.
Accelerating potentials employed in
present electron microscopes range from
50,000 to 100,000 volts, giving electron
velocities one half that of light. Substi-
tution in Eq. 1 of the wavelength ob-
tained from Eq. 2, for this velocity,
gives a minimum separation of less than
one A.U. and a theoretical magnification
of one million diameters. However, the
electron microscope is still at the stage
of development wherein resolution is
limited by imperfections of lenses. At
present, the practical limit of resolution
is 50 A.U., and the corresponding useful
* A.U. stands, for angstrom units. One
angstrom unit equals 1/100,000,000 (10-")
cm., or approximately 4 billionths of an inch.
limit of magnification is of the order of
200,000 diameters. Even so, this is a
one-hundredfold improvement over the
light microscope.
Therein lay the physical basis for
using electrons rather than light waves
to form magnified images, but the crea-

tion of an instrument for their use had
to await the development of another
field in which man is seeking to extend
his vision, namely television. It was for
purposes of television image reproduc-
tion that most of the work had been
done on electron accelerating electrodes
(electron guns), on electrostatic and
electromagnetic focusing and deflection
methods, and on fluorescent screens for
the production of visible light when
struck by rapidly moving electrons.
The main column of the R.C.A. in-
strument consists of a metal tube ap-
proximately four feet long and varying
in diameter from five to eight inches.
This column is supported vertically with
its base on a table-like pedestal three
feet high. The pedestal and a protec-
tive housing for the top end of the tube
are built out forward from the seven
foot tall cabinet which contains the
fifty-seven-tube power supply. A sys-
tem of mechanical and oil diffusion
pumps maintains a vacuum of one ten
millionth atmospheric pressure in the
column.
At the upper end of the column is
located the electron gun, which acceler-
ates the 400-microampere beam through
a potential of 60,000 volts and shoots
it down the tube.
A few inches below the electron gun
is the first magnetic lens, which acts in

of a light microscope to give a concen-
trated parallel beam.
Just below this condenser lens is an
air lock system which permits the plac-
ing of specimens in the path of the beam
for observation. The specimens for the
electron microscope must be especially
chosen and prepared, owing to the fact
that the electron beam would be stopped
or completely diffused by any material
greater than a few hundred angstroms
thick. The actual particles of the speci-
men are supported on a thin film of
collodion, prepared as described in the
second portion of this paper. The thin
plastic film is itself supported upon a
fine wire-mesh screen. The screen is in
the form of a disk % of an inch in
diameter and is punched from 200-
mesh-per to-linear-inch wire gauge. The
spaces between wires are 1/400 of an
inch square. In spite of the tiny size of
these openings, each image covers by
a factor of ten the field of view on
the last four-inch diameter screen.
The prepared specimen screen is
placed in a cap which fits on the end of
a small holder tube. The tube is placed
in a cradle within the air lock. The

lock is then closed and the air ex-
hausted, the inner valve opened, and the
cradle moved to the center of the col-
umn in line with the electron beam.
During operation the cradle can be
moved to permit scanning the screen.
Next in line below the specimen
chamber is the objective lens which
produces an intermediate image magni-
fied 160 diameters. The construction
and action of this lens should be con-
sidered in some detail since the entire
effectiveness of the electron microscope
depends upon it. The lens consists, es-
sentially, of a solenoid whose axis coin-
cides with that of the column. A very
steady direct current through this sole-
noid produces a magnetic field whose
flux lines are parallel to the axis of the
solenoid except at the upper and lower
ends, where they spread to enter the
carefully-shaped pole pieces and return
through the iron case surrounding the
coil. The equipotential surfaces of this
field are convex surfaces, similar in ge-
ometry to a convex optical lens. The
diverging pencils of electron rays from
points on the specimen are acted upon
by this field as they pass through the
center of the coil and are converged to
form points of the intermediate image.
Contrast between the images of dense
and thin portions of the specimen is the
result of the very narrow aperture angle
of the objective lens (0.001 to 0.01
rad.). Parallel electron rays which pass
through thin portions of the specimen
are diffused only slightly, giving a small
angle of divergence and permitting most
of the rays from that portion to pass
through the objective aperture, thereby
producing a bright spot at their point of
focus in the intermediate image. A
dense portion of the specimen scatters
the electrons into a widely divergent
pencil, only a small part of which can
pass through the aperture. This results
in a dim or dark spot of the image. The
outlines of particles such as bacteria are
seen very sharply due to the sudden
change of density from thin film to
dense particle. Internal detail of ho-
mogeneous material such as tissue sec-
tions is more difficult to obtain owing to
the slight variation in density.
A portion of the intermediate image
formed by the objective lens passes
through a second aperture and is magni-
fied 30 to 100 times more by the projec-
tor lens. This lens focuses the rays to
form a final image upon the upturned
face of a flat fluorescent screen at the
bottom of the column. The image cov-
ers a four-inch circle on the screen and
may be viewed directly through eyeports
set at 45° angles into the sides of a
bell-shaped skirt around the column just
above the final screen.
Photographs are obtained by flipping
up the fluorescent screen and permitting
the electrons to impinge directly upon

Etched Chromium-Nickel surface.
the emulsion of a photographic plate,
which has been introduced through an
air-lock similar to the one in the speci-
men chamber. Total magnification of
the final image is the product of objec-
tive and projector magnifications and
ranges from 4,000 to 16,000 diameters.
In addition, resolution and contrast on
the photographic plate are sufficient to
permit six or eight-fold optical enlarge-
ment to a total of 100,000 diameters.
Techniques
To be suitable for examination under
the electron microscope, specimens must
retain their shape and character while
in a vacuum of 10~4 mm. of Hg. and
while subject to the bombardment of the
electron beam, which will often heat the
specimens to ISO degrees C. It will
thus be recognized that all volatile con-
stituents of the samples will be removed
when the specimen is inserted in the
microscope.
A specimen also must be thin enough
to transmit most of the electron beam
so that differential scattering, varying
in accordance with the dimensions and
density of the specimen, will form an

The saga of the element vanadium
started out to be a very dull narrative
after it was discovered almost a century
and one-half ago by the Mexican, An-
dres Del Rio. Del Rio had made labo-
ratory investigations of a brown lead
ore—really vanadinite—and, due to the
astonishing results of his tests, an-
nounced to the world that the ore
contained a new element. However,
further experimentation with this vana-
dium-containing ore by a European
scientist showed that, in all probability,
the so-called new element was really
only a lead chromate, and Del Rio's
claim was disqualified.
In 1830 a Swedish scientist, Sefstrom,
rediscovered vanadium, his tests con-
clusively demonstrating the existence of
the element.
It wasn't until the turn of the cen-
tury that vanadium became recognized
as a very useful metal. It was used to a
limited extent in the coloring of glass
and as a mordant for dyeing purposes.
Other than these rather insignificant ap-
plications, vanadium was simply another
square on Mendelyeev's periodic table.
The climax of vanadium's saga, how-
ever, was to come in the year 1900,
when Professor J. O. Arnold of Sheffield
University, England, after an intensive
investigation, reported on the effect of
the addition of vanadium to steel. He
found that the addition of only .2 or
.3% of vanadium to steel greatly in-
creased its elastic limit and tensile
strength without reducing its ductility.
A great number of his tests were carried
out on tool steel, and he found that a
carbon tool steel containing .30% of
vanadium would cut 75% more turnings
than the same steel with 3% of tung-
sten. Also, the result of adding vana-
dium to steels already containing metals
such as nickel, tungsten, and chromium
turned out to be even greater than in
the case of the plain carbon steel.
After the announcement of Arnold's
investigations and other publications on
the subject by the Institute of Mechani-
cal Engineers, many were convinced of
the usefulness of vanadium as an alloy-
ing material. However, many doubts
arose from the economic standpoint as
to the practical application of vanadium
since, being classified as a rare metal,
it was more costly than gold. Vanadium
was found to be widely distributed in
nature, occurring frequently in lead,
zinc, and copper clays and shales, but
usually in such small quantities that its
extraction was not profitable. At any
rate, there was a potential "gold mine"
lying wherever vanadium was deposited.

untrained in the art of prospecting.

started the search for vanadium. They
discovered an exceedingly rich deposit
of vanadium ore in the Andes of Peru,
and by means of the proper reduction
process, the Flannerys began to extract
the mineral from the ore.
Among the materials that the engi-
neer depends upon more than any others
is steel. For many purposes the strength
of ordinary carbon steel is not sufficient,
although its strength may be increased
by hardening, tempering, and acid heat-
treatment. Such carbon steels that are
available for structural or machinery
purposes ordinarily do not possess suf-
ficiently high tensile strength or rea-
sonably high resistance to impact. How-
ever, if steel is alloyed or fortified with
other metals, a considerably greater
range of mechanical properties is avail-
able.
The use of vanadium as an alloying
material depends upon two functions.
One is the positive action of vanadium
in producing a very small grain size in
steels; the other involves the behavior
of vanadium carbides and their stability
with an increase in temperature.
Vanadium is an element which readi-
ly forms a carbide. Very little vanadium
is thought to be dissolved in ferrite, the
bulk of it being in the cementite as a
complex carbide or in solid solution.
Vanadium is a deoxidizing and scaveng-
ing element, and although too expensive
to be primarily used for that purpose its
addition doubtless assists in the thor-
ough deoxidation of steel. However,
vanadium's province is that of an alloy-
ing element and, as such, it is unique in
the very small amounts required. Hypo-
eutectoid alloy steels containing vana-
dium carry only .15% to .20% of the
element and no advantage seems to be
gained by increasing the amount.
In modern high-speed tool steel, va-
nadium is considered almost as essential
as tungsten and chromium, owing to the
great stability of vanadium carbide at
elevated temperatures. In such steel
.75% to 2% vanadium is regularly
used.
12
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


in that it greatly reduces the tendency
toward grain growth of austentite on
heating. Temperatures that would ruin
an analagous plain carbon or plain
chromium steel are not only harmless
with vanadium present, but are required
to produce the best results.
As was mentioned before, vanadium
steels are characterized by exceptional
fineness of grain. The trace of vana-
dium in solution in the ferrite obstructs
diffusion; also vanadium-bearing cemen-
tite can diffuse less readily. Conse-
quently the sorbite of vanadium steel
tends to be finer with less agglomera-
tion of cementite and separation of fer-
rite than without the vanadium.
The vanadium acts as if it were a
disperser of the "sonims" (solid non-
metallic impurities). It scatters and
deflouccates the sonims so well that they
are in ultramicroscopic dispersion, and
have no chance to exert a segregation
or "mass" effect. This makes for a
"homogeneously" fine-grained steel.
This fine grain size is the reason for
the outstanding properties of heat-
treated steels containing vanadium, and
also for the high elastic limit in propor-
tion to the tensile strength and ductility.
In general, however, straight vanadium
steel is the exception rather than the
rule, due to the expense of vanadium.
Usually vanadium is combined with
other alloys; it is when used in this
manner that it finds its widest applica-
tion.
One outstanding property of vana-
dium is that it does not confer on steel
or iron marked air-hardening properties.
In complicated shapes, such as loco-
motive frames, castings, and large ir-
regularly-shaped forgings which would
be almost certain to crack in the
quenching process of heat treatment,
normalized or annealed plain vanadium
steel finds an important application.
This is one of the cases where the
straight vanadium steel may be used.
When vanadium is used in crankshafts
for automobiles, diesel engines, etc., no
strains develop when the forgings are
allowed to air-cool, and, consequently,
there is no warping which would require
cold-work straightenings (which in turn
sets up other strains).
The affinity of vanadium for nitrogen
renders vanadium steel particularly
adaptable to the cyaniding process for
surface hardening. Consequently, in
surface-hardened parts such as nuts,
bolts, washers, forgings, etc., vanadium

steel is often used. Because of the re-
sistance of vanadium to the harmful
effects of nitrogen, chrome-vanadium
steel has been generally used for the
converters in the Haber process of am-
monia production.
The element has such a myriad of
uses that it is impossible to describe
them all. Today it is found playing in-
numerable minor roles in practically
every phase of industrial activity. For
example, Vanadium is being used in
agriculture as a chemical component of
insecticides, and experiments indicate
that the addition of vanadium to soil
will improve crops and yields. In sul-
furic acid manufacture, vanadium cata-
lyst, besides being much cheaper than
platinum, has the great advantage of
being insenitive to platinum "poisons,"
such as arsenic. Other sundry applica-
tions of vanadium are found in the fields
of photography, paints and varnishes,
therapeutics, and in the manufacture of
glass.
In recent years, improvements have
been made in iron castings and today
specifications for cast iron are as ac-
curately controlled and almost as nu-
merous as for steel. Crankshafts, cam-
shafts, and other automotive parts for-
merly forged from steel are now being
made of cast iron.
However, probably the most impor-
tant action of vanadium is its control-
ling influence on the tensile strength of
an alloy cast iron. By the addition of
vanadium, a reduction in strength varia-
tions from melt to melt is brought
about, narrowing down the tensile
strength values to a predictable range.
This is evidenced from the accompany-
ing graph. The significance of this uni-
formity is that it enables the manufac-
turer of alloy cast iron to assure his cus-
tomer of uniform tensile strength.
The alloying metals (V, ni, mo, cu,
zr, ti, etc.) have played no small part
in this development. Except in cases
where uniformity of hardness and
strength throughout a heavy section is
the only required characteristic, vana-
dium is used in cast irons with other
alloying elements. The presence of it is
important in that it not only reduces
graphitization in cast irons, but also
prevents the occurrence of free ferrite
and the accompanying groups of large

TO SCIENCE: A CHALLENGE
by
GEORGE R. CROSSMAN '48 E
Last month we took a brief glance,
from the standpoint of modern im-
provements in living conditions, at the
effects of science and technology on
mankind. Many more questions have
arisen in the increasing complexity of
our society, the direct result of the
advances in scientific improvements.
Some of the most important and most
widely-asked are these three:
1. Does the "scientific" approach
hold the answers to all man's prob-
lems?
2. Are scientists morally responsible
for the use made of their discoveries
and inventions?
3. What of the social problems cre-
ated by the application of these dis-
coveries and advances?
These and many other questions chal-
lenge the thinking person, and many
answers have been offered by the lead-
ing minds of the world. What are their
answers? What implications do they
have for us as members of society and
students of the field of knowledge that
has created the problems concerned?
Men Who Make the Future
Bruce Bliven in his book Men Who
Make the Future1 has attempted to set
forth some of the challenges science is
offering to man and some of the opin-
ions of present day engineers and sci-
entists regarding these challenges. A
journalist and social psychologist, Mr.
Bliven has put forth, in a non-techni-
cal mode of presentation, the aspects of
the present scientific situation lying be-
neath some of the most difficult ques-
tions in the socio-scientific field. Draw-
ing upon the present research projects
of such men as Enrico Fermi, E. O.
Lawrence, Vannevar Bush, and Lewis
Chubb, he discussed the possibilities of
man's control of human characteristics
by means of genes, hormones, and or-
ganic chemistry, of physical and mental
diseases by viruses, heredity, and the
physical sciences; and raises the ques-
tion of the implications of these possi-
bilities for moral social control. The
tie-up of the discoveries of the physical
sciences and the utility of engineering
apparatus with these results of natural
science is presented and such questions
as, 'What makes a star blow up?,' and
'What lies between living and dead mat-
ter?' are raised. The book expands at
the end to bring in answers to the so-
cial and moral questions raised in the
book from some of the scientists partic-
ipating in the research projects men-
tioned.
The Engineer in Society
Another aspect of the social picture
with which the engineer is confronted
is the place he will make for himself in
society, the particular branch of engi-
neering he will choose, and the criteria
for judging the possible results of any
given choice. One attempt to give stu-
dent engineers a more complete picture
of engineering as a profession and its
characteristics in various fields may be
found in John Mill's book, The Engi-
neer in Society.2 The author, himself
an engineer for the Bell Telephone Co.,
has herein presented a summary of the
experiences he has had in choosing en-
gineering as a career. Beginning with
a discussion of the relationship of the
engineer and the scientist to society, he
progresses to more specific questions
such as the problem of executing, sal-
aries and their significance, manage-
ment and labor and the scientific atti-
tude toward that problem, and some of
the issues involved in the unionization
of engineers. The book is written in a
friendly, personal tone with an accent
on the social components of engineering
life. The hard, cold, piercing technique
is missing but his ideas are clearly ex-
pressed.
Among recent magazine articles perti-
nent to the subject of science and soci-
ety is "Science and Man's Dilemma" 3
by Bruce Melvin, secretary of the
American Association for the Advance-
ment of Science. Raising questions such
as, "Does society know how to live with
this new power it possesses?" "Can sci-
ence, or man, by using scientific meth-
ods, control man's destiny?" Mr. Mel-
vin makes some startling comparisons
between modern America and pre-Hit-
ler Germany. Finding that the scien-
tific spirit failed there, he draws from
the apparent faith of present day
America in science a dark picture for
the future. Man, he says in effect, has
tremendous power but no apparent will
to control it. Yet he maintains that
science does hold the answers if only
man will utilize it. The scientists, he
feels, have the tools and knowledge to
solve the problems of society. They
must expand the scientific method to
all of life and living.
In a similar vein, George Lundberg,
Professor of Sociology at Washington
University, in an article entitled, "Can
Science Save Us?," * argues that through
the social sciences the scientific method
can be applied to social problems, if
only man will recognize the scientific
aspects of their authority. The phys-
ical sciences do not hold the answers,
he feels, but the social sciences do. The
solution he puts forth is a greater
"working together" of the physical and
social sciences.
Still a third answer to our problem
has been proposed by Dr. H. W. Dobbs,
President of Princeton University, in
his speech, "The New Responsibilities
of Science."B Science, he says, cannot
continue to deny its social responsibil-
ity. Yet we cannot impose restrictions
on the freedom of research. The an-
swer he offers is one of supplementa-
tion of scientific research with higher
spiritual aspirations that will combine
with free research to provide a better
world for all.

Ethics
The end of the war has found the
arrival, once again, of the parleys on
professional ethics which have been so
well received in the past by the en-
gineering students on campus. This ac-
tivity simply gathers engineering stu-
dents together for a discussion of vari-
ous situations involving ethics, which a
professional engineer continually comes
upon in his practice. The parleys are
sponsored by the University of Michi-
gan and are under the direction of sev-
eral experienced faculty men.
To draw on practical experience, the
parley is centered around a speaker who
presents to the students various ethical
problems which he has encountered or
observed while in industry. The speak-
ers are either faculty men or practicing
engineers. After the presentation of his
cases, the speaker, together with the stu-
dent appointed as chairman for the
evening, conducts a discussion on the
cases. From this point on, the parley
pretty well takes care of itself. To break
down any shyness or inhibitions of the
audience, refreshments are served an
hour or so after the meeting gets under
way. It is usually at this point that the
audience participation reaches its height
and a highly desirable spontaneity per-
vades the meeting.
Engineering students are notified con-
cerning the parley by formal invitation
and the number present at each gather-
ing never exceeds thirty of forty people.
The gatherings are kept this small be-
cause if made larger they would tend to
discourage the informal discussion peri-
od following the speaker's address and
not enough of the audience would be
able to participate.
On March 25, Professor Donald L.
Katz of the Chemical Engineering De-
partment presented several interesting
cases. In each example, the particular
man involved in the case had to make
some ethical evaluation based on both
legal and moral principles before he
decided on the proper action to take.
Dr. Katz then asked his audience, made

up in the main of chemical engineering
students, what the would do if con-
fronted with similar circumstances. A
highly polemic but fruitful discussion
followed.
Owing to the difficulty of reaching all
senior engineering students and at the
same time attempting to keep the meet-
ings small, a student invited once will
probably not be asked to attend future
meetings. Attendance is by invitation
only. Student chairmen for the meet-
ings are: John Holland, Jack Holt, Karl
Henion II, Roger Hotte, and Frank
Arams.
A.I.E.E.
The University of Michigan Branch
of the American Institute of Electrical
Engineers—Institute of Radio Engi-
neers meets several times each semester
to hear lectures on subjects pertaining
to the various phases of electrical engi-
neering, to view technical and non-
technical motion pictures, to participate
in field trips to nearby industrial estab-
lishments, and to hold the Annual Ban-
quet in the winter and the Annual Picnic
in the spring.
Occasional dances are sponsored by
the Branch, and such projects as the
electrical part of the Engineering Open
House were conducted through the or-
ganization.
The refreshments served each meet-
ing are paid for by means of the Local
Membership dues (one dollar per year).
A Local Membership card permits par-
ticipation in the field trips, the Banquet,
and the Picnic.
The Branch also handles applications
for membership in the two national or-
ganizations, the A.I.E.E. and the I.R.E.
Sigma Rho Tau
There were great "doings" down by the
"ol' stump" on March 18. The quaint
concrete stump located in the West En-
gineering Angle and symbolic of the
podiums of old where men with great
and majestic speech swayed the hoi
polloi was the scene of a Sigma Rho
Tau informal initiation. Gathered there
for the occasion were the fourteen ini-
tiates and some of the regular members
of the Sigma Rho Tau speech organiza-
tion. A public address system was con-
nected up and turned on during the
noon hour. (It is said that Professor
Van den Broek of the Engineering Me-
chanics Department had a moment of
shear failure while attempting to con-
duct an E.M. 2 class at that time.)
Each of the initiates was allowed
some five minutes "on the air," in which
time he was required to give a speech
on Tung Oil, present a funny story,
and tell a couple of jokes. A wide varie-
ty of speeches ensued correlating the
Indian varnish base, Tung Oil, with
a so called Tongue Oil, a liquid of
doubtful origin, whose formula is said
to be known only by Professor R. D.
Brackett. (Reliable sources have it that
the good professor believes a really
good speaker must gargle with at least
IS c.c.'s of the potion just before any
elocutionary endeavor.)
As each initiate was put through his
paces behind the mike, various hecklers,
previously planted in the audience, rang
out with cat-calls and other disturbing
sounds aimed at flustering the poor ini-
tiate.
President Charles Chadwick of the
organization and Bill Lamb introduced
each speaker as his turn came up, and
by one o'clock the ceremonies were over.
The initiates were formally inducted
that evening, rising in rank from that of
a neophyte to the position of novice.
The new novices are: Herb Greene,
Karl Henion, William Shank, Wilford
Howard, Russell Rollin, John Miatech,
Carl Hanson, Clinton Boothe, Jack
Holt, Dave Raffel, Roger Emmert, Tom
Schulte, Fred Peterson, and Phil Bed-
ein.
Quarterdeck
An ambitious schedule of meetings
has been completed this year by the
naval architects and marine engineers of
this engineering society. Closer rela-
tions with those in the marine field have
resulted from joint meetings held with
the Propeller Club of the United States
and with the Great Lakes Section of the
Society of Naval Architects and Marine
Engineers, and closer relations among
the students themselves and with the
faculty have resulted from the numer-
ous meetings at which new members,
eleven last semester, present their own
papers on subjects supplementary to
their school work.

The scene of Professor Harold R.
Lloyd's "prep" school days was King
William's College, on the Isle of Man.
At the age of nineteen, Mr. Lloyd re-
ceived the Senior Mathematical Scholar-
ship at Gonville and Caius College, Cam-
bridge, where he studied from 1899
until 1903. During his university work
he was awarded first class honors in
both mathematics and the mechanical
sciences.
In comparing the curricula of Cam-
bridge University with those offered at
the University of Michigan, Mr. Lloyd
says that the basic, preparatory courses
are much the same. The courses were
more comprehensive and less technically
detailed at the turn of the century, but
this was due, perhaps, to the lack of
specific technical knowledge available
today. He believes that "It is better to
have the fundamental theory taught
you. Maybe we do specialize a little too
much in modern engineering schooling."

Harold R. Lloyd
Upon graduation from Cambridge,
Mr. Lloyd entered a graduate training
program in electrical engineering with
the British Westinghouse Electrical and
Manufacturing Co., Ltd., of Manches-
ter, where his duties included the test-
ing of electrical machinery and instru-
ments. British Westinghouse has since
become Metropolitan Vickers, Ltd., one
of the largest manufacturers of elect-
rical equipment in the British Isles.
In 1905, Mr. Lloyd joined the firm
of Hans Renold, Ltd., the maker of the
famous "Silent Chain." There he was
in charge of purchasing and testing the
steels used in the manufacture of these
chain drives, and he supervised the
design of mass-production and custom-
built equipment. In 1911, Mr. Lloyd
was made a director of this firm.
He first crossed the Atlantic to Amer-
ica in the next year, when he joined the
staff of the University of Michigan as
an instructor. He taught classes in
Heat Engines, Mechanics, and the Me-
chanical Laboratory during the three
years from 1912 to 1915.
When the First World War broke
out, Professor Lloyd returned to Eng-
land, rejoining the Hans Renold or-
ganization as it rolled into war-produc-
tion. He became Personnel Manager of
the company's Manchester Munitions
Works, and was particularly active in
labor relations matters and educational
programs.
In 1924, Mr. Lloyd returned to Ann
Arbor and the University of Michigan
as an assistant professor, and he was
advanced to the rank of associate pro-
fessor in 1936. He has since taught
courses in Mechanism and Machine
Design, as well as his specialty, Ad-
vanced Dynamics, including Vibrations
and Gyroscopic Action. Professor Lloyd
became an American citizen in 1940.
It was in Ann Arbor that he first
tried the game of golf, and he finds it
"Much more fun than cricket, for I do
not think much of the national sport
of my home country! Although I'm
not too good at golf, I've recently
bought a new set of good clubs."
A member of the University of Michi-
gan Choral Union for more than ten
years, and of St. Andrew's Episcopal
Choir for nearly twenty, Professor Lloyd
has always supported good music in
Ann Arbor, and he has regularly at-
tended the concerts and May Festivals
in the city.

Born in Detroit on May 13, 1923,
Henry Leonard Kaminski is a Detroiter
from head to toe (and that's seventy-
five inches, at last count). We can't
call him provincial, however, for his
family took him abroad to Paris when
he was six years old. Says Hank,
of his continental journey, "Ah, Gay
Paree!"
He began his scholastic career with
kindergarten in Westfield, Massachu-
setts, but returned to Detroit for the
remainder of his schooling. Hank was
president of Student Representatives

Henry L. Kaminski
and of his chapter of the National
Honor Society in Cass Technical High
School, from which he graduated in
1941. Then, in Hank's own words, "I
went directly into war work, contribu-
ting my 'talents' as a toolroom machine
hand at the Centerline Tank Arsenal of
the Chrysler Corporation." From here,
he went to the Naval Ordnance plant
nearby as a toolmaker, "singing his way
through jigs and fixtures." Hank at-
tended Wayne University while he was
doing this war-'/ork, for he didn't want
to lose his studying techniques.
Coming back from a "short trick for
Uncle Sam" in 1944, Hank entered the
College of Engineering at Michigan, and
simultaneously plunged into extra-cur-
ricular activities up to his neck. He
maintained a scholastic average which
qualified him for Tau Beta Pi, but

carbide cutters
Continuous and high-speed cutting
for carbide tools has proven to be an
unnecessary production requirement, ac-
cording to one manufacturer who has
been using Carboloy planer tools for
over five years. The carbide bit em-
ployed at planer speeds of 70 to 200
surface feet per minute gives greater
output at higher speeds and also better
size and finish than is obtainable with
high-speed steel.
On "hogging cuts" over five-eighths
of an inch in depth, steel tools have
the advantage. However, the former be-
lief that high-speed steel rather than
carbide was necessary for any machine
set-up on which severe interruptions in
cutting occur is no longer accepted.
Planing of textile machine beds con-
taining numerous internal bracing webs
and other interruptions is normally car-
ried out at 200 SFPM with excellent
results.
A practical shop procedure devel-
oped by the machining company has
been the maintenance of reference files
on carbide performance and tooling
data. Available to the engineer is
needed information on number of cuts,
types of tools, feed, depth of cut, speed
of cutting and speed of return which
have been used on previous planing
jobs.
power plants
Many new hydroelectric plants are
being dreamed of, designed, and built
to furnish powers for the coming elec-
trical age. Two of the best-known proj-
ects are the Missouri Valley Authority
and the St. Lawrence Seaway project.
Canada has completed recently one of
the large power developments in this
hemisphere which will be used here as a
modern example. The Shipshaw proj-
ect in Northern Quebec was built se-
cretly during the war to provide power
for the Aluminum reduction plants at
Arvide and Isle Maligne, whose produc-
tion was needed to complete the air-
plane construction program of Great
Britain.
The principal requirements of a hy-
droelectric plant are; a constant large
supply of water with an adequate head,
proximity to the consumers, and the
power development must be economi-
cally sound. That is, the return on the
investment from selling power must
warrant the large initial expense in con-
structing the plant.
The dam in the Saguenay River had
been built previously, leaving to be
built; a head channel 7500 ft. long, 300
to 500 ft. wide with a maximum cut
of 105 ft., a head block, six penstocks
30 ft. in. diam., and 700 ft. long, a
plant for the six turbines, and a tail
race.
The head channel is a canal to carry
the water from the forebay behind the
dam to the penstocks. It must be of
sufficient size to handle the necessary
amount of water without an undue
amount of fall. The cut for the head
channel was made in 40 ft. benches, a
total of 1,600,000 cu. yds. of rock ex-
cavation and 2,000,000 cu. yds. of earth
excavation. The rock was anorthosite
composed mainly of the mineral feld-

The Shipshaw project is furnished a
minimum of 42,500 cubic feet per sec-
ond under a head of 208 feet by the
dammed Saguenay River. The twelve
100,000 hp turbo-generators can deliver
the power equivalent of 10,000 automo-
bile engines—1,200,000 hp, most of
which is consumed by the aluminum
plants about twenty miles away. No ex-
pense was spared in completing this proj-
ect since it was vitally needed, and it
promises to be a good investment in
time of peace.
Before actual construction of the
plant could begin, a city for five thou-
sand people complete with theaters,
churches, schools and stores, 16 miles of
roads and 17 miles of railroads had to
be built. The average employment was
about 4000 people with a maximum of

spar. This rock was fairly easy to drill
and broke into angular blocks readily.
The head block is the plug in the end
of the head channel—in this case being
composed naturally of a rock ridge
which was shaped up easily. From the
head block the penstocks, large tunnels
to carry the water to the turbines at
the plant, were bored through solid
rock which supported them up to the
plant proper. The six penstocks were
34 ft. in. diam., and 850 ft. long, and
were lined with steel plate. The total
rock excavation for the penstocks was
144,000 cu. yds.
The water, after passing through the
turbines, flows into the tail race which
is located near the junction of the

of the castings aboard ship were broken
and indicated clearly that future war
vessels would be practically void of any
metal fabricated in a brittle form.
In the under water explosion of the
atomic bomb, millions of tons of water
were hurled skyward more than a mile
in a column about a half-mile in diame-
ter. This water was contaminated with
fission products estimated to be equiva-
lent to hundreds of tons of radium. This
death-laden sea water washed down
ventilators and funnels and saturated
the circulating systems, pumps and
evaporators. Portions of many suriving
vessels are as yet uninhabitable be-
cause of the radioactive products lodged
in pipes, and scale inside sea water
piping.
The significance of the tests is clear
and may best be presented in simple
language.
An atomic bomb of the present size
and type, exploding in the air, would
destroy everything within one-quarter
of a mile. Considerable damage would
be inflicted on all areas within a mile.
Light frame structure would be demol-
ished for several miles and windows in
large buildings would probably be com-
pletely shattered.
The loss of life within the area of
the atomic explosion would be close to
100 per-cent. Our present bomb would
kill many people within a mile and
cause unending suffering to countless
numbers of persons exposed to radio-
active radiation.
If the present type of atomic bomb
should be dropped on the city of New
York, it is believed that within a mile
or two all the windows would be blown
out, roof structures would take to the
winds and stone facings of the sky-
scrapers would collapse downward car-
rying death and destruction. Casualties
from falling debris, short circuits, fires,
and exploding gas mains would be very
high and chaos and havoc would rage
throughout the area.
If an atomic bomb were exploded un-
der water at the New York piers con-
siderable more damage would be en-
countered. Subways would probably be
destroyed and at least ten square miles
would be rendered uninhabitable be-
cause of the concentrated radioactivity
of the flooding water. Here, too, the
loss of life would be tremendous. Thus
it can be seen that the atomic bomb
(Continued from page 9)
is a destructive weapon not only be-
cause of material losses, but primarily
because the exceedingly high loss of life,
and human suffering encountered there-
after.
At the present time there is no ade-
quate atomic bomb defense. It is true
that no defense is perfect, however, in
the case of the atom bomb the defense
must be perfect to be of any value. Not
one of the V-2 missiles released by the
Germans toward London was shot down.
If several guided missiles carrying atom-
ic bombs were hurled into a city, few
people would be left to describe the un-
happy experience. We might consider
radioactive radiation acting in the same
manner that poisonous gas behaves.
Such radiation does not give a warning
as it approaches, and as a result an un-
suspecting nation could have its cities
destroyed in a relatively short time.
industrial applications
There is little doubt in the minds of
noted engineers and physicists that nu-
clear energy will be harnessed.
From the people who know, nuclear
energy has numerous applications, but
will require years of work and research
before such equipment becomes com-
merically applicable.
At the present time, the greatest field
of nuclear research seems to be centered
around the development of nuclear pow-
er plants. If through the improvement
of design and operating techniques nu-
clear power does become economically
suitable, it would require at least ten
years before any appreciable effect
would be noticed on electricity costs.
Since electricity is not in itself a source
of energy, but only a means of transmit-
ting energy, it is reasonable to say that
nuclear power will supplement present
sources of energy, but will not replace
them.
In dealing with nuclear power, it is
necessary to consider the economic ad-
vantages and disadvantages as well as
the engineering problems and details
An engineer, armed with the necessary
mathematical background and a few as-
sumptions, may arrive at some of the
facts concerning the employment of nu-
clear power in industry. These assump-
tions may someday prove to be false, but
at the present time are substantiated
by sufficient eperimental data and physi-
cal facts. On this basis, the use of nu-
clear power does not prove to be quite
as economical as we have been led to
believe.
To present a clear picture of a nu-
clear power system, it is best to com-
pare it with our present day system of
power generation. The question be-
comes one of oil and coal versus urani-
um. Present day indications are that
the nuclear power plant will be con-
structed to generate between 100,000
and 200,00 kilowatts. Because of the
radioactivity present in the immediate
vicinity of such a generator, consider-
able shielding will be required. As a
result, it appears that small power
plants would not be commercially feasi-
ble or economically profitable. Our
imaginary nuclear power plant would
use natural uranium, which contains
about 0.7% by weight of the active U
235 istope. Approximately 80,000 kilo-
watt-hours of energy are available from
a pound of uranium. The losses due to
radiation and various internal losses
produce an efficiency of 25% in the con-
version of thermal energy into electrical
energy. Thus 20,000 kilowatt-hours of
electricity would be produced from one
pound of natural uranium.
It is believed that the cost of a pound
of uranium will vary from twenty-five
to fifty dollars. However with mass
production methods, the cost eventually
will be reduced considerably. Even
though this price represents the cost per
pound, there are certain fission products
formed in the bombardment of U 235
by neturons, which will in effect reduce
the final cost. Among these products
are barium and krypton. Because of the
formation of these fission products, ad-
ditional expense is involved.
The uranium is in the form of an
enriched pile. The pile consists of the
uranium, plus a moderator, usually of
low atomic weight, to reduce the speed
of the reaction, and to aid in maintain-
ing the chain reaction. Both materials
are contained in an enormous lead vat,
and water is piped through constantly.
The water absorbs the heat of reaction,
turns to steam, and then is utilized in
the familiar steam-turbine. The fission
products formed around the pile will re-
tard the action of the uranium in the
same manner that a cumulative ash re-
duces the percentage of combustion in a
coke furnace. In effect, the pile would

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


HERE'S a new kind of pipe. It carries
microwaves. It began to take shape in
college.
A student was experimenting with the
transmission of very short radio waves over
wires immersed in a trough of water. The
waves travelled along the wires as expected,
but then he discovered a second set of waves
in the trough—a set dependent not on the
wires, but guided by the trough itself.
Several years later this student, then a
scientist at the Bell Telephone Laboratories,
became interested in the transmission of
microwaves. He recalled his college experi-
ment. Could a metal sheath be substituted
for the trough? Would such a pipe line carry
high frequency radio waves with greater
efficiency than an ordinary line?
It could and it would: but the wave lengths
available required pipe lines that were
too bulky to be practical. Electron tubes
were soon developed which generated shorter
waves . . . waves which made it possible to
use pipe lines of smaller, more manageable
size. These pipe lines, known as wave-
guides, proved indispensable to radar in war.
Now, with the invention of accessories to
serve as coils and capacitors of wire circuits,
waveguides are becoming an even more
important part of our radio telephone and
television systems.
Such men as this young scientist whose
keen minds can recall early observations and
apply them intelligently to new problems
will find telephony a fascinating and a re-
warding career.

PROBLEM — You are designing a machine for doing finishing
operations on the production line, such as grinding, polish-
ing, buffing, etc. Your problem is to provide a drive that
permits the grinding or polishing wheel to be moved around
freely while it is running. How would you do it?
THE SIMPLE SOLUTION —Use an S.S.White power drive flex-
ible shaft to transmit rotary power from a suspended or
pedestal-mounted electric motor to the handpiece which
holds the finishing wheel. This gives you a portable unit
that permits the wheel to be readily manipulated to reach
all points.

replace the boiler, stoker, draft machin-
ery, fuel storage, fuel handling devices,
and the ash-disposal equipment.
Since the pile will be completely
radioactive, it will be necessary to pro-
vide some means for handling the in-
tensely radioactive materials without en-
dangering the health of the operating
personnel. This would require remote
operation of the pile, to remove the fis-
sion products and to repurify the urani-
um. If the control devices should fail,
they could not be repaired because they
too would be radioactive.
At the present time, the size of the
pile is the most important engineering
consideration. In order for the reac-
tions in a pile to be self-sustaining, the
pile must be constructed above a certain
minimum size. The size of the pile has
not been definitely stated, but it is in
the order of several tons. If the pile
were small, the loss of the reaction-
causing neutrons would be extremely
large, and continuous reactions would
not be possible. Since ash (fission prod-
ucts) accumulates on the pile, and if
the pile were small, the fission products
would soon absorb so many neutrons
that the reactions would cease. Thus,
the major requirement of the pile is a
reasonably constant rate of energy re-
lease, which involves a large mass of
fissionable material, and a movable neu-
tron absorber. The accumulation of ash
could be counteracted by the removal
of absorbers until eventually the reac-
tion ceases. This would require a shut-
down of the pile, in order to repurify
the uranium. By increasing the amount
of U 235, the critical size for self-
sustaining reaction would become small-
er. However, this process is too costly
to be employed in the use of power
generation.
Because of the exceedingly high cost
of the atomic pile, it appears that nu-
clear power for automobiles is impossi-
ble for quite some time. Since a nuclear
power plant would require extensive
shielding to protect passengers from
radioactive radiation, and would raise
the bulk of the automobile to absurd
proportions, it is not likely that nuclear
power plants will be used for small ve-
hicles, and probably not for aircraft or
locomotives. However, for merchant
vessels, where conservation of space is
of primary importance, some type of
nuclear energy plant is possible.

contour and structure of the specimen.
From this the need for complicated
methods of specimen preparation is
seen. Only a brief outline of some of
these methods will be given here. For
detailed descriptions of applications of
these methods to special problems the
reader is referred to issues, dating as
far back as 1940, of the major scientific
journals, including: Journal of Applied
Physics, Proceedings of the Society of
Biological Medicine, Review of Science
Institute, Physics Review, and Indus-
trial and Engineering Chemistry.
Every specimen requires at least the
wire mesh described above for support
and most specimens require additional
support. This is usually in the form of
a thin film that is structure-free within
the resolving power of the microscope.
Collodion, which is typical of the organ-
ic films, is diluted with amyl acetate;
then several drops are placed on the sur-
face of distilled water in a large shallow
dish. When the amyl acetate evaporates
it leaves a thin film of collodion, about
200 A. in thickness, on the surface.
ELECTRON MICROSCOPE
(Continued from page 11)
Several of the discs of wire mesh are
placed on the film and then the film and
the disks are picked up with a glass
microslide. Since water does not wet
collodion it dries away from the film
and removes all foreign material in the
process. A wire mesh with collodion
substrate will hereafter be referred to as
a specimen screen.
Samples of the material to be studied
may be placed on the specimen screen in
a variety of ways depending on the na-
ture of the material.
In fig. 1 the specimen screen was
merely passed through the smoke of
magnesium burning in air. In some
cases, it is desirous to oxidize or burn
the material in a partial vacuum and
then to heat it with an electric filament
to control the size of the particles. Some
of the smokes such as carbon black and
gold black can be made to form long
chains out from the mesh wires and can
be examined without a supporting mem-
brane.
Quite often it is convenient to make
a colloidal suspension of the material
in distilled water or some other liquid
and then to place a microdrop of the
solution on a specimen screen. When
the liquid dries away the residue can be
examined. The choice of a liquid medi-
um depends on the action of the liquid
on the material and on the film, and also
on the amount and type of residue it
leaves. If it is desired to use an organic
solvent, silica films may be used. These
films are prepared by evaporating silica
in a vacuum onto collodion films and
then removing the collodion with amyl
acetate.
A great deal of investigation has been
done on evaporated metal films during
the past few years which was not possi-
ble before the development of the elec-
tron microscope, when using an instru-
ment equipped with a diffraction camera
of the microscope's specimen chamber.
Evaporated metal films may be pre-
pared by distilling the metal to be
studied from a hot filament in a vacuum
onto to a specimen screen.

The stewardess stood calmly at the head
of the cabin. "Because of adverse flight
conditions, we are landing at Newark
Airport instead of LaGuardia."
Up in the nose of the plane, the pilot
squinted through heavy fog. Slowly he
pushed the wheel forward and the plane
headed down into the pea soup.
Then he saw them. Tiny pinpoints of
clear light, glinting through the thick
haze. He guided the plane down between
the rows of lights and in a matter of
seconds it was safely on the ground.
Flying in pea soup is never easy. But the
worst part of it used to be landing in a
blinding glare barrage caused by the
runway markers lighting up the fog.
During the war a leading manufacturer
of airport lighting asked Corning to help
them design a new runway light that
could penetrate any kind of weather
without glare. The result was an intricate
lamp globe which controls the beam so
the pilot sees the light but not the halo.
Corning research has helped aviation in
many other ways. Newark's big Bartow
air beacon was made from five special
glass lenses at Corning. "Black Light"
lamps and housings that cause aircraft
instrument panels to glow softly at night
are all made of Corning glass, as are
the little glass jewels in the instru-
ments themselves. Wingtip lights and
radio tubes are two more examples.
Altogether we have over 50,000 different
glass formulae. Maybe one of them will
come to your rescue when you're stewing
over some problem in your new job.

mind after graduation. Corning Glass

metallic films a method to increase the
contrast of specimens. This is especially
necessary for those specimens that have
approximately the same density as the
collodion film, and also have very small
dimensions compared to the thickness of
the collodion film, resulting in a slight
difference in scattering by specimens on
the surface of the collodion. They
found that if a thin film of gold or
chromium (ten to forty A.U.) is de-
posited obliquely on a specimen screen
with specimens on it, the.metal will be
deposited uniformly on the clean collo-
dion film. But it will pile up on the
front surface of any material on the
screen, so that the specimen casts a
"shadow" to the leeward side where no
metal is deposited. Thus sharper dif-
ferentiation of variations in structure is
obtained, besides giving depth to the
micrographs. Fig. 2 shows a shadowed
paratyphoid bacillus. The flagella, by
which the bacilli probably propel them-
selves are clearly indicated.
The surfaces of bones, dentines, and
metals may be studied by the use of
indirect replica techniques. Fig. 3 shows

photomicrographs of shadowed replicas
that were made by dropping a globule of
dilute collodion on the surface of the
br;ll bearing race and allowing the drop-
let to spread over the surface, thus
forming a thin film. The collodion fills
in all the irregularities on the surface,
and when stripped off gives a negative
replica of the surface.
Fig. 4 represents a shadowed Form-
var replica of a chromium-nickel alloy,
etched with a solution of copper sul-
phate in hydrochloric acid. Formvar
replicas are made in exactly the same
way as collodion replicas.
While far from complete, the preced-
ing paragraphs give some description of
the present scope of electron microsco-
py. Although few major technical ad-

sistance to research workers in the bio-
logical, chemical, and metallurgical

Why some things get better all the time
Health, strength and zest for life—of youngsters, of work-
ers, of all of us—depend on food. Food produced by the mil-
lions of tons yearly. And each year our farmers have more
efficient means to do their tremendous job.
The modern farmer has a tractor, a truck, and uses
specialized farm tools—all with parts made increasingly of
alloy-toughened steels and of plastics, for sturdier, more
efficient service. His milking machine has parts of rust-
resistant stainless steel. Chemically fortified feeds grow
healthier livestock. New chemical sprays protect his crops
from insects and plant diseases. And improved fertilizers
restore vital elements to his soil.
From care of the life-giving soil to precious harvest, the
farmer's means for food production are steadily improving
... because into these means go better and belter materials.
Producing belter materials for the use of science and
industry and the benefit of mankind is the work of Union
Carbide.
Basic knowledge and persistent research are required,
particularly in the fields of science and engineering. Work-
ing with extremes of heat and cold—frequently as high as
6000° or as low as 300° below zero, Fahrenheit—and with
vacuums and great pressures, Units of UCC now separate
or combine nearly one-half of the many elements of the
earth.

Effect of Vanadium on the variation in tensile strength of an alloy cast iron.
graphite flakes. This favorable influence
on the structure of cast iron increases
tensile strength, and raises the elastic
ratio without lowering the ductility ma-
terially. It also increases the dynamic
strength of steel, resistance to shock,
fatigue, and resistance to abrasion.
When an iron not containing vana-
dium is used, the designer is forced to
base his design calculations on the low-
est ultimate stress of a given iron stock,
the tensile strengths of which usually
vary over a range of several thousand
pounds per square inch. On the other
hand, with iron containing vanadium,
the ultimate stress (and consequently
the design stress) can be raised and at
the same time the new stress very nearly
approximates the actual value of each
part of the iron stock. This is a highly
desirable feature of irons containing va-
nadium.
Most of the world's supply of vana-
dium comes from the United States and
Peru. The other foreign producing ter-
ritories of importance, besides Peru, are
Mexico and Africa. The metal has been
found to a limited extent in the Permian
beds of Germany and Russia, and the
bauxite deposits of France and the cop-
per deposits of Russia also contain some
vanadium. The Peruvian ore is "pa-
tronite," a dark slate-like sulfide mined
in and around Mina Ragra, Peru, at an
elevation of 15,000 feet in the Andes
Mountains.
Mining at Mina Ragra is highly selec-
tive, since the deposit contains a wide
variety of vanadium ores, each requiring
a separate metallurgical treatment in
the reduction plants. The element is
formed in red shales, in pure crystals of
a yellow oxide, called "pascoite," and in
several compounds. The different ores
are separated at the mine and loaded
in mine cars at Mina Ragra for trans-
portation to the seacoast. The concen-
trating plants are located there, where
the ores are rough crushed and after-
wards ground into a fine powder. They
are then roasted in giant kilns, and
leached in water, and then in sulfuric
acid. The resulting vanadium concen-
trate is precipitated from the leach liq-
ours, dried, and finally packaged for
shipment. The core concentrates are
then shipped to America where they are
further processed.
Practically all of the vanadium de-
posits in the United States are found in
Colorado, Arizona, and Utah; however,
recently, several million tons of rela-
tively low-grade material have been
located in Wyoming and Idaho. The
chief ore in this country is called "car-
notite," a mineral of complex structure
whose formula is K20.2 U03.V205.3H20.
This is usually found in sandstone. The
carnotite may be concentrated along
cracks or bedding planes, it may occur
in pockets in nearly pure form, or it
may impregnate the sandstone. An-
other vanadium ore in America is
rosceolite, a vanadium-bearing mica,
occurring in the fissures and brecciated
zones of the deposits of Utah and Colo-
rado.
In steel manufacture vanadium is
added to the molten steel in the form of
ferro-vanadium, the amounts used run-
ning from 1 to 4 pounds per ton of steel.
The ferrovanadium is made either in
the electric furnace or by the Gold-
schmidt thermit process. The main con-
stituent used in these processes is the
black metallic oxide, V205. This is
the product obtained when the vana-
dium ore is originally milled at the
various mines in the Southwest. The
oxide is then shipped to plants located
in the eastern part of the country where
it is used in the production of ferro-
vanadium. The price of ferrovanadium
is about $2.70 per pound of contained
vanadium.
This, in brief, is the saga of va-
nadium. Named after the Goddess of
Beauty, Vanadis, the element was ap-
propriately christened. The reference to
beauty was originally made because of
the brilliantly colored solutions vanadi-
um compounds formed. Now, however,
the beauty associated with this element
is manifested in a different light. Today
the beauty of vanadium is the spectacu-
lar way in which it, together with all of
the other important alloys, has been
keeping astride with the uncompromis-
ing demands of the industrial world for
stronger materials with which to build
better things for better living.

Uniform heat, at precise temperatures, assures the
constant high quality of Maendler paint brushes.
Three automatic, clock-controlled vulcanizing ovens
guarantee the exact time-temperature relationship for
sealing set-in-rubber bristles; GAS, dependable heat
source for toughest industrial heating problems, in-
sures uniform oven temperatures.
The controllability of GAS proved an asset to
production at the Maendler plant. By charging the
ovens at the end of the normal working day, one
extra vulcanizing cycle can be completed after-hours
. . . with automatic time and safety controls substi-
tuting for the operator.
Efficiency of Gas-Fired Equipment, and economy of
GAS for industrial heating, have been demonstrated

Neither the crags and cliffs of the
Northwest Passage nor a few thousand
miles of Pacific Ocean proved an insur-
mountable obstacle to Don Forman in
his haste to get back to the University
after the war. Considering his election
as president of Tau Beta Pi this semes-
ter, no doubt we should assume that the
motivating impulse for this speedy re-
turn was a desire to embrace his be-
loved engineering books lying at home
in dusty storage.
However, knowing that his home is
in Seattle, Washington, and assuming
any betrothal to books is as doubtful
with him as it is with many of us, we
might hunt for a more appropriate rea-
son. The magnetic force is generated,
we find, by Miss Becky Mayer, a speech
major across campus. Excellent train-
ing she has had, it seems, for Don has
already been talked into the "I do"
mood—date set for September.
Looking back a few years to his high
school days, Don played football for
Queen Anne High School in Seattle, was
Boy's Club president, Eagle Scout, and
member of Hi-Y. Skiing and mountain
climbing filled in spare time and added
uncommon adventure to his early life.
Starting a landslide on Mt. Adams (12.
307 feet, he says) at twelve years of age
did not deter him from reaching the top,
nor did it have any effect on later suc-
cessful waltzes up Mt. St. Helens, and
also Mt. Rainer's 14,000 odd feet.

graduation from high school, Don was

which kept the work dry.
The overall allotted drilling time was
212 days, with two ten hour shifts a
day. The drilling capacities of the ma-
chines used were based on Canadian
Ingersoll Rand equipment. The lineal
drilling feet per yard of rock was cal-
culated. From this data the required
lineal feet of dr.lling per day to meet
the schedule, and the number of ma-
chines needed, and the required air
capacity per day were closely estimated.
The compressed air was furnished by
seven stationary compressors with an
output of 23,310 cu. ft. per min. at 100
psi pressure, plus 16 portable and semi-
portable machines with an output of
8000 cu. ft. per min. Nearly all types
of drills were used, wagon drills were
used mainly at the head channel, power
feel drifters were used for the horizontal
parts of the penstocks. These are power
feed machines mounted en a movable
stage; 24 drills can operate at once.
The first turbine went into operation
18 months after the contractor was
given the authority to begin work, the
job was completed a year later, a total
elapsed time of thiry months.
This job was the biggest rock job
in many years—a total of 3,265,000
yards of rock excavation. In this it was
not typical of all power plant develop-
ments but all of them entail at least
some rock work and the methods used
on this job can be applied on most of
these projects.
The St. Lawrence Seaway project, if
built, will operate on a greater volume
of water but with a smaller head, but
the same general features of head chan-
nels, headblocks, penstocks and tail-races
must be built. The Missouri Valley
Authority project will consist of several
small plants whose operating character-
istics will compare favorably with the
Shipshaw project.

Trainmen inspecting their trains or
otherwise working about them can now
talk with other members of the crew,
the crews of other trains in the area,
and with operators of distant control
towers, through the use of a recently
developed telephone. This instrument
transmits and receives messages through
the air, operating in connection with the
railroad's inductive telephone system for

communication between trains, trains
and towers, and the ends of the trains.
The new unit weighs but 29 pounds
and is housed in a small cabinet. With
it, a trainman can leave his caboose and
still maintain communication with the
other members of the crew.
The new device has proved valuable
to members of the crew making inspec-
tions of the train, enabling them to keep
in touch with the engineman, and pro-
viding a quick means of reporting any-
thing unusual.
Essentially a miniature version of the
telephone transmission and receiving
unit installed on trains, the instrument
can be compared to the walkie-talkie,
except that instead of radio waves it
transmits and receives through the air
by induction, using the track and way-

side wires on poles as its communication
channels. Thus, its messages are con-
fined to the limits of the railroad, and
there is no interference with radio op-
eration in the vicinity.
Tiny storage batteries provide power
for approximately two hours of steady
use.
Since this new, portable, railroad
radio-telephone utilizes the wires and
tracks of the railway to conduct its
messages, rather than depending upon
the •'ether," it will facilitate inter-
train communication in mountainous
areas, and over long distances, and may
prevent head-on collisions, and pile-
ups of fast-moving passenger trains
into stationary ones.
sky-streak
Hot off the drawing board is the
latest and most sensational of the jets,
the Douglas D-558. Driven by the most
powerful turbo-jet engine available in
this country, it is expected to fly in the
transonic region of speed—that region
approaching and including the speed of
sound—and thus provide hitherto un-
obtainable data on air pressures and
forces on an airplane.
The D-558, aptly named the Sky-
streak, was created because existing
wind tunnels were not capable of sup-
plying the desired information and be-
cause construction of more advanced
tunnels would be too costly and time-
consuming. A Navy contract was award-
ed for the construction and testing of
this aircraft, which is designed purely
for research purposes.
As a flying laboratory, the Sky-streak
would be hard to surpass. Five hun-
dred pounds of automatically recording
instruments measure air pressure at 400
separate points on the wing, fuselage,
and tail surfaces and complete load on
the tail and wing.
To get the airplane up to the speed
desired, the General Electric TG-180
turbo-jet engine was selected. The
thrust of this huge engine, which oc-
cupies most of the fuselage, is equiva-
lent to that of seventy-five modern au-
tomobiles.
Extensive use of magnesium alloy in
the fuselage results in a saving of weight
and, at the same time, a greater avail-
able internal volume of the fuselage.
Tests have shown the magnesium to be
more resistant to fire than the conven-
tional aluminum alloy.
The thinness of the wings, which
house the landing gear, made it neces-
sary to design special tires, wheels, and
brakes. The tires have an inflation pres-
sure of 230 pounds per square inch,
eight times that of the average automo-
bile tire.
Attention was given not only to the
aerodynamic features of the airplane;
the safety and comfort of the pilot were
also considered. At the speeds expected,
any attempt by the pilot to bail out in
the conventional manner would be fatal.
Jettisonable seats were considered, but
abandoned because the acceleration
needed to throw the pilot clear of the
tail surfaces and the forces of the air-
stream would be far too violent. Under

Explosives—an essential
industrial tool
Industrial explosives are
as much of a yardstick
of industrial progress as sul-
furic acid. They are in-
volved in the fabrication of
nearly all the products used
by man. This year the
United States will use over
500 million pounds of in-
dustrial explosives.
The technical problems
that confront the explosives
industry are many and va-
ried. A measure of this is
the fact that the Du Pont
Company manufactures
about two hundred dyna-
mite formulations, each in-
tended to do a different job,
from the slow heaving ac-
tion of blasting coal to the
rapid, violent shattering
necessary for a hard ore.
Ranging between these two extremes
are a large number of intermediate
grades, including explosives especially
formulated for agricultural work, seis-
mic prospecting for oil, submarine blast-
ing—right down to the tiny charge
used in an explosive rivet.
Studies in Laboratory and Field
One of the first industrial laboratories
for chemical research in the United
States, the Eastern laboratory of the
Du Pont Explosives Department has
nearly two hundred chemists, engineers,
physicists and assistants. There, meth-
ods have been developed for measuring
the power of explosives, the degree to
which they shatter or pulverize various
materials, their water resistance, their
safety characteristics when exposed to
shock or flame, the composition of the
gases they produce, etc. As a result of
studies of the influence of various fac-
tors on dynamite performance, it has
become possible to formulate an explo-
sive to meet practically any blasting
condition.
In keeping with these improvements,
the application of explosives has reached
a new level of efficiency. Technical serv-
ice men, usually mining engineers or

civil engineers, aid consumers in the
selection and use of explosives. They
also work closely with research men in
solving unusual problems encountered
in the field.
Research—Path to Progress
A few of the results gained through
research are: (1) lowering of dynamite
freezing points by nitrating ethylene
glycol along with glycerol to diminish
the hazards of thawing frozen dyna-
mites. (2) Production of less hazardous
dynamites by substituting ammonium
nitrate partially for nitroglycerine, in
spite of the greater hygroscopicity and
lesser explosive power of the former.
This resulted in dynamites less hazard-
ous to manufacture and use. (3) Intro-
duction of "Nitramon," a blasting agent
containing a high percentage of ammo-
nium nitrate as its major ingredient. It
is equal in strength to the most power-
ful dynamites commonly employed and
yet is by far the safest blasting agent
available. (4) Development of explo-
sives with a minimum of noxious gases
for use in confined areas. (5) Numerous
improvements in the composition, man-
ufacture and design of the blasting
caps which set off the main charge.

Aside from these developments in
explosives and blasting supplies, there
have been many accomplishments in
chemistry and engineering associated
with such projects as the oxidation of
ammonia to nitric acid; manufacture,
granulation and drying of ammonium
nitrate; substitutes for nitroglycerine
and ethylene glycol dinitrate, concen-
tration of nitric and sulfuric acids, and
a host of other subjects.

whole forward section of the fuselage is
jettisoned, and when the section has
slowed down to the speed of a falling
body, the pilot bails out in the normal
fashion.
Friction and the sun's heat would
cause the temperature in the cockpit to
reach 180 degrees Fahrenheit on a hot
day near sea level, so a cooling system
was provided. This same equipment
heats the pilot's compartment on cooler
days and at higher altitudes. The pilot's
compartment is pressurized to avoid loss
of pilot efficiency when using oxygen at
higher altitudes.
Actually, taken as a whole, the con-
struction of the D-558 is comparatively
conventional. It was designed not as a
new type, but rather as an instrument
for obtaining aerodynamic data. As
tests progress and the Skystreak pro-
vides more scientific knowledge, this
airplane will be directly responsible for
the design of safer, more efficient air-
craft which will out-perform anything
in the air today.

sound and noise
Sound reduction is an ever-present
problem in this modern world. High
noise levels affect the efficiency of work-
ers and, in many instances, the vibra-
tions which cause noise also affect the
efficiency of machines. The investiga-
tion of sound and noise reduction has
become a definite part of engineering
science and goes under the name of
Acoustics.
The term sound is used in two senses,
subjectively and objectively. "Does one
have to be present to hear in order that
there be sound?" The physiologist may
argue this point with you, since he is
interested in the auditory sensation ex-
perienced by the ear—a subjective view-
point. On the other hand, the engineer
is primarily concerned with the vibra-
tory motion which gives rise to that sen-
sation. This is objective sound.
Sound waves have several character-
istics. In fact, all waves, save electro-
magnetic waves, possess the following
characteristics:
a. They require a medium for their
propagation.
b. They have finite velocity.
c. They are reflected.
d. They are refracted.
e. They are diffracted.
f. They may interfere.
Wave motion may be of many kinds.
Ocean waves sweep over the water sur-
face; vibrating bodies are distorted by
wave surges; electromagnetic waves
transmit X-Rays, light, and Bob Hope
every Tuesday night. These wave mo-
tions are based on several principles.
When one throws a stone into a pond,
the water does not move as a whole but
some configuration of the surface does.
The motion is caused by vibrations of
individual particles over short ranges,
all the particles having the same kind of
motion. The most familiar waves are
those in which the particles oscillate
along lines perpendicular to the direc-
tion of the propagation of the wave.
These are called transverse waves. On
the other hand, in sound waves the

agation of the wave and are called longi-
tudinal waves.
Some sounds are undesirable. To that
group the name "noise" has been given.
For instance, some sounds are undesir-
able because they have an injurious
effect upon the nervous system. They
may mask other desirable sounds such
as speech or music; they may produce
mechanical failure of devices by forced
vibrations in any medium.
The human ear is man's best basis for
determining the desirability of sounds.
A variety of terms is employed in ordi-
nary language to convey sound impres-
sion; these include, for instance, squeal,
howl, whistle, rustle, rumble, and hum.
Most of these sounds would be classi-
fied as "noises," in contrast with those
spoken of as "tones." The chief distinc-
tion is the regularity of vibration of the
source and the degree of damping. For
example, the complex sounds of speech
are formed by grouping the prolonged
vowel tones and the impulsive launch-
ing and quenching of these tones by the
consonants. The ear can distinguish
THE TECHNIC EXPLORES
(Continued from page 36)
between tones differing in "pitch," in
"loudness," and in "quality." Each of
these characteristics is associated with
one of the properties of the sounding
body. Pitch is a function of frequency
of vibration; loudness, of sound inten-
sity; and, quality, of the nature of vi-
brations and overtones present.
A comparison of the principal fea-
tures of the ear and the microphone,
both acting as sound receivers, readily
supplies one with a practical under-
standing of the hearing process.
For the microphone, the pressure of
the sound is the excitation; the response
is the electromagnetic force. Both of
these quantities are physical quantities.
Sound pressure is also the excitation for
the ear, but, here, the response is sen-
sation. The exciting element is an act-
ual physical quantity, but the response,
in contrast to the response of the mike,
is entirely a subjective one. The output
of a microphone is expressed in terms of
response per unit of incident pressure;
i.e, millivolts per dynes per square centi-
meter of pressure. However, the expres-
sion for mental response of the ear in
similar units of sensation per units of
stimulus is not so easy. The sensitivity
of the ear is not independent of fre-
quency nor is it independent of the
size of the stimulus. However, an ac-
cepted rule of psychophysics is the We-
ber-Fechner law which applies within
limits to all the sense organs. It re-
quires that "equal increments of sen-
sation are associated with equal incre-
ments of the logarithm of the stimulus."
Consequently, if the law is applied to
the ear, then loudness varies with the
logarithm of intensity. This logarithmic
relation between loudness and intensity
has given rise to the logarithmic method
of expressing sound intensities. "Inten-
sity level" measures intensity and the
"bel" is the unit of intensity.
The bel is defined as the fundamental
division of the logarithmic scale for ex-
pressing the ratio of two amounts of
power. Owing to its size, the bel is not
used as much as is the decibel. This
unit, equal to one-tenth of the bel is,
db = 10 log!

International control, through the
United Nations, of the production and
use of fissionable material, which can
release atomic energy, is probably the
paramount problem before that organ-
ization today. For, on the one hand, if
atomic energy can be exploited in peace-
ful uses in a world freed from fear of
the atomic bomb, the possibilities for a
better and more abundant life are
tremendous. The burning of two or
three pounds of atomic fuels a day
would supply all the power requirements
of Detroit or Pittsburgh; about twenty
pounds a day would furnish all the elec-
trical energy now used in England. It
is hardly necessary to dwell on what
this possibility could mean to England
with its dwindling coal production, or
what it could mean in any situation
where power is vitally needed but where
ordinary power supplies are inadequate
because of remote location, transporta-
tion difficulties, or practical limitations
on space or weight. On the other hand,
if through controls worked out by the
United Nations, we cannot insure, be-
yond question, that fissionable materials
will be employed exclusively for peace-
ful uses and will not be made into
bombs, then the peace of the world
will be under constant threat.
The atomic bomb is at least a thou-
sand times more powerful than the
biggest block buster used in World War
II. From the effects of the bombs
dropped at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, we
know that such a bomb bursting in the
air over a modern city would devastate
an area of at least four square miles. In-
deed, fires were started in Japan at dis-
tances as great as two miles. Even a
greater threat than the explosive force or
the heat of the bomb is the resulting ra-
dioactivity. The burst of gamma radia-
tion which is emitted at the instant of ex-
plosion will fatally injure most human
beings directly exposed to it at distances
out to about a mile, and those at as
much as twice that distance will suffer
more or less damage and sickness. At
the Bikini tests, we saw that radioactive
fission products—the new atoms pro-
duced— which rise and escape with the
mushroom cloud when the bomb is ex-
ploded in air, are trapped in a huge
water column when the bomb is ex-
ploded under-water and fall back into
the water or roll outward with the base
surge of fog and mist. This base surge,
forming as the water column fell, was
over five hundred feet high and moved
outward at the rate of fifty miles an
hour to drench everything within a radi-
us of a mile or more. A breath or two
of such a cloud of mist would carry a
lethal dose of radioactive poisons and
the moving cloud would deposit on
everything it touched radioactive ma-
terial which would be almost impossible
to remove or neutralize and which would
make the area uninhabitable for months
or years. An underwater burst in any
great harbor, such as New York or San
Francisco or London, could completely
paralyze the city.
Clearly, in a world where such a
threat exists life could never be normal
or really peaceful. The United States
would be obliged to maintain a state of
military preparedness and a military
establishment on a far greater scale
than we have ever known in peace time.
Not peace, but only an armed truce
would exist. Nor could we wait, as we
have done in the past, for an actual
physical attack as evidence of hostile
intent. Any evidence of an atomic bomb
test or detonation anywhere in the
world, or even reliable intelligence that
active material for bombs was being
produced might have to be a cause for
instant action on our part, since delay
might well spell disaster.
Fortunately for our peace of mind, it
is possible to use the power of the atom
for peaceful purposes and yet make cer-
tain that it cannot be used in atomic
bombs. The Baruch plan, based on the
Acheson-Lilienthal report which, in turn,
was based on the studies of some of our
best experts in the field, has shown that
the production of the fissionable isotopes
of plutonium or uranium can be inter-
rupted while the materials are still in an
impure or "denatured" form—a form in
which they are satisfactory for power
and heat production but are not satis-
factory for bombs. The technical com-
mittee of the United Nations, compris-
ing scientists from all the nations on the
Security Council, among which is Rus-
sia, reported a similar finding to the
United Nations. Both these groups
agreed that it was perfectly feasible to
set up inspection procedures which
would insure that no plants for carrying
out the final denaturing or purification
existed and that, therefore, no danger-
ous or explosive fissionable material was
being produced. The scientists of all
nations agreed that this control proce-
dure is completely workable and, fur-
thermore, that it is the only way to in-
sure control of the atomic bomb.
This inspection procedure is the es-
sence of the Baruch plan. No satisfac-
tory alternative has ever been seriously
advanced. No one has confidence in in-
ternational agreements on bomb control
based only on promises or declarations.
The United States has insisted, and
rightly, that agreement to this inspec-
tion procedure and the actual establish-
ment of such adequate control and in-
spection processes are a prerequisite to
disarmament discussions or to our turn-
ing over our bomb secrets or materials
to the United Nations. Our national
safety and national interest demand this
course of action on our part. Moreover,
the whole world realizes that this policy
is the guarantee of world peace for the
next few years; while we hold the bomb
no aggressor will attack us, and our
traditions insure against aggression on
our part. By insisting on the inspection
plan, the United States gains nothing
except national safety and the assurance
of world peace which the other peoples
of the world need even more desperately
than we. To weaken our position, to be
diverted from it by uninformed, short
sighted, or selfish interests, whether at
home or abroad, would be to court dis-
aster.

MAKING AN ART
A SCIENCE
G-E Research helps to modernize
the craft of Varnish Making
Rembrandt and Frans Hals were pio-
neers in the varnish industry. For it was
tiie old masters of the Dutch and Flem-
ish schools who discovered that boiled
linseed oil. mixed with color pigments,
provided an excellent paint vehicle.
For nearly 400 years, linseed oil. with
a few other materials (like rosin, metal
salts of rosin, tung oil, and asphalt),
remained the basis of the paint and
varnish maker's formulations.
Then came tnanv technical advances.

New and remarkable synthetic materials
began to replace time-honored formulas.
And a leader in the research which was
to change an ancient art to a modern
science was General F.lectric.
Insulating Copper Wire
General Electrics interest in varnishes
and resins begins with its interest in cop-
per wire—essential component of mo-
tors, generators, and all power-produc-
ing and distributing apparatus. Many
a good engineer has perspired freely
over problems incident to insulating
copper windings. Early enamels used for
the purpose were considered satisfactory
if, with careful handling, they would
adhere to the wire at least until the
operations involved in winding the coils
were completed.
Present synthetic wire enamels, de-
veloped by General Electric's Resin and
Insulation Materials Division, are spe-
cially designed for each size and type of
wire. Their superiority to older types
is so great that revolutionary changes
in motor assembly have been made pos-
sible by their use.

General Electric's research work in this
field has ?one far bevond the study of
insulating varnishes. Among the most
notable G-E developments ate Glyptal
alkyd resins. Glyptal alkvd resins were
originally produced more than thirty

years ago in General Electric's Pittsfield
Works Laboratory. Since then, they
have been vastly improved and their use
expanded 10 make possible many types
of baking enamels and paints that pro-
vide amazing durability and toughness.
The Future of Silicones
And now, with General Electric's in-
terest in new tvpes of resin and varnish
research expanding, much emphasis is
being placed upon the study of silicones.
Up in Waterford, N.Y.. General Electric
is rushing to completion a new plant
which will turn out silicones in quan-
tity. These amazing products of organo-
silicon chemistry are characterized by
hiirh resistance to heat and cold. Silicone

rubber, silicone oil. silicone greases, sili-
cone resins for paints and varnishes, are
all expected to have many uses where
this ability to withstand temperature
extremes is important.

One of the most fascinating aspects of our work in developing
new resins and insulating materials derives from the competitive
position of our many products. For example, silicones and other
new materials are already vying with older, established lines ami
with each other. With so many new anil interesting developments,
opportunities for younger technical men are most attractive.

OlQCKECQCKSULD


Once upon a time an enormous elk with out-size
antlers roamed the Irish forests. He was impressive
but impractical; concentration of weight in the
wrong place ruined his ability to meet competition.
The same thing can happen in modern machinery.
Too much weight, especially in parts subject to
rapid operation, can reduce efficiency consider-
ably. The machine may not become extinct, but it
won't make many friends.
There is a simple, economical way of avoiding
such troubles — specifying molybdenum steels.
Their hardenability permits weight reduction with
no sacrifice in ability to meet service requirements.

If you made a guess, here's how close to being right you were. Of the six
mentioned industries, the oil industry ranks first in formalized pension plans,
group life insurance coverage, paid vacations for salaried employees and paid
holidays for hourly employees. The industry places second in paid vacations
for hourly employees and paid holidays for salaried workers.
The more you know about the oil business, the more you realize that
petroleum is one of the progressive industries.
Employee benefit plans have been in force at Standard Oil of Indiana for many
years. They are under continuous study with an eye to improving them—
and to keeping them well abreast of changing social and economic conditions.
At the start of 1947, our Vacation Plan was again revised. Under the new
provisions all 15-year employees will have three weeks' vacation every year,
and all 25-year employees will have four weeks—and the vacation policy has
undergone several other liberalizing changes. Recently, too, we put into
effect a new liberal Group Life Insurance Plan for employees. A new Death
Benefits Plan for annuitants will increase considerably the payments made
to dependents.
An employee who faces the future with confidence is a loyal and efficient
employee. To give our employees that confidence, we endeavor to supply all
proper safeguards of an enlightened social economy. At the same time, we
provide the incentive of advancement through accomplishment—which is
the keystone of the system of free enterprise.

direction finder
Pointing the way to sea and air-lane
peacetime safety, the war-fostered elec-
tronics development of "huff duff"
(high-frequency direction-finding) has
proved to be the forerunner of numer-
ous high-frequency radio wave naviga-
tional instruments. The h-f d-f direc-
tion finder is now employed by the
Coast Guard in its air-sea rescue system,
enabling dispatch of a rescue team to
the scene of an emergency with utmost
speed.
Triggered by either voice or code
short-wave radio transmissions, the in-
strument gives almost instantaneous
visual indication of the direction from
which the signals approach the receiver.
Aboard ship or plane the cathode ray
tube gives a navigator directional bear-
ings on fixed shore stations operating at
trans-oceanic ranges. Ashore, the inter-
sections of two bearings from a pair of
h-f d-f stations can direct the search
for a ship or plane sounding an SOS.
Numerous tales of the military ac-
complishments of "huff duff" have been
released by Army and Navy officials.
German squirt broadcasts—radio trans-
mission in split-second bursts—were
believed by the enemy high command
to be undetectabale. The electronic
direction finder, however, put the finger
on the broadcast, oftentimes a sub-
marine transmitting weather reports or
communicating with other units of a
wolf-pack.
Navy reports tell the dramatic story
of one such weather reporting subma-
rine operating 500 miles north of the
Azores. On Christmas Day, 1944, Task
Group 22.8 received orders to hunt
down and destroy the U-boat. Direc-
tion finder bearings on 1 January, 1945,
placed the sub only 40 miles from the
task group. Persistent tracking closed
the distance to six miles, as indicated by
a final transmission on January 16.
Two hours after the intercept, the sonar
operator reported contact. Five hours
after the intercept a violent explosion
indicated the end of another U-boat.
German submarines which landed spies
and saboteurs on both Long Island and
Florida in 1942 were picked up by the
Navy using h-f d-f.
closing circuit breakers
The closing and tripping of circuit
breakers is a major occupation in
present-day industry. At present there
are three methods used in closing cir-
cuit breakers; 1. manual operation; 2.
electrical (solenoid or motor driven);
3. pneumatic.
Generally speaking, manually-con-
trolled circuit breakers are the cheapest,
simplest, and the most reliable. In the
manual closing of circuit breakers, a
series of lines and linkages is used to
overcome the force exerted by the
springs in the mechanism. Many meth-
ods of mechanical arrangements are used
for manually tripping circuit breakers,
depending on the specification, size, and
purpose of the equipment.
Electrically-controlled circuit breakers
are usually solenoid or motor-operated.
Since the solenoid dispenses with the
use of mechanical linkage it is more
desirable. Solenoids are usually de-
signed for d.c. operation, but where
only a.c. power is available dry-disk
full-wave rectifiers are used for the
rectification of the a.c.
Most solenoid breakers are operated
at 120 volts d.c. or 220 volts a.c. Volt-
ages as low as 12 volts have been used
for tripping circuit breakers; however,
the large currents required with such a
low voltage supply would increase the
line loss considerably and require spe-
cial design considerations.
One of the newest methods of closing
circuit breakers is by the use of a
pneumatic cylinder. The pneumatic
cylinder replaces the solenoid, but some
form of electrical solenoid is used to
regulate the air pressure in the cylinder.
To insure reliable operation the air must
be dry and must be supplied under con-
stant pressure.

brooklyn fans
Fifty-three great fans, capable of
supplying and removing hourly 25,000
tons of air will ventilate New York
City's Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel when
it is completed. These fans, when op-
erated at full speed, will be capable of
completely changing the air in the tun-
nel every one-and-one-half minutes.
Construction of the tunnel was re-
sumed last November after nearly three
years' interruption brought in by war-
time shortages. When completed, its
twin tubes. 31 feet in diameter and one-
and-three-quarter miles long will con-
stitute the longest underwater ventilated
vehicular tunnel in the United States.
Twenty-seven supply fans, delivering
air through openings near the floor of
the tunnel roadway, and twenty-six ex-
haust fans, drawing through vents in
the ceiling, will maintain a continuous
upward flow of fresh air.
mobile substations
Fifteen mobile unit substations, every
one for domestic utility, are now under
construction. This apparatus is recog-
nized as essential equipment on modern
electric systems, not only for emergency
service but also for use during mainte-
nance of rebuilding of regular substa-
tions.
Typical of the fifteen units now under
construction is the 2500 kilovolt-
ampere unit, which engineers state is
representative of the type that has more
or less set the standards for future mo-
bile unit substation designs. The 22-ton
unit is low-slung and streamlined, which
serves to reduce cleaning upkeep and
provides a definite safety factor by
shielding the operators from high volt-
ages.
The unit has an overall length of 25
feet and a width of 8 feet, which is
within the maximum dimensions permit-
ted by the highway laws of most states.

Performance data on a new feather-
weight aircraft engine intended for the

boon to the industry. Developing 125
horsepower at 2500 r.p.m. and 110
horsepower at 2200 r.p.m., the four-cyl-
inder powerplant weighs in at less than
200 pounds with consequent rating of
about 1.5 pounds per horsepower.

for and importance of bearings capable
of meeting new conditions of speed, pre-
cision, load capacity and endurance.
Then the same bearings that have con-
sistently and successfully anticipated so
many revolutionary developments for
more than 48 years, again will rise to
the occasion with the same versa-
tility and efficiency — Timken Tapered

Sooner or later, you, and I do mean
you, will come face to face wit;h the
problem of finding a job. What's more,
you will have to plan on holding onto
that or other jobs most of the time for
the next 30 to 50 years!
A disagreable or frightening prospect?
It doesn't need to be. It can be the most
interesting game you will ever play if
you get the right kind of start. The
rewards are literally without limit. Yes
you can actually "write your own
ticket." You can—at least so long as
our present form of government con-
tinues—set almost any salary goal you
want and get it ... if ... .
"Ah!"—you say. I knew there was a
catch someplace. Why the "if"? The
"if" in this case is a very simple one and
any engineer equipped with enough
mental capacity to complete four years
at a good college or university has "what
it takes" to dispose of this particular
"if."
Permit me to back away from this
"if" for a moment and by a personal ex-
ample point to a program which can
mean more to you than you would get
from taking any 10-hour college course
you can name.
The writer was lucky! He graduated
from an engineering college during the
darkest days of the depression—mid-
1932. Never was there a better time to
graduate. The plunge was a cold one
to be sure. For six months not one
single job could be turned up. Compan-
ies everywhere said, "It has cost us
thousands of dollars to train our men.
It wouldn't make sense to hire a young
squirt like you when we are forced to
lay off many of the men who have been
with us for years and years." In one
case, I offered to move 1,000 miles at
my own expense and work without any
salary at all just to get some experi-
ence with a big nationally-known com-
pany in the field of my choice. Finally,
a job was turned up—at a salary of
less than $19 per week—$960 per year.
Tough going, yes, but what satisfac-
tion when, in the short space of fifteen
years, that same company which would
not even give me a job at which I

George W. Meek
offered to work for nothing, made me as-
sistant to the president and offered me
a vice-presidency to boot!
I said I was lucky. I was lucky in
that the cold shock of the years 1932-
1936 taught me that, in the main, these
four principles can be counted on to
assure a high level of earnings for any
one of you. Here they are, and don't
laugh at their seeming simplicity!
1st. There is plenty of room at the
top!
2nd. Generally, a person gets paid
just about what he is worth!
3rd. The only way to get paid more
is to be worth more!
4th. One of the best ways to help
make yourself worth more is to keep an
eye on your "Index of Giving."
Let's now look at those points one
at a time. First, this idea that there
is plenty of room at the top. The in-
creasing complexity of modern business
resulting partly from intensified com-
petition and partly from the increasingly
large part played in our daily lives by
both the government and organized la-
bor places a load on management's
shoulders which is almost greater than
the human frame can bear. The increas-
ing complexities of the labor picture
need no comment and even though the
newspapers report the government is
going to reduce the number of reports
which must be filed by business from
6,000 down to 4,000, there is little in-
dication that the shocking death toll on
the part of our executives from sheer
overwork will materially decrease. Never
in the history of business has manage-
ment been so overburdened as it is to-
day, and never has it been so desperate-
ly in need of qualified help from younger
hands!
Obviously, there are individual com-
panies in which "the old man" rules the
roost with an iron hand and runs, for
all practical purposes, a one-man show
that does not encourage the sharing of
responsibility. Such companies, fortu-
nately, are relatively few and far be-
tween and will get fewer, not only as
the old men die off, but as the business
picture becomes still more complex. But,
from my experience with five different
organizations in the past fifteen years.
I can only repeat that I have been
amazed at the manner in which top
management extended a welcoming hand
to all of those young men who showed
that they had something to offer in the
way of bearing top management's bur-
dens.
Secondly, the statement that a per-
son gets paid just about what he is
worth needs very little comment. While
there are again exceptions—such as re-
sult from having a rich uncle or mar-
rying the boss' daughter—the rule gen-
erally holds.
The really important point, and the
one which few people fully appreciate,
is the idea that to get paid more, you
must be worth more. Recently, a young
draftsman was invited to give his opin-
ion on a company matter somewhat re-
moved from his daily routine. His re-
joinder was, "I am not paid to give
opinions, but am only paid for drafting."
That young chap will continue to get
paid what he is worth, but he won't be
worth very much. Just as regular exer-
cise must precede the building up a
muscle, so must the value of your effort
precede your actual earning rate.

WILLIAM P. CENTZ '49E and ROBERT H. WARE '47E
A very large part of the knowledge
gained in aeronautics has been obtained
from tests of models in artificially pro-
duced airstreams. The reasons for this
fact are many; experiments in flight are
costly and airplanes are commonly
wanted for purposes other than experi-
ment or research; furthermore, it is
possible with an airplane to use only
the complete unit, and the contribution
of each of its parts is not easy to assess.
There are two important differences
between laboratory tests and flying
tests, the first being the difference in
scale between the model and the corre-
sponding part of the airplane, and the
second, the fundamental inability to
reduce the turbulence of an artificial
air current to that of the atmosphere.
For the major effects of air flow, neither
the scale of the model nor the turbu-
lence of the airstream is of any great
importance, but in the course of the de-
velopment of the science of aeronautics,
certain conditions of importance have
come to be recognized as "critical";
that is, have been found to be sensitive
to the exact scale and exact state of
turbulence in which the tests are made.
On both subjects aeronautics owes much
to Osborn Reynolds, and the develop-
ment of the compressed-air wind-tunnel
is a direct outcome of a theory stated
by him and now internationally associ-
ated with his name. The same theory
enables one to draw deductions from
tests in one fluid for application in an-
other; i.e., an experiment may be made
in water and the results used for air
by conversion with the Reynolds' Num-
ber, which will be described later.
Model Aircraft in Wind-Tunnels
Wind-tunnel models are not the works
of some grown-up model builder who
has attained skilled precision in piecing
together balsa wood and tissue paper,
but are the results of the work of expert
model- and pattern-makers. These min-
iature planes are complete in every
detail on the surface, that is. as to
contours, shapes, relative sizes, and pro-
portionality. There is, of course, no fine
detail such as rivet heads, or other
paraphernalia, but there is a small elec-

trie motor driving a propeller in each
engine nacelle, which receives its current
from electrical connections in the
mounting struts. The models are built
of wood, usually of laminated construc-
tion for greater strength, and have a
very smooth finish. As their complexity
has increased, the cost of these models
has followed a steep upward trend, so
that now, for example, the scale wind-
tunnel model of Convair's 204-passen-
ger Model 37 airliner costs $10,000. It
is built of laminated birch and weighs
110 lb.
In the building of wind-tunnels there
are a number of special requirements
that must be satisfied. Some of these
requirements include the following: the
size has to be such as to make the con-
struction of the complete airplane
models relatively simple; operating con-
ditions have to cover speeds up to the
velocity of sound, and also scales or
Reynolds' Numbers, as large as possible;
accuracy has to be extremely high, and
the time required to make the tests and
obtain complete data must be held to
the absolute minimum. In addition,
wide flexibility is required in the types
of tests which can be conducted, and the
transition from tests on one project to
those on another has to be rapidly and
easily made. The latest tunnels incor-
porating these specifications are the Co-
operative Wind-Tunnel being built in
California and an almost identical one
in Buffalo, New York. The cost of each
of these tunnels is approximately $2,-
500,000.
Types of Wind-Tunnels
Wind-tunnels can be classified in two
ways. First, we may consider the rela-
tive positions of the model and the air-
moving unit, with these three sub-divi-
sions:
A) Wind-tunnels with the point of
testing on the downstream side
of the fan.
B) Wind-tunnels with the point of
testing on the suction or up-
stream side of the fan.
C) Wind-tunnels with the circula-
tion of air guided and continuous
(closed circuit).
Secondly, we may consider the type
of restraint of the fluid stream at the
testing station:
a) Wind-tunnels with the air con-
strained by solid walls (closed
return).
b) Wind-tunnels with the flow free:
that is, limited only by the air
surrounding the moving stream
(open return).
There might also be added to the
types of classification the density factor.
Although most tunnels operate under
ordinary atmospheric pressure, some are
completely enclosed and are capable of
taking a working pressure of 25 atmos-
pheres. These tunnels are referred to as
variable-density tunnels.
Wind-tunnel design starts with the
elementary design of a long tube with a
propeller at one end, and the model (let
it be remembered that wing cross-sec-
tion and airfoils are also tested here
and can be considered as the model) is
placed at some point on the inside of
the tube. Fundamentally, that is the
wind tunnel.
With additional improvements such
as a constriction of the tunnel at the
point where the model is placed, to form
the "throat," and a honeycomb struc-
ture placed at the entrance of the air,
the tunnel will approach a useable form.
The honeycomb is used to destroy the
turbulence produced at the intake, and
10

in the air before it reaches the testing
area.
Complex Tunnel Design
As the design becomes more complex,
more improvements and refinements are
incorporated. By building a wind-
tunnel as a closed circuit in the form
of a rectangle (plan view) the effects
of a "closed-return tunnel" can be had.
Variations in the diameter help to pro-
duce a greater air velocity and smoother
air flow at the testing chamber. In tun-
nels with larger testing areas, the testing
chamber restricting walls are eliminated,
and the airstream jumps across the re-
sulting space. These are usually used
when testing propellers and motors to
avoid having the exhaust gasses circu-
late, but full-scale planes are also tested
here. The reduction of the diameter is
not so great in the type of tunnel which
receives the larger objects for testing.
Testing areas with diameters as great
as 20 feet may be achieved.
A variation of the single return tun-
nel is the combination of two tunnels to
form the double-return tunnel. With
their airstreams combining just before
the model is reached, a testing area cross
section of 30 x 60 feet is obtained. In
the return type of tunnel, once the air
has reached its maximum speed, the
motors need only overcome the losses
of friction, while in the straight tunnel
the power is always used to get the new-
air moving, with a resulting lower air
speed.
In all return-type tunnels care must
be taken to have a sufficient total length
of duct for the air shadow of the model
to be eliminated before the air circuit
has been completed, and it is common
practice to make a model of the large
tunnel before construction. In the case
of one large tunnel, the model itself
is a working tunnel with a testing area
5 feet in diameter and a maximum
speed of 200 mph. This smaller tunnel
is available for preliminary experiments
in technique for the larger tunnel.
Wind-Tunnel Fans and Model
Suspensions
As the new tunnels increased in size
and more scientific knowledge was
gained, the tunnel fans were improved
so that now controllable-pitch fans,

blades feathered for high-pressure oper-
ation, when the air is dense and rela-
tively few working blades are required.
The suspension system consists of two
fundamental elements having as their
two objectives the supporting of the
model and the measuring of the model
forces and moments. The first of these
is the model suspension system proper
and the second is known as the metrical
system.
The system most commonly associ-
ated with wind-tunnels is the three-
point system. In this, a scale model of
the complete airplane is supported by
means of two vertical model support
arms attached to points on the wings,
and a third strut which is attached near
the tail of the model. These three struts
are supported from the metrical system.
Thus, any forces or moments applied
to the model by the air stream are trans-
mitted to the force-measuring system.
In order that the air forces on the
trunnion arms and the tail strut may be
held to a minimum, all three units have
windshields covering a large proportion
of their length. This is essential since
the support arms are a part of the force-
measuring system, while the windshields
are fastened to the tunnel shell.
The metrical, or load-and-moment-
measuring system, is unique in several
ways. First, it is entirely contained in
the structural shell of the tunnel and
therefore must operate at pressures both
above and below atmospheric pressure.
Secondly, no forces or moments arising
from the air loads on the model are con-
nected to the force-and-moment-meas-
uring devices through ball or other nor-
mal types of bearings, and thus there is
no bearing friction entering the final
data. Third, all forces and moments
are separated so that the six compo-
nents, (lift, drag, cross-wind force,
pitching moment, rolling moment, and
yawing moment) are made available in
the form of direct-reading data, with-
out the necessity of additional computa-
tions.
The forces and moments that act on
the airplane, and the model in the wind-
tunnel, depend upon its height with
respect to the direction of the air
stream; that is. they depend upon its
angle of attack and angle of yaw. The
variations of the forces and moments
with these angles is very important to
the airplane designer. For this reason,
it is necessary that the model-support-
ing mechanism, which is attached to the
balances, be capable of carrying the
angles of attack and of yaw of the
model in the wind tunnel. In fact, a
typical wind-tunnel test consists of
varying either the angle of attack or
angle of yaw, while holding the other
angle at a fixed value, and recording the

The important fields of law and engi-
neering have been successfully combined
in the career of Arthur W. Dew. who
received his bachelor's degree in naval
architecture and marine engineering
from the University of Michigan's Col-
lege of Engineering in 1920. Currently,
as attorney advisor in the Office of the
Chief of Ordnance, his duties include
royalty adjustment, settlement of patent
infringement claims against the Bureau
of Ordnance, and preparation and prose-
cution of patent application claims for
fire-rontrol svstems.
After his graduation he was employed
by Bishop and Company as assistant
operating engineer and with Consumers
Power Company as draftsman, until
1922, when he was engaged in examina-
tion of patents for gun fire control,
bombsights, gyroscopic and magnetic
compasses and gyroscopic aircraft in-
struments. During 1944 and 1945 he
was occupied with the firm of Toulmin
and Toulmin as head of their Richmond,
Virginia, patent law office.
When the government's Bureau of
Ordnance returned to Washington in
1945, Mr. Dew reentered government
service at his present position.

Radio Club
During the fall of 1946. after a
period of war-enforced inactivity, the
University of Michigan Radio Club be-
gan reorganization. At first, interest
seemed to lag. but With the beginning
of the Spring semester a period of great
activity began. Under the able director-
ship of President Frank Arams, the
club began to expand. In the Fall
semester, the meetings had been held in
one of the smaller rooms of the West
Engineering Building, but greatly in-
creased Spring semester attendance
forced the club to move to a larger
room. 229 West Engineering.
With the guidance of Mr. J. F. Cline
of the Electrical Engineering depart-
ment, an amateur radio station was
established in the engineering Annex.
While there is still work to be done on
this project, the club hopes to have
station W8ZUP on the air soon.
Equipped with two transmitters, the
station will offer communications facili-
ties on every amateur band down to ten
meters. Interest has been expressed at
meetings in the two-and-a-half-meter
band, and the club will probably have
a two-and-a-half-meter transmitter on
the air shortly.
Because a number of members of the
club do not have amateur radio oper-
ator's licenses, classes in theory, code,
and the legal aspects of amateur radio
have been organized to prepare the
prospective licensees for the Federal
Communications Commission license
examination.
At the meetings of the club every
other Thursday, a feature of the pro-
gram is a talk by some person as-
sociated with radio. These talks are con-
cerned with any side of radio from the
legal to the technical, and efforts are
made to keep them of interest to all. So
far this year, the club has heard talks
on transmission lines and on radar coun-
ter-measures, both of which were en-
thusiastically received.
As development continues, the club

expects to be able to make a large and
varied list of activities available to its
members. Besides the communications
facilities and radio classes, the club
workbench will provide space for those
interested in building new equipment,
both for themselves and for the club,
and for those who wish to experiment.

The American Institute of Chemical
Engineers planned an outstanding pro-
gram to climax a successful semester of
chapter activities. The second in the
series of events planned by the Engi-
neering Council for the entire Engineer-
ing College was given Thursday Eve-
ning, May IS, in Kellogg Auditorium of
the Dental Building under the joint
sponsorship of the University Chapter
of the American Institute of Chemical
Engineers and the Society of Women
Engineers.
At that time Professor A. B. New-
man, Vice President of the American
Institute of Chemical Engineers and
Dean of the Institute of Technology,
College of the City of New York, dis-
cussed reconstruction of German in-
dustry. Professor Newman was Head
of the Industrial Branch, Office of Mili-
tary Government in the American Zone,
and was stationed in Berlin. Professor
Newman's son, Phillip, is a graduate
student in Chemical Engineering here
at the University.
Election of next year's officers was
held at the meeting on May 15th. The
Annual AIChE Chapter Award was pre-
sented to the Junior having the highest
scholastic standing during his Freshman
and sophomore years. Awards of a
year's subscription to Chemical Engi-
neering Progress, the official publication
of AIChE were given to the two mem-
bers of the Chapter whose solutions to
the National AIChE Contest Problem
were sent from this University to the
National Competition.
The award of the local AIChE quiz
prize was made also at this last meeting.
The last official activity of the chap-
ter was a plant trip to the Graselli Sul-
furic Acid Plant at Ecorse and the
Goebel Brewing Co. in Detroit. Re-
freshments and a good time occupied all
engineers participating.

WHAT IS SOCIETY?
GEORGE R. CROSSMAN '48E
The other day I walked innocently
into lecture a little early only to dis-
cover my old friend, Midge, hiding be-
hind a copy of the Technic with a very
deep frown on his face. Wondering what
there could be in the Technic to pro-
voke such displeasure, I asked him what
the trouble was and, true to his voluble
nature, I received a long and detailed
reply. It seemed that he was seriously
concerned about something I had writ-
ten concerning the relationship of the
engineer to society. "Sure," he said, "I
agree that engineers ought to be con-
cerned with the problems of our mod-
ern society. After all, we're all members
of society and are affected by it. But
what bothers me," and here the frown
deepened to puzzlement, is simply this;
What is society? How can I know what
to do about all these problems if I don't
understand what sort of a society I live
in? You speak glibly about society but
you don't define your terms."
That set me to thinking. For Midge
is not one to be easily concerned with
such remote things as freedom and so-
cial democracy. Or are they so remote?
Are they abstract ideals? Or are they,
in reality, an integral part of our very
life as long as we are a part of a demo-
cratic society? Succumbing to my cur-
iosity, I went off to the library to see
what some of the prominent writers of
today had to say and here is what I
found. I haven't seen Midge yet but
I'm anxious to see if perhaps he can
find some of the answers to his ques-
tions here.
One of the first books I found was
Marshall Field's Freedom Is More Than
a Word.1 Mr. Field, the inheritor of the
Field millions and owner of two large
newspapers, the Chicago Sun and PM,
has herein attempted to set forth his
own personal philosophy regarding free-
dom and what it means. Starting with
a description of the implications of free-
dom and a free state socially and politi-
cally, he proceeds to a discussion of the
necessary requirements of freedom, on
both a general and a personal level.
"The Disinherited" is the title of a
chapter dealing with the significance of
minorities and the threat of suppression
and prejudice to freedom and democ-
racy. 'How close are we to freedom in
America?' is the question he asks in ef-
fect, and as an illustration he depicts
in some detail the story of the founding
of his two newspapers and the battle
that was necessary to establish a free
organ of publication in a field already
tightly controlled. He ends on the theme
of progress and chooses as the title to
his last section "Faith in Human Pos-
sibilities." There seem to be no attempts
made to modify the ideals he stands for
and, although he would seem to be too
much in favor of fighting force with
force, his arguments are clear and pene-
trating.
A second book in which I found some
of the answers to my friend's searching
questions was Aldous Huxley's Science,
Liberty, and Peace." The question here
is an expansion of Tolstoi's statement to
the effect that a system giving control
of the masses to the few only increases
suppression with each victory of man
over nature. Thus Mr. Huxley, author
of such works as Brave New World,
and Point-Counter-Point, comes forth to
say that science is playing an unavoid-
able role in the shaping of our society
and the directing of its progress. He
describes in some detail the way in
which our society makes use of the
powers science has made available and
explores the fields of politics, propagan-
da, interested groups' coercion of the
masses, and unemployment, and chal-
lenges America to overcome these evils.
'We fail to learn from our experiences'
is his theme, and his solution is the
turning of science and scientists to a
greater interest in people. Scientists,
says Mr. Huxley, should pledge the "use
(of) knowledge for the good of human-
ity."
Pursuing this idea still further
through the periodical room, I dis-
covered two articles that serve as brief
glimpses into other aspects of the same
problem. The first of these, entitled
"The Social Composition of Scientific
Power";! and written by Isaiah Bow-
man, President of John Hopkins Univer-
sity, takes the theme that "engineering
is nothing apart from human benefit."
Dr. Bowman asks the question "What is
Culture?" very directly and develops
his answer along the line that culture
is discovered and understood only by
a comparison with previous cultures.
Using peace as his watchword, he calls
upon science to answer the cry of hu-
manity for freedom and peace in the
world. Only through knowledge and
understanding shall we achieve the way
of life we ideally want, says Dr. Bow-
man, and science, being a branch of
knowledge, and holding the key to
world power now, must become serious-
ly interested in society if we are to
achieve these ideals.
The second article, entitled "Science
and Democracy,'' an editorial for the
New Republic, takes this theme of the
interdependence and interrelationship of
science and society even further. The
article criticizes the use that has been
made of science in our society by stat-
ing that, up till now, science has been
used only "to speed up the production
of things." America, says the author,
has the necessary facilities to obtain the
economy of abundance that we have
hoped for so long. Our natural re-
sources and educational opportunities
are ample for the achievement of the
high standard of living we all want. Yet
we have not attained this high standard.
Why has this goal, which seems so eas-
ily within our grasp, remained appar-
ently unapproachable? The answer
given in this article is that we have
neglected to take advantage of the full
opportunities offered by science for the
raising of our cultural and economic
level. We must, if we are ever to achieve
this goal, integrate the workings of the
field of science with the workings of so-
ciety. Only when science and society are
both equally aware of their mutual
needs and mutual interdependence will
we succeed in this endeavor.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC




Rigid Inspection
is the rule
Bell Telephone equipment, being precision
apparatus, must stand inspection during
each stage of its manufacture. Materials
being used in manufacture . . . parts in
process... partial assemblies...equipment
after it is assembled and wired ... all must
be checked and rechecked to insure high
quality of performance.
The design and maintenance of test
equipment for such a wide variety of
products calls for men with technical train-
ing and inventive resourcetulness.
This equipment must be fast and ac-
curate in operation, and although it may
be complex in design and construction, it
must be simple to operate by the average
worker. And. to facilitate mass production,
test equipment of many different types
is also required.
Here are just a few interesting examples
of the many test sets Western Electric en-
gineers have developed to meet these needs.
for Engineers

What's wrong with
which wire?
Formerly, when switchboard cables failed
to pass inspection, it was often difficult to
determine which conductor was causing
the trouble and what the exact nature ol
the trouble was. Not any more. Now,
Western Electric engineers have devel-
oped a new test set that checks switch-
board cables for the continuity of each
wire... that checks the dielectric strength
between each wire and every other wire
and the ground shield. It automatically
tests a cable of up to 320 conductors for
continuity and insulation resistance in a
total testing time of 35 seconds! If a de-
fect is present, the faulty conductor and
the type of defect is indicated visually.

Looking at voices
A new method for testing the volume
efficiency of telephone receivers has been
introduced since the end of the war. Now,
the output of a OoOOO cycle per second,
slow sweep band frequency oscillator is
applied to the receiver and its output de-
picted upon a long persistence screen ot
an oscilloscope. Thus, an inspector can
see the complete frequency response curve
of the receiver under test and quickly
classify defective receivers according to
the nature ot the defect.

Find the pinhole!
In the manufacture of coils for relays,
ringers, etc., Western Electric uses tre-
mendous amounts of enameled wire. The
quality of this insulating enamel must be
of the highest. So Western Electric devel-
oped a "pinhole" test set which reliably
detects the most minute imperfections in
the enamel coating as soon as it comes
from the baking oven. This instrument
helps greatly in maintaining quality
standards and in establishing satisfactory
sources of supply.

Is it cracked on
the inside?
In wartime especially, a large volume of
non-ferrous rod stock was used. Testing
it for internal flaws became imperative,
yet no manufacturer of such stock had
devised any method. Western Electric en-
gineers came through with a device to do
the job. One that not only located objec-
tionable cracks and determined their
thickness but also served as a precise
thickness gauge for such materials as
aluminum condenser foil . . . detecting
differences of a fraction of a millionth of
an inch in foil nominally two hundred
millionths of an inch thick.
Manufacturing telephone and radio apparatus for the Hell System is Western Electric's primary job. It calls
for engineers of many kinds — electrical, mechanical, industrial, chemical, metallurgical — who devise
and improve machines and processes for large scale production of highest quality communications equipment.

Seldom do we find on campus a more
well-rounded student than Bill Pritula.
Throughout his college career Bill has
personified the qualities which make for
a successful engineering student. He
has acquired talents which reach into
practically every phase of college activ-
ity and which have made him stand out
in all of his academic and athletic en-
deavors.
Born in Pittsburgh in 1922, Bill's
family later moved to Detroit, which
was to be the scene of his high school
years. Bill played a very active role
while at Chadsey high school, distin-
guishing himself both scholastically and
athletically. He played football there,
and was on the baseball and swimming
teams, besides.
In 1941, registered in the Dean's of-
fice under Chemical Engineering was
the name William Pritula. Having
chosen his profession, Bill embarked on
what was to be a star-studded career
here at Michigan.
His hands filled with a complete engi-
neering schedule. Bill managed to join
Coach Crisler's classes down at Ferry
Field each afternoon during the football
season. By 1942, Bill was playing in
the tackle position for the Michigan
varsity. That season he averaged 57
minutes of play for each game on the
Michigan schedule. On three Saturday
afternoons he went the route with 60
minutes of action.
However, the Army had another po-
sition for him to fill about June 1943.
Bill was able fto continue his educa-
tion for a short while at Rose Polytech-
nic under the ASTP program; but soon,
after infantry training at Texas, he
found himself with an Engineer con-
struction battallion in the Pacific.
After a long absence from the college
atmosphere, Bill got back to the Michi-
gan campus last year and started in
again where he left off. He earned his
third letter award in football this past
season, and his scholastic abilities were
recognized when he was initiated into
Tau Beta Pi. He is also a member of
Vulcans and Kappa Sigma fraternity.
Bill has worked for several summers
with the U. S. Rubber Co.. using his
background in chemical engineering,
and he has gained considerable experi-
ence in that organization's testing lab-
oratories.

William Pritula
He plans to graduate in January,
1948. Today. 412 University Terrace is
the scene of Bill's homelife, where he
lives with his wife, Irene, and their new
baby girl.
His accomplishments here at college
augur him success in whatever he under-
takes. So well has he demonstrated his
abilities and distinguished himself that
the old Alma Mater is proud to have
Bill Pritula as one of her favorite sons.
prof, gordy
Charles Burton Gordy. Professor of
Industrial Engineering in the Mechan-
ical Engineering Department is, to quote
his own words at the outset of our in-
terview, "a man with a poor sense of
humor." One would little suspect that
a man with a 'poor sense of humor' is
so deeply interested in a phase of stu-
dent activity which requires a capacity
for understanding human nature and
behavior—for delving into reasons for
low scholastic achievement.
We suspected it least of all. and so
we proceeded to interrogate Prof. Gordy
with some trepidation, wondering if we
should smile while we spoke to him. We
did—and uncovered the following:
He was born in Salisbury. Md.. in
1898. and grew up on the farm along a
railroad track. At this point he must
have been carried away in his thoughts,
because he jokingly appended ". . . the
wrong side of the tracks." We were en-
couraged to inquire about his high
school life in the nearby city. Here
young Gordy ("a country hick to my
metropolis-bred classmates of Wicomico
County") participated in football and
track, was manager of the athletic as-
sociation, and was vice-president of his
class.
Prof. Gordy was now reminiscing on
all cylinders, and he recalled that at
that time he couldn't compute the
cubical content of a cubical tank. We
chuckled with him. and then he related
how it came about that he and the
principal came to see eye to eye. It
seemed that Master Gordy was throw-
ing snowballs from the high school
tower, to which the sole means of en-
trance and egress was a ladder leading
from the principal's office. Yes, Master
Gordy wanted to quit the tower, but
there was the principal who had returned
and had removed the ladder. Professor
Gordy recalled that he and the principal
stared at each other (down and up. re-
spectively) in complete silence for close
to a minute. That was the professor,
graduate of Wicomico High School.
1913. 'Why Comico. . . .?' Perhaps here
was begun the questioning of what was
funny and what was not.
Professor Gordy received his Ph.D.
(Economics) in 1929 here at the Uni-
versity of Michigan, after receiving his
B.S. and A.M. from the University of
Pennsylvania. Besides his teaching du-
ties here. Professor Gordy is a consult-
ing editor of "Factory Management and
Maintenance." a leading technical en-
gineering publication: he is chairman of
the Committee on Scholastic Standing:
and a member of the Executive Com-
mittee of the Institute for Human Ad-
justment.
It was readily apparent to us that
Professor Gordy was intensely inter-
ested in the functions of these com-
mittees. The latter committee, through
one of its subdivisions (The Bureau of
Psychological Services) helps guide the
individual by means of psychological
testing. As a member of the two com-
mittees mentioned. Prof. Gordy is in
an excellent position to review a case
and to follow it up in its remedial stages.

bread and steel
The age of steel has transformed
agricultural methods in marked and
visible steps, particularly in the wheat
fields. Known to all are the accomplish-
ments of plows, harrows, tractors, com-
bines, motor trucks, railroad cars, and
grain elevators. With respect to these
mechanisms, the effect of steel as a fac-
tor in production of bread is obvious.
But many more tons of steel do the
bidding of workmen in a hundred ob-
scure ways, transforming the raw ma-
terial wheat into edible bread. From
the elevator the wheat proceeds by truck
or rail to giant flour mills where auto-
matic machines "dry clean" each grain,
discarding weed seeds, trash, and sand.
Then steel rollers begin the conversion
into flour. Strong air currents in the
'"middlings purifier" blast away the last
remaining particles of bran and lint
from the endosperm. Giant vibrating
"bolters" sift the Hour through a series
of fine-silk screens and the product
eventually finds its way to one of a
number of canvas spouts from which are
obtained numerous kinds of flour and
other products.
A particle of the finest 'patent-flour"
will have gone through as many as 180
separations in a series of operations re-
quiring less than an hour. About
seventy-two per cent of the wheat berry
is consumed in making this fine, white
flour. Needing only the addition of extra
vitamins to make it ready for use, steel
rollers, steel chutes, steel bins, and steel
elevating and weighing machinery serve
to make flour production a "hands-off"
process.
Back in the steel trucks and railroad
cars, the processed flour is delivered to
homes, stores, and bakeries. The latter
are again scrupulously clean, efficient,
and almost completely mechanized.
Automatic steel blending bins mix vari-
ous kinds and grades of flour to the
proper consistency. Continuing the
pushbutton process, steel elevators and

conveyors pass the blends on to sifters
and thence to storage bins.
When a "batch" is needed, more con-
veyors carry the flour to automatic
weighing hoppers which control dis-
charge into giant steel mixers. Although
water addition is controlled by auto-
matic meters, the human hand enters
the picture for the first time in the ad-
dition of shortening, sugar or honey,
milk solids, salt, yeast, and vitamins.
Three quarters of a ton of dough are
mixed at one time and then poured into
movable rising troughs. Under close
control of temperature and humidity
the bread is allowed to "rise." an effect
of the same yeast which proved its use-
fulness many years ago in the family
baking procedure.
The raised bread is machine-divided
into accurately sized lumps, dusted with
flour, and rolled into neat balls by an-
other machine, the "rounder." Continu-
ing the mechanical processing, the
''proofer" accelerates the raising process,
kneads the dough, and delivers it to the
''moulder." Here it is shaped to pan-
size and transferred by hand to indi-
vidual steel pans.
Oil- or gas-fired ovens ten feet high
and up to 130 feet in length handle a
continuous production line, discharging
evenly-baked loaves of bread. After
cooling, the loaves are fed into a battery
of band saws for slicing and are then
machine wrapped, sealed, and delivered
via conveyor belts to delivery trucks.
aerial surveys
It is said that when man took to the
air. he was stepping into an age of
achievement which would know no
bounds; that everyone and everything
would in some way. directly or indirect-
ly, be affected by his ventures in the
sky. As we look around us today, this
assertion seems to be very true.
Oddly enough, one effect of the air
age has been its influence on ground
transportation. Although appearing
rather insignificant, the contribution of
aerial photography to vehicular trans-
portation is one example of the impor-
tant role aviation is playing in the
modern world.
Although a state highway office may
have excellent topographical maps of
its territory, large-scale up-to.-date aerial
photographs are of tremendous value.
First, they aid in securing the optimum
route for a road; and. second, engineer-
ing costs are cut down.
Existing topographical maps do not
indicate land use. nor do they supply

ings. By contrast, the aerial photograph
gives a complete bird's eye view of all
surface features.
This enables the engineer to deter-
mine, at a glance, to what use the land
has been put: whether the built-up sec-
tions are residential or industrial. Also
clearly noticeable are the locations of
schools, cemeteries, and big tracts of
land, such as golf courses.
Often, types of soil can be determined
from the pictures, and areas presenting
design difficulties can be avoided. These
pictures are of assistance in construc-
tion, since the location of construction
material, such as gravel, can be fre-
quently determined right on the map
without going into the field. The prints
also help determine geological character-
istics and the varied natural features of
the area through which a route will
pass.
A layman can more readily under-
stand an aerial photo then he can a
straight topographic map. This fact is
important for it enables him to reach a
fair decision in property condemnation
procedings.
Costs are of utmost importance to
any organization. The state highway
commissioner is constantly aware of
this fact when, for instance, the con-
struction of one mile of road costs hun-
dreds of dollars. If he can slash costs
he will. The aerial photograph has be-
come a valuable asset in this regard. By
the use of these maps, preliminary plan-
ning and route selection have become
primarily an office project, and the
layout and study of alternate routes is
a matter of hours instead of days. This
eliminates many costly inspections.
When based on aerial photos, prelimi-
nary planning also becomes more ac-
curate. Future cost estimates and ac-
curate engineering data can be compiled
before the actual construction of the
road gets under way.
The state highway department of
Connecticut has used aerial photos to
great advantage. The topography of
this small densely populated state pre-
sents a moderately difficult terrain prob-
lem. However, this condition is ag-
gravated by the density of the verdure
lining the state's heavily traveled and
secondary highways. In the industrial
and residential areas of that state the
works of man closely line the major
roads and extend for considerable dis-
tances to either side. As traffic on these
main roads increased, new road loca-
tions had to be found and new roads
built. This meant extensive investiga-
tion of the topography and the works of
man over wide areas. Ordinary "strip
surveys," depicting cultural data and
topography along the margins of the
highway, were not adequate as an over-
all picture of conditions influencing re-
location. Here, the aerial survey was of
immeasurable value and facilitated the
location of new roads.
on the part of engine-room personnel.
In the United States certain ships are
electrically steered. The electrical steer-
ing is accomplished by the extensive use
of relays and contactor circuits and the
control of the steering motor is essen-
tially the same as that employed in ele-
vator drive circuits. Large panel boards
are used for mounting the numerous
relays, solenoid switches, and the accel-

As the demand increases, aerial pho-
tography will experience a reduction in
price. Today the cost is between $600
and $800 per mile for mosaics 5000 feet
wide, and $1500 per mile for topograph-
ical maps 1500 feet wide, at a scale of
1 inch equals 100 feet and a contour
interval of two feet.
electrical steering
of ships
Prior to World War II the use of
electrical mechanisms for the steering
of ships was unheard of in the United
States. However, during the war emer-
gency many ships were equipped with
electrical steering devices to provide
sensitive control and afford safer navi-
gation.
In the past, the steam-engine drive
and the electrohydraulic steering gear
have been used extensively for the steer-
ing of ships. Both of these systems are
essentially mechanical in nature, simple
in construction, and require a minimum
of maintenance and electrical knowledge
eration and speed control circuits. Since
this system requires a considerable num-
ber of relays, which would require per-
fect adjustment, its use has been some-
what limited. The development of the
AEG Ward Leonard System in Europe
has been proven successful in the elec-
trical steering of ships. This system
requires relatively few and simple
electrical circuits, yet it is rugged and
requires a minimum of maintenance.
The Ward Leonard power system for
steering of ships is essentially a three
unit motor-generator set. The motor
of the power system is of the compound-
wound type, operates from the ship's
current (230 volts d.c), and is usually
rated between 35 and 50 horsepower.
The motor drives the directly-connected
compound-wound generator which is
connected electrically without any inter-
fering circuits to the armature terminals
of the steering motor. This generator
is rated at 25 to 35 kilowatts. The third

But. you say, '"What is this "Index of

ing to coach us in the fine art of getting

prepared by the ASME covering the

more money." Well, at first glance you
would probably think that I am depart-
ing from logic befitting to an engineer
and resorting to either sheer mysticism
or Sunday school stuff. However, no-
where does the correctness of the mental
attitude have any more bearing on re-
sults than does your mental attitude
with respect to how much work you
give in return for your salary. Let me
explain in detail what I mean by an
"Index of Giving."
Shortly after I graduated from en-
number of years out of college. It had
a number of lines which represented the
earnings of both those graduates who
stayed in engineering and those grad-
uates who gradually switched into non-
engineering work. I immediately cut
one of these charts out of Mechanical
Engineering and decided that I would
plot my earnings for a few years and
see how they lined up with earnings of
52.000 other engineering graduates.
At first. I looked upon the gradually
upward sloping line as an index of my
earning power. As I made a more com-
plete and extensive study of earnings, I
realized that what I was actually plot-
ting was my ability to give more than I
was worth, an index of my ability to
give, rather than an index of my ability
to get. That chart, started more than
fifteen years ago, has been reviewed and
expanded on twelve different occasions
during the past fifteen years. Outlines
of the chart are shown in the accom-
panying diagram.
One of the most important functions
of the chart is to portray the lack of
advancement. If, at the end of two suc-
cessive years, there has been no upward
slope in the line of giving, then obvious-
ly one of two things is wrong.
Either,
1. There is something fundamentally
wrong with the general situation, such
as having gotten sidetracked under a
boss who does not welcome your ad-
vancement, or having been sidetracked
into a job which just does not have any
chance for you to show your greater
worth, or
2. You have failed to improve your-
self mentally to a point where you are
worth any more than you are currently
being paid.
Regardless of which one of these
things you decide best represents the
case, you personally are in a position to
do something about it. You either quit
and look for another job where condi-
tions are more favorable, or you take
yourself in hand and make certain that
you embark upon a self-improvement
program designed to make yourself
worth more.
And now we are in a position to un-
derstand my use of the word "if" in
the opening paragraphs. "You can set
almost any salary goal you want, and
get it, if you only realize that there is
plenty of room at the top and continu-
ously over the years use some device
such as the "Index of Giving" to make
sure that you are always worth more
than you are bring paid." Actually, it
is as simple as A.B.C, and more than
anything else, the question. "What
salary will you earn?" will be answered
by the diligence with which you try to
continuously make yourself worth more
than you are being paid.

The general purpose of all wind tun-
nel tests is to obtain data from which
the airplane designer can develop the
design of a new plane. Because of the
extreme complexity of modern aircraft.
a great many different varieties of data
are required before it is possible to
lay out a good, balanced design. In
most instances, it is impossible, or at
least very uneconomical, to obtain accu-
rate design information from airplanes
in flight, and it is highly desirable to
obtain data from other methods than
flight testing. Wind-tunnels have been
developed for this reason.
Certain types of investigations which
may be carried out in a wind-tunnel are
of more theoretical interest than of im-
mediate applicability in the design of
aircraft, and really belong to the field
of fluid mechanics. Apart from investi-
gations of this sort, wind tunnel tests

data without having in mind a specific
airplane, or they may be conducted on
a scale model of a proposed airplane
with a view to predicting the perform-
ance and flying qualities of the full-
scale airplane. Tests of the first class
usually involve systematic changes in
the model configuration and routine
measurements of the forces and mo-
ments acting on the model. The model
might, for example, represent a hori-
zontal tail surface consisting of the
stabilizer and movable elevator.
Tunnels may also be operated under
reduced pressures, down to one-tenth
of atmospheric pressure. An advantage
of this arrangement is that at low pres-
sures, less power is required to produce
a high-speed airstream than is required
at atmospheric or higher pressures.
Reynolds' Number
In experiments with flowing fluids,
it has been discovered that fluids may
flow in the usual bubbling, boiling,
"turbulent" fashion, but that under
proper conditions they will also flow
along perfect streamlines, in the so-
called "laminar" flow pattern. It has
been found that the factors which deter-
mine which type of flow will occur are
these: the velocity of flow, with higher
velocities producing more turbulence:
the linear size of the body, with smaller
bodies conducive to laminar flow; and
the physical qualities of the flowing
meduim, as measured by density and
viscosity, with greater density and
lower viscosity giving turbulent con-
ditions of flow.
These factors are combined in a single
parameter, called Reynolds' Number
thus:
As the velocity of motion is increased
in a test of fluid flow, a certain velocity
is reached at which turbulent flow may
begin, and below which only laminar
flow can occur. This "critical" velocity
determines the critical Reynolds' Num-
ber, which has been found to be a con-
stant for all fluid flow conditions. Thus
the same conditions of laminar or tur-
bulent flow will be encountered with
the model and with the prototype if the

with each. Since the only variables in
the expression are velocity and linear
size, the velocity required with a small
model may be expected to be consider-
ably larger than that of the actual ship.
Naval Towing Tanks
Model testing procedures are widely
used in evaluating ship designs, particu-
larly in the determination of resistance
values. The frictional resistance of a
ship's hull to forward motion through
the water results in the loss of a large
part of the energy used to propel the
ship. In order to closely estimate the
amount of power required for propul-
sion, fluid resistance values must be ob-
tained, and experimental means are best
for determining such values, for a math-
ematical analysis of fluid flow under the
varying conditions about a ship's hull
is almost impossible.
Just as with aircraft, the expense in-
volved in producing a full-sized unit
merely for tests of optimum shape and
surface finish would be enormous. For
this reason, and also to facilitate instru-
mentation and measurements during
testing, models are built which are
geometrically similar to the "prototype,"
or full-sized vessel. These models can
be towed along the surface of an open
channel, or testing tank, and appro-
priate measurements of the force re-
quired for propulsion can be made.
Speed of Towing
There are many problems which
arise in the planning and execution of
such tests, and the initial question is
probably. "How fast should the model
be towed?" Two answers immediately
appear to be warranted: either the
model should be towed at the speed at
which the prototype will travel, or it
should move at a speed which is the
same fraction of the prototype's speed
that the model's length is of the proto-
type's length.
Both of these possibilities are incor-
rect, however, for we must take into
account the principles of fluid flow
around a body. Although in naval
towing tests the model is towed through
the water, results are the same as if the
liquid were flowing past a stationary
model. Thus the Reynolds' Number
criterion must be applied to our prob-
lem, making it slightly more difficult to
arrive at the correct towing speed.
MODEL TESTING
{Continued from page 23)
A second factor which must be con-
sidered in ship model testing is wave-
making resistance. Since aircraft are
traveling through their medium, while
ships must travel on the surface of
theirs, the wave-making resistance is
an essential consideration in power cal-
culations. To give similar wave-making

characteristics to both the model and
the prototype, it has been found that
the model must travel at a much lower
speed than the ship. Obviously, if a
five-foot model were to travel at the
speed of a five-hundred-foot ship, it
would throw up enormous bow-plumes,
while the ship would be generating
small undulations on the surface of the
water.
These two contradictory factors in
the determination of testing speed ne-
cessitate some sort of compromise, and
the wave-making requirements of the
test have actually been found to be the
determining factor. The previously
mentioned bow-waves would seriously
alter the contact pattern between water
and model hull, and destroy the value
of the resistance values thus determined.
The usual testing procedure utilizes the
low speeds required for favorable wave-
making comparison of model and proto-
type, and propulsion force values from
these tests may be corrected for fric-
tional resistance, by using previously
determined correction factors for speed.
Hull Roughness
In addition to the calculation of re-
sistance values for various shapes of
ship's hulls, the naval towing tank
offers suitable conditions for many other
types of problems in ship-construction.
For instance, the roughness of the hull
surface will considerably affect the
power required to drive a ship. It has
been estimated that fouling growths of
barnaclts and seaweed on a ship's hull
may increase frictional resistance by as
much as 500%. Tests of surface finish
and its effects on speed-power relation-
ships are frequently made in naval
tanks.
Shallow Channels
The performance of a ship in deep
ocean water and its performance when
moving through shallow, narrow chan-
nels are widely different, and the com-
parison has long been of interest to
naval experiments. Professor Louis
A. Baier, in an article for the MICHI-
GAN TECHNIC of November, 1944,
entitled "The University Naval Tank,"
states that tank experimenters were be-
ing made as early as 1763. Says Profes-
sor Baier: "In 1768 our own versatile
Ben Franklin satisfied his curiosity con-
cerning the increase in resistance of
barges operating in shoal water through
the use of tank tests. Small models were
towed the length of a miniature tank by
means of the gravitational pull on a
shilling attached to a line from the bow,
and running over a sheave at the tank
end. By comparing the increase in time
required by the model to traverse the
distance, as the water was successively
shoaled (made shallower), he obtained
reliable estimates of shallow water am-
plification of drag."
To facilitate modern experiments
with shallow water, the University of
Michigan Naval Tank is equipped with
a false bottom over 140 feet of its
length. This bottom may be raised
toward the water surface, giving the
same testing results as are obtained
with full-size ships in shallow harbors
and passages, and in canals and locks.
Naval Tank Problems
The comparative sizes of the model
and its testing basin must be main-
tained throughout all towing tests, or
the above-mentioned shoal-water per-
formance may be found when deep-
water conditions are desired. Professor
Baier. in his paper "Principles of Tow-
ing Tank Research," says that "The
minimum width of the tank is frequent-
ly considered to be 15 times the beam
of the model, and the tank cross-section
as 100 times the model's midship area."
Uniformity of motion of the model
through the water is another essential
condition which must be maintained,
and if an electrically driven towing car

the motors supply-voltage constant, to
avoid any variations in speed.
An unexpected problem which devel-
oped as testing progressed was the con-
dition of the tank water. Not only did
it need to be kept clean and free from
sediment and algae, but it also needed
to be kept in a state of motion. That
is not to say that the tank water should
be flowing, but rather that its tendency
to flow turbulently around the model,
just as ocean water will flow around the
ship, must be maintained. This is some-
times done by throwing the water out
of equilibrium just ahead of the model
by dragging a vertical wire through it,
and this wire may be mounted on the
model itself, although drag adjustments
must be made in this case. The method
of stirring the basin water employed at
the University of Michigan involves
spraying the surface with fine jets of
water on every return trip of the tow-
ing car, thus leaving it in a state highly
conducive to turbulent flow.
Conclusion
The difficulties encountered in the
dynamic testing of model ships are re-
markably similar to those found in
wind-tunnel tests. The condition and
velocity of the medium are perhaps the
most challenging problems in both types

Turbulent flow.
of testing. The velocity of the fluid
which flows past the model must be con-
trollable, but during testing it must be
absolutely constant, for it is the most
important variable factor influencing
resistance to flow. Wind-tunnel turbu-
lence must be eliminated, as far as pos-
sible, while turbulent flow in ship-model
testing is almost necessary in the dupli-
cation of full-scale flow conditions.
In both ship and aircraft-model
testing, the models themselves must
have the smoothest possible surfaces,
for such details as rivet heads are sel-
dom reproduceable on the model's scale.
The fact that the medium flows past
the model in wind-tunnel tests, while
the model is towed through the medium
in towing-tank experiments may make
it slightly difficult for the layman to
recognize the striking similarity between
these parallel lines of research.

We were just about ready to leave
his office when Prof. Gordy began to
chuckle and asked if we cared to hear
his funniest experience. It seems that
a dog was closely following the right,
rear wheel of a car which had slowed
down to make a left hand turn from
East to South University, snapping and
barking excitedly. Prof. Gordy, who
had come from the Arch, stood waiting
for the car to pass. The car made its
turn, but the dog continued its "straight
line trajectory" directly to Prof. Gordy's
feet. Prof. Gordy still can't explain the
behavior pattern of the dog and why it
substituted his leg for the tire. He was
all smiles as he described the dog "going
lickety-split down the street with his
tail between his legs" after the bite.
As a result of his experiences with

students, he offers this valuable bit of
advice: "Develop the habit of putting
first things first."

At the door, we turned and asked,
"Prof. Gordy, why do you think you
have no sense of humor?"
And he replied, "Well. I suppose I
do have a sense of humor, but I don't
go around slapping people on the back
and laughing loudly at jokes. I guess
you might say I don't go in for sense-
less humor."

mechanism and things mechanical is
probably the fact that his father was
foreman of the tool-and-die shop for
a Detroit firm, and he had set up a
small machine-shop in the Morrison
garage. It was then that Howard de-
cided to become a mechanical engineer.
He also decided that the University of
Michigan would be his college upon
hearing a Michigan football broadcast
in the early '30's.
Entering the University of Michigan
in the fall of 1939, Howard made the
Freshman Swimming Team and still
kept his grades high enough to qualify
him for Phi Eta Sigma, the Freshman
Honor Society.
To help his brother Gordon finish
college, Howard dropped out at the end
of his freshman year, and went to work
for the Sharpies Chemical Corporation,
of Wyandotte. There, after a year in
chemical production work, he was trans-
ferred to the Engineering Department.
In 1942, after Gordon Morrison had
graduated from Michigan with a Bache-
lor's Degree in Chemical Engineering,
Howard returned as a sophomore. Dur-

land, for basic and specialized ordnance
training. In November, 1943, was sent
to the University of Vermont for ASTP
work. He says that he "loved Ver-
mont,7' and he learned to ski there. His
first attempt at skiing was on a date
with a lass who was an expert on skis.
Morrison was following her down a
Green Mountain, "To prove that I could
ski just as fast as she could," when he
hit a patch of ice. Moe suffered no
major injuries, but he swore off skiing
for life.
In March, 1944, the ASTP broke up,
and he was assigned to the 26th (Yan-
kee) Division, and then to the 383rd
Ordnance Company, where his most
interesting work involved electrical gun-
directors for heavy anti-aircraft guns.
Howard was discharged at Fort Bliss,
Texas, in February of 1946, and he
returned to Michigan immediately to
enroll for the spring term.
He has worked as a student assistant
for Professor Kessler, in Mechanical
Engineering, and is now working for
Professor Dodge, of the Engineering
Mechanics Department.
Howard is a member of Tau Beta Pi.
Phi Kappa Phi, and the student branch
of the American Society of Mechanical
Engineers.
After graduation this August, he
plans to work for a Master's Degree in
Engineering Mechanics.

problem is to work out a tool which permits the undercutting to be
done without removing the armatures from the motors.
THE SIMPLE ANSWER—An S.S.White power drive flexible shaft
hooked up to an electric motor gives you the basis of a portable
power unit for driving small rotary saws. A handpiece designed for
mounting the saws finishes the tool.
The time and labor-saving advantages of having an easily manipu-

unit is the pilot-exciter which supplies
the field current to the generator which
in turn controls the variable and re-
versible generator voltage.
The pilot-exciter is a separately ex-
cited d.c. generator rated at 0.5 to 1.0
kilowatts. The armature is connected
directly to the generator. Two exciting
circuits, differentially wound, comprise
the field winding of the pilot exciter.
When the field windings have balanced
currents, the net magnetic excitation
becomes zero, no exciting current is sup-
plied to the main field of the generator
circuit, and as a result no power is de-
livered to the rudder drive motor. This
change of current in the differentially-
wound field of the pilot exciter is pro-
duced manually by the operation of the
ship's steering wheel.
The main and series fields of the
drive motor are energized whenever the
motor-generator set operates. The main
field has constant excitation from the
ship's power supply, (230 volts d.c.)
while the current in the series field
varies with the load on the main motor.
(Continued from page 21)
Thus, the steering motor becomes sen-
sitive to the smallest armature current,
and will begin to operate as soon as the
current in the armature has developed
sufficient torque to overcome the fric-
tion of the rudder mechanism.
The pilot exciter is very sensitive to
slight movements of the ships' steering
wheel. Extreme sensitivity in the pilot
exciter is obtained by: 1. differentially
winding the field coils on a magnetic
substance; 2. creating a large variation
in exciter field currents through a small
movement of the ship's wheel; and
3. designing the magnetic circuit of the
exciter to respond to small changes in
exciting currents. Thus, slight varia-
tions of current in the field circuits of
the exciter increase both the excitation
supplied to the main generator and the
starting torque in the rudder control
motor. The direction in which the rud-
der control motor rotates depends upon
the values of current in the differential
field windings.
Many of the present-day vessels
(naval and merchant ships) employing
electrical control are equipped with dual
steering systems. The use of dual con-
trols affords an increased degree of
reliability as well as a desirable safety
factor in recognition of the importance
of reliable steering control. In installa-
tions where dual controls are employed,
two complete motor-generator sets, each
with its individual control system, are
utilized. Each motor-generator set is a
complete unit in itself and operates in-
dependently of the other.

Each car has its own power plant, a
compact diesel generator unit, which
furnishes the power for lights, air con-
ditioning and refrigeration. In case of
failure of a unit the next car's genera-
tor unit is connected in. These cars can
be uncoupled and still retain use of all
their facilities.
The power unit for the train is a

rections seats 24 people. The lower
section directly below the Astral Dome
seats 20 passengers and the front and
rear sections at standard floor level

gage compartments eliminating baggage-
strewn aisles and racks, and two lava-
tories complete and well-finished. Each
seat is reversible and adjustable with
nine reclining positions.
Instead of "Lower 12, car 316." the

a private room with his own lavatory
facilities. Doubles and triples are also
available in larger compartments and
drawing rooms. The lower berths are
turned into sofas during the day while
the upper berths fold into the ceiling.
In addition, the new sleepers have an
Astral Dome with reserved seats for
each passenger.
The dining room on the train of to-
morrow departs from convention in
having table service on three levels,
one being the Astral Dome. The tables
are set diagonally, allowing more aisle
room and easier seating. Under the
Astral Dome is a private reserved dining
room. The latest in compact kitchen
and refrigeration equipment is fur-
nished.
The Lounge car has four levels, seat-
ing 68 people, with more than half of
the chairs movable to allow for groups
to gather. The Astral Dome may be
fitted with chairs of the chaise lounge
type for trans-continental trips. The
rear cockpit is nearly all glass with
drapes concealing the few columns,
giving an effect of glass encirclement.

Remedy for red ink rash'
Say "Ah-h-h," Mr. Executive.
A rash of red ink, hm? Production
costs steadily climbing, you say?
Well, there's an effective medication
for your troubles—one that will help
you cut down those excessive expenses
in a hurry.
The prescription? It's called Carboloy
Cemented Carbide—the hardest metal
mnde by man. Formed from the powder
you see pictured into blanks for tools,
dies and wear-resisting parts, Carboloy *
is the greatest single factor for reducing
manufacturing costs that modern
industry has ever known, BECAUSE:
(*for executive use only)
1. Carboloy commonly triples mo output
of both men and machines,
2. Regularly increases the quality of
products, and
3. Cuts, forms or draws the toughest,
most abrasive modern alloys with ac-
curacy and speed previously unknown.
That is why Carboloy is held by
authorities to be one of the ten most
important industrial developments of
the past decade.
We Make This Challenge
The odds are 10 to 1 that Carboloy—
the amazing metal of many uses—can
be put to work by our engineers to give
your products higher quality at lower
cost. Call us in for consultation.

Pneumatic door openers, which operate
on finger touch, are provided on all
doors.
If and when these cars become
standard equipment a train ride will be
a pleasure, the advantages of a regular

rocket gas measurements
Scientists have recently adapted
modifications of methods of measuring
the blazing heat of distant stars and
the speed of rotation of the sun to the
measurement of the heat and velocity of
gases flaring from rockets.
THE TECHNIC EXPLORES
(Continued from page 31)
By study of the wavelengths of mo-
lecular radiation, physicists "take the
temperature" of rocket gases too hot to
measure by conventional methods. The
light of the rocket flame is transformed
into a spectrum by means of lenses and
prisms. One portion of the spectrum is
emitted by hydro-carbon molecules. The
energy released by the molecules is re-
corded on a special photographic plate,
which, after development, is scanned by
by an intricate photo-electric device
known as a micro-densitometer, which
records its findings in the form of a
graph. Correct interpretation of the
graph gives the temperature of the
rocket exhaust, which, in rockets like
the V-2, is approximately 3500 degrees
Fahrenheit.
Using a method by which astronomers
measure the speed of rotation of the sun,
scientists can compare the velocity of
the superheated rocket gases with the
velocity of light. This speed is generally
greater than 6000 feet per second, or
six times the speed of sound. The "Dop-
pler effect" is the basis of the tests. A
common example of the Doppler effect
is the whistle of a moving train, which
seems higher pitched when approach-
ing than when moving away. By means
of two periscopes, looking at an angle
into the rocket jet, the wavelength of
the radiation from sodium atoms in the
flame is recorded on photographic film.
The apparent wavelength of atoms
moving away from the film is recorded
through one periscope and the ap-
parent wavelength of atoms approach-
ing through the other. Comparison with
radiation from a stationary source pro-
vides measurement of the speed of the
atoms and consequently the speed of the
blast.
Doctor Francis P. Bundy, research
physicist with the General Electric
Research Laboratories, states that the
variation in wavelength is so small that
a spectroscope, normally used in wave-
length measurement, cannot detect the
difference. Instead, a delicate device
utilizing mirrored quartz plates, ground
and polished to perfection, transforms
the wavelengths into concentric circles

CHROMIUM

COLOR FOR ARTISTS
The yellows, blues, and violets of the
artist's palette; the red of the ruby, the
green of the emerald — all come from
chromium, a metal named from the
Greek word chroma, meaning color.
Discovered in 1797, this metal was for
years just a laboratory curiosity, but is
now top-ranking among alloys.

SHIPS OF THE DESERT
Caravans of camels laden with chromite
ore have often formed the first link on an
assembly line thousands of miles long.
From the mines of Rhodesia, Turkey,
Russia, and India this valuable ore
starts its long journey to Electromet
furnaces, where dozens of different types
of chromium alloys are produced.

VERSATILE ALLOY
This silvery-white metal, used with steel
and iron in amounts from 1 to 35 per
cent, imparts many of its own desirable
properties. To stainless steels, chromium
gives resistance to heat, rust, and cor-
rosion—to heat-treated steels, strength
and resistance to shock—'to cast iron,
hardness and wear resistance.

NOT JUST SKIN DEEP
The luster of stainless steel withstands
all weather conditions—on streamlined
trains as well as on skyscrapers. For
hospital, food, and dairy equipment,
too, this steel is popular, since it is so
easy to clean and sterilize. And for the
oil and chemical industries, its resistance
to corrosion and heat makes it ideal.

BEARINGS TO BATTLESHIPS
Axles and armor plate, dies and drills,
shafts and springs — these are made
from engineering steels that must have
the hardness and strength necessary to
withstand wear and strain. That's why
engineers specify steels with 1 to 3 per
cent chromium for applications where
dependability is essential.
It's Been A Long Time
... since Electromet started to pro-
duce ferro-alloys — 40 years ago.
In fact, as far back as 1897, a plant
in Virginia, which later joined Elec-
tromet, was the first to produce
ferrochrome commercially in the
United States. Electromet is con-
stantly developing new and better
alloys, among them the low-carbon
ferrochrome essential in the pro-
duction of stainless steels. You will
learn more about chromium and
other alloys by writing to our
Technical Service Department for
the booklet, "Electromet Products
and Service."

Handling the high temperatures used
by modern industry is a tough job
— it requires materials with rugged
physical and thermal properties.
Norton has such materials in Alundum
and Crystolon abrasives. Their creation
in electric furnaces at temperatures of
3700° and 4000° Fahrenheit gives them
valuable refractory properties as well
as abrasive qualities. And supplement-
ing these two materials there are several
Norton electric furnace products which
are produced especially for their unique
refractory properties.
These various refractory materials are
put to effective use in Norton cements,
tubes, bricks, plates, tiles and other

on photographic film, and interpretation
of the patterns produced provides the
desired measurement.
Recording the speed and temperature
of the rocket jet by means of ordinary
instruments placed in the hot gas stream
is not possible because the instruments
would be burned up in a fraction of a
second. Furthermore, the shock waves
set up by introducing any stationary
object into the supersonic jet would
disturb the flow in such a way that
true readings could not be obtained.
Measurements must therefore be made
indirectly or by studying the light
radiated from the jet flames.
At present, electronic devices are used
to record thrust during test firings on
the ground. The average velocity of the
flame gases can be calculated from the
thrust, and the speed and range of the
rocket during flight can thus be esti-
mated. Dr. Bundy's measurements will
be used as a check against the electronic
tests and for more detailed studies of
the jet characteristics.
we're wrong
Contrary to popular belief, the ostrich
does not stick its head into the sand
when frightened or in danger.
Neither does the beaver work all the
time "like a beaver," nor does the bull
"see red" just because a red cloth is
waved in front of it.
The belief that the ostrich, when
frightened, sticks its head into the sand
can be traced clear back to Roman
times. Through twenty centuries of
time and all in the face of all that is
reasonable, millions of people believe
this to be true.
Living in a land where lions and other
predatory animals are ready to accom-
modate a bird so foolish, the ostrich
would have disappeared from the earth
if it stuck its head into the sand every
time danger approached.
Naturalists admit that the "busy
beaver" does work, but he does not
work all the time. When he works he
works hard, but he often loafs and plays
and observations prove that he does a
great deal of the latter. In addition the
beaver does not use his tail as a trowel,
nor does he drive stakes with it, or use
it as a sled to carry mud or other mate-
rials upon.

High-Pressure Synthesis Opens New Chemical Fields
A Challenge to Research Men
and Engineers
The use of techniques involving pres-
sures up to and above 1,000 atmospheres
(15,000 lbs. per sq. in.) has had a tre-
mendous influence on chemical manu-
facture in the past twenty-five years.
The availability of unlimited quanti-
ties of nitrates via ammonia from nitro-
gen of the air by high pressure synthesis
has greatly affected chemical economics
as well as agriculture.
The plastics industry, too, has bene-
fited greatly by the reduction in price
of urea from about 80ff lb. to less than
4£, and methanol (to give formalde-
hyde) from $1.25 gal. to less than 25j.
High pressure syntheses have also par-
ticipated in a major way in the devel-
opment of entirely new products such
as nylon and polythene. In fact, starting
from coal, air and water, Du Pont now
makes over 120 widely used products.
In addition to improving the existing
processes of manufacturing ammonia,
methanol, higher alcohols, urea and
other important chemicals, Du Pont
organic and physical chemists, chemi-
cal, mechanical and metallurgical engi-
neers have discovered and developed
high pressure syntheses for the follow-
ing: ethylene glycol; hexamethylene
diamine; acetic, propionic and hydroxy-
acetic acids; methyl formate; C«-, C10-
and C12- alcohols; and numerous others.
Advantages and Problems
The use of high pressures offers numer-
ous advantages familiar to technical
students, such as: (1) forcing an equi-
librium in the direction of a volume de-
crease, (2) overcoming the reversing
effect of high temperatures in exother-
mic reactions, (3) increasing reaction
and through-put rates and (4) provid-
ing, in some cases, a liquid phase which
might not otherwise be present.
The synthesis of urea from carbon
dioxide and ammonia is a good illus-
tration of some of these principles:
CO, + 2NH,
CO(NH,), + HjO
With three moles of reactants and only
two of resultants, increase of pressure
gives an expected increase in conversion.

A Battery of Hyper Compressors Used to Bring Gases up to 700-900
Atmospheres Pressure in the Ammonia and Methanol Syntheses.
At the same time, the gaseous reactants
are forced into the liquid phase to give
higher concentrations and again better
conversion. The reaction rate and there-
fore the rate of passage through the re-
action chamber are both increased by
increasing the temperature under high
pressure conditions. There are other
equilibrium considerations that affect
the industrial production of urea, but
they are too lengthy to discuss here.
Along with its advantages, the use of
high pressure gives rise to problems that
often severely tax the abilities of engi-
neers and chemists. For example, (1)
difficulties of design of packing glands,
valves, connecting rods, closures, etc.,
increase rapidly with increased pres-
sure, (2) extraordinary corrosion prob-
lems arise in which even stainless steels
are attacked and cannot be used, (3)
ordinary steels are permeable to hydro-
gen at higher pressures and tempera-
tures. These are but a few illustrations
of the challenge that high pressure
studies present to the technical man
and particularly to the metallurgical
and mechanical engineer.
High pressure synthesis has now be-
come a separate field of industrial chem-
istry with an apparently limit less future.
Questions College Men ask
about working with Du Pont
What kind of a technical
organizetion does Du Pont have?
There ran ten manufacturing depart-
ments 'ii Du Pont, each operating as a
separate organization and each with its
own rfsfiarch and engineering staff. In
addition, there is a central chemical de-
partment and a central engineering de-
partment. Consequently there is a wide
variety of research and engineering work
available to chemists, engineers and
other technical specialists. For further

What Does Industry Expect of Us?
As student engineers, we have
come to the University of Michigan
in pursuit of an education which will
enable us. we hope, to secure posi-
tions of great responsibility and use-
fulness in our social structure. Many
of us know exactly what work we
want to perform as our life's voca-

sure, and we follow the path of a
generalized engineering education, in
order that we may be as broadly pre-
pared as is possible, to assume any
one of a great variety of engineering
pursuits, depending upon the oppor-
tunities which will be available when
we are ready to leave college.
Most of us are not determined to
do one thing and nothing else. There-
fore, we are, to a large extent, in-
fluenced and directed by opportu-
nities, by the chance to get a job in
one type of work (engineering de-
sign, for instance), as weighed
against a desire, possibly, to work
into another field (engineering sales,
perhaps). Consequently, it is often
the most necessary and the wisest
policy to study a general field of en-
gineering rather than to specialize,
only to find that the preparation has
been too narrow to permit adaptation
to another phase of engineering.
In considering the goals of job-
placement and professional establish-
ment, we should not restrict our-
selves to our own selfish point of
view. Rather, what do the men who
hire engineers think about and evalu-
ate, when they are selecting new
men? Perhaps we cannot give a com-
plete answer, but we can at least
point out true facts and deduce sev-
eral important conclusions.
Every year many companies send
their personnel representatives to the
University, to interview thousands oi
prospective engineers for employ-
ment. These interviewers are trained
to make a comprehensive estimate
of a person's capabilities in a very
short time. A man's personal short-
comings will be only too apparent in
this sort of an interview; therefore,
they are quickly able to calculate
the man's social ease, shyness, or
bluffness. Before they interview a
man, however, these personnel ex-
perts will check a man's scholarship
and activities records, as a first im-
pression of that man. In the inter-
view they will be able to test the
man's ability to think under a cer-
tain mental strain, and they will as-
certain that person's mannerisms.
In considering a graduating senior
for a position, a company's repre-
sentatives will judge him on many
counts. One of the most important
is scholarship. Now, mere possession
of a degree will not prove anything;
it merely explains, very vaguely, that
person's activities for the past four
years. Even so, high scholarship is
a valuable goal to achieve, because
it is an effective index for determin-
ing a man's ability to do certain
specified tasks and to do them well.
Too many people go through college
with the intention merely to "get
through"; they don't realize that
failure to show well in their school-
work implies failure to accept re-
sponsibility and to exercise intiative.
High scholarship is not the only
index of a man's capabilities. Ex-
tra-curricular activities provide an-
other excellent means for determin-
ing a man's desirability. We should
remember that education is experi-
ence, and that a man's experiences
must be quite varied before he is a
well-balanced individual — socially
and technically. Often students can
"bury themselves in books," gaining
experience that is primarily techni-
cal and vicarious. We can learn
a lot about dealing with people by
engaging in extra activities (organi-
zations, fraternities, The Michigan
Technic, etc.). We can, as a re-
sult, be better-developed personali-
ties for this additional experience. In
fact, many companies place a higher
stress upon activities, rather than
very high scholarship, as a point in
favor of a man.
Added to scholarship and activ-
ities, favorable visual impressions
which one person conveys to another
will go far toward winning the other
person's confidence and admiration.
Company interviewers will judge ap-
plicants on alertness, appearance, ap-
parent personal integrity and many
other associated factors.
In engineering practice, a graduate
should remember that he is an "em-
bryo" engineer—he has yet to prove
his real worth as an engineer. There-
fore, he will need to continue his
studies in design, business subjects,
and all other topics associated with
his work.
In summary, industry expects and
looks for men with high intelligence,
who are socially developed, eager to
work with and for people, and who
will strive hard to further develop
their talents and usefulness to the
firms for whom they are working. By
working sincerely to fulfill these re-
quirements, by having great confi-
dence in our capacities to perform
well in engineering practice, by prov-
ing that we will be assets to an engi-
neering firm, and by having the en-
terprise to bargain for our services,
we can work toward happiness and
success in our chosen fields of work.
Personnel representatives will be able
to recognize confidence, ability, and
willingness to work.

Aeronautical Engineering is that branch of engineering w
craft of all types. It requires of its engineers a well-founded
problems which arise in the construction of a craft that is t

travel at 2500 miles per hour.
Aeronautical design is broken down into three fields:
aircraft; propulsion, the means of driving the craft; and str
of aviation into the speed range near and above the speed of s

GENERAL ELECTRI

AIR CONDITIONING ENGINEER
The Story of
BILL KNAUS
AT General Elcctric's Bloomfield,
J\_ N. J. plant, Bill Knaus is on
top of a job that isgrowingand sprout-
ing like a tropical plant. And like a
tropical plant, the job grows fastest
on the hottest days.
It grows every rime another home
owner thankfully breathes in the mid-
summer coolness and freshness of a
General Electric-conditioned movie
theatre and resolves, "This for my
house." As Engineer in Charge of
Bloomficld's Remote Equipment Engi-
neering Division, it's Bill's job to
direct the engineering of a variety of
air-conditioning equipment ranging
from room-coolers for homes to big
units for theatres and hotels.
Heat and cold—these have been
Bill's specialties since the early days
of his career with G.E. Of all the
various jobs he held on "Test," and of
the range of subjects he covered in the
Companv's Advanced Engineering
Program, he found that temperature
Croblems interested him most. By 1933
c was Heat Transfer Consultant of
the Engineering General Division at
Schenectady.
A year later he was transferred to
Fort Wayne to try his hand at im-
proving the effectiveness of refriger-
ating machines and condensing units.
In 1940 he became Section Engineer
of his plant's Development Section.
During the wartime years from '40
to '45, Bill worked on gunnery and
supercharger problems. But at war's
end he wanted -and was given—the
chance to resume his special interest.
Today Bill is top man of a group of
engineers working to bring clean,
cool, fresh air into our homes and
buildings.

An electrical engineering student at Washing-
ton U., Bill was chairman of his chapter of
AIEE. He came to General Electric in 1930.
He studied G-E engineering courses and worked
on "Test." One of his assignments was to
help with early trials of the Sonic Altimeter.

During the war Bill supervised work on power
drives for the 1.1 and 40mm Novy AA guns.
later he directed engineering at one of the
plants building the G-E lurbosuperchorger.
In the G-E Air Conditioning Department today.
Bill is in charge of engineering units that will
condition the air of theatres and hotels as
well as units for use in homes.
