ers in this country alone. ..an area of distri-
bution extending millions of miles upward
and outward.
The immediate business at hand: protecting
and sustaining the peace-our very survival.
There are some who would describe this
organization as non-profit. And there are
others, who would more thoughtfully deem
its investments, dividends, and assets noth-
ing less than priceless.
Today, thousands of selected young college
graduates are joining that organization in
responsible executive positions. They join to
serve as officers in the United States Air Force.
The resources at hand for the career devel-
opment of these applicants are matchless.
They are participating in the world's most

Government spending in the United States has grown so
vast that in a 15-month period it would be sufficient to buy
up everything that Soviet Russia produced in one year, in-
cluding financing the Russian armed forces and all missile
work.
In 1960, federal, state, and local governments in this
country spent $190 billion. The federal government alone
accounted for $130 billion. The large size of government
spending is generally not known. For one thing, most people
consider that the federal budget reveals all federal spending.
Omitted are billions spent on highways, Social Security and
other programs not included in the budget.
The American governments were cradled on the concept
of limited government, but they now spend nearly 40% of
our Gross National Product.
The largest facet of government spending, aside from the
necessary defense expenditures, is for the public social welfare
programs, totaling an overwhelming $37 billion in 1961! This
amount is as large or larger than our ten year program for
landing a man on the moon.
Unemployment and workmen's compensation totaled
nearly $6 billion in 1961, and this was a year of economic
recovery. But welfare programs involve costs not only in
money, but in morale, too.
Commerce Secretary Luther Hodges, in a national tele-
vision broadcast, said:
"We are soft in this country. We have gotten a little bit
careless and complacent. I think although we still have the
spirit of enterprise .... that the average man and woman
is not giving his full day of enthusiasm that he ought to."
There have been cases where a man receives more money on
relief than he would after payroll deductions by working.
After a while a man loses his self-respect and capacity to
work. He becomes unable to teach his children the age-old
truth that man must work to live.
Surprisingly enough, President Roosevelt spoke out
against relief in 1935 after two years of relief payments dur-
ing the Great Depression, when he said:
"The lessons of history show conclusively that continued
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


integration fundamentally destructive to the national fiber.
To dole out relief in this way is to administer a narcotic, a
subtle destroyer of the human spirit."
These welfare programs are paid for by those that do
work, further decreasing the incentive to work. This is illus-
trated by the recent increase in Social Security tax to 614%,
and which is scheduled to reach 9|4% by 1968. Where does
this end? Former Secretary of Health, Education, and Wel-
fare, Ribicoff, said that he thought 10% was the limit that
people would stand for in Social Security taxes. But what
will government demand 10 or 20 years from now?
Most people are aware of their payroll deductions, but
are unaware that the employer must pay taxes on each em-
ployee, which further reduces his effective wage.
We are already committed to spending large amounts of
tax money, but perhaps the line can be held to prevent fur-
ther mushrooming of government spending and government
control. Senator Harry Byrd (D. W. Va.), chairman of the
Senate Finance Committee has said that the government has
future committments of $1 trillion.
It is now impossible to prevent spending as it is known
today, but through voter pressure, further increases can be
avoided. We must re-evaluate our thinking and try to see
the road we are travelling. The other alternative is much
greater government control!

Let's look at the price of eggs
What did you pay for eggs this week? Probably a little more or a little less than last week. Prices of things go
up and down because of many factors . . . such as supply and demand, wages, materials and shipping costs,
and needed profits. It all gets more complex when you consider taxes and competition, or compare our econ-
omy to that of other countries. ► Now millions of people can learn more about economics from a stimulating
series of television programs on The American Economy. Conducted by leading educators and economists,
"College of the Air" will describe how our economic system works . . . how it provides stability and growth
.. . how it enhances individual freedom. Starting this fall, The American Economy will appear on the CBS
television network as five one-half hour programs per week for 32 weeks . . . equal to two semesters of col-

tomorrow, American business is giving financial support to "College of the Air." The people of
Union Carbide are proud to be among the donoro to such a worthwhile project.

I HAVE
REKA!
FOUND
IT!
by Ullmann Kilgore
An abridged version of the Cooley
Essay winner for 1962. The author
enumerates and belabors society's ills. He
then argues that since society must pro-
gress towards a Utopian state and since
the engineer's sole business is progress,
the planners of society should be engi-
neers (or at least users of the engineering
approach). Certain principles are pre-
sented as being fundamental.
Two dozen seashore property own-
ers, who had lost some of their soil
through erosion during a storm, or-
ganized a public meeting to discuss
a preventive program and invited an
elderly civil engineer to sit with them.
One of the owners stated that he had
driven some stakes and piled brush
between them and was sure he had
lost less land than most others. Then
they got into a long argument about
the best kind of brush, the supply of
it from neighboring farmers, cost of
cutting and hauling, etc.
All this time the old engineer had
sat glumly silent. When asked to give
his opinion on the dispute, he stood
up red-faced and visibly in a bad hu-
mor. "Ladies and gentlemen, sea
water weighs sixty-four pounds per
cubic foot. At seventy miles an hour,
every cubic foot of it lands with an
energy of almost ten thousand foot-
pounds. And you're talking about
stopping it by driving some damned
stobs." He then thrust his hat on his
head and stamped out of the hall.
That old gentleman is the author's
lifelong hero and model, and the
story is told to indicate the kind of
approach this aspiring engineer pled-
ges himself to try to take on every
question he meets as long as he lives.
Admittedly it is not a very imagin-
ative way to live, but a man need not
be unhappy simply because he is not
satisfied with pipe dreams.
It is not pipe dreaming if an en-
gineer speculates on ways he could
improve the work of previous genera-
tions. He has a right to consider what
kind of social, political and economic
circumstances would be best for him
to live and to enjoy his job. The es-
sential quality required in any scheme
would be that change take place on
a wide scale and at a good rate, for
it is obvious that once the wheels
start turning the engineer is thence-
forth nothing but a maintenance man
if needed at all. On the other hand, in
stagnant civilizations there are no
engineers as such, as is easily ob-
served in history until only a century
ago. The demand for our services is
a direct function of the rate of change.
Accordingly, the attitude an engi-
neer should have towards Utopia,
and utopianism may be surmised
in advance. There should be two
kinds of circumstances which the en-
gineer would prevent if he could:
one, that in which change had become
unnecessary; the other, that in which
readaptation, improvement or inno-
vation occurred by decree and in
which he would be required to sub-
mit his ideas first, not to the appraisal
of his learned peers, but to the test
of doctrine.
Utopianism no longer designates
harmless idealization of the social
model, although by dictionaries that
is the only meaning of utopianism.
Dictionaries by necessity report the
facts after they have happened. The
appellation, Utopian, has been applied
so often to social and economic plan-
ners that it has stuck, and by this
time, if in a public assembly the de-
mand were shouted, "Is there a
Utopian in the house?" we would not
be surprised to see one spring defiant-
ly to his feet. Utopianism is that class
of doctrine which would have the ac-
OCTOBER, 1962
13


or the destiny of whole groups includ-
ing the entire world, directed by au-
thority according to designs of quali-
fied planners. The process of obtain-
ing a planner's license need not be
described since it is pretty well under-
stood by everybody. This is sub-
stantially the idea that the American
public has of utopianism, and it
exactly suits the present purpose.
Let it be understood that our
definition of utopianism is not re-
stricted to doctrines of drastic, sudden
and violent reorganization of society,
but that idle and irresolute dreamings
are included. Day-dreaming is a secret
practice of no general concern. As
Laurence Sterne said, "Have not the
wisest men of all ages, not excepting
Solomon himself, have they not had
their hobby-horse? .... And so long
as a man rides hobby-horses peaceably
and quietly along the king's highway,
and neither compels you nor me to
get up behind him—pray, sir, what
have either you or I to do with it?"
In America, it seems to the elders
that there is not much to rebel
against. There actually are smug peo-
ple in this country who believe that
this is a regular Utopia already. They
ought to go to the eye-doctor and
have their bifocals fitted with medi-
um-distance lenses, for they cannot
now see things at the distance of their
finger tips. If they were curious, they
might ask. They might ask the two
students who were arrested and jailed
in Baton Rouge, La., because the
sheriff did not like the color of their
jackets or the cuts of their beards.
They might ask any of the twenty
million Negroes in the country, the
catalog of whose sorrows is so well
known that it is needless to enumer-
ate them. They might ask some of
the millions of unemployed for whom
a mighty nation, supposedly resource-
ful, cannot find honorable employ-
ment. They might read the series in
the Saturday Evening Post (March,
1962)—the story of the million boys a
year we waste, utterly waste. Let them
take note of the enormous price-fixing
conspiracy in the electrical industry
last year, or notice the scandal of
brokerage deals in government con-
tracts that fouls the front page right
today.
Free enterprise in this country is a
mockery: a farmer in Wisconsin was
made a criminal because he planted
some wheat to feed to his chickens;
government commissions are sitting
as courts of law, presuming to ob-
serve court procedure, over "cases"
where the only crimes have been the
owners' desire to sell what they own
at prices they chose to accept; chem-
ical and drug manufacturers are be-
ing harassed before a Senate com-
mittee because they spent millions of
dollars on research to produce suc-
cessful products and now want to re-
cover their costs.
The catalog of things we have to
rebel against would make Sears-Roe-
buck's look like a pocket manual. If
we included the bellyaches of the
esthetes who stand around the Mich-
igan Union it would grow beyond all
bounds, but the sober gripes of en-
gineers ought to be long enough. This
list is short, because there is no better
way to bore company than to tell
troubles, also because these are topics
which only one man, not a profession-
al griper, notes in a quick glance, and
again, if you please, because he is an
engineer.
Consider the boy brought up in a
nice middle class American home,
fed the Flag and the Holy Bible,
Good Sportsmanship, Good Citizen-
ship, Carry Out Your Contracts (like
Dad does, you know.) Good Manners,
Sanctity of Womanhood, Always Deal
in Cold Cash Whenever Possible (be-
cause the Bureau of Internal Revenue
can't trace it.)
Is it any wonder that when he gets
out and sees what goes on in the
world, he feels pretty sick at the stom-
ach? No wonder some of them become
beatniks. To tell the truth, our civili-
zation is rotten. (Admittedly a per-
sonal conviction.) It may help some;
however, if we know it and own up
to it.
Of all the phony institutions in this
country, our educational system is
about the phoniest. Although there
are a few good schools, across the na-
tion it is no trouble to find plenty
that are downright sorry.
Although university students and
professors assume that the best brains
in the country are concentrated in
our great seats of learning, particu-
larly in the University of Michigan,
the fact is that many of the land's
most clever people are fitting pipe,
tending babies, keeping shop, gam-
bling for a living, and some of them
are in prisons. The reasons why their
abilities go into trifling or vain en-
deavors are sometimes justifiable
private reasons, but often simply that
they had no incentive to gain knowl-
edge. They had no taste for intellect-
ual discipline because they were born
into a society where intellectual dis-
cipline was not fashionable, where all
mass communications—radio, televi-
sion, movies, newspapers, advertising,
magazines and most books—are ad-
dressed to morons. If all these good
minds could be made to desire learn-
ing passionately, just think what a
world this might become.
It might appear that this inability
to match the talents of the indivual
with productive pursuit is the result
of our ignorance, but paradoxically
the failure is nowhere more glaring
than in our universities. (See a little
book by George Williams, Some of
My Best Friends Are Professors.)
According to Professor Williams, the
failure begins with the incompetence
of the admissions committees, basing
decisions on qualifications tests de-
monstrably absurd, and it is consum-
mated by incompetent teachers who
follow deliberate policies of attrition.
The Professor declares that it is im-
possible to flunk the cream of the
cream if they are given half a chance
to learn.
The reason for calling attention to
the folly of our educational system is
that a good many, admittedly not all,
of our deficiencies begins with the in-
crease of human knowledge.
It has been a slow trip from patient
old Alcuun's library to here. It has
been half a milennium since Leonar-
do da Vinci and Columbus posed
hypotheses about man's environment
and undertook experiments to test
their speculations. They melted a
little of the ice. Then the trickle grew,
Vesalius, Galileo, Regiomontanus,
Copernicus, Vieta, fashioning tools
and demonstrating methods by which
the mind could make nature under-
standable. In the seventeenth century
came the great intellectual tide,
heroic names like Descartes, Fermat,
Sanctorius, Napier, Helley, Harvey,
accompanied by hundreds of curious
pioneers like Leeuwenhoek, Fahren-
heit, Ray and Willoughby, Pascal and
Desargues, Boyle, Malpighi, and the
two who must not be mentioned in
the same breath with any others,
Leibniz and Newton. After them his-
tory is so crowded with the memory
of magnificent discoveries that it
would be unjust to name any few ex-
cept Gauss and Einstein. Truly, in
Newton's words, we stand on the
shoulders of giants.
Never were children so lavishly en-

ing. Nor do we have any reason to
live off the interest, for we have such
tools for new exploration as our
fathers never dreamed of. We con-
struct new planets, and duplicate the
temperature of the sun. We say we
shall channel the winds and dictate
the climate of whole nations. We ex-
pect to produce life itself.
What shall we do with this glitter-
ing heritage? With all this treasure, is
there any reason why we should con-
tinue to operate an establishment
where each member were less than
completely happy?
Has not the hour arrived? The lady
writing to the editor complains over
and over again, "Surely, if men are in-
telligent enough to build computers,
if they are intelligent enough to
launch a satelite . . . surely ..."
Have we crossed the bar, and are we
now outside on the great, blue ocean?
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
What's holding us back? Is it that
all we need is a captain to plot the
course, while the rest of us man this
ship?
Since engineers are in the business
of progress and nothing else, we ought
to be invited to testify as interested
parties. If they want to design a new
project, they ought to come to us,
since we specialize in design. We have
a careful procedure for going about
this, and if they will employ our tal-
ents they will find our fee well spent.
The steps are as follows:
1. Thorough understanding of
what the client wants.
2. Study of the general principles
involved in the problem.
3. Detailed examination of the

Certainly if the Utopians found out
how we were going to proceed, they
would not retain us. But on the
chance that someday we might be
offered the job of designing a Utopia,
we'll run through it.
1. Fortunately, the client knows
pretty well what he wants. He wants
everybody to be happy. It seems un-
necessary to prove that his goal re-
quires the elimination of war, disease,
insanity, crime, divorce, restrictions
on sexual freedom, elimination of all
taxes on beer, wine and spirits, and
the supply of a yellow Jaguar for
every student—at least for every en-
gineering student.
2. The general principles. Obvious-
ly, it is fundamentally necessary, if
this project is going to work, that the
human race be amenable to improve-
ment, for it is certainly not at present
in a fit state of morals, health, mental
capacity or aims to conform to a per-
fect society. That any improvement
is possible is a proposition mighty
hard to prove. There is, however,
some evidence to the contrary.
Man has such a capacity for justi-
fying his acts that if we were looking
down on the show with superhuman
perception we would burst out laugh-
ing. As Dr. Samuel Johnson said, "We
are easily shocked by crimes which ap-
pear at once in their full magnitude;
but the gradual growth of our wick-
edness, endeared by interest and
palliated by all the artifices of self-
deceit, gives us time to form distinc-
tions in our favor." Dostoevsky's opin-
ion: "Everybody loves crime, they
love it always. It's as though people
have made an agreement to lie about
it, and have lied about it ever since.
They all declare that they hate evil,
but secretly they all love it." Note
that in Crime and Punishment Ras-
kolnikov was something of a Utopian
himself. All Utopians are Raskolnikovs
under the skin.
By his own standards, without in-
troducing any trancendental criteria,
man is wicked, vile, perfidious, base
and deceptive. He is covetuous and
greedy, rapacious even with his own
kind, and his desire for more is in-
satiable. Any doctrine that he is in-
nately good is contrary to all the
evidence, in agreement with no gen-
uine evidence which has yet been
produced, and is therefore hogwash.
(Not a Personal Conviction but a
valid statistical deduction.)
3. Examination at the site. It un-
doubtedly is obvious by this time that
at least one engineer has disqualified
himself for designing a Utopia. The
balance of the report will therefore
be short. Consider some dear notions
that impede constructive thinking on
the nature of this species.
People have to be taught to hate,
it is popular to say. Saying it must
satisfy them. Suspicion of the stranger,
fear of the monstrous or of the mere-
ly different, are as inevitable in the
human community as the pecking
order is in the chicken community.
The fact is rather that people have to
be taught not to hate, and there is
no assurance that they will not substi-
tute a new hatred for the one aban-
doned. It is true that enlightened peo-
ple—college professors, for instance-
do not hate anybody, and love every-
body, but students, but such is not
true among what we call the common
people (whom God must have loved,
says Henry Miller, because He made
them so common.)
Hatred is actually a spiritual need,
necessary for good health, like sex
and beer, and a friend has proposed
to put the trait to work in a noble
cause. What these people need, he
says, is a race everybody can hate, and
continue to hate, all over the world.
The only thing that is keeping the
world disunited is the lack of a com-
mon object of hatred. As it is they
have nobody to hate but each other.
But consider the Martians. They
would make excellent objects of hat-
red. They are ugly. They are mean.
Well, so are the Jews ugly and mean,
but the Martians are a lot uglier and
meaner. We could declare war on
them, and the whole world could
squander its resources, not just the
United States. Just think what a
brotherhood! Chinamen, Russians,
Yanquis, Cubans, Negroes, Jews,
Arabs, Dagoes, Okies, Spicks and
Catholics, all hating the Martians to-
gether. Our crackpots have had their
heads so far up in the clouds, they
couldn't recognize this ineluctable
trait, but the Nazis and the Commu-
nists certainly have not ignored it.
Surely, says the good lady, it is not
natural for man to kill his fellow
men, war is provoked by blind and
selfish leaders, and by . . . Sorry,
madam. Your noble wish will not
work as a scientific hypothesis. Pic-
ture the stalwart husband at the

advanced fields of inquiry today. As a

The authors, to satisfy their own
curiosity and to dispell the above illu-
sion, made arrangements to visit the
Mental Health Research Center and
talk with various people currently en-
gaged in psychological research. We
attempted to select projects that
would be of interest to engineers.
The problems of the experimental
psychologist are much the same as the
problems of any experimental scien-
tist: to explain certain natural phe-
nomena using the scientific method
as the tool for arriving at the expla-
nation. The psychologist's phenomena
are, of course, considerably different
from those of the psysicist or
chemist. The goal of the psychol-
ogist is to understand and explain
human behavior. How does an indi-
vidual react to different situations of
physical and mental stress? Can the
behavior of an individual be accurate-
ly predicted under a given set of cir-
cumstances? How does the human
mind learn? What factors determine
intelligence? How do individuals in-
teract in a group? What causes mental

illness? These are just a few of the
questions which psychologist's are
currently trying to answer.
Rats are, to many people, the sym-
bol of the experimental psychologist.
Why rats? For several reasons. First,
they are easy to obtain and care for.
But, more important, they are mam-
als and in many ways anatomically
similar to the human species. What is
learned from studying rats (and other
animals) may, in the future, be ap-
plied to human beings. With the
above in mind, we can look at some
of the experimentation which is cur-
rently being carried out here at The
University of Michigan's Mental
Health Research Center.
Learning
The first project visited, was under
the direction of Dr. R. W. Gerard
and was being carried out under Dr.
Rothschild. His research primarily
concerns the physical process of learn-
ing. Dr. Rothschild is interested in
what is called the "engram" of
learning; that is, changes which
occur in the nervous system when
an organism learns. The engram is
thought to consist of two phases: the
dynamic and static.
For example, consider the following
experiment. Two rats learn a maze.
One is given an electro-convulsive
shock right after learning while the
other is given the same shock twenty
minutes later. When re-tested, the first
rat has "forgotten" the maze, but the
second shows no sign of forgetting.
Thus, it seems that there is some pro-
cess going on in the first twenty min-
utes which permanently "fixes" mem-
ory, which the shock interrupted
in the case of the first rat. The first
twenty minutes is thought of as the
dynamic state, while the state after
that is considered the static or fixed
state.
In order to study this engram, a
means of manipulating the learning
process is needed. At present there
are several ways to do this. One way is
to lesion the cerebellum, one of the
principal organs of the central ner-
vous system, of a rat. This causes the
rat's posture to become assymetrical,
that is, one side of the rat extends and
the other retracts. This is apparently
caused by changes in the control im-
pulses to the spinal cord. After about
forty-five minutes, when the spinal
cord is cut, the rat remains assymetri-
cal. It seems, then, that the spinal
cord has "learned" and "remembered"
that the cerebellum was lesioned.
Though this isn't exactly what is com-
monly thought of as learning, the
spinal cord has gone through a physi-
cal change which is very similar to
other types of learning. Now that
learning has been "caused" in one
side of the spinal cord (for the lesion
affects one side of the cord only) it
is logical to try and find differences
in the two sides of the cord. This is
done by measuring the D.C potential
of the sides of the cord and by using
radio-active tracers to detect differ-
ences in chemical activity. Occasion-
ally the potential of individual neu-
rons are measured with micro equip-
ment.
It is not proven, but it seems
reasonable to assume that learning is
coded in some manner. This is in
line with the fact that organisms are
known to store genetic information
by means of a code (the ordering of
nucleotides in the DNA molecule is
the genetic coding system).
In research, one often needs to
make an educated guess and then
test its validity. One such guess is that
the RNA molecule, which is essen-
tial to protein formation, might also
be the coding device of the nervous
system.
One way to test this hypothesis is
to administer to an organism, drugs
which interfere in some way with
RNA. An approach which is being
tried, is to attempt to alter the fixa-
tion time (the time it takes for the
spinal cord to learn so that it won't
"forget") in the previously mentioned
lesion experiment.
If the spinal cord is cut sooner than
forty-five minutes after the lesion the
rat's posture soon becomes symetrical
(the spinal cord "forgets"); however,
if the cord is cut after forty-five min-
utes, the posture remains assymetrical.
When a drug called eight quaziquin-
ine, an anti-metabolite, is adminis-
tered, the fixation time appears to
lengthen, and Dr. Rothchild believes
that there is a change in the nucleo-
tides of the RNA molecule. The
opposite approach is to use an RNA
stimulating drug in an effort to short-
en the fixation time. The drug in
this case, Upjohn U9189, a dimer of
malenol nitryle, hasn't any definite
results and more work is indicated.
Rats are also being tested in what
is called a Head Williams maze. This
is a modular maze which consists of
squares and barriers. Experimentation
has shown that the rats learn this
maze at different rates depending on
which of the above drugs are admin-
istered.

Modern instruments used in conjunc-
tion with the shock tube are becoming
important tools for basic research.
The problems of supersonic flight
and re-entry of space vehicles have
necessitated the detailed study of
shock waves. To aid in this study,
physicists have perfected the shock
tube, a device for producing shock
waves under precisely controlled lab-
oratory conditions.
In the early part of the last decade,
workers observed that a shock wave
of sufficient strength would cause a
gas to become luminous, hence a
strong shock could be used as an
energy source to excite an element to
the point where it could be studied
spectroscopically. Currently the lum-
inous shock tube is a principle device
for studying various atomic effects, as
transition probabilities and the Stark
effect.
What Are Shock Waves?
Everyone has heard the loud boom
when an aircraft exceeds the speed
of sound. This is an example of
a shock wave. An ordinary sound
is generated by slight pressure changes
(compressions and rarefactions) pro-
duced, for example, by a vibrating
string. The string ocillates and in the
process pushes the air molecules ahead
of it. Each molecule hits another af-
ter travelling just a short distance,
and the net effect is the propagation
of a sound wave. Everyday sounds in-
volve a pressure difference of 1/100
to 1/1000 of an atmosphere. A shock
wave, on the other hand, involves
pressure changes of several atmos-
pheres.
It is common knowledge that a
sound wave travels with a character-
istic velocity which is a function of
temperature. Furthermore, a rise in
temperature accompanies the com-
pression of a gas. Since an ordinary
sound wave is produced by small com-
pression waves, it is easy to under-
stand that there will be a small tem-
perature rise accompanying the sound
wave. However, a shock wave and its
violent compression will heat a gas
considerably. The stronger the shock,
the more the gas is heated; hence, the
faster the shock travels. The pressure
difference is so great that a disconti-
nuity in the flow pattern of the gas
results. This discontinuity is, in fact,
the definition of a shock wave.
Mathematically Speaking
The flow of an ideal fluid can be
described by a set of three partial
differential equations: the continuity
equation, conservation of mass, and
thermodynamic relations. By making
various substitutions and a few as-
sumptions to account for the condi-
tions of the shock wave, one can
solve the equations and arrive at a
situation where there is a mathe-
matical discontinuity in them such
that all of the flow variables are dis-
continuous. Such a discontunity is
called a shock wave.1 Also, from
thermodynamic considerations, the
change in entropy across the shock
cannot be negative. This implies that
a gas can only be compressed and
never rarefied as a shock wave moves
through it. Therefore, a shock wave
always results in heating the gas.
Other useful quantities associated
with the mathematics of the situation
are the shock strength and the Mach
number. The shock strength is de-
fined as the ratio of the pressure in
front of the shock to the pressure be-
hind. The equations show that an
equilibrium situation ( which implies
constant pressure) exists on both sides
of the shock wave, and the shock
wave is a discontinuity that separates
the two regions of equilibrum. The
Mach number is defined as the ratio
of the local fluid velocity to the local
sound speed. This particular number
is useful because it can often be mea-
sured directly; consequently, other
How variables can be determined.
The Shock Tube
So much for the definition of a
shock wave; on to the shock tube. In
18
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


sists of a long tube of constant cross
section, separated by a breakable dia-
phragm. The pressure in one section
(compression chamber) is elevated to
several times the pressure of the other
section (expansion chamber.) The
diaphragm separating the high and
low pressure regions is then broken
(either by mechanical probing or
self-bursting); the high pressure
gas, acting as a piston, expands and
compresses the low pressure gas ahead
of it. This compression region be-
comes the shock front. An interface,
separating the low and high pressure
gas, travels with flow velocity down
the tube. On one side of the interface
there is a cold flow region due to ex-
pansion and on the other side, be-
tween the interface and the shock
front, there exists a hot flow region
due to compression.
An example of a typical shock tube
used for studying the hydrodynamic
aspects of a shock wave is found in
the shock tube laboratory of the Uni-
versity of Michigan physics depart-
ment. It is constructed of steel plates
welded together, with periodic pro-
visions along its length for the instal-
lation of observation windows. It
measures 2 inches by 7 inches (rec-
tangular) in cross section and is about
30 feet long. The compression and
expansion chambers are separated by
a thin aluminum sheet which is
broken by a mechanical probe.
Instrumentation
In this particular apparatus, the
shock strength is not sufficient to
cause luminosity, therefore observa-
tion becomes a problem. To illustrate
the type of phenomenon that can be
studied and the method used for ob-
servation, consider the practical prob-
lem of a plane breaking the sound
barrier. One can investigate the inter-
action of the shock wave with the
nose of the plane. To do this in a
shock tube, an obstacle of the desired
shape is placed in the test section near
the end of the compression chamber.
A window is situated in the test
section such that a beam of light can
be passed through the shock tube
perpendicular to the direction of mo-
tion. The shock tube is located in
one arm of a Mach-Zehnder interfer-
ometer. As the shock wave passes into
the test section, the optical path of
the beam of light is changed, causing
an interference pattern to form. This
interference pattern is focused on the
focal plane of a camera and photo-
graphed. Physically, the interfero-
meter records density changes, but it
is obvious that the density changes
outline the flow. Thus the interfer-
ence pattern represents the "foot-
prints" of the shock wave.
The velocity of the shock wave is
determined using a system of photo-
multiplier tubes and a thin beam of
light. The refractive index of the
medium is a function of the density.
A beam of light is passed through the
tube (perpendicular to the long axis.)
As the shock wave passes, the refrac-
tive index changes such that the light
is directed onto the photomultiplier
tube. The tube emits an electrical
signal which triggers a time counter.
Further down the tube at an accur-
ately known position is located an-
other photomultiplier tube. The sig-
nal from this tube stops the counter,
hence the time between stations and
the distance is known; therefore veloc-
ity can easily be determined.
The pressure at any given point
(which will be a function of time)
can be determined using a quartz
crystal transducer. (A more familiar
application of quartz crystal is in the
pickup cartridge of microphones and
hi-fi equipment). Changes in pressure
cause the quartz crystal to emit a
signal (piezoelectric effect), which is
directly proportional to the pressure.
With appropriate electronics, the sig-
nal is conveyed to an oscilloscope
where, on the single sweep mode of
operation, the signal is photographed.
Thus one has a permanent picture of
the pressure profile at any given point
in the tube.
Analysis of the interferometer pic-
tures reveals the characteristics of the
shock wave and the effect of the ob-
stacle on the flow pattern. Knowing
the velocity, temperature, and press-
ure, other quantities can be calculated
from the hydrodynamic equations.
Therefore, the complete anatomy of
the shock wave can be determined.
The House on the Hill
Before changing the subject to
luminous shock tubes and spectro-
scopy, an interesting application of
the shock tube should be mentioned.
In the shock tube, all phenomenon
can be considered one dimensional.
However, by inserting a wedge of ap-
propriate design in the test section, a
cylindrical wave can be created when
the plane wave is reflected from the
wedge. It so happens that an atomic
bomb (or any large bomb) detonated
some distance from the ground, gen-
erates a spherical wave. However, this
spherical wave, upon reflection from
the ground is repropagated as a cylin-
drical wave. The damage caused by
such a blast is due to the cylindrical
wave front. The House on the Hill
Project, carried out several years ago
using Michigan's 2 by 7 shock tube,
was designed for the study of such
cylindrical waves, in an effort to ex-

Pressure differential type shock tube. This particular one used for spectrographic
work. Note rectangular window on left end which is test section. In foreground

amine the events that occur when a
cylindrical wave interacts with an ob-
stacle resulting in the annihilation of
said obstacle. Results: classified.
Luminous Shock Tubes
About 1952 various workers ob-
served that a shock of sufficient
strength caused a gas to become lum-
inous. One can readily understand
this by recalling the hot flow region
between the interface and the shock
front. The temperature becomes high
enough so that the outer electrons
are boosted to higher than normal
energy levels. These excited electrons
will emit light in transition from the
excited state to the normal state. The
temperature in this region has been
found to be in the range 4,000° to
8,000° K. (The electric shock tube,
to be discussed later, produces tem-
peratures as high as 100,000° K.)

Time resolved photo of luminous shock
wave made with rotating drum camera.
Positive time axis is vertical. Since this is
negative, dark areas actually are high
intensity. Thus, this represents intensity
as a function of time.
This situation produces a perfect
emission spectra which can be anal-
ized by standard spectrographic tech-
nique. The wave length of the lines
present can be easily determined.
Among other things, electron densi-
ty, excitation potential and atomic
transition probabilities can be cal-
culated using the wavelength of the
line or energy relations implied by
the existence of a particular line. (For
example, a line represents the trans-
istion of an electron between two
energy states. Knowing the line one
has some clue as to the energy of the
shock.)
Quantities can be determined by
measuring certain parameters (i.e.
temperature, pressure and wave-
length.) and assuming the gas to be
fully ionized and in thermal equilib-
rium. By manipulating the hydro-
dynamic and thermodynamic equa-
tions of shocks with the Maxwell-
Boltzmann equation and the law of
mass action in its quantum statistical
form (the Saha equation) to arrive at
an expression that relates the known
parameters to the unknowns one
hopes to determine.2
To study a particular element the
high pressure chamber is brought to
400 to 500 psi (hydrogen is frequently
used as the driver gas) while the ex-
pansion chamber is maintained at 1
cm Hg (usually neon). The neon is
then "flavored" with the element in
question. Because in any section of
the tube a succession of events occurs
with time, the spectrum must be
time resolved. This is done by replac-
ing the conventional spectrographic
plate with a film wrapped around a
drum which rotates about 10,000 rpm.
(Such high speeds are necessary be-
cause the duration of an event is on
the order of milliseconds.) The dis-
persion of wavelength runs across the
film; time runs along the length. Sim-
ultaneously with the spectroscopy,
space-time photographs are made, also
with a rotating drum camera. Since
the shock wave is luminous, it exposes
the film leaving an accurate trace of
the progress of the shock wave.
Enter Astronomer
Why study such subjects that seem
so far removed from anything prac-
tical? Answer: for the sake of science,
pure science. The knowledge gained
from the spectrograph study of vari-
ous elements is invaluable to the as-
tronomer. Using the same technique
as the shock tubist, the astronomer
studies the stars. But the only thing
an astronomer can measure with any
great degree of accuracy is the wave-
length of the various lines of the
spectrum. From this he must deduce
such things as the abundance of the
elements in the stars and the tempera-
ture of the star.
The Stark effect (line broadening
due to external electric fields) can be
studied very well in a shock tube. The
broadening of argon lines and their
shift to the red may be related to the
red shift, so commonly observed by
astronomers. Therefore, by studying
the Stark effect and what effects press-
ure, temperature, and electron den-
sity have on it, the shock tubist is
able to tell the astronomer what to
expect, and may possibly help to ex-
plain the red shift.
Electric Discharge Tube
Within the last few years another
type of shock tube has been devel-

Learning never stops for engineers at Western Electric
There's no place at Western Electric for engineers who feel
that college diplomas signify the end of their education.
However, if a man can meet our quality standards and feels
that he is really just beginning to learn . . . and if he is
ready to launch his career where learning is an important
part of the job and where graduate-level training on and off
the job is encouraged — we want and need him.
At Western Electric, in addition to the normal learning-
while-doing, engineers are encouraged to move ahead in
their fields by several types of educational programs.
Western maintains its own full-time graduate engineering
training program, seven formal management courses, and a
tuition refund plan for out-of-hours college study.
This learning atmosphere is just one reason why a career
at Western Electric is so stimulating. Of equal importance,
however, is the nature of the work we do. Our new engi-
neers are taking part in projects that implement the whole
art of modern telephony from high-speed sound transmission
and solar cells, to electronic telephone offices and computer-
controlled production techniques.
Should you join us now, you will be coming to Western
Electric at one of the best times in the company's history.
In the management area alone, several thousand supervisory
jobs are expected to open up to W.E. people within the next
10 years. And our work of building communications equip-
ment and systems becomes increasingly challenging and
important as the communications needs of our nation and
the world continue to increase.
Challenging opportunities exist now at Western Electric for electrical,
mechanical, industrial, and chemical engineers, as well as physical
science, liberal arts, and business majors. All qualified applicants will
receive careful consideration for employment without regard to race,
creed, color or national origin. For more information about Western
Electric, write College Relations, Western Electric Company, Room 6205,

PRE-ELECTION SUPPLEMENT
ROMNEY-SWAINSON INTERVIEW
The 1962 Michigan elections are very important from sev-
eral viewpoints. The Democrats have held the Governorship for
fourteen years, and it has been said that if the Republicans
cannot win this year, the two party system will be dead in
Michigan. There are many important issues at stake, among
which are the proposed constitution, and fiscal reform, in-
cluding an income tax.
As a result, voter interest has been at an all-time high,
and the campaign has been quite strenuous for both the guber-
natorial candidates and the two parties. With this in mind,
the TECHNIC sent a questionnaire to Governor John B. Swainson
and Mr. George Romney.

1. What do you consider to be Michigan's most pressing needs?
SWAINSON:
ROKNEY:
There is no doubt that the most pressing needs are eco-
nomic growth and fiscal reform. A fair and equitable
tax structure will allow Michigan to respond to the
social and physical needs so very evident in our state.
A fair and equitable tax structure would do much to
stimulate economic growth to provide needed jobs today
and tomorrow. A fair and equitable tax structure would
help us provide the efficient, economical, state govern-
ment we need to be responsive to the needs of our people
...including education, mental health, recreation and
care of our senior citizens.
The number one issue in this state is leadership—leader-
ship dedicated to the best interest of all the people
and not a select few; leadership that knows that progress
can be made only through cooperation and not by name-
calling and political trickery; leadership that recog-
nizes public office not as an end in itself, but only as
a means by which the public can be served.
The number one problem in Michigan is one sided special
interest government. Michigan badly needs a true public
administration, with the accent on the public. Govern-
ment should not be primarily responsive to the wishes
of the tight handful of officials of a single special
interest, but should be responsible to all the people.
Special treatment for a single group actually does that
group no favor, because members of that group will suffer
along with the rest of the state—and perhaps even more.
The number one economic need in this state today is jobs.
Only through increased and diversified economic growth
can new and better jobs be provided. And until the eco-
nomy grows, Michigan will be unable to fill our unmet
needs in such areas as education, health and welfare.
2. How would you straighten out the so-called "financial mess"?
ROMNEY: Solving the state*s financial mess is a key to our
economic growth. The fiscal mess will remain as long as
the political bickering and name-calling that have
created stalemate continue.
Solution for a financial mess must be based on three
basic steps. We must make certain that government must
i


do only those things it should be doing, as well as make certa
that we are doing all those things we should be doing. We mus
establish the essentiality of every aspect of state government
operation. We must also make certain that we are operating ov
government in the most economical and efficient manner possibl
And we must provide adequate revenue on an equitable and econc
ically sould basis for the services we must finance. Unfortur
ly, most executive emphasis in past years has fallen completel
on only part of the third of these three aspects—the problem
more revenue. Michigan needs spending reform as well as rever
reform.
SWAINSON: I proposed to the legislature a program for fiscal reform whic
would have distributed our tax burden on the basis of the abil
to pay, would have given needed relief to industry and busines
and would have been of enormous assistance to our lower income
families. In essence this program would have eliminated the
Business Activities Tax, would have provided exemptions of mar
facturing machinery and equipment from personal property taxes
and would have eliminated the 4 per cent sales and use tax frc
drugs and food. To make up the revenue lost in doing this I
would have imposed a 3 per cent corporate and personal income
tax and a 5 per cent tax on financial institutions. I also
recommended a 1/2 per cent state tax on corporate and personal
income taxes for local units of government to relieve some of
the demands on the state treasury from these sources.
3. What kind, if any, of tax reform do you propose? What would be an
equitable tax program?
SWAINSON: I believe my answer to the previous question clearly outlines
what I consider to be the necessary tax reform program which
I believe to be equitable.
ROMNEY: Any tax reform program for Michigan—and one must be establish
if Michigan is to regain her rightful place among her sister
states—must embrace these features: It must provide relief
for job producers, it must provide relief for low-income famil
and it must make provisions for adequate financing of local
government operations. Essential to any tax reform program is
that the people of Michigan accept and understand both the nee
and the method by which reform can be accomplished.
4. What is your opinion of the proposed constitution?
ROMNEY:
Michigan voters should approve the new Constitution. It is
improved in every section over our present 54-year-old basic


state charter. The real question facing Michigan is
whether the new document is better than what we have.
The only factual honest answer to this is a very emphatic
"yes". Some of the outstanding features in the new
Constitution are improved apportionment, the strongest
and most comprehensive educational article in any state
constitution, an ideal civil rights provision including
a self-executing civil rights commission, stronger local
government including county home rule, more centralized
executive authority and responsibility in state govern-
ment, and many other features. Adoption of the new
Constitution would do more than any other single act to
help Michigan solve its problems.
SWAINSON: I have outlined nine points that I feel were badly treat-
ed in the recent constitutional convention. These do not,
by any means, cover all the bad elements of the proposed
new constitution but in themselves they provide a more
than adequate reason for opposing the work of the conven-
tion. Behind the bright label of the proposed new con-
stitution is the shabbiest product, mocking the public
trust and compromising principle, that I have ever seen.
The taxpayers of Michigan were shortchanged on their $2
million investment.
1. The proposed document would establish a hodge-
podge system of selection of state officials which
is unbelievably topped by a four-member, supposedly
bi-partisan, board to run our highway program. The
right of election of all public officials in posi-
tions of great public trust should be retained.
2. The proposed constitution builds in red tape
and roadblocks on appeals from administrative deci-
sions.
3. The proposed civil service article is a step
backward in opening the doors to political manipula-
tion.
4. The proposed finance and taxation article is a
crab-walk dance rather than a straight forward approacl
to the problems facing the state as outlined in the
first two questions. It makes no progress in providin;
for fiscal flexibility needed to run a state govern-
ment.


5. Self executing home rule for counties is denied. I
strongly support the principle advanced by such Republican
con con delegates as Dorothy Judd but defeated by the now
infamous political deal between the mossback wing of the
Republican party and the power hungry lip-service moderates
6. The proposed judicial article would eliminate the tra'
ditional right of the governor to make judicial appointment!
7. The proposed apportionment article is an abomination
which would perpetuate the unequitable situation now existii
I can settle for nothing less than the principle of one man,
one vote. 1 can't accept the vote of tree stumps and swamps
as counting for more than a human being.
8. The proposed civil rights provisions are a half measur
apparently designed to delude. An automatic appropriations
a civil rights commission which should have the authority to
pursue its decisions through legal approaches should be writ
into the constitution.
9. Related to the last point but in the area of broad hum
rights, I find the proposed search and seizure article froug
with legal uncertainty. Language which appears to be in con-
flict with the most recent decisions of the United States
Supreme Court should be removed.
5. Please comment on the often heard statement, The Democratic Party in
Michigan is labor dominated while the Republican Party is business
dominated.
SWAINSON: Fir3t on the question of labor domination of the Democratic Part
it should be pointed out clearly that labor organizations are on
a few of the many organizations which support the principles and
programs of the Democratic Party. I have not always agreed with
the state AFL-CIO positions, and labor has occasionally disagree
with my positions. This is the democratic system at work. Rega
ing the Republican Party, most of the charges of business domina
tion of the party seem to come from within the party itself. I
think political parties should be responsive to people, not as
representatives of organizations but as individuals and I think
the Democratic party and its programs are just that, the people*:
party and the programs which meet the needs of the people.


ROMNEY: There is little question but that the Democratic party
in Michigan is unduly dominated by a handful of union
political officials. This is the cause of special inter-
est government, to which I referred earlier. I do not
believe the Democratic party is unduly dominated by the
members of the Unions, but rather by a few skillful union
politicians. The Republican party in Michigan in past
years has been unduly dominated by a few corporations;
this is not true today. In fact, such unhealthy business
domination in the Republican party was largely responsible
for the expected re-action by union political officials
and their ascendancy to undue power in the Democratic
party. The Republican party in Michigan today is on its
way to becoming a genuine citizens party, with control and
direction resting with its citizen members. 1 favor two
strong parties, both responsible to citizen support, con-
trol, and direction. The Republican party in Michigan is
driving toward that goal today; the Democratic party i9
not, but I sincerely hope that it will in the future.
6. The lack of confidence in the State and the unemployment situa-
tion seem to go hand in hand. What can be done to remedy this?
ROMNEY: The best thing that could happen to Michigan in its fight
to restore confidence in our state would be a change in
leadership. Michigan is known as the problem state and
is cited as the horrible example that other states don*t
want to be like. All of what is said about Michigan is
not true; Michigan has tremendous physical assets. But in
terms of what people will do at any particular time, what
people think is more important than the facts. We must
improve Michigan*s reputation by new leadership that will
end special-interest government and petty partisan bicker-
ing before Michigan can prosper as we must prosper. It
takes $11,000 on the national average to create one job.
Job producers simply will not come into Michigan, if they
have a choice, unless they have confidence that they will
get fair treatment here. They also want to know that theii
tax burden will not be higher than it is in other compara-
ble states—such as the case is at present—and that they
will pay their fair share of government costs, but not
more than their fair share. These changes must be made to
get Michigan rolling again.


SWAINSON: Action by Democratic administrations in both the state and
federal level has done much to reduce unemployment. The con-
stant discussion of our supposed bad business climate by Repub-
licans is the greatest disservice I can imagine. It has an
adverse effect on the programs we have vigorously pursued to
increase employment and job opportunities. We will continue to
push our programs forward aggressively but it would be much
easier if we didn't have to fight the Republicans who seem
determined to smear the state's good name.
7. The appropriations to Michigan's state universities have not kept pace
with its educational needs, resulting in the loss of faculty, and the
rejection of qualified students. This has further precipitated a lack
of confidence in Michigan. Hot-; important is this need, and do you plai
to improve this situation?
SWAINSON: I have a long record of fighting for greater appropriations for
our colleges and universities. Education is the seedbed from
which we will reap progress. We desperately need increased appi
priations for education. The Republican dominated legislature,
controlled by the mossback wing of the GOP, has repeatedly re-
fused to meet our needs in this area. With the retirement and
defeat of some of these mossbacks there is hope that we can move
forward now with the programs the Democratic party has advocated
for many years.
ROMNEY: The need for adequate university facilities and adequate appro-
priations to retain valued faculty is one of our paramount unmet
needs. It is one of the reasons I am running for public office.
The costs of education to the state will continue to rise in the
future, as the need mounts. To meet these present and future
needs, Michigan has got to get straightened out. Adequate sup-
port for higher education is tied importantly to our state's
economic growth; when our economy is healthy again and matching
our growth in population then our universities can be assured
of adequate financial support. And our universities are one of
Michigan's greatest assets. Taking advantage of these education
assets through adequate support, proper promotion and realistic
development will be one step in restoring our state to its role
as dynamic, progressive, mighty Michigan.
i


8. How do you foresee the future of Michigan? How can this be
achieved?
ROMNEY: The future of Michigan, to a great extent, depends upon
what the people of this state want. The people will
make their wishes known in November. We have all the
assets in Michigan to be once again dynamic mighty
Michigan; but one asset that is missing is a sound
reputation. The people of Michigan can take the first
big step toward restoring our state's reputation in
November by telling the nation that we are determined
to put our home in order with a fresh new approach.
The people can take the second big step toward recovery
next April by approving the new Constitution and telling
the world that Michigan is not the problem state, but
rather the problem solving state. The future of Michigar
quite literally rests in the hands of our people.
SWAINSON: Michigan has the greatest potential of any state in the
nation. Our still vast natural resources and our
choice location in the middle of the nation but on the
fourth sea coast make Michigan a most desirable place
for industry. Our scenic beauty and our programs for
the people's health, education and general welfare make
Michigan a most desirable place for individuals. The
Democratic Party in Michigan has advocated programs
which would assure economic growth. We welcome every-
one's cooperation in carrying these programs forward.
Unfortunately, despite claims to the contrary, the
Republican Party has resisted these programs.



VISIBLE-LIGHT LASER
The first visible-light continuous wave
laser for commercial use was recently
put on the market. A laser is a device
that can produce a beam of light hav-
ing a constant frequency and no varia-
tion in phase angle. Ordinary light is
composed of a wide range of frequen-
cies, each of which continuously varies in
phase angle. This particular laser will
emit a continuous bright red beam of
coherent light at a wave length of 6328
angstroms. The unit is expected to find
use in the development of new optical
communication techniques, in perform-
ance analysis of optical systems and in
high speed optical recording of data
for computer systems. If you are inter-
ested in purchasing one of these units
the price is only $7900. The unit was
developed by a joint effort of both the
Perkin-Elmer Corporation of Norwalk,
Connecticut and the Spectra-Physics
Company of Mountainview, California.
CYCLOTRON COILS
Creating an interesting picture are 6
of the 24 focusing magnet coils which
will be used in an 83-inch cyclotron
being built here at the University. Each
is wound with a 0.468 inch square cop-
per conductor that contains a 0.230
inch diameter hole for water cooling.
Each coil weighs about 500 pounds and
is I inch thick, 2 feet long and 13 V2
feet along its arc. When installed in the
cyclotron the coils will be used for en-
ergizing two focusing magnets that will
guide a particle from the cyclotron to
the target area. The coils are being
built by the Allis Chalmers Manufac-
turing Company.

HAVE FOUND IT! (Continued from page IS)
the rapacious invader, out there do-
ing his manly duty. Duty nothing.
Suppose, as so many of us are, he had
been a Falastaff, asking himself "What
is honor?" and answering himself,
"Air . . . Then I'll none of it ... ."
The survival of the species could not
be left to the decision or volition of
that one or of any other one. For the
species to survive, it had to be de-
fended by males who did not wait for
the prompting of duty nor for the
weighing of values, who did not stop
to catechise, as Falstaft was doing,
but fought because they liked to fight.
The luxury of the twentieth century
may have produced a large number
of physical cowards, and custom may
have suppressed their characteristic
belligerence, but the urge remains and
it will be satisfied deviously or di-
rectly.
4. Related Installations. Just a
quick appraisal, and then this report
will be ended. There are not many
examples available for study, because
most societies just grew. Two promi-
nent examples, however, were delib-
erately launched on grand scales, each
rather completely schemed with long-
range plans of operation, but found-
ed on entirely different principles.
Fundamentally, utopianism must
never doubt that man is innately
good, that his superficial deficiencies
are perfectible, and furthermore that
his evil acts come not from any tend-
ency within himself but simply from
the institutions in and through which
he lives. It is not only because of the
authority of Marxist doctrine that it
is necessary to adhere to this belief;
it is plain that any admission to the
contrary would bring down the whole
scaffold in a logical wreck. If this be-
lief is true, on the other hand, then
the road to Utopia is fairly short, sim-
ply a matter of changing institutions,
of re-educating the masses, and, natur-
ally, of eliminating the small percent-
age (about one quarter) who are
intractable. It may be that from
generation to generation a few throw-
backs will be born who do not
cooperate, but the number will gradu-
ally play out asymptotically because
they will not be retained to repro-
duce, while the improved environ-
ment will result, in desirable genes in
the breeding stock.
Another danger to utopianism, un-
recognized at present by our local
Utopians, is the inability of men to
foresee the effect of technological dis-
covery. When Gottlieb Daimler built
his light-weight internal combustion
engine, certainly no man in the world
could have any idea what the social
outgrowth would be. Here at our
university we have built a laser and
are bouncing light rays off the moon.
Perhaps in a hundred years they will
look back at us with amusement be-
cause we could not see the implica-
tions of this device. Who knows?
The United States of America was
planned initially on the principle
that the human race is as good now
as it will ever be; though no worse,
it will not become better through
any intrinsic force. No intention of
founding a Utopia was entertained,
and it has not turned out to be one,
but we may get some idea of its rela-
tive blessings by asking John Chaca-
poulis at the restaurant, or Mike
Bocco on the farm, or Moise Levin at
the store. All of them came here re-
cently, and voluntarily.
Implicit in this simple system is
the principle that the only workable
scheme which man is wise enough to
design for himself is a structure like
a warehouse with moveable parti-
tions which may be shifted to suit the
need; that administrators not only
will not be very wise, they certainly
will not be wise enough to choose
their successors, and must be held in
suspicion at all limes; that the use-
fulness of man's institutions, or the
injustice they produce, changes from
year to year and from place to place.
Above all, there has been a be-
lief in this country that there dwells
an intrinsic good in change itself.
Anything new is bound to be better.
Yankee ingenuity became an accepted
term in the language. Our whole
structure was planned so that change
could occur easily, without violence
and without fracture, without dam-
ming the tides of destiny until the
levees burst. A French savant has said
to the effect that no matter how
worthy a proposed change, destiny
would always provide those to play
the role of antagonists. Destiny has
provided them in America, but our
civilization had such elasticity that
history could How around them and
leave the mossbacks isolated, as our
Mississippi cuts a new channel around
a sand bar and flows on with never
a stop. We know that if we forbid the
river to go around, the result is sure
disaster.
We have determined Utopians here
who do not know that we have made
one of man's most magnificent dis-
coveries, a discovery as valuable as
that which Pythagoras celebrated by
sacrificing a hundred oxen. We al-
ready have an agricultural dilemma
which we cannot change, which only
leads us into further labyrinths where
our only resource is further control.
We are uncovering new "national
problems" every day, and we all
agree that something ought to be
done about them, but there is no so-
lution except to turn the whole job
over to the planners in the Federal
government, where Parkinson's law
takes over. Our national debt grows
year by year, just as our bureaucracy
does, and year by year our freedom to
change becomes more restricted.
No man in America believes that
it will ever go the other way.
Though the end of freedom, of the
fundamental freedom, the freedom
to change, is not far away, let us at
least be proud of the place we shall
enjoy in history. Alter all the "isms"
and the Utopias have waxed and
failed, some robust people shall es-
tablish themselves again, and beside
their constitution, as a separate Bill
of Rights, they shall write, "The
fundamental and vital freedom is the
freedom to change." A thousand years
hence people will know us by our
great discovery. Perhaps then they
will earnestly try to use it. All will
agree that if ever in history there was
a nation which ought to have sur-
vived, it was this one.
Perhaps by that time Syracuse will
be so far away that they will confuse
Archimedes with another old man at
a later date, and report that he ran
ecstatically down the corridors of the
Time &amp; Life Building, shouting.
"Eureka! Eureka! 1 have found it! I
have found it!"
His name was John Davenport.*
Nobody paid any attention to him.
It was already too late.
* Several years ago Mr. Davenport, an
editor of Fortune, explored this principle in a
series of superb articles, which I think have
been published as a book, recommended to
every American who would like to understand
his country better. Freedom to change is the
secret of our strength, but few know it.

2000 mph airliner...another engineering challenge!
On the drawing boards of aircraft
engineers, plans are taking shape
for a supersonic passenger jet —
one that will fly from New York
to London in just over 2 hours, at
Mach-3 speeds of 2000 m.p.h. or
more. The delta-shaped transport,
flying at altitudes up to 80,000
feet, would make today's fastest
airliners seem as pokey as stage-
coaches. And what size! Perhaps
two hundred feet from nose to
tail. Three stories tall.
Through the intensive research
of the metallurgical engineer will
come a metal for the skin of this
mighty airliner. One that will be
able to withstand critically high
temperatures — up to 630°F —
caused by supersonic speeds.
Challenging? An engineering
career, such as metallurgy, is full
of challenges. Whether it's excit-
ing, new designs for a supersonic
airliner, a gas-turbined car, a
nuclear-powered ship, you'll be at
work in a stimulating profession
— one with room for advancement
— one that promotes progress and
economic growth.

HOW CUTLER-HAMMER
CREATIVE ENGINEERING
HELPS INDUSTRY REACH
ITS AUTOMATION GOALS
Ralph Millermaster, vice president,
engineering and development, answers the questions
most frequently asked by students regarding
Cutler-Hammer's role in industrial automation
Q. How long has Cutler-Hammer
been in Automation?
A. Long before the word "auto-
mation" was coined.
Many company historians view
the installation of the first electric
turret-turning control for battle-
ships as our original "automatic
system" achievement. In 1904,
trials aboard the U.S.S. INDIANA
so improved rapid-fire and gunnery-
control scoring that identical sys-
tems were installed on sister ships.
Q. How does your Automation—
or "System Control"—effort
differ from your other control
business?
A. We work in two areas of control.
One involves research, develop-
ment and manufacture of stand-
ardized electric control components
and apparatus. Here the customer
orders from us through a bill of
material.
The automation customer is dif-
ferent. He has no bill of material
—he has a problem. He needs to
improve production or quality, or
to reduce his unit costs. He isn't
buying "hardware," he's seeking a
creative solution to a challenging
problem . . . and that's what our
engineers provide.
Q. Assuming I decide to work
for a control manufacturer, why
Cutler-Hammer?
A. The most compelling reason is
our continuing interest and exten-
sive experience in "System Con-
trol." This is the life of our com-
pany and distinct career advantages
result from this concern.
Our engineers are forced to apply
a combination of advanced elec-
tronic and electrical engineering
know-how to solve a customer's
manufacturing problem. They start
with a thorough grounding in the
customer's products — how he
moves and works the materials he
manufactures. Then they apply
their technical knowledge to create
a practical solution. We have a
Materials Handling group, a Metal
Processing group, and many other
industry groups composed of young,
creative-minded engineers.
And, we don't "stock-pile" our
engineering talent. Every engineer
we hire is expected to contribute
quickly and directly to the team
effort.
Q. How does Cutler-Hammer
approach an automation job?
A. We have learned that a sizable
system needs painstaking coordi-
nation between many groups—
project teams, engineering, mainte-
nance and purchasing personnel at
the customer factory and head-
quarters locations . . . machinery
builders, motor manufacturers,
contractors and many more.
We view this coordination as one
of our primary functions, and fulfill
it by furnishing all responsible
groups and individuals the infor-
mation they want and need to
guarantee an efficient dovetailing
of effort.
We organize a coordinating task
force for each project, headed by a
lead engineer and staffed by engi-
neers representing every necessary
technical discipline. That task force
is charged with three duties:
WHATS NEW FOR YOU? ASK...
1. Create a system that will
solve the problem.
2. Design the system within the
time allotted.
3. Install the system at a cost
which pays its way for the
customer and provides us a
fair profit.
Task forces work together in a
modern 500,000 square foot plant
specifically designed to house every
activity involved in the evolution
of the complete system. Every pos-
sible step has been taken to provide
a climate that is conducive to
creative planning and development.
This approach has paid off! Long
recognized as a leader in standard-
ized motor control, Cutler-Hammer
is more and more being regarded
as a major contributor in industrial
automation. Our automation cre-
dentials include innovations in every
industrial field from continuous
process lines to newspaper mail
rooms.
Q. How do I learn more about
Cutler-Hammer's automation
capability and the career op-
portunities for engineers?
A. By visiting your Place-
ment Office . . . picking up the
Cutler-Hammer literature on the
rack, and talking to your Placement
Director. Or, you can write direct
to T. B. Jochem, Cutler-Hammer,
Milwaukee, Wisconsin, for a com-
plete kit of information. And, I
hope that you will plan to meet
with our representative when he
visits your campus.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC



How to get the
most out of a
job interview:
Every company that interviews col-
lege students is interested in hiring
students with high potential. But
matching the right man with the right
company is a complex assignment.
How can you know which company
you should join? You can't know for
sure, but you can get a reasonably
accurate indication if you make the
most of your campus interview. Be-
low are a few suggestions to assist you
in making such an interview with
Koppers more worthwhile and produc-
tive for you.
aBefore the interview, stop in
your Placement Office and re-
view in some detail the literature
explaining Koppers diversified line
of products and services. Become
familiar with Koppers eight operat-
ing divisions and the particular con-
tribution each makes to industry.
jol Try to determine as specifically
I—I as you can the type of work
that seems to interest you most.
Then question the interviewer as to
how that type of work fits into
Koppers many activities. If, like
many graduates, you find that your
interests cover many areas of work,
tell the interviewer. You'll find that
he will understand your problem
and may be of help in deciding on
the kind of "Koppers opportunity"
for which you would be best suited.
HBe prepared to outline your
accomplishments. He will be in-
terested in your extra-curricular ac-
tivities as well as your scholastic
achievement. Point out any part-
time or summer experience which
you may have had. If you can effec-
tively communicate to the inter-
viewer your background and inter-
ests, both you and he will be better
able to decide whether or not this
is the right opportunity for you.
BReview with the interviewer
Koppers on-the-job training
program. This program is designed
to allow you to make an immediate
and recognizable contribution. You
go to work—you don't return to the
classroom for training. You will be
working on projects that will permit
you to apply the knowledge you have
gained through your college training,
while at the same time you will be
furthering your knowledge and un-
derstanding of your field.
|g I Ask the interviewer about job
I—I location, military policy, educa-
tional assistance policy, and any
other questions which you may have
about the Company. He will be
happy to provide any information he
can to assist you in getting the most
from your Koppers interview.
If the possibility of a career with Koppers interests you, contact your Placement Office
and arrange to see the Koppers representative on his next visit to your campus.

AND RESEARCH
by Michael Gordon

DRIVEOMETER
"Driveometer," is the name given
an electronic device to be used as an
aid in driver training programs. The
driveometer was developed here at
the University by Dr. Bruce C. Green-
shields, assistant director of the U-M
Transportation Institute. The instru-
ment is the result of several years of
research spent by Dr. Greenshields on
traffic flow and driver behavior.
The driveometer counts the num-
ber of actions a driver makes in oper-
ating the steering wheel, accelerator
and brakes, producing a purely ob-
jective report of the driver's motions.
This is in contrast with the subjec-
tive or personal reports previously
given by the instructor.
Dr. Greenshields points out that
the experienced drivers tend to tra-
verse a course with fewer motions
than do high accident drivers. Also,
beginning drivers, who quickly be-
come oblivious to the instrument,
look at its report as an unbiased indi-
cation of their progress. People seem
to regard the driveometer result as
more accurate and less personal than
the report made by the instructor.
The driveometer will record a
steering wheel movement of three-
eights of an inch and an accelerator
movement of one-quarter of an inch.
Brake pedal movements are recorded
each time the brake pedal is depressed
enough to make the tail lights go on.
The development of the driveo-
meter has been sponsored by die Na-
tional Institute of Health and the
Ford Motor Company Fund.

"Driveometer" installed in a car and ready to help train new drivers.
NEW PROGRAM FOR ENGINEERS
A new combined degree program
is being offered for the first time this
fall to students in naval architecture
and aeronautical engineering. By
completing one semester beyond that
now required for a single degree, stu-
dents will be able to obtain Bachelor
of Science in Engineering degrees in
both naval architecture and aeronau-
tical engineering.
The program was established be-
cause of the growing interest by both
industry and government in the de-
sign and manufacture of the hydrofoil
and ground effect vehicles. A hydro-
foil is a craft that moves through the
water at high speeds on underwater
wings, while a ground effect machine
is a vehicle that moves over the
ground on a cushion of air which it
creates itself.
It is believed that most students
entering this new combined degree
program will seek advanced degrees
in one field or the other.
OCTOPUS
A machine resembling an octopus,
which is to test the wearing character-
istics of materials used in the serving
of food, has been installed in the
School of Public Health. The ma-
chine contains eight stations where
various operations, such as heating,
freezing, soiling and cutting are done.
Sample materials such as aluminum,
glass and plastic are mounted on each

Breakaway acceleration from 0 to 60 mph in just a fraction
over 8 seconds. That is the unheard of big car performance
achieved with small car economy by a popular 1962 auto-
mobile turbocharged by Garrett-AiResearch.
The Garrett turbocharger is the first controlled for opti-
mum performance at all driving speeds. No matter how fast
or slow you may be traveling, sudden acceleration and extra
pulling power are there instantly and smoothly when you
need them — on any grade at any altitude.
How is it possible? The Garrett turbocharger, driven
entirely by the engine's waste exhaust gases, sucks in larger
amounts of outside air and forces maximum fuel-air
charges into the cylinders. This means better combustion,
more power.
Other areas of concentration at Garrett include: space
life support systems, solar and nuclear power systems,
electronic systems, air conditioning and pressurization
systems, computer systems and small gas turbines for both
military and industrial uses.

tion of the column continually shifts
the samples from one location to an-
other. The octopus is also capable of
scraping and washing dishes.
The machine represents the first
step in a larger project in which re-
searchers hope to:
• Determine a way to measure the
"Cleanability" of different materi-
als and surfaces.
• Develop a reliable "use and wear"
test on such materials as aluminum,
stainless steel, porcelain, plastic,
glass and china.
• And ultimately, help set health
standards for the use of dishes and
kitchenware in homes and restau-
rants.
Radioactive tracers will be used to
determine what effect wear-and-tear
have on the ability to keep materials
clean, whether disease germs might
hide themselves in cracks and scars,
and what health hazards are created
by the normal use of a material.
The creation of the "Octopus" was
carried out by the National Sanitation
Foundation, NSF testing laboratory
staff. Working with the NSF is an ad-
visory committee representing manu-
facturers, trade associations, the armed

ANECHOIC
The Institute of Science and Tech-
nology has built an extremely strange
looking laboratory at the University's
Willow Run Airport. The laboratory,
shown in the adjoining picture is
called a microwave anechoic (an-ek-
ko-ic) or a non-echo chamber. The
laboratory will be used to assist in
making ultra-sensitive radar measure-
ments under conditions that simulate
free space. This is possible because
the interior of the laboratory is free
from interference caused by the
earth's surface and by electrical equip-
ment.
The walls, ceiling and floor of this
odd looking room are covered with
clusters of sponge-rubber spikes and
large pads of specially treated plastic.
This material absorbs microwave
energy so fast that virtually no energy
is able to reflect from the room's sur-
faces. As a result the sensitive instru-
ments in the room can operate under
practically interference free condi-
tions.
Tests on this new chamber have not
been completed yet. However, it is be-
lieved that microwave echos and
other interference in the room will be
one million times smaller than in an
ordinary, steel reinforced room.
The anechoic chamber will be used
to test special radar transmitters and
receivers, and measure precisely the
radar reflection from objects of vari-
ous sizes, shapes and materials. It will
also be used to measure antenna pat-
terns and the coupling effects between
transmitting and receiving antennas.
The frequencies used by the equip-
ment under test in the room will
range from 500 megacycles to 50,000
megacycles. This range includes al-
most all radar frequencies.

Another method of manipulating
learning is to alter "avoidance" con-
ditioning. Ten seconds after a buzzer
is sounded, a shock is administered
until the rat turns it off by turning a
wheel. When a stimulating drug is
administered, learning seems to im-
prove; however the possibility exists
that this may be emotional and fur-
ther work must be done.
There are many variables in learn-
ing experiments which interfere with
and distort results. One major prob-
lem is differences in the native ability
of the animals. One way to control
enon he is interested in before he can
begin to understand and explain it.
The above experiments are the begin-
nings of isolating, manipulating, and
eventually understanding learning.
Physiological-Psychological Correlation
Another area of interest to Dr.
Rothchild is the correlation between
physiological and psychological
events. One convenient approach to
this is taste preference correlation.
A rat who has been deprived of
common salt (NaCl) is given a choice
psychosis). He must, however, con-
tinue to take the LiCl solution in
order to remain normal. The mechan-
ism of this operation is of extreme
interest. It is thought that the lithium
replaces sodium or potassium.
Attempts to further investigate this
involve measuring a rat's preference
for potassium chloride or sodium
chloride before and after administer-
ing lithium chloride, sodium chloride
freference seems to be unaffected, but
potassium chloride preference seems
to increase. Another object of this ex-
perimentation is to try to find some

Thomas J. Chamberlain, research assistant at Mental Health Re-
search Institute, adjusts D.C. electrodes used in recording electro-
physiological changes resulting from learning in the nervous
system of rats.

brain, is being used at Mental Health Research Institute
in an experiment on dreams.
for this is to condition the individual
limbs of starfish which are indepen-
dent. Each limb is genetically identi-
cal and therefore, also identical in
ability.
Since nervous systems are basically
similar, these techniques can, with
certain reservations, be applied to
higher animals (monkeys, for in-
stance) and humans. Even in humans,
the learning process can be isolated
by splitting the brain. Then, the
spinal cord goes through a process
which is similar to learning. That is,
it "learns" that the brain has been
split.
In any scientific research, one must
isolate and manipulate the phenom-
of solutions of varying concentration.
It has been found that the rat will
choose the correct concentration to
restore the proper amount of salt to
his body. How he knows this, is an
extremely interesting question.
Experimentation along these lines
has also found applications in hu-
mans. This concerns lithium chloride,
which is similar to sodium chloride. If
a normal man drinks a LiCl solution,
his body will soon excrete it in the
urine (LiCl poisoning can also occur
if large enough quantities are used).
However, if a manic psychotic drinks
the same solution, his body holds it
for four days, then excretes it and the
psychotic becomes normal (loses his
way of treating lithium chloride pois-
oning.
THE PSI APPARATUS
One area that should be of par-
ticular interest to engineers is prob-
lem solving: how does an individual
attack and solve a problem? We
talked with Dr. John Gyr who is
working with the PSI apparatus,
more formally known as the Problem
Solving with Information experiment-
al apparatus. The purpose of the

anism which various individuals use
to solve problems.
The apparatus consists of a number
of lights arranged in a circle with
another light in the center. Each light,
in some way, governs the behavior of
one or more of the other lights
(i.e. whether they can be turned on
or off). There is a sequential arrange-
ment, so that each light must be oper-
ated in succession, with the ultimate
goal being to turn on the light in the
center.
One light may have the following
influences on another: It may be a
necessary and sufficient condition to
light the next one. It may be a partial
condition (1) in combination with
other lights it will light the next one
in the sequence (1). It may be in-
hibitory (1), it may block the way
for other lights (1).
In operation, the individual is given
a scheme that shows which lights are
related, but not how they are related.
By a process of trial and error, learn-
ing, and reasoning the individual is
supposed to arrive at the correct se-
quence that lights the center light.
Attempts are being made to con-
struct a model for learning using the
PSI apparatus to simulate life situa-
tions with certain simplifications (i.e.,
emotion, health, and other biases are
removed). Knowing how a subject
will accept the machine's response
and observing the subject's response,
gives one a basis for predicting the
subject's response under similar con-
ditions. Of course, the model is a
function of the parameters involved
and it is not valid to generalize com-
pletely to situations involving other
parameters.
Current work being done by Dr.
Gyr involves the testing of precon-
ceived models. A model is constructed
that predicts how a subject should
behave on the PSI apparatus. The
subject is then tested and his reactions
are compared with the models predic-
tions. Corrections in the model are
made on this basis. Using this meth-
od, learning models are getting more
and more accurate in the ability to
predict. This doesn't guarantee that
the models are actual representations
of the problem solving procedure, but
it is a definite step in unraveling the
underlying process.
Present models of the PSI are also
being used to study problem solving
under conditions such as fatigue and
influence, but the range of situations
which are analogous to life are lim-
ited. Man-made games, logical prob-
lems, and scientific and engineering
problems make up the bulk of the
machines testing repertory.
The Psychological Corporation has
used the PSI to test individuals and
attempts to predict their potential for
various occupations such as engineer-
ing, mathematics, and medicine. Early
indications are that the PSI can be
quite successful in its predictions.
Somewhat removed from the field
of experimental psychology, is the

Electronic axons. These electronic de-
vices will be used to simulate the oper-
ation of an axon to test hypotheses
and, perhaps, to gain new knowledge.
application of mathematics to psycho-
logical research. For this, we talked
to Dr. A. Rappaport, one of the
country's leading authorities on game
theory, mathematical psychology, and
probability. Rather than try to ex-
plain the internal factors governing
behavior, Dr. Rappaport attempts to
predict behavior on a statistical basis.
The December issue of the Technic
will feature an article on this subject.
Though the above hardly scratches
the surface as far as particular experi-
ments and their details, it does illus-
trate a few of the varied approaches
to unraveling the mystery of behavior.
The future seems to hold, for experi-
mental psychology, as much promise
as it does for any of the other rapidly
expanding technological and scientific
fields.
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Chemical Engineering
Chemical Engineering was Inaugurated at the University In 1897 with the appointment of A. H. White as Instructor of Chemical Technology.
The following year Michigan became the second university to offer a course of study leading to the B.S. degree in Chemical Engineering. The
first class graduated in 1903 with 5 members. In 1914, 33 B.S., I M.S., and 4 Ph.D. degrees were granted. That year the present department was
organized with A. H. White as its chairman. For almost the next 30 years White guided the department to a position of national and international
recognition. At his retirement in 1943, there were 20 full-time faculty members and over 300 students in the department. G. G. Brown succeeded
White and served until 1951 when he became Dean of the College. He was followed by D. L Katz, who served until this year when S. W.
Churchill took over as chairman. The department at this time is comprised of 30 faculty members, 200 undergraduates and 135 graduate
students.
The training of a chemical engineer is designed to cope with the rapid change that is talcing place in modern engineering. Great emphasis
is placed on developing a sound scientific background, particularity in chemistry, mathematics, and physics. If there is anything which distinguishes
the chemical engineer from engineers in other disciplines, it is his knowledge and practice of the principles of chemistry. For this reason physical
chemistry is now taken early so that chemical engineering courses may be built upon it. This is also true of mathematics and physics and even an
electric computer course. The engineering sciences such as mechanics, materials, thermodynamics, and electronics come in during the inter-
mediate years, and professional chemical engineering subjects are taken near the end. The program is so arranged that nearly half of it is
constituted of elective courses. This permits each student to plan a program which is best suited to his individual objectives.
Traditionally, chemical engineering has led all the engineering fields in the proportion of students who take advanced training to further
progress in the field. Do not take chemical engineering if you prefer a field that is calm and stagnant. If you want a dynamic field and if you like
chemistry along with physics and mathematics, check with the program adviser in chemical engineering. He will gladly introduce you to this area of
professional work where the job opportunities are literally unlimited.

DEEP-STRENGTH {Asphalt-Base) pavement
With today's "giant step forward" in pavement engineering—
DEEP-STRENGTH (Asphalt-Base) pavement—there is need for
engineers with a solid background in the fundamentals of
Asphalt technology and pavement construction.
Because new DEEP-STRENGTH Asphalt-base
construction provides the most durable, most
economical pavement modern engineering science
has developed, Interstate and primary superhigh-
ways in all parts of the country are being built with
advanced design DEEP-STRENGTH Asphalt pavement.
Already, more than 90% of America's paved roads and
streets are surfaced with Asphalt. And Asphalt pavements
have successfully kept America's wheels rolling since 1876.
Your contribution—and reward—in our nation's vast road-
building program can depend on your knowledge of modern
Asphalt technology. So, prepare for your future now. Write for
your free "Student Kit" about Asphalt technology.

SHOCK TUBES
oped: the electric discharge tube.
This tube depends not on two press-
ure regions, but instead a high voltage
discharge through a portion of the
test gas. When not in use, the tube is
evacuated, however, to fire the tube,
the gas to be studied is introduced
into the tube until a pressure of linm
is reached. Then a bank of capacitors
is discharged; the energy of the dis-
charge compresses the gas and cre-
ates the shock.
Instrumentation of this shock tube
is very similar to the pressure differen-
tial type. However, in the electric
tube, the shock is much taster, conse-
quently instrumentation must be
more refined. The electric tube is
used to study the same phenomena as
the pressure type luminous tube, ex-
cept that temperatures are on the
order of 50,000° to 100,000° K. there-
fore one may observe higher de-
grees of ionization.

marized the qualitative aspects of
shock tubery. Many subjects have

What makes hickory
the way it is

This photomicrograph shows the basic
structure of hickory wood. It was taken
on a plain, ordinary microscope with a
BROWNIE Camera. For details on this
use of BROWNIE Cameras, request a
copy of "Photomicrography with Simple
Cameras" from Eastman Kodak Com-
pany, Sales Service Division, Rochester
4, N.Y. Everybody knows what a
BROWNIE Camera is.

MAKING CHEAP THINGS WORK WELL IS A
GOOD LIFE.
Plenty of lively work at Kodak research-
ing, engineering, producing, and market-
ing all sorts of things.
Huntley with rope
May we please plant a little spore in
the brain intended to grow into a career
not previously contemplated?
Sound, businesslike outfits need well-
grounded engineers to run their photo-
graphic operations. This doesn't neces-
sarily mean making the candid shots at
the boss's daughter's wedding.
We have made a 42-minute movie
called "Photography at work ... a
progress report." (To show it, write
Eastman Kodak Company, Professional
Photographic Sales Division, Rochester
4, N.Y.)
Mr. Chet Huntley narrates. We take
you inside a cake being baked in Day-
ton. We puzzle you with a monstrous
camera intended to take pictures in
Cincinnati without perspective. We show
you how they test a new hydrofoil on
Lake Washington and what nooks and
crannies a camera can explore when
fitted with fiber optics. We take you to
lots of places, starting on a classy note
with the hunt for anti-matter at
Brookhaven.
If we create the impression that the
great linear accelerator there is nothing
but another camera accessory, do not
conclude that perspective is being
shunned in Rochester as well as in Cin-
cinnati. There is a "low technology"
that civilizations evolve over the mil-
lennia for hewing the wood and drawing
the water of everyday life and a "high
technology" that is called into existence
by the demands of pure science and
then very kindly lowers a rope to haul
up the "low technology". Maybe 1520
feet of movie film is better than rope.

SOPHISTICATED TECHNICAL PERSUASION IS A
GOOD LIFE.
The improvement of
capacitors
Our polyester is different from other
polyester. We add a cyclohexane ring to
the unit structure, whereas other poly-
ester isjust poly(ethylene terephthalate).
The added ring protects against moisture,
raises the melting point, and gives cus-
tomers some reasons of self-interest to
seek out the trademarks KODEL on
polyester fiber and TENITE on poly-
ester molding granules.
When the president of Kodak visited
the lab where, in addition, its electrical
advantages were discovered, we set up
ten .05-/^fd 200-v polyester capacitors
for him, identical except that five had
the ring and five didn't. We put them
all in an oven at 185°C and applied 700
volts of dc across them. Within 3 minutes
all five of the p(e t)'s had shorted out.
This was the logical moment for the
president to leave, but realism is com-
pany policy. The president wanted to
watch the first of ours fail. It took 10
minutes. That was four years ago.
We then replaced 15 of the regular
capacitors in a TV set with our kind and
set it to running 9 hours a day, 7 days
a week. All other components that
failed we replaced. For the Electrical
Insulation Show early this year, we
removed the set from the room where
the lab manager hides it and took it to
Washington. It was the hit of the show.
The coincidence that it happened to be
the only TV set in the hall on the day
when the first American was orbiting
the earth might have helped focus atten-
tion on it. It would not have been a
good place for a capacitor to blow.

An interview with General Electric's W. Scott Hill
Manager—Engineering Recruiting
One of a series .

How to Make the Most
of Your First Five Years

MR. HILL has managerial responsibility for General Electric's college recruiting activities
for engineers, scientists, PhD s and technicians for the engineering function of the
Company. Long active in technical personnel development within General Electric, he
also serves as vice president of the Engineers' Council for Professional Development,
board member of the Engineering Manpower Commission, director of the Engineering
Societies Personnel Service and as an officer or member of a variety of technical societies.
Q. Mr. Hill, I've heard that my first
five years in industry may be the most
critical of my career. Do you agree?
A. Definitely. It is during this stage
that you'll be sharpening your career
objectives, broadening your knowledge
and experience, finding your place in
professional practice and developing
work and study habits that you may
follow throughout your career. It's a
period fraught with challenge and op-
portunity—and possible pitfalls.
Recognizing the importance of this
period, the Engineers' Council for Pro-
fessional Development has published
an excellent kit of material for young
engineers. It is titled "Your First 5
Years." I would strongly recommend
you obtain a copy.*
Q. What can I do to make best use
of these important years?
A. First of all, be sure that the com-
pany you join provides ample opportun-
ity for professional development during
this critical phase of your career.
Then, develop a planned, organized
personal development program—tai-
lored to your own strengths, weaknesses
and aspirations—to make the most of
these opportunities. This, of course,
calls for a critical self appraisal, and
periodic reappraisals. You will find an
extremely useful guide for this pur-
pose in the "First 5 Years" kit I just
mentioned.
Q. How does General Electric en-
courage self development during this
period?
A. In many ways. Because we recog-
nize professional self-development as a
never-ending process, we encourage
technical employees to continue their
education not only during their early
years but throughout their careers.
We do this through a variety of pro-
grams and incentives. General Electric's
Tuition Refund Program, for example,
provides up to 100% reimbursement for
tuition and fees incurred for graduate
study. Another enables the selected
graduate with proper qualifications to
obtain a master's degree, tuition free,
while earning up to 75% of his full-
time salary. These programs are sup-
plemented by a wide range of techni-
cal and nontechnical in-plant courses
conducted at the graduate level by
recognized Company experts.
Frequent personal appraisals and en-
couragement for participation in pro-
fessional societies are still other ways
in which G.E. assists professional em-
ployees to develop their full potential.
Q. What about training programs?
Just how valuable are they to the
young engineer?
A. Quite valuable, generally. But there
are exceptions. Many seniors and grad-
uate students, for example, already have
clearly defined career goals and profes-
sional interests and demonstrated abili-
ties in a specific field. In such cases,
direct placement in a specific position
may be the better alternative.
Training programs, on the other
hand, provide the opportunity to gain
valuable on-the-job experience in sev-
eral fields while broadening your base
of knowledge through related course
study. This kind of training enables
you to bring your career objectives in-
to sharp focus and provides a solid
foundation for your development, wheth-
er your interests tend toward speciali-
zation or management. This is par-
ticularly true in a highly diversified
company like General Electric where
young technical graduates are exposed
to many facets of engineering and to
a variety of product areas.
Q. What types of training programs
does your company offer, Mr. Hill?
A. General Electric conducts a num-
ber of them. Those attracting the ma-
jority of technical graduates are the
Engineering and Science, Technical
Marketing and Manufacturing Train-
ing Programs. Each includes on-the-job
experience on full-time rotating assign-
ments supplemented by a formal study
curriculum.
Q. You mentioned professional so-
cieties. Do you feel there is any ad-
vantage in joining early in your career?
A. I do indeed. In fact, I would rec-
ommend you join a student chapter on
your campus now if you haven't already-
done so.
Professional societies offer the young
engineer many opportunities to expand
his fund of knowledge through associa-
tion with leaders in his profession,
to gain recognition in his field, and to
make a real contribution to his profes-
sion. Because General Electric benefits
directly, the Company often helps de-
fray expenses incurred by professional
employees engaged in the activities of
these organizations.
Q. Is there anything I can do now to
better prepare myself for the transition
from college campus to industry?
A. There are many things, naturally,
most of which you are already doing
in the course of your education.
But there is one important area you
nay be overlooking. I would suggest
you recognize now that your job—
whatever it is—is going to be made
easier by the ability to communicate
. . . effectively. Learn to sell yourself
and your ideas. Our own experience at
General Electric—and industry-wide sur-
veys as well—indicates that the lack
of this ability can be one of the major
shortcomings of young technical grad-
uates.

lished by the Engineers' Council for
Professional Development, normally
sells for $2.00. While our limited sup-
ply lasts, however, you may obtain a

power. But the "If is a big one. It means,
among other things, building a container to hold 100-million degree
temperatures ... hot enough to vaporize any known material.
Theoretically, this container problem could be solved by holding
the hydrogen reaction Inside a powerful magnetic field, a sort
of "magnetic bottle." Bui such a magnetic bottle would require
a series of huge costly magnets consuming a powerhouse
full of electricity. However, Westinghouse is already marketing a fist-sized
super conducting magnet that runs on virtually no power, yet
produces a field twice as intense as a conventional magnet
weighing 20 tons. Scientists believe that future developments
of these super magnets may provide the answer to the problem
of harnessing the energy of a hydrogen reaction. Perhaps you would be

250,000 rpm/-452°P
Miniature turboexpander permits major breakthrough
in cryogenics.. .Temperatures ranging from —200°F to
—452°F are achieved by converting gases such as helium
and nitrogen into a liquid state.
When cryogenic liquids circulate over an object, the
moving molecules within come virtually to a stop. This
abnormal condition makes some metals superconductive and
extraordinarily sensitive to any form of electrical energy.
Military and commercial applications include increas-
ing the effectiveness of ground and airborne detection, navi-
gation and communication systems, shrinking the size of
computers and solving specialized space cooling problems.
A leader in cryogenic cooling and lightweight turbo-
machinery, Garrett-AiResearch is now developing a closed
cycle cryogenic system to compress and then expand (boil
off) the low temperature gas into its supercold liquid state.
The tiny turbines within the system run on air bearings
and eliminate all rubbing surfaces. Much greater system
reliability and long life is the result... another major ad-
vance by Garrett in the exciting new science of cryogenics.

ever at Bethlehem Steel I
The Bethlehem Loop Course
... and how it works

The Loop Course is our continuing
program for selecting and training
qualified college graduates for ca-
reers with Bethlehem Steel. It was
established some forty years ago.
Its unusual name comes from the
fact that from the very beginning,
the course has included an obser-
vational circuit (or "loop") of a
steel plant.
Promotion from Within
The Loop Course provides man-
agement personnel. Since it is our
policy to promote from within, it is
vital that competent men, well-
grounded in our practices and
policies, be available to fill manage-
ment openings as they occur. And,
due to Bethlehem's steady and
continuing growth, there has been
no lack of opportunities to advance.
The Basic Course
Every looper attends the initial
five-week course held at our home

office in Bethlehem, Pa., beginning
early in July. He attends orienta-
tion talks, listens to discussions by
management men on all phases of
company operations, and makes
daily trips through the local steel
plant. At the end of this period he
has a sound knowledge of the over-
all Bethlehem organization.
Their First Assignments
At the end of the basic course,
loopers receive their first assign-
ments. Ordinarily a large majority
report to our steelmaking plants,
where they attend orientation pro-
grams much like the initial one at
Bethlehem. During this period,
plant management closely observes
each looper's aptitudes and inter-
ests, with the objective of giving
him an assignment for which he
appears to be best fitted, and cor-
responding as closely as possible to
his interests, educational back-
ground , and work preferences. Loop-
ers selected for sales, research,
fabricated steel construction, min-
ing, shipbuilding, and the com-
pany's administrative departments,
proceed from the basic course to
specialized training programs.
Preparing for Advancement
As the looper gains in ability,
experience, and knowledge, and as
openings occur, he is moved into
positions of increasingly greater
responsibility. The company ex-
pects and encourages the looper to
produce ... to make steady prog-
ress. Regular reports on his work
and progress are made to depart-
ment heads—and annual reports to
divisional vice-presidents—through-
out his career.
Emphasis on Technical Degrees
Because of the nature of Bethle-
hem's activities, the greatest de-
mand is for men with technical
degrees, especially those in chemi-
cal, civil, electrical, industrial, me-
chanical, metallurgical, mining, and
naval architecture and marine
engineering.

Read Our Booklet
The eligibility requirements for
the Loop Course, as well as how
it operates, are more fully covered
in our booklet, "Careers with Beth-
lehem Steel and the Loop Course."
Copies are available in most college
placement offices, or may be ob-
tained by writing to Manager of
Personnel, Bethlehem Steel Com-

. suddenly, new hope in life
A man lies on the operating table, crippled with the exhausting tremors of Parkinson's disease. The surgeon
guides a slender tube deep inside the patient's brain until it reaches the target area. Then liquid nitrogen,
at 320 degrees below zero F., is fed to the end of the tube. Suddenly the trembling stops. The unearthly cold
kills the diseased cells ... and a once desperate human being has been given a new chance in life. ► Medical
reports have indicated that not only Parkinson's disease but also other disorders causing tremor or rigidity
have responded to this new technique in brain surgery. The operation has been described as easier on the
patients than previous surgery, and they have been able to leave the hospital in a surprisingly short time.
Also, encouraging results are reported on the use of cryosurgery, as it is called, to destroy diseased cells in
other parts of the body. ► Through its division, Linde Company, Union Carbide was called upon by medical
scientists for help in designing and making equipment to deliver and control the critical cold required in this
new surgery. This dramatic use of cryogenics, the science of cold, is an example of how research by the
people of Union Carbide helps lead to a better tomorrow.

Marchers carrying signs protesting President Kennedy's
Cuban action; groups picketing northern stores which have
segregated southern branches; peace vigilantes standing in
front of the county building; these are recent instances of
that age-old custom—student demonstrations.
The students of Socrates were, perhaps, the first student
demonstrators, protesting Socrates' condemnation and death
by drinking hemlock. Down through history, students have
always been quick to protest and demonstrate. But in this
modern, ever changing world, it is perhaps, time for
a change.
Why do students demonstrate? First, they feel a need
to assert their new-found independence, to break ties with
the past. Secondly, they need to release their pent-up emo-
tions from the pressures of pursuing a college education.
These may be reasons, but they certainly cannot be called
excuses. They are outlets, other than demonstratons, that
could be utilized. Activities, athletics, and social functions
are much more worthwhile outlets, since they provide per-
sonal improvement.
Just last month, 40 University of Michigan students
drove to Washington D.C., to march on the White House to
protest President Kennedy's action on Cuba. What did they
accomplish? They lost time from their academic studies.

and spent funds of the Student Peace Union, which could
have been put to a much better use for the cause of peace.
In the final analysis, a demonstration has a negative
effect. The average, responsible American citizen is repelled,
antagonized, and insulted by a demonstration of this kind.
A neutral person is antagonized to the point of sympathizing
with that idea, which the demonstration opposes. The
demonstrators lose, not gain.
What recourse is available for these students? A con-
structive program of speeches, seminars, letters to editors,
literature, and magazine articles would provide a more ob-
jective platform for people to decide on their ideas, right or
wrong.

Control
Theory
by Alan Vartabedian
Man's environment is becoming in-
creasingly complex, although man, him-
self, remains unchanged. To compensate,
man has had to construct simplyfying de-
vices and models. Previously, these mod-
els have been of the physical world only;
but now, with the aid of computers and
information theory, several models of the
incredibly complex business world have
been constructed.
Since World War II, mathemati-
cians have been attenmpting to
supplan our traditional ways of mak-
ing business decisions by using com-
puters and exotic mathematical mod-
els. In the field of top management
control, they have succeeded in de-
veloping powerful tools which can
greatly simplify the art of making a
business decision. With the use of in-
formation theory, operations re-
search, system simplification, model
simulation, and gaming, managers are
armed with a quantitative means of
predicting their future business posi-
tions.
The objective of developing an
idealized business model which can
be programmed for a computer is to
simulate, on a contracted time scale,
the real operation of a business which
consists of a synthesis of man/ma-
chine systems. What goes into the
model is a set of logical and empiri-
cal relationships based on experience.
These are in the form of equations
relating price with advertising. In-
cluded also are facts such as case his-
tories, starting conditions, informa-
tion flow, and a time lag relationship.
The whole spectrum of business
operations is treated in the simulated
firm. The simulation usually involves
decision-making situations. It can also
be used for problems requiring an
operations research type analysis.
The most immediate use of such a
simulation is as a management teach-
ing tool. Its further applications are
in using the model as a means of
analyzing business problems and ob-
taining quantitative answers. And
also for research in exploring the na-
ture of our complex business environ-
ment.
All the models proposed for man-
agement control are based on system
simplification. They are in some way
designed to cope with the problem of
long range planning versus the short
term profit squeeze.
The weakest link in corporate man-
agement is the inability of top execu-
tives to see new operational oppor-
tunities. For instance, in installing
new automation a change of ap-
proach in production confronts man-
agement. For the venture to be a
success the nature of the corporate
organization must be changed and
such changes are often neglected.
Moreover business has become
quite complex since World War II.
There are many executives who find
themselves making at least one mil-
lion-dollar-decision each year. This
in itself demands that we develop a
more definite basis for making busi-
ness decisions where high risk is in-
volved. We are constantly reminded
of "What happened to the Edsel?" (a
250 million dollar investment for
Ford). The problem of a fast moving
technology and system obsolescence
also complicate the picture.
The objectives of systems simplifi-
cation are a synthesis of operations re-
search with industrial engineering
and systems engineering. It aims at a
simplification of total business objec-
tives, plans, and policies. Simplicity
is the keyword in developing a frame
of mind at top management levels
which encourages an imaginative ap-
proach in tackling systems problems.
Hence, organizational inertia is dis-
pelled by a comprehension of total
systems objectives, operations, and in-

cause an improvement in one aspect
of the organization might result in
the deteroriation of some other aspect
(this is the high cost of piece meal
management). An example of this
is our federal tax code, which is im-
plimented on a yearly basis and
which is a hodge-podge of unordered
rules.
In constructing a model of a busi-
ness environment, we need to know
all the functional relationships which
determine that model. If these rela-
tionships are not known, we run into
trouble. Most of our problems in in-
ventory control and material sched-
uling have been solved by the use
of data processing methods. But, up
to the present, very little has been
done to help in making decisions
ing and accounting added to intui-
tion in mathematical form are fed to
the computer. This technique is char-
acterized in that judgement enters
early in the analysis, instead of only
at the end in evaluating the results.
The method is based on a theorem
of the 18th century Englishman
Thomas Bayes. It states that if you
know the probability that an event
will occur and later get additional
evidence (which could differ from the
first) an estimate of the true proba-
bility results from combining the two
probabilities. In this method the data
make up one set of the probabilities
and management makes up the other.
As an example, in determining
plant size for a new product, DuPont
used experienced managers' judge-
ment in constructing a probability

about an unknown future for which
we cannot construct a mathematical
model. It is this area that is the ob-
ject of our greatest concern. We wish
to develop means by which we can
predict the result of a capital expan-
sion, price change, or organizational
shake up.
One method as proposed by Robert
Schlaifer of the Harvard Business
School uses Bayesian decision theory
in combining mathematics with intui-
tion in the problem solution. In es-
sence this envolves substituting man-
agerial judgement when facts are
scarce. Data compiled from engineer-
function for sales and combined this
with cost data in the computer.
Statistical probability, in its tradi-
tional sense, is valid only when based
on observed events. Hence, one can
extrapolate from past experience to
get his answers. We know, for in-
stance, that over a large number of
tosses of a coin half will be heads and
half will be tails. But in business,
straight-forward probability calcula-
tion does not tell everything. Tradi-
tional statistics has very limited appli-
cation since there are few instances
in business where it can lie applied.
However, Schlaifer's approach can be
applied to almost any business situ-
ation.
Conditions external to an event may
very strongly affect its probility of
occurance. Factors such as national
income trends, market conditions and
availability of factor inputs will all
affect the success of the introduction
of a new product. It is at this point
where management judgement be-
comes very important.
Schlaifer's method seems to have
greatest application in market re-
search where profits can be maxi-
mized and the premium is on high
risk alternatives.
Another approach to management
control is through the use of in-
formation theory. It is concerned
with the detection of signals in the
presence of noise (any distortion in
communication). The resulting
smoothing and prediction of station-
ary time series is done by information
theory for the purpose of separating
signals from noise.
Much of management's work in-
volves predicting the future in the
tasks of forecasting sales, demands
and inventories. Such predictions
are based on an extrapolation of past
history by means of running averages
or weighted averages such as expon-
ential smoothing. We can accurately
predict the future by means of a
knowledge of the factors which deter-
mine the results. There must be a cor-
relation of these results at various
times with a cause—effect relation
working. The best prediction, then,
would involve discovering the factors
involved and use the known relations
for prediction or change them so as
to "smooth" the process, thus remov-
ing the random effects and displaying
a trend. Simulation methods are be-
ing developed to handle problems of
this kind.
Using a totally different approach,
Ackoff has devised a decision model
based on information theory. In this
model "the eventual decision is made
by playing a game against nature. In-
cluded into the model is a criterion
by which the degree of orientation of
the decision maker in his environ-
ment can be judged, as compared with
other decision makers in comparable
environments."
As an example of Ankoff's ap-
proach, we would consider an execu-
tive who wants to expand production
capacity for a certain product. His
possible choices of action are expand-
ing his present plant, replacing old
14

products. The outcomes of his actions
will be measured by net returns over
a period of time. Outcomes will be
categorized in dollar-income ranges.
In addition to isolating his possi-
ble inputs, the manager must predict
on a probability basis his potential
sales. Sales analyists would assign
probabilities to various sales ranges.
An example would be a 2% increase
in sales with a corresponding proba-
bility of .06. Furthermore, each al-
ternative would be evaluated over
every one of the forecasts and net in-
come would be calculated. These cal-
culations would include revenues,
and the costs of all factor inputs. Con-
sequently, he would account for the
probabilities of each forcast and eval-
uate these over all forecasts to opti-
mize profits.
The model, as proposed here, per-
mits the manager a logical choice of
a course of action. This choice de-
pends on the relative value of a po-
tential outcome and the probability
that that outcome will occur. This
model is especially applicable to en-
gineering economy problems. Its sig-
nificant value lies in eliminating noise
from the various signals confronting
the manager. The decision maker
thus has a tool which allows him to
eliminate all distorting factors in
making his decision.
Thus far we have seen some of the
basic factors on which one would
construct a model approximating the
real business environment. With such
a model in our grasp it would be of
interest to explore its possible appli-
cations.
Lockheed Missiles &amp; Space Com-
pany has developed within the past
two years a management game de-
signed to simulate various aspects of
the aerospace industry. Called The
Aerospace Business Environment Sim-
ulator, the game attempts to give
managers experience and practice
in decision making without the at-
tendant hazard of financial loss due
to learning errors. The model is pro-
gramed for the IBM 7090 computer.
The procedure involves separate
teams of managers representing com-
petitive companies in the aerospace
industry. Each team makes decisions
which are fed into the computer. The
computer prints out results analogous
to what would happen in the real
world. The teams compare the results
with their objectives and adjust their
approach in the next round for im-
provement. The simulated period
represents a calendar quarter.
Teams begin with identical com-
panies but consequent decisions affect
a teams competitive standing as well
as the whole industry. The decisions
involve procurement of resources, op-
erations, and contract bidding. The
results of decisions are in the form of
financial and operating reports, con-
tract awards, and new proposals to be
bid.

C. Emphasizes long rang planning.
D. Discriminates between relevant
and irrelevant information.
In trying to appreciate the models
that man has created of the business
world, we are moved by the fact that
as man's environment becomes in-
creasingly complex man remains the
same. To compensate, man has made
systems and devices which simplify
his task. And in doing so he has de-

The model allows the decision-
maker complete freedom in a partic-
ular area. For example, he can hire as
many laborers as he chooses, but he
will soon learn that contract awards
are determined by such factors as bid
price, experience, and capability; and
he will adjust his labor input to
maximize his competitive position.
He must also decide on the amount
of risk he is willing to assume and
how much current profit he is willing
to forgo in order to improve his com-
petitive position.
After the game is completed, it is
often difficult to determine the win-
ner. The winner is often judged in
terms of equity or net income. But
attaining a high equity position
might have been the result of a de-
crease of research and development
expenditure which would effect the
companies position at some later date.
In general the program achieves
the following:
A. Gives an understanding of the
objectives of the company.
B. Gives participants an intuitive
feel for the interacting forces in
velopcd means by which he can grasp
and cope with the totality of the
problems he faces.

PHERIC
FIRE
by Paul Niffenegger
The thunderstorm is a part of the
mechanism by which the earth maintains
its electrical equilibrium. The effect is
explained by the behavior of water drop-
lets within the cloud. This behavior re-
sults in a negative charge distribution on
the base of the cloud resulting in a poten-
tial difference between earth and cloud.
Every year the earth experiences
some 16,000,000 thunderstorms, each
with energy equivalent to the atomic
bomb. From these thunderclouds is-
sue countless tons of precipitation
and about 100 flashes of lightning in
any one second throughout the year.
In 1752 Benjamin Franklin proved
that these lightning bolts were elec-
trical in nature, and less than a year
later invented the familiar lightning
rod.
Following Franklin and other early
experiments, science has been pur-
suing two of the most fascinating
questions of our time: What mechan-
ism provides the tremendous electrical
energy of lighting and by what pro-
cess is the flash initiated? How science
answers these questions is the topic
of this article.
Atmospheric Electrification
The earth and the sky above it are
electrically charged. The earth is
charged negatively with greater than
400,000 coulombs, and the ions-
phere (upper atmosphere) has an
equally large but opposite positive
charge. The air which separates
these two changes has many posi-
16
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


tive and negative ions, which are
produced primarily by cosmic radia-
tion and natural radioactivity. These
ions permit the air to conduct small
amounts of electricity from the earth
to the ionosphere and help unleash
the huge energies contained in the
lightning bolt.
Jt has been found that the iono-
sphere is some 300,000 volts positive
with respect to the earth. This
amounts to an average potential
gradient of about 150 volts per
meter. Every object on the earth is
the field due to the 300,000 volts, and
each, in conjunction with the air,
conducts an electric current.
The total current which leaks be-
tween the earth and sky amounts to
H00 to 1800 amperes or about
.000009 amperes per square mile.
Therefore, the current through a
man six-foot, six-inches tall who
would have a potential difference of
300 volts between his head and feet
would be too small to be significant.
However, this is the current in fair
weather.
When a thundercloud is overhead,
the potential gradient jumps from
150 v/m to 10,000-20,000 v/m.
Under such a strong field, the cur-
rent flowing between objects and
the ground can be easily measured
since it amounts to several micro-am-
peres or much larger, depending on
the height of the object. This current
is negative and larger than the posi-
tive, fair-weather current. St. Elmo's
Fire (luminous glow from electrical
discharges) is frequently observed on
objects under a thundercloud be-
cause of the high potential gradient
and the associated current How. It is
believed that the earth maintains its
constant charge through the frequent
occurrence of thunderstorms which
transfer positive charge from the
earth to the upper atmosphere by the
point discharge currents mentioned
above.
Structure of the Thundercloud
The technical name for the thun-
dercloud is cumulo-nimbus. The
cumulo-nimbus cloud is defined as
"... a great mass rising in the form
of mountains or towers or an anvil,
generally having a veil or screen of
fibrous texture at its top, and at its
base a dense layer of dark, shapeless
cloud with ragged edges from which
rain or snow or hail may fall." Air-
plane pilots have reported seeing
these clouds towering to heights of
about twelve miles, and they almost
always reach a height of seven miles.
The typical thundercloud covers a
land area of 20-200 square miles.
From radar studies and cloud-prob-
ing aircraft it has been found that
this monstrous cloud consists of sev-
eral "substorms" or cells.
The forming cell is marked by
strong updrafts only. Later, down-
drafts also begin and the mature stage
is reached. Whereas typical cells last
an hour or more, the mature stage,
which sends forth precipitation and
lightning, lasts about a quarter of an
hour. The dissipating stage is marked
by weak downdrafts only; and with
it, the cell disappears, often to be re-
placed by another. The rising warm
air currents gain energy from the
latent heat of the condensing water
vapor as they rise and reach speeds
near 65 miles per hour at the top of
the cloud. The falling rain or pre-
cipitation assists in causing the down-
drafts, which reach about 35 miles
per hour.
In 1753 Benjamin Franklin made
the statement, as quoted by B. F. J.
Schonland, " '. . . (I conclude that)
the clouds of a thundergust are most
commonly in the negative state of
electricity, but sometimes in a posi-
tive state—the latter, I believe, is
rare.'" Schonland comments on this
quote: ". . . It could not be put in
better words today, except that for
'clouds' we would now substitute
'base of clouds.'" Numerous experi-
ments have verified this: except for
an occasional small, positively
charged area termed a "pocket," the
base of the cloud is negative and the
top is positive. This accounts for the
negative point discharge currents: the
negatively-based cloud repels nega-
tive charges in the earth below it,
making the earth in that region posi-
tive; and a negative current flows
from the cloud, through the air and
object, into the ground.
The thundercloud thus resembles
the charged earth and upper atmos-
phere, being positive above and nega-
tive below. However, in the thunder-
cloud great electrical energies arc de-
veloped in a comparatively small

The study of plasmas is one of the
most intensive fields of research today.
The plasma promises to reveal much
basic knowledge of the universe, as well
as being an indespensable research tool
in its own right. Even before much is
known about the basic nature of the
plasma, several applications suggest them-
selves.
Solids, liquids and gasses are usual-
ly considered to be the three states of
matter. We distinguish one state from
another by their different physical
properties and by our daily encoun-
ters with them. Thus, for a long
period of time, man thought that all
matter existed in one of these three
basic states because no one had any
experience with any others. But when
scientific experiment took man into
the realm of very high temperature
studies, an interesting phenomenon
was observed. The extremely high
kinetic activity of matter at tempera-
tures in the I04 °K and higher range
caused the atoms of a substance
which ordinarly exist as a unit (posi-
tively charged nucleus surrounded by
equally opposite in charge electrons
of slight mass at great distances) to
break up into individual electrically
charged particles that move about at
random. Man recognized that matter
of this form occuring at very high
temperatures did not behave like any
of the three states familiar to him.
Thus man first experienced a Fourth
State in Matter—the Plasma.
Natural and Artificial Occurrences
The plasmatic state, because of its
unusual properties, is not found nat-
urally on the surface of the earth.
However, plasmas do exist in the at-
mosphere during electrical storms, in
the upper atmosphere as the aurora
borealis, and australis, and in space.
Actually the cosmos is filled with this
electrically charged form of matter.
Plasmas are in no way an unusual
state for matter to be found in; for,
on the contrary, when the vast quan-
tity of plasma in the universe is com-
pared with the amount of electrically
neutral forms of matter, found on the
earth, planets, sun and other bodies,
we realize it is the neutral states of
matter that are the oddities. Man's
experience with matter in the plasma-
tic state stems chiefly from artificial
plasma sources. These devices consist
of various means of increasing the
kinetic energy of matter to the ex-
tremely high kinetic energy of matter
in the fourth state and give rise to
temperatures in the order of 104 °K
or better. Several machines have been
developed for this purpose and men-
tion will be made of them in the fol-
lowing survey of current plasma re-
search.
Current Research
Plasma studies constitute a brand
new field in science. Actual research
is just beginning to scratch the sur-
face for knowledge of the strange be-
havior of matter in the highly ener-
gized plasmatic state. Today, the
greatest amount of research in this
field is being done in the Atomic
Energy Commission sponsored pro-
gram of controlled fusion—Project
Sherwood. Scientists are studying the
properties of plasmas in the hopes of
solving the two most basic problems
to a controlled fusion reaction:
1) Raising plasma temperatures
to the required 30-300 million de-
grees Kelvin and
2) Confining and stabilizing the
plasma to prevent contamination and
loss of heat due to contact with the
container vessel walls.
Research teams from laboratories all
over the U.S. have devised machines
such as the stellerator, magnetic mir-
ror, pinch, Toy Top III and many
others, all with the hope of solving
this bottleneck in the realization of a
controlled fusion reaction that the
plasma presents. In the attempts thus

degrees centigrade have been reached
when working with the most practical
of fusion fuels—deuterium. This tem-
perature, however, was only sustained
for 1/1000 of a second and was only
3/5 of the 50 million degree centi-
grade "kindling" temperature requir-
ed for deuterium fusion. At such tem-
peratures, we can easily see why the
problems of handling matter in the
plasmatic state are great. Before any
self-sustaining fusion reaction is
achieved many problems, such as sus-
taining the high temperatures con-
taining the fusion reactions, obtain-
ing a high degree of purity in the re-
acting fuel, and extracting the power
will have to be solved. Science, how-
ever, is spurred on by the great re-
ward of practically unlimited power
that the controlled fusion reaction
would bring.
Space Travel Application
Plasma studies are being pursued
in many of the nation's aero-space
laboratories. Propulsion experts are
interested in the idea of a plasma en-
gine for "in space" propulsion where
tremendous thrusts are not of pri-
mary importance. Such an engine
would closely resemble an operation-
al chemical engine and would incor-
porate no moving parts except for the
pumping mechanisms needed to feed
in the fuel and to circulate the en-
gine's coolant. (See fig. 1) Hydrogen
gas (only one of many fluids that
could be used) is pumped into a
chamber and a high voltage source is
applied. The gas is raised to the plas-
matic state and is forced out of the
nozzle with a thrust of very high spe-
cific impulse. For this reason, in outer
space the plasma engine is better
suited than the chemical engine.
Small plasma engines have been built
and operated with a specific impulse
of better than 1700 seconds compared
to a specific impulse of a chemical
rocket of about 400 seconds. Addi-
tional refinements in the design of a
plasma engine are incorporating mag-
netic fields and pulsating radio-fre-
quency (rf) signals to further acceler-
ate the plasma. Specific impulses for
these refined engines are well over
5000 seconds I
But many problems also plague the
operational plasma engine. Among
them are the tremendous electrical
power requirement and heavy equip-
ment used to produce magnetic accel-
erating fields in the plasma jet. When
modern engineering is able to reduce
or eliminate these seemingly inherent
difficulties, the plasma engine will re-
place the chemical rocket as a second
generation "in space" propulsion de-
vice.
Material Research Tool
Back in the laboratory, the plasma
jet is proving to be an important tool
in the materials testing department.
The high temperatures developed by
the plasma jet are used in testing
newly developed alloys and ceramics
for their resistance to the destructive
effect of simulated rocket re-entry
conditions. In addition the plasma jet
has been found to be extremely use-
ful in coating substances with vapor-
ized metals or ceramics in a matter
similar to the way a paint sprayer
spreads paints. With a plasma spray-
mosphere. If the plasma could be fo-
cused or harnessed to destroy the
warhead using external electromag-
netic energy provided by ground or
satellite-borne radar or laser beams,
the ICBM defense problem would be
solved, at least in theory."
Commercial Uses
Though nothing as revolutionary
as the anti-missle weapon using plas-
mas has even been made commercial-
ly, a number of useful commercial de-
vices have appeared. Everyone is fa-
miliar widi the fluorescent lamp
which provides "cool" lighting from
much lower power demands, but few
realize that the ionized gas inside the
tube is a type of plasma. A super-hot
welding torch that can produce a
plasma jet from an inert gaseous fuel
has provided industry with an excel-

Flgure I
er, metals with high melting points
like tungsten (6106° F) can be coated
on other surfaces with thicknesses
ranging from a half to a few mil-
lionths of an inch. In addition, this
sprayer can solve the oxidation prob-
lem that might result ordinarily at
these high temperatures by operating
with an inert gas as a working fluid.
Anti-Missile Weapon
Research with plasmas by the Ad-
vanced Research Projects Agency
(ARPA) as a part of its 100 million
dollar Project Defender Program has
lead to the idea that a plasma might
prove to be an effective anti-missile
defensive weapon. In a recent report
the agency theorized, "For ICBM de-
fense the plasma used might be the
one which surrounds and sometimes
precedes a body re-entering the at-
lent non-oxidizing welding device. An
electric generator utilizing a tube of
plasma instead of the conventional
rotating coil of wire (armature) has
been built and is capable of genera-
ting more than 10,000 watts of power.
In several applications, plasmas are
being used in place of thermocouples
for direct conversion of heat into
electricity.
Although this plasmatic state of
matter has found very limited use
thus far, the outlook for its future
commercially becomes brighter every-
time some new basic research is un-
dertaken.

space exploration in the coming

porates a series of programmed steps

Throughout the history of industrial
technology, the machine tool has played
a dominant role. Modern mass produc-
tion was founded by the "machines that
make the machines," and without them
our society would grind to a halt. A fur-
ther appreciation of the machine tool re-
quires some knowledge of its nature and
development, in industry today.
There are many ways in which one
could begin to discuss machine tools.
The most obvious introduction to the
subject is an invitation to the reader
to look about himself, and ask what
he sees that wasn't produced mechani-
cally. In all probability, there will be
very little. Indeed the miracle of mod-
ern mass production is much too of-
ten ignored by the student of engi-
neering. One has only to walk by a
lot with a few thousand new cars in
it or watch a jet aircraft take off to
begin to realize the vast capabilities
of our technology. There are hardly
enough words to describe its magni-
tude. This is no accident, for the
number of engineers engaged in the
area of production is by no means
small.
The forming of materials is the
basic concept in mass production, and
the repeated production of pieces
identical in shape and dimension is
the task of the machine tool. To this
end there have been many types of
tools devised with numerous and
varied methods of reaching a desired
result. Perhaps it would be appro-
priate to mention here that the first
machine tools were built in the later
part of the last century for the British
Admiralty. They were built to pro-
duce pulleys which were needed in
quantities of over one hundred thou-
sand. Before the introduction of ma-
chines, the pulleys were laboriously
carved by hand at a high cost. When
it was observed that machines could
produce such pieces with high qual-
ity and low cost, inventors began to
design instruments to produce every
type of item. Enter the machine tool,
and the industrial revolution!
The forming of materials is an
enormous topic. Metals alone can be
formed by such varied processes as
casting, stamping, sawing, extrud-
ing, forging, and many other meth-
ods which remove metal in the form
of chips. Machine tools generally re-
move metal in chips, though there are
many ways in which this is done. The
differences as well as the similarities
in the various tools provide an inter-
esting background for a brief look
at the major machines.
First, we might ask what common
aspects there are in the different de-
vices. Basically, the answer is that
all machine tools are equipped with
some means of holding the metal be-
ing worked, all have either a recipro-
cating or a stationary tool, and each
has some means of moving the tool
relative to the work. In some ma-
chines both the work and the tool
move. In addition, many machines
are equipped with means of spraying
the cut with a cooling and lubricating
fluid. Machine tools range in weight
from less than fifty pounds for a small
drill press or lathe to many tons for
large planers and boring machines.
Because of their similarities, each ma-
chine must be examined separately
to understand how its function differs
from the others.
The drill press is one of the most
common machine tools, along with
the various types of power saws and
the small lathe. These machines, as
encountered in everyday existence, are
familiar to everyone and so provide
an introduction to the realm of in-
dustrial tools. An industrial drill
press is often quite large, and may
have many drills. Often, there is an
automatic transfer device for moving
work through the machine. The tol-
erances needed for industrial drills
require that the work be held firmly
in a jig, and that the drills lower
through bushings in the jig in order
to maintain accurate centering. In
fact, the design of jigs which will
hold work firmly in place and also
allow the work to be quickly removed
is very important and challenges the
abilities of many engineers.
The industrial lathe is also in-
creased in size over its more familiar
counterpart, but in comparison it is a
far more useful device. Modern lathes
are used for over a dozen operations
including, in addition to its usual
function, drilling, reaming, milling,
and boring. These machines are
equipped with either manual or auto-
matic tool feeds (remember that only
the work turns), and some are
equipped with automatic devices
which enable the lathe to accurately
reproduce the outline of a template.
A somewhat less familiar machine
is the shaper. This machine works on
a fixed piece of metal. A ram, on
which is mounted a cutting tool,
moves back and forth across the
work, the shape of the cut being de-
termined by the motion of the
table to which the metal is fas-
tened. The tool of the shaper will
only cut in one direction, so provision
must be made for the tool to flip up
on the return stroke. Also, it must be
noted that the mechanism is so con-
structed that the time ratio of return
stroke to the forward stroke is about
2:3, thereby providing for economical
operation. Shapers usually work in a
horizontal plane, though some have
vertical rams and are called slotters.
The planer works in the same
basic manner as the shaper, but incor-
porates some improvements and dif-
ferent capabilities. The planer is
larger than the shaper, having its
work mounted on a table and the
tool or tools fastened to a horizontal
rail above. The table moves past the
tools, and the tools only move to
keep in contact with the surface be-
in cut. Very large planers, called
pit planers, have stationary work.
The machine would have to be
twice as long if the work moved).
The technological problems of main-
taining accuracy with such large ma-
chines is a real challenge to the en-
gineer. For example, if an ordinary
planer is making a cut on a heavy
load, the cut must be made without
stopping the machine, because the
oil film on which the table rests
would decrease and not return to its
original size until the machine was
running for a while. Any change in
the film would affect the depth of
the cut, and might lead to serious
inaccuracies.
Another important machine is the
milling machine. These machines are
available in all variety for many spe-
cialized operations. The principle of
milling is simple: the mounted work
is brought in contact with a rapidly
rotating cutter or mill which removes
metal. Milling cutters are designed
for many tasks from cutting slots to
helical gears. The machines are also
available with attachments which al-
low the cutting tool to reproduce two
and three dimensional templates. In

tate about the axis of a hole which is
being surfaced as well as about its
own axis, thus describing a planetary
motion.
Broaching is a rather expensive
forming operation in which a cutter
or broach with several teeth is drawn
across a surface or through a hole.
Each tooth takes a bigger cut than
the on before, and unusual shapes can
be machined. The drawback, as al-
ready mentioned, is cost. Broaches are
expensive to produce, but, if 100,000
or more parts are to be machined,
they may save money over other
methods.
There are other devices falling un-
der the general heading of machine
tools, but they are generally finishing
machines and do not come under the
same category as those we have ob-
served. They are machines such as
honers and polishers, not to mention
the grinder.
It will now prove most interest-
infi to take a look at some of
the new developments in the field.
We can only hope to qualitatively
suggest some of the technological ac-
complishments involved. Of particu-
lar interest to the student engineer to-
day is the development of numerical
control for machine tools. Numerical-
ly controlled tools are capable of pro-
ducing parts simply by receiving in-
structions from a computer! Of
course, the issue isn't as simple as all
that. Successful numerical control is
based on the design of electronics
capable of originating machining in-
structions, and automatic tools capa-
ble of carrying these instructions out
within desired tolerances.
The transfer line can not really be
called one machine tool, for such de-
vices are built up of many automatic-
tools connected by an automatic de-
vice, called a transfer line, which
takes each part from station to station
as it is machined. One can not under-
estimate the importance of the trans-
fer line, for these are machines which
produce finished pieces most rapidly.
There is no doubt that they are the
mainstay of mass production.
Obviously, there is much more we
could say about the subject of ma-
chines tools, but we would then over-
reach our purpose. If we have stimu-
lated some appreciation for the tech-
nology of mass production and some
interest in it, then that purpose has
been fulfilled.

The numerically controlled drill can be programmed to perform a series of opera-
tions to a great degree of accuracy. Programs are punched on tape, and the
machine will perform all drilling and repositioning operations automatically.

INSTRUMENT PACKAGE
Late last September a four stage
Journeyman rocket carried a Michi-
gan designed instrument package
1050 miles above the Atlantic Ocean.
The package was designed to measure
the intensity of low frequency radio
waves originating in the Milky Way.
It performed its task very well. Re-
searchers here at the University hope
that data obtained from this experi-
ment will reveal an approximate
point in space where the intensity of
these low frequency radio waves
drops off. If the location of this point
is found it will reveal physical prop-
erties of the Milky Way that weren't
known before which in turn may
help clarify theories about the origin
and destiny of the stars.
The instrument package, 145
pounds, was the product of scientists
and engineers from both the astron-
omy and electrical engineering de-
partments here at the University. Mr.
Hal F. Schute, Jr., one of the designers
of the package, said the telemetry sig-
nals from the rocket were excellent
throughout it's flight. He also noted
that the interpretation of the data
obtained during the flight would take
several months.
In addition to measuring the in-
tensity of the low frequency radio
waves, measurements taken by the
package may help engineers learn
about the radio background noise
that exists high above the earth's at-
mosphere. Communication between
space vehicles must be made against
this type of noise.
Because of the ionosphere standard
radio astronomy techniques from the
surface of the earth are not able to
make the measurements that the in-
strument package did. The iono-
sphere blocks radio waves of the fre-
quencies that the researchers were in-
terested in. There was also some un-
certainty as to whether the artificial
radiation belt produced by bomb
tests might interfere with the experi-
ment. The final interpretation of the
data will clear up this question, how-
ever, not much interference is ex-
pected because the flight path of the
rocket was well north of the intense
part of the radiation belt. The rocket
was launched from Wallops Island,
Virginia.
MACHINE REPLACED
In order to handle the ever increas-
ing demand by students and faculty,
the Computing Center has installed
an IBM 7090 computer. This ma-
chine, the largest of its type offered
to schools by IBM, has replaced the
slower IBM 709 that was previously
used. The new 7090 is a transistorized
unit that can add 10 digit numbers at
the rate of 240,000 per second. The
old 709 used vacuum tubes and could
only add at a rate of 40,000 times per
second.
Almost 100 courses here at the Uni-
versity require use of the computer
in their class assignments and more
than 2000 students enrolled in these
courses will use the computer in com-
pleting these assignments. This is the
most extensive student use of a com-
puter on any campus in the country.
In addition to student use and per-
haps the greatest percentage of use
will come from the faculty which
annually engages in over 30 million
dollars worth of research.
The University of Michigan has
had had a leading role in the devel-
opment and use of computers since
they came into wide acceptance after
World War II. Electrical engineers
here at Michigan designed and built
the first computer to be used on the
campus, the MIDAC (Michigan Digi-
tal Automatic Computer) in 1951.
This machine was replaced about
seven years ago by an IBM 650 which
in 1959 gave way to an IBM 704.
Last fall the 704 was exchanged for
the 709 which now has been replaced
by the newer and faster 7090.
WIND TUNNEL
In a recent test on a new wind tun-
nel here at Michigan, a velocity 20
times the speed of sound was reached.
The new tunnel operates on the "hot
shot" principle in which high tem-
perature high pressure gases are

test chamber.
To reach the high velocities a large
amount of energy is needed. This en-
ergy is supplied by a powerful electric
arc which heats gases in an arc cham-
ber. After the hot gases have been
heated they pass through a nozzle and
test section, where the model under
test is located, into an evacuated
tank. The whole operation takes
about one-fiftieth of a second.
The new tunnel will be used for
measuring such things as the pres-
sure, shock wave angle, and heat
transfer of models placed in its test
section. Since it is able to simulate
conditions found at altitudes above
100,000 feet, it can be used for in-
vestigating space vehicle problems
which include propulsion control and
re-entry. It will also be used in inves-
tigations of other high speed areody-
namic problems.
The energy requirements for this
tunnel are large. At peak operating
conditions its average rate of energy
transfer is about 500,000 horsepower.
Because of its large energy require-
ments the tunnel can not be operated
continuously over a long period of
time which would be ideal for steady
state experiments. However in some
instances the flow through the test
chamber can be considered steady
state.
Research done in the tunnel will
be mostly for military agencies. Some
of these include the Air Force Aero-
space Research Laboratory, the Ad-
vanced Research Projects Agency of
the Defense Department and the
Office of Naval Research. The instru-
mentation of the tunnel was done by
the Institute of Science and Technol-
ogy here at the University.

nauts are graduates of Michigan.

The large disc at the left which the gentleman in

blank to be used in a telescope. The triangular
ribbed pattern is on the back face of the blank
and is used to reduce its weight while retaining
its strength. Originally the disc was a 40,000 pound
lump of glass. It was placed in a mold, melted into
shape, then cooled for 7 months. The slow cooling
was necessary to eliminate stresses. When ground
and polished the disc will become part of a 60-ton

the largest mobile land machine ever built, follow:
• Its dipper has a volume of I 15 cubic yards.
• It is as tall as a 20 story building.
• It can remove more than 100,000 cubic yards of material
and uncover more than 14,000 tons of coal each day.
• It has 52 electric motors that consume as much electricity
as a city of 15,000 people.
• It is operated by one man who sits in an air-conditioned
control room 5 stories high and controls all the move-
ments of the machine with two hand levers and two foot
pedals.

Most electric motors operate within a limited tempera-
ture range. However, with the motor in the adjoining
picture temperature is no problem. This motor can operate
at top speed which submerged in liquid nitrogen at —320
degrees F. or while in an oven at I I 100 degrees F. Actual-
ly the performance of this motor under these extreme con-
ditions is not what the engineers are testing. They are
interested in the insulation on the motor's windings. This
insulation, incidently, is completely inoganic. Information on
the performance of this insulation will help engineers design
electrical equipment which must operate in extreme en-
vironments. The tests are being made by the Westinghouse

SOLID STATE GYROSCOPE
Security restrictions were recently lifted from the
solid state gyroscope shown in the accompanying pic-
ture. The cylinder in the foreground is the new solid state
gyro, behind it is the shadow of a familiar spinning gyro-
scope. The cylinder is made of a material that vibrates
when a voltage is applied to it and produces a voltage
when mechanically vibrated (piezoelectric effect). The
back-and-forth radial vibration of the cylinder replaces
the spinning wheel of the conventional gyro. Once
vibrating the cylinder will sense any attempt to rotate
it about its axis. It vibrates at about 100,000 times a
second but its actual movement is too small to be de-
tected by an ordinary microscope. The gyroscope was
developed by the Westinghouse Electric Corporation.

friction can make it glow like a red hot

materials normally used in aircraft con-

Making fire a back page story...
Some fires make newspaper headlines. Others barely
make the back page. And a fire sprinkler system can
make the difference!
Sprinklers are the first line of defense against fire. And
Grinnell, pioneer in sprinkler protection, is today's lead-
ing sprinkler manufacturer. Grinnell systems — includ-
ing systems engineered for such special hazards as solid
propellant manufacture — protect lives and property
the world over.
Fire protection is only one reason industry looks to
Grinnell. Whenever piping is involved — from prefab-
ricated assemblies for power plants to valves for food
process piping — Grinnell can meet the need.
Grinnell is piping. The company offers industry the
engineering (from basic metallurgy to piping systems
design and prefabrication); the production facilities
(eight large plants in the U. S. and Canada); the product
line (everything in piping); the experience (over 100
years of leadership in the field) to solve the toughest
piping problems.
Worth remembering — against the day you may have
piping problems to solve. And worth investigating now if
you're looking for the unusual in an engineering career!

area, and the result is lightning. The
separation of the positive and nega-
tive charges is a phenomenon of pre-
cipitation and convection and takes
place after precipitation processes
have commenced. Since the greatest
electrical activity occurs in the region
near or below the freezing point, elec-
trical activity has become associated
with the rain and its frozen phases
within the cloud.
The Lightning Discharge
The lightning bolt is a giant spark
of electricity. Most authorities place
the diameter of the discharge some-
where around two to six inches, de-
pending on how powerful it is.
Flashes have been measured which
were eight miles long in the air and
twenty miles within the clouds. Each
flash is composed of separate strokes
separated by a very short time inter-
val, and the speed of the main stroke
is. about 19,000 miles per hour. Twist-
ing sinuously as air currents move its
path, it will, as Franklin said, ". . .
go considerably out of a direct course
for the sake of the assistance of good
conductors. . . ." Most of the unusual
and interesting stories about light-
ning are due to the erratic motion of
the bolt and its preference for hitting
elevated objects. It is somewhat com-
forting to know that over half of the
lightning discharges take place be-
tween clouds or within them (from a
negative area to a positive pocket).
As mentioned, each lightning bolt
one sees is actually several strokes sep-
arated by a time interval too short
for the human eye to respond to. Pro-
fessor Schonland and his staff from
the Bernard Price Institute of Geo-
physical Research in Johannesburg,
South Africa, have made intensive
studies on the lightning Hash. Their
photographs of lightning strokes
made with a modified (Charles V.)
Boys Camera (a camera in which the
lens is rotated rapidly in front of the
film) have shown that the average
stroke consists of from one to a maxi-
mum of forty-seven other strokes,
with three strokes per (lash being the
average. They are separated by an in-
terval of approximately 1/30 of a
second. Each subsequent stroke is dif-
ferent from the preceding one, and
they have been grouped into four
main categories: the pilot streamer,
the stepped leader, the main stroke
or return streamer, and the dart lead-
er. Each of these will be discussed
briefly.
Basil Schonland was the first per-
son to theorize the existence of the
pilot streamer. Since World War II,
the pilot streamer has been found in
"laboratory lightning," and its exist-
ence has been verified by measure-
ments of potential gradients. It is in-
visible to the camera or eye because
it emits only a faint amount of en-
ergy.
In order to conduct the powerful
lightning currents, the air must be
ionized more than normally. The
stepped leader, which is the first visi-
ble stroke in the lightning discharge,
must have an ionized path prepared
for it by the "pilot" streamer. This
streamer consists of a avalanche of
electrons trailed by ionized air parti-
cles. As the ions begin to return to
their normal, non-ionized state, the
pilot streamer hesitates for a mo-
ment; then a new streamer, part of
the stepped streamer, rapidly goes
down the path and pushes the pilot
streamer ahead as fast as new ions
can fonn; and the process is repeated.
S. B. Griscom, a Westinghouse en-
gineer, theorized the existence of a
lightning prestrike, a short discharge
of large amounts of current following
the pilot streamer (1958). Such a dis-
charge has been measured within the
past three years. In conclusion, the
pilot streamer, and the prestrike
stroke, form an ionized path for the
main lightning discharge.
The stepped leader is so named be-
cause it goes downward from the
cloud base (negative) in steps 30 to
650 feet long, separated by time inter-
vals which range from 15 to 100 mic-
ro-seconds. It hesitates in accordance
with the movement of the pilot lead-
er and therefore has an intermittent
luminosity. If there are no projec-
tions from the ground, at a height of
about 15 feet or more a positive lead-
er comes up from the earth to meet
it. This marks the beginning of the
main or return stroke.
The branched return stroke starts
upwards from the ground with a posi-
tive tip, following the ionized path
the stepped leader makes. Rain drops
"feed" their negative charge (by cor-
ona) to the positive return streamers
which extend up into the cloud.
Thus, the charge flows from the
cloud to the ground, as before; but it
appears the reverse. The main stroke
is brighter than the stepped leader
and travels from one-hundredth to
one-tenth the speed of light, about
ten times faster than the latter.
Though it lasts only 100 micro-sec-
onds, it carries the major portion of
the total current of the discharge.
This is 30,000 to a maximum of ap-
proximately 200,000 amperes. Most
of this current, incidently, flows dur-
ing the first few micro-seconds of this
short time interval.
All the succeeding strokes after the
first return streamer are preceded by
the dart leader, so named because it
seems to "dart" from the cloud to the
ground in one continuous movement.
It travels one-hundredth the speed of
light, typically, and is followed by a
return streamer. It also travels in the
ionized path made by the strokes be-
fore it.
Figures expressing the quantities
and force of the electrical energy of
lightning discharges are impressively
large. The voltage reaches values of
100,000,000 volts or more with cur-
rents up to 340,000 amperes. It has
been calculated that some flashes
have an electrical energy which sur-
passes the peak output of the entire
United States' power systems. An esti-
mated three-fourths of this energy is
converted into heat. The ionized
channel reaches temperatures of 15,-
000 °C in a few ten-millionths of a
second. The heated air expands ex-
plosively and the powerful sound
waves known as thunder are created.
The Electrification of the Thundercloud
It was previously stated that preci-
pitation, especially in the ice phase, is
present in electrically active clouds.
There are many theories regarding
the mechanism of the charge's gener-
ation. Probably no one theory can
adequately describe what does hap-
pen within the cloud; but to be ac-
cepable it must do the following:
(a) explain the presence of a negative
cloud base and positive top; (b) pro-
vide an explanation for the rapid
generation of charge under condi-
tions found in the cloud (electric-
charge generation is a continuous
process); (c) work experimentally.
Of the many past theories regard-
ing charge generation in the thunder-

It's now a fact: every Ford-built car In '63 has self-adjusting brakes
"Give us a brake," Ford Motor Company engineers were told, "that
will automatically compensate for lining wear whenever an adjustment
is needed—and make it work for the entire life of the lining."
Tough assignment—but not insurmountable. Today, not only does
every Ford-built car boast self-adjusting brakes, but the design is so
excellent that adjustments can be made more precisely than by hand.
This Ford-pioneered concept is not complex. Key to it is a simple
mechanism which automatically maintains proper clearance between
brake drum and lining.
Self-adjustment takes place when the brakes are applied while backing
up. This adjustment normally occurs but once in several hundred
miles of driving. The brake pedal stays up, providing full pedal
reserve for braking.
Another assignment completed—and another example of how Ford
Motor Company provides engineering leadership for the American Road.

The story of this new type of timing gear illustrates why the die casting in-
dustry is one of the most challenging a young engineer can enter. Notice that the
center of the gear is a metal die casting, while the teeth are of cast nylon, bonded to
the metal center. The result is a gear of tremendous tooth strength, which runs quieter and
wears longer than conventional gears. This one took a lot of thinking, engineering and
experimentation to work out, but it's worth the effort to us . . . and to our customers. If

cloud, not one survives in its entirety.
Among the more important are C. T.
R. Wilson's capture theory, C. G.
Simpson's rupture theory (1915,
1927), and J. Elster and H. Geitel's
theory. The mechanisms described in
them are now believed secondary, if
they contribute at all to the genera-
tion of charge. The supposition
which holds much promise was ex-
pounded by B. J. Mason in the early
1950's. It is interesting to not that
certain elements contained in
Mason's theory were anticipated by
other authorities in this field of mete-
orology. The aforesaid theories war-
rant some discussion as they reveal
significant facts about thunderclouds
and charge generation.
J. Elster and H. Geitel, German
scientists, proposed that the earth's
electric field charged the water drop-
lets present in the clouds and that the
drops were then separated by the
wind currents, the small positively
charged drops going to the top of the
clouds and the bigger negative drops
to the bottom. But this theory does
not account for the fact that falling
rain is usually positive or that frozen
precipitation, especially soft hail, is
present when charge generation is
evidenced. Nevertheless, it is not un-
likely that the earth's field does aid in
electrifying the thundercloud.
The rejected Simpson Rupture
Theory states that the air currents
break up water drops into large posi-
tive fragments, the air and small frag-
ments becoming negative. This would
make the base of the cloud positive,
which it is not, although it might pos-
sibly be partly responsible for the
positive "pockets." While drops do
acquire a charge when broken up, as
Simpson has stated in his theory,
more recent investigations have
shown that if this is the process, it
must occur below the freezing level in
an actual cloud, which it cannot.
Other laboratory experiments have
shown this process could not produce
the needed electrical energy.
According to the Wilson Capture
Theory, falling drops acquire a nega-
tive charge by capturing the negative
ions in the air, whose number is in-
creased by the field of the storm, and
by induction from the earth's field.
Yet, Wilson's theory also does not ap-
ply to the frozen precipitation nor
does it fully explain the rapid charge
generation. It is generally accepted
that his process does aid in the gen-
eration of charge, though.
B. J. Mason, who is professor of
cloud physics at the University of
London and an authority in this
field, recently presented the theory
that the ice or frozen precipitation ac-
quires a negative charge and falls to
the base of the cloud. As it falls, small
droplets collide with and freeze on
it, ejecting spicules which carry a pos-
itive charge. These spicules break off
in the updrafts and are carried up-
wards along with light, positively
charged ions.
Prior to the publication of Mason's
theory, meteorlogical experiments re-
vealed the positive center is continu-
ously being separated from the nega-
tive center, advancing upward as if
it were blown to the top of the cloud
by updrafts. The negative center was
found to remain in the precipitation
zone of the cell, extending six and a
half miles above sea level where the
air temperature approaches —40 °C.
This is the lowest temperature to
which water droplets can be cooled.
It has been known for some time that
water drops freeze from the outside
and as freezing progresses, the thin
ice shell bursts, ejecting spicules of a
positive charge. These minute protu-
berances are very easily broken off
leaving a considerable negative
charge on the remaining frozen drop-
let. D. J. Malan and B. F. J. Schon-
land believed this to be the principal
phenomenon in the electrification of
the thundercloud and possibly the
original triggering process.
Mason and his colleagues theorized
that as these frozen droplets fall, they
continually hit more supercooled
droplets, becoming more negative as
the positive spicules form and are
broken off by the updrafts. Perform-
ing many laboratory experiments,
they calculated that this process
could furnish the needed electrical
energy. Workman, Reynolds and
other American researchers found
that collisions between cold ice cry-
stals and warmer hail leaves the cry-
stals positively charged and the hail
negative. (1950). But this is not suffi-
cient to create the magnitude of
charge needed; therefore, it has been
suggested that the latter process as-
sists in charge formation, with C. T.
R. Wilson's, lower down in the cell.
Mason's theory is in perfect agree-
ment with the important facts known
about thunderstorms. It also meets
all the stipulations for a sound
theory. It is because of these reasons
that this theory is, at present, con-
sidered the most accurate explanation
of the mechanism of charge genera-
tion.
Summary
The thunderstorm is a part of the
terrestrial electric system. It helps
maintain the earth's electrical equi-
librium through lightning discharges
and rainfall. It is in reality a giant
electrical generator with precipitation
to generate the electricity and power-
ful wind currents to supply the physi-
cal power.
Within the vortex of activity
known as the cell, the processes of
charge generation are continually at
work. When the updrafts and down-
drafts have separated the charges, and
when the charges have grown to suffi-
cient size, invisible ions in the air
multiply in number as the electric
streamers start outward from a nega-
tively charged region in the cloud.
The streamer and leader strokes com-
plete their path; and then, in a frac-
tion of a second, everything is over:
the firy bolt has seared its way across
the sky unfurling its awesome glory in
a brilliant flash and thunder.
Ironically, the cause of this show
of might is the seemingly insignificant
water droplet. Over 200 years ago
Franklin pondered the question of
what caused the "spark," but it has
been just recently that Mason and the
other dedicated scientists who work
in this field have shown that the
cloud droplets generate charge upon
freezing; and they have succeeded in
defining in detail the mechanism in-
volved.

• ENERGY CONVERSION IS OUR BUSINESS—Admittedly, a broad
and far-reaching theme, but then, so are the scientific investigations now underway at
Allison Division of General Motors.
Within our 217-acre R&amp;D Center in Indianapolis, Scientists and Engineers consider all
aspects of energy conversion—utilizing nuclear/solar as well as chemical forms of energy.
Allison—long a leader in advanced types of aircraft engines—now is extending capabilities of
turboprops to meet urgent, new military needs generated by current limited warfare require-
ments. There's emphasis on new engines for V/STOL applications, incorporating BLC
(Boundary Layer Control), and programs to maximize fuel economy and range through
high temperature regenerative cycles.
In the nuclear energy conversion area, Allison is prime contractor for development of
MCR (Military Compact Reactor)—a highly mobile, completely self-contained
nuclear fission power system—to provide electric power in remote areas.
First and second stage rocket engine cases designed and produced by Allison for Minute-
man have achieved a 100 per cent reliability record. Allison's steadily growing competence
in the field is reflected in the forward strides made in titanium and glass filament-wound
ICBM cases. Also, in the missile field, Allison has developed a highly efficient regenerative
liquid metal cell that may point the way to a powerful yet compact electrical system for
space-age applications.
That's a small sample of the broad diversification of our activity today.
Perhaps there's a challenging opportunity for you in the creative environment at Allison.
Talk to our representative when he visits your campus. Let him tell you first-hand what it's
like at Allison where

EVER HEAR OF A SOLUTION
IN SEARCH OF A PROBLEM?


It happens at Du Pont. Frequently. That's because 1350
technically trained employees are engaged solely in pioneer-
ing research. They're in the business of discovery, develop-
ment and follow-through. Sometimes the newly discovered
chemical poses the question, what to do with it?
For instance, Dr. Thomas J. Swoboda, a member of the
Central Research Department staff, and his associates re-
cently discovered a new family of metallic compounds,
chromium manganese antimonides. They're unusual materi-
als. Over a specific temperature range they are magnetic.
As temperature drops, the magnetism does too.
The chart, pictured with Dr. Swoboda, shows the sharp
magnetic transition. To the right, the material is ferri-mag-
netic, to the left (at low temperatures), anti-ferromagnetic.
So we have a solution. Now to find the problem it will
solve. This situation was largely true when nylon was dis-
covered. Only later did we find the many problems which
its unique characteristics would solve—from cord for air-
plane tires to plastics for gears.

be placed on plasma studies. As man
ventures out of his own electrically
neutral world into space, he will have
to meet the problems presented by
matter in its fourth state. While on
earth, plasmas serve as tools for re-
search in the highly energized fourth
state of matter; but out in space, plas-
mas become one of the dangers that
men in space will have to face.
Since plasmas by nature are com-
posed of electrically charged particles,
one of the primary problems encoun-
tered would be communications. This
point was recently demonstrated in
Project Mercury flights where the
manned capsules, upon re-entering
the earth's atmosphere, were sur-
rounded by a plasma that blocked
out all communication.
Out in space, man will have to pro-
tect himself from the radiation of the
Van Allen Radiation Belt and tem-
porary radiation hazard from high
altitude atomic explosions. These
belts of radiation are actually highly
energized matter in the form of a
plasma.
Man must overcome further diffi-
culties with plasmas before he pene-
trates space and attempts to land on
a planet with any type of atmosphere.
When entering the foreign atmos-
phere of another planet, a plasma
will form around the vehicle and the
damaging effects of this plasma will
have to be determined. For this rea-
son, research is being conducted on
materials entering at re-entry speeds
in simulated atmospheres of the plan-
ets such as Mars and Venus, probably
the first two planets that man may
explore.

pathway for rapid professional growth.
Current openings are distributed over the 17 laboratories
within the division. A talented man can concentrate on the
field of his choice at one laboratory, or move freely anywhere
within the complex as his career advances. He can become a
technical specialist or develop the broad background required
to enter large-scale systems engineering.
Sylvania Electronic Systems, established late in 1954, now
has over 6,500 employees in six different operations (approxi-
mately 2,300 engineers and scientists). There are three main
locations: Western Operation (suburban San Francisco), Cen-
tral Operation (suburban Buffalo) and Eastern Operation
(suburban Boston). Also near Boston are operations serving
the entire division: Applied Research Laboratory; Product
Support Organization; Systems Engineering and Management
Operation.

Must you join a giant company to work on big projects?
Take the Nuclear Ship Savannah.
Many giant companies helped build
her. Many smaller companies also
contributed significantly to her suc-
cess. In fact, her most significant
feature—the reactor—was designed
and built by Babcock &amp; Wilcox.
B&amp;W is large enough to win con-
tracts for big projects. 1961 sales,
for example, were more than $300
million. And every year, B&amp;W in-
vests many millions of dollars in re-
search and development. B&amp;W of-
fers many other advantages of the
large company: formal training pro-
gram, paid tuitions, wide variety of
job openings (16 plants in 8 states),
plus the security and benefits of a
large 95-year-old organization.
B&amp;W is small enough to give you
a chance to work on big projects
early in your career. There are 150
larger industrial companies in the
U.S. Growth opportunities are enor-
mous. Yet only 58 bachelor-level
students will be hired in 1963.
B&amp;W has interesting job openings
for graduate and undergraduate
engineers and scientists, including
M.E., E.E., Ch.E., Met.E., Cer.E.,
chemist and physicists. You can get

Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering
The picture shows a hydrofoil boat, a type of craft that flies on small wings, or foils, in the water. An-
other advanced type is the air cushion vehicle which supports itself by a blast of compressed air
beneath its bottom. Both types are limited in weight lifting capacity; their speed, however, gives them a
transportation capability between that of a ship and an airplane. In many cases power is supplied by
aircraft type gas turbines.
Craft such as these require design competence in both the aeronautical and marine fields. To meet this
need, we now offer a combined degree program leading to Bachelor's Degrees in both Aeronautical and
Astronautical Engineering, and Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering. The attainment of the two de-
grees requires about eight credit hours beyond the regular BSE program for a single degree.
Another new dvelopment is our Maritime Engineering Science option. This program stresses prepara-
tion for research and emphasizes basic engineering sciences rather than design. In addition, we continue
to offer options in both Naval Architecture (hull design) and Marine Engineering (marine machinery).
The combined Aero-Marine program and the maritime Engineering Science option are unique to this
institution.

keep your career in motion
Norden's advanced programs give you
a genuine "ground floor" opportunity
to develop your talents, and to help
bring projects like these to successful
completion:
Molecular Circuitry
Norden has developed integrated
crystals which functionally replace
conventional circuits. The crystal
held in the tweezers performs the
same function as the larger and
earlier miniaturized components
shown here.
Inertial Platform
Norden's inertial platform is the
heart of inertial navigation sys-
tems for missiles, space vehicles,
surface vessels, aircraft and sub-
marines. It measures only 8* x
10", weighs 20 pounds and main-
tains vehicle stability regardless
of heading, pitch or roll.
Contact Analog
Norden's contact analog display
provides key parameters for sub-
marines, aircraft and manned
space vehicles. This system utilizes
advanced television and computer
techniques developed by Norden.
Analog Digital Converters
Norden has engineered more than
60 types of analog digital con-
verters for military and industrial
use. Shown here is Norden's
MICROGON digital encoder which
can measure the angle subtended
by a ping pong ball at a distance
of six miles.
Our new multimillion-dollar facilities
make available the laboratories and
equipment you'll need.
Norden also offers excellent graduate
study programs. And living conditions
in Fairfield County are most enjoyable.

(random notes)
Resist education
A certain engineering college recently
asked us for a contribution not of money
but of a small object suitably symbolic
to deposit in the cornerstone of a new
building. After thinking about it a bit,
we sent three intricately shaped bits of
metal so small that one of them got lost
and never found its way into the box
that will be opened some day to show
our descendants the topics that engineers
in 1962 regarded as fresh and promising.
Is it not true that the engineering mind
today is much occupied with working
metals and semiconductors in ways to
get as much performance as possible
from as little bulk as possible?
Doggone right. In addition to making
deposits in cornerstones, we have been
busy expanding the line of photosensitive
resists on which this hot new art so
strongly depends. Everybody in it should
be delighted to learn of KOR, a new one
that's 10 to 15 times as sensitive to arc
light and 30 to 100 times as sensitive to
tungsten light as Kodak's well-known
resist, KPR. This opens up the possibil-
ity of exposing KOR by a projected
image instead of by contact printing,
but the photographic speed is still a little
low for an ordinary enlarger. A high-
intensity projection printer will turn
the trick.
If you don't even know what we are
talking about, you have a dangerous
blind spot in your education which you
could repair quickly by sending a buck
to Eastman Kodak Company, Rochester
4, N.Y. for a copy of "Photosensitive
Resists."
Cheaper than rubies
maybe
We have entered the laser rod business.
This decision looks logical enough.
Lasers are a) very, very, very promising
and b) connected by a strong thread to
a technology about which we feel cocky
—namely, non-silicate rare-earth glass,
which we broke open commercially 25
years ago for photo lenses.
It was a thrill to hear that a rod of
ours commenced action at a threshold
of only 4 joules at room temperature. It
emitted at 1.06ju by transition of Nd***
from 4Fj, to 41(not down to ground
state, which is 41,,,). Its time to techno-
logical obsolescence will be inevitably
and indubitably short.
Meanwhile, for the people busy feel-
ing out the ground rules of laser engi-
neering for machine tools, weapons, etc.,
our neodymium-boron-barium-lanth-
anum-thorium-strontium glass is a good
first choice because 1) neodymium needs
no refrigerants (fluorescence doesn't re-
turn Nd " to ground state); 2) 1.06/1 is
convenient to phototubes, phosphors,
and photography; 3) threshold for laser
action comes at Vs the energy input that
Nd*'* needs in silicate glass.
You have heard of ruby lasers? They
depend on Cr*'*. Cr" depends on the
crystal field to define its energy levels.
Rare earths don't need a crystal field
because their 4f levels are shielded by
5s electrons. Therefore they can work
in glass, which can come big and homo-
geneous. Already a 2" x lA" rod with
ends tuned to reflect ~ 100% and 98% at
1.06/1 costs less than a decent used
motorcycle.
Mr. Guy V. Martin, 110 Yale Blvd.,
S.E., Albuquerque, N.M., has found
EASTMAN 910 Adhesive vastly supe-
rior to soft solder for transmitting ultra-
sonic vibration. He has used up to 60
kc and electrical power inputs up to 200
watts at temperatures up to 200°F.
When he feeds energy like that
through a solder bond from a transducer
of laminated nickel sheets to an applica-
tion tip, the solder deteriorates progres-
sively and the transmission drops steadily.
An EASTMAN 910 bond acts differ-
ently. Without apparent change, it
transmits three to four times as long as
solder takes to reach disintegration.
When the 910 bond finally snaps, it
does so all at once with an audible snap.
In the case of aluminum bonded to the
nickel, rupture always takes place be-
tween the adhesive film and the alum-
inum. With other metals, plastics,
ceramics, or glass bonded to the nickel,
the rupture divides itself between one
interface or the other and doesn't appear
within the film.
Mr. Martin claims that for some 30
years Kodak has been very obliging in
furnishing him helpful information from
time to time. We claim that in volun-
teering his adhesive findings, he has now
amply repaid us. We shall be very happy
to furnish you, too, with helpful infor-
mation for 30 years. EASTMAN 910
Adhesive is obtainable in a $5 sample
kit from Eastman Chemical Products,
Inc., Kingsport, Tenn. (Subsidiary of
Eastman Kodak Co.). It develops great
strength withi.i seconds.

AN INTERVIEW
WITH G.E.'s
DR. GUY SUITS,
VICE
PRESIDENT
AND DIRECTOR
OF RESEARCH

Dr. Suits has managerial responsi-
bility for the General Electric Re-
search Laboratory and as a member
of the Company's Executive Office
he is directly concerned with G.E.'s
over-all research programs and
policies. He joined G.E. in 1930 as a
physicist, and holds 76 patents, is
Chairman of the Directors of In-
dustrial Research, member of the
National Academy of Science,
Director of American Institute of
Physics, previous Chairman of Naval
Research Advisory Committee and
Fellow of the AIEE, AAAS, and IRE,
and has been Vice President and
Director of Research since 1945.

tric training programs, and

Scientific Resources," write

Planning, General Electric
Company, Section 699-05,
Schenectady 5, New York.
How Scientists and Engineers
Work Together in Industry
Q. Dr. Suits, I've heard a good) deal about the scope of your programs. Is your
research mostly in physics and electronics?
A. This is a common misconception. The work of the many laboratories of Gen-
eral Electric "covers the waterfront" in science and in advanced engineering tech-
nology. Some laboratories specialize in electronics research, others in atomic power,
space technology, polymer chemistry, jet engine technology, and so forth. Actually,
the largest single field represented by the more than 1000 Ph.D. researchers in
General Electric is chemistry.
Q. Is this research performed principally by people with Ph.D. degrees in
science?
A. General Electric research covers a broad spectrum of basic and applied work.
At the Research Laboratory we focus largely on basic scientific investigations, much
as in a university, and most of the researchers are Ph.D.'s. In other Company
laboratories, where the focus is on applied science and advanced engineering, engi-
neers and scientists with B.S. and M.S. degrees predominate. Formal college training
is an important preparation for research, but research aptitudes, and especially
creative abilities, are also very important qualities.
Q. What are the opportunities for engineers in industrial scientific research
and how do scientists and engineers work together in General Electric?
A. Classically, engineers have been concerned with the problem "how," and
scientists with the question "why." This is still true, in general, although in ad-
vanced development and in technological work scientists and engineers work
hand-in-hand. Very close cooperation takes place, especially in the increasingly
important fields of new materials, processes, and systems. Certainly in General
Electric, a person's interest in particular kinds of problems and his ability to solve
them are more important than the college degree that he holds.
Q. What does it mean to an engineer to have the support of a large scientific
research effort?
A. It means that the engineer has ready access to the constant stream of new
concepts, new materials, and new processes that originate in research, and which
may aid his effort to solve practical problems. Contact with research thus provides
a "window" on new scientific developments—world-wide.
Q. How does General Electric go about hiring engineers and scientists?
A. During each academic year, highly qualified technical people from General
Electric make recruiting visits to most college campuses. These men represent
more than 100 General Electric departments and can discuss the breadth of G.E.'s
engineering and science opportunities with the students. They try to match the
interests of students and tne Company, and then arrange interview visits. The
result of this system is a breadth of opportunity within one company which is
remarkable.
Experienced technical people are always welcome, and they are usually put in
contact with a specific Company group. Where no apparent match of interests exists,
referrals are made throughout General Electric. In all cases, one finds technical
men talking to technical men in a really professional atmosphere.
Q. Are there training programs in research for which engineering students
might be qualified?
A. There certainly are. Our 2-year Research Training Program at the General
Electric Research Laboratory gives young scientists a chance to work with ex-
perienced industrial research scientists before carrying out research and develop-
ment on their own.
In addition, there are seven Company-wide training programs. Those that attract
the largest number of technical graduates are the Engineering and Science,
Technical Marketing, and Manufacturing Training Programs. Each includes on-the-
job experience supplemented by a formal study curriculum.
Of course, not all graduates are hired for training programs. In many cases,
individuals are placed directly into permanent positions for which they are suited
by ability and interest.

and the race to outer space
If man is to reach the other planets.
and get back to earth...he has three immediate choices: (1) A conventional rocket,
many times the size of anything now existing. (2) A rendezvous in orbit,

Assignment: build
the "grease gun
to our cats

We went to the mountain to
make 1963 Ford-built cars
go 30,000 to 100,000
miles between major
chassis lubrications
Quite a task faced Ford Motor Company
engineers when they set out to eliminate the
traditional trip to the grease rack every
1,000 miles.
Like Mohammed, they went to the mountain—
Bartlett Mountain on the Continental Divide in
Colorado. More molybdenite is mined there
than in the rest of the world combined. And
from molybdenite ore comes the amazing
"moly" grease that helps extend the chassis
lubrication intervals for Ford-built cars. This
grease sticks tenaciously to metal, stands up
under extreme pressures and resists moisture,
pounding and squeezing. It is slicker than
skates on ice!
New, improved seals were developed. Bushings,
bearings and washers of many materials were
investigated. Slippery synthetics, like nylon
and teflon, were used a number of new ways.
The search for means to extend chassis lubri-
cation also led to New Orleans—where
experimental suspension ball joints tested in
taxicabs in regular service went two years
without relubrication.
It took time. And ingenuity. But the effort paid
off when Ford-built cars were the first to build
in chassis lubrication good for 30,000 miles or
two years—whichever came first.
Another assignment completed —another
"Ford First" and another example of how Ford

Splitting atoms ... under control
Inside a nuclear reactor, atoms are split by nuclear "bullets" or neutrons flying at 5000 miles per
hour. Vast amounts of energy are released. In many of today's reactors, the secret of controlling
this chain reaction and putting it to work lies in a special form of carbon known as graphite.
Graphite slows down the neutrons to a working speed and keeps them within the reactor core
where they can split more atoms to generate useful heat. ► And the hotter the better, because
graphite grows even stronger at high temperatures! That's why graphite is also used inside rocket
and missile engines to withstand the searing blast of burning fuels . . . and on nose cones and other
critical surfaces to protect against the intense heat caused by air friction. ► Under the trademark
National, Union Carbide has been making carbon and graphite increasingly useful to industry
for more than fifty years. It is only one example of how the people of Union Carbide are
constantly striving for a better tomorrow.

Automobile production and sales are setting records;
the construction industry is booming; and the economy is
slumping.
At any point in the recent past, the performance of these
two basic American industries gave a very good indication of
consumer and investor confidence, and the strength and
short-term trends of the economy.
But the unemployment rate remains above 5.5 percent.
Economic growth has all but stopped.
This supposed paradox can be explained by a look at
profits. Profits, generally, are lower than in recent times.
Several firms have had to reduce their dividends. This factor
alone would greatly reduce investor confidence. President
Kennedy's unjustified action in the steel price incidents of
last Spring (See The Editor's Pen, May, 1962), further low-
ered investor confidence and triggered the bear market which
ended in the stock market lows of June.
Right now, the economy is limping along on consumer
confidence—the people are buying. Should buying slow
down now, as it periodically does, the impact on the econ-
omy would be great, growth would stop, unemployment
would rise higher, and larger government deficits would
occur.

portance of the multiplier effect. That is, an increase in in-
vestment creates a proportionately larger, or multiplied.

increase in income. A decrease in investment causes a mul-
tiplied decrease in income.
By increasing investment, income will increase, the
economy will grow and be more stable. Investment is im-
portant, but can only be increased by improving investor
confidence.
The United States has grown to its level of greatness
because of the profit incentive for investors. With the low
profits of today, is it no wonder that our growth has slowed
down?
President Kennedy's tax reform program would reduce
all income taxes, including corporate income taxes from
52 percent to 47 percent. This will improve the profit incen-
tive for investors. The flaw in the President's program is
that instead of reducing expenses along with taxes, he is
increasing government spending, creating still larger federal
budget deficits.
The economy depends on the combined efforts of
government and business to work together and improve the
profit incentive to create more investment.

POINT TO PONDER: It has been said that $300 bil-
lion federal deficit is not bad, because it is owed to the
American people. Suppose the debt did not occur, or was
paid off over a period of years, this money would be available
for other investment which would cause the economy to
grow at an almost alarming rate, create more jobs and raise
the standard of living to new levels.

ever at Bethlehem Steel I


What kinds of engineers do you find with Bethlehem?


Here's the answer: Chemical Engi-
neers . . . Civil Engineers . . . Elec-
trical Engineers . . . Industrial
Engineers . . . Mechanical Engi-
neers . . . Metallurgical Engineers
. . . Mining Engineers . . . Naval
Architects and Marine Engineers,
and more.

Every major engineering degree is
represented within the manage-
ment ranks here at Bethlehem Steel.
It makes sense. The mining and
processing of minerals obviously
suggest the need for Mining Engi-
neers. Then come the chemical
processes of coke-making, smelting,
refining. Fuels are consumed, valu-
able by-products are made. Is it
any wonder steelmaking calls for
Chemical Engineers?
And how about the machinery, the

mills, the furnaces, the instrumen-
tation that make up a modern steel
plant? Mechanical Engineers de-
sign them, and frequently supervise
installation. Civil Engineers design
and put up the buildings to house
them, and the feed lines to keep
them supplied.
Power? Steel is the biggest indus-
trial consumer of electric power.
You cannot conceive of a greater
concentration of electrical equip-
ment than in a modern steel mill.
And many steel plants generate
electric power, too. Electrical Engi-
neers are busy fellows in the steel
industry.
Steelmaking calls for volume pro-
duction, complex and scientific,
often highly automated. We manu-
facture numerous finished products,
too, from nuts and bolts to nuclear-
powered cruisers. The Industrial
Engineer finds plenty to do here
at Bethlehem.
What's more, the kind of engineer-
ing degree does not limit a Looper's
assignments. The superintendent
of a huge open-hearth department,
or a giant rolling mill, might well
be an M.E., a Ch.E., a Met.E.,
an I.E., or C.E.
Sales Engineers
Because of the nature of our
products, a man with a technical
background and a "sales personal-
ity" has a great opportunity in
sales with Bethlehem Steel.
Research
Our research policy and our
magnificent new research labora-
tories, in Bethlehem, Pa., offer
unexcelled opportunities for re-
search and development engineers
and scientists. The exciting results
of research promise bright pros-
pects for all Bethlehem operations.
Shipbuilding
As the world's largest privately
owned shipbuilding and ship repair
organization, Bethlehem offers ca-
reers to Naval Architects and
Marine Engineers, as well as to
engineers in many other categories.
The Loop Course
This program was established
some forty years ago, to select and
train well-qualified college gradu-
ates for management careers in the
Bethlehem organization. It was so
named because of an observational
circuit (or "loop") of a steel plant.
After a five-weeks' basic training
period, which is held once a year at
company headquarters in Bethle-
hem, Pa., loopers receive their first
assignments, which call for special-
ized training that may last for a
few weeks or for as long as a year.
Next comes on-the-job training,
and the looper is on his way.

Garrett has provided the environmental system
vital to the space flights of the NASA-McDonnell
Project Mercury capsule. This 89 lb system
controls gaseous composition, temperature and
pressure within the capsule for both suborbital
and orbital flight.
The system automatically maintains an oxygen
atmosphere within a specified pressure range in
suit and cabin circuits during all phases of flight.
It also removes carbon dioxide, water and solid
particles from the oxygen, and controls the
temperature and humidity to comfortable levels
within the pressure suit. In addition, the system
cools electronic equipment within the capsule.
Garrett also designs, develops and manufac-
tures many other major systems and components
for aircraft, space and industry.

We seldom think of such household
items as toothpaste, canned soup, or toilet
tissue as products demanding engineering
skill to produce. Because they are so com-
monplace we take them for granted. How-
ever, a great deal of engineering know-
how goes into every tube of toothpaste,
every can of soup, indeed, every roll of
toilet tissue. Most of their respective in-
dustries are process and packaging orien-
ted. They operate at high volume and
great speed. The soap and detergent in-
dustry is typical of these consumer indus-
tries. Even such mundane things as soap
bars and boxes of detergent demand en-
gineering.
The synthetic detergent industry is
large. In 1958, about two and one-
half billion pounds of synthetic deter-
gent in granular form alone was pro-
duced. Liquids add to this figure. As
mentioned before, speed and volume
are watchwords in the industry; each
Tide packing unit packs hundreds of
boxes per minute. To illustrate the
processes and equipment used in this
industry, and the general engineering
skill needed throughout the consumer
goods field, this article will follow
the production of Tide, a granular
detergent, from basic raw materal to
packaged product.
The chemical processes and their
associated instrumentation are as
complex as those of any other process
industry. The packing facilities pre-
sent a great challenge to modern en-
gineering techniques. As you will see,
a great deal of engineering, both of
the basic theoretical type and of the
practical hardware type, has gone
into this operation.
Tide is made from two organic
raw materials, alkyl benzene and fatty
alcohol. Alkyl benzene, a benzene
ring with an alkyl side chain is ob-
tained from outside sources which
produce it from petroleum deriva-
tives. The fatty alcohols are long
straight chain alcohols with between
twelve and eighteen carbon atoms per
molecule. They are produced in the
first step of the Tide process.
Fatty Alcohol Production
Tallow, the fat by-product of meat
packing, or coconut oil are the start-
ing points. The refined fat or oil is
first converted to its methyl ester. (An
ester can be considered an organic
salt which can be formed by the re-
action of an oil with an alcohol, also
producing glycerine.) The esters are
formed by reacting oil with methyl al-
cohol (methanol). The methyl alcohol
is pumped into the reaction vessel.
Molten sodium which acts as a catal-
yst is charged to the vessel. The fat
is then pumped into the sodium-
methyl alcohol mixture, and the re-
action takes place, forming the methyl
esters. The esters are separated from
the reactants and by-products of the
reaction, washed, and dried. The next
step is hydrogenating the esters under
high pressure to fatty alcohol.
The esters are reacted with hydro-
gen at a pressure of between 3000 and
•1000 psi in the presence of a copper
chromium catalyst. This reaction
takes place in a series of four reactors,
each about forty feet tall. In the re-
actors, fatty alcohols and methyl alco-

purified and distilled.
The fatty alcohols and the alkyl
benzene are converted to the deter-
gent paste in the next part of the pro-
cess. The organic detergents or sur-
factants in Tide are the sulfate of
fatty alcohol (alkyl sulfate) and the
sulfonate of alkyl benzene. The sul-
fate and the sulfonate are first made
in their acid form and then are neu-
tralized to the sodium salt.
Sulfation and Sulfonation
The sulfonation of alkyl benzene is
comparatively simple because the
reaction is irreversible, and side reac-
tions present no major problems. The
sulfonating agent is oleum (fuming
into the pump. The pump provides
the high speed mixing; the recircu-
lating product mix dilutes the enter-
ing reactants facilitating heat transfer
and mixing as the reaction takes place
in the pump and piping. The pump
circulates the mixture through a
water-cooled shell and tube heat ex-
changer to control the temperature of
the mixture. Part of the product mix
is constantly removed. The recircu-
lation ratio (i.e. ratio of recirculating
liquid to product removed) must be
kept high.
The alkyl benzene sulfonic acid is
passed through a reaction coil as it
leaves the dominant bath to allow
time for the reaction to go to com-
pletion. The coil is just a coiled pipe
which provides the necessary hold-up

sulfuric acid). The reaction is highly
exothermic, that is, produces large
quantities of heat. To provide a uni-
form reaction without localized over-
heating, efficient mixing and heat
transfer are necessary. These are pro-
vided by a reactor system consisting
only of a pump and heat exchanger
with connecting piping. The equip-
ment is in the form of a loop with
one entering pipe and one discharge.
The system, known as a dominant
bath, is always filled with recirculat-
ing product mixture. The reactants,
alkyl benzene and oleum, are metered
time for completion, but almost all
of the reaction occurs in the dom-
inant bath.
The alkyl benzene, sulfonic acid
then passes into the second dominant
bath in which the fatty alcohol is sul-
fated. The dominant bath is very sim-
ilar to the sulfonating dominant bath.
This reaction is much more difficult
to optimize, though. Over-sulfation
causes the production of undesirable
side products. Time and temperature-
are both critical. Oleum is used as the
sulfating agent. Fatty alcohol, oleum,
and the alkyl benzene sulfonic acid
are metered into the bath pump.
Again, a high recirculation ratio is
used. The mixture is also sent through
a heat exchanger similar to the one
used in the sulfonating bath. The
product alkyl sulfate (the sulfate of
fatty alcohol) and alkyl benzene sul-
fonic acid pass through another small-
er reaction coil and into the neu-
tralizes At this point, both products
are in the acid form, and excess oleum
is present.
The neutralizer is another domin-
ant bath. Here caustic (sodium hy-
droxide) is added to the sulfonate
sulfate mixture. The caustic neutral-
izes excess acid and converts the alkyl
benzene sulfonic acid and the acid
form of the alkyl sulfate to alkyl ben-
zene sulfonate and alkyl sulfate. The
stream coming from the neutrilizer is
a yellow-white viscous paste.
Crutching
Most of the Tide ingredients are
then mixed in a crutcher. The term
"crutcher" is used throughout the soap
industry for the mixers used on vis-
cous mixtures. The ingredients which
enter at this stage are the two deter-
gents already mentioned, alkyl ben-
zene sulfonate and alkyl sulfate, build-
ers, suds regulator, antiredeposition
agent, corrosion inhibitor, tarnish in-
hibitor, fabric brightener and other
minor ingredients. The builder en-
hances the properties of the deter-
gents and is usually a tripolyphos-
phate in powder form. The antirede-
position agent prevents dirt which has
been removed from redepositing it-
self. The crutcher must mix the in-
gredients completely to insure a uni-
form product. Viscosities of this mix-
ture are above 1000 CP. In addition,
the mix is thixotropic, which adds to
agitation problems. The crutcher is
a tank with a large worm agitator
suspended within. The constituents of
the mix are automatically weighed
and charged into the crutcher. The
worm is then turned on and the mix-
ture agitated. When agitation is com-
plete, the contents of the crutcher
are released to a storage tank which
feeds the spray drying tower.
Spray Drying
The spray drying tower makes the
granules. The towers, which are six
to seven stories high, look like over-
grown silos. The paste mixture is
pumped to the tower by a high press-

ure pump which feeds the tower
through a set of nozzles at the top.
Hot air is blown through the tower
from the bottom upward. When the
mix leaves the nozzle it is in the form
of droplets. These droplets are dried
as they fall through the tower by the
passing air. This is representative of a
standard drying operation: heat is
transferred from the air to the drop-
let, water on the droplet surface is
evaporated by the heat, water from
the interior of the particle diffuses
outward to the surface and is then
evaporated. This drying cycle contin-
ues until the droplet reaches the bot-
tom of the tower. At the bottom it is
in the familiar granule form. The
granules vary in size and shape. The
outer surface is rough. Many have
hollow centers caused by puffing dur-
ing the drying. Puffing is the process
whereby water in the center of the
droplet is boiled, thus exerting a
pressure and forming a hollow in the
center of the granule. When the gran-
ule cools, the steam which hasn't
diffused to the surface condenses. Air
diffuses inward and fills the void.
The air which performs the drying
comes from a direct fired furnace; that
is, the drying air is actually the flue
gas from the furnace. The furnaces
are either gas or oil fired. They must
be very carefully regulated to prevent
formation of soot. Any soot would, of
course, produce a discolored, unsale-
able product.
Fluid flow in the tower is very com-
plex. The droplets do not simply fall
to the bottom. Flow takes place radi-
ally and angularly as well as vertically.
There has been some indication that
particles in the center actually rise
during the drying. In addition, par-
ticle size varies; the larger particles
fall much faster than smaller ones. In
desiging a tower, all of these and many
other factors must be considered. To
provide proper control over the dry-
ing operation, the towers are heavily
instrumented. Some of the operating
variables which determine the prod-
uct are: pressure and flow rate through
the nozzles, temperature and flow rate
of the drying air, and moisture con-
tent of the entering mix. The product
must be uniform and of a certain
density, since it is packed volumetric-
ally and sold according to weight.
Particle size controls solubility proper-
ties and is therefore important. The
degree of drying is also critical.
The granules from the tower go
through a tank where the perfume is
sprayed on. The perfume must be
added subsequent to the drying oper-
ation to prevent evaporation. The
perfumed granules are then conveyed
to an air lift. This is a vertical duct
with air rising within it. The granules
are forced upward by the air. This
operation provides 1) vertical dis-
placement necessary for subsequent
storage and packing operations using
gravity flow, 2) cooling, 3) mixing.
The granules are then stored and
packed.
Packing
As was stated at the beginning of
the article, each Tide packing line
packages hundreds of boxes per min-
ute with fantastic accuracy. Each
package must contain at least as much
as is marked on the box. But, if each
contains much more, the loss incurred
would be staggering.
The boxes are fed to the machine
as Hat printed blanks. These blanks
are automatically opened and the
bottom of the box glued and sealed.
Sealing of the bottom of the box is a
critical operation, because the gran-
ules leak easily.
While the box was being prepared
for filling, the granules have been
sifted and transported by conveyors
to the packing unit. The granules are
fed to one of a series of metal volu-
metric flasks mounted on a rotating
wheel. Each flask contains that volume
of granules which is equivalent to the
weight marked on the box. Hence,
both volume led to the box and den-
sity are critical. Minor variations in
the density can be corrected by vary-
ing the volume fed. But this is lim-
ited. The boxes must be filled within
strictly controlled limits.
The boxes are now ready to receive
the granules in the flasks. The line of
boxes is carried beneath the wheel on
which the flasks are mounted. They
follow the wheel's path for 180°. Dur-
ing this time each box is filled with
the contents of one flask. The filled
box is inspected automatically by a
photo-electric unit which senses
height in the box. The box tops are
then glued and sealed. The glue is
given ample time to dry, and the
boxes are passed through a set of
rollers to eliminate bulging. They are
then case packed and sent on to the
consumer. This packing operation is
actually much more complicated than
described here, but space is not avail-
able for a detailed description.

ATMOSPHERE
RESEARCH
by David Patt
Continuing the Technic's series on re-
search at U. of M.
With most of the nation's public
interest focused on the glamorous and
exciting exploration of outer space,
few are aware of the simultaneous ex-
ploration of the boundary between
the earth and outer space: the upper
atmosphere. Yet, it is the upper at-
mosphere that largely determines the
solar radiation we receive, the wea-
ther we enjoy, and our success at long
range radio communication. And, as
with any area of research, who knows
what discoveries the future may re-
veal. Thus, the Technic visited the
Hight Altitude Engineering Labora-
tory in the Department of Aeronau-
tical and Astronautical Engineering,
where Mr. Leslie Jones discussed the
Laboratory's work.
First, a physical description of the
lab follows. Its staff consists of about
forty-five engineers and its facilities
include three laboratories and one
office. In January, they will occupy
their own building which is currently
being constructed on North Campus.
Basic Aims
The exploration of the upper at-
mosphere presents a problem which
is not unique in engineering research:
that of microscopically describing the
phenomenon! of interest. Hopefully,
an empirical basis for predicting the
phenomena will follow from these
descriptions. Perhaps, even theories
and explanations will follow. Be that
as it may, the description must come
first, and this is the basic job of the
High Altitude Engineering Lab.
Procedure
The method of description con-
sists of measuring the physical struc-
tures of the upper atmosphere: pres-
sure, motion, composition, and energy
as opposed to the measurement of
sub-molecular phenomena such as
radiation. The original, and most
often used approach to upper atmos-
phere exploration is the high altitude
balloon. This approach is fairly sim-
ple and straight-forward. The bal-
loons are launched from the Univer-
sity's testing site at Sioux Falls, South
Dakota and followed by the telemetry
bus (see illustration) with the aid of
radar. The bus contains various com-
munication and data reduction equip-
ment whereby atmosphere density
and patterns are then calculated from
the data received. Occasionally the
balloon leads the bus a merry chase;
for example, one balloon was fol-
lowed all the way to Lake Michigan.
The second approach to upper at-
mosphere exploration is the sounding
rocket. An unguided solid fuel rocket,
carrying appropriate instrumentation,
is fired on a straight up and down
trajectory. In fact, the High Altitude

FROM ROOM

by Jon Tasker
In keeping with an annual tradi-
tion, the Technic is once again priv-
ileged to publish the following report
concerning engineering placement.
The greater part of this report is a
condensation of the Annual Report
of Engineering Placement issued by
Professor J. G. Young, director of the
Engineering Placement Service, Room
128H, West Engineering.
This year, as in the past, the
demand for Engineers appears to
be increasing. According to the
Midwest College Placement Associa-
tion's Annual College Recruiting Sur-
vey, the year 1961—62 experienced an
8% increase in the requirements for
technical graduates. The survey fur-
ther states that only 75% of the re-
quirements for technical graduates
were filled and that, as of July 1st,
1962, some 5000 graduates were still
needed by the 221 employers report-
ing. This gap between the supply and
demand for technical people on the
national level is the apparent reason
for the following changes affecting
University of Michigan graduates as
noted by the Office of Engineering
Placement.
Recruiting pressure for graduates
increased markedly throughout the
year in contrast with the decrease that
took place during the spring of last
year. This increase was evidenced by
a larger number of recruiting visits,
despite a recent trend of multi-divi-
sion employers to consolidate recruit-
ing efforts. The number of plant visit
invitations and acceptances increased
also, but they did not reach the high
of 1960. Starting salaries increased this
year by an amount approximately
equal to that of the preceding two
years combined. Average starting sal-
aries accepted by U. of M. graduates
at all three degree levels appeared to
increase some 2% more than the na-
tional increases reported by MCPA.
The largest increasing salary differ-
entials and the most intense recruit-
ing activity were for advanced degrees
and high scholarship. The aircraft,
space, and electrical products indus-
tries seem to be responsible for this
increase because of their research and
development activities. They are
probably also responsible for an in-
creased proportion of graduates start-
ing out on direct assignments rather
than training programs. This trend
towards research industry, govern-
ment, and education is creating a
shift away from manufacturing-orient-
ed industry, construction and con-
sulting.
The West continues to attract the
greater percent of II. of M. graduates
while the percentage staying in Mich-
igan declined again this year. The
apparent trend is away from the East,
in favor of the Midwest and West.
The following are tables which have
been taken from the official Report
of Engineering Placement and they
are intended to show some of the
more significant facts. (For a more
complete understanding of these facts
and how they effect you, see Pro-
fessor Young, room 128 H, West En-
engineering.)
In contrast to the past two years,
the total number of degrees granted
declined this year by 1%. The smaller
degree programs, except for Materials
and Nuclear, all showed increases
while Civil and Mechanical decreased
significantly. The number of Chem-
ical graduates held even with last
year, whereas Electricals, as a result
of 20% decrease in the number of
M.S. degrees, dropped slightly overall.
The proportion of graduates in each
class and at each degree level shows
no significant change over the past
several years.
There was a marked decrease in the
number of graduate level students
planning to continue school. This de-
crease is probably the reason the per-
centage of students accepting regular
employment rose this year recovering
last year's drop. The military service
continues to claim the same percent-
age of graduates as it has in the past.

The glamour and excitement of space age programs often obscure a fundamental fact. It is simply
that farsightedness must be coupled with sound, practical, down-to-earth engineering if goals are
to be attained. This is the philosophy upon which Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft's position as a world
leader in flight propulsion systems has been built.
Almost four decades of solid engineering achievement at Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft can be credited
to management's conviction that basic and applied research is essential to healthy progress. In
addition to concentrated research and development efforts on advanced gas turbine and rocket
engines, new and exciting effects are being explored in every field of aerospace, marine and industrial
power application.
The challenge of the future is indicated by current programs. Presently Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft
is exploring the areas of technical knowledge in magnetohydrodynamics . . . thermionic and thermo-
electric conversions .. . hypersonic propulsion . . .fuel cells and nuclear power.
If you have interests in common with us, if you look to the future but desire to take a down-to-earth
approach to get there, investigate career opportunities at Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft.
To help move tomorrow closer to today, we continually seek ambitious young engineers and scientists. Your de-
gree? It can be a B.S., M.S. or Ph.D. in: MECHANICAL • AERONAUTICAL • ELECTRICAL • CHEMICAL and
NUCLEAR ENGINEERING • PHYSICS • CHEMISTRY • METALLURGY • CERAMICS • MATHEMATICS • ENGI-
NEERING SCIENCE or APPLIED MECHANICS. The field still broadens. The challenge grows greater. And a future of
recognition and advancement may be here for you.

developments. These vehicles and
others, are now available commercial-
ly; and consequently, the Lab is phas-
ing out its rocket work. However, the
basic interest of the Lab lies in the
experiments carried out by the rock-
ets, and the instruments necessary for
the experiments. One such instrument
is a mass spectrometer which has been
modified to measure ion density. This
spectrometer will be sent up in sound-
ing rockets, and will be included in
the POGO (polar orbiting geograph-
ical observatory) satellite in 1964. The
sounding rockets are able to carry the
spectrometer and other instruments
to a height of 200 kilometers. This
brings us to the most advanced meth-
ods of exploration, the satellite.
The Tiros and Nimbus meteorolog-
ical satellites will be carrying instru-
ments designed by the High Altitude
Engineering Lab, which optically
measure the refraction of star images;
the amount of refraction providing
a measure of atmospheric density.
The Nimbus satellite will also carry
equipment to record the physical fea-
tures of the atmosphere. These, and
other experiments, will significantly
add to the increasing mass of data on
the upper atmosphere.
Applications

research from a practical point of
view, and engineers, especially, like

search data. There are three im-
mediate uses lor the data collected by
upper atmosphere exploration. First,
it is essential to know the character-
istics of the atmosphere when design-
ing space vehicles for re-entry. Second,
the data is used in construction of
weather maps. These maps are indis-
pensable in the prediction of weather
and may, in the future, provide a
basis for the principles by which
weather will be controlled. Final-
ly, knowledge of the ion content of
the upper atmosphere will aid in im-
proving the reliability of long range
communications. Even with these
applications, perhaps the most valid
justification for this, and any other
research, is curiosity.

Our future is in the hands of men not yet hired
At Western Electric we play a vital role in helping meet the
complex needs of America's vast communications networks.
And a career at Western Electric, the manufacturing arm of
the nation-wide Bell Telephone System, offers young men the
exciting opportunity to help us meet these important needs.
Today, Western Electric equipment reduces thousands
of miles to fractions of seconds. Even so, we know that our
present communications systems will be inadequate tomor-
row; and we are seeking ways to keep up with — and antici-
pate — the future. For instance, right now Western Electric
engineers are working on various phases of solar cell manu-
facture, miniaturization, data transmission, futuristic tele-
phones, electronic central offices, and computer-controlled
production lines — to name just a few.
To perfect the work now in progress and launch many
new communications products, projects, procedures, and
processes not yet in the mind of man — we need quality-
minded engineers. If you feel that you can meet our stand-
ards, consider the opportunities offered by working with our
company. In a few short years, you will be Western Electric.
Challenging opportunities exist now at Western Electric for electrical,
mechanical, industrial, and chemical engineers, as well as physical
science, liberal arts, and business majors. All qualified applicants will
receive careful consideration for employment without regard to race,
creed, color or national origin. For more information about Western
Electric, write College Relations, Western Electric Company, Room 6205,

EDUCATION
AND
RESEARCH
by Michael Gordon
NEUTRON EXPERIMENTS
Water, amonia, and other hydrogen
containing liquids are to be the object
of two neutron spectroscopy experi-
ments here at Michigan. Neutron
spectrography is a way in which scien-
tists study the atomic and molecular
structure of materials. It consists of
focusing a beam of neutrons, which
are at a known energy level, at a ma-
terial and observing by spectrographic
means the way in which the beam is
bent, distorted or in any way changed.
The two separate neutron spectro-
scopy experiments are being set up
in a concrete beam-port room of the
Phoenix Memorial Laboratory at the
University.
Professors Paul Zweifel, John S.
King and D. H. Vincent are the
directors of the two experiments.
The difference between the two ex-
periments is in the production of
the neutron beam. Both experiments
start with an invisible stream of
neutrons of a wide range of energies
coming from the base of the Ford
Reactor. They differ in the way
each separates out of the stream a
beam of neutrons with a very narrow
band of energies which would be use-
fid for probing a sample.
In one experiment; the selection of
the narrow band of energy levels is
done by a machine called a "mechan-
ical monochromator." This machine
consists of a bored rotor which is
spun at a constant speed in the path
of the neutron stream. As the rotor
spins the hole or tunnel in it will line
up parallel to the neutron stream for
short periods of time as determined by
the speed of rotation. Only neutrons
at a certain energy level will be able
to pass through the tunnel during this
time; the rest will be scattered. There-
fore, the device effectively produces a
neutron beam of a very narrow ener-
gy band.
In the second experiment the neu-
tron stream from the reactor is sent
through a crystal of copper. The cop-
per crystal deflects neutrons of differ-
ent energy levels in different direc-
tions. A second crystal is placed at a
desired energy level and deflects the
neutrons at this level to the sample.
In this experiment the neutron beam
impinging on the sample is continu-
ous, whereas in the first experiment,
where the chopper arrangement is
used, the beam is pulsed.
From these experiments and others
like diem, scientists at Michigan
will learn more about how energy
exchanges take place between neu-
trons and other materials. This in-
formation will eventually lead to ways
of improving the design of atomic
reactors.
POGO
Michigan will be represented by
two experiments on the POGO (Polar
Orbiting Geophysical Observatory)
satellite to be launched late in 1963
or early in 1961.
One of the experiments will mea-
sure the tiny amounts of gases in the
upper atmosphere. It will do this by
using a mass spectrometer. This de-
vice measures the amounts of gases
in the ionosphere on the basis of their
atomic or molecular weights. The
spectrometer was successfully adapt-
ed for upper atmosphere research
by the High Altitude Engineer-
ing Laboratory at the University.
Engineer Edward J. Schafer was in
charge of its development. The spec-
trometer can measure both neutral
and charged particles, uncommon for
this type of device.

This experiment was developed hy

vatory under the direction of Profes-
sor Fred T. Haddock. It will provide
a rough map of the intensity of low
frequency radio waves throughout the
Milky Way.
TIRE PROGRAM
For the past three years, a research
group in the department of engineer-
ing mechanics at Michigan has been
studying the tire. As a result of
their work, the group is now able to
construct a mathematical model of a
tire and analyze it on a digital com-
puter.
The program they have written for
a tire is a significant achievement for
two reasons: first, because of the prob-
lems that were overcome in describ-
ing the behavior of tire materials;
second, because tire designers will no
longer have to use trial and error
methods, but will now be able to de-
sign a tire directly to vehicle specifi-
cations.
The group, directed by Professor
Samuel K. Clark, made a thorough
study of tire materials and showed
that they could be treated as struc-
tural materials. This meant that elas-
tic theories could be used in a math-
ematical description of a tire. Before
this conclusion was reached, it was
believed that tire materials had non-
linear mathematical properties; and
therefore, that the complicated shape
of an ordinary tire was impossible to
analyze.
An area that proved hard to ana-
lyze was what Professor Clark called
the "interply stress distribution."
This is actually a way of describing
the load carried by the bonding ma-
terial between tire plys. In order to
understand and describe the loading
on tire cords, the group used and
extended the theories of ortholropic
elasticity. These same theories are
used in the plywood design field.
As a result of the group investiga-
tions they now believe that tire cords
carry almost all the load the tire car-
ries. They also believe that, from a
stress standpoint, a tire on a slow
moving behicle is very similar to that
of a tire at rest. However, turning and
high speed stresses are another matter.

CHEMCOR GLASS
The Corning Glass Works has developed a method for making glass that produces a product five times stronger than
was previously possible. The new method is a process called CHEMCOR. It is a combination of different chemical
strengthening treatments which are applied to special glass compositions. The adjoining picture shows a piece of Chemcor
glass being tested on a torque machine. This piece has been twisted thousands of times by the machine without failure.
A line of tableware made from this new glass is already on the market. However the Corning people plan more research
and development for Chemcor before more products are made available commercially.

SALT MINE
The adjoining picture shows the top
of a 1250 foot mine shaft which is near-
ing completion in the Louisiana bayou
country about 100 miles from New Or-
leans. When the shaft is completed it
will penetrate into a 35 million ton salt
dome. Sinking the first 200 feet of this
shaft provided a real challenge to its
designers and engineers. The first 200
feet had to be sunk through an over-
burden of swamp ooze that covered
that area. This overburden, composed
of organic matter and porous fine
grained sand, was so water saturated
that ordinary excavating techniques
would have been constantly threatened
by cave-ins and flooding. This difficulty
was overcome by freezing a 34 foot ice
wall around the shaft location. This pro-
ceedure greatly simplified the actual
shaft sinking.
ELECTRONIC TELEPHONE
SWITCHING
In the not too distant future the
mechanical equipment used by tele-
phone companies to switch phone calls
will be replaced by electronic switching
systems. The adjoining picture shows a
component of one of these systems.
This unit was recently tested in Morris
Illinois. Before going into operation
50,000 simulated failures were pro-
grammed into the system. The system
recorded the patterns for each failure
and the identity of the components that
caused them. It then printed the re-
sults of these tests in a four-volume dic-
tionary. One of these volumes is being
held by the gentleman in the picture.
While in operation the system is con-
tinuously testing itself. When it discov-
ers trouble it indicates exactly where in
the dictionary the repairman should
look to find out what is wrong. The
system is being developed by the Bell
Telephone Laboratories.

interested in studies leading to a doctor's degree in engineering or
physics, you are invited to apply for one of the several new awards
in 1963 on the Howard Hughes Doctoral Fellowship Program.
This unique program offers the doctoral candidate the optimum
combination of high-level study at an outstanding institution plus
practical industrial experience in the Hughes laboratories.
Each Howard Hughes Doctoral Fellowship usually provides about
$8,000 annually. Of this amount approximately $1,800 is for tuition,
thesis and research expenses, other academic fees and books. The
remainder is composed of salary earned by the fellow and a stipend.
Howard Hughes Doctoral Fellowships are open to outstanding stu-
dents. A master's degree, or equivalent graduate work, is essential
before beginning the Fellowship Program.
HUGHES MASTERS FELLOWSHIPS. The Hughes Masters
Fellowship Program offers unusual opportunities for education lead-
ing to a master's degree .. . and, in addition, provides each fellow
with practical experience in the professional field of his choice.
New awards will be made in 1963 to qualified applicants possessing
a bachelor's degree in engineering or physics.
The great majority of the award winners will be assigned to the
WORK STUDY PROGRAM and will attend a university sufficiently
near a facility of the Hughes Aircraft Company to permit them to
obtain practical experience in a professional field of their choice,
by working at the company at least half time. Those associated
with a Southern California facility usually attend the University of
Southern California or the University of California, Los Angeles. An
appropriate stipend will be awarded.
A small, highly selected group will be offered a FULL-STUDY
PROGRAM. Participants in this program will receive fellowships that
permit them to attend an outstanding university on a full-time basis
during the regular academic year with a substantial stipend.
After completion of the Master's Program, fellows are eligible to
apply for HUGHES STAFF DOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS.
For both programs, typical areas of research and development to
which fellows may be assigned while working for Hughes include:
weapons control systems, guidance and control systems, infrared
search and track systems, advanced propulsion systems . . . para-

The perversity of nature (and especially laboratory experi-
ments) has long been known to scientific investigators. Until
now, however, nobody has been able to formulate a general
theory to account for certain unpredictable "facts" of nature.
Thus, Mr. Finaglin's article represents a valuable addition to
the growing mass of scientific knowledge.
We are grateful to John W. Campbell, Jr., editor of
Astounding Science Fiction, for bringing this work to
our attention, and to the many readers of that magazine
who collected and contributed samples so that others
might share in their experience.
On Experiments
The first four laws are the only ones dignified by
number. Note the beauty and simplicity of the First
Law. Also note that the remaining three laws refer to
man's reactions to Nature—not to Nature itself.
First Law: If anything can go wrong with an experiment,
it will.
Second Law: No matter what result is anticipated, there
is always someone willing to fake it.
Third Law: No matter what the result, there is always
someone eager to misinterpret it.
Fourth Law: No matter what occurs, there is always
someone who believes it happened according to his
pet theory.
The Law of the Too Solid Goof
In any collection of data, the figure that is most
obviously correct—beyond all need of checking—is
the mistake.
Corollary /—No one whom you ask for help will see it,
either.
Corollaiy //—Everyone who steps by with unsought ad-
vice will see it immediately.
A further series of rules—or really advice to experi-
menters has been formulated. They are a natural conse-
quence of the first four laws reduced to day-to-day
practice.
Experiments must be reproducible—they should all
fail in the same way.
First draw your curves—then plot the readings.
Experience is directly proportional to equipment
ruined.
A record of data is useful—it indicates you've been
working.
To study a subject best, understand it thoroughly
before you start.
In case of doubt, make it sound convincing.
Do not believe in miracles—rely on them.
Always leave room to add an explanation when it
doesn't work. (This open-door policy is also known as
the Rule of the Way Out.)
Human Foibles
The remaining rules outline the human problems
that follow from the above. To some extent they repre-
sent man's reaction to Nature and, even more aptly,
man's reaction to man.
Laws of Revision (Often lumped into the Now Thev
Tell Us! Law):
First Law: Information necessitating a change of design
will be conveyed to the designer after—and only
alter—the plans are complete.
Corollary /—In simple cases, where one obvious right way
is opposed to one obvious wrong way. it is often
wiser to choose the wrong way right off. This is one
step ahead of choosing the right way, which turns
out to be a wrong way, which has to become a right
way.
Second Law: The more innocuous the revision appears
to be at first, the further its influence will extend
and more plans will have to be re-drawn.
Third Law: If, when the completion of a design is immi-
nent, field dimensions are finally supplied as they
actually are—instead of as they were meant to be—it
is always simpler to start all over.
30
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Fourth Law: Even if it is impossible to assemble a part
incorrectly, still a way will be found to do it wrong.
Corollary /—It is usually impractical to worry before-
hand about interferences—if you have none, some-
one will make one for you.
The Law of the Lost Inch:
In designing any type of construction, no overall
dimension can be totaled correctly after 4 p.m.
Friday.
Corollary /—Under the same conditions, if any minor
dimensions are given to 1/16 of an inch they cannot
be totaled at all.
Corollary //—The correct total will be self-evident at
9:01 Monday morning.
Deliveries that normally take one day will take five
when you are waiting.
When adjusting (or drawing or computing, etc.)
remember that the eye of the chief inspector (engineer,
draftsman, etc.) is more accurate than the finest instru-
ment.
After adding two weeks to a schedule for unexpected
delays, add two more weeks for the unexpected unex-
pected delays.
In any problem, if you find yourself doing an un-
ending amount of work, the answer may be obtained by
inspection.
Finagle's Creed:
Science is Truth—don't be misled by facts.
Finagle's Motto:
Smile—tomorrow it will be worse.
The Finagle Factor
A mathematical notation of Finagle's work has also
been developed. Here, however, there seems to be some
confusion, because two other names enter the picture:
fudge and diddle factors are also used to considerable
advantage by scientists and engineers.
Years ago—when the universe was relatively easy to
understand—the Finagle factor consisted of a simple ad-
ditive constant (sometimes known as a variable con-
stant) in the form:
x' = K,-f x
Where any measured variable, x, could be made to agree
with theory, x', by simple addition of the Finagle factor,
KP.
Later difficulties couldn't be solved so easily and so a
fudge factor KB, was added.
x — K.p —(— K.gX
Powerful as this adjustment was, World War II
studies in servo theory indicated a need for a still stron-
ger influence. The diddle factor, KD, was born and made
to multiply the quadratic term.
x' = Kp -f KBx + KlX2
It is felt that, at least at present, reality can be made
to conform to mathematical theory with reasonable
agreement on the basis of these three factors.
However, John W. Campbell feels there is a differ-
ent basic structure behind the Finagle, fudge and diddle
factors. The Finagle factor, he claims, is characterized by
changing the universe to fit an equation. The fudge
factor, on the other hand, changes the equation to fit the
universe. And finally, the diddle factor changes things
so that the equation and the universe appear to fit, with-
out making any real change in either.
For example, the planet Uranus was introduced to
the universe when Newtonian laws couldn't be made to
match known planetary motions. This is a beautiful
example of the application of the Finagle factor.
Einstein's work leading to relativity was strongly in-
fluenced by the observed factor about the orbit of Mer-
cury. Obviously a fudge factor was introduced.
The photographer's use of a "soft-focus" lens when
taking portraits of women over 35 is an example of the
diddle factor. By blurring the results, protographs are
made to appear to match the facts in a far more satis-
factory manner.
To our knowledge, this is the first clear enunciation
of the scientific method. All our vast sum of human
knowledge has been derived with these as the basic tools.
Having them in writing for the first time, perhaps our
children can build even better futures than the best we
envision today.

HOW CUTLER-HAMMER
CREATIVE ENGINEERING
HELPS INDUSTRY REACH
ITS AUTOMATION GOALS
Ralph Millermaster, vice president,
engineering and development, answers the questions
most frequently asked by students regarding
Cutler-Hammer's role in industrial automation
Q. How long has Cutler-Hammer
been in Automation?
A. Long before the word "auto-
mation" was coined.
Many company historians view
the installation of the first electric
turret-turning control for battle-
ships as our original "automatic
system" achievement. In 1904,
trials aboard the U.S.S. INDIANA
so improved rapid-fire and gunnery-
control scoring that identical sys-
tems were installed on sister ships.
Q. How does your Automation—
or "System Control"—effort
differ from your other control
business?
A. We work in two areas of control.
One involves research, develop-
ment and manufacture of stand-
ardized electric control components
and apparatus. Here the customer
orders from us through a bill of
material.
The automation customer is dif-
ferent. He has no bill of material
—he has a problem. He needs to
improve production or quality, or
to reduce his unit costs. He isn't
buying "hardware," he's seeking a
creative solution to a challenging
problem . . . and that's what our
engineers provide.
Q. Assuming I decide to work
for a control manufacturer, why
Cutler-Hammer?
A. The most compelling reason is
our continuing interest and exten-
sive experience in "System Con-
trol." This is the life of our com-
pany and distinct career advantages
result from this concern.
Our engineers are forced to apply
a combination of advanced elec-
tronic and electrical engineering
know-how to solve a customer's
manufacturing problem. They start
with a thorough grounding in the
customer's products — how he
moves and works the materials he
manufactures. Then they apply
their technical knowledge to create
a practical solution. We have a
Materials Handling group, a Metal
Processing group, and many other
industry groups composed of young,
creative-minded engineers.
And, we don't "stock-pile" our
engineering talent. Every engineer
we hire is expected to contribute
quickly and directly to the team
effort.
Q. How does Cutler-Hammer
approach an automation job?
A. We have learned that a sizable
system needs painstaking coordi-
nation between many groups —
project teams, engineering, mainte-
nance and purchasing personnel at
the customer factory and head-
quarters locations . . . machinery
builders, motor manufacturers,
contractors and many more.
We view this coordination as one
of our primary functions, and fulfill
it by furnishing all responsible
groups and individuals the infor-
mation they want and need to
guarantee an efficient dovetailing
of effort.
We organize a coordinating task
force for each project, headed by a
lead engineer and staffed by engi-
neers representing every necessary
technical discipline. That task force
is charged with three duties:
1. Create a system that will
solve the problem.
2. Design the system within the
time allotted.
3. Install the system at a cost
which pays its way for the
customer and provides us a
fair profit.
Task forces work together in a
modern 500,000 square foot plant
specifically designed to house every
activity involved in the evolution
of the complete system. Every pos-
sible step has been taken to provide
a climate that is conducive to
creative planning and development.
This approach has paid off! Long
recognized as a leader in standard-
ized motor control, Cutler-Hammer
is more and more being regarded
as a major contributor in industrial
automation. Our automation cre-
dentials include innovations in every
industrial field from continuous
process lines to newspaper mail
rooms.
Q. How do I learn more about
Cutler-Hammer's automation
capability and the career op-
portunities for engineers?
A. By visiting your Place-
ment Office . . . picking up the
Cutler-Hammer literature on the
rack, and talking to your Placement
Director. Or, you can write direct
to T. B. Jochem, Cutler-Hammer,
Milwaukee, Wisconsin, for a com-
plete kit of information. And, I
hope that you will plan to meet
with our representative when he
visits your campus.

Metallurgical Engineering is usually defined as that branch of engineering concerned with the production,
processing, and specification of metallic materials for industry. All the traditional engineering fields utilize
metals so metallurgists find themselves working with others on problems in electronic components, space applica-
tions, extremes in temperature such as containing plasmas to containing liquefied helium, developing nuclear
fuels, problems on surface structure for corrosion resistance, on problems of increasing metal production and
quality while at the same time decreasing costs, in developing new and improved methods of fabrication, casting,
joining, and welding.
Because of the large range and scope of the problems encountered by Metallurgical Engineers, their pro-

has developed, Interstate and primary superhigh-
ways in all parts of the country are being built with
advanced design DEEP-STRENGTH Asphalt pavement.
Already, more than 90% of America's paved roads and
streets are surfaced with Asphalt. And Asphalt pavements
have successfully kept America's wheels rolling since 1876.

How to make a double bond—The man
on the left joined our Synthetic Chemicals Division Softball
team season before last as an outfielder. The one in the middle
plays very little Softball.
He plays center on the
Synthetic Chemicals Divi-
sion basketball team. The
man on the right is well-
acquainted with both of
the other boys, since he
manages both the Softball
team and the basketball
team. In addition, he had
been asked to make l,4-diphenyl-l,3-butadiene.
The outfielder and the basketball center mentioned that they
had developed a new synthesis for olefins via a phosphonate
intermediate. Well, not exactly new but much faster, easier to
work, and better yielding than the prior art had afforded.
"Give," said the manager.
"Run the Michaelis-Arbuzov reaction and make some
diethyl benzylphosphonate," said the outfielder. "That's
(C;,H,0)2P(0)CH2C6H,. The benzyl group on it will hook on
exothermically to almost any aldehyde. The carbonyl oxygen

from the aldehyde and a proton from the benzyl come off,
and a double bond is formed. You have to run the reaction in
a strongly basic medium. The new wrinkle is to achieve the
alkalinity you need by
previously prepared
sodium methoxide, with
dimethylformamide as
your solvent."
"What happens," add-
ed the kibitzer, "is the
phosphonate reacts with
the NaOCH3 in an equi-
librium reaction to form
phosphonate carbanion, which then performs a nucleophilic
attack on the aldehyde carbon. For what you want to do, your
aldehyde would be C„H5CH = CHCHO. So you get a situation
like this where the redistribution of electrons leads to formation
of the new double bond and leaves sodium diethyl phosphate."
This colloquy has resulted not only in the availability of
I,4-Diphenyl-I,3-butadiene as Eastman 8543 but also of the
exceedingly helpful Diethyl Benzylphosphonate as Eastman 8559
and of a reprint of a short paper on the method for anybody
interested. ,\,.Y-Dimethylformamide is Eastman 5870. We forget
who won the ball game.

The Sun play—Neutrons aren't much good by them-
selves for exposing photographic materials. Yet a mere few
thousand thermal neutrons/mm2 can give decent photographic
images, such as might be useful for neutron radiography (read
the wine level inside a lead amphora), neutron diffraction pat-
terns, neutron flux measurements, etc. The topic of photo-
graphic detection of neutrons is too quiet for our liking. We
wish to have a little noise.
It is done by a triple play: thermal neutrons activate '"B to
emit alphas, which scintillate ZnS(Ag), which gives off visible
light that exposes the film. For sharper images at the expense
of longer exposure time, neutron fans use an activation tech-
nique involving an appreciable half-life. There are gadolinium,
which works by an n,v reaction at an optimum thickness of
.074", and dysprosium, which works by |8 decay at an optimum
thickness of .023". Such a neutron converter sheet is exposed
without the film and then quickly pulled out of the neutron
flux and put in contact with the film. Questions like "What
film?" are answered by Eastman Kodak Company, X-ray
Division, Rochester 4, N.Y.
A prominent role in all this has been played by a gentleman
named Kuan-Han Sun, who once worked for us before his
interest turned from non-silicate optical glasses to nucleonics.

him. Name was Laura McGillivray. Lovely gal.

How Scientists and Engineers
Work Together in Industry
Q. Dr. Suits, I've heard a good deal about the scope of your programs. Is your
research mostly in physics and electronics?
A. This is a common misconception. The work of the many laboratories of Gen-
eral Electric "covers the waterfront" in science and in advanced engineering tech-
nology. Some laboratories specialize in electronics research, others in atomic power,
space technology', polymer chemistry, jet engine technology, and so forth. Actually,
the largest single field represented by the more than 1000 Ph.D. researchers in
General Electric is chemistry.
Q. Is this research performed principally by people with Ph.D. degrees in
science?
A. General Electric research covers a broad spectrum of basic and applied work.
At the Research Laboratory we focus largely on basic scientific investigations, much
as in a university, and most of the researchers are Ph.D.'s. In other Company
laboratories, where the focus is on applied science and advanced engineering, engi-
neers and scientists with B.S. and M.S. degrees predominate. Formal college training
is an important preparation for research, but research aptitudes, and especially
creative abilities, are also very important qualities.
Q. What are the opportunities for engineers in industrial scientific research
and how do scientists and engineers work together in General Electric?
A. Classically, engineers have been concerned with the problem "how," and
scientists with the question "why." This is still true, in general, although in ad-
vanced development and in technological work scientists and engineers work
hand-in-hand. Very close cooperation takes place, especially in the increasingly
important fields of new materials, processes, and systems. Certainly in General
Electric, a person's interest in particular kinds of problems and his ability to solve
them are more important than the college degree that he holds.
Q. What does it mean to an engineer to have the support of a large scientific
research effort?
A. It means that the engineer has ready access to the constant stream of new
concepts, new materials, and new processes that originate in research, and which
may aid his effort to solve practical problems. Contact with research thus provides
a "window" on new scientific developments—world-wide.
Q. How does General Electric go about hiring engineers and scientists?
A. During each academic year, highly qualified technical people from General
Electric make recruiting visits to most college campuses. These men represent
more than 100 General Electric departments and can discuss the breadth of G.E.'s
engineering and science opportunities with the students. They try to match the
interests of students and the Company, and then arrange interview visits. The
result of this system is a breadth of opportunity within one company which is
remarkable.
Experienced technical people are always welcome, and they are usually put in
contact with a specific Company group. Where no apparent match of interests exists,
referrals are made throughout General Electric. In all cases, one finds technical
men talking to technical men in a really professional atmosphere.
Q. Are there training programs in research for which engineering students
might be qualified?
A. There certainly are. Our 2-year Research Training Program at the General
Electric Research Laboratory gives young scientists a chance to work with ex-
perienced industrial research scientists before carrying out research and develop-
ment on their own.
In addition, there are seven Company-wide training programs. Those that attract
the largest number of technical graduates are the Engineering and Science,
Technical Marketing, and Manufacturing Training Programs. Each includes on-the-
job experience supplemented by a formal study curriculum.
Of course, not all graduates are hired for training programs. In many cases,
individuals are placed directly into permanent positions for which they are suited
by ability and interest.

When a transistor performs like this on a curve tracer,
we like to know why. Sometimes the answer is obvious.
Then again, we may find it not so easily explained. This
our semiconductor device people like. They enjoy sinking
their teeth into a knotty problem and sticking with it till
they shake out the answer—and it usually doesn't take long
at Delco.
Why? Easy.
When you toss a problem to a group of talented men
. .. provide the necessary research tools ... in an environ-
ment that encourages personal initiative and achievement
. . . you can't help getting results. This combination has
helped build a position of leadership for Delco in the de-
velopment and production of semi-conductor devices.
We intend to keep it that way—through expanding
facilities and fresh talent.
Our new R&amp;D center—125,000 sq. ft.—houses labora-
tories equipped with the latest in sophisticated research
facilities. Our new semiconductor manufacturing center—
226,000 sq. ft.—scheduled for operation this June, will pro-
vide an expanded capability in the production of silicon
rectifiers. All of which adds up to new opportunities in
research, development and production of silicon rectifiers.

CORPORATION WITH
AN INTERNATIONAL
VIEWPOINT
Facts bearing on professional careers at ITT
answering questions frequently asked us by college seniors
A MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR TO
U.S. DEFENSE
The largest American-owned inter-
national enterprise engaged in all as-
pects of electronic and telecommunica-
tion systems. International Telephone
and Telegraph Corporation operates
both domestic and foreign divisions
and subsidiaries. Among its nine prin-
cipal U.S. engineering/scientific organ-
izations, four are engaged in advanced
work for the Armed Forces and NASA.
Programs include:
large scale computer-based command/
control systems □ global communica-
tions systems (line of sight, tropo
scatter, lunar bounce, digital, telecom-
munications) □ ICBM base communi-
cations and control systems □ satel-
lite control &amp; communication systems
□ engineering support for large scale
warning systems □ antisubmarine
warfare systems □ electronic counter-
measures □ tactical military air navi-
gation systems □ ground support &amp;
environmental test systems □ infrared
detection &amp; guidance systems □
atomic clocks □ systems manage-
ment: world-wide, local.
DEEP IN DIVERSIFIED U.S.
COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISES
Prominent among ITT's domestic
commercial products is a new, high-
speed digital communication system
for large industrial Arms. ITT in the
U. S. also develops and manufactures
a vast variety of radio equipments and
systems, automatic programmers, tele-
printers, telephone equipment, infra-
red image converters, image storage
and intensifier tubes, high resolution
scanners, twt's, coaxial cables and
other products.
Today, no less than 53 plants and fa-
cilities are operated by 16 ITT divi-
sions or subsidiaries in the United
States. Their combined income
amounts to roughly 40% of the total
figure for the world-wide operations
of the parent corporation, whose re-
sources stand solidly behind each op-
eration, at home and abroad.
ITT IN RESEARCH A
DEVELOPMENT ENGINEERING
Basic and applied investigations re-
late to both military and commercial
programs. Extensive R&amp;D facilities
are provided. To cite one example,
ITT's own "Space Communications
Research Station," erected in Nutley,
N. J., was selected by NASA as one
of the ground terminals for the Proj-
ect Relay experimental satellite com-
munication system.
A PIONEER IN SYSTEMS
ENGINEERING
ITT's long experience in the operation
of world-wide communication systems
has made it a logical choice for both
systems development and systems
management contracts awarded by the
Armed Forces. Examples are:
Systems development, design and
management of the vast SAC global
command/control system 465-L □
Coordination and management of the
10 year program to expand and mod-
ernize AIR COM, global communica-
tions system of the U. S. Air Force.
GLOBAL PRACTITIONER OF
FIELD ENGINEERING
In the Arctic, in the Tropics, on land,
afloat, or undersea, ITT skills in on-
site engineering for every kind of
communication or large scale elec-
tronic system have been thoroughly
tested. It is equipped to provide com-
plete engineering support anywhere
in the free world. This includes in-
stallation, operation, maintenance,
evaluation and continuous modern-
ization, as assignments may require.
ITT's responsibilities in field and ap-
plications engineering include:
operation, maintenance and testing of
Pacific Missile Range facilities for the
U. S. Navy □ engineering support, in-
stallation and maintenance for a
global digital command and control
system for SAC □ tropo scatter com-
munication systems spanning nations
in Europe and Asia □ 6,000 miles of
advanced radar and communications
equipment on DEWLINE.
UNIQUE INTERNATIONAL
RESOURCES FOR
PROFESSIONAL ENRICHMENT
ITT foreign affiliates and subsidiaries
operate public telephone systems in
19 countries. In addition, more than
12 overseas laboratories have made
many significant advances in commu-
nications technology. Technical
papers and progress reports steadily
circulate among R&amp;D people both at
home and abroad, and leading ITT
scientists and engineers participate in
international seminars conducted an-
nually by the company.

In chain-drag test, truck raises
heavy dust clouds to check air filter efficiency.
Results: Up to 30,000 miles between filter changes in Ford-built cars for '63!
The 1963 Ford-built cars you see on the road these days can
eat dust and keep coming back for more, thanks to improved
carburetor air filters.
In our continuing quest to build total quality and service-
saving features into Ford-built cars, our engineering research
staff explored the entire field of physical chemistry for new
air-purifying properties in materials.
The result: a filtering material made of chemically treated
wood pulp and paper that permits Ford-built cars under
normal operation to go from 24,000 to 30,000 miles before
carburetor air filter replacement is required.
The new, tougher filter paper is accordion folded to increase
surface area four-fold, permitting higher filtration in a smaller
package. The more matter it accumulates, the better it filters
right up to its full rated service life. It saves owners time and
money. It keeps Ford-built engines livelier longer.

Politics: People shy away from it, because it brings to
mind the connation of something behind the scenes, like
secret deals and payoffs.
Communications, in this modern world, are such that
above connotation holds little weight, yet politics is one of
the most important facets of the real world.
Politics and politicians, our elected representatives and
leaders, formulate the laws and policies of our governments.
These laws and policies affect both individuals and groups
in many diverse ways, such as taxing and financial aid, re-
striction of some activities and encouragement of others.
An outsider would think that the people would show
their vested interest by voting. Yet it is rare when 60 per
cent of the eligible voters go to the polls. But even more
disheartening is the greater lack of interest in the basic issues
and philosophies of the political parties.
The United States has the advantage of a two-party
system, eliminating the bad effects of constantly changing
coalition governments.
Many people vote Republican or Democratic because
their parents and friends did. Just as bad, is the voter who
prides himself on never voting a straight ticket. "I always
vote for the man," he says. This person votes on personality.
The people need to compare the issues and philosophy
of each party with their own and vote for the party whose
views most closely coinside with his own.
People gripe when a law adversely affects them, but
if they had studied the issues, they might have voted differ-
ently themselves.

Some newspapers are to be commended for running a
box score of congressional voting on important legislation.
This might be of interest to those who only read the sports
section of the newspapers.
All of our Presidents have been career politicians pri-
marily lawyers), or famous generals. There may be a trend
toward the businessman in the executive branches of our
government. Witness the election of industrialists Romney
and Scranton to the governorship in Michigan and Pennsyl-
vania. Government is big business, and business executives
are well equipped to handle the diverse and complex prob-
lems that occur. It is a trend that bears watching.

Point to ponder: Aside from conspiracy, Billy Sol Estes
merely applied the philosophy of the federal government
to his private business—"Permanent deficit financing."

This is my last issue as Editor-in-Chief of the Technic.
As I prepare to enter graduate school and the business world,
I can look back on my four and one-half years on the
Technic staff and know that these experiences have prepared
me, in a way that cannot be achieved through textbooks, for
the real world. Some of these experiences have been painful,
though most were pleasant. If I had it to do over, I most
certainly would follow the same choice!

ever at Bethlehem Steel!
What has Bethlehem Steel been doing lately?
. . . designing and building nuclear-powered naval vessels
. . . moved into new research laboratories unexcelled by those of any industry
. . . building new mills, the last word in steelmaking technology
. . . fabricating and erecting steelwork for the nation's great structures
Bethlehem Steel is one of the largest
steel producers . .. one of the larg-
est industrial corporations ... one
of the largest structural steel fabri-
cating and erecting operations .. .
and the largest privately owned
shipbuilding and ship repair or-
ganization.

But mere size is only a part of the
story. Throughout Bethlehem Steel
the key word is new. New facilities,
new products, new ways of doing
things—exciting new developments
providing rewarding careers for
able and energetic young men who
join this organization through the
Loop Course.
What is the Loop Course?
The Loop Course is our program
designed specifically to train men
for management careers. New loop-

ers report to our general head-
quarters in Bethlehem, Pa., early
in July. They attend a basic course
of five weeks, including talks and
discussions by top Company offi-
cials, educational films, and daily
plant visits (this circuit, or "loop"
through a steel plant, is what gave
the course its name). The Loop
Course is not a probationary period.
After completion of the basic
course, every looper receives his
first assignment, whereupon he
goes through another, more spe-
cialized, training course before be-
ginning actual on-the-job training.
Loopers are Career Men
We select qualified men for the
Loop Course on the basis of their
potential for careers in manage-
ment. In most years we enroll over
a hundred graduating seniors, most

The life sciences group at The Garrett Corporation is con-
cerned with the reaction of living organisms to their environ-
ment, and the development of environmental systems to
support such organisms.
Intensive investigation is now being conducted at Carrett
in all major areas of the life sciences —microbiology, neuro-
physiology, psychology, biochemistry, biophysics and related
areas—to study the relationships of man to his environment
in extended space travel. These studies vary in scope from
determining the effects of near vacuum conditions on labora-
tory subjects over long periods of time, to definitively eval-
uating the effects of re-entry acceleration on human beings.
Garrett also designs, develops and manufactures environ-
mental control systems for this country's major manned
spaceflight programs, including Project Mercury, Gemini
and Apollo.

in the wheel have played a major
role in boosting horsepower as
much as 63% in development en-
gines. These air-cooled blades
operate in higher inlet gas tempera-
tures with a lower blade surface
temperature than uncooled blades,
making possible improved fuel con-
sumption as well as increased
horsepower output.


THE ENERGY CONVERSION DIVISION OF

• ADVANCED TURBINE ENGINE DEVELOPMENT—Allison,
world leader in the design, development and production of turbo prop
engines, is extending their capabilities to meet changing military needs.
Current programs greatly advancing the state of the art include
developments for V/STOL applications and programs to maximize fuel
economy and range through air cooled turbines and high temperature
regenerative cycles.
And, in other fields, first and second stage rocket engine cases designed
and produced by Allison for Minuteman have achieved a 100 per cent
reliability record. Allison's steadily growing competence in the field
is reflected in the forward strides made in titanium and glass filament-wound
ICBM cases. Also, Allison has developed a highly efficient regenerative
liquid metal cell that may point the way to a powerful, yet compact,
electrical system for space-age applications.
Atomic Energy Commission's announcement of negotiations with Allison
as prime contractor for development of MCR (Military Compact Reactor)
also creates long-range opportunities in the nuclear field. Perhaps there's
a place for you in the creative environment at Allison. Talk to our
representative when he visits your campus. Let him tell you first-hand

Ship designers have always tried to de-
sign their hulls for minimum water re-
sistance. Intuitively, it would seem that
the more streamlined the hull shape, the
less resistance. Yet, recent experiments,
along with some theory, indicate a bul-
bous hull shape may actually have less
resistance than a streamlined one.
The problem of ship wave-making
resistance has long been a source of
fascination and concern for experi-
menters with ship hull forms. Since
the time of William Fronde's experi-
ments in his towing tank built at
Torquay, England in 1870, this issue
has been the subject of many mathe-
matical and physical arguments which
often operate exclusively many levels
above the one corresponding to prac-
tical application. In many respects,
there are excellent reasons for this
fact of history, for a water borne ves-
sel moving upon the surface repre-
sents one of the most complex prob-
lems of hydrodynamics.
The crux of this matter involves
the presence of the free surface. Com-
pletely discounting the difficulties
arising from the behavior of a tossing
vessel in wind-driven surface waves,
the mere fact that a ship operates at
the interface of two fluids vastly
different in density and in other
hydrodynamic properties brings in
many highly complicated considera-
tions. It is one matter to devise math-
ematical models for bodies in motion
in one continuous fluid, and yet quite
another to derive methods of treat-
ing the boundary conditions of a free
surface, and to solve for the pressure
variations along some body moving
through this interface of two fluidv
Surface or gravity waves are produced
by the motion of a vessel piercing the
free surface and are formed in accord-
ance with the pressure distributions
associated with the shape and speed
of the particular hull. These surface
waves represent energy placed into

hull. This idea is simple enough, for
it is clear that the surface wavetrain
systems maintained by a moving ves-
sel carry away both kinetic and poten-
tial energy supplied by the ship's
power plant to sustain steady velocity
of the vessel. Since it is the quantity
of resistance that much research work
attempts to reduce ... or at least
tries to understand and predict with
some accuracy, the importance of the
problem of wave-making is obvious.
Little can be done with the frictional
or viscous aspect of resistance since
this component is basically a function
of the wetted surface and not of hull
shape.

velopment of an interesting blend of
theory and its application for the pur-
pose of successful reduction of wave-
making resistance. Recent Japanese
efforts with so-called bulbous hull
forms have led to some very positive
results with respect to the wave-mak-
ing characteristics of displacement
surface ships. Most of this recent
work has been conducted in the Ex-
perimental Towing Tank at the Uni-
versity of Tokyo by some fine research
people there. Due to the interest in
these efforts displayed by the Univer-
sity of Michigan Department of Naval
Architecture and by the Martime Ad-
ministration, one of these eminent
experimenters is presently at this
University as a visiting professor—Dr.
Tetsuo Takahei of the University of
Ibaraki. During his stay here, several
of the experiments involved with his
work with a theoretical "waveless-
hull form" are being repeated in the
Michigan facility with 12 foot models
in order to make comparisons with
those results from Tokya using 8.2
foot models. It is from the fine wrork
of a number of Japanese researchers

information and encouragement.

creases in wave-making resistance.
The purpose of placing the aspect of
the practical application first in this
article is to demonstrate that in an
engineering sense, the ideas and prin-
ciples involved with the theory are
not merely restricted to significant
paper-bound results, but also have
real merit in the world of actual de-
vices.
The second section deals with some
general and basically intuitive con-
cepts of the theory of bulbs and of
"waveless-hull forms." It is an at-
tempt to explain in some detail the
pertinent principles important to the
results shown in the first section.
Practical Aspects
Full Scale Test
The large photography displayed
at the outset of this article demon-
strates in a singularly pictorial way
the nature of the phenomenon that
is under consideration. A Japanese
coastal passenger ship, the Kurenai
Maru, was fitted with a large bulbous
bow of that type found to give excel-
lent results in towing tank tests.
It is sufficient, at this point, to in-
dicate that the mechanism by which
the magnitude of wave-making resist-
ance was reduced while using a bul-
bous form involved the nearly com-
plete cancellation of the bow wave
of the ship when the vessel was oper-
ating at design speed. Cancellation
of a wavetrain system implies that
the waves created by the bulb be
approximately of the same amplitude
but exactly out of phase with the
wave system normally created by the
ship's bare hull. In words, this is the
essence of the idea behind the use of
bulbous hull forms. The later section
of the article will deal with the the-
oretical basis for this remarkable in-
terference and cancellation effect.
Recalling what was mentioned before,
it should be evident that upon cancel-
lation of say the bow wave system, the
loss of energy normally represented in
those waves will no longer be incur-
red, and the associated wave-making
resistance will be lessened by that
amount.

parison of wave patterns of the

form operating at the same speed.
There is a distinct absence of a
bow wave pattern and an apparent
reduction in general disturbances
around the bow of the former vessel
lower ship in the picture). This
characterizes the physical effect of
bulb wave interference.
The importance of this phenome-
non is contained in the fact that wave
system cancellation occurs, but per-
haps, even more significant is the
effect that this result has on the
power requirements of the vessel and
hence on the cost of operation. Now,
the matter becomes one of real prac-
tical importance, and in this manner
strikes home to a vital concern of en-
gineering efforts all over the world:
economy. The plot of measured Brake
Horsepower versus speed on the in-
cluded graph for the actual test of
the Kurenai Maru points up the
strength of many of the theoretical
arguments concerning the virtues of
"waveless" hull forms.
One should realize that the Kure-
nai Maru tests displayed wave in-
terference and cancellation against
only one of four main wave-train
systems associated with a conven-
tional ship hull form. The stern
and shoulder waves are still very
much present and must obviously
affect the resistence of the vessel.
Nevertheless, the successful cancella-
tion of the bow wave brought about
a 13% decrease in total power re-
quirements for that particular ship at
design speed. This is a substantial
figure considering that most hull form
research today deals in proposed im-
provements of around 1 to 5% in
the characteristic power curves. Other
tests in Japan with conventional hop
form models have shown reductions
even greater than this example.
Tank Tests at Michigan
The full scale testing of the
Kurenai Maru took place in Japan
in 1961. It is interesting to note that
careful model testing at the Tokyo
Tank preceded all of those full size
experiments. As a matter of fact, it
is to the accuracy of the model test
series that the full scale experiment
owes its success. This indicates in
some way the importance of the tow-
ing tank phase of research work with
hull forms.
Recently in this country, at the
University of Michigan Towing Tank
facilities, work has been going on with
models of a number of types of ships
fitted with bow bulbs. The design of
these bulbs for each of the projects
has been carried out by Professor
Takahei. Two of these vessel types
are of interest here because they are
conventional ship forms and illustrate
the effectiveness of the bulb wave
interference concept as it operates on
a practical basis. Only brief descrip-
tions will be included here since one
of the models was tested in the tank
under commercial contract and the
other was for a study done for the
U.S. Navy.

ic research ship was sent to the Uni-
versity to be tested. This design had

BETWEEN THE
PLANETS
by Martin Tanenhaus
As space voyages become longer, space
vehicles will need dependable auxiliary
power sources for instrumentation, com-
munication , and human sustenance. Exist-
ing power systems will have to undergo
major changes to become suitable.
Xuclear, chemical, cryogenic, and mag-
netohydrodynamic systems are currently
in the spotlight for these applications.
Future earth satellites, vehicles for
lunar and interplanetary exploration,
and lunar and space stations will re-
quire power systems for attitude con-
trol, instrumentation, communica-
tions, and human sustenance. In gen-
eral, chemical, nuclear or solar systems
will be able to fulfill the early re-
quirement for these projects. But,
with an increase in power require-
ments and the number of space mis-
sions, the design concepts of applica-
ble space power systems will change.
The major changes in design will be:
1. Development of high power, low
weight systems.
2. Production of systems which
can operate continuously for as
long as two years.
$. Improvement of production cap-
ability to reduce costs.
Generally, attitude control and in-
strumentation will require less than
1000 watts. Communication require-
ments will be in the kilowatt range,
and up to 1.5 kilowatts per man will
be needed for continuous regenera-
tion life sustenance systems. The ulti-
mate goal, therefore, is a compact,
lightweight, self-contained system
with long life and high reliability.
NUCLEAR
Direct and indirect nuclear reac-
tor cycles have been under study for
some time. In the direct cycle, the fis-
sionable material is placed in direct
contact with the thermionic emitter
surface in the reactor core. The cur-
rent is thus obtained directly from
the reactor core. An external cooling
circuit is required to carry away the
heat deposited at the collector.
In the indirect cycle, liquid metal
with a high boiling point is circulated
through the core of a nuclear reactor
which may be extremely small. The
reactor heat is then delivered by the
liquid metal to external thermionic
converter elements.
Between .5 and 60 kw, power
can be furnished by a system of zir-
conium-hydride reactors fueled with
fully enriched uranium and cooled by
liquid sodium-potassium. These reac-
tor energy sources are designed to
operate at up to 1300° F. coolant in-
let temperature.
Basically, two reactors will furnish
power in this range with modifica-
tions in control systems to compensate
for variations in fuel burn-up. Ener-
gy conversion will be static thermo-
electric and turboelectric.
Development of the 500 watt Snap-
10A, a recactor with fixed controls
and energy conversion by means of
thermoelectric germanium-silicon al-
loy, is proceeding on a schedule that
will permit its flight testing in 1966.
The reactor, its energy conversion
equipment, and shield, are expected
to weigh about 800 pounds. Approxi-
mately 65 sq. ft. of radiator area will
operate well within the temperature
and material limits of both reactor
and thermoelectric converter, and
promises to have reasonably good re-
liability.
The 300 watt Snap-2 system uses a
reactor identical to Snap-lOA's but
with automatic controls. The heat en-
ergy available at 1200° F. will be con-
verted to electricity by a mercury
vapor Rankine cycle unit. All of the
rotating components, mercury and
sodium-potassium pumps, turbine, al-
ternator, and mercury bearings, are
mounted on a single shaft. Exhaust
mercury will be condensed in a radia-
tor condenser of 100 sq. ft. area. The
total weight of this system including
the shield is expected to be about
1,000 pounds. Flight tests for the sys-
tem are expected to begin in 1965.
The 30 kw Snap-8 system will have
a growth capability to 60 kw. The re-
actor is slightly larger than the Snap-
2 or Snap-lOA, having 211 fuel ele-
ments instead of 37. Its inlet tempera-
ture is the highest of the family of
nuclear systems—1300° F. Basically,
the turboelectric system is the same as
Snap-2's, but operates at slightly high-
er temperature.
Plans lor development of a 300 kw
to 1 Mw dynamic space power sys-
tem were clarified in September. The
design objectives include a specific
weight of 10 pounds/kw (unshielded,
but includes the reactor, conversion
unit and heat rejection radiator) and
unattended operation for a period of
10.000 hours.

TEACHING MACHINES:
THEORY AND PR)
20
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


TICE
by David Patt
One of the primary motives behind
man's efforts to understand natural phe-
nomena is the desire to apply these phe-
nomena for his benefit. In order to do
this, understanding must lead to the
ability to predict. Yet, there are some
phenomena which we would like to con-
trol but we lack knoxvledge adequate to
be able to predict their course. In this
case, we can resort to empirical means to
enable us to predict without understand-
ing. The human brain is a complex "phe-
nomenon" about which we understand
relatively little. However, with a little
theory and much empiricism, psycholo-
gists have constructed machines which
control the learning function of the brain.
In the last fifty years, much has
been written about the logic and phil-
osophy of science and scientific prog-
ress. The bulk of these works ap-
peared immediately after the initial,
developmental stages of all of today's
prominent natural sciences (with one
important exception which will be-
come apparent). Thus, these dieories
of science represent hindsight and
not foresight. Consequently, the devel-
opment of Astronomy, Chemistry,
and Physics was not affected by
this thought. Yet, it seems obvious
that a clear understanding by the
workers in a given scientific field of
the philosophy of science, would
greatly facilitate initial progress in
the particular field. Thus, the fol-
lowing paragraphs are far from super-
fluous in a discussion of "teaching
Machines."
It is a moot question as to whether
or not scientific knowledge is brought
to light by curiosity only (the pure
scientist) or because society needs or
desires applications of this knowl-
edge (the classic engineering ap-
proach). It is not necessary to answer
this question absolutely—nor is it
possible—in order to realize that in
the past, applications of chemical and
physical principles (engineering) has
often preceded theoretical knowl-
edge. In fact, this is a classical pattern
of scientific development.
For example, the behavior of struc-
tural members (beams) under load,
has always been a vital question. The
prediction of this behavior was nec-
essary in order to successfully con-
struct bridges, buildings, and ships.
There were two obvious ways to
achieve this prediction: theoretically
or empirically. However, there were
no theoretical, material physicists
handy at the time the result would
have to be achieved empirically if it
was to be achieved at all. In other
words, the behavior couldn't be ex-
plained, but it might be described.
Beams were tested under varied con-
ditions. Their behavior was studied
as a function of length, width, and
composition. An equation with em-
pirical form and with empirical con-
stants was "made" to the data, and
engineers were able to predict (and
therefore, control) the behavior of
beams to any desired accuracy with-
out explaining it. Recently, molecular
research has yielded a partial explana-
tion of this behavior.
There exists today, an analogous
situation. This is the relation be-
tween the science of psychology and
one of its applications: teaching ma-
chines. It is almost unnecessary to
state that we face an educational
crisis; our educational system has
been described as inefficient, expen-
sive, and ineffective in a large num-
ber of instances, but most important
is the stark fact that it is failing to
meet the educational needs of today's
society. It would be attractive to em-
ploy psychology, the study of be-
havior and therefore, learning, to ex-
plain learning and on the basis of this
explanation, to deduce how to teach
most efficiently. However, present psy-
chological theory is unable to explain
learning. Yet, it is claimed that ma-
chines which can teach have been
constructed. Could it be that teaching
machines are psychology's "beams"?
Is it possible that psychologists can
describe, and as a consequence of de-
scription, control learning without
actually explaining it? The answer is
yes; and I would like to pursue the
beams-materials physics, teaching ma-
chines-psychology analogy throughout
this discussion as an aid to clarity in
describing the theoretical and practi-
cal implications of teaching machines.
Developing the "Learning Equation"
In order to keep teaching machine
"theory" and application in its proper
perspective, let us see how closely we
can stick with the above analogy.
First, it is clear that society needs to
learn how to control the learning
process. If the analogy holds, the first
thing we must do is describe the
learning process as a function of cer-
tain variables (actually, this step ap-
plies to any empirical approach). The
analogous process with beams was
fairly simple: they were just loaded
under different conditions and the

run into an unexpected complication.
Before we can study it, we must de-
cide what we mean by the term
"learning." Educators talk about such
concepts as understanding or grasp-
ing. One has "learned" a subject
when he has grasped it or when he
understands it. There is, however, no
existing way to look into a student's
brain and objectively decide that he
understands something. Thus, learn-
ing must be inferred from some ob-
servable evidence. What evidence do
we refer to when we say someone has
learned something? Almost always, it
is performance on some kind of a
written or verbal test (class participa-
tion, exams, papers, etc.) Learning is
inferred from operant or verbal be-
havior, (verbal behavior can be oper-
ant behavior). It seems clear, then,
that we should define "teaching" as
causing one to reliably emit the prop-
er response or verbal behavior asso-
ciated with some question, statement,
or problem. The definition for learn-
ing follows directly: if one repeatedly
makes the proper response, he has
"learned."
Now we can begin to construct our
descriptive "equation" of learning
from which we hope we will eventual-
ly be able to deduce a method of con-
trolling this learning. For practical
reasons it is much easier to study
learning in laboratory animals such
as pigeons and rats than in human
beings, so this is what was done. (We
will consider transfer of these studies
to human learning later.) It would be
a waste of time to talk about specific
experiments since the results are the
primary object of interest. The fol-
lowing factors represent the consen-
sus of opinion of two prominent
workers in the field, B. F. Skinner,
and James G. Holland, and with one
exception, which I will mention later,
the general consensus. Learning be-
havior is influenced by: 1) immediate
reinforcement 2) the frequency of
emission of this behavior 3) rate of
progression in establishing a complex
repertoir of behavior 4) "fading" 5)
observational or attentional behavior
6) "descrimination" training. First,
definitions are in order, and then dis-
cussion.
Reinforcements are, simply, the
consequences of behavior. They
might loosely be thought of as re-
wards or punishments. For example,
food is an effective reinforcement for
laboratory animals.
The frequency of emission is
straight forward. The rate of learning
is affected by the occurance of learn-
ing behavior.
The rate of progression is a func-
tion of the number of steps employed
in establishing a given "amount" of
behavior. For instance, before a first
grader can learn to multiply, he must
take the "giant step" of learning to
add. The learning of addition could
be further broken down into smaller
steps. This is often referred to as
shaping and is really a type of succes-
sive approximation process.
Fading is another form of progres-
sion. It involves the withdrawal of
supporting stimuli. For instance, a
child might be shown a fully labeled
map. Next, the same map might be
presented with one or two names
omitted and the child would supply
the missing labels. Eventually, he
might be expected to re-construct the
whole map.
Observational behavior is intui-
tively obvious. One must pay atten-
tion or observe in order to learn.
Learning, in many instances, de-
pends on the ability to descriminate.
That is, the ability to select or recog-
nize the important or significant
property of an object or statement or
problem.
We now know the general form of
our learning equation. Learning
equals some function of the six prev-
iously mentioned variables. It re-
mains to find the "coefficients" of this
equation. Unfortunately, in the gen-
eral case, these coefficients turn out to
be much less specific than the form
of the equation, but their very lack
of specificity will lead to the idea of
feedback and a discussion of this very
important feature of teaching ma-
chines.
In general, the more quickly rein-
forcement follows behavior, the great-
er the effect of the reinforcement.
Also, frequent emission of learning
behavior provides the opportunity for
frequent reinforcement and results in
more efficient learning. B. F. Skinner
originally claimed that the smaller
the steps in shaping the behavior, the
better. However, it now appears that
their is an optimal sue for the steps
which depends on the situation. Fad-
ing also falls in the category of having
an optimal rate which depends on
the situation. It seems clear that the
more acute the observation or the
more closely attention is given to a
subject, the better this subject will be
learned. And of course, the ability to
descriminate is essential in determin-
ing the correct verbal response.
Thus, through laboratory experi-
ments with animals, we have "made"
an approximate equation to describe
learning.
Transfer of Principles to Human Beings
Now comes the question of wheth-
er or not we can validly transfer the
above principles to human beings.
First, in all the experiments, the spe-
cies has made little difference in the
results; secondly, a small number of
experiments with human beings seem
to indicate that the same general
principles apply to human learning;
and thirdly, since the coefficients of
the learning equation are fairly un-
specific anyway, we can introduce the
compensating idea of feedback. As we
shall see, this gives us a strong start-
ing point in applying these principles
of learning to human beings. Only
one more problem remains: food is
neither an effective nor practical re-
inforcement in most human learning
situations and suitable reinforcements
for humans must be found. Experi-
ments have shown that being right
and being able to manipulate en-
vironment (even operating a teaching
machine) are powerful reinforcements
for civili/etl humans.
The Generalized Teaching Machine
In a general way, we are now able
to describe human learning as a func-
tion of certain variables. To continue
following the beam analogy, we
should now search for the most effi-
cient way to control and maintain
that combination of variables which
are most advantageous to human
learning. This is essentially the job of
the teaching machine. It is a mechani-
cal and or electrical device which sub-
jects the student to the optimal com-
bination of learning variables.
The best description of the gen-
eralized teaching machine is the
following which was proposed by Dr.
Rothkopf of the Bell Telephone
Laboratories. The machine consists
of the following functional com-
ponents: 1) the program storage.
This may range from a box of flash-
cards to a role of magnetic tape. 2)
the problem selector, which initiates
the next step in the program. This
may range from a simple lever to the

tion chamber fitted at the bow and
protruding below the base line of the
vessel. It seemed to be a natural for
the proposal of utilizing a bulbous
form whose design could serve the
dual purpose of the chamber and a
wave cancellation device as well. In
the consideration of the bulb design,
it turned out that the general hull
configuration was similar to the
Kurenai Baru's; hence, the bulb
shape was also of like design to that
used in the full scale tests in Japan.
From the subsequent model test series
conducted in the Michigan tank, defi-
nitely favorable results were derived
from the bulb wave-interference effect.
Third and last among the examples
of conventional hull applications to
be included here is just the mention
of an interesting series of tests which
the Michigan Ship Hydrodynamics
lab performed for the U.S. Navy. Pro-
posals had been made to design a
large bulb to be placed on a model
hull of one of the Navy's high speed
displacement ships—the idea being
to seek further speed benefits from
wave interference and cancellation as
part of an intergrated hull design.
These proposals were accepted and
the work proceeded with a number
of bulb designs being produced by
Dr. Takahei in an effort to optimize
the action of the bulb. Dealing with
the extremely fair and slender shape
of this high speed ship introduced
many problems of the bulb design
which had to be solved through a
certain amount of trial and error.
Since the "state of the theory" at the
present does not permit an accurate
approximation to a conventional hull
form by a mathematical stream sur-
face, most work with bulbs, relies
upon extrapolation or interpolation
of results from the mathematical hull
forms .... or from experience gained
with other conventional hulls.
At any rate, a measure of success
was actually achieved with that ship
form with respect to its wave-making
properties. Two conditions of the
ship under way in the Michigan Tow-
ing Tank are shown in the photo-
graph— without and with the bulb
form fitted to the main hull. Space
does not allow a further discussion of
the Navy ship results nor those from
the oceanographic ship tests.
Theoretical Aspects
Thus far the discussion of the sub-
ject of bulbous hull forms has been
limited to a few of the results from
the conventional hull, full scale test
or from model tests of various types
of vessels. It should be emphasized
that activities in this area of practical
research comprise only a fraction of
the effort expended to date on the
concepts of wave interference and
cancellation by using bulbous forms.
Most of the really significant work
has been accomplished in the realm
of the theoretical analysis of mathe-
matical hulls—revised and improved
approximation to the free surface and
boundary conditions, and the proper
mathematical designation of the bulb
form and the cancellation effect. This
is to say that all of the general results
and ideas discussed up to now in this
article have firm foundations in the
remarkable theory of wave-making
resistance as it has been studied and
developed recently in Japan. Like all
efforts in highly mathematical areas
of study, of course, this recent work
builds on that of the giants of the
earlier theory.
This second section, then, proposes
to take a glance at the tools by which
one studies the phenomenon of wave
making and of bulb-wave interference
against the hull wave systems. The

tail. The idea in this treatment is to
stress the intuitive aspects of the im-
portant equations and to put forth
the physical feeling for the mechan-
isms involved.
The Main Hull Form
Let us first consider the main hull
of a displacement ship and the meth-
od for representing this form theo-
retically. Historically, this problem
alone has been an area of much activ-
ity and concern. Strictly speaking, it
still remains unsolved in the complete
sense. The particular approximation
developed by the recent Japanese
efforts is the one discussed here.
The basic idea or concept of des-
cribing a body in motion in a station-
ary fluid (or a body at rest in a
stream flowing past it) is to derive
what is referred to as a stream surface
which can be obtained mathematical-
ly—either with an exact solution or
by means of some numerical method.
Working toward a mathematical hull
form which produce no shoulder
waves and which would create only
sine-curve surface w-ave systems at the
bow and stern. Dr. Takahei devel-
oped a series of hull shapes called
cosine-ship forms. Shown in the
sketch is a schematic drawing of the
hull shape as obtained by the partic-
ular analysis under consideration.
Mathematically, it defines the stream
surface caused in a uniform flow by
the particular hydrodynamic singu-
larity chosen for the calculation.
The reason for the designation of
cosine-ship form is that the water-
lines of the resulting hull are approxi-
mately cosine curves. You might be
commenting to yourself that this hull
shape certainly appears to be a far cry
from a real ship form. In one sense,
this is true and indicates an area of
study worthy of much attention. How-
ever, the resulting simplicity of the
wave patterns and the expressions for
resistance make this formulation very
desirable for initial research work.
The unusual result with these hull
forms (first discovered in some earlier
work by Dr. Inui of the University
of Tokyo with some similar hull de-
signs) was the drooping midships bot-
tom shape obtained by the streamline
calculation. This feature arises en-
tirely from the mathematical formu-
lation and is not necessarily a desir-

able characteristic for real ship hulls.
Now, having the hull forms des-
cribed analytically, the next logical
step is to study the leaves and wave-
making resistance of the hull. In a
physical sense, this is accomplished
by considering that the hull stream
surface obtained from before pierces
the free surface of the fluid in which
the hull is operating. By an approxi-
mating method for satisfying the
boundary conditions at this inter-
face, a wave pattern or wavetrain
system can be calculated which con-
forms to the variations in pressures
along the hull length, and which pro-
ceeds outward away from the ship in
exactly the fashion with which we are
all familiar. The sketch shows the
transverse nature of these waves taken
in profile taken against the ship's
hull. Note that in this approximation,
each wave system—bow and stern—is
taken with its origin located exactly
at the stem and stern respectively.
The sine function character of these
waves is also indicated in the sketch.
For simplicity, let us now consider
only the hull bow wave pattern, since
it is against this wave system alone
that the botu bulb wave interferes.
Derived in the manner described
above, the components of the free
bow wave pattern are given in the
following integral equation.

These equations are included here
solely for the purpose of appealing
to the reader's quick glance. The im-
portant features of the wave pattern
expression are the amplitude function
and the oscillatory term as noted in
the figures. The reason for the im-
portance of these features will be-
come clear when the bulb wave pat-
tern is considered.
The "Mathematical Bulb"
It has now been established that
one may obtain a mathematical hull
form, and with the proper analysis,
determine the patterns of its various
wave systems with reasonably simple
expressions. Let us now turn to the
problem of the bulbous bow form
itself, and to the nature of the math-
ematical treatment of its properties.
Among the early experiments per-
formed in connection with the large
interference-wave type bulb was a
series of tests bearing out the notion
that the action of a bulb could be
described as a "doublet" traveling
fully immersed and near the free sur-
face of a fluid. This verification was
accomplished by obtaining the actual
wave patterns from bulbs attached
to various models which were tested
in the towing tank. Having recorded
the experimental plots of these waves,
comparisons were made between these
and the wave plots calculated from
the theoretical assumption of the im-
mersed doublet. The results showed
excellent correlation. Once this phen-
omenon was established, the analysis
of the total problem of the wave
interference and cancellation effect
could be approached with a full com-
plement of theoretical and experi-
mental tools.
The obvious question now is, what
is this business of the immersed doub-
let, and exactly how does it generate
a wave pattern which has the proper
relationship with the hull wave sys-
tem in order to cause cancellation?
As one might imagine, the concept of
the stream surface must again enter
the discussion (this time for the bulb
shape).
In this situation, the nature of the
mathematical singularity giving rise
to a shape similar to a bulbous form
is simple enough to be described here
(unlike the rather complicated one
used to generate the main hull stream
surface). Consider the included
sketch.
The "doublet" consists of a source
and a sink (a theoretical "point fau-
cet" or source of fluid, and a theo-
retical "point drain" or sink for
fluid) of the same strength m sepa-
rated by a distance 8. A spherical
stream surface S will be formed in the
limt with a characteristic radius a0
(see the figure).
As with the main hull, an approxi-
mation to the boundary conditions
on the free surface allows the calcu-
lation of the free wave pattern. The
components of the free wave system
of a doublet traveling in the -x direc-
tion whose axis is parallel to the
x-axis and immersed to a depth f is
given by the following integral equa-
tions. Physically, the minus pressure
region immediately above the sphere
causes the particular profile shown
in the sketch. In a similar fashion

the amplitude function and oscilla-
tory term are identified in the figure.
The obtained amplitude function
allows the wave-making resistance to
be calculated as shown.

Now, the crux of the matter is ap-
parent. By observing the free wave
patterns of the hull and bulb respec-
tively, the mathematical nature of
wave interference and cancellation is
revealed. If the origins of the two
systems are made to coincide, the
oscillatory terms are identical except
for sign; hence, both integrands may
be placed under a single integral. The
resulting expression for the combined
wave system of hull's bow wave and
the bulb wave is given by

Clearly, by proper minimization of
the quantity (AE (9) - BP (6) )= the
resultant or combined wave pattern
can be reduced to a minimal condi-
tion as well.
What significance has this effect on
the wave-making resistance? The an-
swer to this question lies in the ex-
pression for the combined system as
before.
HULL BOW WAV1 AND BULB

One does not need to fully under-
stand the integral equations to appre-
ciate the obvious interference charac-
teristics inherent in them. The physi-
cal feeling for the completely inverse
phase relationship of the bulb wave
with respect to the main hull wave is
easily seen in the combined for given
above. It is certainly an amazing re-
36
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


(Continued from page 33)
suit that two shapes so different from
one another could create waves such
that cancellation is so closely approxi-
mated.
The Actual Bulb Form
In quick review, the discussion has
dealt with the main hull stream sur-
face and its characteristic wave pat-
terns yielding the wave-making resist-
ance. Likewise, the bulb form, ap-
proximated as a traveling doublet, has
been shown to generate wave patterns;
and it subsequently suffers wave-
making resistance which has an in-
verse phase relationship with that of
the main hull. Thus, the bulb wave
interference and cancellation effect at
a design speed can be accomplished
by the proper alteration of the quan-
tity BF (6) in its relationship with
AP (8). From the equations considered
before, this juggling of the bulb wave
amplitude function deals primarily
with the value of the doublet strength
M (hence, a„3, the characteristic bulb
radius cubed). This fact appeals
very strongly to one's physical grasp
of the action of the bulb, for it is
able, and that for the low speed range
a 'teardrop' bulb will be preferred."1
The reason for the location of the
bulb center forward from the ship's
hull is that the main hull bow wave
profile does not really have its origin
at the forefoot as the first approxima-
tion assumes. Rather, this origin is
located some 3-6% of the ship's
length forward of the stem. A phase
shift of this magnitude of the hull
wave requires that the bulb wave sys-
tem also be shifted forward to retain
the fullest interference effect. Recog-
nition of the phase shift came as a
result of actual model tests and has
been found to be difficult to quan-
tify theoretically.
A Waveless Hull
As a final note to this article, the
concept of a "waveless hull" should
be mentioned. This idea is merely an
extension of the interference and
cancellation effect possible with the
bow wave system to that stern wave
system as well (assuming a "cosine-
ship" main hull which has only bow
and stern patterns). Though there
and stern bulb—has virtually no wave-
making resistance because of wave
cancellation at both the bow and
stern.
Ideally, it would be interesting to
use this virtually wave-free design in
a practical application with a con-
ventional hull. Unfortunately the
stern bulb configuration is such that
many difficulties would be encoun-
tered. It is erroneous, however, to
think that this negates the value of
the studies involved. Clearly the 13%
reduction in power requirements for
the Kurenai Maru fitted with a bulb
alone illustrates the realm of improve-
ment in resistance qualities in which
these bulbous forms operate. It would
be foolish to judge ship design on re-
sistance alone; and, needless to say,
the problems in other areas with
these bulbs are many (docking, for
example, is now a compounded prob-
lem with the large bulb protruding
from the stem). Nevertheless, the
promises of utilizing this unusual
marriage of theory and application
do look optimistic, but only time will
tell.

plain to see that the sphere size will
have a great deal to do with bulb
waves created on the surface.
Concerning the actual design of
the bulbous form, then, it is seen to
be basically a sphere which is faired
into the hull lines by means of fillet-
ing. The primary consideration is
that the volume of the sphere (ex-
cluding fillet) be adjusted to that
volume corresponding to the required
doublet necessary for optimum wave
cancellation. "In general, it can be
said that for the high speed range a
sphere-type bulb will be most suit-

Through experimentation and care-
ful testing, a nearly "waveless hull
form" was actually achieved by Jap-
anese efforts in the Tokyo Tank. The

signed to allow smooth flow in behind

FORGED...
to eliminate tool damage
and leakers
The forged steel cylinder cap shown at top is used on
the rod end of a Nike missile launcher cylinder.
Before the changeover to forgings, cylinder caps
were a source of problems. Tool breakage and tool
wear were excessive because the cored castings
lacked concentricity, were contaminated with non-
metallic inclusions. When the caps, after costly
machining, were hydrostatically tested at 4,500 psi,
porosity of the castings often resulted in leakers.
The switch to forgings produced these
cost-cutting results:
40% reduction in initial cost when forgings
replaced castings.
20% increase in tool life.
12% increase in production — unscheduled tool
replacement eliminated.
6% rejection rate caused by porosity
reduced to zero.
10% reduction in weight with increased strength.
As you take your place in today's high-speed world,
where progress is paced by imaginative engineering,
it will pay you to ask, "What about forgings?" for
many of the things you will develop, design, engineer,
produce. Forgings are competitive in price, superior
in quality wherever strength/weight ratio, or
integrity of material is important.

The isotopic fueled thermoelectric
generator has a power potential rang-
ing from 25 watts to 1 kw. It will
eventually attain efficiencies of about
15% and a lifetime of two years. Its
safety, versatility, relative indepen-
dence to environment, as well as reli-
ability over long periods of unattend-
ed operation, suggests immediate
applications where other electrical
power sources have proven unable to
fulfill operational requirements. Ob-
taining its heat from the spontaneous
decay of a selected radioisotope, the
generator employs nuclear fission
products previously considered as
waste material from spent reactor fuel
elements, to generate power. While
storage of this waste was once an ex-
pensive and difficult disposal prob-
lem, it now can be processed and
packaged into devices capable of con-
verting its heat of decay to electricity.
Levels of power are not great, but are
particularly useful for operation of
electronic devices. Although several
hundred radioisotopes are actually
formed during the fission of uranium,
only a few can have real application
as fuel material for a power gener-
ator. Such criteria as a relatively long
half-life, isotopic abundance and de-
cay energy, limit the selection.
Snap 9A has been designed to pro-
vide the total power requirements
for Transit 5A, an operational ver-
sion of the navigation satellite. It will
deliver 25 watts of unregulated power
to an improved DC-DC converter.
Snap-11, a 25 watt unit using cur-
ium 242, will supplement the solar
cell system for Surveyor, principally
to provide power during lunar night.
A basic cesium thermionic convert-
er has 2 electrodes, and employs the
cesium to reduce space charge, collec-
tor work function, and to control the
emitter work function. Ionization of
the cesium is achieved thermally.
Heat is supplied to the emitter. The
electrons in the emitter acquire ener-
gy sufficient to overcome the work
function barrier hill existing in the
interelectrode spacing, and then, con-
dense on the cold collector. The work
function of the collector is less than
the emitter work function and there-
fore, the electrons in the collector
have excess energy relative to those in
the emitter. This excess energy is em-
ployed as the driving output voltage.
SOLAR
For output power levels up to per-
haps 20 kw, solar power systems may
be lighter, safer, and less expensive
than nuclear systems.
Solar cells are the most widely used
and most thoroughly developed pow-
er source, having established an effi-
ciency level of about 10%. Tech-
nological goals include improved
radiation resistance, lower weight,
lower cost, better mechanical proper-
ties, higher efficiency and improved
temperature characteristics.

sion systems, particularly at higher
power levels, require concentration of
the incident energy in order to obtain
high temperature. Typical systems re-
quiring concentration include therm-
ionic emitters and Rankine cycle tur-
boelectric systems. The ultimate
utility of solar-thermal power systems
depends largely on the ability to con-
struct lightweight, accurate and (for
large power systems) foldable solar
concentrators.
Concentrator size and geometry are
directly related to system parameters
such as conversion efficiency, power
level, and maximum cycle tempera-
ture. The absorber geometry, the
temperature desired at the outlet of
the absorber geometry, and the
amount of heat withdrawn from the
absorber also directly affect concen-
trator design.
Flat plate collectors with spectrally
selective coatings can provide hot
junction temperatures up to about
500°F for use with thermoelectric
convenors. Efficiencies are predicted
to be of the order of 2 to 4 per cent
so that large area devices are required.
Though some attention has been
paid to simple-curvature reflectors of
circular or parabolic cross-section, de-
velopment work now appears to favor
large, compound-curvature concen-
trators of the unfolding-petal and in-
flatable types. An example of the
latter is a 44.5 ft. aluminized-Mylar
design by Goodyear Aircraft for a
15-kw dynamic solar powerplant. The
reflecting surface of the concentrator
is on the inside of a specially formed
balloon whose inflation generates the
proper curvature. After inflation, the
mirror is rigidized with foam-in-place
plastic, and the rest of the balloon is
burned off.
Sundstrand Aviation's 15-kw Ran-
kine cycle turbogenerator has the
highest output of all the solar power
supplies under development. It prob-
ably represents the highest power
level at which it is feasible to make
use of the sun's radiation with today's
materials development. Its rotation
components, turbine, pump, and gen-
erator are well mounted on a single
shaft within the same housing. The
combined power unit runs on gas
bearings.
The rubidium working fluid is
superheated to 1750°F to drive the
turbine. The concentrated solar ener-
gy from the mirror is received in a
dual-cavity boiler, with the outer
cavity operating at about 1200°F to
bring the working fluid to its boiling
point, and the inner cavity super-
heating the vapor. Each cavity has a
thermal storage chamber, with lith-
ium hydride used in the outer cavity
and sodium fluoride in the inner. The
flux level in the cavities is controlled
by rotating iris diaphragm.
System efficiencies are calculated at
74% for the mirror-boiler combina-
tion and about 25% overall. The
total system weight is 819 pounds, for
a specific power of 54.5 lb/kw at the
design output.
CHEMICAL
The fuel cell is an electrochemical
device for converting chemical energy
directly into electrical energy. A fuel
cell consists of an anode at which
oxidation takes place, an electrolyte,
and a cathode at which an oxidizing
agent is consumed.
The total power obtainable from a
fuel cell is limited by the amount of

BAYMAlZ-one of our many new products
that could launch a thousand careers
New careers are important by-products of Du Pont research.
Developing BAYMAL* is a case in point.
BAYMAL is a white, free-flowing powder. It's intentionally
synthesized into submicron-sized fibrillar particles about 5
millimicrons in diameter and about 200 millimicrons in length.
These small particles display a number of properties com-
pletely different from other types of alumina now available.
Dispersibility to form stable sols with unique thixotropy,
viscosity and film forming characteristics is one of its notable
properties. Our photos illustrate another. Shake a BAYMAL-
and-water solution and it will pour. Let it sit awhile and it will
gel—won't pour unless you agitate it again.
We see dozens of potential uses for BAYMAL. But it's up
to our development men to bring this new product to com-
mercial maturity, and here is where careers are born.
You see, from the day we examine a sample of the chemical
to the day a full-scale plant starts turning out the finished
product, years may elapse—years of patient work by chemical
engineers developing processes and assembling basic data
for process design, by mechanical engineers who must create
new equipment to make the product, by electrical engineers
whose job it is to develop control systems to meet the needs
of the process.
And BAYMAL is just one of literally hundreds of new prod-
ucts under development at Du Pont. Each one gives promise
of new and rewarding careers for technical men—perhaps like
yourself-preparing to enter industry.

SUPERCONDUCTIVE WIRE
This coll of superconducting wire shown being checked
for OD dimentions, is made of a columbium outer sheath
over a columbium tin power mixture by the Superior Tube
Company, Norristown, Pa. The longitudinal photomicro-
graph, taken at I00X magnification and unetched, (bottom
photograph) shows a single sheath, .015 inch diameter wire
made by drawing columbium tubing over a mixture of
Columbian and tin powers. After the wire is wound into
magnetic coils, it is fired to form the superconducting com-
pound Cb Sn. When the coil is immersed in liquid helium
and activated, it produces a very high magnetic field with
virtually no power required to sustain the field once formed.
POWER BETWEEN THE PLANETS
fuel available. If an outside source of
energy such as thermal, photochemi-
cal, nuclear or photovoltaic is used to
dissociate the products of the fuel cell
reaction into the original constitu-
ents, the fuel cell becomes contin-
uously recyclable, i.e., regenerative.
The fuel required would be only that
needed to fill the fuel cell, regenera-
ting system and storage tanks. Thus,
it is possible to design a closed cycle
regenerative system which will not
carry large amounts of fuel for pro-
longed operation in a sustained flight
vehicle.
Several types of regenerative fuel
cells are being developed for use in
space power systems. The hydrogen-
oxygen ion-exchange membrane fuel
cell is especially suitable for opera-
tion in the environment of outer
space. It has relatively low specific
weight and volume. The ion-exchange
membrane serves as an electrolyte
matrix and eliminates the problems
associated with the use of free elec-
trolyte under zero-gravity. This sys-
tem is primarily being designed for
use in space power systems in con-
junction with photovoltaic cells. The
latter will furnish the electrical en-
ergy which is required to charge the
fuel cell.
The greatest potential use of the
regenerative fuel cell within the next
decade appears to be in orbiting satel-
lites with long life requirements. The
hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell has several
advantages over nickel-cadmium bat-
teries presently employed for energy
storage in most orbiting satellites.
The hydrogen and oxygen pressures
can be used to determine the state of
charge of the fuel cell whereas there
is no satisfactory method to determine
the state of a nickel-cadmium battery.
Nickel-cadium batteries can not be
fully discharged and require consider-
able overcharge The hydrogen-oxy-
gen fuel cell can be almost fully dis-
charged and does not require an over-
charge. The fuel cell also has, poten-
tially, much higher specific outputs
than nickel-cadmium batteries.
CRYOGENIC POWER SYSTEMS
A new thermodynamic cycle, called
the Cryhocycle, developed by Sund-
strand Aviation, with an integrated
power generation and cooling cycle,
has shown much promise.
Well within the state-of-the-art, it
features high reliability and lower
weight than fuel cells. It needs about
3 times the volume of a nominal 2
kw fuel-cell system though. The ener-
gy is extracted from the waste heat
and converted into useful power in a
low temperature, highly efficient sys-
tem.
Mission requirements include a
peak power output of slightly less
than 3 kw, averaging 2 kw for 336
hours (14 days). Average specific pro-
pellant consumption is 1925 lb/kw
hr., total weight being 1187 lb., and
volume 142 cu. ft.
The small weight advantage for 2
kw power levels is substantially in-
creased as the power level is increased.
With no radiators required, there is

precise temperature control without
the concern for micronieteoroid pro-
tection or damage. The system pro-
vides cooling without regard to the
ambient environment. Since the sys-
tem operates at a relatively low tem-
perature of between 120° F. and 140°
F., there is a high reliability factor
presently calculated to be .9972.
MAGNETOHYDRODYNAMIC
POWER GENERATION
The generation of electric power
by passing a conducting fluid through
a magnetic field is not a new concept,
and is based on the well-known prin-
ciple which states that when a con-
ductor cuts magnetic lines of flux an
electromotive force is generated.
In its simplest form, an MHD gen-
erator consists merely of a channel
which one passes a stream of electri-
cally conducting gas. The top and
bottom surfaces represent magnet
faces, while the sides are electrodes.
Consider for a moment that the gas
flow corresponds to the armature in
an ordinary generator. Passage of the
conducting gas through the transverse
magnetic field induces an electric
field between the electrodes and a re-
sulting current will flow if the elec-
trodes are closed through an exter-
nal circuit. This current then reacts
back on the gas flow through a body
force, the magnitude of which equals
the product of the current and mag-
netic field.
One distinguishing feature of a
MHD generator as compared to a
convertional turrbogenerator is that
it utilizes an ionized and, hence, elec-
trically conducting gas. Of import-
ance then are the values of conductiv-
ity which may be reached and the
conditions required to achieve them.
The value of gas conductivity deter-
mines the magnetic field strength and
generator size necessary for the pro-
duction of a given amount of power.
Also the MHD channel replaces
both turbine and generator. Thus, de-
spite the much lower electrical con-
ductivities involved, the inherent
simplicity can lead to power densities
orders of magnitude higher than in
conventional equipment.
The MHD generator may be used
for any application requiring outputs
in the megawatt range for short or
long time periods. Applications in-
clude central station power genera-
tion, self-sufficient high peak power,
limited-duty cycle power packs, in-
cluding portable and flyable, and
energy storage and discharge in some
ranges now covered by capacitor and
inductive storage devices.
Development of the MHD genera-
tor is proceeding rapidly and it ap-
pears to have wide application. Most
of the basic questions have been
answered, and the problems remain-
ing are largely of a practical nature.
By virtue of the limited conductiv-
ity which can be induced in working
fluids heated by conventional energy
sources, the MHD generator is most
ideally suited to those applications re-
quiring large amounts of power. On
the other hand, there appears to be
no upper limit to the peak power
capability of the generator.

page directions on a type of program
tailed the "Crowder TutorText" to a
complex computer selector. The op-
eration of the selector may be deter-
mined by 3) a random programmer
which is intended to prevent the
formation of "serial habits." That is,
human beings tend to learn sequences
or serial connections which might in-
terfere with the growth of the
"habits" which are under training. 4)
a performance evaluator. This deter-
mines whether or not the subjects re-
sponse was appropriate (correct). This
can wholly or partially determine the
next problem. 5) the performance
memory which keeps a record of the
subjects past performance. It may de-
termine to various degrees the action
of the program selector. For instance,
the memory might add steps for a stu-
dent who has made a large number
of errors (though this shouldn't hap-
pen, and, if the memory reacts fast
enough, it can't) or the memory
might speed up the sequence for a
student who is breezing through the
material.
6) the stimulus presentation gate
(to adopt computer jargon) is merely
the device which presents the pro-
gram. This may range from a TV
screen to an opening in which a writ-
ten problem or statement appears. 7)
the response acceptor gate, is simply
the means by which the student indi-
cates his response to the machine.
This may be a button or merely
marking the choice of response with
a pencil on a prepared form or any
of numerous similar devices. 8) the
response evaluation indicator. This is
basically the reinforcing element of
the machine. It may be a light to in-
dicate a correct response or a written
statement with praise or just the cycl-
ing of the program to the next step.
A practical machine though, may eli-
minate any of these functions in
whole or in part depending on the
discretion and purpose of the design-
er.
The Program
Despite the elaborate description
above, the teaching machine itself
can be simply classed as the most effi-
cient way to present the real heart of
programmed learning: the program.
Unfortunately, "the program" doesn't
lend itself to a detailed and clear de-
scription. Essentially, though, it is the
set of directions which tell the ma-
chine what material to present, what
questions to ask, and how to respond
to the subjects response. It is com-
posed for specific subject matter in
accordance with the empirical "prin-
ciples" of learning. Yet. as men-
tioned before, the coefficients of our
learning equation are practically un-
determined. This is where the con-
cept of feedback becomes useful. The
concept amounts to letting the stu-
dent "write" his own program. To
regress for a moment, the program is
constructed to follow the general
principles as closely as possible and
the coefficients are arrived at by "edu-

cated guesswork." The program is
then tried out on students. The re-
sults are recorded (possibly by the per-
formance memory) and "fed back" to
the programmer. From this record,
the programmer is able to see where
the students failed to learn a fact or
concept. He can then "fix up" the
program by adding explanatory ma-
terial or increasing the rate of rein-
forcement or varying any of the other
learning variables. The program is
tried again. After a sufficient number
of trials, the coefficients of learning
for this specific situation are fairly
accurately determined and an opti-
mal program is arrived at.
Except for one interesting varia-
tion, we have pretty well covered the
"theory" of teaching machines. Al-
though various people and compa-
nies use different terminology, prac-
tically every teaching machine em-
ploys the above ideas in one form or
another.
The "interesting variation" that I
mentioned is the approach of
Thomas F. Gilbert, formerly of the
Bell Telephone Laboratories and
presently at The University of Ala-
bama. Dr. Gilbert, in my opinion, has
the most valid and practical approach
to human learning at this stage of
psychological knowledge. He takes is-
sue with the relevance of any labora-
tory experiments to human learning
and proposes a pure feedback ap-
proach to teaching machines instead
of the empirical approach which actu-
ally implies a descriptive '"model" of
learning. Dr. Gilbert effectively pro-
poses a set of fourteen methodological
rules to follow in constructing a pro-
grammed learning device. In essence,
he tells the programmer to be an
authority on the subject and its con-
ventional teaching or to co-operate

with someone who is. The program-
mer should then write a program
which he thinks will establish the
desired repertory of behavior, with-
out recourse to any "principles" of
behavior which, according to Gilbert,
are probably misleading anyway and
might easily lead to overlooking some
effective teaching technique. He
should then try the program on one
student; it will probably fail in most
respects. Next, he fixes it up as best
he can and tries it again. Eventually,
he will come up with a program
which does the job effectively and is
unbiased by what might be false and
or incomplete principles of learning.
This approach is admirably suited to
modern data processing methods and
would rapidly, I believe, yield useful
and effective programs (though I can
picture most "theorists" objecting vio-
lently to this approach).
Two Existing Machines
Up to now, I've talked a lot about
"theory" and generalized machines;
therefore, it might be of interest to
describe existing teaching machines.
Since there are a number of different
versions of teaching machines, it is
difficult to decide which ones to de-
scribe. Let us look at a machine con-
structed by B. F. Skinner, a recognized
authority on teaching machines and
learning, because his machine is typi-
cal of the simpler ones being used. Let
us also look at a machine designed by
Norman Crowder, because Crowder
(though much less a "theoretician"
than Skinner) has also contributed a
lot to the practical development of
teaching machines and because Crow-
der's machine is representative of the
more complex machine and is pres-
ently being manufactured by a promi-
nent corporation.
The particular machine by Skinner
presents the program in the form of
thirty frames on a twelve-inch disk.
The student inserts the disc and closes
the machine. He can't proceed until
the machine has been locked; and,
once locked, the machine cannot be
unlocked until the program is com-
pleted. All but a corner of a given
frame is visible in a window. The
student writes his response on a paper
exposed through a second opening.
He then lifts a lever on the front of
the machine which moves what he
has written under a transparent cover
and uncovers the remaining corner of
the frame, which contains the correct
response. If the two responses corres-
pond, he moves the lever horizontally
which punches a hole in the paper
opposite his response, recording the
fact that he was correct and altering
the machine so that the frame will
not appear again. Whether the re-
sponse was correct or not, a new
frame appears. The student continues
in this way until all frames have been
punched or answered correctly.
Crowder's machine is more com-
plex and elaborate. Its trade name is
AutoTutor Mark II. It is described
as, basically, an automatic, semi-ran-
dom, film projector with a rear pro-
jection screen. The machine contains
a reel of 35mm film which can easily
be changed and has from 1500 to
3000 frames per reel. To the right of
the projection screen is a row of nine
selector buttons and one return but-
ton. A frame is shown on the screen
along with multiple choice responses
which are lettered in order. The stu-
dent presses a selector button to cor-
respond with his desired response.
The machine immediately projects a
corresponding frame. If the choice is
an error, an interlock makes it impos-
sible to proceed until the return but-
ton is pressed and the correct response
is emitted.
Teaching Machines in Use
In order to be consistent with the
pragmatic tone of the rest of the
paper, we should now ask the simple
and obvious question of: do teaching
machines work in practice? There is
not an overwhelming quantity of data
which would allow an unqualified yes
in answer. However, where teaching
machines have been used, they have
been at least as successful as conven-
tional methods. Let me cite a few in-
stances. The AutoTutor was used at
Keesler Air Force Base to train tech-
nicians in fundamentals of electron-
ics. The program was a crude first
draft (no feedback corrections had
been made) There was no significant
difference in the performance of the
experimental and control groups.
Though, this certainly doesn't justify
any absolute answers, it would seem
to indicate that an improved program
would be superior to conventional
means. The same machine was used
to teach high ability students in the
11th and 12th grades at Lompoc Uni-
fied Schools in California, the ele-
ments of computer arithmetic. In this
case, the machine taught groups,
showed significant superiority over
the control groups. B. F. Skinner has
used versions of his machine to teach
elementary arithmetic and college
physics with similar results. Many
similar trials could be mentioned.
These "trends" of data would seem to
indicate that as experience increases
and as teaching machine technology
progresses, machines will begin to
show a marked superiority over con-
ventional methods.
Conclusion
This discussion has covered the
subject of teaching machines in a very
general way. There have been many
important issues that time and space
have forced me to overlook, a few of
the more important ones are: a point
by point comparison of the combina-
tion of teaching variables in conven-
tional classroom with the combination
provided by a machine; the ability of
the machine to form abstract con-
cepts; the transfer of machine learn-
ing to the real world; the economics
of teaching machines; and the phil-
osophical and moral implications of
teaching everyone in exactly the same
way. A detailed discussion of these
would round out a discussion of
teaching machines.

We make machines, but Wall Street calls us a chemical company.
People who know nothing about Wall Street associate us with simple little cameras.
Photography involves cameras, and it also involves chemicals. A great deal of our chemical
activity, however, does not involve photography. On the other hand, the chemistry of photog-
raphy now hides inside machines like the ones above, so that photography doesn't seem to
involve chemistry any more. "Involved" is certainly the word for the situation.
It is an involved situation but it is also a very healthy one.
So healthy is the demand for electromechanical machines of all kinds and sizes to perform
the chemical operations of photography that our sizable body of electromechanical engineers
keeps very pleasantly occupied. Possibly you will write to us, and possibly we shall strike up a
correspondence, and possibly you too will come to work for us as an electromechanical
engineer, and possibly you will be running a vitamin factory for us on the day we pin the 25-
year medal on you. That's the beauty of diversification.

An Interview
with G.E.'s
H. B. Miller,
Vice President,
Manufacturing
Services

Halbert B. Miller has managerial
responsibility for General Electric's
Manufacturing Services. This re-
sponsibility includes performing serv-
ices work for the Company in the
areas of manufacturing engineering,
manufacturing operations and or-
ganization; quality control; person-
nel development; education, train-
ing and communications; materials
management; purchasing and sys-
tems as well as the Real Estate and
Construction Operation. Mr. Miller
holds a degree in mechanical engi-
neering and began his General
Electric career as a student engi-
neer on the Company's Test Course

Manufacturing Careers Offer
Diversity, Challenge
and Opportunity
Q. Mr. Miller, what do engineers do in manufacturing?
A. Engineers design, build, equip, and operate our General Electric plants through-
out the world. In General Electric, this is manufacturing work, and it sub-divides
into categories, such as quality control engineering, materials management, shop
management, manufacturing engineering, and plant engineering. All of these jobs
require technical men for many reasons. First, the complexity of our products is
on the increase. Today's devices—involving mechanical, electrical, hydraulic,
electronic, chemical, and even atomic components—call for a high degree of
technical knowhow. Then there's the progressive trend toward mechanization and
automation that demands engineering skills. And finally, the rapid development of
new tools and techniques has opened new doors of technical opportunity—elec-
tronic data processing, computers, numerically programmed machine tools, auto-
matic processing, feedback control, and a host of others. In short, the require-
ments of complex products of more exacting quality, of advanced processes and
techniques of manufacture, and of industry's need for higher productivity add up
to an opportunity and a challenge in which the role of engineers is vital.
Q. How do opportunities for technical graduates in manufacturing stack up
with other areas?
A. Manufacturing holds great promise for the creative technical man with leader-
ship ability. Over 60 percent of the 250,000 men and women in General Electric
are in manufacturing. You, as an engineer, will become part of the small technical
core that leads this large force, and your opportunity for growth, therefore, is
unexcelled. Technical graduates in manufacturing are teamed with those in mar-
keting who assess customer needs; those in research and development who con-
ceive new products: and those in engineering who create new product designs. I
sincerely believe that the role of technical graduates of high competence in the
manufacturing function is one of the major opportunities for progress in industry.
Q. What technical disciplines are best suited to a career in manufacturing?
A. We need men with Doctor's, Master's, and Bachelor's degrees in all the tech-
nical disciplines, including engineering, mathematics, chemistry and physics. We
need M.B.A.'s also. General Electric's broad diversification plus the demands of
modern manufacturing call for a wide range of first-class technical talent. For one
example: outside of the Federal Government, we're the largest user of computers
in the United States. Just think of the challenge to mathematicians and business-
systems men.
Q. My school work has emphasized fundamentals. Will General Electric train
me in the specifics I need to be effective?
A. Yes. the Manufacturing Training Program is designed to do just that. Seminars
which cover the sub-functions of manufacturing will expose vou to both the theo-
retical and practical approaches to operating problems. Each of the succeeding
jobs you have will train you further in the important work areas of manufacturing.
Q. After the Program—what?
A. From that point, your ability and initiative will determine your direction.
Graduates of the Manufacturing Training Program have Company-wide oppor-
tunities and they continue to advance to positions of greater responsibility.

A phenomenon of modern America is the so-called
"think company." It owns no factories, manufac-
tures no products and makes no shipments, but
just "thinks" about problems--and brilliant ways
to solve them.
We have a number of "think companies" at Westing-
house. One is a group of scientists who do almost
nothing but seek basic knowledge, like the produc-
tion of light by solids and the origin of magnetism
Other Westinghouse scientists apply basic knowledge
to that most demanding of all problems ... national defense.
And there is still another group whose principal job is to
think about what products will be needed in the American home
10 or 15 years from now.
Out of this kind of thinking at Westinghouse have come
startling advances in atomic power, the launching system for
Polaris, the super magnet, and other developments.
The achievements of Westinghouse scientists in the past
are the best guarantee of new ones in the future.
For information on rewarding career opportunities at
Westinghouse, an equal opportunity employer, talk with
our representative when he visits your campus, or write

DOW?
Dow is people.
Chemical, civil, electrical, industrial,
mechanical, metallurgical and mining
engineers. Agricultural, analytical,
inorganic, organic, physical and bio-
chemists. Biologists, business admin-
istrators, mathematicians and
physicists. Those are just a few of the
skilled people Dow needs—now.
Dow is research. At 50 separate
laboratories, it goes on continually.
Basic research, process development,
and application research are among
the many fields. Present plants are
being expanded, new ones planned
and built. Sales have quadrupled since
World War II. Many of our more than
700 products didn't even exist then.
"Dow is a good place to work," our
people say. Fringe benefits help make
it so: stock purchase plan is offered
periodically; sickness and accident
benefits; life insurance; hospitalization
insurance; annual salary review; pen-
sion and profit-sharing plan; educa-
tion refund plan.

going our way?
It's a direction you should definitely consider when charting
the course of your career.
As the pioneer and leading manufacturer of VTOL (vertical
take-off and landing) aircraft, we know that many young
engineers have found "going our way" to be a challenging and
exciting route to career goals.
Here, at Sikorsky Aircraft, alert, well-trained engineering minds
will enjoy the individual recognition and personal growth
opportunities which go hand in hand with the startling advances
of a new technology. The modern Sikorsky vehicle is a VTOL
system which embodies the merging of sophisticated electronic
systems with the VTOL airframe ... to create the world's most
versatile means of transportation.
And the reach of the exciting future ahead for VTOL systems
can at best only be suggested by such current usages as: space
capsule recovery • anti-submarine systems • equipment and
personnel transport • airport passenger travel • industrial
transport and personal transportation.
Supporting these activities is an excellent engineering environ-
ment . . . providing for free and active interchange of ideas
between small, compact, interdependent groups. Assignments
are diversified and stimulating—with electronic teams or groups
working on demanding problems in such areas as aerodynam-
ics • human factor* engineering • automatic controls
• stress engineering • weight prediction • systems anal-
ysis • operations research • reliability/maintainabil-
ity engineering • autonavlgatlon systems... among others.
GRADUATE STUDY OPPORTUNITIES: In addition to
an attractive professional environment, Sikorsky Aircraft offers

To catch an atom.
Did you know that only one in every 140 uranium atoms found in nature can be split to produce usable
nuclear energy? It takes fantastically intricate equipment to capture these elusive atoms. The people of
Union Carbide are doing it in a plant at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, large enough to hold 35 football fields.
► Many people thought the uranium separation process too complex to work. For example, pumps had
to be developed, that run faster than the speed of sound . . . filters made with holes only two-millionths of
an inch across. Union Carbide scientists and engineers not only helped design such a plant and made it
work, 20 years ago, but they have been operating it ever since. Union Carbide also operates other vital
nuclear energy installations for the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. One is Oak Ridge National Labora-
tory, the largest nuclear research center in the country. ► To handle such big research and production jobs
requires big, experienced industrial companies. It is only because of their extensive resources and skills
that it is possible to take the giant steps needed to bring laboratory developments to full-scale
production quickly and successfully.

answering questions frequently asked us by college seniors
A MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR TO
U.S. DEFENSE
The largest American-owned inter-
national enterprise engaged in all as-
pects of electronic and telecommunica-
tion systems, International Telephone
and Telegraph Corporation operates
both domestic and foreign divisions
and subsidiaries. Among its nine prin-
cipal U.S. engineering/scientific organ-
izations, four are engaged in advanced
work for the Armed Forces and NASA.
Programs include:
large scale computer-based command/
control systems □ global communica-
tions systems (line of sight, tropo
scatter, lunar bounce, digital, telecom-
munications) □ ICBM base communi-
cations and control systems □ satel-
lite control &amp; communication systems
□ engineering support for large scale
warning systems □ antisubmarine
warfare systems □ electronic counter-
measures □ tactical military air navi-
gation systems □ ground support &amp;
environmental test systems □ infrared
detection &amp; guidance systems □
atomic clocks □ systems manage-
ment: world-wide, local.
DEEP IN DIVERSIFIED U.S.
COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISES
Prominent among ITT's domestic
commercial products is a new, high-
speed digital communication system
for large industrial firms. ITT in the
U. S. also develops and manufactures
a vast variety of radio equipments and
systems, automatic programmers, tele-
printers, telephone equipment, infra-
red image converters, image storage
and intensifier tubes, high resolution
scanners, twt's, coaxial cables and
other products.
Today, no less than 53 plants and fa-
cilities are operated by 16 ITT divi-
sions or subsidiaries in the United
States. Their combined income
amounts to roughly 40% of the total
figure for the world-wide operations
of the parent corporation, whose re-
sources stand solidly behind each op-
eration, at home and abroad.
ITT IN RESEARCH ft
DEVELOPMENT ENGINEERING
Basic and applied investigations re-
late to both military and commercial
programs. Extensive R&amp;D facilities
are provided. To cite one example,
ITT's own "Space Communications
Research Station," erected in Nutley,
N. J., was selected ,y NASA as one
of the ground terminals for the Proj-
ect Relay experimental satellite com-
munication system.
A PIONEER IN SYSTEMS
ENGINEERING
ITT's long experience in the operation
of world-wide communication systems
has made it a logical choice for both
systems development and systems
management contracts awarded by the
Armed Forces. Examples are:
Systems development, design and
management of the vast SAC global
command/control system 465-L □
Coordination and management of the
10 year program to expand and mod-
ernize AIR COM, global communica-
tions system of the U. S. Air Force.
GLOBAL PRACTITIONER OF
FIELD ENGINEERING
In the Arctic, in the Tropics, on land,
afloat, or undersea, ITT skills in on-
site engineering for every kind of
communication or large scale elec-
tronic system have been thoroughly
tested. It is equipped to provide com-
plete engineering support anywhere
in the free world. This includes in-
stallation, operation, maintenance,
evaluation and continuous modern-
ization, as assignments may require.
ITT's responsibilities in field and ap-
plications engineering include:
operation, maintenance and testing of
Pacific Missile Range facilities for the
U. S. Navy □ engineering support, in-
stallation and maintenance for a
global digital command and control
system for SAC □ tropo scatter com-
munication systems spanning nations
in Europe and Asia □ 6,000 miles of
advanced radar and communications
equipment on DEWLINE.
UNIQUE INTERNATIONAL
RESOURCES FOR
PROFESSIONAL ENRICHMENT
ITT foreign affiliates and subsidiaries
operate public telephone systems in
19 countries. In addition, more than
12 overseas laboratories have made
many significant advances in commu-
nications technology. Technical
papers and progress reports steadily
circulate among R&amp;D people both at
home and abroad, and leading ITT
scientists and engineers participate in
international seminars conducted an-
nually by the company.

edge, experience, and skill in order to create beneficial
products for civilization. The engineering profession has al-
ways served as the connecting link between science and the
final product. In this modern age, with the secrets of the uni-
verse unfolding at an increasing rate, the engineer finds
himself faced with the task of utilizing this new know-ledge
in the design of his creations with the consequential better-
ment of society as his intended goal.
In the light of these duties of his profession, it is not sur-
prising to discover that the word "engineer" originates from
the word "ingenuity," and that the traits of originality, in-
ventiveness, and skill characterize the man who is a practicing
engineer. He is a man educated in the fundamentals and
principles of science and theory, and more important, a man
who places demands upon his talents and resources for the
purpose of integrating his vast scientific knowledge with the
experience which he has gained through his dealings with the
world.
By building on the previous conclusions, an observation of
the engineer can be made: he is a person who couples his
innate abilities and proficiencies with his acquired experience
to benefit his fellow man by creating products of social use-
fulness. In short, engineering is an art and the engineer,
serving as a disciple of that art, practices its precepts.
This statement that engineering is an art may seem
somewhat strange and foreign since it is being applied to a
scientifically-oriented profession. However, observation of the
techniques used in engineering indicates that here exists art
in a form as pure as any known to mankind.
The creations and products are the culmination of the
"engineering process;" initially, the engineer is faced with
a problem; for example, his problem may be to design a
device for a specific application. This device must meet cer-
tain requirements and perform certain functions. Thus the
problem is stated, and the solution remains as the task for
the engineer, who must follow an orderly pattern of attack
until the final, completed design has been accepted.
First, the problem is formulated; by using the knowledge of
physics and/or chemistry, the engineer is able to idealize
the problem into a form which is suitable for solution. This
8

idealized model is then further simplified. Some of the tools
which the engineer employs to assist him in this simplification
process are economics, logic, intuition, and experience.
Up to this point, a real life problem has been approached
and formulated with the purpose of arriving at a practical
solution. The final step is the mathematical solution of the
simplified model using approximation methods. The math-
ematical technicpies which are used depend upon the com-
plexity of the model; they may include areas of mathematics
such as geometry, algebra, calculus, differential equations, and
others.
The engineer is an artist; with judgement he uses the stand-
ard engineering technique and procedure to solve the prob-
lems of his profession. In doing so, he is "an approximator,
a simplifier, an integrator, and a creator." It is the combina-
tion of these activities which classifies engineering as an art.

a new world of opportunity in data processing
In the world of data processing many new ideas start an
expanding progression of new technologies, new sys-
tems, and new applications. This evolution runs full circle
in that it forms the stimulus for even further data process-
ing creativity. Within this expanding world, people at IBM
are building careers by meeting challenges with imagina-
tion through their knowledge of science, engineering,
business, and the arts. Through this progression their
achievements in turn become the source of new concepts
in tomorrow's information systems for business, industry,
science, education, and government.
The rapid growth and development of the data process-
ing field thus present exceptional career opportunities
and the professional stimulus that provide for individual
accomplishment. There is a wide choice of engrossing
assignments which can introduce you to satisfying and
rewarding careers: working in the basic sciences to ex-
plore new technologies, methods, and materials; design-
ing data processing equipment and planning manufacture;
evaluating performance of new systems during develop-
ment and manufacture; studying new applications for
machines and systems.



Data processing at IBM has created many new growth
positions for career-minded graduates—from research,
engineering, and development to manufacturing ....
Development Engineering: Bachelor of Science or ad-
vanced degree in electrical or mechanical engineering,
mathematics, or physics.
Manufacturing Engineering: B.S. or advanced degree in
industrial, electrical, or mechanical engineering.
Programming: Bachelor's or Master's degree, preferably
in mathematics, the sciences, engineering, or business
administration.
IBM education programs provide opportunities to keep
employees abreast of expanding technologies and help
them branch out into the new areas of discovery. Specific

With the beginning of a new publication year the
Technic is again faced with the job of publishing a dual
purpose magazine: a magazine which fulfills our obliga-
tion to our regular readers and also presents the engi-
neering profession to the high school student. We, the
editors, feel that there is really no conflict between these
two goals and have attempted to achieve both simul-
taneously.
It is extremely difficult to decide how to describe the
engineering profession. We could discuss a specific area
of engineering, or we could talk about engineering in a
general sense. Yet, neither approach is very satisfactory.
The discussion of a specific area of engineering gives one
a narrow, incomplete picture; a general discussion must,
of necessity, be vague and unsatisfactory, again yielding
an incomplete picture of an engineer's way of life. As a
result, we take a much less direct approach to the job
at hand.
In this issue, we have an article on engineering edu-
cation and the dichotomy between the engineer and the
scientist. We also present discussions of the engineer's
most basic tool, mathematics, and about his calculator,
the computer, and its place in scientific and technological
development. Finally, we talk about the newest area of
engineering, bio-engineering. We hope that these discus-
sions will help the prospective engineer to synthesize an
accurate and meaningful picture of the engineer's way
of life.

The Editors

THE
CHALLENGE
OF GROWTH
by STEPHEN S. ATTWOOD.
Dean, College of Engineering,
Professor of Electrical Engineering
For three years in my message in the February issues of the Michigan
Technic, I predicted startling events in engineering and science during this
decade. It is now evident that this was indeed a safe prediction. Subsequently,
I pursued this as a challenge to the student and discussed what might be in-
volved in accepting this challenge.
This year I should like to invite those of you who are now high school
students to join us at The University of Michigan College of Engineering in
this challenge. When I say join us in the challenge, I hope you will realize that
we have as great a challenge to grow as do you.
How can we educate engineers to be useful in a world that will change
so much between the freshman and the senior years? The answer is that we
ourselves are a part of this changing world; in fact our faculty and students
are effecting some of these changes in our great research and development
laboratories.
The fact that our faculty and students actively participate in this evolution
permits us to separate the instructional wheat from the chaff. A sound educa-
tion is never obsolete. Ours is obviously sound; otherwise we could not remain
in the forefront in the solution of the new and challenging problems.
We are prepared to help you enter our dynamic world at a level such as to
enable you to grow at a rate consistent with your preparation, ability, and
willingness to work. It is hard work—both for you and us—but what is there
worth doing that does not involve hard work? Will you accept this invitation?

ever at Bethlehem SteelI
We will not offer you just a job
(but if you're interested in a career, talk it over with us)
When we invite a man to join the
Bethlehem Loop Course, we are not
offering him a "job." We are invit-
ing him to begin a career. And, for
that reason, we train him—thor-
oughly—before he begins his first
work assignment.

The Bethlehem Loop Course
Since its beginning some forty
years ago, the Loop Course has
trained about 2,000 men who now
occupy responsible positions at all
levels of supervision and manage-
ment. The name comes from the
fact that members of the course
make an observational circuit (or
"loop") of a steel plant during their
basic training program.
New loopcrs report to our general
headquarters in Bethlehem, Pa.,
early in July. They attend a basic

course lasting five weeks. It in-
cludes talks and discussions by top
Company officials, educational
films, and daily plant visits. The
Loop Course is not a probationary
period. After completing the course,
every looper is assigned to a Beth-
lehem activity where he receives
additional specialized instruction
before beginning actual on-the-job
training.
Plenty of Opportunity
Because of the size and diversity
of its operations, Bethlehem offers
unlimited opportunities to "get
ahead." It's one of the nation's
largest industrial corporations, with
about 130,000 employees, engaged
in raw materials mining and proc-
essing, basic steelmaking, manu-
facturing of finished products,
structural steel fabricating and
erecting, shipbuilding, and ship
repair. We operate steelmaking
plants in the East and on the

BETHLEHEM

Pacific Coast; shipyards on the
Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific Coasts;
manufacturing units and fabri-
cating works in twelve states; and
sales offices in most leading cities.
Our new research laboratories, in
Bethlehem, Pa., are unexcelled by
any industry.

The eligibility requirements of
the Loop Course, as well as how it
operates, are more fully covered
in our booklet, "Careers with Beth-
lehem Steel and the Loop Course."

METHODS
by Prof. Wilfred Kaplan
Mathematics has been developed for
tzi'o reasons—its practical applications and
its beauty. Over the years it would seem
that mathematics would develop two
different branches, but it has not. The
applications of abstract mathematics to
physical problems and the creation of
abstract concepts by the study of con-
crete applications has woven the two to-
gether.
Mathematics orginated in the most
practical problems facing mankind—
in the need for counting, for measur-
ing, for understanding the shapes
about him. Yet, at a very early stage
in its development, mathematics fas-
cinated man and led him to study
it for its own beauty, to ask. such
seemingly unpractical questions as
whether there are infinitely many
prime numbers.
These two aspects of mathematics
have been maintained through all its
history: the stimulation of progress,
in methods and concepts, by the prac-
tical demands of life; the research
into new realms of abstract thought,
motivated only by the researcher's
judgment as to what was important
or "elegant", aesthetically satisfying.
One might expect that these differ-
ing tendencies would lead to forma-
tion of two kinds of mathematics:
practical (or "useful") mathematics
and abstract (or "useless") mathema-
tics. Yet this has never been the case.
The study of concrete applications
has led to major progress in develop-
ing abstract concepts: the calculus
arose from Newton's studies in mech-
anics; Fourier series were discovered
by Fourier in work on heat conduc-
tion. Similarly, the supposedly most
abstract, pure mathematics has again
and again been discovered to be of
major importance for very real physi-
cal problems: four dimensional
geometry, long considered an oddity,
became very practical with the devel-
opment of relativity theory; even
infinite-dimensional geometry was dis-
covered to be of fundamental signifi-
cance for quantum physics.
In this article I shall illustrate some
of the recent occurrences of such in-
terplay between pure and applied
mathematics. The one point which
they all demonstrate is that the recent
brilliant advances in technology have
put great pressure on engineers to
master mathematical tools previously
regarded as far removed from the
practical world.
Differential Equations
We consider the following prob-
lem:
Find a function x = f (t) such that
&amp;+b(x'-|)*f+x= o
where b is a given constant. If b is
o, we find: x = c,cos t + c, sin t,
where c, and c2 are arbitrary con-
stants. For b =^ o, we find ourselves
in trouble. The equation (1) is a
differential equation, Van der Pol's
equation, and we are in trouble be-
cause the equation is nonlinear. None
of the known methods give us the
solutions exactly and in usable form.
Approximate methods can be applied
and ultimately do provide all the de-
sired information about Eq. (1). A
tremendous amount of effort has been
expended on this equation, in the
hope of fully understanding its solu-
tions and of showing the way to at-
tack similar problems.
Van der Pol's equation arises in
studying electric circuits containing
vacuum tubes. Other problems in
electric circuits and mechanics lead
to far more complicated nonlinear
differential equations. The problems
are occurring with rapidly increasing
frequency in practical situations.
The mathematical theory of non-
linear differential equations has been
progressing slowly, with a recent
acceleration because of the new de-
mands in engineering. Notable contri-
butions have been made in the soviet
Union and in the United States, es-
pecially in connection with stability
theory.
The "imaginary" numbers
a + b
were first introduced to satisfy a pure
mathematician's whim that every
quadratic equation should have two
solutions. Centuries of study have
shown these numbers to be essential
for understanding the major part of
the operations with real numbers and
that a number of very practical prob-
lems can best be understood by use
of imaginary numbers. Thus they are
no longer a novelty in applications of
mathematics.
FEBRUARY 1963

complex numbers are continually be-
ing found and many do bear immedi-
ately on practical problems. For ex-
ample, the study of stability of
mechanical systems depends heavily
on knowledge of the complex roots of
algebraic equations. Questions on
dependence of these roots on the
coefficients of the equations are still
being investigated.
Another application of complex
numbers relates to conformal map-
ping (maps which may distort dis-
tances, but do show angles correctly).
Many problems in study of fluid mo-
tion, of electrostatic fields, of heat
conduction, of elastic deformation of
solids can be reduced to a question of
conformal mapping and hence to
finding a function of a complex vari-
able with certain specified properties.
Complex numbers have always
played a basic part in the formulation
of quantum mechanics. The crucial
Schrodinger equation is a differential
equation (in partial derivatives) for
an unknown complex function of
space variables and time. Very recent
work of Wightman and others em-
ploys complex variable theory in a
much more profound and difficult
way: through the theory of analytic
functions of several complex variables
i.e. functions representable by power
series such as
2
ojz-zf ( w- wj" .
Linear Spaces
Vectors (directed line segments) are
a familiar tool in mechanics. We learn
that two vectors can be added (par-
allellogram law) and that any vector
can be multiplied by a number
(scalar). These operations obey simple
algebraic rules:
a+ b = b + a
a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c
k (a + b) = ka + kb
h (k (a)) = (hk) a
where a, b, c are vectors, k, h are
numbers. If our vectors are in 3-di-
mensional space, then we can intro-
duce 3 coordinate axes and corre-
sponding components of the vectors
along these axes; the algebraic opera-
tions can then be carried out in terms
of the components.
After experience with vectors in
3-dimensional space, one is easily led
to generalize the concept to n-dimen-
sional space, where n is any positive
integer. There is surprisingly little
change; each vector a now has n com-
ponents and can be represented by an
n-tuple (a,, . . . , a„) in terms of a
given coordinate system. There are
many physical problems in which the
"state" (or "phase") of the system at
a given time is described by n num-
bers, which can be regarded as the
components of a vector a. The integer
n may be very large, as in the case of
a gas formed of N molecules (for ex-
ample, N = 10-'3), whose state vector
requires n = fiN numbers (coordin-
ates and velocity components of all
molecules). The vector concept turns
out to be a valuable one for treating
such problems, in particular in con-
nection with differential equations.
Our set of vectors a, b, ... in n-
dimensional space form an n-dimen-
sional vector-space. Let a second such
space be given, of in dimensions, the
vectors being denoted by a', b', . . . If
to each of the vectors a, b, . . . we
assign one of the vectors a', b', . . . by
a rule: x" = T (x), then we say that
T is a transformation of the first
vector space into the second. A trans-
formation is analogous to a function,
the independent and dependent varia-
bles being vectors instead of numbers.
The transformation T is called linear
if it obeys the law:
T(k,x + k,x) = k,T(x) + k„T(Y).
Let T be a linear transformation
and let coordinate systems be chosen
in the two spaces, so that the vectors
x, x' are represented by n-tuples (x„
. . . , xn) and m-tuples (x„ .... x'm).
Then we find that the components
are related by equations of form
=2a,
•I
m
The quantities a(J can be regarded as
the elements of an m X n matrix
Q2I QrA.
a„, a
=0
The theory of matrices has been very
highly developed and is an essential
tool in studying vector spaces. Most
important is the question of the
eigenvalues of a square matrix A
(m = n). These are the solutions of
the algebraic equation of degree n:
Equotations of this form arise in a
multitude of physical problems, most
commonly in studying the oscillations
near an equilibrium state; the solu-
tions X„ . . . , A„ may then be pure
imaginary, X, — i/J,, . . . , An = ij8„,
where /8„ . . . , /?„ are the frequencies
of the oscillations occurring.
We can generalize the concept of
vector space by ignoring any restric-
tion to n-dimensional space and treat-
ing as vectors any set of objects which
can be added and multiplied by num-
bers, following the same rules as for
familiar vectors. In particular, the set
must include a zero vector. Such a
set, with the operations mentioned,
forms a linear space. Important ex-
amples, are found in "spaces of func-
tions." For example, let our set consist
of all continuous functions f, g, . . . of
a real variable t for 0 g t g 1. The
sum of two such functions: f (t) +
g (t) is clearly a third member of the
A=
a„ a,2 a,3
om, ame a
a.
set; a constant times a function: kf(t)
is also in the set. Hence our functions
do form a linear space. Many other
linear spaces of functions can be de-
fined and find applications: the set of
bounded functions, the set of inte-
grate functions, the set of square-
integrable functions, and so on.
Linear transformations can be de-
fined as above for arbitrary linear
spaces. For example, the operation ol
differentiation is a linear transforma-
tion in the linear space of differentia-
ble functions for 0 &lt; t g 1: T[f] =
F, where F(t) = df/dt. We cannot in
general use matrices to describe such
transformations, in particular because
function spaces normally have infinite
dimension, and we could at best use
matrices with infinitely many rows
and columns; even this does not usu-
ally work very well. However, the
eigenvalue problem mentioned above
has its counterpart: We seek all A
such that T [f] = X f, for some f not
0. Here T is a linear transformation
of a given linear space into itself. In
most applications, the scalers of the
linear space are allowed to be com-
plex numbers, and correspondingly
the eigenvalues A may be real or com-
plex.

appears throughout physics: in the
vibrations of a string, a membrane, or
any continuous medium; in the spec-
tra of atoms and molecules; in elec-
tromagnetic theory; in optics; in
quantum mechanics. The mathema-
tical questions raised by the applica-
tions have only partly been answered
and are the subject of continuing re-
search.
Very recently, engineers studying
complicated problems of automatic
control have been led to the point of
view of linear spaces and linear trans-
formations. Thus a field of mathema-
tics, hitherto considered far removed
from electric networks and similar
subjects, has been found to be very
relevant.
It should be noted that operational
calculus and theory of Fourier and
Laplace transforms all come under
the heading of linear spaces and are
best understood in this setting. The
operational calculus was inverted by
Heaviside, an engineer, to treat both
ordinary and partial differential equa-
tions. In this theory it is shown to be
possible to treat operations involving
differentiation and integration for-
mally by rules of algebra. For exam-
ple, D is used for differentiation, D-
for second derivative, 1/D for inte-
gration. Then such identities as the
following, after proper interpretation,
are shown to be valid: D- — 1 =
(D - 1) (D + 1).
An important tool in the opera-
tional calculus is the impulse func-
tion g (t), also known as the Dirac
delta function. This "function" is
required to equal 0 for t ^ 0, to
equal oo for t = 0, and to be such that
/; &lt;r (t) d t = i
These properties appear to be with-
out sense. Yet for many years engi-
neers and physicists worked success-
fully with such functions. It is only
in the last 15 years, through the work
of Schwartz, Lighthill, Mikusinski,
Korevaar and others, that the ideas
have been put on a second basis
through "generalized functions" or
"distributions."
Higher Algebra
The theory of finite-dimensional
vector spaces, referred to above, is a
part of higher algebra of much im-
portance in applications. There are
many other branches of algebra, some
very new, of value in physics and en-
gineering. Group theory is probably
the most important. A group is an
algebraic structure having an opera-
tion of multiplication satisfying the
same rules as ordinary multiplication,
with the possible exception of the
commutative law: ab = ba. Groups
occur very commonly in connection
with symmetries of geometric forms.
Such symmetries are very important
in quantum mechanics, where group
theory is extensively applied.
Another algebraic topic of recent
importance is Boolean algebra. This
originated as an algebra of proposi-
tions in logic, has a parallel interpre-
tation as an algebra of classes or sets,
and is now of much value for study-
ing switching circuits and digital
computers.
Algebra plays a role in computa-
tional problems in a variety of ways.
Linear programming is a systematiza-
tion of the problem of minimizing
a linear function of several variables,
subject to given inequalities. Prob-
lems of this type arise naturally in
industrial planning. The theory of
digital computers, especially the most
recent developments such as computer
languages, involves algebraic methods
extensively. Matrices, determinants,
continued fractions, theory of equa-
tions and a variety of other classical
parts of algebra are being steadily
developed and applied to new engi-
neering problems.
Topology
This subject arose as a branch of
geometry in which only the shapes of
figures, not their actual sizes or pro-
portions, were taken into account.
Over the past hundred years it has
had a phenomenal development and
has become a central part of mathe-
matics. The subject has seemed far
removed from applications. Yet topo-
logical reasoning has been appearing
more and more often in the most
diverse problems of science: in auto-
matic control, in celestial mechanics,
in electromagnetic fields, in statistical
mechanics, in electric networks. For
the last two topics mentioned, one
branch of topology has assumed ma-
jor importance: the theory of graphs.
A graph is simply a configuration
formed of curvilinear arcs which meet
only at certain junction points. In
statistical mechanics it is important
to know how many different graphs
(from the point of view of topology)
can be formed from a given number
of arcs; the same question arises in
chemistry, in connection with classifi-
cation of compounds. For the theory
of electric networks it is important to
know relationships between the closed
circuits contained in a graph.
Measure Theory
The theory of integration received
remarkable impetus about 1900
through the work of the mathematic-
ian Lebesgue, who introduced the
Lebesgue measure and integral. Many
subtle questions concerning improper
integrals, multiple integrals, passage
to the limit under the integral sign,
and cencerning real functions in gen-
eral were clarified by this new ap-
proach. An important novelty was
that of asserting that a function f (x)
had a property "almost everywhere,"
that is, except for a set of values of
x having measure zero. A set of meas-
ure zero may contain infinitely many
values, but must somehow be very
thin; an example is the set of rational
numbers.
The theory of Lebesgue was soon
generalized widely. Its relation to the
theory of probability was recognized
and put on a firm basis by Kolmo-
goroff. The events to which one
assigns probabilities are associated
with sets in a measure space, each set
having a measure between 0 and 1.
The rules governing probabilities for
combinations of events then corre-
spond to basic properties of the meas-
ure.
Scientific problems concerned with
probability have become more and
more frequent. In statistical mechan-
ics, one finds probability essential in
determining average velocities of
molecules and related quantities, the
thermodynamic concepts of en trophy
and temperature turn out to be based
on probability. Quantum mechanics
is phrased in terms of probability to
start with. Many processes, such as
chemical reactions and flow of traffic,
are best regarded as random processes,
and analyzed through probability. In-
formation theory is a recent applica-
tion of probability to the problem of
communication. In all these applica-
tions, some knowledge of the under-
lying measure theory is needed.
The familiar question: "What is
the quickest route from here to down-
town?" poses a problem of the calcu-
lus of variations. One is trying to
choose a path which minimizes a cer-
tain number (the time required)
which depends on the path. Such

The various fields of engineering have
advanced by leaps and bounds. Mean-
while, medicine and the biological sci-
ences have also rapidly progressed. With
the advent of bio-chemistry and, more
recently, bio-physics, the possibilities of a
new field, bio-engineering, became in-
creasingly evident. Today bio-engineering
is growing by leaps and bounds.
In his perpetual effort to improve
his environment and his general lot
in life, man has been naturally in-
clined to study and develop the many
branches of the physical and biologi-
cal sciences. When man discovers an
untraveled route in science or finds a
problem that he cannot solve, he inte-
grates the principles of the sciences
more familiar to him and creates a
new science. For centuries man has
explored the physical and biological
sciences separately, but only in recent
years has he attempted to integrate
these two main branches of science.
The product of this cross fertilization
has resulted in the discipline called
bio-engineering.
What are the problems that caused
this new field of engineering to
evolve? The Chemical, Mechanical,
and Aeronautical engineers, under-
stand and are able to solve problems
involving chemical processes, heat
transfer, energy release, fluid How,
and their controls in engineering sys-
tems. How can he apply his knowl-
edge to the many physiological sys-
tems that involve the same processes?
To answer this question, the engineer
must have a working knowledge of
the biological sciences in addition to
his knowledge of the physical sci-
ences.
The Electrical and Instrumentation
engineers are acquainted with the
theories of circuitry, computers, and
the measurement of non-linear system
behavior that is also exhibited by the
biological system. The need for phys-
iological data requires the best instru-
mentation the technology of electron-
ics can conceive, and is constantly
increasing. The Electrical and Instru-
mentation engineers can obviously do
much for the biological sciences.
The Materials engineer is con-
cerned with inanimate materials.
How can he use his knowledge in the
materials of the biological systems?
The Industrial engineer knows how
to design and develop more efficient
and more practical operations. How
can he apply his knowledge to the
biological sciences?
Questions such as these caused the
creation of the field of bio-engineer-
ing, a cross breed of the physical and
biological sciences. The ultimate goal
of the bio-engineer is to discover, un-
derstand, and apply the general laws
involving [both living and inanimate
systems] (for the benefit of mankind).
Bio-Engineering at the University
Here at the University of Michigan,
the Bio-Engineering Program began
in 1952 when the University began
training students as combination spe-
cialists in bacteriology, bio-chemistry,
and chemical engineering. This
course of study was confined to the
graduate level for several years and
by 1961 approximately five Ph.D.'s
were graduated from the program.
Within the past year the original nar-
row concept has expanded greatly to
include not only students from the
Engineering College, but students
from other colleges in the University
as well.
Bio-Engineering was offered as a
program leading to a degree in the
22


expanded context lor the first time
during the fall semester of 1962. Un-
dergraduate students entering this
program are expected to take the pre-
requisites to the advanced biological
and medical sciences, such as biology,
bacteriology, organic and physical
chemistry, and comparative biology,
in addition to their regular engineer-
ing courses. The faculty plans to al-
low the students to plan their own
course of study as they advance in the
program. Because of this, the areas of
study that will lead to a degree in
Bio-Engineering have been greatly
diversified. The goal of the graduate
students will be to conduct research
on biological and physical systems
from an engineering point of view.
Several research projects in this
field are being conducted or have
been conducted at the University of
Michigan as well as elsewhere. In one
study it was learned that gamma rays
could be used to lengthen the refrig-
erated life of fresh foods. Preliminary
studies showed that dosages of radia-
tion large enough to sterilize the food
products tended to give undesirable
odors and flavors to the food. How-
ever, it was found that doses equal to
1 or 2 per cent of the sterilizing dos-
age destroyed 90 to 99-(- per cent of
the bacteria in the food without pro-
ducing undesirable changes. Items
such as hamburger that would nor-
mally begin to spoil within a few days
could be made to last a week before
the bacterial population becomes ex-
cessive.
Another project involved the use
of gamma rays to sterilize meat that
had been inoculated with spores.
Ground beef was inoculated with
various dosages of Clostridium bottdi-
num spores and subjected to radia-
tion. The meat was then incubated
and tested for culture growths. The
samples that had had sufficient dos-
ages of radiation were sterile. Radia-
tion was also used to sterilize bone
transplants and pasteurize whole
eviscerated chickens. Complementary
effects of heat and radiation on food
microorganisms have been investi-
gated, too.
In the Mechanical Engineering De-
partment studies in prosthetics and
orthodics have been conducted. Since
World War II interest has increased
in this area because of the great num-
ber of people that were crippled dur-
ing the war. Various methods of brac-
ing crippled limbs were studied in an
effort to find the way that would give
the patient the most freedom of move-
ment.
The Industrial Engineering De-
partment has a number of projects at
the University Hospital. Surgical sup-
ply costing, central service inventory,
and catheterization sets are being
studied in an effort to cut cost and in-
crease efficiency and practicality. A
study is being made to find the best
ways to stock and distribute phar-
maceutical products. Other projects
involve material control, patient
transportation, and patient census.
In another project the basic differ-
ential equations relating the pressure,
momentum, and position of the
blood in the arteries with respect to
time were derived. With the aid of
computers, engineers can use these
equations to locate possible obstruc-
tions or weak points in the cardiovas-
cular system by comparing the
velocity, pressure, and flow rates in
the arteries.
Bio-Engineering Projects
A great number of studies are be-
ing conducted at other universities,
various industrially sponsored re-
search centers, and in some branches
of the armed forces. For example in
Tubingen, Germany, four scientists
devoted several years to a seemingly
trivial study of the responses of a
beetle to moving light patterns. From
this study they were able to design
some radically new ground-speed in-
dicators for airplanes.
At the U. S. Air Force Cambridge
Laboratories a study of the anatomy
of human speech was conducted. A
procedure was devised to detect ma-
lignant growths in the larynx. In this
procedure the patient would have his
voice recorded, while he was reading
standard phrases. The speech wave-
form could then be studied and com-
pared with characteristic patterns to
detect the existence of growths.
Hig-speed equipment is required
for the accurate measurement and
analysis of the mechanical events in
active muscle. Engineers developed
instruments that can provide informa-
tion to specify completely both tran-
sient and steady-state mechanical
properties of muscle. A hydraulic
servo-valve, controlled by analog
units, can be used to control the
speed of shortening of muscle at rates
as high as one millimeter per milli-
second. Force on the muscle can be
measured by a strain gauge with high
natural frequency and low compli-
ance. An error indicator is fed a sig-
nal proportional to the measured
force and in turn controls the servo-
valve piston. Constant forces can be
maintained in this manner.
Realizing that anesthetics and the
exposure of the heart affect cardiac
function, engineers have devised ways
of gathering information about the
function and control of the heart

COMPUTING CENTER
Two views of the University Computing Center showing the tape units which
comprise an important part of the computer's memory system, the two channel
consoles (a) and main console (b).
The first digital computer was an im-
practical mechanical device invented over
a century ago by an Englishman. With
the development of modern electronic
technology, the computer became a prac-
tical tool and is presently indispensable
in enginering research and development.
The University's computing center has
grown with the computer and exempli-
fies its use in today's technological world.
To many people computing ma-
chines typify the technological pro-
gress of this modern world, but the
basic construction was proposed and
attempted more than a century ago
by an Englishman named Charles
Babbage. Babbage's "analytic engine,"
as he called the device, stored num-
bers by the rotary positioning of
wheels. The wheels were then geared
together by a controlling machanism
in such a way that the sums and
differences were stored also in the
rotary position of the wheels. It is
true that the practical implementa-
tion of such devices was postponed
until the electronic technology of two
decades ago permitted the storage of
numbers by electric current rather
than mechanical positioning. The
construction of the ENIAC computer
was started during World War II to
facilitate the computation of trajec-
tory tables (fire control tables) for
various ballistic weapons. This elec-
tronic computer represented a deci-
mal digit by ten vacuum tubes, only
one of which was conducting at any
given time. The instructions, which
24

CENTER

this primitive computer executed in
sequence, were actually wired in a
patch-panel fashion. The success of
ENIAC initiated the development of
several successors whose instructions,
or program, were stored internally as
numbers. Among these machines was
SEAC, constructed by the National
Bureau of Standards; and it was in
this era (about 1950) that the Univer-
sity began to use, and then to con-
struct, such digital machines.
A Decade of Development
The design of the original Bomarc
missile (Boeing and Michigan Aero-
nautical Research Corporation) was
carried out in part by using the SEAC
machine. The 35 simultaneous differ-
ential equations describing control
were numerically solved using nstruc-
tions and data written as hexadecimal
numbers (base 16). In those prim-
eval days, no computer run was ever
attempted unless the program was in-
dependently compared to the prob-
lem statement by another program-
mer. Computing time was precious
and almost any amount of human
effort was justified to verify the pro-
gram. At this same time, plans were
under way at the Willow Run Labo-
ratories to construct a machine, simi-
lar in design to the SEAC, which
became known as MIDAC (Michi-
gan Digital Automatic Computer).
This machine could store 512 num-
bers in its delay line storage and be-
came operational in 1953. The
University also installed, in conjunc-
tion with its conventional punched
card equipment, an IBM CPC (Card
Programmed Calculator) in 1952.
This first commercial machine was a
marriage of existing punched card
equipment with a very limited elec-
tro-mechanical storage and with in-
structions read from cards. The lim-
ited mechanical storage was a serious
shortcoming and one of the first uses
of magnetic core storage was as a
replacement of these devices in diis
machine. The resulting configuration,
the IBM 797, was never produced
commercially, but a version of this
machine is installed in the Depart-
ment of Electrical Engineering for
experimental and teaching purposes.
Without exception, the pioneers in
the field of digital computing were
convinced that the new tool would
have a dramatic influence on all of
the sciences and that, due to this wide
application, the techniques of using
such machines should be included in
the educational curriculum . The
MIDAC machine was used in a
limited way for instructional pur-
poses, but the means of financial sup-
port of the machine and the some-
what precarious technology of that
era machine did not permit the in-
volvement of very many students. In
195G the IBM Corporation instituted
an educational program where in-
structional use of their machines was
subsidized by the corporation. The
first computer used on this basis was
installed in the University's Statistical
Research Center. The basic storage of
this machine was a continuously ro-
tating drum on whose surface small
local magnets could be "written" and
subsequently "read". The storage,
with a capacity of 2000 ten-digit deci-
mal numbers, contained both the
numbers used as arithmetic operands
and the instructions to carry out the
computation; each operation re-
quired several milliseconds to com-
plete. Information was read into the
computer from punched cards and
punched cards were produced as out-
put. Even at the time of installation,
it was known that a machine of this
size and speed could not meet the
needs of the University on a long-
term basis. However, this simple, reli-
able machine did provide the means
to introduce a large number of the
University's faculty to the capabilities
of digital machines, and it permitted
some valuable experimentation in the
teaching of digital techniques. One of
the things that these experiments il-
lustrated is that the form of sequences
of instructions to solve a particular
problem are very dependent upon the
specific machine to be used. The
pedagogical implication is that teach-
ing can easily tend to become a rela-
tion of the details of a particular
manufacturer's equipment. Moreover,
in this period of rapid development,
equipment is short-lived and this de-
pendence makes the courses lack con-

EDUCATION
by Prof. Edward L. Page
There is much confusion today re-
garding the relative roles of engineering
and science in our society. Where does
science stop and engineering begin?
When a missile succeeds, is it really a
scientific success' And when it fails, is it
really an engineering failure? This article
attempts to define and clarify the im-
portance and difference of the two dis-
ciplines.
There is confusion between what
constitutes engineering and how it
differs from science. This confusion is
not confined to the layman, or any
particular area, as it is world wide,
and exists even among faculty mem-
bers of schools of engineering. But, it
is a situation that should not exist be-
cause there is a distinct difference be-
tween science and engineering that
needs to be universally recognized.
The purpose of this article is to make
the difference clear and to indicate
how this difference influences engi-
neering education.
Science seeks new knowledge, or
the explanation of phenomenon. Sci-
ence seeks to discover or to "know
why." Thus, science is inherently in-
volved with the newest developments.
Such seeking of knowledge is predom-
inatly achieved by analysis, by isola-
tion of effects, and by a high degree
of intense specialization to considera-
ble depth in a relatively narrow field
of knowledge. Scientists seek knowl-
edge with a minimum of restriction
as to cost, time, weight, space, form
or other limitations. Even when scien-
tists must make "scientific applica-
tions" of their knowledge, they are
largely free of rigid restrictions. In
fact, they must seek results unham-
pered by compromise or they cannot
function effectively.
Engineering seeks the practical ap-
plication of the physical sciences. En-
gineering is concerned with "know
how" and achieving of predetermined
objectives in the application of the
physical sciences. There is an inherent
time lag between discovery of knowl-
edge and its application. Thus, engi-
neers are not primarily concerned
with the latest scientific discoveries
until the need for their practical ap-
plication has become evident. Natu-
rally, a reasonably up-to-date knowl-
edge of the physical sciences is
important. Engineers seek to combine
many facets, that is, to synthesize and
integrate knowledge, rather than to
analyze and isolate it. The "practical"
application of knowledge means that
engineers must convert relatively use-
less knowledge into a useable form.
This conversion is confined by rela-
tively strict limitations that involve
decisions and compromise as to time,
cost, weight, space, shape, etc. and re-
quires a breadth of knowledge some
of which can only be obtained by ex-
perience. The engineer is also con-
cerned with "know whether," making
decisions as to which of the various
possible alternatives should be se-
lected to achieve the predetermined
objectives. All this synthesis, integra-
tion, and compromise is the "design"
function of engineering. It is this de-
sign function that differentiates engi-
neering from all other endeavors.
Faculty members of foreign engi-
neering schools have made statements
such as the following: "It is not the
function of an engineering professor
to be concerned with the application
of what he teaches. It is his function
to advance the frontier of knowledge"
"Engineers are just out-dated scien-
tists that have not kept up with the
times." Clearly, both these professors,
one in Japan and one in Brazil, did
not realize that engineering is not the
discovery of knowledge, but the prac-
tical application of that which has al-
ready been discovered.
This confusion about science and
engineering has been so wide-spread
that it has hampered the development
of good engineering programs. There-
fore, essentially the following was
prepared, when the author was in
Brazil under the U.S. foreign aid pro-
gram, to help bring about a better
understanding of engineering. It
should be noted that various quota-
tions of a number of men eminent in
the field of engineering have been
extensively used to emphasize that the
opinions expressed are not those
merely of the one author. The Jour-
nal of Engineering Education is the
logical and major source of these
quotations.
The subject discussed is highly con-
troversial and numerous other articles
and quotations could be compiled
from the same journal that might pre-
sent quite a different point of view.
Thus, those who are excessively sci-
ence oriented may take issue with the
following. However, from extensive
reading of BOTH sides of the contro-
versy, it seems evident that there is
now emerging in U.S. engineering
education a definite trend toward
FEBRUARY 1963
27


ences and the great importance of en-
gineering.
There has been a tendency to dis-
count engineering due to the current
glamor and high prestige associated
with science. This is well illustrated
by a successful satellite launching be-
ing hailed as "a scientific achieve-
ment" but an unsuccessful satellite
launching is deemed "an engineering
failure." The fact is, most of the
achievements in space technology are
the result of the application of the
physical sciences within strict limita-
tions—in short, the result of engineer-
ing.
Science is important; it is needed,
and the results of scientists are exten-
sively used by engineers. On the other
hand, engineering is equally import-
ant, just as needed, and it is definitely
more difficult to work within strict
limitations than not to do so. The re-
sults of engineering determine the
welfare of a nation, for of what value
is knowledge until it has been put
into practical application?
"The history of the Manhattan Dis-
trict has sometimes been cited as giv-
ing evidence that American engineer-
ing was somehow deficient. In this
connection it is fair to say, on the
other hand, that appraisals by Ameri-
can physicists showed that a large
majority of the ideas basic to the A-
bomb development were of foreign
origin, or originated with scientists
of foreign education; the United
States made its major contribution to
this project through its technology"1.
"Following the initial impact of
discovery of the release of atomic en-
ergy, it took almost a decade to bring
realization that the achievements of
the Manhattan District Project and
early work under Atomic Energy
Commission auspices represented no
striking, basic scientific research ac-
complishment by this country but
rather the application on an enor-
mous scale of its great technological
know-how and capacity"2. That is,
our atomic and nuclear accomplish-
ments are the result of engineering.
Engineering seems to have been
downgraded because of the glamor of
discovery, because the mistakes of en-
gineering are more obvious in prod-
ucts, perhaps, than those the scientists
may make in the laboratory, and be-
cause educators, confusing science and
engineering, have misapplied the edu-
cational standard of advanced degrees
which apply to science, but which do
not apply to the practical application
of science—engineering.
"The place of engineers and engi-
neering in our society and, particular-
ly, the part which engineering plays
in sustaining and enhancing our na-
tional productivity and standard of
living is a subject which deserves
especial attention during this period
of international stress"1.
The close relationship between en-
gineering and productivity has been
noted by many foreign observers. One
such study "leads inescapably to the
conclusion that lor a given (world)
level of fundamental scientific knowl-
edge, a major influence on the long
term trend of productivity is the rate
at which applied scientists and engi-
neers are trained and used in indus-
try"3.
"Through the design of structures,
circuits, machines, and processes, and
the design of systems and plants, engi-
neers provide the major means by
which the productivity of labor is in-
creased and the general standard of
living raised. . . . Engineering as an
activity will continue, grow in impor-
tance, so long as mankind survives on
this earth. ... A reexamination, ob-
jectively made, would lead to the re-
instatement of design as the central
and unifying theme"1.
Specialization is necessary in engi-
neering as in science, but not to the
same extent. Since it is the prime pur-
pose of engineers to synthetize com-
ponents into an integrated whole, the
engineer cannot be as narrow a spe-
cialist, as can be die scientist. How-
ever, due to the wide expanse of phy-
sical knowledge, beyond the capabili-
ties of any one person to comprehend,
a measure of specialization is neces-
sary, but, it should not be divided up
into such small fragments that engi-
neers become restricted to very nar-
row fields. Thus, we have the broad
fields of chemical, civil, electrical, in-
dustrial, and mechanical engineering.
Mistakes have been made in the
past in regard to engineering educa-
tion. That is, scientists got so far
ahead on engineering knowledge that
"scientists had to pitch in to engineer
such advanced devices as nuclear re-
actors, radar, rockets, computers, and
much else"4. Also, specialization was
carried too far, and specific current
techniques and practices were empha-
sized rather than "the engineering ap-
proach" using basic principles. But,
the attempts to correct these faults
apparently have gone too far. Science
has been emphasized to the point that
some schools of engineering have lost
sight of engineering and so cut down
on application courses and design
that they have ended in not training
engineers, but scientists.
"M.I.T. is in the midst of revising
its whole concept of scientific and
technological education, particularly
the core area of engineering. The aim
is to increase greatly the scientific
standards of engineers in order to
keep up with science, and at the same
time retain engineer's practicality.
This dual goal cannot be achieved
by making engineers scientists or vice
versa".
"Draper, Head of the Department
of Aeronautics and Astronautics, . . .
believes that the trend toward more
theoretical science in engineering
since 1930 has gone too far. . . . 'We
believe you can't be a football player
without playing any football!' Other
department are losing balance reject-
ing the engineering side"4.
"Engineering in British Universi-
ties is almost synonymous with physi-
cal science. The distinction between
engineering and scientific method is
largely unknown, . . . but a few objec-
tions have been made to our one-
sided analytical type of education.
Professor A. J. Francis has criticized
the philosophy that engineering stu-
dents should be insulated as far as
possible from the practice of engi-
neering, and he has written, design
work is being drastically curtailed,
and practical experience is said to be
almost a liability when one applies
for a university post. He traces this
mistaken philosophy of the English-
speaking countries to the influence of
the Massachusetts Institute of Tech-
nology and contrasts it with the em-
phasis placed on design in the West
German Technische Hochschulen. He
goes on to assert that it is this empha-
sis on education for design which has
made the quality of West German
structural engineering far superior to
that of Britain or the U.S.A."
"Dr. B. V. Bowden, Principal of the
Manchester College of Science and
Technology, said at a recent confer-
ence . . . 'The continental technical
universities have long since accepted
the principle that there are many
subjects the essence of which resides
not inside but outside the university
world. They accepted that just as it
is unreasonable to find a professor of
surgery who has never practiced re-

COMPLEX 39, CAPE CANAVERAL
New moon flight facilities for Project Apollo, shown in the artist's rendering above, are now underway. The main
structure, standing over 500 feet high and covering an area of more than 10 acres, will enclose the greatest volume of
any known building, 130,000,000 cubic feet. Its 45-story doors will open into one of the building's four erection bays where
the Saturn C-5 rocket will be assembled and checked out. When assembled, the C-5 will stand 360 feet high and weigh
300 tons. After checkout is completed, a large crawler transporter (shown at the left) will move into the bay, lift the whole
assembly and carry it three miles to the launch pad. The C-5 will be checked out from the Launch Control Center (right),
a separate four story building which will house the launch control facilities. The design of the complex was submitted by
four engineering firms known as Urbahn-Roberts-Seelye-Moran.

PLASMA FURNACE
One of the latest developments in the steel-
making industry is the Plasmarc furnace shown here
being operated at the Linde Company, division
of Union Carbide Corporation. The Plasmarc
torch, the cylindrical tube entering the top of this
one ton furnace, produces temperatures up to
60,000 F—four times hotter than the surface of
the sun. Use of the Plasmarc furnace eliminates
the carbon electrode used in an arc furnace and
prevents carbon pickup in the melt, making it
ideal for work with low carbon alloys. Also, by
operating the Plasmarc furnace with an inert gas,
the metal is free from impurities present from
oxygen, nitrogen and other contaminants in the
conventional arc furnace.

This 155mm howitzer shell is shown

The glamour and excitement of space age programs often obscure a fundamental fact. It is simply
that farsightedness must be coupled with sound, practical, down-to-earth engineering if goals are
to be attained. This is the philosophy upon which Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft's position as a world
leader in flight propulsion systems has been built.
Almost four decades of solid engineering achievement at Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft can be credited
to management's conviction that basic and applied research is essential to healthy progress. In
addition to concentrated research and development efforts on advanced gas turbine and rocket
engines, new and exciting effects are being explored in every field of aerospace, marine and industrial
power application.
The challenge of the future is indicated by current programs. Presently Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft
is exploring the areas of technical knowledge in magnelohydrodynamics . . . thermionic and thermo-
electric conversions . . . hypersonic propulsion . . .fuel cells and nuclear power.
If you have interests in common with us, if you look to the future but desire to take a down-to-earth
approach to get there, investigate career opportunities at Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft.
To help move tomorrow closer to today, we continually seek ambitious young engineers and scientists. Your de-
gree? It can be a B.S., M.S. or Ph.D. in: MECHANICAL • AERONAUTICAL • ELECTRICAL • CHEMICAL and
NUCLEAR ENGINEERING • PHYSICS • CHEMISTRY • METALLURGY • CERAMICS • MATHEMATICS • ENGI-
NEERING SCIENCE or APPLIED MECHANICS. The field still broadens. The challenge grows greater. And a future of
recognition and advancement may be here for you.

DEARBORN CENTER
by Michael Gordon
As a student of the University of
Michigan are you able to explain to a
person from another school what the
Dearborn Center is? Could you an-
swer the question, "What is a senior
college?" Do you know why the Dear-
born Center was built or how its co-
op program operates? If you are a
student of the University of Michigan
and you can't answer any or all of
these questions you probably have
plenty of company. However, this
does not excuse your ignorance. The
answers to these questions mixed with
some interesting facts are contained
in this special article about the Dear-
born Center.
Why a Dearborn Center?
A few years ago studies were made
to determine the future personnel
needs of key firms in Southeastern
Michigan. Basically these studies re-
vealed the existance of a three-fold
manpower problem:
1. There was an insufficient num-
ber of qualified professional
personnel.
2. There was an excessive turnover
of such personnel.
3. There was an inability to keep
instruction "current" in the
light of rapidly evolving tech-
nological changes.
As a partial solution to these prob-
lems the University created the
Dearborn Center.
A Senior College
Because the Dearborn Center is to
act as a partial solution to the man-
power problem stated above, it does
not operate in exactly the same way
as its parent campus at Ann Arbor.
First of all, the Dearborn Center is a
Senior College. This means that it
does not accept students at the
freshman and sophomore levels. In
order to be admitted you must be at
least a junior. Secondly the school
operates on a year-round basis. It was
the first campus in the state of Michi-
gan to adopt the trimester system.
Third it offers to most of its students
a work-study program commonly
known as a co-op program.
Although located 35 miles east of
Ann Arbor the Dearborn Center still
maintains the standards of the Uni-
versity of Michigan. The status of its
students and faculty are the same.
They can withdraw books, attend
concerts, plays, art exhibits, sports
events and other functions at the Ann
Arbor campus. It maintains the same
admission requirements and grants
the same degrees. It has the same in-
structional objectives both in quality
and quantity and expects the same
conduct from its students.
The Dearborn Center offers degrees
in three fields: Business Administra-
tion, Engineering and Literature Sci-
ence and the Arts. Teacher certificates
are available through the L.S.&amp;A. pro-
gram.
Co-Op Program
The work-study or co-op program
is available to students in both busi-
ness administration and engineering.
Students who are part of the program
work as full time employees in indus-
try or business every other term. The
job assignments are carefully set up
on the basis of their educational
value. The students are paid regular
wages and in many cases are self sup-
porting. Plans are currently being
made to extend the co-op program
into some fields of the L. S. &amp; A.
division.

The modern classroom facilities found at the Dearborn Center are surrounded by
a beautifully landscaped campus.

Looks like a scene at the UGLI? The Dearborn Center's modern and spacious library
facilities are in constant use by the students.
Business Administration
The Division of Business Adminis-
tration provides education and expe-
rience designed for persons who are
aiming at leadership positions. The
curriculum stresses economic prin-
ciples, the tools of accounting, and
statistics and includes the basic gen-
eralizations which research and busi-
ness practice have shown to be useful
in the management of a business en-
terprise. Students spend their co-op
or internship terms in one of the
major subdivisions of business or in-
dustry. These include accounting, in-
dustrial relations, sales, and purchas-
ing. The facilities, location and rela-
tionship with business and industry
existing at the Dearborn Center make
possible a fruitful exchange between
the student of business and the prac-
titioner. At the present time the stu-
dents enrolled in the Division of Busi-
ness Administration come from 12
junior colleges and 18 four-year col-
leges. The greatest number have
transferred from the Ann Arbor
campus.
Literature Science and the Arts
The Division of Literature Science
and the Arts attempts to increase the
students awareness of the modes of
self-expression. The liberal arts cur-
riculum is divided into three groups:
the Humanities, the Social Sciences
and the Physical and Biological Sci-
ences. One third of the Dearborn
Center campus is devoted to the liber-
al arts program. The classes are noted
for their comparative smallness. The
close faculty contact possible on this
small campus minimizes the growth
of departmentalization thereby pro-
viding the basis for a balanced and
coherent liberal arts program. In ad-
dition to the regular daytime pro-
gram, night classes are offered
through the University of Michigan
Extension Service and the Division of
Adult Education which is jointly
sponsored by Michigan and Wayne
State Universities.
Engineering
The objective of the Division of
Engineering is also to prepare stu-
dents to take positions of leadership.
It offers Bachelor of Science in Engi-
neering degrees in four fields, each
co-operative with industry. The fields
are Electrical Engineering, Mechani-
cal Engineering, Industrial Engineer-
ing and Engineering Mechanics.
Twenty-two firms take part in the
co-op program. The engineering co-
op student works every other term.
During a working term his pay
check averages $101 a week and dur-
ing the past summer period he aver-
aged $2.53 per hour and had a total
gross earning for the summer period
of $1,700. A recent survey showed
that the job assignments enabled 53%
of the co-op engineers to be entirely
self-supporting. However, the pay
check phase of the co-op program is
only incidental, the job assignments
are set up on the basis of their value
in the instructional program.
During the last semester 50 co-op
engineers were on work assignments.
Most of the companies they worked
for were in Michigan although three
were in other states. The companies
involved produced a variety of prod-
ucts ranging from trucks and cameras
to computers and control systems.
Several of the organizations were
principally interested in research.
There are two methods of placing
an engineering student with a co-op
employer. Some companies send
representatives to the campus. These
representatives conduct personal in-
terviews with students interested in
co-op employment with their com-
pany. Other companies communicate
their job requirements, in detail, to
the Dearborn Center Coordinator of
Engineering. The Coordinator deter-
mines which students are qualified for
the job. These students are then inter-
viewed by the co-op employer. In
either case the offering of employ-
ment rests with the co-op employer
and the acceptance of the employ-
ment rests with the student.

It's just one part of the
cement industry's research facility
Of vital interest to many graduating engineers are the
$10,000,000 Research and Development Laboratories
of the Portland Cement Association. Here in suburban
Skokie, Illinois, near Chicago, is the world's largest as-
sembly of engineers, scientists and equipment devoted
exclusively to the study of portland cement and concrete.
In the Fire Research Center's huge furnace pictured
above, full size beams and girders are subjected to lick-
ing flames from gas jets. Other furnaces subject whole
floor sections to hours of intense heat.
In the nearby Structural Laboratory, the building it-
self serves as a giant testing machine for entire bridge
sections. In still another laboratory, a machine capable
of exerting a force of a million pounds bears down on a
foot-thick concrete cylinder until it literally explodes.
Some of the research is fundamental—designed to in-
crease basic knowledge of the nature of portland cement
and concrete. Other projects are directed to development
of new and improved uses of these materials. Still other
projects are devoted to the processes of manufacture of
portland cement—to help assure a uniform, high-quality
product, whatever the source.
In this way, the more than 75 progressive (and com-
peting) cement manufacturers who voluntarily support
the Association work together to provide scientific data
and design information that are freely given to America's
engineers and builders through PCA's district offices,
located in major cities of North America and in Hawaii.
The results of this research enable engineers to design
and build concrete structures of even greater safety, en-
durance and economy.

NASA. .. your place in space
NASA programs encourage swift professional growth
for the engineer or scientist launching his career
You can accelerate your career swiftly
as a professional staff member of the Na-
tional Aeronautics and Space Administra-
tion. Stimulating assignments, unequaled
resources, liberal programs of educational
assistance, early responsibility—all help
hasten the professional growth of the
engineer or scientist who chooses NASA
for his initial career position.
Each NASA research center offers its
own comprehensive plan to help advance
your knowledge and speed the time when
you can contribute at the peak of your
capacity. The plans differ from center to
center, but this summary is generally valid
throughout the NASA complex:
NASA Installations
Maintain University Ties
NASA centers have established close
relationships with nearby universities. As
a professional staff member, you may
pursue graduate study either in the even-
ing at NASA's expense or during regular
working hours on full salary. And, if
necessary to fulfill university requirements
for a graduate degree, you may become a
resident student, also on full salary.

NASA encourages advanced study in
astronautics, physics, electronics, chemis-
try, metallurgy, mathematics, astronomy,
and geophysics, as well as aeronautical,
mechanical, electronic, electrical, nuclear,
ceramic, and civil engineering, engineering
mechanics, and engineering physics.
Guggenheim, Sloan, Brookings
Fellowships Available
Additional avenues of opportunity will
be open to you because NASA participates

in fellowship programs of the Guggen-
heim and Sloan Foundations and the
Brookings Institution. Right now, as a
result of this participation, NASA staff
members are attending Cal Tech, M.I.T.,
Harvard, and other leading schools, re-
ceiving full salary, expenses, and per diem.
NASA helps you keep abreast of the
latest developments in your field by per-
mitting frequent attendance at major
technical conferences in this country and
abroad.
Unique Intern Programs
Increase Technical Competence
The NASA centers offer exhaustive in-
house educational opportunities as well,
including the unique Intern Programs.
The regular in-house activities include
lectures, seminars, films, and expense-paid
trips to other organizations. The Intern

Program is somewhat different. As an
Intern, you study and work closely with a
senior NASA scientist or engineer, a
leader in his—and your—field. This is an
informal and exceedingly productive
arrangement, which usually lasts for six
months. The Intern Program is designed
to bring you very rapidly to the forefront
in a special technical area.

by Bio-Engineers that there are nu-
merous paths of study available to
the student who enjoys applied re-
search in the physical and biological
sciences. Employment opportunities
are available for Bio-Engineers at all
levels of accomplishment. Govern-
ment positions are open to those who
are interested in research and have
advanced degrees. Due to the rapid
influx of students interested in the
bio-engineering field, graduates in-
terested in teaching and research are
also in demand. Industry sorely needs
Bio-Electrical engineers that can de-
velop, produce, and maintain sophis-
ticated medical electronic equipment;

knowledge of biochemistry microbiol-
ogy, computer technology, biophysics,

Medical researchers have found
ways to save thousands of lives, and
engineers have discovered numerous
devices that simplify our everyday life.
Yet science has no pump as good as
the human heart, no camera as good
as the human eye, and no computer
as good as the human brain. Can man
duplicate these God-given instru-
ments? What are the relationships be-
tween these marvelous living systems
and the inanimate systems that the
engineer already builds and professes
to understand? Among the men who
answer these questions for the future
will be the Bio-Engineers.

One indication we have of the steadily increasing competence of the die
casting industry is the amazing precision which can be cast directly
into our products. This carburetor body casting, for example, is the product of
one extremely complicated casting operation in which die segments are withdrawn in six
directions to form its many surfaces, orifices, and ducts. Thus, machine finishing is greatly
reduced. To reach and maintain this degree of excellence, the die casting industry requires
practical creative engineers . . . the kind of people who are willing to go into unexplored
areas to develop new, better solutions to ever-changing problems. If you are that kind
of engineer now ... or plan to be . . . we would appreciate receiving your resume.

more rust resistant


To tackle this assignment, Ford Motor Company
engineers turned to zinc. Galvanized, or zinc-clad,
steel has long been noted for its resistance to corro-
sion. It presented special problems which had limited
its use in automotive applications, however. It was
hard to weld, difficult to paint.
Our engineers developed special techniques to solve
the welding problem. They found a process which
eliminates the crystalline pattern on galvanized steel
and produces a surface that will accept a high-quality
paint job.
Now zinc can be married to steel and used for vital
underbody parts and rocker panels of Ford-built cars.
The zinc coating forms a tough barrier to corrosive
moisture—and if corrosion attacks, the zinc sacrifices
itself through galvanic action, saving the steel.
Other avenues explored in the fight against rust also
brought results: special zinc-rich primers to protect
key body areas, aluminized and stainless steels to
extend muffler life, quality baked-enamel finishes that
are more durable (and look better).
Another step forward in total quality—and another
example of how Ford Motor Company provides engi-
neering leadership for the American Road.

tinuity as new machines appear. It
was in this era (circa 1957) that the
IBM Corporation introduced for a
large machine the FORTRAN trans-
lation program which took the des-
cription of a problem in a statement
language and produced the numeric
machine instructions as output.
These instructions could then be exe-
cuted by the machine to solve the
problem. This first translator was a
very complicated program, as its
antecedents have been also. It seemed
rather hopeless to expect that such a

translator could be written for a
small machine like the IBM 650 be-
cause of the storage limitation, but
this feat was accomplished by a group
at Carnegie Institute of Technology.
The translating program, called IT
for Internal Translator, motivated
the subsequent development of GAT
(Generalized Algebraic Translator)
for the IBM 650 at the University. In-
cidentally, the use of designating let-
ters, or acronyms, as names is a prac-
tice (probably having its origin in
government agencies) which has been
adopted with a vengeance by the com-
puting population. The GAT lan-
guage was widely used; it was easily
learned and it permitted the descrip-
tion of computing procedures more
naturally and more concisely than
the equivalent machine instructions.
The utility of this approach for
course-connected problems was well
established when the first truly large
scale machine was installed.
The Computing Center
In 1959 the IBM 704 computer was
installed in the North University
Building as part of the IBM educa-
tional program, and the facility was
established as a separate unit of the
Graduate School. This machine was
the first of a succession of three simi-
lar machines; the succeeding ma-
chines had more built-in operations
and were considerably faster. Like all
present-day machines this group can
be very informally described by
analogy to a man operating a desk
calculator. The two adjoining dia-
grams illustrate this approach.
All three machines are binary; num-
bers are represented as a string of
zeros and ones where these two possi-
ble digits are multiplied by powers of
two instead of powers of ten as in
decimal representation. The basic
number size is 36 binary digits (or 3f&gt;
bits) which is roughly the equivalent
of ten decimal digits. As in most pres-
ent day, large scale machines, the
main storage for instructions and
data in this family is composed of
thousands of small ferro-magnctic
rings called cores. These magnetic
cores have two states of magnetization
which correspond to the binary digits
zero and one. The type 704 computer
could store 8192 36-bit numbers in its
combined storage with the possibility
of storing another 8192 on an auxil-
46
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


required 12 microseconds to record a
number in the main magnetic core
storage and a similar time to transfer
a number from storage to one of the
operand registers. This figure, called
the access time, was the same for the
succeeding machine, the type 709, but
the main storage was four times as
large, 32,768 numbers in total, and
there was no magnetic drum. The
currently installed machine, the type
7090, is essentially a transistorized ver-
sion of the type 709. The main mag-
netic core storage has a capacity of
32,768 numbers and the access time is
approximately 2 microseconds. A
typical operation requires 2 access
times to complete or 24 usee for the
type 704 and 4 usee for the type 7090.
Converting these times to rates, ap-
proximate figures of 40,000 operations
per second and 250,000 operations per
second, respectively, are obtained.
In addition to the main magnetic
core storage, the machines have been
equipped with magnetic tape units to
add auxiliary capacity. Here again,
the units connected to the 7090 are
designed for a greater recording den-
sity than their predecessors; and
hence a greater capacity, as well as a
faster reading and writing rate, is
realized. The coated plastic tape is
one-half inch wide and seven local
magnets (or bits) may be recorded
across the width. Longitudinally, the
recording density is much greater; for
the type 704 tape units it was 200 bits
per inch and for the tape units in cur-
rent use it is 556 bits per inch. At
reading speed the tape moves 72
inches per second; and therefore, for
the higher bit density, a bit rate of
273,224 bits per second is obtainable.
In practice the transmission rate is
not this high since some time is re-
quired for acceleration and decelera-
tion, but rates of 30,000, 36-bit num-
bers per second are reasonable. The
following figures give some idea of
the physical and fiscal size of a large
scale machine of the type 7090 class.
The machine has approximately
15,500 circuit cards containing 75,000
transistors and 1500 diodes. The main
storage requires 1,179,648 ferromag-
netic toroids (magnetic cores) with
outside diameters of .019 inches.
These cores are wired together in
planes and each of these elementary
storage devices has at least three wires
threaded through it. Such a system
would cost a commercial purchaser
$2,500,000.00 (2.5 megabucks) or, if
rented, the monthly figure would be
about $70,000.
Cascaded Computers
The rates of transmission of num-
bers between the magnetic core stor-
age and magnetic tapes are impres-
sive, but compared to the arithmetic
operation rates they are still slow.
This disparity caused the primary in-
novation in the types 709 and 7090
computers. Both of these machines
are able to transmit numbers to or
from magnetic-core storage at the
same time that a sequence of arith-
metic operations are being executed.
This simultaneity means that the
computer is not delayed by the rela-
tively slow input and output opera-
tions. The overlap in operation is
made possible by connecting the
auxiliary storage devices to the main
storage through a buffer device,
called a "channel", which is capable
of executing a limited set of storage
operations independent of the arith-
metic processing. These input and
output operations are initiated by the
main instruction processor by simply
transmitting a set of these more ele-
mentary storage instructions to a
channel. In a sense these channels are
also computers, but they are subsidi-
ary to the main machine.
In spite of these elaborate devices
to insure the full utilization of the
high instruction-processing rate of the
machine, it is still not practical to
connect directly to the computer
electromechanical devices such as
printers, card punches, and card
readers. A much smaller and slower
computer, the IBM 1401, is installed
in the Center to prepare magnetic in-
put tapes lor the high speed machine
and to print or punch the contents of
magnetic tapes that were written dur-
ing the computation of problems by
the type 7090. Such machines are
called "peripheral computers", and
from two to three machines of this
type are needed to support a type
7090 computer running at lull capa-
city. The type 1401 can read punched
cards at the rate of 800 cards per
minute and print 600 lines of as many
as 132 characters per minute. With-
out such input-output specialists the
large numbers of computer users in
the University could not be accomo-
dated.
Some Instructional Statistics
When the type 704 computer was
first installed, an introductory course
was offered which used the
FORTRAN language as a vehicle for
expressing programs. The experience
with the assigned problems bore out
the previous conclusion that a state-
ment language was readily learned
and that if permitted the considera-
tion of much more complicated pro-
cedures than teaching machine in-
structions would allow. However, it
was also apparent that a translation
would be required on virtually every
trial of a student problem, and the
percentage of machine time devoted
to translation with only eighty stu-
dents involved was a hefty 30%. This
fraction, along with certain ideas for
the improvement of a statement lan-
guage, was the primary motivation for
writing the MAD translating pro-
gram, (Michigan Algorithm Decoder).
This translator was used for the first
time in the spring of 1960 and has
been the principal programming lan-
guage in use at the University since
that time.
The Ford Foundation Project on
the Use of Computers in Engineering
Education has done a great deal to
stimulate the active use of the com-
puter in connection with instruction.
As part of their evaluation of the
computing activity, the project per-
sonnel have obtained usage statistics
for the last semester that the type 709
computer was installed (Spring 1962).
In that semester a total of 26,051 com-
puting runs were submitted where
one run may be composed of several
parts to be translated as well as the
execution of the combined machine
instruction programs. Of this number,
20,124 were executed, i.e., execution
was requested and there were no
structural errors in the statements.
These programs, of course, did not
necessarily produce the right answers,
but they were "correct enough" so
that a trial could be made. Of that
total, 17,116 required the translation
of MAD statements to machine in-
structions. Problems assigned as part
of course work accounted for 13,016
runs.

pitting time is interesting in the light
of the preceding figures since they
seem to indicate an almost dispropor-
tionate emphasis on instructional
activity. There were 68,862 minutes
of productive computing time of
which 52,709 minutes were spent in
the actual execution of programs and
9,676 minutes spent in MAD transla-
tion. Classroom activity accounted for
13,511 of these minutes.
In brief summary, 50% of the prob-
lems submitted were the result of
classroom activity in the 79 courses
whose students made some approved
use of the computer. However, only
20% of the computing time was used
in this activity. Although MAD trans-
lation was required for 65% of the
runs, the time used in this way was
14% of the total. This large-scale par-
ticipation in the preparation of com-
puting problems was only possible
because most of the complex, ma-
chine-oriented aspects of program-
ming are delegated to translators and
utility programs.
Subroutines Behind the Scenes
A program written by an average
user has been likened to the visible
part of an iceberg; there is a lot more
that doesn't show. Of these unseen
routines that the user often unknow-
ingly causes to be executed, the
"monitor" is the principal one. This
controlling program analyzes the sub-
mitted program, selects the proper
translating routines for the various
segments of the program, coordinates
the linking of the resulting machine
language sections, monitors the
amount of time and output that the
submitted program uses, and invokes
certain utility routines in case a pro-
gram is not successfully completed. By
far the most complicated routines
which effectively become a part of the
user's program are those which con-
trol the introduction of data from
magnetic tape during the execution
of the submitted program and the dis-
patching of results to be printed to a
magnetic tape. The complexity of
these input-output routines is due to
three causes: (1) Generality. An al-
most unlimited number of incoming
data arrangements and outgoing
printing or punching arrangements
can be described by coded format
specifications which these input-out-
put routines interpret. In the simpli-
fied options variable names as well as
values are transmitted by these rou-
tines. (2) Conversion. In binary ma-
chines the incoming and outgoing
decimal values must be arithmetically
converted to or from the binary form.
Quantities which are to be treated by
the program as strings of characters
must be identified and a different
transmission process used. (3) Simul-
taneity. The fact that input and out-
put operations using magnetic tape
can proceed at the same time that
computing is in process, offers a con-
siderable increase in efficiency, but
also an increase in complexity. A
supeniisor program must check that
no attempt is made to use in compu-
tation information that has not yet
been completely entered into the
main storage. Conversely, a check is
required to guarantee that computing
does not destroy output information
that has not been dispatched to tape.
The subsidiary channels have the
ability to interrupt, or trap, the se-
quence of computational steps for a
variety of reasons. Such things as an
error on a tape being read or the end
of a reading or writing operation
cause a trap of the submitted pro-
gram to occur. A subroutine called
the trap processor is necessary to keep
track of these unpredictable interrup-
tions and to be able to continue the
computation from the point of inter-
ruption without error. Another sub-
routine, called the input-output
supeniisor, keeps an account of the re-
quested channel operations and de-
lays the computation when the input-
output operations cannot keep up.
Usually, this routine is "one-up" in
that the next set of information has
already been stored before it is re-
quired. This anticipation may mean
that at the end of a data set part of
the next program is already stored,
and precautions must be taken by
other routines to guarantee that this
waiting program is not destroyed by
the current one. Such guarantees of
protection are possible because the
type 7090 computer has the ability to
designate a section of magnetic core
storage as "protected". Attempts to
store numbers in the protected area
cause the offending program to be
trapped. This protected area is called
"low core" and contains, in addition
to the next information to be read,
parts of the monitor and the input-
output control subroutines, and one
location which is essentially a clock.
The number in the clock location is
incremented by unity every sixtieth of
a second. This clock is used as an
alarm clock to terminate programs
that exceed the programmer's esti-
mate of execution time, and it may be
used by the submitted program to
time certain parts of the execution.
Subroutines such as the ones brief-
ly described here are rapidly becom-
ing as vital in the operating of a
large-scale digital computer as the cir-
cuitry itself. In fact, in computing
jargon the physical machine is called
the hardu'are, and the supporting
translators and subroutines are re-
ferred to as the softu&gt;are. These wares
combined give even the casual user an
impressive ability to attempt the solu-
tion of very sophisticated problems.
Esoterics for Everyman
In the computing middle ages, a
decade ago, programming was indeed
a black art practiced only by small
groups who conversed with the "giant
brain" in hexadecimal notation. To-
day the brain designation is happily
disappearing, and in a given semes-
ter, about 1500 students and staff
members of the University directly
prepare programs for the type 7090
computer. This programmer popu-
lation explosion has been regarded as
disturbing in some quarters, and it is
certainly true that the ability to use
the equipment does not guarantee
that it will be used wisely or well.
Consider the case of the student
whose problem essentially was one of
finding the intersection between two
straight lines. He solved this problem
by evaluating the two linear functions
at thousands of points in the interval
of interest and taking as the abscissa
of the intersection point the value for
which the two functions were equal.
Needless to say, such trial and error
methods are not necessary to solve
this elementary problem. Certainly
the potential for abuse is great, but
then so is the potential for accom-
plishment. Most of the programs that
are run are conventional in the sense
that they are an automatization of the
classical approach to solving the
problem. Function evaluation, solv-
ing equations, and parameter studies
are examples of this type of problem-
Listed below are some examples of

which have been abstracted from
actual University projects and which
illustrate the diverse uses of digital
machines.
1. Concordance Production. The
contents of a book (or books)
are punched on cards and a pro-
gram written which produces a
list of all the significant words
(e.g. not articles), the page and
line reference of the use, and the
context in which it was used.
2. Pattern Recognition. A pattern
is digitized and is then examined
by a program which has built
into it the criteria for the recog-
nition of specific patterns. For
example, interesting particles
make a characteristic pattern in
a bubble chamber photograph.
Alphabetic characters need to be
distinguished if optical reading
divices are to be perfected.
3. Phoneme Translation. When a
string of phonemes (sounds) are
encoded, the program translates
this input to the equivalent
printed words.
4. Information Retrieval. Patho-
logical case histories are searched
for specific characteristics so that
the complete histories of these
selected cases may be studied.
5. Simulation. Queuring situations,
in which there is some unpre-
dictable element in the demand
on facilities, are simulated on
the computer. By examing such
simulations a most economical
allocation of such facilities can
be determined.
6. Business Games. Certain com-
petitive industries arc repre-
sented by a mathematical model
and earns of people can test
their hypotheses on financial
decisions by making such deci-
sions and then "evaluating" the
model. The challenge in pro-
grams of this type is, of course,
to make the model conform to
reality.
7. Monte-Carlo Calculations. It is
possible to represent the random
motion and collision path of a
neutron in a reactor. By follow-
ing the "random walk" of a
large number of neutrons and
counting those that pass the phy-
sical boundaries as well as those
that "die" before they reach the
boundaries, the effectiveness of
shielding can be evaluated.
8. Neural Networks. One hypoth-
esis is that brains are initially a
randomly connected group of
neurons which, due to chance
and stimuli, become organized
to respond to certain, predictable
ways. Such networks are simulat-
ed and their "learning" ability
tested under various connection
and stimuli hypotheses.
The solution of partial differential
equations is a problem of great im-
portance and sufficiently taxing to
warrant special mention. Whenever
the statement is advanced that com-
puters will become so large and fast
that problems complex enough to
justify them do not exist, the partial
differential equation problem pro-
vides an instant rebuttal. These equa-
tions, which are the fundamental
descriptions of so many physical phe-
nomena, have indeed justified the
building of special digital machines
to solve them. The numerical solu-
tion is, in a sense, a simulation. The
estimated values of the desired func-
tion are tabulated at thousands of
points in the region of solution. The
problem then is to adjust these values
in such a way that the differential
relations are simultaneously satisfied
at all of the points and boundaries. As
the number of dimensions increases,
this set of points increases factorially
and hundreds of trials may be re-
quired to satisfy the conditions simul-
taneously (if ever). Since a rather
elaborate computation is usually re-
quired at each of the points, this
grossly over-simplified description may
give some idea why the problem is
so time consuming. Nonetheless, it is
perhaps the most important single
problem in the area of scientific com-
putation and much needs to be done,
both theoretically and in the realm
of computing techniques, before its
solution can be called routine. Simul-
taneous computation as well as simul-
taneous input-output operations
would be useful for such problems.
Future Wares
It is interesting to speculate on the
possible avenues of growth and devel-
opment of the University's comput-
ing facilities. The type 7090 is basic-
ally a machine that was designed in
the early part of the last decade. The
first large scale electronic machine
produced by IBM, the type 701, had
essentially the same organization,
without, of course, any provision for
simultaneous input-output operation.
There is a variation, the type 7094,
which offers a speed improvement of
approximately 1.8 with essentially the
some organization, but the line seems
likely to end with this variation.
Judging from trends and the efforts of
several manufacturers, the next gen-
eration of hardware will have larger
number size (64 to 72 bits), two in-
structions per storage location, the
ability to operate arithmetically on
parts of numbers, and the ability to
do decimal arithmetic as well as
binary. These machines will probably
have multiple arithmetic registers and
large magnetic memories (65,000
numbers and up) with access times
of approximately one microsecond.
The program interrupt or trapping
capabilities will be extended to de-
vices outside of the computer proper.
One aspect of the software to come
is indicated by the improved trapping
abilities of the hardware. Supervisory
routines similar in function, but vast-
ly more complicated, to the current
input-output supervisor could moni-
tor the operation of a number of
people working from individual con-
soles who could then be running and
checking their programs directly—
effectively, time-sharing the large ma-
chine.
The far distant future (a decade
or more) may again see machines
with two different types of main
storage. One section would have the
capacity for a thousand numbers with
access times of 10 nanoseconds (0.01
microseconds), and a large slow
storage with a capacity of 16 million
numbers and an access time of 5
usee would provide the second type.
It will be a very challenging task to
arrange for such a prodigious pro-
cessor to be effectively used by the
University community, and there is
little respite in the fact that such a
device is a computer generation away.
If history is any indication, the pace
of technological advance will be such
that computing machines will con-
tinue to "live fast, die young, and
leave a good-looking corpse."

LYCRA*
A production triumph for technical men
Few women enjoying their 4-ounce LYCRA and nylon
bathing suits will care how LYCRA spandex fiber got to be
a third lighter than rubber and three times as restraining.
But the technical men who produce LYCRA at our
Waynesboro, Va., plant do care. For LYCRA is tough to
make. As one technical man put it, "LYCRA requires the
greatest care, the finest controls, the most complex chemi-
cal reactions and manufacturing processes, the most deli-
cate handling. The fact that it js being made-and of the
highest quality—is a stunning achievement."
Considering that LYCRA is just one of hundreds of such
products developed and manufactured by Du Pont, there's
little reason to wonder why we need so many good chemi-
cal, mechanical, industrial and electrical engineers, physi-
cists, mathematicians and chemists.
And on the production line, their responsibilities are
big. Especially for some of them-like the new supervisors
in our photo-who were in college like yourself just a few
years ago. For not only must they excel in their respective
technical specialties-they must also have leadership
abilities and strong feelings for sound employee relations.

moving an appendix, so it is unrea-
sonable to find a professor of ma-
chine tool design who has never de-
signed a machine tool""'.
The Place of Design in Modern
Engineering
Design is the essence of engineer-
ing, as previously pointed out, so let
us consider this function which dif-
ferentiates engineering from all
other endeavor.
The confusion of design with one
of the languages of engineering-
drawing—is to be regretted. Use may
be made of logic, mathematical com-
putations, experimental tests, sym-
bolic diagrams, or various other tech-
niques to help synthesize, compro-
mise, and integrate the components
into a functioning whole and within
specified limitations. These are all
forms of engineering design. To be
effective they usually require a sig-
nificant measure of application
knowledge which must come from
practical experience.
"Graduates of engineering colleges
are not immediately engineers upon
graduation—they are potential engi-
neers only. They have not yet prac-
ticed engineering and are not engi-
neers"".
Teaching of specific knowledge,
skills, and techniques is generally un-
desirable. Due to the rapid advance-
ment of the physical sciences, such
training becomes rapidly obsolete
and outdated. Therefore engineering
design should be taught as "an engi-
neering approach" based upon funda-
mentals of science. Secondly, to this
should be the acquisition of knowl-
edge and skills related to an engineer-
ing field.
"An engineer becomes a profes-
sional not through vast knowledge of
science and mathematics but through
knowledge pertinent to the field of
his practice, judgment based on dis-
cerning experience, creative ability
and willingness to accept responsibil-
ity for decisions on the use of men,
money, and materials to achieve his
ends"1.
"Engineering design is the contin-
ual search for a better way—not just a
way—preferably an optimum way of
accomplishing a given job. Engineers
try to maximize some desirable attri-
bute or minimize some undesirable
attribute or a combination of these.
Thus, the engineer is continually
seeking more economical, quicker,
more reliable way of building devices
and organizing operations as he car-
ries out his design and engineering
function".7
Professor Chena, in the very signifi-
cant article cited, gives an excellent
explanation of how "the engineering
approach"—engineering design—can
be applied using the up-to-date
mathematical and scientific knowl-
edge and techniques in such a way
that it will not be merely currently
temporal. He shows how the engi-
neering approach based upon the
modern concepts in the engineering
sciences can be applied which will be
effective no matter what are the cur-
rent specific practices in any field!
Specific application courses are
only needed to a very limited degree
when design is approached in this
manner. However, we still must teach
some "know-how."
"Thrjre are those who claim that
anything smacking at practical work
should be eliminated. Practical work
in dismissed glibly by saying this can
be picked up later on. Certainly it
can be and must be; but I think we
have to teach some of this, or we are
not orienting our students to the lull
scope of engineering practice. What
we pick up later from industry may
be woefully incomplete"".
"Young engineers tend to consider
problems which do not involve
mathematics at least at the level of
calculus as beneath their dignity. . . .
inspite of the clear indication that
the most important decisions in a de-
sign problem must often be made
without assistance of higher mathe-
matics. ... In a design problem syn-
thesis must come first. . . . Analysis
does not answer all or even a majority
of the questions the engineer must
answer in a typical design problem.
It seems unlikely that numerical anal-
ysis will ever answer more than a
small proportion of these questions.
The remainder of the questions must
be decided on the basis of . . . experi-
ment, experience, logical reasoning
and personal preference"8.
The Relationship between Advanced
Training and Experience
It has been previously stated that
educators have misapplied the educa-
tional standard of advanced degrees
to a field for which it is not suitable.
There is an explanation why edu-
cators seek to apply a false education-
al standard to engineering. In most
fields of education and the pure sci-
ences, there is no recognizable meas-
ure of performance or experience.
How can you judge someone's "expe-
rience" in literature, history, biology,
mathematics, chemistry, and the like?
Therefore, in lieu of any other meas-
ure, advanced degrees have been pre-
sumed as an indication of the knowl-
edge or professional development in
these fields. Educational aciniinistra-
tors make the grave mistake of ex-
tending this same concept to fields
where experience is obtainable. This
is a serious error because it has re-
sulted in a marked preference for
advanced degrees over experience
when actually the reverse should be
the case for engineering.
This false educational standard has
been well recognized by a number of
persons who left the engineering
teaching profession9.
Those with doctoral degrees in en-
gineering often are persons who have
spent their time learning rather than
practicing engineering, or who are
not in engineering, but rather in sci-
ence and research. They are therefore,
not really engineers. Some may have
done "consulting", but this is not the
equivalent of practical experience,
though it is certainly better than no
experience. Such individuals com-
monly are engineering teachers.
Therefore, they have helped transfer
the false educational standard to en-
gineering education. Naturally it
builds up their status and even pro-
tects them from the threat of those
who are possibly superior engineers
as a result of practice and experience,
but who, because of the time spent in
gaining experience, do not have ad-
vanced degrees.
Indeed, the practical application of
knowledge is frequently more difficult
than the presenting of theory. Often
the presenting of theory can be done
by merely reading some textbook on
the subject and regurgitating the con-
tents back to the students as a lecture
or "seminar".
"The problems of highly deductive
science which lend themselves to
mathematical analysis are much sim-
pler really than are the problems in
other areas of engineering such as in-

neering lor example. Far from being
backward as some would have us be-
lieve, these areas involve complex de-
cisions which have heavy human im-
pact; for example, organized unions,
management hierarchies, seniority,
guaranteed wage, labor legislation,
sociological impact of automation,
morale, etc. to cite but a few prob-
lems in industrial engineering or the
condemnation of citi/en homes, the
location or relocation of thorofares in
a politically chargetl environment,
public reactions to location of sewage
treatment plants with resultant prop-
erty deterioration, legal codes which
may have been outmoded. ... It
would be so nice to have a Maxwell's
ecmation, a Bernoulli's theorem, or a
Brandtl's theory to apply, but where
human beings are involved, a solu-
tion arrived at in aggregate or statis-
tical mechanics sense fails miserably
when applied since individual highly
vocal units are involved. . . . Engi-
neering must be intimately concerned
with all this. . . . the patient scientist
in his laboratory seeking a research
results is spared these considera-
tions"8.
"Since the problems of finding an
ideal engineering teacher is so diffi-
cult, why not dismiss that problem by
pretending that the real problem is
to give the students more and more
'fundamentals' of science and mathe-
matics? If this outlook is declared
loudly and repeated often enough
one comes to accept this as both a
mark of progress and an inevitable
trend."
"It is easier, therefore, to redefine
our educational needs so that they
can be met by getting bright young
men on the faculty who are scientifi-
cally oriented and have never prac-
ticed. They may serve as consultants,
it is true. Consultation, however, is
no substitute for shouldering respon-
sibility for engineering decisions
which are based on many unknowns
and require the judicious application
of calculated risks and factors of
safety"6.
The author has visited many indus-
trial plants, talked with many indus-
trial executives in the United States,
Europe, Japan, and Brazil and the
great preponderance of these execu-
tives confinn that, in their opinion,
engineering educators are in error to
be pushing science and advanced de-
grees when it is engineering and suita-
ble practical experience which should
be developed, encouraged, and util-
ized.
There is one exception, that is, the
research directors of large corpora-
tions who want engineering scientists
and thus are not really interested in
engineers as such. It is very regretable,
but a few hundred of these research
directors with their vast financial re-
sources, their research grants, and the
prestige that accompanies their large
size organizations, seem to dominate
the industrial contacts of engineering
educators. However, tens of thousands
of smaller companies use and want
engineers, rather than scientists. The
needs of this vast group tend to be
largely ignored by engineering educa-
tional administrators even though,
collectively, these represent the major
users of engineers.
"It seems trite, but perhaps neces-
sary to say that embryo engineers
should be taught by engineers. The
policy of recruiting our faculty pri-
marily from newly made Ph.D.'s and
Sc.D.'s leads to teaching analytical
techniques to embryo analytical tech-
nicians".
"The first problem (hiring experi-
enced engineers) obviously involves
the differential between teaching
salaries and industrial salaries, a dif-
ferential which in the case of engi-
neers can be largely off-set by con-
sulting".
"The problem of encouraging stalf
members to acquire engineering ex-
perience is perhaps not as difficult.
Many of our younger faculty mem-
bers have taken leaves of absence to
spend a year in an industrial atmos-
phere. If the job is well selected, a
year in industry can be a valuable
experience. Particular pains should be
taken to insure that the faculty mem-
ber is used as an engineer and not as
a computing device. Your committee
rejects the argument that if the
people leave teaching they are likely
to stay in industry at high salaries.
. . . Valuable engineering experience
is also available to staff members who
have the opportunity of working in
. . . peripheral laboratories where
complete engineering problems are
attacked"."
This leads us to the consideration
of the place of research in engineer-
ing education.
The Position of Research in Engineering
Education
"History has shown that institu-
tions of higher learning have always
been centers of research. ... As long
as we accept the research function as
vital to the business of a university,
and I know of no serious thinker who
believes otherwise, we have achieved
the first step in our discussion".
"Contract research' looks attractix&gt;e
from many points of view. Govern-
ment and industry need the technical-
scientific help that professors are
qualified to supply. Large funds are
available to solve difficult problems".
"Additions to staff need to be made
to carry the new contract obligations,
which bring new blood to the univer-
sity. In some schools where the nor-
mal academic week is traditionally
considered as 4 days plus a fifth spent
on personal activities including indus-
trial consulting, a contract researcher
may receive a 25% increase in base
salary spending the fifth day on con-
tract work".
"Contracts also provide a means for
stimulating faculty members whose
thinking has not kept up with prog-
ress in their fields. By accepting con-
venient employment under condi-
tions financially attractive to them,
they are often brought face-to-face
with current problems."
"Research equipment, is obtained
through contracts. Sometimes the
school receives full title at the end of
the contract period to equipment pur-
chased with contract funds. Some-
times the sponsors retain title but
permit the school to use the equip-
ment. ... In some instances the
schools obtain title to the equipment
at a very modest cost"10.
Basic research, on the other hand
has been overemphasized in some
schools. "Applied scientists appeared
on the staff of engineering colleges,
infusing healthful cross fertilization.
Unfortunately, but naturally, in
many instances they brought narrow
viewpoints concentrated almost en-
tirely on the basic research portion of
the engineering spectrum, with little
understanding or interest in engineer-
ing as a profession".
"The situation in engineering to-
day is not unlike that which would
exist in medicine if research medical
doctors suddenly began to feel that
research was the only important as-
pect of their profession, and if the
practicing medical physician w'as sud-
denly downgraded to a second class
citizen"".

search activity would be akin to oper-
ating an educational institution with-
out a library. . . . The eventual
success of an engineering college re-
search program depends upon the at-
titudes and capabilities of the faculty
who supervise and conduct the vari-
ous projects".
"Some types of sponsored contracts
provide a percentage of the total con-
tract funds for 'exploration' research.
. . . Many projects can be appropriate-
ly maintained at relatively low dollar
levels and still serve their functions in
supporting the graduate program,
satisfying the intellectual needs of the
faculty member, and maintaining the
reputation and leadership of the in-
stitution"12.
In Conclusion
The emerging trend of engineering
in the U.S. is finally the recognitioti
of the fact that engineering is a dis-
tinct field of its own and not merely
"applied science" nor research. An
integral part of this recognition is
the realization that design—the syn-
thesizing and compromising to create
a functioning whole within definite
limitations—is the real essence of engi-
neering and distinguishes it from all
other fields—including science.
Therefore, to effectively train engi-
neers requires the realization by
educators that engineering is the
combining of knowledge (acquired
through training) and experience (ac-
quired through actual practice). This
means that engineering teachers need
to have practical experience for which
no amount of training is a substitute.
It is generally agreed that practical
research is a vital requirement for
schools of engineering to help train
students more realistically, to help
keep the faculty in touch with prac-
tical aspects that constitute engineer-
ing, to more effectively conduct grad-
uate work, and to help develop poten-
tial faculty.

MATHEMATICAL METHODS
(Continued from page 21)
problems have been studied for sev-
eral years, and it has been found that
most problems of physics can be
phrased in variational form: nature
always tries to choose the path which
is most efficient, in an appropriate
sense.
Recent work in optimization in
control systems has leaned heavily on
the calculus of variations. Very chal-
lenging questions of this type are
presented by satellites; considerations
of weight and costs make it impera-
tive that the paths followed after
launching be as close to the extremal
paths (which achieve the optimum)
as possible.
The point of view of the calculus
of variations has also been exploited
in numerically solving boundary val-
ue problems, arising in fluid mechan-
ics, elasticity and other fields. The
method of Rayleigh-Ritz-Galerkin is a
systematic way of obtaining an ap-
proximate solution by minimizing
energy or some analogous quantity.
A difference equation relates the
values of a function at discrete, equal-
ly spaced values of the independent
variable. For example, x (t + 2) — 2x
(t + 1) - 3x(t) = 0 is a difference
equation for x (t). Most commonly,
this equation would be considered
only for t = 0, ± 1, . . . Thus one is
really concerned with a sequence
xn = x (n) and the equation could be
written
xn+2 - 2 xn+( - 3xn=0
Many systems designed to-day are
composed of a large number of dis-
crete stages, and the corresponding
mathematical equations take the form
of difference equations. The theory
of solution of such equations parallels
that of differential equations: the
simpler ones are easily solved, the
complicated ones (especially those
which are nonlinear) present great
difficulties.
Conclusion
We have surveyed many branches
of mathematics and have seen how
both the subject and its applications
are rapidly growing, penetrating ever
more deeply into all of science and in
particular to practical engineering
questions. The engineer may well ask
whether the impossible is to be de-
manded of him: to master far more
mathematics than before and to be
able to apply it to the new problems
as they arise. The only apparent way
out of the dilemma is for mathema-
ticians as teachers to become more
efficient in presenting their knowl-
edge, so that with little or no increase
in the time expended an engineer can
learn all he needs. It is most import-
ant that the mathematics instruction
be such that an engineer is able to use
books and other published material
to supplement his knowledge-he
must know where to look for informa-
tion and know enough mathematics
to be able to read intelligently. The
mathematician can cooperate again
by writing expository books and
articles in simplest possible language,
to make the more advanced material
accessible to those with limited back-
ground.

He was a great scientist in his day
This Sumerian was minding our busi-
ness five thousand years ago.
Like Olin, he specialized in chemi-
cals and metals. He smelted copperand
tin to make bronze. He made an iron
axle, put it between two wheels, and off
he went.
Men have always been trying to find
the answers to important problems. To-
day, Olin is at it, harder than ever.
Our pioneering research in liquid
chlorine helped eradicate typhoid and
other water-borne diseases.
Our anti-tubercular drug, nydrazid?
is a major reason TB deaths de-
creased 60% in the last eight years.
Olin's ammonium phosphate fertiliz-
er (Ammo-Phos*) makes it possible for
farmers to grow more food than ever
before.
And to prevent the tremendous
waste in food spoilage, we're workingon
an antibiotic-coated plastic wrapping.

"An Equal Opportunity Employer"
To take a big sting out of life, Olin is
developing a high speed cartridge that
enables medicine to be injected without
the use of hypodermics.
But none of these advances could
have been made without our scientists.
Every division of Olin seeks the cre-
ative, scientific mind for the answers to
the research problems of our day. If this

taken by one of the students in engineering. The diagonal lines were formed during deformation of the
material. The fact that these deformation lines continued through the diagonal phase (i.e., crystals) rather than
around them helps the student to understand the strength possibilities of this material.
Materials Engineering
Materials Engineering is a new area of technical study. It is true that engineers have always been con-
cerned with the use of materials. However, the present demands of advanced engineering designs require new
and detailed attention to the production, properties and specifications of Engineering Materials. The numbers
of specialists who are required in this area by industrial and government engineering and research groups
exceed the numbers of trained people. Therefore several of the leading engineering schools are following
the University of Michigan's pattern for establishing curricula covering the broad area of Materials Engineering.
The materials of engineering include metals, plastics, and ceramics (inorganic compounds). The nature
of each of these receives attention in a Materials curriculum after initial courses in introductory chemistry and
physics. Finally, material selection must be considered for the exacting electrical, mechanical, thermal and
radiation requirements during service.

NORDEN
keep your career in motion


Norden's advanced programs give you
a genuine "ground floor" opportunity
to develop your talents, and to help
bring projects like these to successful
completion:
Molecular Circuitry
Norden has developed integrated
crystals which functionally replace
conventional circuits. The crystal
held in the tweezers performs the
same function as the larger and
earlier miniaturized components
shown here.
Inertia I Platform
Norden's inertial platform is the
heart of inertial navigation sys-
tems for missiles, space vehicles,
surface vessels, aircraft and sub-
marines. It measures only 8" x
10", weighs 20 pounds and main-
tains vehicle stability regardless
of heading, pitch or roll.
Contact Analog
Norden's contact analog display
provides key parameters for sub-
marines, aircraft and manned
space vehicles. This system utilizes
advanced television and computer
techniques developed by Norden.
Analog Digital Converters
Norden has engineered more than
60 types of analog digital con-
verters for military and industrial
use. Shown here is Norden's
MICROGON digital encoder which
can measure the angle subtended
by a ping pong ball at a distance
of six miles.
Our new multimillion-dollar facilities
make available the laboratories and
equipment you'll need.
Norden also offers excellent graduate
study programs. And living conditions
in Fairfield County are most enjoyable.
If you're an electrical engineer or
physicist, and will graduate in January
or June, contact your College Place-
ment Officer or write to Mr. James E.

At long last, the long last horse

|DE_ETLCP
iDaETEDP
The horseplayers of America have
made a contribution to engineering.
True horseplayers spend their lives
contributing. They contribute by a
process based on ordinal digits. Deter-
mination of the digits often requires
instrumentation. A sound technology
has developed to support this instru-
mentation. The horseplayers gladly
support the technology by their con-
tributions. The technology is now old
enough to have added the expression
"photo finish" to common speech.
A photo-finish negative is projected
for the judges less than 25 seconds
after the last horse crosses the finish
line. They nearly always wait for the
last horse. If the last horse is quite late,
it looks longer than the first horse
because there is hardly need for it to
hurry any more as it passes the finish
line. The finish line is the optical con-
jugate of a narrow slit at the focal
plane of the camera. The film moves
past the slit at constant speed.
We have just introduced a new
KODAK Timing Negative Film for
this work. We don't see why the new
film should be denied to off-track use.
It is a 35mm film with the perforations
omitted and the edge legend kodak
safety film reduced in height to .014",
all in order to make room for the tim-
ing signal and other indicia (some of
which have been deleted from the
above illustration to protect the privacy
of the jockeys). When developed for
10 seconds in the proper hot developer,
it yields extraordinary definition at an
Exposure Index of about 100. Fix-
ation is extremely rapid. Contrast is
readily controlled by the processing
parameters. Spectral sensitivity is
notably uniform from the ultraviolet
to 630m/t.
Electric
sugar, *S p«
A mighty industry breaks down the
sugar molecule in the interests of con-
viviality. Use of the sugar molecule as
a base for further building is little
practiced, except by us. (We do it in
the northeast corner of a state which
respects the venerable craft that works
the other way.)
And what is achieved thereby?
A high dielectric constant, a large
increase in the capacitance of an elec-
trical condenser compared with when
there is nothing between the plates.
Obviously, the manufacturers of
capacitors and of electroluminescent
panels have had to be notified. We
&gt;r lb.
find them interested and alert.
We divert a little sucrose from coffee
breaks and react it with acrylonitrile,
forming a clear, viscous liquid desig-
nated Cyanoethyl Sucrose in which a
statistical 7.3 of the 8 available hy-
droxyls are replaced by OC..H4CN
groups. At 60 cycles this substance has
a dielectric constant of 38 and com-
petes with other cyanoethylated di-
electrics at 11-19 and with chlorinated
aromatic hydrocarbons at 4-6. (The
dielectric constant of water runs
around 80, but water is such watery
stuff!)

Chemical advice
Virtually every laboratory in this
country and many other countries
that ever has occasion to work with
organic compounds has a green book
entitled Eastman Organic Chemicals List
No. 42. It gives the accepted nomen-
clature, structural formulas, melting
range or boiling range, and prices for
convenient quantities of thousands of
compounds, many of them in several
grades of purity. Perhaps you have a
copy.
Get rid of it.
It is out of date. The new one bears
the designation List No. 4.1, which seems
logical enough. It is BLUE. There is
a first-rate chance of acquiring a blue
one by asking a division of ours called
Distillation Products Industries,
Rochester 3, N Y. If this offer appeals
to you at all, we can visualize you in
a position some day to do us a favor
by buying our chemicals. It is with
that same eye to the future that we
try to keep you aware of photographic
ways of engineering.
Since past endeavors in these
directions have made the goods
move well, possibility arises also
of becoming one of us instead of
a customer. For example, suc-
cessful chemical plants need
good men to instrument them for
process control. Interested?

An Interview
with G.E.'s
H. B. Miller,
Vice President,
Manufacturing
Services

Halbert B. Miller has managerial
responsibility for General Electee's
Manufacturing Services. This re-
sponsibility includes performing serv-
ices work for the Company in the
areas of manufacturing engineering;
manufacturing operations and or-
ganization; quality control; person-
nel development; education, train-
ing and communications; materials
management; purchasing and sys-
tems as well as the Real Estate and
Construction Operation. Mr. Miller
holds a degree in mechanical engi-
neering and began his General
Electric career as a student engi-
neer on the Company's Test Course

Manufacturing Careers Offer
Diversity, Challenge
and Opportunity
Q. Mr. Miller, what do engineers do in manufacturing?
A. Engineers design, build, equip, and operate our General Electric plants through-
out the world. In General Electric, this is manufacturing work, and it sub-divides
into categories, such as quality control engineering, materials management, shop
management, manufacturing engineering, and plant engineering. All of these jobs
require technical men for many reasons. First, the complexity of our products is
on the increase. Today's devices—involving mechanical, electrical, hydraulic,
electronic, chemical, and even atomic components—call for a high degree of
technical knowhow. Then there's the progressive trend toward mechanization and
automation that demands engineering skills. And finally, the rapid development of
new tools and techniques has opened new doors of technical opportunity—elec-
tronic data processing, computers, numerically programmed machine tools, auto-
matic processing, feedback control, and a host of others. In short, the require-
ments of complex products of more exacting quality, of advanced processes and
techniques of manufacture, and of industry's need for higher productivity add up
to an opportunity and a challenge in which the role of engineers is vital.
Q. How do opportunities for technical graduates in manufacturing stack up
with other areas?
A. Manufacturing holds great promise for the creative technical man with leader-
ship ability. Over 60 percent of the 250,000 men and women in General Electric
are in manufacturing. You, as an engineer, will become part of the small technical
core that leads this large force, and your opportunity for growth, therefore, is
unexcelled. Technical graduates in manufacturing are teamed with those in mar-
keting who assess customer needs; those in research and development who con-
ceive new products; and those in engineering who create new product designs. I
sincerely believe that the role of technical graduates of high competence in the
manufacturing function is one of the major opportunities for progress in industry.
Q. What technical disciplines are best suited to a career in manufacturing?
A. We need men with Doctor's, Master's, and Bachelor's degrees in all the tech-
nical disciplines, including engineering, mathematics, chemistry and physics. We
need M.B.A.'s also. General Electric's broad diversification plus the demands of
modern manufacturing call for a wide range of first-class technical talent. For one
example: outside of the Federal Government, we're the largest user of computers
in the United States. Just think of the challenge to mathematicians and business-
systems men.
Q. My school work has emphasized fundamentals. Will General Electric train
me in the specifics I need to be effective?
A. Yes, the Manufacturing Training Program is designed to do just that. Seminars
which cover the sub-functions of manufacturing will expose you to both the theo-
retical and practical approaches to operating problems. Each of the succeeding
jobs you have will train you further in the important work areas of manufacturing.
Q. After the Program—what?
A. From that point, your ability and initiative will determine your direction.
Graduates of the Manufacturing Training Program have Company-wide oppor-
tunities and they continue to advance to positions of greater responsibility.

at American Oil
by J*m, Ke&amp;Ls
"When I was first interviewed by American Oil
representatives I was told I'd be given a free
hand in guiding a wide variety of projects. This
promise has certainly been kept!"
Jim Koller, 25 years old, came to American
Oil right out of the University of Wisconsin
where he earned his Bachelor of Science degree
in Chemical Engineering. An Evans Scholar at
Wisconsin, Jim describes his job at American Oil
this way: "I work on basic chemical engineering
problems, specializing in reactor design and
process development problems. Before a process
can go commercial, it must be tested in pilot
plants. That's where I come in." Jim wants to
stay in the technical research area, and plans
to enroll in the Illinois Institute of Technology
night school for courses in advanced mathematics.
The fact that many gifted and earnest young
men like Jim Koller are finding challenging careers
at American Oil could have special meaning for
you. American Oil offers a wide range of new
research opportunities for: Chemists—analytical,
electrochemical, inorganic, physical, polymer,
organic, and agricultural; Engineers—chemical,
mechanical, metallurgical, and plastics; Masters
in Business Administration with an engineering
(preferably chemical) or science background;
Mathematicians; Physicists.

This forging forms the critical stress-bearing
segment of the turnpost on which a rugged hy-
draulic loader rotates. It must withstand the sud-
den high-magnitude stresses transmitted by the
17-foot boom, even in the bitter cold of northern
winter logging operations. It replaced a less de-
pendable part that had caused costly breakdowns
in the field. By converting to forgings, the manu-
facturer ended turnpost failures.
Why did the designer look to forgings for
superior strength and reliability? Because forged
parts start with refined metals, uniform through-
out. By hot-working this superior stock between
precision dies in forging hammers or presses, the
structure of the metal is improved even further.
That's why forgings offer unique opportunities to
improve strength-weight ratios and reduce pro-
duction costs.
Forged parts withstand the landing impact of
jet aircraft, yet are light and strong. They help
restrain the tremendous temperatures and pres-
sures involved in modern missile technology; im-
prove the performance of vital automotive parts.
Forgings enhance the safety factor of our high-
speed world.
Research projects sponsored by the forging in-
dustry and its suppliers will increase even further
the ability of forgings to endure the extremes of
temperature and the greater stresses inherent in
the engineering challenges of tomorrow.
Be better informed about the advantages of
forged parts. Write for documented case studies
of forged parts converted, at a saving, from less
satisfactory higher cost processes. Address: Drop

Action: Now under Army test, a Ford-designed glass filament torsion
bar that's lighter, stronger, more flexible than steel
"Looks like you've got something there," the Army Tank
Command said in effect to Ford Motor Company engineers.
"Let's do a feasibility study on tracklaying military vehicles."
The story begins in 1957 when Ford engineers conceived
the idea of a plastic-bonded glass filament torsion bar for
vehicle suspension systems. It was a revolutionary departure
from the use of solid steel. It promised dramatic weight
savings in battle tanks, in personnel carriers and other
military vehicles. For example, as much as 1,000 pounds
in medium tanks.
Compared to steel, the tubular-shaped glass filament com-
position has greater energy storage potential—is stronger
and more flexible under heavy load. It may well prove to be
the automobile suspension material of tomorrow . . . cars
suspended on glass!

The NASA-McDonnell Project Gemini is the major link
between Project Mercury and Project Apollo (this
nation's first flight to the moon). It will give our space
effort vital information on prolonged spaceflight effects
and will also be used to test space rendezvous techniques.
Gemini's advanced environmental system will keep the
spacecraft's two astronauts comfortable for two weeks of
continuous orbital flight. Garrett-AiResearch builds the
system that provides a breathable atmosphere, pressuri-
zation, temperature control, ventilation and atmosphere
purification in the two-man spacecraft and in both
astronauts' suits for the entire flight. AiResearch also
supplies the supercritical cryogenic oxygen and hydrogen
tankage system for the spacecraft's fuel cell power supply.
This is but one more example of Garrett's proved capa-
bility in the design and production of vital systems and
their components for spacecraft, missile, aircraft, elec-
tronic, nuclear and industrial applications.

THE SPACE AGE PROBLEM
Historians like to refer to the various periods in man's
evolution with names which denote some particular aspect of
each period. For instance, as man evolved, he passed through
periods such as the Stone Age, the Iron Age, the Bronze Age,
and the Dark Ages; presently he is considered to be in the
Space Age. That is, the quest for knowledge about and the
exploration of space characterizes this age.
Before man could enter the Space Age, he needed an
increased understanding of the universe and he needed the
technological advances accompanying this understanding to
assist his intellectual probing of space. Now that this founda-
tion has been laid, the need for understanding and technology
is greater than ever, and the national need for engineers who
are well educated in the newest advances of science as well
as the traditional engineering fundamentals is growing rapid-
ly. Consequently more emphasis is being placed on mathe-
matics and engineering theory by educators and better engi-
neers are being produced by our nation's institutions of
higher learning.
Complicating this problem of offering a better technical
education to meet the country's needs is the problem that the
number of engineers graduating from colleges each year is de-
creasing. The nation's appetite for competent personnel to fill
the engineering ranks is not being satisfied and a void is
developing which may seriously affect this country's ability to
make technological advances at a rate commensurate with the
growth of the rest of the world. If such a situation does result,
our prestige as a world power and our national economy will
suffer the consequences.
Evidently this problem of decreasing graduate engineers
deserves serious consideration so that some corrections may
be made before the situation becomes any worse. However, an
analysis of the problem points up some observable trends
which should encourage more young men to pursue engineer-
ing as a career, but nevertheless this same decreasing tendency
still persists. One such trend, which is consistent with the
economic law of supply and demand, is the rising salary rate
for graduate engineers. The increased demand for engineers
by industry and the decreased supply of engineers available
to industry has caused the salary scale to rise gently over the
past five years. However, at this point economic principles
fail to explain why more students are not attracted into engi-
neering, and, in fact, why the number is actually diminishing.
Perhaps some sociological explorations would be more
enlightening. As a profession, engineering has long been re-

garded as stable and associated with a moderate amount of
prestige, although slightly less than that enjoyed by other
professional men, such as doctors, lawyers, and dentists. When
compared with the other professional careers on a pecuniary
basis, it is noted that engineers, as a group, earn somewhat
less than their professional brothers. Therefore, engineers
are considered to be hard working individuals, enjoying
moderate prestige, but not especially prosperous monetarily.
This combination of hard work, and corresponding salary
level may very well be one feature of the engineering pro-
fession which serves to deter new entrants.
No solution to the existing problem has yet been pro-
posed, for on the basis of the above considerations, no solu-
tion is feasible. Perhaps it is merely necessary for young men
to become more aware that the life of a modern engineer is
increasingly rewarding in non-monetary aspects and that the
role of engineering as a force in shaping destiny is also
becoming more important. And perhaps then will this prob-
lem be solved, but until then, colleges and the government
must expend their maximum effort in order to meet the
challenge of the future.

going our way?
It's a direction you should definitely consider when charting
the course of your career.
As the pioneer and leading manufacturer of VTOL (vertical
take-off and landing) aircraft, we know that many young
engineers have found "going our way" to be a challenging and
exciting route to career goals.
Here, at Sikorsky Aircraft, alert, well-trained engineering minds
will enjoy the individual recognition and personal growth
opportunities which go hand in hand with the startling advances
of a new technology. The modern Sikorsky vehicle is a VTOL
system which embodies the merging of sophisticated electronic
systems with the VTOL airframe ... to create the world's most
versatile means of transportation.
And the reach of the exciting future ahead for VTOL systems
can at best only be suggested by such current usages as: space
capsule recovery • anti-submarine systems • equipment and
personnel transport • airport passenger travel • industrial
transport and personal transportation.
Supporting these activities is an excellent engineering environ-
ment . . . providing for free and active interchange of ideas
between small, compact, interdependent groups. Assignments
are diversified and stimulating—with electronic teams or groups
working on demanding problems in such areas as aerodynam-
ics • human factor* engineering • automatic control!
• stress engineering • weight prediction • systems anal-
ysis • operations research • reliability/maintainabil-
ity engineering • autonavlgatlon systems... among others.
GRADUATE STUDY OPPORTUNITIES: In addition to
an attractive professional environment, Sikorsky Aircraft offers
engineers the opportunity to earn advanced degrees through a
corporation-financed Graduate Education Program. These pro-
grams are available at such accredited schools as Yale Univer-
sity, New York University, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute
(Hartford Graduate Center), and Columbia University.

CHEEKING STOCK ELIMINATED
STOCK WITH MALLEABLE
Eliminate Draft Allowance Metal
In designing surfaces perpendicular to a parting line,
minimum draft angle requirements can be important to
finished cost. By changing these automotive crankshafts
to high strength pearlitic Malleable iron castings, the draft
angle on sides of counterweights was reduced to one-half
of one degree. This eliminated all excess stock formerly
required in forming . . . and the machining operations to
remove it.

These same crankshafts are excellent examples of how
to eliminate metal that serves no function. Cranksha
main journals and crankpins are usually solid because
of the method used to form them. Made of pearlitic
Malleable iron, these areas can be cored out. This sub-
stantially reduces the weight of the crankshaft

Opportunities at DuPont for technical graduates—fourth of a series

Right now Du Pont needs many new mechanical, electri-
cal, civil, chemical, instrumentation, industrial and sys-
tems engineers, along with chemists, physicists and
mathematicians.
The reason why is very simple: Du Pont manufactures
and sells more than 1200 products. And new ones are
being developed every day.
Take DYCRIL® Photopolymer Printing Plates, pictured
above. We started producing them in 1961. But we had
been working on them since 1948. Between these two
dates we spent $10 million on research and development.
Hundreds of top-flight technical men spent thousands of
hours making DYCRIL commercially acceptable.
And with DYCRIL, as with all of our products, it will
take a continuing flow of man-hours to make sure that it
is manufactured in sufficient quantity-and of optimum
quality—to satisfy growing customer demand.

by Irving Salmeen
Game theory is one of the new space-
age terms that has very little to do with
what its name seems to imply. To most
people, games mean the popular parlor
pastimes: Bridge, poker, chess, etc. Actu-
ally parlor games are only of passing in-
terest to the game theorist.
Game theory is a branch of decision
theory designed to deal mathematic-
ally with conflict of interest situations.
For example; suppose that two indi-
viduals have a chance of winning a
dollar by matching coins. If both in-
dividuals (players, to the game theor-
ist) show heads or tails, player A gets
the dollar. If one shows heads, the
other tails, player B gets the dollar.
The question is, which side of the
coin should each player show, to
maximize his chances of winning the
dollar?
Another example: suppose that a
man and wife plan to go out on Sat-
urday night. The man prefers to go
to the fights, the woman prefers the
opera, and each is willing to give up
his choice so that they can go out to-
gether. If they cannot agree on either
the fight or opera, then they must go
their separate ways. The question is:
which does each choose, the fight or
the opera?
The man thinks to himself, "If I
choose the fights and she chooses the
opera, then we don't go out together.
She is stubborn and won't give in.
Therefore I will choose the opera."
But the wife, unfortunately, thinks
the same way. "If I choose the opera
and he chooses the fights, we don't go
out together. He is stubborn ..."
These examples illustrate the in-
gredients of a game: decision making
under conflict of interest situations.
The generally recognized creator of
game theory is John Von Neumann,
who, in his treatise, The Theory of
Games and Economic Behavior, writ-
ten in collaboration with Oscar Mor-
genstern in 1944, first expounded the
basic theorems. Since the first effort,
many workers have added theorems
and expanded Von Neumann's ideas
into a subtle, sophisticated mathe-
matics. In an article of this type, one
can only state that the theory is math-
ematical, and send the interested
reader to the numerous sources listed
in the bibliography.
Utilities
To talk quantitatively about deci-
sions, one must have some means of
evaluating the decision, i.e., what val-
ue do the players place on the out-
comes that result from a given deci-
sion? In the case of gambling there is
a built in evaluator: money. However
there are an infinite variety of cases
where an automatic measure of out-
come is missing. Consider the follow-
ing example.
Suppose a tired, rich businessman
and a hungry, poor engineer each
has 15 cents in his pocket, each
has a distance of four miles to travel,
and the bus fare is 15 cents. A gam-
bler comes along and offers each an
opportunity to win two dollars by
rolling a die. If a six comes up
then the gambler pays two dollars,
and if any other number comes up,
the gambler wins 15 cents. The tired
rich man says to himself, "Two dollars
don't mean much to me. But I'm
tired and if I have to walk, this will
cause me a great deal of displeasure.
The displeasure of walking is more
than the pleasure of winning. There-
fore I will not take the gamble."
The engineer thinks to himself,
"I'm hungry. Fifteen cents won't even
buy a beer, and if I loose and must
walk the four miles, I won't be able
to eat because I lost my 15 cents. But
even if I ride, I still won't have the

is a chance I might win two dollars,
• in which case I can both eat and ride.
Therefore I will accept the gamble."
To the businessman we say the
utility of having to walk is much less
than the utility of riding. For the
engineer, the utility of winning two
dollars is more than the utility of hav-
ing to walk. The utilities become
quantitative by assigning arbitrary
numerical values to the outcomes,
such that the values reflect the prefer-
ences of the individuals involved.
Suppose to the businessman, win-
ning two dollars would mean a gain
of 5 units of utility, while the four
mile hike would mean a loss of 10
utiles. On the other hand the engi-
neer values the winning of two dol-
lars as a gain of 10 utiles and the
prospect of walking as only a loss of
one. Quite obviously, the method of
assigning utilities is subjective and
depends on the player's sense of
values.
Consider another example. Suppose
one were to ask Sly Drool, the engi-
neer, to order his preferences for bev-
erages. Sly likes milk better than any-
thing (Sly is an eccentric engineer),
prune juice second, and beer third.
One cannot say how much more he
likes one than another, but he can
assign numerical values to his alterna-
tives, so long as they reflect his prefer-
ences.
If milk is worth 3, prune juice 2 and
beer 1, it cannot be said that milk is
three times more preferred than beer;
utilities cannot be operated on arith-
metically or algebraically. Also one
cannot say that milk is preferred over
prune juice because the utility is
greater for milk, rather the utility for
milk is greater because milk is pre-
ferred.
For any situation to which game
theory is to be applied, it is presup-
posed that utility assignments have
been made to the possible outcomes
and the theory proceeds independ-
ently of how the assignments were
made.
Returning to the example of the
man and his wife, the situation can
now be interpreted quantitatively.
Suppose that the man gets 5 units of
pleasure if he goes to the fights with
his wife, 3 units of pleasure if he goes
to the opera with his wife, minus
5 units if he goes to the opera alone,
and minus 3 if he goes to the fight
alone. The wife's utilities are similar:
5 if they go to the opera together;
3, the fights together; minus 5,
fights alone; and minus 3, the opera
alone.
A decision on the part of each
player results in a payoff to each play-
er measured in utilities. These payoffs
can be represented as a payoff matrix.

other's gains. In this case the sum of
the payoffs is zero.
An example serves to illustrate sev-
eral important concepts. Suppose
there are two players A and B and
the payoff matrix is given below. In
this matrix the payoffs are positive to
player A and negative to B.

Here A, corresponds to the man's
choice of the fights; A2 corresponds to
the man's choice of the opera; Bi
corresponds to the wile's choice of the
fights; B2 corresponds to the wife's
choice of the opera. The elements of
the payoff matrix are the utilities of
each outcome. A specification of a
course of action taking into consider-
ation all possible actions of the op-
ponent is called a strategy. For ex-
ample, the man can say to himself, "If
my wife chooses B„ then I will play
A2. If she plays B2, then I will play
Aj." This is one strategy for the hus-
band.
Obviously, it is impossible to stand-
ardize the behavior of people. There-
fore the theory of games makes the
following assumptions:
1. All players are assumed to be
rational. This means they will always
select the strategy that guarantees
them maximum utility.
2. Players have complete knowl-
edge of each other's utilities.
3. Each player knows the alterna-
tives open to him and his opponent
and he knows how the outcomes de-
pend on his choices.
4. Outcomes are independent of
linear transformations on the utilities.
This means that if one player's utili-
ties were to be doubled, the outcomes
would be the same, for the same game.
Two-person Zero-sum games
The analysis of some games is triv-
ial: for example when both players
have the same preference pattern over
the alternative outcomes. The non-
trivial games begin with the case
where the preference patterns of one
are exactly the opposite of the other;
in other words, one's losses are the
Upon first looking at this payoff
matrix, it is apparent that two is at a
strategic disadvantage because the
best he can do is loose nothing, and
all other non-zero payoffs represent
losses to him. If B chooses b, then he
could loose as much as 18, therefore
b, is not a wise choice, similarily b4
is not wise because his loss would be
as much as 25. This leaves him a
choice between b, and b3. By choosing
b3 there is a chance of loosing noth-
ing if A chooses a, however, B cannot
be sure which A will choose. There-
fore B's wisest choice is to select b,
because no matter what A does, he
can loose no more than 4. One says
that B maximizes his security level.
A analyses the situation in a simi-
lar way, but to A all payoffs are posi-
tive. Therefore he immediately elim-
inates a,, a2 and a5 which might
possibly give him nothing. Of the
remaining strategies a, and a4, a, max-
imizes A's utility because no matter
what B does A will get at least 1
utiles.
Thus it seems reasonable that
under the circumstances A and B
would make the choices a., and b,
respectively. The pair (a;(, b2) are said
to be in equilibrium because each is
the best strategy against the other. It
can be proven that the pair (a, bj)
is in equilibrium if and only if (a, b,)
is the maximum of the column j and
the minimum of the row i. In the
above example (a3, b2) is the only
point that satisfies these conditions.

Games and Decisions1, present the
following interesting example: In the

troop and supply convoy from the
port of Rabaul at the eastern tip of
New Britain to Lae, which lies just
west of New Britain on New Guinea.
It could travel either north of New
Britain, where poor visibility was al-
most certain, or south of the island,
where the weather would be clear; in
either case, the trip would take three
days. General Kenney had the choice
of concentrating the bulk of his re-
connaissance aircraft on one route or
the other. Once sighted, the convoy
could be bombed until its arrival at
Lae. In days of bombing time, Ken-
ney's staff estimated the following
outcomes for the various choices:
KENNEYS
STRATEGIES
Northern Route
Southern Route
JAPANESE STRATEGIES
Northern Southern

It is easily seen that there is one
equilibrium point: (northern route,
northern route), with an expectation
of two days of bombing. These in fact
were the choices made; the convoy
was sighted about one day after it
sailed; and the Japanese suffered se-
vere losses. Given the total strategic
situation, which was not particularly
bright for the Japanese commander,
his choice was wise in the sense that
his northern route strategy was at
least as good as his southern route
strategy against either of Kenney's
strategies.
Mixed Strategies
Not all two person-zero sum games
have equilibrium pairs, i.e. there is
no element such that it is both the
maximum of its column and a mini-
mum of its row. An example is:
B
A thinks to himself. "If I choose a,
and B chooses b2 then I get only one.
But if I choose a, and B chooses b2
then I can get 4 and if he chooses bi
then I get at least 2 which is better
than 1. But B thinks to himself, "If
I choose b2 I might loose 4, but if I
choose b, then the most I can loose
is 3."
But A now places himself in B's
shoes and comes to the same conclu-
sion as B, namely it would be wise for
B to choose bv Therefore A, now hav-
ing cleverly deduced B's plan of
action, says to himself, "Since B is
going to choose b, then I'd better
take aj since then I'll get 3." Now B
puts himself in A's shoes and deduces
that A will select a, in which case B
should select b2. And he thinks that
I think that he thinks. . . .
The circumstances of the argument
suggest that A should be indifferent
between aj and a2. If so, he should be
willing to toss a coin to decide be-
tween them. This method of choosing
a strategy using a random device is
known as a mixed strategy. It can be
shown that in the case of no equili-
brium point, there exists a mixed
strategy for each player that maxi-
mizes his utility.
This is, in essence, a statement of
the central theorm of two person
zero-sum game theory: Von Neu-
manns's minimax theorm. First
proved by Von Neumann, it
states that for any two-person zero-
sum game, there is an equilibrium
pair in the mixed strategy sense. This
means that there is some mixed strat-
egy for player A that will guarantee
A at least a„ and a mixed strategy
for B that will guarantee that A will
get no more than a0.
With this theorm, the case of the
zero sum game can be dismissed, be-
cause the theorem provides a recom-
mended mode of behavior to the con-
testants in any zero-sum situation. It
must be pointed out that this "solu-
tion" does not dictate how the players
should act. It only says that if they
act this way, then the results will be
as prescribed. It's up to the players to
decide if the prescribed results are
the ones they desire.
Non-zero Sum Games
So far nothing has been said of the
class of games where the sum of the
payoffs is not equal to zero; the so-
called non-zero sum game. Compared
with the zero-sum case, this category
of games is inherently different. To
illustrate the difficulties, there is the
classical Prisoner's Dilemma.
Two suspects are arrested. The dis-
trict attorney is certain that the two
are guilty of a specific crime, but the
evidence is not adequate to obtain a
conviction. The D.A. presents the
prisoners with the following alterna-
tives:
If they both do not confess, then
they will be booked on some minor
charge, such as petty larcency and
both will receive minor punishment.
If they both confess, they will be
convicted but leniency will be recom-
mended.
If one confesses and the other does
not, then the confessor will get off
lightly for turning state's evidence,
while the holdout will get the book
thrown at him.
Luce and Raiffa2 present the prob-
lem in the following way:
Prisoner 1
Not confess
Confess
Prisoner 2
Not Confess Confess
10 years for 1
3 months for 2
1 year each
3 months for 1
10 years for 2
8 years each
In terms of utilities this matrix
might be
Prisoner 2
Prisoner
r», 5
—1, fi
6, -4
-3. -3
If one were to take the approach of
the zero sum game, then each would
look for the strategy that maximizes
his utility.
For the first prisoner, the worst he
can do is loose 4. Therefore he is bet-
ter off with strategy a2 because it
maximizes his minimum at —3. Now,
player two, after deducing one's alter-
natives has no choice but to choose
b2, for if he were to choose b, he
might loose 4, while b2 guarantees
that he will loose at most 3. Thus the
equilibrium solution is (—3, —3) or
each gets 8 years, which is the worst
they could do. Hence the dilemma:
rational players will not do as well as
irrational contestants. The choice
(5, 5) is better to each, but (5, 5)
is not a rational choice because (at b,)
does not maximize security levels.
Negotiable games
Suppose the two prisoners could co-
operate, obviously they would agree
to the selection of strategies (a! b,)
since this is clearly advantageous to
both. This possibility introduces an-
other category: two-person non-zero
sum negotiable games. This is by far
the most interesting and the most

Mathematics and philosophy are, by the
very nature of the subjects they discuss
and their methods of approach, intimate-
ly related. To show this relation or
"common ground" is the purpose of this
article.
Modern man is feeling ever more
strongly the impact of the exact sci-
ences on his daily life. Not only have
the fields of mathematics and physics
along with the other natural sciences
made life more convenient for him,
they have raised various philosophical
questions as to the very nature of man
and the universe. The most promi-
nent among these fields has been
mathematics—for no other field has
raised as many philosophical ques-
tions as it has. Not only in modern
times have questions of philosophy
been coupled with those of mathema-
tics, but even the early Greeks saw
parallels between the fields.
Questions of mathematics and ques-
tions of philosophy do not come to-
gether as merely coincidental. They
are fundamentally and so strongly re-
lated that an understanding of their
interdependance is necessary for many
of the answers to the problems of
either field. A notable example is
the concept of infinity. Formerly this
concept belonged to philosophy, but
has within the last century come to
play a significant role in mathematics.
In fact, mathematics has been de-
scribed as the science of the infinite.
The infinite, like no other problem
has always deeply moved the soul of
man and has had a stimulating influ-
ence on his mind.
Any attempt to demonstrate a func-
tional interrelation between mathe-
matics and philosophy must necessar-
ily be limited. The most noted of
those who have analyzed the interre-
lation is Bertrand Russell. In his
many books he dwells at length on
the so called "overlapping circles" of
mathematics and philosophy. To con-
vey the substance of his analyses in
these few pages would be impossible.
However a brief indication of the
common area can be made, at least
from an observational point of view.
A View of Philosophy
To proceed any further without a
clear understanding of just what
philosophy and mathematics are
would be sheer folly—for half the
problem in seeing the common
ground is to understand what each
one is in itself. Let us begin with
philosophy. One of the most illumi-
nating definitions is given by Bert-
rand Russell:
"Philosophy as I shall understand
the word, is something between
theology and science. Like theology,
it consists of speculations on mat-
ters as to which definite knowledge
has, so far, been unascertainable;
but like science, it appeals to
human reason rather than to au-
thority, whether that of tradition
or that of revelation. All definite
knowledge—so I should contend—
belongs to science; all dogma to
what surpasses definite knowledge
belongs to theology. But between
theology and science there is a No
Man's Land. . . . This No Man's
Land is philosophy."
Moreover, B. A. Fuller describes it as
a reasoned attempt to ascertain the
character and content of the universe
from the data presented.
In its traditional sense, Philosophy
is taken to include logic, ethics,
aesthetics, metaphysics, and the
theory of knowledge. The above list
can be crudely broken into two
branches: the first is concerned with
the theory of the nature of the uni-
verse and the field of logic; and
the second, with ethical and poli-
tical dex trine and the best way to live.
It is the first branch, which speculates
on the problems of existence, matter,
and the nature of the universe, which
is most closely related to the problem
at hand.
A View of Mathematics
To maintain the discussion along
parallel lines, we will return to
Russell for an explanation of what
mathematics is. He says:
"Pure mathematics is the class of
all propositions of the form 'p im-
plies q,' where p and q are proposi-
tions containing one or more vari-
ables, the same in the two proposi-
tions, and neither p nor q contains
any constants except logical con-
stants. And logical constants are all
definable in terms of the following:
Implication, the relation of a term
to a class of which it is a member,
the notion of such that, the notion
of relation, and such further no-
tions as may be involved in the
general notion of propositions of
the above form. In addition to
these, mathematics uses a notion
which is not a constituent of the
propositions which it considers,
namely the notion of truth."
Although the preceeding definition is
rather abstract, the ideas are at least
intuitively clear. We see the notion of
implication in every algebraic expres-
sion. Consider the following:
x -f 2y = 3
We see that this expression implies
that x is equal to 3 — 2y. We see also
that x is a variable such that when
2y is added to it the result is three.
All mathematics can be strictly and
formally deduced. However, it be-
18

comes deductive only after the various
axioms and postulates are accepted as
being true.
Men of Mathematics and Philosophy
As one first tries to find the com-
mon ground, he is impressed by the
number of men who have excelled in
both spheres of endeavor. Intuitively
one might say by this fact alone that
mathematics and philosophy are re-
lated. As far back as the ancient
Greeks, many have been concerned
with both fields. Plato and Aristotle
are examples. Even before them
Pythagoras had been credited with
having mathematics play an impor-
tant role in his philosophy. In fact,
the concept of incommensurables, e.g.
the square root of two, is the founda-
tion of much of Pythagoreanism; and
ever since his time, the influence of
mathematics on philosophy has been
profound.
To list all those who have been
more or less eminent in both areas
would be useless—for they number in
the hundreds. However, a few out-
standing examples of these men are
Descartes, Leibnitz, Whithead, and
Russell. On examining the work of
these men it becomes quite apparent
that they rely on both fields regard-
less of whether what they are discuss-
ing is mathematical or philosophical.
The fact that we can see the same
men doing two different jobs often
leads us assume those jobs are some-
what similar, if not in substance, at
least in method. This immediate im-
pression can certainly prove nothing.
For in extending this type of logic to
the janitor who is a proficient vio-
linist one is forced to seek a correla-
tion between floor sweeping and fiel-
ding—I doubt there is one.
The Common Ground
Let us seek the connection between
mathemeatics and philosophy on
firmer ground by examining the sub-
ject matter of the two fields. Ferge,
the obscure but "Epoch making"
mathematician, has stated that arith-
metic and pure mathematics are gen-
erally nothing but a prolongation of
deductive logic. Moreover, Jaques
Maritain the noted twentieth century
natural philosopher has gone so far
as to say that mathematics and philo-
sophy are the only deductive sciences
of a pure type. In fact, logical analysis
is the main business of philosophy.
From this we see that for the most
part the method of mathematics and
of philosophy is essentially the same.
To see where the common ground
is the most intense let us examine
that branch of philosophy which is
called logic. Mathematics and logic
were at one time separate; however
mathematics has become more logical,
and logic has become more mathe-
matical. Now it is wholly impossible
to draw the line between the two;
they are one. So much of modern
mathematics is obviously on the bor-
der-line of logic, and so much of mod-
ern logic is symbolic and formal that
that branch of philosophy shares a
close kinship to mathematics.
An important area where our two
sciences come together is in mathema-
tical philosophy which must be dis-
tinguished from the philosophy of
mathematics. It analyzes to greater
and greater abstractions and logical
simplicity the ideas of mathematics.
It tries to seek more general ideas in
terms of the original axioms and post-
ulates. In it we proceed by a method
of dialectic in going backwards to
examine the logical foundations that
we are inclined to take for granted
in mathematics.
Still further the relation extends so
far that even geometry is strongly
allied with philosophy. On this point,
Russell says, "The importance of
Geometry in the theories of knowl-
edge which have arisen in the past
can scarcely be exaggerated." There
have been numerous men who have
turned to geometry as a foundation
or as a means of proof of their ideas
on the nature of matter, the forces in
the universe, and existence. Among
those who say that matter is logically
involved in geometry are Kant,
Riemann, Helmhotz, and Erdmann.
In Descartes, we find the whole theory
of method dominated by analytical
geometry. Kant says, "Geometry is
known to have apodeiectic certainty;
therefore space must be a prior and
subjective [sic]." I give the preceeding
examples not to show a philosophic
theory but merely to illustrate how
geometry is meshed with philosophy.
Philosophers are increasingly ac-
knowledging the common ground.
Herman Weyl claims that no-
where do mathematics and philoso-
phy permeate one another so inte-
mately as in the problem of space.
Furthermore, since philosophy is con-
cerned with things as far as they are
just things (quantities qua quanti-
ties), axioms such as "Equals divided
by equals the remainders are equal"
which are true for all quantities qua
quantities, are a topic of philosophy
also.
The Search for Truth
Many people believe that the im-
portant common ground of philoso-
phy and mathematics lies in the fact
that they both seek the truth. Plato

PROFESSIONAL
TO
WRITING
by Herr Professor Dr. Dipl. Ing. Heinrich Bjoenfjord
The quintessential probity and enig-
matical unintelligibility of professional
technical obscurationism are limpidly
elucidated, trenchantly and epigramma-
tically propounded and expounded, and
metaphrastically illustrated in a manner
aimed at delineationism of the compo-
nent variables and variable components
of nebulous inscrutibalisin with particu-
lar and peremptory enunciations of the
modern concepts of impenetrable hyper-
bolisms and related esotericisms and
cabalastic ritualistic incantationisms ad-
judged to be of such salient salience in
such punctilious parochialisms as hydro-
dynamics, operations research and the
formulation and codification of innova-
tionistic and venerabilistic regulatory
and/or statutory emanationisms.
"You must lie upon the daisies,
And discourse in novel phrases,
Of your complicated state of mind.
The meaning doesn't matter,
If it's only idle chatter,
Of a transcendental kind.
"And everyone will say
As you walk your mystic way,
'If this young man expresses himself
In terms too deep for me, why
What a very singularly deep young
man
This deep young man must be!'"
You will at once note that this little
paper confuses the reader from the
very start, with an aesthetic gem of
little or no relationship to the rest of
the paper. This illustrates very nicely
one of the absolutely essential ingre-
dients of obscure writing: obscura-
tionisrn. The above poem happens to
have been penned by W. S. Gilbert,
a minor Athenian poet, during his
Third Century B. C. imprisonment
in a Byzantine dungeon. The earlier
fad of quoting Ovid, Horace and
other well-known Celtic poets has
now been discarded as an obvious af-
fectation, and the trend continues
strongly towards exploiting the
thought-provoking writings of the
lesser prophets, minstrels and sooth-
sayers of pre-Cheopsian days. Eddie
Guest is an obvious example.
Prelude
Having wandered well off the sub-
ject, as illustrated in the above first
paragraph, one really owes it to the
reader to sooner or later explain (as
confusedly as possible) just exactly
(well, more or less) what it is that one
intends to try to confuse the reader
about which. In this case the author1
intends to spell out in simple,
straight-forward hyberbolisms, the
secrets of how to write learned-look-
ing dissertations without necessarily
knowing very much about what one
is writing about which, if anything.
Interlude
There are, essentially, two major
schools of obscurationism: the Verbal
i A conceited sophistry used in place of the
word "I" to show how modest and demure
the big-headed baboon is who wrote the
treatise. Always adds to the obscurationism.
Note, too, how well a footnote can interrupt
one's train of thought.
Blast, also known as the Mumbo Jum-
bo or Gobbledygook School (used
principally by witchdoctors and auth-
ors of classification society rules and
other regulatory emanations) and
the Mathematical or Hieroglyphics
School (used principally today by the
Advanced Hydrodynamicists). A re-
cent very strong challenge to both
these schools has been hurled down
by the O.R.2 types who have taken
the most obtuse components of both
schools and integrated them into a
formidable phalanx of hyper-obscura-
tionisms.
Pre-PosHude
Having introduced the central
theme or motif, the wise author will
next enhance the obscurationism of
his effort by reverting to the introduc-
tory remarks. In this case, then, let us
return to the traditional poem which
graces the start of such efforts. In
choosing a verse or other quotation,
the obscurationist must keep in mind
that he owes it to his reader to purvey
at the very start some hint as to by
which of the schools of obscuration-
ism his obscurations are to be ob-
scured by which. For example, the
O.R.3 types could very well make use
of the sample demonstrated at the

tions Research. A little care should be exer-
cised in its use, however, since in England
it is generally used as an abbreviation for
"'orse's rear" and the two meanings have
certain overlapping connotations.

matical types might use another of
Gilbert's efforts:
"I'm very well acquainted too
With matters mathematical
I understand equations, both the
simple
And quadratical, about binomial
theorem
I'm teeming with a lot o'news—
With many cheerful facts about the
square of the hypotenuse."
The legal types, too, can find ap-
propriate lines from the immortal
Bard of Athens:
"The Law is the true embodiment
Of everything that's excellent.
It has no kind of fault or flaw,
And I, my Lords, embody the
Law."
When your paper happens to fall
in a program featuring presentations
by other obscurationists, a neat ploy
is to catch the competition off guard
by presenting your little poem in the
original language. Here are a few sug-
gestions:
(a) French
Frere Jacque, Frere Jacque,
Dormez-vous, Dormez-vous?

Central Theme
One may very well ask, why this
sudden renaissance of interest in mak-
ing that which is simple profound
and that which is profound, impossi-
ble? "The answer," according to Pro-
fessor Dr. Ing. Densely St. Menace,
Afghanistanian Theologian, "lies in
the growing groundswell of revulsion
to the politico-economic domination
of the lower classes. Just as the fifteen-
cent subway fare succeeded in elimi-
nating the riff-raff from the New
York Subway System, so now the in-
troduction of obscurationism offers
promise of eliminating the mental
riff-raff from access to the Holy
Grail Secrets of Advanced Science and
Basic Engineering so that these Secrets
may never be dragged into the gutter
of crass usefulness to society."
Selected Secrets
By now the reader may well ask,
"How can I—a plain garden variety
engineer—ever aspire to couch my
thoughts in such lofty sublimities of
obscurationism?" If that's the way
you put it, you have already made a
start.
Certainly the easiest and most ob-
vious first step is to introduce an im-
posing array of mathematical sym-
bols "in serried ranks assembled."
Everyone realizes that the writer who
really knows what he is trying to say
can do so in plain short English
words, but, why not let the reader
guess whether or not you are truly
cognizant of that about which you
have chosen to discourse? And let's
face it, perhaps you're not.
To ease the burden of introducing
mathematical muddles into the pic-
ture, Figure 1 contains a carefully se-
lected collection of choice old mystic
symbols. Just cut these out, add a few
Arabic and Roman numerals and toss
vigorously in a well-oiled salad bowl.
The results are guaranteed to impress
all but the true mathematicians, and
they won't scjueal on you because they
can't understand the few words of
plain English that precede the ava-
lanche of integral signs.

In research and development at IBM, engineers and sci-
entists are exploring new methods, materials, and ideas—
a new world of data processing tools and techniques to ex-
tend the reach of man's mind. In space, IBM miniaturized
computers will guide satellites into orbit, gather informa-
tion from the stars, store data, and relay it on command
back to earth. The IBM developments that make possible
these systems for broadening man's grasp of the universe
—and the new technologies that result from the applica-
tion of data processing systems—form a firm basis for fur-
ther progress in the development of information systems.
IBM is at work on applications of data processing con-
cepts to meet the urgent need for effective information-
handling systems for gathering vast quantities of data
assembling collected data, storage, and making vital in
formation instantly accessible. For example, large-scale
computer systems have been developed for coordinating
the coast-to-coast network of airline flight reservations
Other computer systems handle research calculations
for nuclear and thermonuclear energy. For automatic
bank check processing, systems read characters im
printed on checks with magnetic ink.

PROGRAMMED WEATHER
For centuries man has tried to pre-
dict the weather. And for centuries
man, the weather man in particular,
has had to suffer the wrath of the
multitude when his predictions have
been wrong. However, the weather-
man has now found a scape goat. In
the future you will not be able to
blame him when rain washes out
your picnic or when you are hit by a
hail storm on the 11 th green. The
weatherman will no longer be respon-
sible for these errors in his forecasts
and if you feel you have to blame
someone, you will have to blame his
computer.
The use of computers in the science
of weather and climate is on the in-
crease. Meteorologists here at Michi-
gan have already used a tligital com-
puter to calculate the amount of heat
added to the upper atmosphere by
the formation of oxygen molecules
and to analyze weather satellite ob-
servations. They also have used an
analog computer to solve equations
describing the process of diffusion in
atmospheric situations. And now the
National Science Foundation has
granted $42,100 to the University for
the development of a graduate course
on the application of electronic com-
puters to problems in meteorology.
Meteorologists from the Depart-
ment of Engineering Mechanics un-
der the direction of Professor E.
Wendell Hewson are developing tech-
niques for applying computers to
typical problems in meteorology. In
the words of Professor Hewson, "This
grant will permit us to develop these
new and powerful methods for ex-
ploring the mysteries of our atmos-
phere. As a student learns these new
mathematical methods of problems
solving we may hope to understand
better and to predict more accurately
the strange behavior of the atmos-
phere."
Professor Hewson continues by
pointing out the advantage of this
type of weather prediction and then
speculates on the future. He says,
"These new methods will give us a
better basis for determining how and
why our climate is changing. Perhaps
they will eventually help us to moder-
ate the less desirable features of our
weather. And, with the space program
developing rapidly, a more scientific
study of the atmospheres of other
planets in our solar system is needed."
Professors A. Nelson Dingle and
Edward S. Epstein are in charge of
the instruction of the new course. In
addition to these two gentlemen, sev-
eral distinguished scientists from
other institutions will participate as
guest lecturers.
Only the future will tell whether
the computer will predict the weath-
er or whether it won't, the weather-
men are confident it will. They see a
bright future for the computer in this
role and forecast that the climate will
be not only computer predicted, but
also computer controlled.
ROOM 129 WEST ENGINEERING
Do you know where room 129 in
the West Engineering Building is? If
you are an engineering student here
at Michigan, you probably do, even
if you don't recognize it by its num-
ber. It's the Naval Tank of the De-
partment of Naval Architecture and
Marine Engineering. Every engineer-
ing student has at one time or anoth-
er peered through one of the windows
to this room and gazed at the murky
water of the tank and the dusty ship
models on the racks above the tank.
The following paragraphs contain
some facts and figures on the tank
that you may find of interest.

26
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


The finishing touches are applied to this model as the final preliminary to testing.
The tank was originally built in
1904. It measures 360 feet long, 22
feet wide, 10 feet deep and holds
600,000 gallons of water. These di-
mensions make it the largest univer-
sity-owned facility of its kind in the
country and the second largest tank
of its kind in the country, exceeded
only by the federal government's
David Taylor Model Basin in Wash-
ington, D.C.
A towing carriage runs the length
of the tank and is capable of moving
at the speed of 21 feet per second.
Model ships, built in the model
shop nearby are towed down the tank
by this carriage, while researchers re-
cord such things as the model's
power requirement, resistance and
propulsion.
In the past few years the sponsored
research done by the Naval Architec-
ture Department in the tank has in-
creased tremendously. This rapid in-
crease was the result of a moderniza-
tion program started three years ago.
The program, in turn, was the result
of Professor Richard B. Couch, Chair-
man of the Naval Architecture De-
partment. Some figures on the re-
research increase follow. In 1960 nine
models were built and tested at the
tank. In 1961 the number was 27 and
in 1962 the number was close to fifty.
A few years ago only one model
builder was employed; there are now
six.
The model ships range from six to
fifteen feet in length. They are either
made of wood (California sugar pine)
or wax, depending on the preference
of the research sponsor. The wooden
models take about a month to build,
cost about $1,000 and are usually
turned over to the client after testing.
The wax models require about half
the time for construction and cost
about half as much. After testing they
are usually broken up, melted down
and used again in other models.
The Naval Architecture Depart-
ment has expanded along with its re-
search boom. In the past three years
it has doubled its enrollment and
now, according to Professor Couch,
is the largest of its type in the coun-
try.
I.I.O.E.
Do you know what the IIOE is?
Remember the ICY (International
Geophysical Year) of 1957-58, well,
the IIOE, which means International
Indian Ocean Expedition, is a similar
research effort. However, where the
IGY was concerned with the whole
world the IIOE will concentrate on
one ocean. This multi-nation investi-
gation will study the Indian Ocean
and its effect on the weather.

Much of the data used in determin-
ing the feasibility of a certain hull
design is obtained in the final tank
tests.
A team of University meteorologists
under the direction of Donald J.
Portman will represent Michigan in
the U.S. group that is taking part in
this 12 nation endeavor. The Michi-
gan contingent will concern itself
with the interaction between the
ocean and the atmosphere.
Two of the major fields of interest
for U.S. scientists in the IIOE effort
are the energy exchange between
ocean and atmosphere and atmos-
pheric circulation. Michigan scientists
and engineers will study the interac-

tion between the atmosphere and the
ocean in an attempt to find out how
heat is transferred from the equators
to the poles. Mr. Portman points out
that, "It is this unequal heating that
runs the atmosphere. Until we have
the information we expect to get
from this effort, we won't understand
fully the circulation of the oceans
and the atmosphere. If we don't un-
derstand this, we cannot predict
meteorological situations satisfactor-
ily."
The effort of the Michigan group
will also provide the first good check
out of the Nimbus weather satellite
system. The Nimbus satellite will be
orbiting over the area where Univer-
sity scientists will be making their
measurements. Data taken by the
satellite and by the meteorologists
will be compared. The Nimbus
satellite will also provide radiation
data for the scientists. The Woods
Hole Oceanographic Institution and
the Universities of Hawaii and
Washington are also assisting in the
U.S. part of the project.

said that without mathematics no
true wisdom is possible. Even before
Plato, we see that "According to
some Pythagoreans, physical objects
and their attributes are made out of
numbers; according to Plato, the
Ideas which are the truest of all exist-
ing things and are the causes of the
sensible things are themselves num-
bers." Hippocrates describes those
who have pursued mathematics as the
true lovers of wisdom who have
sought to discover eternal truths.
One striking phenomenon which
belongs exclusively to mathematics
and philosophy is that neither one is
subject to empirical knowledge. The
notions of mathematics are not de-
rived from perception or experimen-
tation. Even if there were no physical
world, the ideas would be just as true
as they are now; two and two would
still equal four. But, physics and the
other natural sciences would be at a
loss—for without the earth it could
not be said that the acceleration due
to gravity is thirty-two. Since the prin-
ciples and causes of philosophy are
farthest removed from the senses,
they are brought into the realm of
mathematics. Russell has us believe
that even knowledge is mathemati-
cal. He says that our knowledge of
the physical world is abstract and
therefore mathematical. We can see
that something is round such as the
sun, but that does not mean this is so.
He questions here the ability of
man to describe the physical world
through his sense perceptions. We
can, for instance, observe the shape of
an object as being round. We then
fit this observation to our system of
knowledge which describes the class
of all round objects. This so called
system is an abstraction and does not
necessarily describe things as they
"really" are. He goes on to say that
logical propositions are such as can
be known a priori without study of
the actual world. We know only
through empirical facts that Socrates
is a man, but we are sure of the cor-
rectness of the syllogism without any
appeal to experience.
The Culture Key
One interesting last point which
some notably Keyser, have used to
support the common ground is that
mathematics is a key to understanding
a culture and hence its philosophy. A
culture which produced Euclidean
geometry was necessarily bounded
and finite. This is shown in Greek
and Roman art both of which had no
regard for perspective. A culture
which produced Faustian mathematics
(whose geometry is infinite with
parallel lines converging at an infi-
nite distance) would be expected to
be dynamic and far reaching. Faus-
tian painting in fact shows this: it is
characterized by vast expanses, and
infinitely receeding horizons. Classical
geometry produced relatively static
self contained temples while the dy-
namic and God-seeking Gothic cathe-
drals are the offspring of the same
spirit that created Faustian mathema-
tics. Classical philosophy in its dis-
tinctive feature is sister to classical
mathematics, just as the Faustian age
is like Faustian mathematics. Keyser
extends this argument to say that
"... among all the expression forms
of a culture, mathematics is by com-
mon consent, significant and funda-
mental."
Keyser goes on to say that mathe-
matics is not only a culture clue but
it also reveals the "distinctive nature
of man. He says:
Hardly any aspect of mathematics
is more striking than the clear reve-
lation it affords of the distinctive
nature of man. For such a revela-
tion we have long been schooled to
look to the traditionally so called
Humanities, and they have been
commonly spoken of as if Mathe-
matics (and Science) were quite out-
side their domain. We are to see on
the contrary, that nothing is better
entitled to rank as one of the great
Humanities than Mathematics it-
self (and a like claim is valid for
Science also). For what is the test? I
hold it to be this: those subjects are
best entitled to membership in the
assembly of the Humanities which
(1) best disclose the essential nature
and the defining characteristic of
Man and (2) best seem to guide our
human life.
It is the time-binding capacity that
distinguishes man from all the other
animals. That is, each generation can
use the achievements of the past to
effect progress. This time-binding
capacity manifests itself more clearly
than any where else in the develop-
ment of mathematics. By this revela-
tion of what in man most distin-
guishes the human race, mathematics
"vindicates" its title to eminent rank
among the humanities.
Also, Keyser regards mathema-
tics as a guide to life. This guide or
"Muse of math" is logical rigor which
demands absolute precision and clear-
ness. Again he contends mathematics
holds its title as a great humanity
since logic can be used as a guide in
human life.
The Change in Perception
Having thus arrived at the summit,
it would be helpful to look at the
path we took in order to realize our
position. To sum up then, we first
observed the many men who are out-
standing in both Mathematics and
Philosophy. Both proceed by deduc-
tion, and logic and mathematics are
closely intertwined. Moreover, geome-
try is of great importance in philoso-
phy. The fact that both search for
truth and are exclusively non-empiri-
cal gives strong evidence for the rela-
tion. And finally, mathematics can be
used as a key to understanding a cul-
ture, its philosophy, and the distin-
guishing attributes of man. Although
it would be very difficult to rigorously
establish a correlation between mathe-
matics and philosophy, it is quite easy
to appreciate the interdependence in-
volved. The recent advances in our
concepts of matter, space, and time,
have been primarily the accomplish-
ments of mathematics and science.
They have, however, produced a
marked effect on man's perception of
himself and his relation to the uni-
verse in which he lives.

reactor being developed by the Alli-
son Division of General Motors un-
der contract to the Atomic Energy
Commission. Covert is one of sev-
eral young engineers now engaged
in various studies connected with
nuclear powerplant engineering
programs at Allison.

• NUCLEAR ENERGY CONVERSION—For the last 5 years, Allison,
the energy conversion Division of General Motors, has participated in the
design of various nuclear powerplants requiring compactness and low weight.
Work on these projects has resulted in the compilation of a formidable back-
ground in nuclear systems engineering for space and terrestrial powerplants.
Announcement by the Atomic Energy Commission of the selection of Allison
as prime contractor for development of MCR (Military Compact Reactor)
now creates opportunities for well-qualified Engineers and Scientists in a long-
range program in the nuclear field.
The MCR is a lightweight, completely self-contained nuclear reactor power
system—easily transportable by truck, aircraft or rail—designed to provide
packaged power for a wide variety of applications. It will have a high
temperature, liquid metal cooled reactor coupled to a power conversion
system. Incorporating long plant life characteristics compatible with military
field equipment, the powerplant is expected to reduce the burden which shipment
and storage of petroleum imposes on combat forces.
Along with its nuclear, missile and space activity, Allison is maintaining
its enviable position as designer and producer of air-breathing engines.
Recent developments include advanced types of turboprop engines for
greater power with maximum fuel economy and without increase in engine
size; a compact lightweight turboprop selected as the powerplant for the
Army's next generation of Light Observation helicopters, and thermally
regenerative gas turbine engines for a wide range of vehicular and
industrial use.
Perhaps there's a challenging opportunity for you in one of the diversified
areas at Allison. Talk to our representative when he visits your campus.

OCEAN FLOOR OUTPOST
This artist's sketch shows how man could explore "inner space" and tap the vast natural resources beneath the ocean
floor through the use of an advanced system of power generation proposed by Westinghouse Electric Corporation. Heart of
the system is an undersea nuclear reactor (left) capable of producing 3000 kilowatts of electricity for life support and oper-
ational activities in a two-mile deep undersea community. At left center is a sphere which would house the crew and
serve as the control center for undersea vehicles used in gathering samples, drilling, mining or exploring.

This new magnetic memory device
that looks somewhat like a miniature
waffle iron has been developed by Bell
Telephone Laboratories. It is an experi-
mental device that can store 64 words
of 30 bits per word. The waffle like
pattern is extremely compact with a
storage density of 1100 bits per square
inch. This compactness permits bits of
information to be read into and out of
the memory in fractions of a micro-
second. Besides being compact, the
waffle pattern provides the storage de-
vice with one of the shortest paths of
any magnetic memory. The short mag-
netic storage path accounts for its
speed and permits it to operate on
low input power.

POWER FOR THE DEEP
Richard C. Cunningham, manager
of the compact reactor systems depart-
ment of Westinghouse Astronuclear
Laboratory, inspects a model of a nu-
clear-thermoelectric power plant cap-
able of producing 3000 kilowatts of
electricity on the ocean floor for man's
exploration of resources under the sea.
The thermoelectric elements would con-
vert the heat from a reactor into
electricity without the need for mov-
ing parts and would be able to with-
stand the pressure two miles below the
surface of the sea. The top portion re-
sembling the solar cell "paddles" of a
satellite is the heat exchanger system
which would provide the means of cool-
ing the power plant.

Piping. It is industry's "circulatory system" ... the con-
veyor of steam, oil, acids, the water you drink, everything
that flows.
Piping can be quite simple. Or enormously complex.
Corrosion, pressure, or temperature, for example, can
present engineering challenges of the first order.
That's why industry so often turns to Grinnell when
piping is involved.
Grinnell is piping . . . piping that ranges from systems
engineered for pure food processing, to power plant
piping, to sprinkler systems for fire protection in schools,
hospitals, factories, buildings of all kinds.

Grinnell offers industry (1) the engineering (from
basic metallurgy to piping systems design and prefabri-
cation), (2) the production facilities (eight large plants
in the U.S. and Canada), (3) the product line (every-
thing in piping), (4) the experience (over 100 years of
leadership in the held) to solve the toughest piping
problems.

consider the following situation pro-
posed by Braithwaite.:l
"Suppose that Luke and Matthew
are both bachelors, and occupy flats
in a house which has been converted
into two Hats by an architect who had
ignored all considerations of acous-
tics. Suppose that Luke can hear
everything louder than a conversa-
tion that takes place in Matthew's Hat,
and vice versa; but that sounds in the
two flats do not penetrate outside the
house. Suppose that it is legally im-
possible for either to prevent the
other from making as much noise as
he wishes, and economically or socio-
logically impossible for either to move
elsewhere. Suppose further that each
of them has only the hour from 9 to
10 in the evening for recreation, and
that it is impossible for either to
change to another time. Suppose that
Luke's form of recreation is to play
classical music on the piano and
Matthew's is to improvise jazz on the
trumpet. And suppose that whether
or not either of them perforins on one
evening has no influence, one way or
the other, upon the desires of either
of them to perform on any other eve-
ning. Suppose that the satisfaction
each derives from playing his instru-
ment for the hour is affected by
whether or hot the other is also play-
ing. Suppose that they put the ques-
tion: Can any plausible principle be
devised stating how they should di-
vide the proportion of days on which
both of them play, Luke alone plays,
Matthew alone plays, neither play, so
as to obtain maximum production of
satisfaction compatible with fair dis-
tribution?"
Suppose the payoff matrix were

The situation can be represented
geometrically (See Figure 1). The
four points are plotted in the plane.
The line AB represents Luke's pure
strategy x, and the line CD corre-
sponds to Luke's pure strategy x2. Sim-
ilarly AC and DB correspond respec-

tively to Matthew pure strategies yt
and y,.
For Luke, mixed strategies corre-
spond to lines joining corresponding
points equidistantly spaced from the
end points of CD and AB. (See Fig-
ure 1). Similarily Matthew's mixed
strategy space consists of lines joining
the same points on lines AC and DB.
The totality of all points determined
by the intersection of all possible
mixed strategy lines, forms the region
R bounded by a parabola. This
region R is the total strategic space if
the game were nonnegotiable. (Fig-
ure 2).
But negotiation is allowed, there-
fore the points of R' become elements
of the strategic set. ThesL' points cor-
respond to joint actions, i.e. the play-
ers act together to determine their
mixed strategies.
From the theory of two-person non-
negotiable games it is known that
there is an equilibrium strategy for
the non-negotiable case. Suppose this
corresponds to the point P in fig. 2.
Now if the players are to enter into
negotiation it seems reasonable to as-
sume that neither player will accept
an amount less than that guaranteed
him by the point P. Furthermore, any
negotiated outcome Q must be such
that there is no point both to the
right and above. Looking at the
diagram, it is apparent that such
points lie on the line segment CB.
This line segment is known as the
negotiation set.
It is a simple matter to say that an
outcome should be an element of the
negotiation set, however, which ele-
ment is it going to be? In two person
negotiable games, this question is the
bone of contention. Unfortunately,
the many approaches to this problem
are too involved to be mentioned
here. Some of the more prominent
solutions have been proposed by
Nash, Shapley, Raiffa and Braith-
waite. Each of these methods selects
a point of the negotiation set as a
"fair negotiated value," but the prob-
lem is that each solution selects a
different point. The question is:
which solution is the fairest?
An answer to this last question
would be nonsense. Individual stand-
ards of equitability are based on so-
cially acceptable conventions. The
theory of games is a mathematical
artifice contrived independently of
social patterns. To attempt to define
fairness would be most difficult be-
cause there is no social precedent
upon which one can rely. Perhaps
as more work is done, and applica-
tions are experimentally tested, a pat-
tern of social aceptance will emerge.
However, to date, the question of fair-
ness must go unanswered.
n-person games
Excluded from this discussion so
far has been the case of n-person
games. The simplest example of this
is n = 3. Suppose 3 engineers have
been given one dollar to divide
among themselves. Further suppose
that all agreements made by any of
the players are binding. Sly Drool and
Slip Stick happen to be sitting next
to each other. Sly says to Stick, "Let's
you and I split the dollar 50-50." But
Igor sitting in the corner overhears,
so he approaches Stick and says, "I'll
give you 60 if you give me 40." Now
Sly is left out and says to Igor, "Why
should Stick get 60? Tell you what,
I'll give you 55, if you give me 15."
And this mad circle continues. The
point here is that one must consider
the possibility of forming coalitions.
In any n-person game, the theory as-
sumes that if one colition forms, the
worst possible counter-coalition is the
rest of the players. Hence the n-person
game has been reduced to a 2-person
game.
This method of reducing the multi-
person game to a 2-person game has
been the most general attack on the
n-person problem. The mathematical
difficulties of n players are formida-
ble, consequently the majority of
work has been aimed at 2 person
games. The above approach to n-per-
son games, poses some obvious diffi-
culties. First of all, why, after one
coalition forms, does there necessar-
ily have to be just one counter coali-
tion? Perhaps the remaining players
divide into two counter coalitions.
What coalitions are most likely to
form, and what is to prevent a player
from jumping from one coalition to
another? Such questions have not
been answered.
If at this point, the reader feels as
though he has been left hanging, his
feeling is justified. An attempt has
lieen made to mention the most
prominent concepts of the theory of
games. These have been:
1. The notion of utilities which
allow one to quantitatively evaluate
decisions.
2. A definition of two-person zero-
sum games and the idea of equilib-
rium strategies along with a qualita-
tive statement of Von Neuman's mtni-
max theorem.
3. A sketchy outline of non-zero
sum games and negotiable games.
4. Finally, an altogether too brief
statement concerning n-person theory.
The reader has been introduced to
terms, unfortunately space limitations
demand that details be omitted.
To attempt to describe, in a short
article, the elements of game theory,
would be like trying to sandwich the
calculus into a pocket book. Game
theory is mathematical. Its theorems
have mathematical proofs. There are
various think factories such as the
RAND Corp., Institute for Defense
Analysis, and Research Analysis Corp.,
specializing in scientific decision mak-
ing, who are attempting to make
game theory into an applied science.
However, at this stage of the game the
postulates and axioms are too ideal-
ized to be applied realistically to so-
cial behavior.

from the X-15 to Schirra's 6-orbit flight — has been
carried back to earth by Collins communication systems.
The men who designed and engineered the equipment
and put these systems together are topnotch experts in
their fields. These are the men you'll have an oppor-
tunity to work with and learn from on a variety of space
communication project assignments. □ Our company is
currently engaged in another phase of the U. S. space
effort, communication systems for NASA's Apollo
manned lunar spacecraft. Again Collins can provide
young engineers with an opportunity to advance and
grow through actual experience on projects such as this
and through close working contact with the experts.
□ Future Collins commitments call for further explora-

Conclusions &amp; Recommendations
Any attempt by an author to make
reading easy by wrapping everything
up into a neat bundle at the end of
the paper is of course passe. It is a
rigorous requirement of all high-level
publications that this crowning effort
be confined to a slightly oblique ad-
mission that the author hasn't really
learned anything worth saying as yet,
but that further studies (and appro-
priations) will surely lead to some-
thing Big.
It is therefore concluded that furth-
er studies (and appropriations) would
indeed lead to further Clarification of
Confusion and it is therefore recom-
mended that further studies (and ap-
propriations) be forthwith decreed in
order to thereto proceed with all
haste anil diligence.

ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING
Electrical Engineering is characterized by diversity. Many of today's most interesting problems result from the need for basic
information. The photographs above illustrate the challenge. Here, the electron density to an altitude of 1,000 miles was to be
measured by a two-frequency beacon in the nose cone of a multiple-stage rocket. The instrumentation was carried out in the Cooley
Electronics Laboratory of the Department of Electrical Engineering, and the firing took place at Wallops Island, Virginia.
While the many, well-known fields of specialization, such as communications, data-processing, computers, feedback control sys-
tems and electronic devices, continue in great demand, we are presently witnessing an increasing interest in the interface areas
where electrical engineering can make great contributions. Examples of these interfaces are found in metal processing, numerical
control of machine tools, instrumentation and telemetry, direct conversion of energy, inventory control, energy beams as working
tools, and the very challenging field of bioengineering. As has been true in recent years, the electrical engineer of the future will
have important responsibilities for the discovery, exchange, orderly processing, and interpretation of knowledge; for measurement
methods and techniques applicable to many areas of engineering, science, and commerce; and for the conversion and control of
energy.
At the University of Michigan, qualified graduate and undergraduate students in electrical engineering are encouraged to
participate in research directed toward the solution of many significant problems in electrical engineering. This research "internship"
results in a more effective engineer, one who appreciates the real world of professional responsibility and the tie-in between theory
and practice.

CONTRIBUTORS. . .
Heinrich Bjoenfjord was born in
a humle Hackensack hogan but, dis-
couraged by the Great Potato Famine,
he emigrated to Rub al Khali at the
age of seven. A brilliant student, he
went on to pursue abstract philosophy
at the Tanganyikan Institut fur Tech-
nologic virtually obtaining his Dr.
Ing. degree in 1913. Desirous of trav-
eling in Europe, he accepted an ap-
pointment as personal bodyguard to
the Archduke Franz Ferdinand of
Austria. He held this position until
June 1914 and the outbreak of the
first work! war. He thereupon found
employment as royal composer to the
Tsar of Russia, Nicholas II. His en-
tire efforts were, for the next few
years, concentrated on the creation of
his monumental opera: "Peleas et
Eurydice," the premier (and only)
performance of which, in 1917, trig-
gered the Russian Revolution. Deter-
mining to try his hand at business, he
opened Sweden's first privately oper-
ated leper colony. Following the na-
tionalization of this failing enterprise,
he undertook the training of the
Royal Sarawakian Poison Dart Fusi-
liers but was forced out of that posi-
tion by the disarmament agreements
of the Washington Conference of
1920. With this kind of background,
it is not surprising that Dr. Bjoen-
fjord should take up teaching and
thus we find him with us today, occu-
pying the chair of Romantic Seman-
tics in the Department of Chimerical
Engineering. He lists sports as his
principal hobby and during the past
few months has served as Strategic
Consultant to Michigan's football and
hockey coaches.

The powder is vitamin E. Vitamin E is essential to human life. Also to poultry and livestock. This much is
enough for about 200 multivitamin tablets. We make so much of it for the pharmaceutical manufacturers
that the operation long ago entered the domain of chemical engineering.
It's an especially interesting kind of chemical engineering, related to the kind we have been developing over
the years in our basic business of manufacturing photographic materials.
Vitamin E is in no way a by-product of photographic manufacturing. Only the engineering skills behind it are
a by-product. They come out of the maddeningly sensitive nature of sensitized film and paper. Now they are
available for the thousands of other fascinating things we make besides vitamin E.
We need more chemical engineers to indoctrinate in our ways. The snapshot business is excellent, but
photography has gone far beyond the snapshot and we have gone far beyond photography. Please drop us
a nofe asking for an explanation of what all this has to do with you.

Services

Holbert B. Miller has managerial
responsibility for General Electee's
Manufacturing Services. This re-
sponsibility includes performing serv-
ices work for the Company in the
areas of manufacturing engineerings-
manufacturing operations and or-
ganization; quality control; person-
nel development; education, train-
ing and communications; materials
management; purchasing and sys-
tems os well as the Real Estate and
Construction Operation. Mr. Miller
holds a degree in mechanical engi-
neering and began his General
Electric career as a student engi-
neer on the Company's Test Course

Manufacturing Careers Offer
Diversity, Challenge
and Opportunity
Q. Mr. Miller, what do engineers do in manufacturing?
A. Engineers design, build, equip, and operate our General Electric plants through-
out the world. In General Electric, this is manufacturing work, and it sub-divides
into categories, such as quality control engineering, materials management, shop
management, manufacturing engineering, and plant engineering. All of these jobs
require technical men for many reasons. First, the complexity of our products is
on the increase. Today's devices—involving mechanical, electrical, hydraulic,
electronic, chemical, and even atomic components—call for a high degree of
technical knowhow. Then there's the progressive trend toward mechanization and
automation that demands engineering skills. And finally, the rapid development of
new tools and techniques has opened new doors of technical opportunity—elec-
tronic data processing, computers, numerically programmed machine tools, auto-
matic processing, feedback control, and a host of others. In short, the require-
ments of complex products of more exacting quality, of advanced processes and
techniques of manufacture, and of industry's need for higher productivity add up
to an opportunity and a challenge in which the role of engineers is vital.
Q. How do opportunities for technical graduates in manufacturing stack up
with other areas?
A. Manufacturing holds great promise for the creative technical man with leader-
ship ability. Over 60 percent of the 250,000 men and women in General Electric
are in manufacturing. You, as an engineer, will become part of the small technical
core that leads this large force, and your opportunity for growth, therefore, is
unexcelled. Technical graduates in manufacturing are teamed with those in mar-
keting who assess customer needs; those in research and development who con-
ceive new products; and those in engineering who create new product designs. I
sincerely believe that the role of technical graduates of high competence in the
manufacturing function is one of the major opportunities for progress in industry.
Q. What technical disciplines are best suited to a career in manufacturing?
A. We need men with Doctor's, Master's, and Bachelor's degrees in all the tech-
nical disciplines, including engineering, mathematics, chemistry and physics. We
need M.B.A.'s also. General Electric's broad diversification plus the demands of
modern manufacturing call for a wide range of first-class technical talent. For one
example: outside of the Federal Government, we're the largest user of computers
in the United States. Just think of the challenge to mathematicians and business-
systems men.
Q. My school work has emphasized fundamentals. Will General Electric train
me in the specifics I need to be effective?
A. Yes, the Manufacturing Training Program is designed to do just that. Seminars
which cover the sub-functions of manufacturing will expose you to both the theo-
retical and practical approaches to operating problems. Each of the succeeding
jobs you have will train you further in the important work areas of manufacturing.
Q. After the Program—what?
A. From that point, your ability and initiative will determine your direction.
Graduates of the Manufacturing Training Program have Company-wide oppor-
tunities and they continue to advance to positions of greater responsibility.

Westinghouse developments will send words and pictures millions of miles from spacecraft to spacecraft
A beam of modulated light extending into
the ultraviolet will some day carry mes-
sages, even TV pictures, from one space-
craft to another, or from a spacecraft to a
satellite, across the vastness of outer space.
This beam will travel 50 million miles with
a single watt of transmitted power. It will
be so concentrated that interception or
jamming will be virtually impossible. A
transmitter about the size of a hatbox will
send messages farther than a conventional
radio transmitter as big as a steamer trunk.
How soon will it be ready? Westinghouse
has already demonstrated its feasibility in
the laboratory.

"atomic generator." This long-lived power source is
fueled with plutonium 238 processed and encapsulated
at Mound Laboratory, which Monsanto Research
Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Monsanto,
operates for the Atomic Energy Commission.
This achievement is important to you because it suggests
the kind of future the Monsanto family offers the young
engineer of exceptional promise. You'll be joining a
company that's ready and able to move vigorously in-
to new fields. And that means plenty of growing room
for you . . . ever-expanding opportunity as your pro-
fessional interests broaden.

Holding the line ... for a richer harvest
Boll weevil, codling moth, leaf rollers, thrips and beetles . . . these are only a few of the thousands
of insects that chew up millions of dollars worth of farm crops each year. Fortunately, however,
they are no match for a new Union Carbide product called Sevin insecticide. In the United States
and many other countries, the use of Sevin has already saved such staple crops as cotton, corn,
fruits and vegetables from destruction by ravaging insects. ► You can now get Sevin insecticide for
your own garden as part of the complete line of handy Eveready garden products that help you grow
healthy vegetables and flowers. Sevin comes from years of research in Union Carbide laboratories
and at an experimental farm in North Carolina where scientists prove out their latest agricultural
chemicals. ► This is only one area in which chemicals from Union Carbide help improve everyday
living. The people of Union Carbide are constantly at work searching for better products
that will meet the needs of the future.

OUR EFFECTIVE HONOR CODE
Forty-eight years ago, the Honor Code was voted into
effect by the faculty upon the request of the students of the
college of engineering. It was then, as it is now, "an ideal—
a philosophy of life based on the cardinal principle that it is
dishonorable to receive credit for work which is not the
result of one's own efforts." Actually this Code establishes
a creed of ethical conduct for the student who has not al-
ready established a similar one for himself. The individual
is then expected to conduct his relations with others during
his college and professional careers according to this Code.
In the statement of this ideal, there is the implication
that this is a very noble philosophy—one which is designed
to appeal to the higher sense of morality and ethics of the
individual. As an idea the Code is dripping with idealism
and altruism, two qualities, which, though well intended,
fail to carry the necessary weight to make the code as effec-
tive as it should be.
Entering freshmen are indoctrinated with the idea that
the Honor Code is a venerable institution here in the Col-
lege of Engineering, and most of them, I would say, are
willing to accept this fact. Each freshman receives a little
antiquated booklet which tells him, in man-to-man straight
talk, what every college man wants to know about our
Honor Code.
Well, I don't imagine that it takes this poor naive indi-
vidual long to figure out that this code is just a little bit
phoney. For instance, in this booklet the statement appears
that the basic principles of the Code (which, by the way,
are sound enough) ". . . not only include honesty in exam-
inations and written quizzes but also (include honesty, ed.)
in all other work such as drawing plates and themes." Again
the thought here is noble and idealistic, but when that
freshie is walking down the hall and he hears, "Don't forget
to save your M.E. 340 lab reports! I'm taking the course next
semester," or if he is perceptive enough to observe that the
6
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


disreputable fellow next to him in Engineering Graphics
101 is using someone's plates to assist him in solving the
problems for the course, he is bound to notice the discrep-
ancy between what his nice little Honor Code booklet said
and what is actually taking place in real life.
So far the student has only been disillusioned by his fel-
low classmates who are petty cheating, and it's a good thing
that he is growing up, and maturing, and becoming more
apathetic towards the whole hypocritical situation. For by
the time he gets to be a sophomore and a junior, he will
notice that his instructors, who feel "that the prevention of
dishonesty . . . should be in the hands of the students rather
than the faculty," are taking a few "necessary" precautions
on their own to prevent students from cheating. In CM.
270, for instance, they keep your term paper until you are
a senior; or in the English composition courses, all of your
themes are kept (safely mind you!) for one semester. Both
of these are departmental policies; however, they seem
to be in opposition to the Honor Code, which was approved
by the engineering faculty some forty-eight years ago.
Please notice that the noble ideal-instillers of the college
of engineering have attempted to implant the Honor Code
philosophy into the neophyte engineer, who is disillusioned
at each turn by his fellow classmates and even by some of his
instructors, both of whom he finds violating the rules of
the Code.
Also please note that I have not considered the gross
cheating, such as cheating on bluebooks. I have intended
to differentiate between gross and petty cheating by con-
sidering the degree or "seriousness" of the offense. In most
courses, coyping lab reports or copying graphics solutions
will not favorably affect the student's grade to any extent.
This type of offense usually represents a "small hurt" which
the student is inflicting upon himself by cheating. Or if you
are a penny pincher, since the student pays tuition, the edu-
cation which the student receives is "equatable" with the
cost of tuition. Therefore, the student, engaging in petty
cheating is getting less for his money than the conscientious
student.

In our search to provide good performance with lighter
powerplants, Ford Motor Company engineers and
foundrymen have pioneered new techniques that now
let us cast our engine blocks with such precision that
much lighter engines are made possible.
New materials used to make cores and molds and new
casting methods enable us to make engine parts with
walls as thick as necessary—but no thicker. This
eliminates weight of extra material which must be used
to provide adequate strength with less precise casting
methods.
Reducing engine weight through precision casting
means more performance per pound—and since

lighter engines mean overall car weight can be
reduced, better fuel economy results.

The universal man of Da Vinci is being
reorganized on a modern level, and his
unknown properties charred for appli-
cation in contemporary technology.
The question of man versus his tech-
nology is one of vital concern. Human
engineering encompasses the efforts di-
rected toward bringing man into closer
harmony with technology. It also in-
cludes the development of machines
which find use in man as an active and
reliable component.
What machines are most evident
in human existence? Depending on
the sex and education of the respon-
der to this question, we might expect
answers including such hardware as
computers, stoves, power tools, trains,
and without a doubt, the auto-
mobile. The answer is not as impor-
tant as recognition of the fact that
we as human beings must deal each
day with countless products of engi-
neering and technology. The machine
either serves man, or man is subser-
vant to the machine. This is only in
the immediate sense, though, for
eventually man is always served by
his brainchild, the machine. Never-
theless, human components are in-
cluded as vital links in many "sys-
tems". Men in these situations be-
come part of (or serve) "machines".
Human elements in engineering come
into the picture here, because the
rapid advances of the past two dec-
ades have required that man inspect
his relationship with the machine and
attempt to maximize certain func-
tions depending on biological, and
therefore complex, variables.
Today, a manufacturer would no
sooner want to "engineer" a chair
that is incompatable with the human
anatomy than a voltmeter that was
difficult to read. An inhuman chair
(perhaps the reader has tried to sit in
one?) is really no more absurd than
an unreadable voltmeter or perhaps
a radio that is difficult to tune. Elec-
tronically, the voltmeter may be per-
fect, and the chair may be a struc-
tural, if not esthetic, masterpiece.
These examples are not as unrealistic
as one might imagine. The fact re-
mains that we must allow for the
human element in our systems, we
must study the principles of human
engineering.
Some first considerations can be
observed in the design of automobiles.
The importance of the human ele-
ment is a source of constant concern
to manufacturers. To design a seat
which will accommodate human be-
ings ranging in height from five to al-
most six and one half feet while main-
taining adequate visibility and
strength, to design a steering wheel
which will give under the stresses in-
duced in a crash are typical of tasks
which have concerned engineers for
some time. The recent innovation of
seatbelts is yet another product of ef-
forts of engineers to improve the re-
lationships between men and ma-
chines. Perhaps we might observe a
whole area of effort in which men
strive to learn about the complex re-

In order to transmit intelligible sound
by radio, radio waves must be "modu-
lated." The theory is to vary some proper-
ty of the radio wave in a manner corre-
sponding to audible sound, transmit this
altered wave, and receive it so as to
cause its "altered nature" to produce a
replica of the original sound. The two
basic forms of modulation, Amplitude
Modulation and Frequency Modulation,
are discussed
Any student of high school or col-
lege physics knows that electromagne-
tic radiation propagates through air
or vacuum at the speed of light. The
key to useful radio transmission,
however, lies in superposing intelli-
gence on this otherwise useless radia-
tion. This is the process of modula-
tion. Many methods of encoding
knowledge have been developed.
The first, was Marconi's. He used
on and off keying of radio waves
to transmit and receive messages in
a manner very similar to that used
in land telegraphy. This was a fan-
tastic step forward in communica-
tion but it left much to be desired.
Message speed was limited by the
operator's ability to mentally encode
and decode the transmitted pulses.
Human voice and music could not be
transmitted at all. The very complex
waveforms of voice and music could
not be represented by a binary code.
Some method of transforming these
complex waveforms up to radio fre-
quencies where they could be trans-
mitted was needed. With the advent
of vacuum tubes and a better under-
standing of alternating current theory
it was possible to superimpose audio
frequencies on a radio wave and
transmit sounds in their full fidelity.
It is not possible to combine radio
and audio frequencies by a simple
addition. In a passive linear circuit,
many frequencies may be present
simultaneously but they will not in-
teract or effect each other in any way.
This is born out by the superposition
principle for linear circuits. A modu-
lation system must thus be composed
of some nonlinear circuit that allows
the radio and audio frequencies to in-
teract and form some useable result
that can be radiated in the radio
spectrum and yet contain audio infor-
mation.
There are two basic forms of modu-
lation, Amplitude Modulation and
Frequency Modulation. As the names
imply, AM involves varying the am-
plitude of a radio wave at an audio
frequency and FM involves varying
the radio wave's frequency. In any
modulation system the purpose is to
vary some property of the radio wave
with an audio signal, transmit this
varying radio signal, and then receive
and decode it producing a replica of
the original audio signal.
Figure 1 shows a block diagram of
a basic AM transmitter. The variable
frequency oscillator or frequency
standard is used to generate a radio
frequency. The frequency multipliers
are used to raise the generated fre-
quency up to the desired transmitting
frequency. In the modulator the
audio and radio frequencies are com-
bined to produce a radio frequency
whose amplitude varies with the
audio frequency. The linear amplifier
is used to raise the power of the
modulated signal for transmission.
A simplified Amplitude Modulator
is shown in Figure 2. In the follow-
ing discussion a I megacycle transmit-
ing frequency is used as an example.
With the 1 Mc. signal applied to the
grid of the tube and no audio applied
to the modulation transformer the
signal is simply amplified and appears
at point P as a 1 Mc. sine wave with
a DC reference level. The equation of
this waveform is
Vt = R + Asinwt,
where
R = DC reference level
A = peak amplitude of sine wave
w = 2rri = 6.28 X 108.
For simplicity we can let R and A
equal i/2 unit in the following discus-
sion. This waveform is shown in
Figure 3A. It is a 1 Mc. sine wave
with a peak to peak voltage of one

carrier.
If a modulating signal at some
audio frequency is then applied to the
modulation transformer primary, A-
A, it will appear in the secondary, B-
B, as an AC voltage that will add or
subtract from the magnitude of the
DC plate voltage. In this example
we will consider a 1000 cycle tone as
the modulating signal. The equation
of the voltage on the secondary of the
modulation transformer will then be
V, = COS oc t,
where
oc = 2tt( = 6.28 X 10 '.
This waveform is shown in Figure 3B.
The use of a sine wave simplifies the
subsequent equations to a degree that
can be easily understood. Because of
the complexity of a voice or music
waveform it is virtually impossible
to analyze it. However, as shown by
a study of Fourier Series it is possible
to represent any periodic waveform as
the sum of a series of sine waves at
different frequencies, amplitudes, and
phases. Although the waveform of
voice or music is not strictly repeti-
tive, any portion of the waveform
over a small period can be shown to
closely approximate a repetitive sig-
nal. Thus the results of a study of
sine waves can be combined to give a
representation of the response to
voice or music.
The result of the combination of
the modulating waveform and the
carrier is shown in Figure 3C. This
signal is simply the 1 Mc. carrier with
its amplitude varying at the audio
frequency. The equation of this wave-
form is
"a' *—b—' * ?—
=3+3COSt+Jr.Slf\lwt
-r-irSIISKw-K^t + i5IN(«^«yt
where
a = DC; amplitude of carrier
b = audio voltage added to DC
c = carrier
We see from Equation 3 that the
process of Amplitude Modulation is
very much like multiplication of two
different frequencies. In fact the ideal
Amplitude Modulator is an ideal
multiplier. Upon carrying out the
multiplication and using appropriate
trigonometric identities to simplify

the equations we see that the resul-
tant equation is actually the sum of
a DC voltage and lour different fre-
quencies; the audio, the carrier, and
the sum and difference of the audio
and the carrier. The sum and differ-
ence frequencies are called the upper
and lower sidebands, respectively.
When the signal of Equation 3 is
passed through a circuit with the cor-
rect frequency response to couple it
to an amplifier or antenna, the DC
reference level and the audio fre-
quency are lost and a new zero refer-
ence level is established. The new
reference level is at all times the in-
stantaneous average of the positive
and negative peaks of the waveform.
The resulting signal is the characteris-
tic envelope waveform of Amplitude
Modulation shown in Figure 3D. The
equation of the envelope pattern is

i/2 sinwt -\- \/A sin (w + oc)t)
+ J4 sin (w — oc )t.
Thus the signal that is finally trans-
mitted consists of the original carrier
frequency and the two sidebands.
The AM signal used in this exam-
ple was 100% modulated. By this we
mean that the maximum amplitude
of the modulating waveform has the
same peak voltage as the carrier. Un-
der these conditions, the transmitted
signal has a peak value of twice the
peak value of the carrier and a mini-
mum of zero. If the modulating sig-
nal is less than the amplitude needed
for 100% modulation, the resulting
signal will be under modulated as in
Figure .HE. This condition will not
cause distortion but it does not use
the transmitter's capabilities to the
fullest. On the other hand, if the
modulating voltage is too high, the
envelope will be zero for a finite time
as in Figure 3F. Under this condition,
a large number of spurious sidebands
are generated resulting in a great deal
of distortion. The presence of these
spurious sidebands can be shown by
expanding the waveform of Figure 3F
in a Fourier Series. The percentage of
modulation is given by the height of
the envelope variations devided by
the height of the carrier, x/y in Fig-
ure 3E.
As mentioned previously, the pur-
pose of modulation is to encode audio
signals onto radio frequencies for
transmission and reception. The de-
sired audio information is the fre-
quency oc. and the audio amplitude.
A close observation of the transmitted
signal, Figure 3D, and Equation 4,
shows that the carrier contains none
of the desired information and that
each of the sidebands contains a term
including the audio frequency. The
sideband amplitude will also vary
with the amplitude of the audio while
the carrier remains constant under all
conditions. The carrier thus is com-
pletely superfluous and the sidebands
are redundant in that they each con-
tain the same information. In trans-
mitting AM though, we are forced to
waste power in amplifying and trans-
mitting all three components of the
signal. Because of the large amount of
wasted power involved in AM several
modifications have been developed.
The first attempt to save power was to
remove the carrier before amplifica-
tion and transmission. Since the car-
rier accounts for at least half of the
signal in a normal AM signal a sub-
stantial saving is thus accomplished.
The sidebands are still redunclent
though. A second saving in power is
possible if we also remove one of the
sidebands, leaving just the bare min-
imum of signal needed to transmit all
of the required information. The type
of signal transmitted with no carrier
and one sideband is called Single
Sideband Suppressed Carrier. Single
Sideband, or SSB for short. When just
the carrier is suppressed we have
Double Sideband, DSB. In either case
the final amplifier in the transmitter
need not handle nearly as much pow-
er as an AM transmitter for the same
amount of information transmitted.
Two basic methods of generating
Single Sideband are shown in Figure
4. The first one called the filter meth-
od uses a highly selective filter to re-

What is TECHNIRAMA?
On Saturday and Sunday, May 4th and 5th, the
Engineering College will present TECHNIRAMA, a
program of technical displays designed to inter-
est all future professional engineers. All
departments of the Engineering College are now
in the process of constructing displays that
will emphasize new developments in engineering.
The Phoenix Laboratory, hypersonic wind tunnel,
electron microscope, computing center, ship
hydrodynamics laboratory, and the new LeBlond
Tape Turn are a few of the more outstanding
exhibits of modern engineering research and
technology. TECHNIRAMA is a must for anyone
interested in the field of science or engineering.
Weekend Schedule
May 4 9:00-5:00
May 5 1:00-5:00
East and West Engineering Buildings - Main
and North Campus, U of M
Ann Arbor, Michigan
The uranium fuel core (left) surrounded by
forty-one thousand gallons of clear water is the
heart of the Phoenix Laboratory, located on the
North Campus.


PHOENIX LABORATORY
The Phoenix atomic research program, located at
North Campust is a unique non-governmental effort
consisting of 167 research studies ranging from
archaeology to zoology. Financed by private
donations of eight million dollars, the Phoenix
program is the outstanding undertaking of its
kind in the nation. While touring this building
the most memorable sight will be that of blue
glow around the core caused by particles moving
faster than the speed of light in water.
HYPERSONIC WIND TUNNELL
All engineers should be interested to learn how
the principles of relative velocity are put into
practice on this wind tunnel which Is capable of
simulating Mach 20. The main contribution of
this wind tunnel is an increase in the period of
time available for experimentation at high Mach
numbers. This type of tunnel has made possible
many of the developments in heat resistant sur-
faces for vehicles. The uniqueness of this
exhibit should hold the interest of all who visit
TECHNIRAMA.


THE COMPUTING CENTER
The computing center is a unit of the Graduate
School. It is maintained as a research and
service facility for the faculty, research staff
and students of the University. The main compo-
nent of the center is the IBM 7090 computer.
TECHNIRAMA will enable anyone who wishes to
inspect the computer from a closer than normal
distance an opportunity to do so on Saturday
afternoon.
COMPUTER CONTROLLED MACHINE LATHE
A new addition to the machine tool laboratory is
the LeBlond Tape Turn. The Tape Turn is a proto-
type constructed by LeBlond Company. They used
this computer-controlled lathe to develop their
final production model. The machine Is run by an
eight channel punch tape. For complicated cutting

SHIP HYDRODYNAMICS LABORATORY
The ship hydrodynamics laboratory, located in the
West Engineering Building, was built at the turn
of the century. This 360-foot ship model labor-
atory today remains one of the few ever built in
this country. It is used for testing wax and
wood models and also used for shaft and propelle]
propulsion tests. The University not only main-
tains these facilities for our use but also ful-
fills government and private contracts in the
lab. Don't miss this opportunity to take a ride
on the towing carriage and see how the data is
collected.
THE ELECTRON MICROSCOPE
Capable of magnification of up to 200,000X, the
electron microscope has become an integral part
of all research projects where minute observatior
is necessary. Made in Japan by Electron Optics
Ltd., the microscope is a combination of contri-
butions from many fields of engineering and Is
only one of the high points of TECHNIRAMA.
The electron microscope (right) which is located
on the 4th floor, East Engineering Building, will
be in operation and will give you an opportunity
to see a few of the unusual shapes which occur ii

FUTURE TRANSPORTATION
The passenger station shown in the artist's sketch is part of an entirely new concept in rapid transit systems for metro-
politan areas proposed by Westinghouse Electric Corporation. The completely automated system is designed around the
use of a 20-passenger vehicle, traveling at speeds up to 50 mph on a tresspass-free ariel closed-loop expressway. The
electrically driven trains will be capable of handling 5,000 to 14,000 passengers per hour depending upon the traffic
density. Computer controlled, the trains will be dispatched automatically 24 hours a day and the waiting time between
trains will be less than two minutes. Though the system was designed to meet the needs of a large metropolitan
area, station 14 (above), and ones like it could very well be found in the Ann Arbor of the future. At any rate, the sys-
tem would certainly beat driving and parking in the Ann Arbor of today.

SUPERCHARGED TURBINE ENGINE
Within two years after being awarded a joint Army-Navy contract,
Ford Motor Company Engineers designed and built a 600 H.P. supercharged
gas turbine engine. Developed for use in many military applications, the en-
gine (designated Model 705) is a very compact package measuring 49 inches
high by 44 inches wide and 38 inches high. The unique feature behind Ford's
turbine is superchargine, employed in two compression stages—a feature
never before attempted by any manufacturer in an engine under 5,000 H.P.
in size. This allows the engine to use less air, maintain excellent fuel
economy, and use smaller parts running at high speeds. A right cutaway
diagram above shows the path taken by the compressed air through the
various stages in the engine. The combustion chambers and the details of
the turbine's reduction gear box for the primary and auxiliary power take-
offs are shown in the cutaway of the left side. The Model 705 is currently
being subjected to intensive operating and performance tests. This is the
second stage in its military development before being adapted to use
as a power plant for tanks, minesweepers, hydrofoils, electrical generation
systems and many other things.

These four General Electric scientists above are members of a team that has developed a high temperature fuel
cell that uses inexpensive hydrocarbons as a fuel in place of hydrogen gas used in prototype fuel cells. An experimental
model of this cell is shown below along with a schematic diagram of its operating principle. Natural Gas (Methane) or
other hydrocabon fuels pyroliie when they reach the "hot zone" of the cell (2000 F) forming hydrogen and carbon
which deposits itself on the outside of the solid zirconia electrolyte (white cylinder). The zirconia electrolyte forms a crucible
which contains a small amount of molten silver, in which oxygen from the air is continuously desolving. Oxygen ions move
out of the molten silver through the zirconia electrolyte and combine with the carbon electrode forming carbon monoxide
and releasing electrons. The electrons are conducted out of the cell as a current while the hydrogen and carbon mon-
oxide gases are burned to provide the heat for sustained operation. Maximum efficiency of fuel cell batteries of this type ,
is about 30% whereas by comparison an internal combustion engine is about 20% efficient.

lationships mentioned, but in so do-
ing we would in no way define the
whole discipline encompassed by the
field.
Psychology and Engineering
Now that the basic aspects of fit-
ting man to those systems to which
he must adapt have been mentioned,
a look at those situations in which
man may find it to his advantage to
adapt is in order. In designing appar-
atus an engineering approach which
dictates only mechanical and elec-
tronic components may lead to great
Unary, psychologist engineers are to-
day attacking problems lying in areas
related to both fields. For example,
the psychologist studies the mech-
anisms through which man reacts to
stimuli. He can, among many other
things, draw empirical conclusions
and postulate models of behavior.
The engineer can often use the
knowledge thus collected to optimize
system behavior. The proper reading
of a crucial instrument in an aircraft,
for example, may be aided by engi-
neering application of the psychologi-
cal theories of preception. I empha-

ment of psychological theories, or in direct application to engineering practice.
cost. Human abilities and skills can
be adapted to many systems with a
reduction in costs. Man will adapt to
the psychological conditions if those
conditions are not too severe. There-
fore, if an engineer specifies a human
"component" in a system he must de-
cide whether man will make a psycho-
logical fit. If he is to avoid overreach-
ing himself he must himself become a
psychologist or consult others prac-
ticed in this discipline. Psychology is
playing an increasingly important
role in engineering effort. Interdiscip-
size "engineering," because the "hu-
man" engineer is, like any other engi-
neer, responsible for results. Where
theory and practice diverge, the engi-
neer may, of necessity, contribute to
new scientific knowledge. Human en-
gineers are not in general psycholo-
gists or M.D.'s. They undoubtably
benefit from knowledge of many di-
verse areas.
Biology and Engineering
We cannot in practice or theory
separate the biological from the psy-
chological aspects of man. Human
engineers are vitally concerned with
the problems of man as an organism.
Here they may in fact "cross swords"
with a new breed of Bio-Engineers
(see Feb. '63 Michigan Technic). This
only goes to point up the movement
of engineers into many unexplored
fields where solutions to practical
problems are in demand.
The large scale efforts behind the
man in space program, which date
back many years, provide an example
of an integrated approach. What are
the effects of acceleration? Of weight-
lessness? Of isolation? These are a
few of the problems encountered,
many of which have been solved in
whole or in part, in connection with
the Mercury "man in space" project.
Weightlessness experiments were con-
ducted by the Air Force several years
ago in order to deduce some of the
effects of weightlessness on man. It
was not known whether zero gravity
effects would impair the capabilities
of future space travelers. The experi-
ments, conducted by the Aero Medi-
cal Laboratory at the Wright Air De-
velopment Center, were designed to
explore all areas of importance to a
astronaut under zero gravity condi-
tions. A small transport was specially
outfitted and instrumented to serve as
a zero gravity laboratory. The air-
craft Hew a parbolic arc which en-
abled experiments to obtain weight-
lessness for twelve to fifteen seconds,
perform experiments, and collect
data.
The Total Concept
The man in space program pro-
vides additional examples of the total
application of human engineering to
an objective. Life support is of vital
concern. How do we supply oxygen
for a space flight? Which of the
methods available is most efficient for
a given mission? These problems re-
quire analysis, knowledge of the life |
sciences, and the ability to synthesize ■:
systems equal to their tasks.
There is yet another aspect to hu-
man engineering, and that is appli-
cation of engineering principles to
problems involving human function
and task orientation. Task analysis

systems tries to integrate man to his
machine oriented tasks. This was re-
ferred to earlier, but deserves further
comment. It has been suggested that
man and machine functions are not
really so alien to each other as may
seem at first inspection. In an opera-
tional system it may be necessary to
have some degree of interchangea-
bility between human and mechanical
components. The final analysis, in
fact, demands that the unique psy-
chological properties of man be taken
carefully into account. He must be
given tasks commensurate with his
abilities.
Prof, of Psychology, Paul M. Fitts
in a recent article in "Aerospace En-
gineering" points out that the allo-
cation of human components in sys-
tems must account for man's unique
abilities and shortcomings. Prof.
Fitts notes that, "Low information-
handling rate and inability to carry
on parallel operations are perhaps his
major limitations," while man's abili-
ties are found in, "such things as
versatility, ability to trade off time
lor accuracy, adaptive capacities,
ability to estimate probabilities,
ability to use judgment, and ability
to devise heuristic procedures and to
take action in the face of uncertain-
ties." In this light we can see that
the problem is not always fitting man
to a given task, but deciding which
tasks man is best equipped for. Prob-
lems in economics also find answers in
careful consideration of human versus
machine system costs.
Human engineering is a subject
that defies limitation. Through the
range of engineering practice, we in-
evitably find variables in the human
element of the relationship between
man and his technology. That is not
to say that we have complete control
over those parameters which exist on
the purely physical scale. The devel-
opment of human engineering prom-
ises to maximize man's usefulness to
himself and the machine's usefulness
to man. In the elevated state of con-
temporary science, human engineer-
ing is in a sense an indication of the
reality of the essential value of man.

EDUCATION AND RESEARCH
by Karl Legatski

The six man glaciological research team begins a three month field trip across Ross Ice Shelf to measure the
movement and change in the world's largest mass of floating ice.
Antarctica
Ninety per cent of the world's ice
is in frigid Antarctica. If it should
melt quickly—a most unlikely event—
the oceans of the world would rise
some 200 feet, with dramatic results.
A University of Michigan glaciol-
ogy research team has just returned
from the cold continent after finish-
ing another in a series of expeditions
designed to measure the movement
and metabolism of Ross Ice Shelf,
world's largest mass of floating ice.
The six-man party, led by Dr.
Walther Hofmann of Munich, Ger-
many, traversed some 860 miles across
the vast ice shelf, which has a total
area roughly that of Michigan, Ohio,
Pennsylvania and New York com-
bined. The group extended the origi-
nal line of stakes, which had been set
out on the ice shelf five years ago, by-
placing 12-foot aluminum poles at
five mile intervals. These markers
later will be remeasured for infor-
mation about movement and defor-
mation of the ice shelf.
The Michigan research is part of a
long-range study of Antarctica and its
icecap, a mass of over seven million
cubic miles of ice which by its exis-
tence governs the present relationship

watt Ford Nuclear Reactor. Beam tubes may be seen extending through the re-
actor wall from near the core, and are used to guide neutrons to experiments.
The control room is seen in the background.
between sea and land in all coastal
areas of the world.
Nuclear Energy
With the attainment of commercial-
ly competitive power from controlled
fission (the splitting of the atom)
"right around the corner," the next
big step is to obtain power from con-
trolled fusion (the power released by
the combining of two nuclei into one).
Here at the University of Michigan
several projects are being carried out
at the Phoenix Project along these
lines.
Fusion occurs in a plasma—an ex-
tremely hot gaseous mixture of par-
ticles that result from atoms which
have been broken down into negative
electrons and positive nuclei. The
idea is to get two nuclei to join and
form one atom, a process that re-
leases energy. If controlled fusion
were possible it would result in a
common substance in sea water be-
ing used for fuel. The problem in
controlling fusion has been that the
plasma has been impossible to con-
tain. Since it is electrical, a strong
magnetic field has been used in at-
tempts to contain it. But the plasma
does not remain confined—it bolts out
of its "magnetic bottle" lowering its
temperature below the critical point
at which the reaction occurs. Stabili-
zation of such oscillations in a hot
plasma is the concern of one of the
new Phoenix research projects being
carried out by Associate Professor
Rudi S. B. Ong of the Aeronautical
Engineering Department.
Interest in converting nuclear en-
ergy directly into electrical energy is
emphasized by the fact that at the
present time, the system we use is al-
most identical to the one James Watt
used nearly 200 years ago for con-
verting steam into electrical energy
through mechanical energy. Nuclear
power reactors are being used pri-
marily for their heat, which is used
to convert water to steam, that in
turn drives turbines that generate
electricity. The problem is to go di-
rectly from nuclear energy to elec-
trical energy. Chihiro Kikuchi, pro-
fessor of nuclear engineering, is study-
ing thermo-electric materials to deter-
mine their properties as they might
be useful to the direct conversion of
nuclear-heat energy into electric
power.
In another project, Dr. Byron S.
Berlin, assisstant professor of epide-
miology, is investigating the possi-
bility of using a blood substance as an
indication of the extent of injury
caused by radiation.
Engineers at The University of
Michigan have simulated heat trans-
fer problems which will occur in the
upper stage of the Saturn earth-to-
moon rocket.
In the experiment cryogenic sub-
stances, primarily nitrogen, are
studied under conditions of greater
than, less than, and normal gravity in
order to obtain data on surface tem-
peratures, heat-transfer rates, and
vaporization and boiling at various
gravity conditions. Zero gravity, or
weightlessness, a condition encoun-
tered in the space vehicles that use
these cryogenic fluids, can be obtained
in the laboratory by absolute free fall.
A test package, with the fluid and
suitable instrumentation, is allowed

drop takes 1.4 seconds and the entire
experiment must be completed in this
time. Conditions of partial gravity
are obtained on the same apparatus
by a counterweighted free fall.
Since conditions of gravitational
forces greater than those on earth
will be experienced in space explora-
tion. These conditions will also be
produced in the Heat Transfer and
Thermodunamics Laboratory on a
giant centrifuge which is now in the
advanced testing stage after two years
of development work. It was designed
and built by the Laboratory staff un-
der sponsorship of the National Sci-
ence Foundation. This centrifuge, can
produce gravity conditions which are
far in excess of the present require-
ments for data on the behavior of
cryogenic fluids at high gravity.
From results to date, it appears that
nucleate boiling (such as in teakettles)
is not affected by near zero gravity al-
though three other boiling forms
(maximum heat flux, transition, and
film boiling) are gravity sensitive. The
results of the project, which is sup-
ported by the National fe Aeronautics
and Space Administration, are im-
portant in that the upper stage of the
Saturn rocket will travel through
space under zero gravity and the heat
transfer problems of liquid fuels must
be simulated for use in design of the
rocket.
Astronomers
University of Michigan radio as-
tronomers have successfully measured
the polarization of radio waves from
space. Their findings confirm prev-
ious observations in this new area of
interest, extend measurements to a
number of new sources, and may help
to resolve one of astronomy's latest
and most puzzling questions. That
question is how to account for the
staggeringly large amounts of energy
contained within certain radio galax-
ies described as island universes of
stars. Measurement of several natural
radio sources in the sky at a fre-
quency of 8,000 megacycles has been
reported. The total energy in these
radio sources is so great—equivalent
to the complete conversion of 10 stars
to energy each year of the sources exis-
tence—that it can't be satisfactorily
explained. Their measurements of
polarization help reveal the orienta-
tion in space of the magnetic field of
the source—an important piece to the
puzzle of the enormous energy re-
quired to account for the intensity of
radio waves from such sources.
Polarization of the radio waves re-
fers to the orientation in space of the
plane in which the waves oscillate.
This plane is detected and deter-
mined by mounting a rotatable and
precise waveguide horn at the focus of
a radio telescope. If they have polari-
zation, this shows up as regular (sinu-
soidal) waves on the graph of the in-
coming radiation, corresponding to
changing rotational positions of the
horn. Because polarization of the sig-
nals is created by the radiation-emit-
ting electrons spiralling around lines
of force in the radio galaxy's magnetic
field, it is then a matter of calculation
to determine the orientation of the
field as it appears at the earth. By
studying polarization at short wave-
lengths a complicating phenomenon
known as Faraday rotation—caused by
presence of electrons and a magnetic
field in the space through which the
wave travels—can be virtually elimi-
nated through mathematics to yield
a more precise measurement of the
orientation of the magnetic field.
The importance of the U-M meas-
urements is that they extend the
range of data at these short wave-
lengths to more sources. These meas-
urements can also help determine the
shape of distant galactic magnetic
fields, and perhaps give clues about
how radio galaxies got in this con-
dition.

The University of Michigan 85-foot steerable radio telescope is one of the finest
of its kind in resolution, or its ability to distinguish detail. In operation since
the fall of 1959, it has been used to make the first unambiguous measurement
of the temperatures of the planets Saturn, Mercury and of a planetary nebula
—a remote and gas-surrounded dying star.

move the unwanted sideband. In the
second system two phase shift net-
works are used to generate the side-
bands in a phase relationship that
cancels out one of them, thus the
phasing method. Because it is very
difficult to construct filters sharp
enough to seperate the sidebands at
high frequencies, the filler system
generates the modulated signal at a
frequency of about 500 kilocycles,
filters off one sideband, and then beats
the remaining sideband with a high
frequency to produce the desired
transmitting frequency.
In either system the sidebands are
generated without the carrier in a
balanced modulator. A simplified
balanced modulator is shown in Fig-
ure 5. If the diodes have equal for-
ward resistances, no if can pass when
there is no modulation applied. When
audio is applied, it unbalances the
bridge circuit by biasing the diodes in
one path, depending on the instantan-
eous polarity of the audio signal, and
thus allows an amount of audio pro-
portional to the audio amplitude to
pass. The result is two sidebands
identical to those in AM but without
carrier.
In reception of an AM signal, the
modulated signal is first rectified and
then the rf is filtered out to leave the
original audio signal as shown in Fig-
ure 6. Single Sideband reception is
accomplished by adding a carrier to
the sideband in the receiver with a
local oscillator. The result of this ad-
dition can be detected in the same
manner as an AM signal. In Double
Sideband a carrier is inserted in the
same manner as in SSB but it must
be inserted precisely halfway between
the two sideband frequencies and in
exactly the right phase relation. This
insertion is very difficult without ex-
treme frequency stability that is usual-
ly not available. For this reason DSB
has not been used to any great extent
in commercial applications. The SSB
carrier insertion, however, is not at
all critical. Insertion out of phase or
slightly off frequency will result only
in a change in the tone of the received
signal.
There is no simple way to compare
SSB and AM. The amount of the
spectrum used by an SSB signal is
less than half that of an AM signal
modulated with the same audio sig-
nal. For this reason alone SSB would
be very desirable on today's crouded
bands. There is an even more desire-
able aspect of SSB than its band-
width and that is the power required
in the transmitter for equivalent re-
ception. The most straight forword
way to compare power requirements
is to determine the amount of power
required to produce an equivalent
signal-to-noise ratio at the receiver,
since it is the signal-to-noise ratio that
determines the intelligibility of the re-
ceived signal. Figure 6 shows a com-
parison between AM and SSB with
both modulated 100%. As shown be-
fore the sidebands in an AM signal
are each one half the voltage of the
carrier. Since the power is prepor-
tional to the square of the voltage,
each sideband will require one-fourth
the power of the carrier. Figure 6A
shows the power spectrum for an AM
transmitter rated at 1 unit of carrier
power. With 100% modulation such a
transmitter will actually produce 1.5
units of power. There is .25 unit of
power in each sideband and 1 unit
of power in the carrier. The AM
transmitter is compared with an SSB
transmitter rated at .5 unit of peak-
envelope-power (PEP). PEP is de-
fined as the rms power developed at
the peak of the modulation envelope.
The AM envelope will have a peak
envelope voltage (PEV) of 2 units
and thus a PEP of 4 units. When the
rf signal is demodulated in the AM
receiver an audio voltage developes
which is equivalent to the sum of the
upper and lower sideband voltages. In
this case 1 unit of voltage. When the

rf signal is demodulated in the SSB
receiver an audio voltage of .7 unit is
developed which is equal to the volt-
age of the single sideband that was
transmitted. This signal is developed
by hetrodyning the SSB signal down
to its original position in the audio
band. If a noise level of .1 unit of
voltage per unit bandwidth of the AM
signal is assumed it will equal .07 unit
of voltage for the SSB bandwidth.
These values represent the same noise
power per Kc. of bandwidth; that is,
.1V1 equals .072/i/2. With this chosen
noise level, the voltage signal-to-noise
ration which is defined in db as
201 og (s/n) is equal for the AM and
SSB. The AM signal-to-noise ratio
is 201og(l/l) = 20db and the SSB
signal-to-noise ratio is 20log (.7/.07)
20db. The i/2 power unit of rated
PEP power for the SSB transmitter
therefore produces the same intelli-
gibility as the 1 unit of rated AM car-
rier power. Since it is also true that
an amplifier operating at ]/% unit
peak power averages only 14 unit of
total power, an SSB system requires
tubes capable of only 14 the power of
an equivalent AM system. For these
reasons SSB is used today for almost
all commercial communications.
In Frequency Modulation the au-
dio signal is used to vary the fre-
quency of the carrier while keeping
its amplitude constant. The ampli-
tude of the audio controls the fre-
quency excursion of the carrier and
the frequency of the audio controls

the rate of these frequency excursions.
Figure 8 is a representation of a fre-
quency modulated signal. When a
modulating signal is applied, the car-
rier frequency is increased during one
half-cycle of the modulating signal
and decreased during the half-cycle of
and decreased during the half-clcle of
opposite polarity. This is indicated in
the drawing by the fact that the rf
cycle occupies an amount of time pro-
portional to the amplitude of the
modulating voltage. The percentage
of modulation in FM has to be de-
fined differently than for AM. The
frequency deviations can be adjusted
to almost any value at the transmitter,
but the receiver's bandpass is normal-
ly a fixed quantity. Best use can be
made of the system as a whole if the
transmitter's frequency deviation is
adjusted to fill the receiver's band-
pass. Thus "100% modulation" is de-
fined as the condition when the trans-
mitted signal just fills the receiver's
bandpass. If the deviation is greater
than the bandpass, distortion takes
place. If the deviation is less than the

of the receiver's capabilities. It is ob-
vious therefore that some standard
bandpass must be used to allow one
receiver to pick up a number of sta-
tions. In the U.S.A. the Federal Com-
munications Commission has set ±
75 Kc. as the standard deviation for
commercial FM broadcasting.
If we consider the carrier, that is
the unmodulated FM frequency, to
be at a frequency F, then the equa-
tion of the carrier is
V, = sin wt,
where
w = 2ttT.
It we let the modulating waveform be
cos (at), where a = 2iri and f is the
modulating frequency, and AF be the
maximum frequency deviation, then
the instantaneous frequency is F + A
Fcos (at) and the corresponding angu-
lar velocity is w + Awcos (at). This
angular velocity is the rate of change
of the modulated frequency. There-
fore, the radian frequency of the mod-
ulated FM signal is the integral of the
Since A/a = AF/f, the equation of
the FM signal can be written
It=SI N [u*+f-F5| N (at)]
It should be noted that the amplitude
of the term that varies the carrier fre-
quency AF sin (at)/f, involves both the
maximum frequency deviation, AF,
and the modulating frequency, f.
Equation 6 can be solved by using
Bessel functions of the first kind. The
solution leads to the spectrum distri-
bution of an FM signal.

This equation is very important as
far as circuit design is concerned since
its numerical evaluation gives the re-
quired bandwidth the circuits must
handle. It shows that theoretically an
infinite number of sidebands of fre-
quencies F±f, F±2f, F±3f, etc. be-
sides a carrier frequency of F are pos-
sible. It is the ratio AF/f that deter-
mines the amplitude of the sidebands.
Solution of the Bessel coefficients
shows that for any given carrier and
modulation frequencies the sidebands
are of significant magnitude for at
least four pairs of sidebands. For low
modulation frequencies there may be
fifteen or more significant sideband
pairs.
The simplest device for generating
FM is the reactance modulator shown
in Figure 9. This is a vacuum tube
connected to the resonant circuit of
an rf oscillator in such a way as to act
as a variable inductance or capaci-
tance that changes the frequency of
the ocillator in proportion to the
amplitude of the applied audio volt-
age. The control grid of the modu-
lator tube, M, is connected across
the oscillator resonant circuit, CjL,,
through resistor R.! and blocking
capacitor C2. C8 represents the
input capacitance of the modula-
tor tube. The resistanue of R,
is made large compared to the react-
ance of C8, so the rf current through
R,C8 will be practically in phase with
the rf voltage appearing at the ter-
minals of the resonant circuit. How-
ever, the voltage across Cs will lag
the current by 90 degrees, the rf cur-
rent in the plate circuit of the modu-
lator will be in phase with the grid
voltage, and consequently is 90 de-
grees behind the current through C8
or 90 degrees behind the resonant cir-
cuit voltage. This lagging current is
drawn through the resonant circuit
giving die same effect as an added in-
ductance. The frequency is increased
in proportion to the amplitude of the
modulator plate current and thus the
audio voltage applied to the modula-
tor. The modulator is operated at a
low frequency for stability and the
modulated signal frequency is then
multiplied to the desired transmission
frequency.
FM has several advantages over AM
or SSB. Since the transmitted sig-
nal's amplitude does not change, the
receiver can be constructed to ignore
amplitude varying signals. Since most
interference is amplitude modulated,
an FM receiver can be constructed
with a very high signal-to-noise ratio.
Modulation systems for FM are sim-
ple and require practically no power
as compared to an AM modulator
which requires a great deal of power.
Since there is no change in amplitude
in FM, it can be amplified to any de-
sired power in a simple class C ampli-
fier. Commercial FM stations are able
to transmit very high quality signals
at high power and cover a large geo-
graphic area. They are not subject to
the noise and fading of AM stations.

MECHANICAL ENGINEERING
Engineering is a profession whose members do creative work which results in things and information which
people want and need. Mechanical engineering is that branch of the profession which deals with devices and
equipment whose design, manufacture, and operation are essentially mechanical in nature. Thus the mechanical
engineer is concerned with thermodynamics, fluid flow, and heat transfer since the design of many mechanical
devices is based on a thorough knowledge of these phenomena. He is also cconcerned with dynamics, stress
analysis, materials, and automatic control, since these considerations enter into the design of mechanical equip-
ment. A knowledge of the principles of design and manufacturing is also essential for the mechanical engineer
if he is to fulfill his professional responsibilities.
Thus mechanical engineering is a profession of considerable breadth and is essential to virtually every in-
dustry and phase of technology. Mechanical engineering education at the University of Michigan involves an
integrated program of study in basic science, engineering sciences, mathematics, professionally oriented courses,
and humanities. The laboratory instruction is closely integrated with the classroom, and is given in the various
research laboratories in mechanical engineering. Many of the students have additional opportunities to enrich
their education by participating in research work during their undergraduate and graduate studies.
The objective of the educational program is to provide the environment which will enable students to pre-
pare to lead industry and technology in an era of rapid development and advancement.

I have discussed petty cheating first because it is considerably more
obvious and common than gross cheating. However, gross cheating, which
I will consider next, is a much more serious problem and if undetected, is
more harmful and unfair to the cheater's fellow class-mates, than is petty
cheating.
Basically most people are moral individuals and generally they feel
no need or compulsion to cheat. However, sometimes extenuating circum-
stances "force" an individual to cheat on a bluebook, and it is interesting
to note what the Honor Code "Bible" instructs the student to do in case
cheating is observed.
1. Tap on your desk with your pencil until you have caught the
attention of the offender, then caution him to stop by word or
gesture.
2. If he persists in cheating, report the name of the offender to a
member of the Honor Council or to your instructor.
This first instruction really amuses me when I consider it as a remedy
in a cheating situation. For instance, I've just seen someone cheating on this
bluebook that I am taking, and immediately I begin beating furiously
away on my desk top with my pencil in an effort to attract the cheater's
attention. (I muse be careful in the process, however, because I may dam-
age my writing instrument and this may seriously hinder my chances of
completing the bluebook myself.) Nevertheless, after the class has become
thoroughly irritated with me for disturbing their concentration, I realize
that my first attempt has failed. The cheater, who is no dope, upon hearing
the tapping, quickly and stealthfully stashed the evidence and did not even
bother to look around. I am foiled, and the cheater is soon at it again.
What a foul fiend!
Well, the first instruction lacked a certain amount of effectiveness, so
I resort to the next weapon, instruction number two, and report the culprit
to the Council. The Council conducts their typically thorough investigation
of the matter, and since it is only my word against the cheater's in the
final analysis, the only result is that I end up looking fairly silly. Obviously,
I don't think that either of these two instructions are effective and I am
not even sure that many people are aware of them.
As I have said the Code was set up forty-eight years ago, and to me
it seems that it is forty-eight years obsolete. The booklet which introduces
the freshman to the Honor System should be a reality adequate booklet,
and not a fairy-tale booklet. It should come out directly and accept the ease
with which petty cheating can be performed, and then illustrate to the
student why he should not petty cheat, giving him realistic and moralistic
reasons, not just the latter. Next, the booklet ought to outline a more effi-
cient and less ridiculous method of preventing cheating in the bluebook
situation. A little realistic thinking would seem to be the answer here also.
The honor system is a privilege and we, as the students who are en-
trusted with its well being, should keep it up to date and effective. We should
be proud that the university considers us as mature individuals in allow-
ing us the responsibility of maintaining our own Honor Council and the
administration of our own Code. The way for us to demonstrate our worthi-
ness as recipients of this responsibility is to make sure that we care enough
about the system to protect it from time, and then to practice it.

Physical chemist. Currently working for the electronics industry. Salary by Kodak. Having a wonder-
ful time.
Photography has penetrated everything, often unrecognized behind its disguises. With photography as
a means of fabrication, the electronics business builds complex logic circuits smaller than the period at
the end of this sentence. Technique depends on liquids hardened by light. Electronics engineers, know-
ing little about photopolymerization, turn to Kodak engineers. Kodak engineers turn to Kodak physical
chemists for the photopolymers. Ergo, we pay physical chemists to work for the electronics industry.
Typical instance of the delightfully unpredictable matchmaking that goes on in a thoroughly diver-
sified outfit.
Some people, who will always prefer the scientist's way of life to any other, nevertheless derive a large
bang from working often with engineers. Some people who class themselves engineers feel it can be a
dull life without personal contacts with the sources of new knowledge. Kodak is a good place for these
people to meet.

campus yj„ interview with General'Electric's W. Scott
One of a series .

Q. Mr. Hill, I've heard that my first
five years in industry may be the most
critical of my career. Do you agree?
A. Definitely. It is during this stage
that you'll be sharpening your career
objectives, broadening your knowledge
and experience, finding your place in
professional practice and developing
work and study habits that you may
follow throughout your career. It's a
period fraught with challenge and op-
portunity—and possible pitfalls.
Recognizing the importance of this
period, the Engineers' Council for Pro-
fessional Development has published
an excellent kit of material for young
engineers. It is titled "Your First 5
Years." I would strongly recommend
you obtain a copy.*
Q. What can I do to make best use
of these important years?
A. First of all, be sure that the com-
pany you join provides ample opportun-
ity for professional development during
this critical phase of your career.
Then, develop a planned, organized
personal development program—tai-
lored to your own strengths, weaknesses
and aspirations—to make the most of
these opportunities. This, of course,
calls for a critical self appraisal, and
periodic reappraisals. You will find an
extremely useful guide for this pur-
pose in the "First 5 Years" kit I just
mentioned.
Q. How does General Electric en-
courage self development during this
period?
A. In many ways. Because we recog-
nize professional self-development as a
never-ending process, we encourage
technical employees to continue their
education not only during their early
years but throughout their careers.
We do this through a variety of pro-
grams and incentives. General Electric's
Tuition Refund Program, for example,
provides up to 100% reimbursement for
tuition and fees incurred for graduate
study. Another enables the selected
graduate with proper qualifications to
obtain a master's degree, tuition free,
while earning up to 75% of his full-
time salary. These programs are sup-
Manager—Engineering Recruiting
How to Make the Most
ot Your First Five Years
MR. HILL has managerial responsibility for General Electric's college recruiting activities
for engineers, scientists, PhD's and technicians for the engineering function of the
Company. Long active in technical personnel development within General Electric, he
also serves as vice president of the Engineers' Council for Professional Development,
board member of the Engineering Manpower Commission, director of the Engineering
Societies Personnel Service and as an officer or member of a voriety of technical societies.
plemented by a wide range of techni-
cal and nontechnical in-plant courses
conducted at the graduate level by
recognized Company experts.
Frequent personal appraisals and en-
couragement for participation in pro-
fessional societies are still other ways
in which G.E. assists professional em-
ployees to develop their full potential.
Q. What about training programs?
Just how valuable are they to the
young engineer?
A. Quite valuable, generally. But there
are exceptions. Many seniors and grad-
uate students, for example, already have
clearly defined career goals and profes-
sional interests and demonstrated abili-
ties in a specific field. In such cases,
direct placement in a specific position
may be the better alternative.
Training programs, on the other
hand, provide the opportunity to gain
valuable on-the-job experience in sev-
eral fields while broadening your base
of knowledge through related course
study. This kind of training enables
you to bring your career objectives in-
to sharp focus and provides a solid
foundation for your development, wheth-
er your interests tend toward speciali-
zation or management. This is par-
ticularly true in a highly diversified
company like General Electric where
young technical graduates are exposed
to many facets of engineering and to
a variety of product areas.
Q. What types of training programs
does your company offer, Mr. Hill?
A. General Electric conducts a num-
ber of them. Those attracting the ma-
jority of technical graduates are the
Engineering and Science, Technical
Marketing and Manufacturing Train-
ing Programs. Each includes on-the-job
experience on full-time rotating assign-
ments supplemented by a formal study
curriculum.
Q. You mentioned professional so-
cieties. Do you feel there is any ad-
vantage in joining early in your career?
A. I do indeed. In fact, I would rec-
ommend you join a student chapter on
your campus now if you haven't already
done so.
Professional societies offer the young
engineer many opportunities to expand
his fund of knowledge through associa-
tion with leaders in his profession,
to gain recognition in his field, and to
make a real contribution to his profes-
sion. Because General Electric benefits
directly, the Company often helps de-
fray expenses incurred by professional
employees engaged in the activities of
these organizations.
Q. Is there anything I can do now to
better prepare myself for the transition
from college campus to industry?
A. There are many things, naturally,
most of which you are already doing
in the course of your education.
But there is one important area you
may be overlooking. I would suggest
you recognize now that your job—
whatever it is—is going to be made
easier by the ability to communicate
. . . effectively. Learn to sell yourself
and your ideas. Our own experience at
General Electric—and industry-wide sur-
veys as well—indicates that the lack
of this ability can be one of the major
shortcomings of young technical grad-
uates.

lished by the FMgineers' Council for
Professional Development, normally
sells for $2.00. While our limited sup-

TO THE GRADUATING SENIOR
Another semester seems to have flown past, and for
many graduating seniors, the end of the past semester
represents the termination of their academic careers. This
memo is directed to you, the members of the June, 1963
graduating class of the college of engineering.
At the present time, thoughts of industry are probably
most prominent in your mind (assuming that you are the
type who does not get too worried about your last semes-
ter's finals.) By now, you have your new job selected, and
you consider it a good job; so you are excited about gradu-
ating. Also you have acquired a good understanding of the
engineering fundamentals in which you have been instruct-
ed here at the university, and as a result, you feel confident
that you will be able to cope with the demands of your new
job; so you are excited about graduating. Finally, you are
proud to consider yourself a graduate of an engineering
college as respected as Michigan's; so you are excited about
graduating.
Your graduation from college is an exciting event and a
milestone in your life. But as you "make ready" to disembark
from this institution, which represents the culmination of
sixteen or seventeen years of schooling, consider for just a
moment what you are leaving.
In the primary grades, you probably detested school like
most youngsters, with the exception of recess. However, as
you grew older, both chronologically and educationally, you
discovered that education (and by that I mean school)
really wasn't so bad. In fact, every now and then you en-
countered something new — something which interested
you—and you gradually came to enjoy learning.
Finally you graduated from high school and prepared to
enter college to study engineering. This particular decision
represents two desires on your part; you desired to learn
more about the many things which you then only had an
inkling about, and you desired to eventually enter the
engineering profession.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Now you've made it! You've learned all of those "things
you knew nothing about" and you're ready to enter your
chosen profession, and perhaps (hopefully not) ready to
leave your interest and enthusiasm about science and engi-
neering behind in the dust of your exit.
For many years, you've been forced to study and you've
been forced to discover what your interests are and where
they lie. Soon that force will no longer be present; you will
be free at long last. However, in retrospect, you can see that
all of this forcing has made you what you are and what you
want to be.
What's going to happen when the force, formerly placed
upon you to study, has been lifted? Will you become intel-
lectually inactive for the rest of your life by considering your
education at an end? If you feel this way, you are essentially
depositing your learning in the trash can as you leave.
On the other hand, if college has made you aware of the
many deficiencies in your education, your motivation to
erase these deficiencies can serve as the force to encourage
your studying and learning. Or if your engineering studies
have taught you that new developments in engineering are
always being made and that it is your job, as an engineer,
to keep abreast of these developments, you can discipline
yourself to keep informed and thus continue your education.
You will find that the world has made it easy for you to
pursue your post-graduation education. Various groups have
formed societies which discuss topics of current interest in
specific areas of engineering, and they even publish papers
for you to read, in case you cannot attend some of the
discussions. There are also many magazines (feebly attemp-
ting to compete with the Technic) which are excellent
sources of engineering and scientific information. It is a
simple matter to subscribe to these publications, and, assum-
ing that you will read them, keep yourself informed.
So, as you prepare to graduate, ask yourself what kind
of an engineer you want to be ten or twenty years from now.
And if you decide that you would like to be a good engi-
neer—a man who brings credit to his profession—then, now
is the time for you to set your post-graduate educational
plans and goals.
The world awaits you . . . go!

going our way?
It's a direction you should definitely consider when charting
the course of your career.
As the pioneer and leading manufacturer of VTOL (vertical
take-off and landing) aircraft, we know that many young
engineers have found "going our way" to be a challenging and
exciting route to career goals.
Here, at Sikorsky Aircraft, alert, well-trained engineering minds
will enjoy the individual recognition and personal growth
opportunities which go hand in hand with the startling advances
of a new technology. The modern Sikorsky vehicle is a VTOL
system which embodies the merging of sophisticated electronic
systems with the VTOL airframe ... to create the world's most
versatile means of transportation.
And the reach of the exciting future ahead for VTOL systems
can at best only be suggested by such current usages as: space
capsule recovery • anti-submarine systems • equipment and
personnel transport • airport passenger travel • industrial
transport and personal transportation.
Supporting these activities is an excellent engineering environ-
ment . . . providing for free and active interchange of ideas
between small, compact, interdependent groups. Assignments
are diversified and stimulating—with electronic teams or groups
working on demanding problems in such areas as aerodynam-
ics * human factors engineering • automatic controls
• stress engineering • weight prediction • systems anal-
ysis • operations research • reliability/maintainabil-
ity engineering • autonavigatlon systems... among others.
GRADUATE STUDY OPPORTUNITIES: In addition to
an attractive professional environment, Sikorsky Aircraft offers
engineers the opportunity to earn advanced degrees through a
corporation-financed Graduate Education Program. These pro-
grams are available at such accredited schools as Yale Univer-
sity, New York University, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute
(Hartford Graduate Center), and Columbia University.

dramatically smoother ride
in 1963 Ford-built cars
The challenge given Ford engineers was to design suspensions
that would permit wheels virtually to roll with the punches—not
only in a vertical plane but fore-and-aft as well. Conventional
suspension systems provide only a partial solution to road shocks
by limiting wheel recoil to an up-and-down motion.
The solution? Exclusive Cushion Recoil suspension design in all
Ford-built cars for '63! Cushion Recoil, with cushioning action
in a fore-and-aft plane as well as vertical, smothers the jars and
jolts of rough roads, adds to your comfort, safety, and driving
pleasure. Even the thump of freeway tar strips is reduced, and
on deeply rutted roads you experience better control of the car.
Furthermore, your Ford-built car is spared the wear and tear of
road-induced vibration.
Another assignment completed—one more example of engineer-
ing excellence at Ford and new ideas for the American Road.

STYLING
by Curt Fischbach
When beginning to talk of the
automobile industry, which directly
and indirectly is responsible for em-
ploying one third of the nation's
working force, it must be remem-
bered that the companies producing
automobiles are doing so for one,
and only one, reason. That rea-
son is simply to make money. To
make money, they must sell cars. To
sell cars, they must appeal to the pros-
pective purchasers, and this is where
good looks, or more properly, styling,
plays its important role.
Styling departments at the auto-
makers set the trends for the industry.
It is easy to recall the trend of the
mid and late fifties to longer, lower
and wider cars. The stylists went wild
bringing about some of the sleekest,
most pregressive designs yet to be pre-
sented to the public. Chrysler Corp-
oration even adopted a company slo-
gan, "the cars of the forward look,"
which was entirely based on their new
radical styling. Then came the com-
pacts, the "little brother" group of
cars aimed at economy; but again,
styling played an important keynote.
To make these cars completely accep-
table, they had to appear satisfactory
to both the eyes of the owner, and to
the eyes of his neighbor across the
fence. Currently, many of the stylists
are slimming that "excessive size"
look from the popular selling models.
An automobile's styling consists of
two general areas, exterior and inter-
ior. Exterior styling must be function-
ally correct, as well as having good eye
appeal. Stylists, working with body
engineers, will attempt to complete a
body design which will offer as little
wind resistance as possible, a mini-
mum of wind whistle around the pas-
senger area, and have adequate wheel
clearance for the front wheels to turn
through. They must be careful to
allow sufficient engine compartment
room for the large power plants
offered by today's automakers.
Excellent exterior eye appeal, that
quality which most probably has more
to do with the public acceptance of
the car than any other factor, is
what the stylist must strive for after
all the aforementioned conditions
are met. Experimental show cars are
built simply to see how the public
will react to new styling ideas. Those
features that provoke favorable com-
ments are usually incorporated into
following years' designs. Cadillac's
"Cyclone," Ford's "Atmos" and Chry-
sler's European built show cars have

The electron bombardment ion thruster was conceived and developed by Harold R. Kaufman, a research scientist at NASA
—Lewis Research Center. It uses mercury as a propellant, weighs 4 pounds and is 8 inchs in diameter, with an efficiency
as high as 80 per cent. This is the best ion thruster in the United States today.

by Martin Tanenhaus
In the exploration of deep space,
propulsion, the means of getting
there, has always been a crucial prob-
lem. Today's chemical propulsion sys-
tems have inherent limitations. En-
gines must be capable of operation,
not for days or weeks, but for months
and even years. All the fuel must be
carried aloft from launch. Once free
from the earth's atmosphere, however,
it doesn't take much power at any
given moment to move a spacecraft.
Therefore, the extent of space explor-
ation in the future will depend pri-
marily upon the sizes and efficiencies
of propulsion systems which will be
developed.
Scientists are looking at many types
of engines that seem especially adopt-
ed to propel a space ship on inter-
plantary missions. Such propulsion
plants would go into action after the
vehicle was clear of the earth's gravi-
tational field. These systems include:
(1) Electrothermal or arc-jet.
(2) Electrostatic or ion and colloid
(3) Electromagnetic or plasma.
The research men are presently
pursuing a wide range of ingenious
approaches.
(1) Development of permanent
magnets for ion engines.
(2) Clustering concepts to increase
thrust.
(3) Low-temperature magnetohy-
drolynamic generators (MHD)
through the "Kerrbrock Effect."
(4) Colloids and heavy paricle
concepts.
Electrothermal
Thrust is produced by heating gas-
eous propellant with an electric arc.
The propellant, at several thousand
degrees F, is expanded through a con-
ventional nozzle. Specific impulses
will be 700-2000 seconds and thrust
in operational engines will be be-
tween .01 and 1.0 pounds. Although
low in I,p, the arc-jet is the simplest
device capable of generating high
thrust from a given amount of power.
This capability is caused by its low
power and energy transfer loses.
The major advantage of electro-
thermal engines is their operation
over a wide range of thrusts or specific
impulses. For example, an engine is
designed to give 1 pound of thrust at
1000 seconds.If an emergency occurred
and 2 pounds were needed, twice as
much propellant could be run
through, letting the specific impulse
drop to 500 seconds. In fact, an arc-
jet engine could be run clear down to
the specific impulse range of chemical
rockets. This flexibility also provides
a good thrust margin for maneuvering
and for acceleration. For maneuver-
ing, the electrothermal engine has the
further advantage of essentially insta-
taneous on-off operation like a com-
mon light switch.
In orbital operations, electrother-
mal designs look promising for drag
make-up or lowr-altitude satellites. If
a given orbit must be maintained in
the atmosphere, an arc jet could be
turned on from time to time to take
the satellite to a slightly higher alti-
tude from which the orbit could de-
cay to the desired one. Another early
application might involve the raising
of a stationary communications satel-
lite from an inclined orbit to a syn-
chronous equatorial orbit at 23,300
miles altitude.
Whether electrothermal or electro-
statics propulsion is better for a given
station-keeping function depends on
the vehicle, the time in orbit, the dis-
turbances that might occur, and the
presence or absence of electric pri-
mary propulsion.
Currently, a 30 kw tungsten tube
resistance-heated hydrogen rocket is
designed for a thrust of 1.0 pounds
and a Igp of 1000 seconds. Its princi-
ple of operation is based on an elec-
trically powered, resistance-heated
heat exchanger to bring the propel-
lant to the temperature required to
produce the desired engine perform-
ance. Some potential features include:
(1) High efficiency
(2) Long life
(3) Simple matching to a power
supply (AC or DC current)
(4) Simple starting technique
(5) Variable thrust
Important problem areas are (1)
the choice of a suitable propellant to
increase the efficiency and meet the
space storage requirements, (2) lim-
ited temperatures and I„p because of
the required metal heat exchanger,
and (3) the development of better re-
generation and radiation cooling tech-
niques.
Electrostatic
For many missions, ion engines ap-
pear to be essential, particularly when
it comes to deep space research. There
are two methods to produce a beam
of ionized particles; surface ionization
and volume ionization.
Surface ionization is based on the
fact that, when a metal of low work
function is evaporated from an alkali
MAY 1963

Rocket vehicles, such as the conceptual design shown here, will be used in deep
space missions to Mars or Venus and beyond. The variable thrust and reliable
shutoff and re-ignition of electric rockets make them ideal for extended manned
flight.
metal of high work function, an elec-
tron is stripped from each atom of
the evaporing metal, so that it is actu-
ally positive ions that evaporate. For
example, cesium is vaporized and
impinged on a heated tungsten emit-
ter. Positive cesium ions are generated,
then accelerated through electrostatic
fields, and ejected, providing thrust.
The specific impulses range between
3500 and 10,000 seconds with thrusts
ranging between .01 and .5 pounds.
In volume ionization, ions are gen-
erated volumetrically by electron
bombardment of atoms. Several meth-
ods have been developed. The elec-
tron bombardment technique by H.
R. Kaufman of NASA uses weak mag-
netic fields and a small potential dif-
ference to generate ions, which then
are accelerated by other fields. The
modified Penning discharge developed
by R. J. Meyerand Jr. of United Air-
craft uses strong electric and magnetic
fields in combination with internal
electric accelerating fields.
Recently, engineers at NASA's Lew-
is Research Center have redesigned
an electric bombardment ion engine
to utilize permanent magnet circuits
rather than solenoid coils.
The use of mechanically strong
permanent magnets in space (lights
will enhance the simplicity and relia-
bility of the thrustor system and will
increase the already high efficiency of
mercury ion engines by about 3 per
cent. Other advantages include:
(1) Elimination of loss of energy
that occurs in the solenoid coil
thrustors.
(2) Substantial reduction of the
field external to the thrustor,
since the permanent magnets
serve as a return path for the
magnetic flux lines.
(3) Ability to arrange the rocket
engines in clusters without con-
cern of field intermixing as in
the solenoid coil magnets.
(4) Elinination of the problems of
comprising between weight and
power of magnetic fields. It
eliminates the weight of the
power supply and controls re-
quired by the field windings.
Part of the weight savings re-
sults from the incorporation of
the permanent magnet circuits
into the thrustor structure,
which trades magnet weight for
distributor and screen material.
The permanent magnet system does
involve loss of a degree of flexibility
for general thrustor research because
once they are assembled the magnet
field is constant. Although the weight
savings are only about 2 per cent of
the power supply this could be sub-
stantial in space vehicles with 1,000,-
000 pound power systems.
Another electrostatic engine offer-
ing distinct promise for high efficiency
in the low-specific-impulse region is
the heavy particle system or colloid
rocket. Though still in the early de-
velopment stages, it may perform as
well in its own region as the electron
bombardment engine does at high
specific impulses. The method uses
molecular ions, charged colloids, or
charged spray or dust particles as
propellants, and also engines which
accelerate conducting particles by
magnetic fields. It is important be-
cause it permits greater mass flow per
unit motor area, and hence, a smaller
motor size than ion systems with the
same exhaust velocity and the same
power-to-thrust ratio.
The colloid engine uses particles of
100,000 atomic mass units or more,
but difficulties have been found in
producing, charging, and accelerating
such particles. One frequent problem
is the production of atomic or mole-
cular ions, which consume much more
power than their thrust is worth at
the high accelerating voltages. Stor-
age and propellant feedings are also
problems when particles are prefabri-
cated.
A varying magnetic field can be
applied to accelerate conducting par-
ticles. If the particles are made super-
conducting, exhaust velocities and effi-
ciencies of practical significance ap-
pear theoretically possible.
An important problem common to
all ion sources is "neutral efflux."
Along with ions, a certain number of
neutral atoms is always produced.
Ions can hit and transfer their
charges to these atoms, and these in
turn may be accelerated into the elec-
trodes, causing these to erode and
thereby destroy thrust.
Electromagnetic
An accelerating plasma is a gaseous
mixture dissociated and ionized into
approximately equal amounts of elec-
trons and positively charged ions. Al-
though neutral the gas responds to
electrical and magnetic fields. Acceler-
ation means applying mutually per-
pendicular magnetic and electric
fields. This brings the synchronous

SALUTE: TOM HAMILTON
When the Bell System recently product-tested the new
Touch Tone telephone in Findlay, Ohio, they called on
Ohio Bell's Tom Hamilton (B.S.E.E., 1960) to coordinate
the project. Quite an honor since this was one of two
Touch Tone trial areas in the entire country.
This happened on Tom's second assignment with the
company. Since completing the project, Tom has joined
the Fundamental Planning Engineer's Group. Here he

makes engineering economy studies and submits programs
for capital expenditures. Tom's performance has earned
him the opportunity to attend a special six-month Bell
System engineering course in Denver.
Tom Hamilton and other young engineers like him in

from 135 to 400 miles above the earth. The satellite is
a 35-inch diameter spherical stainless steel shell contain-

composition, pressure, and temperature of the upper
atmosphere. Because any gas leaking from the satellite
into the vacuum of space would contaminate the space

Commission for construction of a mobile Military Compact Reactor highlights
the progress Allison is making in energy conversion programs.
Objective of the high priority project is the design, construction and operation of
an extremely mobile, lightweight powerplant capable of generating 3000 kw. of
electricity. The plant will have a high temperature, liquid metal-cooled reactor
coupled to a power conversion system. In addition to its military field use, the
MCR could serve as a power source in civilian defense and power failure
emergencies. Allison, the energy conversion Division of General Motors, was
selected by the AEC as prime contractor on the basis of company capability to
act as systems manager for the complete project.
In other fields, first and second stage rocket motor cases designed and produced
by Allison for Minuteman have achieved a 100 per cent reliability record. Too,
Allison research has made significant progress in the development of cases from
lighter weight materials, titanium and plastics, and now is in position to meet the
case needs of the future . . . whatever they may be.
Allison also maintains its position as foremost designer, developer and producer
of turboprops. Current emphasis is directed toward developing engines of greater

EDUCATION AND RESEARCH
by Karl Legatski
Bubble Chamber
The University of Michigan is
building the world's biggest "heavy
liquid" bubble chamber for the study
of atomic particles. Construction of
the chamber, at the Willow Run Lab-
oratories by University of Michigan
physicists, will mark a significant step
forward in the de%'elopment of the
device invented at Michigan in 1952
by Professor Donald Glaser who sub-
sequently won the Nobel Prize in
physics for his accomplishment.
The entire device, which will per-
mit the study of swiftly moving, par-
ticles by the bubble trails they leave
in passing through a liquid, will be
45 feet long and 16 feet high, with
most of the si/.e consisting of a 300-
ton magnet surrounding the chamber
itself which will be -40 inches in diam-
eter and 26 inches deep. This will
make the new chamber about twice
the size of other similar bubble cham-
bers in the United States and slightly
larger than one other in Europe.
When construction is completed
next year, the chamber will be moved
to Argonne National Laboratory near
Chicago and used in conjunction with
the atomic accelerator there. The Uni-
versity will conduct two experiments
a year with the chamber at Argonne,
each taking some four weeks of round-
the-clock operation. Photographs will
be taken every four seconds while the
experiment is going on. It takes al-
most a year to analyze the 100 to 200
thousand photographs that will be
taken during an experiment. When
the University of Michigan is not us-
ing the facility, other universities will
have access to the chamber.
At Argonne, the accelerator will be
used to accelerate protons to tremen-
dous speeds, which will produce sec-
ondary particles when they are made
to strike a target. These particles will
then pass through the bubble cham-
ber, creating little paths of bubbles.
The chamber is surrounded by a mag-
netic field which will turn the par-
ticles according to their charge and
aid in identifying them. All of this
will be photographed through a ten
inch thick optical glass window.
The chamber will contain freon,
propane, or both. The Michigan
phsycists expect to conduct some ex-
periments in which a liquid hydrogen
target will be contained in the liquid
freon. The particles will interact with
the hydrogen and will be studied by
the bubbles they create in the freon.
Cyclotron
The University of Michigan is
unique in that it has two cyclotrons
devoted exclusively to the study of the
structure of the nuclei of the atom.
One is a 50-inch and the other is an
83-inch machine.
The 50-inch machine was an old
42--inch one in Randall Laboratory.
This machine, which was the first one
built outside the state of California,
has been remodeled and moved to
North Campus.
The new 83-inch machine is the on-
ly cyclotron that has adequate means
for studying the nuclei of the heavier
elements, such as lead, gold, radium,
and uranium. The "83-inch" size, by
which cyclotrons arc measured, refers
to the diameter of the tips of the poles
of the huge magnet (which weighs
310 tons in the new machine) that is
essential to the cyclotrons operation.
To illustrate how a cyclotron
works, let us follow one particle on its
trip through The University of Mich-
igan 83-inch variable-energy cyclotron.
On one side of the enormous steel
yoke which supports the cyclotron's
magnet there are three small tanks for
hydrogen, deuterium (heavy hydro-
gen), and helium. Let us suppose diat
deuterons from deuterium are wanted
as the nuclear projectiles. Deuterium
gas is led through a small pipe into
the vacuum chamber, which sits be-
tween the poles of the magnet. The
end of the pipe makes a right angle,
so that a short section, called the arc
tower, projects into the center of the
vacuum chamber. Below the tower is a
tungsten filament, electrically heated.
As the deuterium passes over the hot
filament it is ioni/ed and a deuterium
arc discharge is formed. The positively
charged deuteron (one proton and
one neutron) is drawn out of the
tower through a small slit by the ac-
tion of the electric field.

the cyclotron, emerges into the space
between two flat, hollow, D-shaped
objects, called "dees." The dees for
the 83-inch cyclotron are about one
and a half inches thick and more than
five feet long on the open straight
side. The curved side is closed. The
dees are part of an electric circuit
which oscillates in the radio-frequency
range. The oscillator that supplies
power to the dee circuit changes the
voltage of dees back and forth from
+ 70,000 to -70,000 volts up to 15,-
000,000 times a second. Above and
below the dees are the magnet poles,
which provide a strong magnetic field
perpendicular to the dees.
By virtue of the rapidly oscillating
electrical voltage given each dee by
the radio-frequency system, the posi-
tively charged deuteron, as it is drawn
into the negatively charged dee, gains
energy and thereby increases its veloc-
ity. The combination of the velocity
of the deuteron and the strong mag-
netic field perpendicular to its veloc-
ity causes the deuteron to swing
through the dee in a tight semicircle.
When the deuteron completes its trip
through one dee and enters the free
space between the dees, the other dee
must be given a negative potential so
that it will pull the deuteron into
itself and increase the deuteron's speed
still further. The rate at which the
dees change from positive to negative
voltage must be precisely timed to
coincide with the time the deuteron
takes to move throug the dee. The
deuteron circles around from dee to
dee, the length of its circular path
steadily increasing as its velocity in-
creases, yet the time required for each
movement through a dee is always
the same, at least in small cyclotrons.
In the large, 83-inch cyclotron, how-
ever, the velocity of the particles is so
great (approximately one-fifth that of
light) that the mass of the particles,
according to Einstein's principle, in-
creases enough to alter the time re-
quired for the particle to make a cor-
cle through the dees. Were the in-
crease in mass and variance in time
allowed to go unchecked, a beam of
particles would not emerge. To adjust
for this, either the radio-frequency
system can be modulated or the mag-
netic field can be adjusted. In the 83-
inch cyclotron the latter alternative is
used. Gradient coils and spiral shims
are fastened to the pole tips. The gra-
dient coils shape the magnetic field in
such a way that the time for the par-

Looking into the vacuum chamber of the cyclotron, scheduled to begin research next year, are: Dr. David Dennison, physics
department chairman; Rep. George Meader of Ann Arbor, who was instrumental in obtaining the AEC project; Dr. William
C. Parkinson, cyclotron laboratory director; and Dr. Ralph A sawyer (standing), U. of M Vice-President for research.
tide's trip through the dees remains
the same regardless of its velocity. The
shims keep the particles from hitting
the top or the bottom of the dees.
After the rapidly moving particle
reaches the maximum radius within
the dees it shoots out a gap in the
outside rim of the dee and out of the
vacuum chamber into a duct. It is
somewhat unrealistic, of course, to
speak of just one deuteron in this
process, for actually there are a great
many deuterons being whirled around
inside the dees in pie-shaped wedges.
What emerges from the machine is a
stream of particles—and this is what
physicists were trying to obtain after
Rutherford's initial discovery — that
can be focused, like light, onto a tar-
get.
The beam of deuterons that emerg-
es from the cyclotron is not quite
ready to use. First it must enter the
beam-preparation system, which con-
sists of two 36-ton rectangular steel
and copper magnets, curved to focus
the beam much as a glass lens focuses
light. While the beam is being fo-
cused, the particles that are too slow
or too fast are weeded out. Now at
last, with a narrowly focused (one
centimeter by one millimeter) beam
of particles, all moving at very nearly
the same speed (to within one part in
20,000), the physicist has what he
wants.
The beam now enters the scattering
chamber and strikes the material un-
der study. If, say, the energy levels in
one of the isotopes of iron are under
study, a thin film of iron, about one
micron thick, is evaporated onto a
backing material (gold or carbon) anil
placed in the scattering chamber. The
iron makes a dark spot about a centi-
meter square on the backing material,
and it is to this tiny square that all
the action of the cyclotron is directed.
A deuteron strikes the nucleus of an
atom, knocks a proton out of the nu-
cleus, and then sticks in the nucleus.
This is the celebrated "atom-smash-
ing" associated with cyclotrons. The
protons that have been knocked out
of the iron nuclei pass through a sys-
tem of three 30-ton steel and copper
analyzing magnets to a proton detec-
tor. One kind of proton detector is a
nuclear emulsion plate, which, when
developed, shows thin grey trails left
by the protons. By counting and anal-
yzing these trails, the nuclear physi-
cists working in the Cyclotron Lab-
oratory can continue contributing to
our basic knowledge of the structure
of the nucleus. The accuracy of the
beam-preparation and analysis system
of the 83-inch cyclotron is unsur-
passed.

all had parts of their designs included
in the production models on the road
now.
Interior styling, sometimes forgot-
ten by some, is almost equally impor-
tant. The seats must be formed so that
they blend with the car's decor, as
well as be comfortable to the passen-
gers. The headroom allowed the pas-
sengers, both front and rear, must be
taken into consideration. This is one
place where interior styling and ex-
terior styling often conflict. Another
very important area of interior styl-
ing is the instrument panel and dash.
The functional importance to the
driver is clearly recognizable, but it
must be remembered that the placing
of dials and gauges so that they read
quickly and clearly can be extremely
difficult. Besides filling the driver con-
venience requirement, the instrument
panel gauges must not glare at night,
nor reflect off the windshield. In ad-
dition, the safety conscious public is
now seriously interested in how dash
panels will injure a car's occupants in
the event of a sudden stop or acci-
dent. One automobile recently intro-
duced, the Studebaker Avanti, has all
controls either recessed, or removed
from the dash panel area. Most cars
now offer as optional equipment pad-
ded dash panels and sun visors. Stu-
debaker even went so far as to pad
the lower edge of the dash to protect
the knees of the passengers. All of the
safety refinements have had to be de-
signed into the dash panels by the
stylists in an attractive package.
Projecting into the future can de-
termine what styling may offer. The
rocket and airplane have been seen to
drastically influence the mode of styl-
ing in recent years. As long as the
country and the buyers are space
minded, styling can be expected to
continue to be influenced by those
shapes related to space travel. Engi-
neering needs and changes will alter
exterior styling. One example is that
of wheel openings. With an increased
need for air circulation around wheels
to aid in cooling the brakes, exterior
styling can be expected to be shaped
to allow a larger passage of air in that
area. The wheel openings will remain
large, and greater attention will be
paid to the channeling of air to the
brakes by virtue of the contours of
the body. Doors rounding into the
roof will probably catch on since they
appear to be desired by the buyers
and can be played with by the design-
ers.
Consequently it can be seen that
the public can dictate to a very large
degree what it gets in the way of au-
tomobile styling. Its biggest reaction
is expressed in the sales figures of the
cars, but if enough comments are
made, the general feeling is quickly
relayed to the stylists and they in
turn will, with equal swiftness, modi-
fy the designs on the drawing boards
to conform with the public wants. So,
speak up, for public opinion holds the
real key to automobile styling!

The forged steel cylinder cap shown at top is used on
the rod end of a Nike missile launcher cylinder. tifta
Before the changeover to forgings, cylinder caps
were a source of problems. Tool breakage and tool
wear were excessive because the cored castings
lacked concentricity, were contaminated with non-
metallic inclusions. When the caps, after costly
machining, were hydrostatically tested at 4,500 psi,
porosity of the castings often resulted in leakers.
The switch to forgings produced these Bk ^-
cost-cutting results: \3H
40% reduction in initial cost when forgings
replaced castings.
20% increase in tool life.
12% increase in production — unscheduled tool
replacement eliminated.
6% rejection rate caused by porosity
reduced to zero.
10% reduction in weight with increased strength.
As you take your place in today's high-speed world,
where progress is paced by imaginative engineering,
it will pay you to ask, "What about forgings?" for
many of the things you will develop, design, engineer,

SIMPLIFIED DIAGRAM OF ION ROCKET
ELECTRIC GENERATOR

The first ion rocket thrustor was successfully operated at NASA's Lewis Research
Center in June, 1959. Its propellant was cesium vapor which was ionized by con-
tact with hot (2000 degrees Fahrenheit) wolfram surfaces and accelerated with
voltages up to 30,000 volts.
motor principle into effect; that is,
when a conductor is acted upon by
mutually perpendicular magnetic and
electric fields, it moves. The potential
Isp range is between 700 and 10,000
seconds with thrusts ranging between
.01 and 1.0 pounds.
A major problem is the lack of
fundamental knowledge in plasma
physics and an equal lack of sufficient
plasma diagnostic techniques to ade-
quately evaluate the experiments be-
ing performed. A potential high effi-
ciency in the 1000 to 5000 second I8p
range is due to the possibility of effi-
cient utilization of the plasma's ions,
since in such devices the ionization
and acceleration processes can be in-
tegral, the ions being accelerated as
produced.
At NASA's Lewis Labs, a program
is investigating the feasibility of ap-
plying the "Kerrebrock Effect" to
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) pow-
erplant schemes. The "Effect" is
named after the work on the phenom-
enon performed by Dr. J. Kerrebrock
at the California Institute of Tech-
nology. Basically, the procedure makes
use of magnetic field already present
in an MHD device to produce elec-
trons without the need for very high
temperature. When an electric cur-
rent Hows in a gas, the few already
present electrons reach higher temper-
atures than the gas itself. By adjust-
ing the gas composition and the mag-
netic field, elections can be made hot
enough to create ionization of a suit-
able additive gas without providing
heat from an external source.
While there is a considerable re-
duction in the operating temperature
input, the regime is still in the 2500°
F area and this will require some ma-
terials development if the process
proves promising.
In all plasma engines, electromag-
netic forces act upon electrons and
ions. Collision frequencies between
charged particles and neutral atoms
are so high that ions, atoms, and elec-
trons assume the same average stream-
ing velocity. The thrust densities of
plasma engines may become fairly
high, as contrasted to the thrust den-
sities of ion engines, which will al-
ways remain low. But this advantage
will make plasma systems superior to
ion systems only when plasma engines
have reached a state of development
where their total efficiencies are com-
parable to those of ion engines. This
is not yet the case. The highest effi-
ciency reported to date for a plasma
engine is 5-1%. As a rule, total effi-
ciencies of plasma systems (including
power required to produce initial
plasma jet in an arc chamber) are
still below 30 to 40 per cent.
Also, the lifetime of all plasma en-
gines are still short, not only because
of sputtering and erosion of chamber
and nozzle walls, but also because of
limited endurance of switches, con-
dense! s, and other circuit elements
needed.
Conclusion
The great importance of early
Might testing of engine models under
true space conditions was recognized
several years ago. Flight tests will be
necessary to demonstrate the proper
functioning of systems under zero-g,
in extreme vacuum, and in limitless
space. These evaluations will serve to
refine engineering and systems design,
to obtain optimum solutions, and to
assure reliability of all components.
Such tests will be necessary as a nat-
ural, logical step in the evolution of
a new technique to be used for space
missions.
In summary, electric propulsion has
now reached the state of engineering
refinement, reliability improvement,
space testing, and mission planning.
The first mission projects, based on
small nuclear and solar power sup-
plies, should be planned for flights in
1964 or 1965. An impressive array of
talents and facilities for electric pro-
pulsion development exists in indus-
try, non-profit organizations, the Air
Force and NASA. With energetic and
determined leadership from the gov-
ernment, there is no doubt that elec-
tric propulsion will develop soon in-
to a most valuable component of our
national space program.

CIVIL ENGINEERING
Sanitary Engineering is one of the several areas of concentration within the field of Civil Engineering. San-
itary Engineering finds a very important place in the present and future of the engineering profession. With
our tremendous population growth we are experiencing an awakening realization of the vital importance of
water supply and water conservation in our national economy. Research going on in Sanitary Engineering pro-
vides the promise of adequate treatment of used waters and the adequate removal of pollutants to insure that
the purity of our water supplies is not impaired.
The illustrations above show some of this research. One is the development of algal cultures which have
potential in the removal of nutrients from used waters prior to their discharge into a receiving stream. In this
way the quality of the stream will not be unfavorably affected by the presence of these nutrient materials. The
other illustration is of the sedimentation of solid matter which is a very important part of treatment methods
and the improvement of settling characteristics by various additives is being studied.
Students and staff in Sanitary Engineering are working in close conjunction with local, state and federal
agencies in the various aspects of water pollution control and purification. The problems of water supply de-
velopment and transmission, waste water treatment and industrial waste treatment are a very important part
of the problems of the present and of the future.

Once upon a time there was a creature known to jokesmiths as "the efficiency expert." When he wasn't being
laughed at, he was being hated. Kodak felt sorry for the poor guy and hoped that in time he could be
developed into an honored, weight-pulling professional. That was long ago.
We were then and are much more today a very highly diversified manufacturer. We need mechanical, electri-
cal, chemical, electronic, optical, etc., etc. engineers to design equipment and processes and products for
our many kinds of plants, and make it all work. But all the inanimate objects they mastermind eventually
have to link up with people in some fashion or other—the people who work in the plants, the people who
manage the plants, and the people who buy the products. That's why we need "industrial engineers."
A Kodak industrial engineer learns mathematical model-building and Monte Carlo computer techniques. He
uses the photographic techniques that we urge upon other manufacturing companies. He collaborates with
medicos in physiological measurements, with architects, with sales executives, with manufacturing executives,
with his boss (G. H. Gustat, behind the desk above, one of the Fellows of the American Institute of Industrial
Engineers). He starts fast. Don Wagner (M.S.I.E., Northwestern '61) had 4 dissimilar projects going the day
the above picture was sneaked. He is not atypical. Want to be one?

trical engineering and began his

How Industry Tempers
Theory with Practice
to Get Good Design
Q. Mr. McCune, how do you define engineering design?
A. First let's look at what engineering really is. The National Society of Profes-
sional Engineers calls it "the creation of technical things and services useful to
man." I would paraphrase that to add an industry emphasis: engineering is linking
an ability to do with specific customer needs and wants. The link is an engineering
design of a useful product or service.
Q. In the light of this definition, how can the young engineer prepare himself
for industry?
A. In college he should absorb as much theory as possible and begin to develop
certain attitudes that will help him later in his profession. The raw material for a
design, information, flows from three general funds: Scientific Knowledge of
Nature; Engineering Technology; and what I call simply Other Relevant Informa-
tion. Academic training places heavy emphasis on the first two areas, as it should.
Engineers in industry draw heavily on theorems, codified information, and signifi-
cant recorded experience basic to engineering disciplines taught in college. The
undergraduate must become knowledgeable in these areas and skilled in the ways of
using this information, because he will have little time to learn this after graduation.
He also must develop a responsive attitude toward the third fund.
Q. As you say, we learn theory in college, but where do we get the "Other
Relevant Information"—the third fund you mentioned?
A. This knowledge is obtained for the most part by actually doing engineering
work. This is information that must be applied to a design to v ke sure that it not
only works, but that it also meets the needs and wants that p: pted its considera-
tion in the first place. For example, we can design refrigerators, turbines, computers,
or missile guidance systems using only information from the first two funds of
knowledge—heat flow, vibration, electronic theory, etc.—and they will work! Hut
what about cost, reliability, appearance, size—will the prospective customer buy
them? The answers to these important design questions are to be found in the third
fund; for example the information to determine optimum temperature ranges, to
provide the features that appeal to users, or to select the best manufacturing
processes. In college you can precondition yourself to seek and accept this sort of
information, but only experience in industry can give you specific knowledge
applicable to a given product.
Q. Could you suggest other helpful attitudes we might develop?
A. Remember, industry exists to serve the needs and wants of the market place,
and the reasons for doing things a certain way arise from the whole spread of condi-
tions which a given design has to satisfy. Learn how to enter into good working
relationships with people. Much of the Other Relevant Information can be picked
up only from others. Also train yourself to be alert and open-minded about your
