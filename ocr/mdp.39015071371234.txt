(The editors are indebted to Mr. F. J. Seabolt, '07, for the facts con-
cerning Mr. Rupley. Mr. Seabolt was probably closer to Mr. Rupley
during the latter years of his life than any other person.)
On December 11 last, occurred the death of Mr. George H. Rupley,
at Schenectady, N. Y. Although not a graduate, Mr. Rupley attended
Michigan for some time, during the years 1884 and 1885. Outside his
own little circle, the name of Rupley has scarcely been heard, although
such genius as he possessed would have made most men famous. He
seemed to care nothing for fame, but worked only for the pleasure that
he found in work.


He was born m Cumberland county, Pa., and as a boy of eight or
nine gave evidence of remarkable ability along mechanical lines. Within
a short distance of his home lived Daniel Drawbaugh, the noted inventor.
Drawbaugh will be remembered as having contested the priority of inven-
tion of the telephone with Bell, and the Supreme Court of the United
States finally decided on a divided court that Bell was entitled to an award
of priority, as against Drawbaugh, because of the hitter's delay. Rupley
undoubtedly did, therefore, some of the very first work on the telephone.
Soon after leaving college, Rupley found employment with the Edison
Machine Co., at Schenectady. This company was afterwards absorbed
by the General Electric Co., and Rupley thus passed into the employment
of this company.
Rupley first came into prominence with the General Electric Co.
when, after spending years in endeavoring to make a suitable varnish for
electrical work, the management finally turned the work over to him.
Owing to the inflammable nature of the materials used, Rupley was given
a tent in which to work, located some distance from the other buildings.
Rupley knew nothing of varnishes at that time, but he succeeded so well
that even up to the time of his death he was considered the company's
expert on insulating materials. The General Electric Company's opinion
of him can best be expressed in the words of General Manager George
E. Emmons, "Rupley always got results."
About fifteen years ago Rupley left the employ of the General Electric
Co., to manufacture insulating materials. He found himself without suffi-
cient capital to carry on the projeet, and was obliged to sell out. His
little business formed the nucleus of the Mica Insulator Co., now the
largest of its kind in the world.
Rupley is best known as the inventor of "enamel wire," of which
millions of pounds a year are now made. He not only invented the wire
itself, but also the machinery with which it is made. This machinery was
entirely automatic, and would insulate five hundred feet of wire a minute,
whereas thirty feet had been the best previous record. Rupley's method
of going about the construction of such a machine as this was peculiar.
No drawing of any kind was made of the machine until after it was com-
pleted. All he asked for was a skilled mechanic and a workshop; the
two, working together, produced the results.
But there is another side to the man—that of the chemist. A member
of the old guard, Rupley was not given serious recognition as a chemist,
but in his own way he accomplished results of which the greatest of
chemists would have been proud. Since he returned to the General Elec-
tric Co. a research laboratory has come into existence. It is said that on
more than one occasion the accomplished chemists connected with this


department have wended their way to the little laboratory of Rupley to ask
his aid. They had failed with all their training. Rupley, by intuition
more than anything else, was usually able to solve their perplexing prob-
lem, and they would return to their more pretentious laboratory, the wiser
for their visit.
In the words of one of his friends, "He was one of the finest fellows'
one could have known. Modest and generous to a fault, he was always
ready to help others. This was particularly noticeable in connection with
his work, where others have often been given credit for results which
properly should have been his. It was achievement which he aimed at
first, last and always, and this satisfied him, even though unaccompanied
by fame or fortune. When Rupley said a thing, it was only necessary to
look into his honest brown eyes to be convinced that it was true. It was
a real privilege to have known him."
It only seems fitting that such an extraordinary man as Rupley
should have a new disease to die of. The disease from which he died was
absolutely new, and has been commented on in the medical journals.
He was never married, and died in his forty-sixth year.


SOME NOTES ON RAILROAD ELECTRIFICATION
MATTERS
By C. L. dB Muralt, Professor of Electrical Engineering.
Railroad electrification problems are discussed by two classes of men:
the electrical engineer, who as a rule is not well versed in practical rail-
roading, and the railroad man, who generally has but a cursory knowledge
of affairs electrical. It must be said that of the two the railroad man
treats the subject in a much more broad-minded manner. The electrical
engineer frequently loses sight of the general aspect of the situation and
limits himself to propounding the advantages of his pet electric scheme,
be it the continuous current, the single-phase or the three-phase system.
Certain advocates of the single-phase alternating current system have
even gone so far as to maintain that no real progress in heavy electric
traction work will be made until their system has been adopted as the
universal electric system.
This attempt to force a certain type of electrical equipment on the
railroad world as a panacea for all conditions seems to be distinctly wrong.
There can be no such thing as a universal electric system. Early steam
railroading leaned toward the development of a standard type of steam
locomotive to be used for every kind of work. Yet, such radically dif-
ferent engines were developed, and are still used, as the Atlantic type for
high speed passenger work and the Mallet compound for heavy mountain
work.
As regards the single-phase system, while it may be admirably
adapted to operate under conditions of light, long distance passenger
service, there is every reason to believe that it is equally unsuited for
other conditions far more numerous.
Each case of railroad electrification should be studied on its own
merits and the particular electric system should be adopted which best
meets the conditions of the special case under consideration. The follow-
ing notes represent an attempt to assist railroad men and others interested
in this subject in understanding the differences, real and imaginary, between
the three rival electric railroad systems.
The continuous current system was introduced into railroad practice
over twenty years ago by Frank J. Sprague on the historical Richmond
road, and it has since been successfully used on many thousands of miles
of road and more recently for the important electrification work of the
New York Central's New York City terminal. It will also be used for


the electrification work of the Pennsylvania's New York City terminal.
The single-phase alternating current system was brought out about six
years ago by B. G. Lamme and has been installed during the last few
years on a number of interesting interurban railroads. It is exemplified
for the heavier work by the equipment which the New York, New Haven
&amp; Hartford has just put into service on a first section of its line between
New York City and Stamford, Conn. The three-phase alternating current
system is thus far not well enough known in America. It has been suc-
cessfully used in Europe for the past fifteen years, for the well known
high speed tests between Berlin and Zossen, and for all recent heavy
electrification work, the Simplon Tunnel, the Giovi Line near Genoa, and
others. The first American installation of this system is the equipment
of the Cascade Division of the Great Northern which is now in course
of construction.
Each of these three rival systems comprises three essential parts,
the electric power house, the conductors along the line, and the locomo-
tives. Let ns take up each of these parts separately.
As regards power house there is not much difference between the
three systems. For very short lines locomotives can be fed direct from
one power house without the use of sub-stations. With continuous cur-
rent this method can be used for lines up to say six or eight miles long.
With single-phase or three-phase alternating currents it can be used
up to say twenty miles. Beyond this, any system will have to use either
several power houses spaced at more or less regular intervals along the
line, or else a central power house producing three-phase alternating cur-
rents at high pressures with sub-stations along the line to transform the
high pressure three-phase currents into low pressure currents, continuous,
single-phase or three-phase, as the case may be, for use on the locomo-
tives. The total efficiency is pobably somewhat greater in the two alter-
nating current systems than in the continuous current system, but the
difference can hardly be large. Generally speaking, the three systems may
be assumed to call, under similar conditions, for power houses of approxi-
mately the same size and approximately the same first cost.
Coming to conductors along the line we find greater differences
between the three systems. By conductors we shall understand all that
is required to conduct the energy from the power house to the locomotives.
Take for example a 2,000 H. P. locomotive. With a 2,000 volt continuous
current system a current of about 700 amperes is required. With a 5,000
volt single-phase or a 3,000 volt three-phase alternating current system
only about 300 amperes must be handled. A pressure of 2,000 volts is
pretty close to the upper limit for continuous currents; 5,000 volts is not
by any means the limit for alternating currents. To collect anything above


say 300 amperes from an overhead line at railroad speeds is difficult.
For heavy work the continuous current system is therefore forced to use a
third rail, while the single-phase and three-phase alternating current sys-
tems can use the overhead wires or third rail as may best suit the con-
ditions. Wherever the pressure generated in the power house differs
from the pressure used in the locomotive, sub-stations are necessary. The
continuous current system must use rotary converter or motor generator
sub-stations to convert the high pressure alternating currents into low
pressure continuous currents. The two alternating current systems use
stationary transformer sub-stations to change from high pressure to low
pressure alternating currents. Convertor sub-stations are more expensive
than stationary transformer sub-stations. The cost of first-class third rail
and overhead wire installations are pretty nearly equal, perhaps with a
slight advantage in favor of third rail. We find, therefore, that wherever
sub-stations are unnecessary, the first cost of conductors along the line
may be taken as being almost the same for the three systems. Where sub-
stations are required, the cost of conducting systems between power house
and locomotives becomes more expensive for the continuous current as
compared with the two alternating current systems, and because of the
higher pressure required, also more expensive for the single-phase as
compared with the three-phase system.
Coming to the locomotives, the differences between the various sys-
tems are very material. It so happens that there are typical examples
of locomotives, of each system, designed and built at pretty nearly the
same time and for very similar service, which may well be directly com-
pared with one another. I refer to the New York Central continuous
current locomotives, the New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford single-phase
alternating current locomotives, and the Italian Simplon three-phase alter-
nating current locomotives. Each of these locomotives weighs about 95
tons and has its axles direct driven by the electric motors without any
intermediary gearing. There the similarity ends. The New York Central
locomotive has four continuous current motors of 550 H.P. each or a
total of 2,200 H.P. The New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford locomotive
has four single-phase alternating current motors of 250 H.P. each or a
total of 1,000 H.P. The Simplon locomotive has two three-phase alter-
nating current motors of 1,500 H.P. each or a total of 3,000 H.P. These
ratings are based on what is called the standard one hour test, which is
today accepted by electrical engineers as furnishing the fairest basis of
comparison. For short periods all of the three locomotives can exert
very much larger powers, the maximum output of the continuous current
motors being about 4,000 H.P., that of the single-phase alternating current
motors about 2,000 H.P., and that of the three-phase alternating current


motors about 8,000 H.P. Based on the one hour rating the continuous
current locomotive produces 23.2 H.P. for each ton of locomotive weight,
the single-phase locomotive 10.5 H.P. and the three-phase locomotive 31.5
H.P. The weight efficiency of the three types is therefore very materially
different and inasmuch as the cost is closely proportional to the weight,
the same amount of locomotive power will cost most in the single-phase
alternating current locomotive, less in the continuous current locomotive,
and least in the three-phase alternating current locomotive, more or less
in the above proportion of weights per H.P. As regards cost of main-
tenance there is this to be said. The three-phase alternating current motor
is unquestionably the most robust of the three and the entire absence of
any commutator in the three-phase motor will undoubtedly be highly
appreciated by all those who know what it costs to maintain commutators
in railroad service. Between the single-phase and the continuous current
motor there is not much difference, at least for light traffic. For handling
heavy trains the single-phase motor is open to objections, because its
inherent characteristics make it impossible for the single-phase motor to
exert while standing still a steady pull without serious injury to its wind-
ing. While data as to maintenance in actual operation is still limited,
what there is of it plainly shows that three-phase locomotives are least
expensive to maintain, continuous current locomotives come next, and
single-phase locomotives are by far the most expensive.
Having thus investigated the characteristics of the three parts com-
prised in any electric system, it is possible to judge with greater accuracy
what are the chances of the three rival systems for adoption in heavy
electric traction work. I repeat, it is dangerous to generalize and each
case must of necessity be treated individually and in great detail. It is
quite permissible, however, to draw the few general conclusions which
follow:
As regards power house there is a slight advantage with the con-
tinuous current system for very short lines, and with the single-phase and
three-phase alternating current systems for medium and long lines.
As regards conductors the three systems are fairly equal for short
lines, and there is an advantage with the single-phase and the three-phase
alternating current systems for medium and long lines.
As regards locomotives the three systems are equal so long as light
trains are considered. For heavy trains the advantages are with the con-
tinuous current and the three-phase alternating current systems.
These comparisons are admittedly crude. But they seem to confirm
pretty plainly the general opinion that the particular field of the con-
tinuous current system is short distance work, both heavy and light,
freight and passenger. The field of the single-phase alternating current


system is long distance work of the lighter kind, such as interurban passen-
ger service. The long distance heavy work, or the real trunk line work,
is quite plainly the field of the three-phase alternating current system,
both from the cost standpoint and because the three-phase system has the
most powerful locomotive.
In any case it is well to remember that the differences between the
three systems are after all not fundamental, but rather differences in
details, just as an electric power house can be built to generate electricity
by the use of a reciprocating steam engine, a steam turbine, or a gas
engine, and aside from differences in unit costs the results will be pretty
nearly the same in either case.
It might be well therefore to close these lines with a word of admoni-
tion to electrical engineers in general, not to fight too much among them-
selves on the question of which system is the best, but rather to concen-
trate their forces on the supplying of general data on the electrification
problem as such, so that we may all see the day brought nearer when
electricity will be used as motive power on every road where it can show
advantages.


THE SCHWEDLER DOME, LOADS AND STRESSES
By A. P. Mills, '06.
The framed dome of the Schwedler type consists of an arrangement
of ribs in vertical meridian planes connected with, and braced by, a series
of horizontal rings which divide the ribs into chords, usually of equal
length. The surface of the dome is spherical and the intersecting ribs
and rings divide that surface into panels of trapezoidal form, each of
which is crossed by two diagonals designed for tension only. Flexible
joints are considered to exist at every connection of rib- and ring-mem-
bers, and the support of the roof-covering is such that loads are applied
only upon the joints of the ribs. The structure is statically determinate
if the load be symmetrically distributed about the vertical axis, but is,
in general, statically indeterminate if the loading be unsymmetrical. The
first condition of loading is satisfied in the case of the dead load and
maximum snow load only (the diagonals then being without stress).
The consideration of an unsymmetrical snow load or wind loads is sub-
ject to certain conditions which will be discussed later under "Wind
Loads."
DEAD LOAD STRESSES.
The following notation will be used referring to a dome having n
ribs and z zones:—(Fig. I.)
o—i—2—3—(n—i)—n !The vertices of a ring proceeding in a counter
clock wise direction.
o—i—2—3—(z—i)—z 'The vertices of a rib proceeding toward the
foot ring.
G°0—Gt&gt;1—G1,—G*j The stress in the rib member in the zone and
rib indicated.
T°0—T'j—T*g—T*2 ' The stress in the ring member in the zone and
ring indicated.
D°0—D°1—D13—Ds2 ' The stress in the diagonal in the zone and
panel indicated.
(The zone index always stands above. See
Fig. i.)
o1—o*—a* The angle of elevation of the rib member of
zone indicated.


Y°—Yl—Y2 The vertical loads upon the panel points in-
dicated.
a The angle between two adjacent ring members.
The vertex load Y (one-fourth the total load upon the four adja-
cent panels), having been determined for every vertex of one rib, the
stresses in every member of that rib and the stresses in the ring members
adjacent to that rib may be found. Owing to symmetry these stresses
represent the stresses in every rib or ring-member in the dome. The
graphical determination of the dead load stresses is dependent on the fol-
lowing principle:
Every zone is independent of any bracing in the zones above, the
stress in the rib-member of any zone being dependent only upon the loads
on that rib above the ring in which the rib-member terminates at its
lower end. In other words, the vertical component of the stress in any
rib member is equal to the total vertical load on that rib above the mem-
ber in question.
We now lay off, in succession, to any convenient scale the loads
Y°, Y», Y* etc. (Fig. 2), the component of Y° in the direction of G°
is the stress in G°, the component of (YO-fY1) in the direction of Gx
is the stress in G1, etc. The difference in the horizontal thrust of G°
and G1i at the vertex 1 must be taken up by the two horizontal ring
members T10 and T1 . If, therefore, we resolve this horizontal resultant
thrust, ab (Fig. 2), into two components af and bf making the angle
a f b= (1800—o) a f represents the stress T10 and b f represents the stress
T1 . Similarly the difference in horizontal thrust of G11 and G2t at ver-
tex 2, be (Fig. 2), is resolved into two components bg and gc which
represent the ring stresses T20 and T2t respectively, etc. It is apparent
that the rib stress will always be compression (—) and that the ring
stress will be compression if the horizontal component of the thrust of
the rib-member below the ring considered exceeds the thrust of the rib-
member above, and tension (-{-) for the reverse condition. It will be
noted also that the topmost ring (the lantern-ring) will always be in
compression and the foot-ring always in tension. The vertical com-
ponent of the stress in each of the rib-members G°0, G0V G°2, etc., is
i/n (total load on apex of dome).
Owing to the fact that a snow load cannot be carried on the lower
zones, if the dome approaches a hemisphere, the ring stress in a particular
zone for such a loading may be of an opposite nature from the dead load
stress in that ring and the dead-load and snow-load stress-diagrams
should be kept distinct to obtain maximum stresses in all members.


WIND LOAD.
The determination of the values of the effective normal wind loads
on the vertices of the dome is dependent upon an empirical formula.
If we designate by N the effective normal component of the wind pres-
sure upon a surface F;—
N = p.f(«).F
wherein p represents the unit pressure of the wind on a plane surface per-
pendicular to the direction of the wind and « is the angle the surface
makes with the direction of the wind, (p varies from 20-45 lbs. per sq. ft.
dependent on the velocity of the wind.) The value of f (&lt;•&gt;) has been
variously determined by different investigators. The most commonly used
expressions for f (&lt;■&gt;), that derived by Duchemin (2 sin «/i + sin2«), and
that proposed by Hutton (sin wx.&amp;jacMw—ij are based upon tests per-
formed by exposing plane surfaces to a current of air. It appears how-
ever that these expressions will not hold for such a surface as a sphere
wherein the angle *&gt; is a variable and an opportunity is afforded
for the current of air to be deflected and to escape with less commotion
than is possible in the case of a plane surface. Experiments also show
that a partial vacuum is formed behind a thin plate submitted to an air
current so that the resistance to the current offered by the plate or, in
other words, the effective pressure upon the face of the plate is less than
the actual amount recorded by the supporting apparatus used in such
tests. If a cube or a cylinder presented endwise to the current be sub-
stituted for the thin plate, the end area being equal to the area of the
plate, the influence of this partial vacuum upon the measured reactions
in the first case is clearly shown by the diminished value of the reactions
recorded in the latter case. The formula of Duchemin and Hutton may
therefore be expected to give excessively large effective loads if applied
to each panel of a dome successively.
The value of f(&lt;") proposed by the Prussian Academy of
Architects is f(«) = sin2&lt;*. If this value be applied to a hemi-
spherical dome the integrated value of the component of the pres-
sure upon the entire dome in the direction of the wind will be
50% of the pressure upon a plane semicircular area of the same diameter
placed in a position perpendicular to the direction of the wind. Experi-
mental data concerning the resistance offered by a sphere to wind pres-
sure are not extensive ,such records as we do find however, tend to justify
the value of f («) = sin2«. Kernot, in 1893, performed tests on small
spheres submitted to an air current whereby he derived 36% as the ratio
of the component of the effective pressure on the sphere parallel to the
wind to the pressure on a plane circular area of the same diameter. Cap-


tain Bixby, 1895, recommends 40% as the value of the same ratio. Both
Kernot and Bixby assert that the value must be increased 20% in the
event of the close proximity of a plane surface to the sphere, thereby
offering an obstacle to the free escape of the air. From experiments
performed with cones and wedge-shaped bodies (presented with the point
toward the current) Duchemin derived a value of f(«) = sin2". The
use of the formula N = p.sin2&amp;&gt; F appears therefore to be sanctioned by
what experimental data are at hand.
The wind may be considered to act in a horizontal direction and
the angle o&gt; will, for convenience sake, be expressed in terms of its hori-
zontal and vertical projections. In Fig. 3 I in elevation and I1 in plan
represent a roof surfact whose normal makes with the horizontal plane
the angle &lt;t&gt;. For this plane «&gt; = (900—4&gt;) and the angle between the wind
and the normal to the surface is EAC = f If, now, we revolve the
plane about the vertical axis B C the angle &lt;■&gt; is changed; we may call
this new angle « for the roof surface II revolved through the horizontal
angle 8 from the position of I. The direction of the wind now makes an
angle E AXC with the normal to the surface II. The lengths of the
sides of this triangle may be determined from their projections,—
Let r be the length AtB. Then:—
AjC =ac = r/cos &lt;P; c e = r tan &lt;t&gt;; c1e1 — r sin *

or, sin2 &lt;*, = cos2 &lt;t&gt; cos2 0
and, N = p cos2 &lt;t&gt; cos2 B F
and the unit normal pressure will be,—
p1 = p cos2 &lt;P cos2 0.
Consider dF (Fig. 4), the area bounded by two horizontal circles
subtending the angle d 0 at the center of the sphere and by two meridians
subtending the angle d&lt;? at the center in the horizontal projection, as


13
the element of integration of a spherical surface of radius r. The area
d F = r2 cos &lt;t&gt; d ^ d 0. The normal pressure on d F will be,—
dp1 = p cos2 &lt;t&gt; cos2 8 d F = pr2 cos8 &lt;t&gt; cos2 * d &lt;t&gt; d 0.
The component of dp1 in the direction parallel to the wind direction is
dp" = dp' cos &lt;t&gt; cos 8 = pr2 cos4 8 cos3 &lt;t&gt; &amp;&lt;t&gt; d 0.
Integrating dp"between the limits &lt;t&gt; = &lt;t&gt;*, # = 0*+i; * = 0X, 8-=8 • we
obtain an expression for the total component of the wind pressure parallel
to the wind direction on the area bounded by these limits,—

If we choose the limits to include the entire exposed half of the
dome we obtain 2 d P" = lA P "T2- (This is 50% of the total normal
pressure on a semicircular plane area.)
It will be convenient .instead of using the above general expression
for the load upon any panel, to determine the load carried by each rib,
afterward finding the portion of each rib load to be applied at the several
joints of that rib. In order to ascertain the extent of the load tributary
to any one rib it is necessary to determine the horizontal angle *r, Fig. 5,
made with the wind direction by the resultant of the loads upon the seg-
ment of the dome between the windward rib and each succeeding rib
in turn. The total normal pressure upon the segment of the dome from

If the limits of integration include % the dome surface 8% = 900 and:—
R sin *r sin &lt;t&gt;T = 1/12 pr2.
Instead of computing the successive values of R sin *r sin &lt;t&gt;T the graph-
ical method shown on the left of Fig. 6 gives the required components
of R for any particular case. Lay oif BC= 1/12pr2 and CA making
the angle CAB equal tan-'aso; by means of the tangents given in the
table, lay off the successive values of 8T = i-A-B, 2-A-B, 3-A-B,
etc. With B'C as radius and C as center describe the quadrant C'B'D;
draw the radii 4-C, 5-C, 6-C, etc., making with C'B' the angles §v «2, «8,
etc.; drop a perpendicular from 4 on C'B' intersecting C'B' at 7, from
7 construct a perpendicular to 4-C intersecting the latter at point 8, and
from 8 a perpendicular to C'B' again intersecting C'B' at 9. B'-o, will
represent in magnitude 1/12 pr2 (1—cos8^). By similar construction
from 5, and 6 we obtain:—
B'—12= 1/12 pr2 (1—cos»»2), and B'—15 = 1/12 pr2 (1-
cos3»3).
The lengths B'—9, B'—12, B'—15 represent the vertical component of the
component perpendicular to the direction of the wind of the wind load
on the portion of the dome from 8 = o, to 6 = 8^; 8 = 0 to 8 = 8^;
8 = 0 to * = *3 respectively. Parallels to B A from the points 9, 12,
and 15 will intersect A-i, A-2, and A-3 at points I, 2 and 3; A-l repre-
sents the vertical component of the resultant of the wind pressure between
the limits 8 =0 and * = 8^; A-2—the vertical component of the resultant
pressure between the limits 8 — o and * =#2, etc. Draw through the point
1 the line 16-17 making with A B the angle 8 through 2 draw 17-18
making the angle *2 with A B, through 3 draw 18-19 making with A B
the angle 0g. A—16 will represent that portion of the vertical com-
ponent of the total normal load on the windward rib derived from the
segment on one side of that rib, i. e., Vi the vertical component of the
total normal load on windward rib. 16-17 is the vertical component of
the total normal load on the second rib, 17-18 the vertical component
of the total normal load on third rib, etc. The construction here
made is for a dome having four ribs per quadrant. For the case of the
dome of Fig. 1 having only 2 ribs per quadrant it is necessary to locate
the point 2 only and then construct through 2 the dotted line 20-21 making
the angle 21-20—B = 45°; A—20 is one-half the vertical component of
the total normal load on the windward rib, 20-21 the vertical component
of the total normal load on rib 1, and 21-C the vertical component of the
total normal load on rib 3.
To ascertain the portion of the total load on a rib to be applied at
each vertex, it is necessary to determine the angle of elevation of the


resultant of all loads on the ribs from 0 = 0 to &lt;t&gt;z=&lt;t&gt;1. The total pres-
sure on the dome between the limits 0 = o, 0=rgo° and &lt;t&gt;=:0, &lt;t&gt; = &lt;fi' is:

If R is the resultant of all loads on one-fourth of the dome between the

The load upon each vertex of the windward rib and each successive
rib are now determined graphically by construction of Fig. 8. Lay off
AB and AC making the angle C A B = tan-1.4244, and the length
B C =A C equal to the vertical component of the resultant of all loads
on the windward rib = twice length A—16 (Fig. 6) for a dome having
four ribs per quadrant or equal to twice length A—20 (Fig. 6) for dome
having two ribs per quadrant. Construct A—1 (Fig. 8) making the angle
1 A B = &lt;t&gt;\ (the angle of inclination of the resultant of all loads on
any rib from the foot-ring to the first ring above); by means of the
above table for tan &lt;f&gt;T construct A—2 and A—3 forming with A B the
angles &lt;P2r and 4&gt;*T. Now make a construction on the left of Fig. 8 sim-
ilar to that used in Fig. 6 except that we here derive values of (1—cos*^1)
instead of values of (1—cos»9). Describe the quadrant of a circle C'B'D
about C as center with C B as radius and lay off the angles &lt;t&gt;1, &lt;t&gt;2, 4&gt;3, etc.,
from C'B'; by means of the successive perpendiculars B'—4, 4—5, 5—6 and


'9
6—7 we determine the length B'—7 = BC (i—cos4*1). By drawing
B'-8-9-io-ii and B'-i2-i3-i4-i5 in the same manner we derive
B'-n = BC (i~cos4*2) and B'-is = BC (i—cos4*3).
BC (i—cos4*1) =B'-7 represents the vertical component of the result-
ant of all loads on the windward rib up to ring I, B C (i—cos4*2)=B'-u
the vertical component of the resultant of loads up to ring 2, and
B C (cos4*3) = B'—15 the vertical component of the resultant of loads
up to ring 3. Drawing 7—I, 11—2, and IS—3, parallel to A B, the lengths
intercepted on A—I, A—2, and A—3 will represent the resultants of all
loads on the windward rib up to ring I, ring 2, and ring 3, respectively;
finally, construct through I the line 16—17 making the angle 17—16—B
= *l, through 2 the line 17—18 making the angle 18—20—B = *2, and
through 3 the line 18—19 making the angle 19—21—B = *".
A—16 = total normal load on foot ring joint of windward rib.
16—17 = total normal load on 1st joint above foot ring of windward rib.
17—18 = total normal load on 2nd joint above foot ring of windward rib.
18—19 = total normal load on 3rd joint above foot ring of windward rib.
19— C = total normal load on 4th joint above foot ring of windward rib.
To obtain the joint loads on the rib next to the windward rib and
on the succeeding ribs, lay off A E', A F'f A G' and A H' (Fig. 8) equal
respectively to 16—17, 17—18, 18—19 and 19—C (Fig. 6) and draw E E',
FF, G G' and H H' parallel to A B. For rib next to windward rib
begin at E and draw E—22 parallel to C—19; from its intersection with
A—19 draw 22—23 parallel to 18—19; from the intersection of this line
with A—18 draw 23—24 parallel to 17—18; and from the intersection of
23—24 with A—17 draw 24—25 parallel to 16—17. A—25 will represent
the normal load on the foot ring joint of the rib next to the windward rib,
25—24—the normal load on the 1st joint above the foot ring
24—23—the normal load on the 2nd joint above the foot ring.
23—22—the normal load on the 3rd joint above the foot ring.
22—E—the normal load on the 4th joint above the foot ring.
Making an exactly similar construction for the 2nd rib beginning at F,
and for the 3rd rib beginning at G, the joint load for every vertex on the
■dome is known. In the dome having four ribs per quadrant treated in
Fig. 8 and in the case of any dome having more than four ribs per
quadrant the load upon the rib 900 removed from the windward rib is
too small to be considered at all.


WIND LOAD STRESSES.
For an unsymmetrical loading, such as wind loads, the Schwedler
dome is indeterminate unless the following condition is satisfied,—the
sum of the total number of members stressed and the supporting forces
around the base of the dome cannot exceed three times the number of
vertices. The proof of this condition depends only upon the conditions
of equilibrium; the forces converging at any one vertex, external loads
and internal stresses in the members, are in equilibrium with one another;
for each vertex we can express only three conditions of equilibrium,
therefore the number of unknown stresses at any vertex cannot exceed
the number of equations of equilibrium if the structure is to be statically
determinate. The effect of this condition is to place three limitations
upon the structural form of the dome:—
(a). The dome frame must be left open at the top, i. e., the rib mem-
bers are not prolonged to an intersection at the apex of the dome
but terminate at the topmost ring.
(b). No foot ring can be considered (except in case the supporting forces
can be made to act along the line of action of one member of the
foot ring at each vertex.)
(c). Only one cross-diagonal in each panel can be considered to act at
any one time.
The substitution of a rigid lantern ring, in place of one assumed free
to turn at each joint, introduces (by reason of the internal transverse
stresses in the ring itself at each vertex) the same element of indeter-
mination as the closing of the topmost ring by rib-members.
If the design of the diagonals is such that they will resist tension
only it may be assumed in the computation of stresses that all diagonals
are inclined in one direction and where the diagonal stress determined
under that assumption becomes compression substitute the opposite diag-
onal and determine the change of stress in the four members forming
the panel considered. The stresses in the four members of this quadri-
lateral are alone affected by the reversal of the diagonal. The amount
of this change of stress is determined as follows: If we substitute the
opposite diagonal member for the diagonal Dm (Fig. 9), we must replace
the stress in the latter by two equal and opposite forces Dm (Fig. 10).
The stress diagram (Fig. n), gives the resulting stresses in the four
members of the quadrilateral due to the forces Dm acting as shown in
Fig. 10. It will be noted that if the trapezoid be drawn to such a scale
that the diagonal length represents the stress Dm the stresses in the other
members of the quadrilateral arc given by the lengths of the sides of the
trapezoid but the stresses in the two parallel sides of the trapezoid (Fig.


10), are reversed in position in the trapezoid of the stress diagram (Fig.
ll). (The stress in the short side B D of the trapezoid of Fig. 10 is
represented by the long side bd of Fig. n.)
The normal force due to wind acting at each joint having been
determined, this force P*m will now be resolved into two components;
one in a horizontal direction through the joint (x) and the axis of the
dome PHxm, the other along the line of action of the rib-member directly
below the joint in question PGxm. PH*m is now resolved into two com-
ponents, pTxm and pT*^,, in the directions of the two adjacent ring
members. The stresses in the topmost zone may now be determined.
Fig. 12 represents Rib o (windward rib) in elevation.
Fig. 13 represents Rib I in elevation, also Rib. 7.
Fig. 14 represents Rib 2 in elevation, also Rib 6.
Fig. 15 represents the panels of Zone 1 in their true size.
Fig. 16 represents the panels of Zone 2 in their true size.
Resolve P10, the load on the uppermost joint of the windward rib,
into two components; one horizontal = PH10, (Fig. 12), and one in the
line of G1 =PG10. Resolve PH10 again into two components, p°Tl7 and
p'T1^ in the line of T1T and Tl respectively. Now proceed to
join 1 of the topmost ring (Fig. 13). Resolve P11 into two
components, PG11 and pH1^ as before, and further resolve PH11 into two
components, P1T11 and p1^1,,. Considering the ring member T10 (Fig.
15), the thrust from P11 = p1^ must be the stress in T1,,, and the thrust
P°T10 from P1,, must be carried jointly by T10 and the diagonal D10.
The component of D1,, in the line of T1,, must be pt1,, = pOT1,, —p1^
(Fig. 12), the stress in D10 is, therefore, the component of Pt10 in the
line of T&gt;1g (Fig. 15), and the component of D10 in the line of Gl0 is
dG1,,. The stress G1,, (Fig. 12) is the difference between pG1,, and DGl0
since the load P1 causes compression in G1. and the compression diag-
onal D* tends to produce tension in G1 .
The proceedure for determining the stresses in the members of the
other panels of the topmost zone is exactly the same as the foregoing
treatment for stresses T10, D1^ and G1,,, the procedure for determining
the stresses in the members of the panels of zone 2 and each succeeding
zone differs from the above treatment for zone 1 because the effect of
the stresses in the members of the zone above the one considered must
be considered together with the action of the external loads. Upon joint
o of ring 2 we must take into account, in addition to the external load
P20, the thrust G1,, from the rib above and the stress in the tension diag-
onal Da7; upon joint 1 of ring 2 we have the load P2j, the thrust G1^
and the thrust D1^ etc.


Considering joint o of ring 2 we resolve P20 into two components;
one in the line of G20 = PG20, the other horizontal = PH*0 (Fig. 12).
The stress D*7 is resolved into two components aT27 and iG10 (Fig. 15);
combine G1,. and iG10 algebraically and resolve the resulting force into
two components; one in the line of G20 = GG20, the other horizontal
— PH20. The algebraic sum of PH20 and GH20 is now resolved into two
components °T27 and °T20 in the directions of the two adjacent ring
members; °T27 ± dT27 is the stress T27.
In the same manner (Fig. 13) combine G11 and aG11 algebraically
and resolve the resulting force into two components GG21 and QH21; com-
bine GH21 with PH21 and again resolve the resulting horizontal force
into two components, 1T20 and 1T21, in the direction of the two adjacent
ring members; 1T20 ± dT20 is the stress T20. The difference between
°T20 and 1T20 will be t20 (Fig. 16) or the component of the diagonal
stress D20 in the line of T20; the component of the diagonal stress in the
line of G20 is DG20 and the algebraic sum of GG20, PG20 and DG20 (Fig.
12) is the stress G20.
The determination of the stresses in the members of the other
panels of zone 2 and members of all zones below zone 2 differs in no
respect from the above treatment. The supporting force or reaction
at the foot of each rib is equal to, and oppositely directed to the resultant
of the external load at that point combined with the force represented
by the resultant of the stresses in the rib member and the diagonal meet-
ing at that point of support. Hinges are assumed at every point of sup-
port- :■ .. 'Vt-J£.£


LOW PRESSURE OR "EXHAUST"STEAM TURBINES
J. A. Moyer, Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engineering.
Mem. A. S. M. E.
Early in the period of the development of the steam turbine it
became apparent that this new prime mover was particularly well suited
to operation with much higher ratios of expansion than experience had
shown to be permissible with reciprocating engines. It has never been
considered practicable to design reciprocating engines to operate at a
higher vacuum than about 26 inches on account of the great size of the
low pressure cylinders which would be required to handle steam at very
low pressures. The enormous increase in volume of dry saturated steam
as the pressure approaches a perfect vacuum is shown very clearly by the
following table:
Vacuum, Inches. Volume, Cubic feet per pound.
26 176
28 342
39 665
It will be observed that the volume of the steam is almost exactly doubled
as the vacuum is increased from 26 to 28 inches and that at 29 inches
vacuum, which is not at all unusual in turbine practice, the volume is
very nearly four times as great as at 26 inches.
For a given change of vacuum the economy or water rate of a steam
turbine is changed much more than that of a reciprocating steam engine.
The steam consumption of a good Corliss triple-expansion engine can-
not usually be reduced more than ZA per cent per inch as the vacuum
is increased from 25 to 28 inches. Between the same limits, however, the
steam consumption of a Parsons or Curtis turbine is reduced from 4 to 7
per cent per inch of vacuum.1
Reciprocating engines and steam turbines have, however, distinct
fields in which their highest efficiencies can be attained. A reciprocating
engine is most efficient when taking steam at a high pressure and exhaust-
ing at about atmospheric, while a steam turbine works to the best advan-
tage at low pressures—particularly when exhausting at vacuums much
too low for reciprocating engines. Mechanical friction, due to pistons
of enormous sizes moving in correspondingly large low-pressure cylinders,
1C. A. Parsons, Proceedings Institution of Electrical Engineers,

limits the pacticable expansion in reciprocating engines; but in the steam
turbine, on the other hand, the mechanical losses—due to rotation in a
fluid medium—are very much reduced as the vacuum is increased and
purely mechanical friction comparable with that of the rubbing surfaces
in the reciprocating engine is, in nearly all types, almost negligible.1
Consideration of the actual cyclic efficiencies of steam engines and
turbines is also important and interesting. The thermodynamic efficiency
of a good Corliss engine; meaning, the efficiency ratio in per cent of the
Rankine-Clausius cycle; or, in other words, the efficiency in per cent of
the avaialble energy in the steam between the initial and final conditions
of the expansion, is invariably higher when operating non-condensing than
when working condensing. Steam turbines, on the other hand, can be
designed to give maximum thermodynamic efficiency when taking steam
supplied at 15 to 20 pounds per square inch absolute and exhausting into
a vacuum of about 28 inches. In fact manufacturers will today guarantee
an efficiency on this basis of practically 70% for a non-condensing engine
and the same efficiency for the steam turbine. Now this is significant
because this over-all efficiency is about 5 per cent greater than can be:
expected with either a complete expansion reciprocating engine or steam
turbine for the same conditions of pressure and superheat, and each oper-
ating at the vacuum giving the lowest steam consumption.
In 1889 the first condensing turbine of about 100 horsepower was
designed by Parsons for an expansion ratio of 100 by volume. The ex-
pansion was effected in two turbines of the double parallel-flow type, the
low pressure turbine taking steam from the exhaust of the high pressure
turbine at about atmospheric pressure and expanding it down to 1 pound
absolute. The striking feature presented by this design was the very
high estimated efficiency of this low pressure portion. A separate low
pressure turbine was not, however, constructed till 1902. Such low
pressure or exhaust turbines are usually designed to take steam at
one pound gauge pressure and expand it efficiently to about 28 inches of
vacuum. They can be advantageously applied in almost any case where
reciprocating engines are now used with the result that there will be
considerable improvement in the net economy of the plant, and a very
large increase in the output without any addition to the boiler installation.
Low-pressure steam turbines when thus applied to use exhaust steam
from non-condensing engines are essentially machines for utilizing a waste
product. It may be said they are machines for attaining "the Utopian
condition of getting something for nothing." Fig. 1 is a copy of a shop

bine. The exhaust steam from the engines enters through the annular
space H and is distributed to the right and left sections of Parsons
blading. The upper half of the drawing is a section of the rotor and
shows the method of construction. The exhaust is discharged through
the base as indicated by arrows. The openings I, I, are provided for con-
venient inspection of the blading. They are covered with suitable covers
in which automatic relief valves are fitted.

The initial pressure of low pressure steam turbines is usually that
of the exhaust steam from non-condensing engines. With steam admitted
to the engine at 200 pounds and exhausted from the turbine at 28 inches
vacuum! theoretically there is no difference in the total economy of such
a unit provided the exhaust turbine takes steam within the range of 7
to 15 pounds per square inch absolute. This condition is shown well by
the following table due to Parsons.8

Owing to the rapid development of the turbine industry for high
speed work and the close attention to this branch of the turbine required
of designers, the "combination" system of reciprocating engines and tur-
bines was comparatively neglected. Only recently the advantages of this
system have come to be generally recognized, and particularly in connec-
tion with marine propulsion. Parsons has never advised the installation
of an "all turbine" arrangement for ships designed for a speed of less
than 15 knots, and for moderate or slow speeds his designers have rec-
ommended the "combination" system. According to one of his designs
for a cargo vessel intended for a speed of ii$4 knots, if provided with
a reciprocating engine discharging steam into the turbine at 7 pounds
per square inch absolute pressure, the steam consumption was esti-
mated to be 15 to 20 per cent less than that of an "all turbine" arrange-
ment, or of triple-expansion engines of the type usually fitted to this
class of vessel. The "combination" system gives a vessel also greater
maneuvering power than if driven only by turbines.
There is a particular field for low pressure turbines in connection
with power stations which are operated non-condensing, for the reason
that a natural supply of cooling water is not available and where it is
probably not profitable to build cooling towers because of the small gain
in economy with the reduction of the exhaust pressure of reciprocating
engines. In such cases, however, if low-pressure turbines are installed,
often as much power can be expected from the turbines as from the en-
gines and under these conditions then, there can be no question of the
resulting economy of installing suitable condensing apparatus and cooling
towers. As an example of the possibilities of such installations, a case
may be cited of which the data is probably quite reliable. A 1000 horse-
power non-condensing plant equipped with reciprocating engines which


27
operated 3000 hours per year with an average fuel consumption of 2.5
pounds of coal per horse-power-hour, was improved so much by the ad-
dition of a 1000 horsepower low-pressure turbine and condensing appara-
tus for operating at 28 inches vacuum together with a suitable cooling
tower, that the plant "was made to deliver 2000 horsepower for 3000
hours per year with 1.25 pounds of coal per horsepower-hour."* The
output of the plant was therefore doubled without any addition to the
boiler equipment or to the fuel cost for the plant, and it is stated, with-
out any additional labor expense.

In most condensing engines the gain in economy over non-condens-
ing operation does not exceed 30 per cent. Even under the most favor-
able conditions of load; and under overload conditions the gain by con-
densing, is much smaller. In most cases a reciprocating engine, when oper-
ated non-condensing, will give at least 75 per cent as much output for the
same steam consumption as when used condensing. Now if this same amount
of steam when exhausted from the engine is discharged into a low-pressure
turbine with good condensing facilities, it will produce very nearly as
much work as the high pressure steam in the engine. Under ordinary
conditions, therefore, a net gain of approximately 100 per cent over
existing condensing engine operation can be obtained by installing low-
pressure turbines; and under overload conditions, where the efficiency

of the engine falls off, and where its gain by vacuum is greatly dimin-
ished, the advantages will be much greater for the turbine.
Fig. 2 shows by curves results obtained with a 22x44x24 Rice and
Sargent engine and generator which has been operated for some years
at Schenectady, N. Y. This unit operates a 250 volt, direct current gen-
erator, and ordinarily runs with a load of about 1200 kilowatts, con-
densing or non-condensing. Tests of this engine were accurately made
by weighing the condensed steam to determine the effect on the economy
with a constant steam How and changing the vacuum. Curves in the
figure show the performance under condensing and non-condensing oper-
ation, as well as what could be accomplished with this engine in com-

bination with a good low-pressure turbine. The rates of gain will seem
extraordinary; but they are probably representative of the possibilities
in many condensing plants operating under ordinary conditions. Results
obtained from these tests are tabulated below:

It should be observed that the amount of steam necessary to deliver
2500 Kilowatts with the engine and turbine working condensing, is prac-
tically the same as the amount required to produce approximately 1500
Kilowatts from the engine alone, when operating condensing, and also


29
practically the same as is required to deliver 1265 Kilowatts from the
unit operating non-condensing. In other words, not a pound of addi-
tional fuel is required to produce these results, nor is any additional
boiler investment made necessary.
Possible improvements are so great that no power user can afford
to ignore them. The saving of fuel effected by such changes will very
soon pay for the additional capital charges, even where increased capacity
is not required.
Economy curves of a Westinghouse double-flow, low-pressure tur-
bine are shown in Fig. 3. The pressure of the steam delivered to the
turbine was approximately atmospheric. The vacuum, as shown by the
curves, was 27.5 inches for one test and 28 inches for another.
Another Westinghouse turbine built to operate in connection with
high pressure reciprocating engines gave the following results in shop test:
Initial steam pressure, 15 pounds per square inch absolute.
Superheat, 40° F.
Vacuum (referred to 30 barometer), 23 inches.
Load, 1500 brake horsepower.
35.5 pounds steam per brake horsepower-hour.
In all these tests the exhaust was condensed in a surface condenser,
which assures accuracy in measuring the steam consumption.
A Curtis exhaust steam turbine installed in Philadelphia receives
exhaust steam from reciprocating engines at a pressure of 15 to 16
pounds per square inch absolute and exhausts into a condenser with an
average vacuum of 28 inches. The turbine has no governor, but takes
all the steam the engines will supply. The output over and above that
obtained from the reciprocating engines is increased about 66 per cent
for the same steam consumption. With dry, saturated steam at atmos-
pheric pressure delivered to the turbine, the guaranteed steam consump-
tion is 36 pounds per Kilowatt at full load, and 40 pounds per Kilowatt
at half load. It is stated that the actual test results are probably at least
10 per cent better.
Most applications of low-pressure turbines have been made in col-
lieries and steel mills, where non-condensing engines are the rule. Re-
sults are, however, so satisfactory that the design of new plants having
a compound engine with a smaller low-pressure cylinder than is usually
provided ,discharging its exhaust into a steam turbine, is likely to become
common. Such combinations give better steam economy than can be
obtained from either reciprocating engines alone or turbines alone.
In a report on the economic possibilities of low-pressure turbines
made for the Cambridge Electric Light Company by Professor Ira N.
Hollis it is stated that the steam consumption of the station as it is now


running is 22.2 pounds per Kilowatt-hour (including auxiliaries) which
could be reduced to 16.8 pounds per Kilowatt-hour by the installation of
low-pressure steam turbines. This is a saving of 5.4 pounds of steam
per Kilowatt-hour or of about 24.4 per cent. Besides this gain in
economy there is also the advantage that the output of the station can
be increased from 4500 to 6000 Kilowatts without any additional expen-
diture for boilers or coal. To this statement of the conditions Professor
Hollis adds: "The saving represented by the preceding figures is, on the
whole, based on a conservative estimate of the power available in the
turbine and I think it would be fully realized with a vacuum at 28.5
inches. I understand that the General Electric Company are prepared
to guarantee a steam consumption of about 15 pounds per Kilowatt-hour.
My own opinion is that if the guarantees can be realized without trouble
with the auxiliaries, no modern compound steam engine plant will be
complete without a low-pressure turbine. In fact, no electric light com-
pany can afford to run the compound engine alone."
It should be added that there is also another field open to the low-
pressure steam turbine. The hot cooling water from the jackets of large
gas engines could be heated by the exhaust gases, and the low-pressure
steam thus formed would drive a steam turbine.

THE THEORY OF SECONDARY STRESSES IN
TRUSSES
A Suggested Method of Computation for Manderla's Problem,
By John H. Griffith, Assoc. Mem. Am. Soc. C. E.
NATURE OF SECONDARY STRESSES
In the calculation of bridge trusses and other steel frameworks,
those stresses which are derived by static analyses have come to be
generally known among engineers as primary stresses. They are obtained
upon the assumption of ideal joints without physical restraint, and the
consequent longitudinal delivery of stress thru the member; and for the
ordinary span bridges which come up in the routine practice of the con-
sulting engineer give a fair first approximation to the state of stress in
the structure suitable for the design of the individual truss members. But
in the actual condition of things, as is well known, the fundamental as-
sumptions which underlie the static considerations can seldom be more
than partially fulfilled even under carefully prepared specifications and
well executed designs. For example the top chords of bridge trusses
are usually constructed as continuous members thruout their length, as
is nearly always true of the stringer system. Floor beams and lateral
bracing are likewise rigidly riveted at their end. There is in fact an in-
creasing tendency toward riveted joints thruout the truss for purposes
of stiffness. Whether the whole structure is riveted at the joints or not
there is a large measure of restraint due to a friction moment which is
exhibited as a force at the pin periphery due to the direct stress into the
coefficient of friction, and which acts with an arm equal to the radius
of the pin. In his report upon the Quebec Bridge Schneider showed that
this latter cause gave stresses which were some 30 or 40% of the primary
stresses.
In addition to the friction force on the pin, there may be the fric-
tion on faces of eye bar heads or other members, as well as the nut
surface. Engineers in dismantling old structures have sometimes noted
also that a process of cementation has taken place between the pin and
the various members so that it is necessary to remove the pin forcibly
with a sledge. Such effects as these cited have led Engesser (Karlsruhe)
to make the general statement that in the case of American bridges the
restraint at the pin is nearly always sufficient to prevent a readjustment
of members after the load comes on the bridge. Another class of stresses
whose action on the truss is quite similar to those induced by pin friction


is due to the non-intersection of the centroid axes of truss members
at a common point of the joint. The well known case cited by Johnson
("Framed Structures") of a girder of one of the elevated roads shows
that this defect may cause stresses as high as 75% of the primary stresses.
The general term of secondary stresses has been applied to those
arising out of such conditions as have been enumerated together with
other stresses of similar nature. Their consideration enters into the
problem when a more critical analysis than that of the approximate
methods of statics is necessary. While the nature of such stresses is
well understood by German and French Engineers, English and Ameri-
can engineers have quite neglected them. In fact Professor John Perry
has intimated (Mechanics, page 157) that no general method exists and
that the problem is indeterminate.
This neglect, with consequent lack of knowledge among engineers,
is perhaps due to the fact that time is required for the absorption of
scientific discoveries, but in America it is chiefly due to the fact that
close competition among the bridge companies has not permitted the
extra expense attendant upon the necessary calculations which at the
best are more or less involved and laborious. Conscientious engineers
who have wished to provide for these stresses have usually treated the
problem qualitatively, in so far as possible, thru a trained judgment and
by means of suitable clauses in specifications.
IMPORTANCE OF A STUDY OF SECONDARY STRESSES.
While economic considerations in the past have perhaps warranted
approximate and elementary calculation of the stresses and strains in
bridges, the usual reasons advanced by practical men against refined
methods are not pertinent today. A number of comparatively recent fail-
ures of large structures has shown the inadequacy of the methods of
calculation heretofore in vogue, as has also been further adduced by pub-
lished tests on large bridge members by Buchanan and others.
There are, however, a number of considerations which have arisen
which tend to obviate the practical objections heretofore urged against
the application of the more refined analyses in the computing room. Chief
among these is the centralization of the numerous smaller companies into
a few large industries, with the attendant economies of administration
in the engineering as well as the business branches. This centralization
of industry has fostered in America a more general knowledge of the
mechanics of structures partly by a process of natural selection whereby
able engineers have specialized along these lines and have naturally grav-
itated to the large concerns, and partly thru the growth and accumulation
of extensive archives of designs which could be studied comparatively and
analyzed.


The case is quite similar with the railroad companies. In the office
of Engineer of Bridges of a large railway company designs and stress
sheets are filed and classified for every bridge on the road. If a rigid
analysis is made of the stresses in one structure it may often serve for
qualitative comparison with others of like scope, without necessarily going
thru the more involved calculations for each structure.
There are some structures where one element of the construction
is repeated a great many times in a multiple system as in elevated rail-
ways, viaducts, etc. In such a case the extra calculation being but a
small item of the whole cost, would greatly increase the real knowledge
of the structure, and avoid such subsequent criticisms as have been made
by Waddell that on certain of these structures an average of "one hun-
dred loose rivets per month per mile" have to be removed and the parts
reriveted thus employing a force of men continually for such work. A
little study of secondary stresses by the designer would obviate this
necessity and save the constant expenditure for maintenance.
Aside from the economic reasons, the writer believes that there is
no better training of judgment to the designing engineer than that which
is afforded by the study of secondary stress and strain effects in struc-
tures. As was long ago well brought out by Dupin (Developpments de
Geometrie) "in the actual state of the Mathematical Sciences, the only
means whereby to prevent their domain from becoming too vast for our
intelligence is to generalize more and more the principles which these
sciences embrace so that a small number of truths general and prolific
may in the mind of man be the abridged expression of particular facts."
A step in this direction has been made by Manderla* who in his success-
ful treatment of the problem of the secondary stresses induced in struc-
tures with rigid joints when under strain has made an advance upon the
methods of Bertot, Bresse, Clapeyron, Heppel and others. The writer
believes that the real value of Manderla's Principle to science is that he
has given the initial steps in a generalized treatment of the continuous
girder which will apply to planar and spatial structures in an analagous
manner as the continuous girder itself is a generalization of the beam
principle.
Little has been published in America regarding Manderla's method.
So far as the writer is aware the earliest exposition was by Bender in
the Railroad Gazette (1884). Recently Hiroi and Grimm have published
•"Losung der Preisaufgabe: Welche Spannungen entstehen in den
Staben eines Fachwerktragers dadurch, dass die winkel der Fachwerk-
dreiecke durch die Belastung eine Anderung erleiden"? Jahresbericht der
Miinchener Techn. Hochsch. 1878. An account of Manderla's solution
is also given by Engesser in "Zusatzkrafte und Nebenspannungers,"
Part II.


small works on the subject in America. Since Manderla's original article
the subject has been well handled by Engesser, Mueller-Breslau, Winkler,
Ritter, Mohr, Landsberg and others. These publications are available in
the larger libraries in the works of the writers themselves and in the files
of German technical papers. They are in the main theoretical treatments.
It is the purpose of the author to select what is best from these writers
and to so combine in the light of his own experience the various processes
as to render the whole available as a system of computation suitable for
use of the designing engineer in practice. Accordingly the writer has
not scrupled to modify or even abandon altogether portions which have
not conduced to this end conceiving that the ultimate warrant for this
is the fact that the method is for engineers, and for practical use. Those
interested in the more theoretical treatments are referred to Manderla's
article (see note at bottom of page 33, or to Engesser (part II Zusatz-
krafte und Nebenspannungen).
PHYSICAL ASPECTS OF DISTORTION IN A TRUSS.
It has been remarked that Captain Eads in some of the preliminary
investigations on the St. Louis arch resorted to the use of a piece of bent
steel or barrel hoop to simulate the distortion that took place in an arch
F~tgure J
under eccentric loading. A great deal of information may often be se-
cured by analagous means to show in a magnified way the physical de-
portment of any structure under strain, giving hints as to what sort of
analysis shall be applied in the Stress calculation. To do this in the
case of secondary stresses a small truss model may be arranged as in
Fig. 1. Here the individual members of the truss are each made of two
thin strips of some elastic wood or of steel which are arranged to slide
past one another and which may be clamped at any given position as
shown. In any actual truss the load is applied and causes direct stress
in each member. There is a small distortion in each member accompany-
ing the stress and which is gotten by the common expression of Hooke's


Law or A1 = p 1/E. If the model is clampel up to a configuration with-
out initial distortion, the length of any individual member may be varied
at will by slipping its two parts past each other in either direction to
suit, and reclamping. This may de done in the various members, thus
simulating the strained condition of an actual truss but in a highly exag-
gerated degree. Space will not permit of an extensive discussion of such
apparatus other than to outline the general effects for future mathe-
matical analysis.
In the foregoing truss model the longitudinal increment or decre-
ment of length of each member, which is supposed to represent the real
longitudinal strain of an actual truss member, causes a certain distortion
of the triangle elements composing the truss which is exhibited as a
small increment or decrement in each angle of every triangular element
in addition to that of the sides. Now in the general case the angles be-
tween each pair of members intersecting at a joint (and which in the
unstrained state of truss are the angles of the individual triangular ele-
ments) are maintained constant by reason of rigid connections to gussets.
In an actual truss this corresponds to the restraint caused either by gus-
sets or by pin friction.* Therefore after the truss is strained the mem-
bers, by reason of the restraints of gussets, must spring out from their
original positions to accommodate themselves to the changes in the angles
of truss elements. In general each member will be bent into a sinous
■curvt as is indicated in Fig. I. The effect of this on the joints is to cause
slight rotations, which in the figure are all shown as positive or contra-
clockwise rotations, the real directions being unknown until after calcula-
tion. Manderla's solution of course is to write stress relations for each
member expressed as a function of their corresponding strain relations.
STRESS AND STRAIN IN INDIVIDUAL TRUSS MEMBERS.
Fig. 1 is assumed for brevity of expression to represent the real
strain status in an actual truss. In order to analyze any member for
stress, it is isolated as a free body in space by passing sections perpen-
dicular to its axis at each end close to the joint. The member is in
-equilibrium by a direct or axial stress and a moment and shear at each
«nd, and a variable moment and shear at any intermediate section which
may be expressed as a function of the first values. The centroid line
* In an actual truss the moment due to pin friction is not always
sufficient to give complete restraint. There may then be a slipping of
bars around pin until equilibrium ensues. To investigate, however, com-
plete restraint must be assumed, and the moments found on this supposi-
tion be compared with those due to pin friction. An idea may then be
formed as to whether readjustment of bars around pin has actually
•occurred.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
of any member will also in general be non coincident with the axis of
member which axis after strain is the line connecting joint apices. Man-
derla's method is perfectly general in application, but the engineer in
order to render the method applicable to practical computation will treat
the various effects "partially" or separately resorting to the well known
principle of Theory of Elasticity called "superposition of effects" where-
by if a series of infinitesimal strains in a body are at one time given
as a, b, c, etc., and at another time a', b', c', etc., the final strains as a
close enough approximation are a +a', b + b', etc., and similarly for the
stresses induced. That is, the geometry of the figure under analysis is
not appreciably changed thru different applications of external forces or
while under stress.
A first and sufficient practical approximation in the calculation of
secondary stresses is to neglect the direct stress in any bar or member
and consequently that portion of the intermediate moment which is due
to the direct stress into any variable deviation y the elastic line may take
from axis of member as a result of its deformation. This effect may be
treated separately if desired and later added to subsequent calculations.
Any member of the truss considered as a free body for analysis is simply
a special case of the continuous girder with variable supports where there
are no transverse loads, and the member is under bending stress alone,
there being only one span 1. Howe gives general equations for the treat-
ment of this case (Continuous Girder, p. 17), but as Greene's Area Mo-
ments principle is of great utility in secondary stress problems, it will
be employed here. See Fig. 2. In the writer's experience, Engesser's
notation is the most advantageous to use for expressing the unknown
functions in these calculations; viz., each joint of truss is marked with
a numeral. Any member as 1—2, (Fig. 2), is in equilibrium under a
moment M12 and shear Sla at the origin or left end, and likewise M
and S21 at the distance 121 or right end. Other members have a similar
notation for moments, shears and other functions. Suppose the tangent
to elastic line at left end of member 1—2 is conceived to represent the
original unstrained position of that member. After strain point 2 has


its final position at a distance &gt;2l from that tangent. By area moments
any deflection desired, say 8 from some initial tangent t12 at the end
1 is gotten by taking the area of the bending moment diagram between
the points of tangency and deflection and multiplying it by the distance
of its centroid from the point where deflection is measured. This expres-
sion gives the deflection when multiplied by i/E I where E is modulus of
elesticity and I is moment of inertia for member in question. Expressed
analytically
'*.=
_ /"^Mi
Jo-(xI-x)d3
where (Mdx) (xt — x) is an element of area times its arm measured
along the axis toward the point distant xt where deflection is desired.
To integrate the above expression place the value of Mx, = moment at
distance x, in terms of x by taking summation moments =0 at sec-
tion x. There results Mx ■= M12— S12 x and since moments about right
end put equal to.o gives S12= (M12-f-M21)/l there results
MX = M12 1B_—^x
for the variable moment at the section distant x from the origin at
point 1. Now by substitution in the integral expression
(5X =~gY J [Mu ^-f—= x] (n — x) d x
If this expression is integrated between o and xt = 1 there results
8, = (2M12- MM) 1V6EI
and the value of deflection angle between end tangent at I and axis
!-* = V1
By an interchange of subscripts there likewise results the value t21 or de-
flection angle at right end = "— (2M —M ). By solving for
6 E I21
M12 and Mn the values of the end moments are obtained viz.:
'it
M2l = ^_W(2T21+Tl2).


The values t12&gt; t21. etc., are expressed in circular units or radians,
and are practically the same as sines or tangents of very small angles.
The moment at any point distant x from origin at I varies as a straight
line. There is in general a point of contraflexure, but not necessarily.
The moments if desired may be considered as due to two equal and oppo-
site forces, whose line of action is at an angle with the axis I—2 and
which passes thru the point of contraflexure or point of zero moment.
SIGNS OF FUNCTIONS.
In problems of this nature the questions of signs of functions is
always an important one. In this paper direct stress (which is only con-
sidered in the subsequent colculation of the strain in the truss) is given
the positive sign when tensile because the longitudinal deformation of
the member accompanying this stress is an extension or increase of length,
i. e., should be consistently called positive. Likewise the work done on
the member, which is sometimes used in calculation of secondary stresses,
being a function of positive stress times a positive strain is positive.
Writers often transgress in this respect, that is, are inconsistent.
In Fig. 2 the right hand moment is taken as positive when contra-
clockwise, because it causes the right hand deflection angle and the ordinate
y to elastic curve to increase or tend to increase when the moment in-
creases. Likewise the curvature which is the reciprocal of the radius of
curvature, and which in the calculus of curves is the second derivative
of the function y of elastic curve, is increasing. The moment curve is
positive from its limiting value M21 until the point of contraflexure is
reached. After it crosses the axis at this point it is negative, and the
various values mentioned are decreasing functions. The moment M at
the left end of member I—2 is accordingly negative as long as it is viewed
as a limiting case of M12—S12 x — Mx or a function of x and it is laid
off below the axis I—2. But if viewed as external to the member, under
the conditions of equilibrium previously given, the equal and opposite
resisting moment is considered and as in Fig. i the arrow is shown
pointing in a contra-clockwise direction. This equal and opposite external
moment causes a tendency to increase the angle between end tangent at
I and the elastic line just as the moment M12—S12 x causes this deflec-
tion angle to tend to decrease until point of contraflexure is reached when
the reverse ensues.
INVESTIGATION OF EQUILIBRIUM OF A JOINT.
Having investigated the conditions of a bar, any joint may be sim-
ilarly treated as a free body by passing a section around the joint at the
periphery of the gusset (or in the case of a pin connected truss close to
the pin) as shown in Fig. 3, for joint I.


If the centroid axes meet in a common point (as is usual in good
design) any particular joint as i is held in equilibrium by moments in-
duced by the bending of the respective members, and by other moments
due to the shears acting with lever arms "d" measured from the joint
apex. These moments and shears are equal and opposite to those at the
ends of members and resist the tendency of joint toward positive rota-
tion. Now in a first approximation the moments due to shears are neg-
lected because their arms are small relative to the lengths of members.
h &lt;*
m\Su'
J Mm
Any angular distortion of gusset around joint apex is assumed negligible
compared with the values of deflection angles at the ends of members.
Upon these assumptions there results for equilibrium of joint i, and also
for the remaining portion of truss:—
SM = M11+M„+M1(=o
where M*2, M]B and M14 are the moments acting on joint due to bars
1—2, 1—5, and 1—4 respectively. If these moments are expressed in terms
of deflection angles as previously obtained and the constant 2E is can-
celled from each term there results
¥-(* r12+r21)+^-(2 r15+r51) + £ (2r14+r41) =0.
*1S *1B *14
Equations of this form may be written for each joint, there being
as many terms as there are bars radiating from the joint. There are as
many equations in general as there are joints. For symmetrical truss and
loading one-half this number suffices. The symbolic expression for the
equation for any joint n, using the summation sign is as follows:
&lt;fc(2-+-))
where 1,,,/lna is the moment of inertia divided by length of member for
any member n—a radiating from joint n, Tna &gt;s tne value of the deflection
angle for any member at the joint n end and Tln is the deflection angle
at the opposite end of the bar in question or at the joint a, any joint
adjacent to n. The summation sign 5 denotes that an expression of the
form 1/1 (2 rn-|-Ta) is to be written in order for every member radiating


from the joint "n" in question, the result summed and placed equal to
zero. The summation notation is a sort of shorthand method of pro-
cedure after the manner of writers on the arch and least work, and it is
the writer's purpose to so use it, that the final equations may be written
directly by inspection and ready for solution, the solution being largely
mechanical so that it can be worked out by assistants on a calculating
machine.
RELATIONS BETWEEN DEFLECTION ANGLES.
It is obvious that if equations of the form just given are written
for each joint of the truss, that their solution gives the values of the
end tangents to elastic curve, t. e., the deflection angles, for every mem-
ber in the truss. If the values T are calculated the end moments result
from the expression
Mni=2E ^(2r„,+rJ
and having the end moments the intermediate Moment = Mr may be
determined. The stress in outer fibre results directly from the ordinary
beam equation or
Mr Moment
f = stress = =
I/e Section Modulus
To reduce these equations it is necessary first to show the relation
between the various deflection angles around any joint as n. This rela-
tion is readily made apparent by a little study of the strain geometry
of Fig. 4.
X.
The first deflection angle for joint 1 is t12. being the one farthest
to the right chosen as an initial or reference T. The relation existing be-
tween these deflection angles is as follows:—
r14=r12+(^ = o)
T15 = Tl*+ 215
TU = T1J 1 215+ 514-


41
In the above equations Ao, &amp;nl, and A5i&lt; represent the small angular
changes around joint 1 of triangular truss elements (212 = 0), 215, and
514. These angular increments are to be found later. It is seen that
any deflection angle is equal to an initial deflection angle plus the sum
of all intervening angular changes between the initial or reference mem-
ber and the member with deflection angle in question. Tl&lt; may be writ-
ten t14 = t 12+ 2 A J or Tlt= t12+a214. where \lt = the total angular
change that has occurred between members 1—2 and 1—4, and in gen-
eral language for any joint n this may be expressed
Tna = Tnl~T Ina
where Tna= the deflection angle at joint n for any bar n—a, Tni^ the de-
flection angle for the initial bar n—a, ». e., n—i, for joint n and AlM =
the total angular change which has occurred after strain between the mem-
bers n—i and n—a respectively. ,
THE DISTORTION OF A TRIANGULAR TRUSS ELEMENT.
It is comparatively easy, at least comparable with any of the deflec-
tion problems of a truss, to compute the values of the angular changes
around a joint of the truss. A number of excellent formulae are in exist-
ence for this purpose, but from the standpoint of the computer it is im-
portant that one should be chosen which is easy of application and at
the same time is direct and uninvolved, to avoid the accumulation of
errors of the various functions. Many of the proposed formulae while
interesting mathematically are not practicable as instruments of efficiency
for the computer
An excellent group of formulae may be gotten by either ordinary
or partial differentiation of the equation
Cos A = (b2 + c2 — a2)/2 be
where a, b, and c are the three sides of any triangle and A, B, and C are
the corresponding angles. By differentiating both sides and solving for
d A which for the computer's purpose is A A there results a relation
between the small increment (±) occurring in angle A as a result of the
small longitudinal increments (+, —) which occur in the sides a, b, and c.
Remembering that any infinitesimal change in the length of a side, say
da, is for the computer's purpose (paa)/E where p is the unit stress in
the member ,a is the length and E is the modulus of elasticity, and group-
ing terms there results:—
AA:
"h" ( (p.—Pb) cot c + (p.—Pc) «* B )


». e., E X the angular increment for any angle A of a triangular truss
element may be considered as made up of two terms each of which is
the difference of the opposite stress and adjacent stress into the cotangent
of the respective included angle. This equation has been used by En-
gesser, Mueller-Breslau, and Mehrtens. As the triangular truss elements
are usually repeated thruout the truss, it is usually sufficient to compute
only three of the angles of the truss and obtain their cotangents for use
in the formula. If the triangle is right angular, as is usual in parallel
chord trusses the work is still further simplified. When the several
angle increments have been calculated, a convenient check relation exists,
■viz.:—
AA + AB + AC'=0
since the three angles of a triangle add up to 180° before and after strain.
The writer has found by getting the total differential of an angle as equal
to the several partial differentials, assuming each side variable in turn
and the others constant (rigid members), that a series of equations re-
sult involving the squares of the sides, which are sometimes useful from
the computer's standpoint as the squares can be taken very conveniently
from Smoky's or Hall's tables. These equations are especially simple
for right angle triangles but it is not in the scope of this article to give
them, and the computer can easily derive for himself. Any angle incre-
ment can of course be gotten graphically by an elementary application
of Williot's diagram.
Having the values of the angle increments any deflection angle
around a joint is readily expressed in terms of its initial deflection
angle as previously shown, and if these substitutions are made in equa-
tions
«(^e *.+*.))
= 0
their solution by any convenient method will give the various values
of the deflection angles r- The other steps in the general solution can
be best illustrated by an actual problem.
SOLUTION OF PRACTICAL PROBLEM.
A simple truss is taken of the form as shown in Fig. 4, of span
40 feet, 4 panels, Warren riveted girder, height 10 feet, such as might
be used on an electric railway. The method of procedure will apply to
much larger spans, this one being taken to save space and time.
The data of this truss when loaded with a panel load of 40,000 lbs.
at each joint of lower chord, are given in the following table:

The primary stresses, sections, etc., are calculated statically as in
the ordinary manner. The joints on the diagram of Fig. 5 are num-
bered as shown and the various angle increments (+, —) are inserted
after calculation between the respective members on diagram. The cal-
culation of these increments are rapidly performed by equation for A A;
for example, the change in angle 215 at joint 1 results as follows:—
A215=i/30,ooo,ooo[ (—0400+7180) .500+ (—9400—13930) .750] =—.0006203
where 0.500 and 0.750 are the values of the cotangents of the angles 125
and 152 and, —9400, —7180, and + 13930, are the stresses per square
inch in members 2—5, 1—2, and 1—5 respectively namely the stress op-
posite the angle 215 and adjacent to angle 215 respectively. In a similar
manner all the other angle increments are obtained. For symmetrical
loading it is only necessary to calculate for one-half the truss. They are
s e
F/ffure &amp;
inserted in their appropriate places on Fig. 5 as is shown. The check
on the work is that the several increments of each triangular truss ele-
ment shall add up to zero; for example: —.0006203—.0003148-I-.0009351=0
(very nearly) for triangular truss element 215.
The next step in the process is to draw a diagram, Fig. 6, and lay
off the deflection angles as shown. These may be drawn at a convenient

acute angle to permit of sufficient space for the insertion of the various
values of t- This method of diagrams, the writer believes, is preferable
over some other proposed arrangements of computations as it appeals to
the eye directly, gives a graphical representation of what is being done,
and permits of easy checking in the bridge office routine. The values
of the various deflection angels are then inserted around each joint, the
initial T's being on right of joint for top chord and on left for bottom
chords. The other rs are expressed by adding the total angular change
to the initial T which has occurred between the initial member and the
member in question. For example, for joint I the first deflection angle
is Tln+° — t12. that is, member I—2 has zero angular deviation from the
initial member chosen. The second is r15=T12+'i215=r12—0.0006203; sim-
ilarly rlt=rlt+(.—.0006203)+0.000648=,-^—0.0005555 and likewise for all
the other joints as is indicated on Fig. 5.
The final equations ready for solution may now be written directly
from inspection of Fig. 6 using the equation 2f-22- (2 Tna+Ta,,) |=o for

Only the joints on one-half the truss are taken for symmetrical
loading. For other loading similar equations must be written in general
for all the joints.
In order to write these equations directly in their final simplified
form it will be observed by noting the form of equations and inspecting
diagram, Fig. 6, that t12 enters into the simplified equation for joint I
as follows:
^(2Ti2)+^(2ri2) + ^.(2Ti2)(

for the adjacent joints 2, 5, and 4 enter the reduced equation respectively

duced equation being 2.69 t28&gt; 1.12 tm&gt; and 2.41 t41. *■ e., in general no-

from joint 1 and taken in order and the t*\ is always the initial T of the
joints adjacent to I taken in order, viz.; joints 2, 5 and 4. The remain-
ing terms are involved in the absolute term of reduced equation for joint
1. This absolute term is made up of two sets of values. One portion is
2 Ilt/lls (.0) +2 I1S/115 (—.0006203) + 2 I14/l14 (—.000555)
and the other
I,Aa (+ -0016331) + I15/l15 (- -0007644) + 1^4 (•■•)
and if the respective values are taken for 1/1 the absolute term of reduced
equation for joint I is —.000525 as given. In general, therefore for
any joint n of the truss the general reduced equation is expressed directly
in the summation notation with the aid of a diagram such as Fig. 6, viz.
&lt;*)

where I^/l,,, is the moment of inertia divided by length of member for
any member n—a extending from any joint n to any respective adjacent
joint a: A,na is the total angular change or increment (±) that has
occurred about joint n between the initial reference member n—i and any
member in question as n—a; Tai ls the initial deflection angle for any
adjacent joint a; and AUa' is the total angular change which has occurred
about joint a between the initial reference member a—i and any mem-
ber in question aa', a' being any joint adjacent to a.


For actual use in writing off equations ready for solution the fol-
lowing form is convenient and simplified in notation, viz.: The equation
for any joint n is

where the first term is twice the sum of values 1/1 for every member
radiating from joint n into t„&gt; the literal part of each deflection angle
having its vertex at n: the second term simply a series of values of 1/1
into the literal part of the adjacent deflection angles respectively; and
the third term is a series of values.—1/1 into (2 An+Aa) where \ is the
numerical part of the deflection angle at the nth end of bar n—a and
Aa is the numerical part of deflection angle at the opposite or ath end.
Equation 1 in this notation before reducing is written as follows:—
[2(2.69 + 1-12 + 2.41) t12] + [2.69 T2g + 1.12 tm + 2.41 t41]
+ [2.69 (2X0 + .OO16331) + 1.13 •( 2(—.0006203) — .0007644 ^
+ 2.41-{2(—.0005555) + o}-]=o.
All of the work up to this point is readily performed with a slide
rule. The method of writing down equations in their final and reduced
form while involved in statement is quite mechanical in execution.
It will be found simpler to ignore the E in equations for angle
increments A, i. e., consider the increments A of all joint angles 30,000,000
times too large. Then likewise consider Et12 = T12 (instead of can-
celling E in summation equation), or in other words consider E = unity
in all equations, and correct after solution. The computer may try for
himself. The operation is omitted in a statement of the problem.
SOLUTION OF EQUATIONS.
In the last equation of group of linear equations the value of t65
may be eliminated directly since the truss and loading are symmetrical
in this particular problem. There results t65=—(t6B—.0026040) or
rK= .0013020
In a large number of equations it will often be expedient to render these
equations homogeneous in the usual manner but it has been omitted in
this calculation. The solution by any method is
t12= + .0003197
t23=— .0011380
t41=— .0002327
tm= + .0001492
t«b= + -0013020


These values are found by trial to satisfy the equations. If E had been
considered unity after the manner previously suggested then the values
of deflection angles given above would be multiplied by E = say 30,000,000
for the computed values on basis of E = unity.
SOLUTION OF THE UNEAR EQUATIONS.
The theoretical method for the solution of linear equations is that
of Determinants. While this suffices for symbolic representation, and
is efficient for a small number of equations, it is the writer's experience
that the treatment is not a practicable one for the solution of a larger
number such as will occur in the analysis and calculation of bridges of
long spans. The equations may often be solved by successive approxima-
tions, the terms with relatively small coefficients being taken as zero,
and values derived for the others on this assumption thus giving a first
approximation to their real amount. These quantities are then sub-
stituted and the other terms solved for a second approximation and so on.
The method used by the writer is to divide say four of the equations
respectively by the coefficients of their first terms. This may be done
by setting off on a Thacher slide rule the reciprocals of the first co-
efficients in turn and reading off the new derived coefficients, the co-
efficients of each first term in the resulting equations being depressed to
unity. One equation of each pair is then subtracted from the other giving
two new equations with the former first terms eliminated. The operation
is then repeated, another term being eliminated and similarly for all the
equations until a single deflection angle is obtained which may be sub-
stituted in previous derived equations giving other values, and so on.
When the computer has had a little familiarity with the calculation of
secondary stresses, he may vary the solution with the graphical method
proposed by Ritter (Anwendungen der Graphischen Statik, Part II, p.
183) or with approximate methods given by Engesser and others as is
usually done when these stresses are calculated. Grimm gives a num-
ber of problems where the stresses have been worked out which will
serve for check and comparison. It is convenient to first apply the cal-
culation to a truss of a single triangular element or of two or three
panels.
CALCULATION OF THE SECONDARY STRESSES.
The secondary stresses in the outer fibres at ends of members are
now gotten by substituting in the beam formula or
Mt a IE ,„ , . (

where I -4-1 is the modulus of section. In this manner all the end


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
stresses have been worked out and shown in their appropriate places on
Fig. 7, using vaues of £ given in table of data.
The formula for the variable moment at section x = Mx is to be
used for intermediate values of stress. If desired an expression for equa-
tion of elastic line is easily written showing the variable deflection y,
thus giving an approximate idea of the moment due to the direct stress
into this deflection. But in such cases Manderla's more exact solution
is to be used (See Engesser, Part II, page 126 et seq.). The above
solution has been made rather hurriedly for any actual case in practice,

and the values obtained have received only such checks as the writer
could find time to apply. The percentages of primary stress, however,
are approximately of such magnitudes as may be expected in a riveted
truss of this span, type and loading, namely, from 10% to 40 or 50%.
GENERAL REMARKS.
Manderla's method while here applied to the solution of a truss
is very general in its application to all forms of frameworks. Engesser
has applied it to floor systems, lateral bracing, cases of eccentric joints,
omission of members, portal and sway bracing, etc. In a great many
of the investigations of continuous girders, portal problems, and other
calculations which usually enter into the problem of secondary stresses,
the method of area moments offers great advantages in treatment.
Mohr's principle which is a sort of inverse statement of this is also very
efficient.


While the secondary stresses in some structures may be fairly low,
in others they may be exceedingly large. Wolfel relates the instance of
a trestle bent in which he measured these stresses with a Fraenkel ex-
tensometer and found some values 200% of the primary stresses. He
further says (Trans. Am. Soc. C. E., "Railway Bridge Design Discussion,
1892): "I remember the case of a suspension bridge where cables were
made of pins and eye bars. Experimenting upon them with Professor
Fraenkel's instruments we found compression in some of these bars when
a heavy steel roller passed over. A second instrument applied to the
other side of the bar showed the tension which we had figured propor-
tionately increased. We had a clear case of bending in our cable caused
by friction of the pin in the pin hole. The whole cable from the abut-
ment over the pier to the other abutment worked not only as a tension
member but at the same time as a continuous girder." In continuous
girders, swing bridges, and link suspension bridges such stresses may be
too high to permit of neglecting their investigation.
The importance of such investigations has always been maintained
by Professor Turneaure to whom the writer is indebted for his training
in structures and much of his interest along this line. He says (Trans.
Am. Soc. C. E., "Some Experiments on Bridges Under Moving Loads,"
1899), after a careful experimental test of many railroad bridges with
the Fraenkel extensometer, "It is doubtless true that secondary stresses
are often much greater than stresses due to the vibration of the structure
as a whole; and it is an open question whether more attention should
not be paid to this feature." His paper while mainly treating of impact
and vibration is interesting in showing that observed stresses on short
span plate girders differed with the computed stresses from a minimum
of 45% to as high as 180%. He suggested that the railway companies
make actual tests with the Fraenkel instrument with a view to obtaining
more precise data for the development of standard and typical designs
on their systems, as is since being done. The writer found when investi-
gating a 150 feet span railway bridge with Professor Turneaure's instru-
ment that the stress induced by pin restraint is always quite apparent,
as is also noticeable from a study of Grimm's data.
ELIMINATION OF SECONDARY STRESSES IN DESIGN.
When the designer has an appreciation of the causes which induce
secondary stresses he will endeavor to eliminate the conditions which
call them into play. The paper by Bender which has largely escaped the
notice of American engineers (Railroad Gazette, 1884), gives the follow-
ing suggestions (also see "Principles of Economy in the Design of Me-
tallic Bridges").


"The more nearly the structure is designed to contain the minimum
volume of material," or the flatter its deflection curve the smaller the
secondary stresses. Accordingly use deep trusses as is coming more and
more to be the practice.
The rigid members as top chords suffer more than the flexible eye
bars ,the heavier members carrying the brunt of the stress.
The more evenly the total angles of the joints are deformed, the
more evenly the secondary stress will be distributed. For this reason
parabolic girders would be preferable were it not that the average depths
of such structures are smaller than the practically admissable depths of
girders with parallel chords.
"The longer the distance between connecting points the smaller the
secondary strain will be." Therefore use long panels and avoid inter-
riveting of web members, redundant members, collision struts, etc.
As far as secondary stresses are concerned the diameter of pins
should be kept small as the moment due to pin friction varies approxi-
mately as the radius.
In the conclusion of his recent work on secondary stresses Grimm
suggests that engineers interested in the theory shall analyze trusses and
publish their results. With the hope that he shall make a small contri-
bution to a subject which is still abstruse and imperfectly known the
writer presents this paper.


SUBWAY CONSTRUCTION IN NEW YORK
By H. C. Hutchins, '03*, Engineer, Pubuc Service Commission.
In October, 1904, the main portion of the present subway in New
York was opened to the public. In many ways it is a very successful
piece of engineering construction, and as a result an average of 525,000
passengers are carried each day. Before the subway was opened, the
elevated and surface lines were uncomfortably crowded during the rush
hours. The subway relieved this congestion for a time, but now all lines
of travel are crowded, and more rapid transit lines are urgently needed,
not only on Manhattan Island but to different points on Long Island and
to New Jersey.
The growth of the city along lines of rapid transit has been mar-
velous, and is going on at a very rapid rate.
The Public Service Commission which has charge of the design and
construction of all rapid transit lines proposes the following new routes:
The Fourth Avenue and Bensonhurst line, which will connect with
the new Manhattan bridge through Platbush avenue to Fourth and out
this avenue to 40th St. where the line branches, one to Ft. Hamilton and
the other to Coney Island and Bensonhurst.
This line has been designed and contracts let for portions of the
route, but work has not been commenced on account of lack of funds on
the part of the city. This line is urgently needed to relieve the crowds
that cross to Brooklyn every day, and can be started as soon as the State
Legislature modifies the present laws regulating subway construction.
Another line that is needed at once is the Lexington Avenue line.
This line as planned will run from the Battery Park north on Church,
Vesey, Broadway, Irving Place and Lexington Ave., to the Harlem river.
Above this point it may continue as two branches on Jerome Avenue and
the Southern Boulevard. This line would pass through the central part
of Manhattan Island in practically a straight line and would have a greater
capacity than the present subway owing to new features in the design.
In order to connect the Manhattan and Williamsburg bridges a sub-
way loop line is now being built through Center St. and another line is
being planned through Canal Street to form a loop connecting the Man-
hattan bridge with all the rapid transit lines that run north and south
on Manhattan Island.
Other routes include the Seventh and Eighth Avenue lines, which
will eventually be needed to carry the traffic from the Bronx. All routes


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
mentioned come under the supervision of the Public Service Commission.
Another line which will connect the railway terminals and trolley lines of
Jersey City and Hoboken is the Hudson Company's route, with two tun-
nels at Christopher St., and two tapping the downtown district. Part of
this line is now in operation and the rest will be opened in a few months.
The type of construction to be used for the lines proposed by the
Public Service Commission will differ in many ways from that of the
present subway. The clearance for cars will be larger, allowing l5'-o"
headroom above the base of rail and greater width between track centers
so that wider cars can be used up to a maximum width of io'-6". Under
the new plans full size railroad cars could be run through the subway.
All the steel construction will be encased in concrete instead of
being left open as is the present subway. The tracks will run between
parallel walls not less than twelve inches thick which will be made with
suitable refuge openings for the workmen.
It is thought that the ventilation will be improved by having each
track enclosed by side walls, as the car will then act as a piston, pushing
the air out of openings in the walls and roof and drawing in fresh air at
suitable openings in the roof and at stations.
Another feature of the use of concrete walls is that the steel column
stresses can be figured at higher values as allowance is made for greater
stiffness of the columns due to the support given by the concrete walls.
In the side walls there are two pressures to be taken care of:—the direct
load due to the roof and the bending stress due to the pressure of the
earth and water against the side of the wall. Generally I beams are
used as columns in the side walls and are placed with the webs at right
angles to the line of the wall so as to best resist the bending stresses.
The allowable unit stress figured in the new designs is 25,000 pounds
per sq. in. on the steel when it is entirely encased in concrete, which is
not at all excessive when we take into account the distribution of this
direct stress into the concrete wall itself due to the adhesion of the con-
crete to the steel.
The center columns will be made of built up sections and made as
compact as possible so as to save space. Around all columns there must
be at least two inches of concrete.
The roof beams and girders when thoroughly imbedded in concrete
are allowed a maximum extreme fibre stress of 25,000 pounds per sq. in.,
as it is considered that a roof beam will have a part of its stress in com-
pression taken up by the concrete so that the combined effect allows the
steel to be figured at higher stresses than is customary.
The following table gives the allowable stresses per sq. in. as specified
by the Public Service Commission for the design of subways:

These stresses are higher than those used ordinarily for building and
bridge work.
The loads are assumed as follows: The Elevated or Subway train
shall be assumed as continuous at 2,000 pounds per lineal foot of each
track or as a local concentration of two adjacent motor trucks with axle
loads of 30,000 pounds each spaced at intervals of five, ten and five feet
apart.
The roadway load for subways shall consist of a uniform load of
300 pounds per sq. ft. of surface, or a local concentration of 150,000 pounds
on four wheels 12 ft. between axles and 8 ft. gauge.
Where concentrated loads are carried on subways they shall be
assumed to distribute through the earth at an angle of 45 degrees.
Centrifugal force shall be figured by the formula C = .020WD where
C = the centrifugal force,
W = the weight of the moving cars,
D = the degree of curvature.
The above loads are to be increased by the following formula to
produce the static equivalent: S = 125 — il/200oL — L2 where S= the
increase in percent, L = the length of the applied loading which produces
maximum strain in the member, not to exceed 1,000 feet.
The loads on the roof of a subway where there is not less than six
feet in depth between the ceiling of the subway and the surface of the
street pavement are taken as follows:


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Live load, per square foot 600 pounds
Dead load, including the weight of the pavement, pipes, earth
fill, street car tracks, and roof of subway 1000 pounds
Total 1600 pounds
For depths greater than this add 100 pounds for each additional foot.
An interesting feature of the new designs is the possible use of pipe
galleries above the roof of the subways to contain the water and gas pipes.
These galleries have not been used before to any extent and their advan-
tages and defects are problematical. The advantages include the accessi-
bility of the pipes for repairs, connections and inspection. The pipes can
be kept painted and therefore less subject to corrosion than when buried
in earth. The pipes would also have a more stable foundation on the
roof of the subway than when placed in an earth excavation which is
liable to settle and cause cracking and leakage of the pipes.
On the other hand, there is the danger of an explosion caused by
the leakage of gas from the gas mains which would be very dangerous
as there might be a whole chamber ten feet square and a mile long or more
filled with explosive gas which might be exploded by a careless work-
man's match or a lighted pipe.
The laying out of a subway route is necessarily a question of follow-
ing existing streets and avoiding the necessity of passing under buildings
and private property owing to the possible damage to them. The question
resolves itself into laying out routes with as little curvature as possible.
Owing to the street geography of New York frequent short curves are
necessary in the southern part of Manhattan Island until a subway reaches
a main avenue where it can straighten out. The width of the streets
varies and it is so narrow it is proposed to make the subway on two
levels running local trains on the upper tracks and express trains on the
lower tracks. This plan will be followed in the construction of the Lex-
ington Avenue line where the street is too narrow to admit of four tracks
on the same level.
Where the subway has to pass under buildings or private property
provision must be made in the design of the subway roof to support the
building columns of the present or future structure above it. As buildings
of ao stories in height are quite common in New York and as there is
a prospective revision of the building law limiting the height of structures
to approximately 20 stories the present designs are figured to carry direct
loads due to 20 stories of building above the roof. The floors of the
building are figured at 175 pounds per sq. ft.
The present subway was built, whenever possible, by the open cut
method which, while the cheapest, is a source of great discomfort to


property owners and stores along the route as the teaming and driving
must be necessarily interfered with. During the construction of the present
subway a great deal of complaint and dissatisfaction arose from this cause.
On this account the future subways are planned to be built by rather
direct tunneling processes or by timbering and planking so as to maintain
at all times the usual surface of the street. This method is much more
expensive than the open cut method but is much more satisfactory to
the general public.
In many places subways are subject to water pressure from the
water in the soil as the level of the subway is lower than the ocean level.
Where this occurs the side walls and bottom must be reinforced to take
care of this pressure. Where the pressure on the bottom is large, steel
girders are placed in the bottom with their ends connected to the ends
of the columns and are figured for bearing due to the column loads
upon them.
The subway must also be waterproofed so as to prevent water seeping
through the concrete. This is done on the bottom by first placing about
six inches of concrete on the bottom of the excavation, then several layers
of tarpaper or waterproofing felt above which are two thicknesses of
brick laid in asphalt mastic. On top of this concrete is again laid a few
inches deep and then the steel reinforcing or girders which are imbedded
in concrete. This waterproofing construction is carried up the sides to
a point three feet above the mean high water line.
In some places it is planned to carry the construction very deep
owing to intersecting subways placed on different levels so as to avoid
grade crossings. The intersection of the proposed subways at Canal St.
and Broadway will require a depth of about 55 ft. below the street, 42
feet of which will be below the water level. It is proposed to excavate
by means of caissons.
The Public Service Commission, which has charge of this work, is
composed of five commissioners appointed by the Governor of New York
state. Appointment to the Engineering department is subject to the
examinations held by the New York state Civil Service Commission at
Albany, N. Y. The Engineering department has charge of all designing
and inspection for subways now under construction and proposed. The
work is of a very interesting character as many new and unusual problems
in engineering have to be solved.


HYDRAULIC MEASUREMENTS IN THR AMERICAN
CHANNEL AT NIAGARA FALLS
Orro S. Zelner, '05, Junior Engineer U. S. Lake Survey.
The Niagara river carries a volume of flow of upwards of 200,000
cubic feet per second. The river is fed by Lake Erie as a reservoir,
which guarantees a practically uniform flow.
The fall from the level of the head of the rapids above the Falls to
the gorge below is 220 feet, and this fall with the great volume gives
almost unprecedented water-power conditions. Each cubic foot per second
has a potential of 25 theoretical horsepowers, and as the Falls are in the
heart of a region having large cities in its radius of transmission, the
water is for this reason of immense value for manufacturing purposes.
The development of water power is already established there, but
it was projected to use such a large quantity of water that it was thought
that the scenic grandeur of the Rapids and Falls would be impaired. The
Burton bill, restricting the use of water on the American side and in
addition restricting the transmission of electric current from Canada to
the American side, was passed in 1906, the object being not only to limit
diversion on the American side, but to limit the market for Canadian
power and thus remove one incentive to diversions on the Canadian side.
A study of the conditions arising from water diversions above the
Falls was taken up by the Lake Survey in 1906. Water gauges were set
at various points in the river, both above and below the Falls, to register,
in conjunction with a water gauge in Lake Erie at Buffalo, the range of
river fluctuations corresponding to the change of Lake Erie.
In 1875 the Lake Survey had made a determination of the crest lines
and a new survey was made in 1906 to note the upstream travel or
recession of the Falls.
During the fall storms of this year an elaborate series of photo-
graphs was also taken to show the appearance of the Falls, both the
Horseshoe and American, and the Rapids, for low water and for high
water.
The various operations of the Lake Survey from 1906 to 1908, in-
clusive, fill a large volume. This paper deals alone with work in the
American Channel.
Opinions as to the percentage of the river flow passing over the
American Fall varied greatly, estimates being given by engineers acquainted
with the river, that ranged from 10 to 33 1-3 per cent. Dr. Clark, State

Fig. 3.—American Falls from Goat Island


Geologist of New York, a man who had made a particular study of the
river for several years, is quoted from his talk at the hearing before
Secretary Taft in 1907, relative to the preservation of the Falls, as fol-
lows: "You understand, sir, that the American Falls are the delicately
adjusted Falls, and they represent not more perhaps than one-fifth of the
entire volume of the river." In Dr. Spencer's monograph on the science
of the Falls, published under his commission from the Geological Survey
of Canada, he expresses the belief that the mean depth on the crest of
the American Fall does not exceed 1.5 feet, and that the "volume of dis-
charge is reduced considerably below 9 per cent, perhaps as low as 6 per
cent, though probably the range may be between this and 8 per cent. At
7 per cent the volume would be about 14,000 cubic feet per second."
These percentages as expressed by Dr. Spencer approach most nearly
the true values of any published estimates up to that time, although Mr.
F. C. Shenehon, Principal Assistant Engineer of the U. S. Lake Survey,
predicted before the discharge observations were made that the flow would
be found to amount to not more than 6 per cent of the entire river dis-
charge.
The American Fall, including 65 feet between Luna and Goat
Islands, has a breadth of 930 feet. The barrier, which forms the first
cascade and determines the discharge of the channel, is about 800 feet
below the head of Goat Island, and here the river is reduced to a breadth
of about 425 feet.
The local water diversions that may have an effect on the American
Channel are made by the Niagara Falls Power Company and the Niagara
Falls Hydraulic Power and Manufacturing Company on the American
side, and the Ontario Power Company on the Canadian side. The effect
of the latter, however, has been debated as this intake is but a short
distance above the first cascade in the main river. The effect of the
diversions through the two intake canals on the American side is also
a subject of debate as it has been questioned whether the diversion above
acts simply toward denuding the American Fall, or whether it does not
actually, by lowering the level on the American side, draw water into
the American Channel also.
In July, 1907, work was begun on the American Channel by placing
a gauge at the Wing Dam, a little farther down than the Willow Island
gage of 1906. The Wing Dam gage was set approximately at the point
at which the Hydraulic Section would be later established, so that it would
be of use in connection with the discharge measurements of this channel.
To one who has not seen the rapids above the American Fall it would
be difficult to portray the turbulence of this water. However an idea can
be gained from the accompanying photographs and from the concep-


5


ion of what any stretch of water must be, falling 49 feet in a distance
of half a mile and traveling this distance over a bed badly broken by ledges
of rock that in many places project above the surface. Half way down
from the head of Goat Island to the crest of the Fall, the stream is
crossed by Goat Island bridge. The current is so swift and the bed so
rough at this point that violent eddies are formed which practically pre-
clude in measurement the use of current meters. The only available reach
for discharge work lies above the first cascade and about two hundred and
fifty feet below the head of Goat Island. The stream here is flowing
smoothly with an accelerating velocity reaching in places ten feet per
second.
The width between the rock wing dam and Goat Island is 470 feet
and the mean depth is about 3.1 feet. A survey of this vicinity was made
July 9, 1907, by Mr. Sherman Moore, Junior Engineer, and a hydraulic
section located. Between July 12th and 16th a wire rope % inch in
diameter was stretched across the channel, supported by horses 6 feet
high on the Wing Dam and on Goat Island. This rope occupied the
center line of the section. The line by which the wire rope was drawn
to place was put across by means of a box kite.
An attempt was made to sound the section, using a 30-pound sound-
ing weight, operated from shore by double lines and a carrier running on
the cable. It was found, however, that the stretch in the rope was so
great that the weight carried it below the surface. In tightening the rope
to overcome this difficulty it was broken and the weight, carrier, and con-
siderable line was lost. Owing to the pressing need of other surveys the
work was then dropped until later in the season.
In October the writer was transferred from work on harbor surveys
on Lake Michigan to hydraulic work on Niagara River in local charge
of Mr. Moore, and after making measurements of the flow of the Erie
Canal at Buffalo and assisting in taking discharge measurements of the
Niagara River from the International Bridge at Black Rock, was assigned
the task of finding the depths of the water at the crest of the American
Pall and determining the discharge through the channel.
The first work taken up was finding the depth of the water at the
crest of the Fall. As this is practically inaccessible, it was decided to do
the work by means of a special sounding float devised by Mr. Shenehon
for use in sounding stream areas that cannot be easily reached by boat
or otherwise. This float consists of a spruce rod I inch square and of
any given length thrust through a hole in a hemlock block 8 inches square
and 2 inches thick. About one foot of the rod projects above the block
and carries a small flag. The staff below the block is some even foot in
length. About one foot above the lower end is fastened a weight suffi-


cient to hold the float vertical in the water, if the depth is greater than
the length of the float from the block to the lower end, but not sufficient
to submerge the block.
For the soundings at the crest line the floats were started from
points on the lower side of Goat Island bridge. An observer at Prospect
Point read the angle of deflection of this float, just before it reached the
crest, by means of a small protractor held in the hand, threaded for every
ten degrees.
If the float was free the angle of deflection was zero. When the
lower end of the staff dragged on the bed of the river, the cosine of the
angle of deflection times the length of the submerged part of the staff
gave the depth.
At the instant the float reached the fall a signal flag was dropped
and a transitman, at some good view-point near Goat Island Bridge,
tracing the float with the telescope of his instrument throughout its pas-
sage down the rapids, read it in. The point of intersection of this plotted
angle and the crest line determined the position of the sounding.
An unmistakable record of each float was made, by both the instru-
mentman and observer noting the number of the float in its order, the
time of releasing from Goat Island Bridge and of its passage over the
crest, and the color of the flag it carried. As a further check on this
record the number of every tenth float was signalled from observer to
transitman.
It was very evident from the groupings of the soundings that the
floats were following the deeper parts of the rapids, and consequently
were giving depths in excess of the true condition. However, in areas
over which it was most difficult to send a float the water was so shallow
that its depth could be closely estimated with the eye.
As each sounding was made a gage was read by the observer at
Prospect Point to determine the surface elevation at that particular time.
Lake Erie was close to the mean summer stage during the time the sound-
ings were being made and at this stage the mean depth was about 1.7 feet.
At mean lake stage, 572.60, the depth would be about I lA feet. Several
floats for depths and velocities were sent through the secondary rapids
between Goat Island and Luna Island. A mean depth of 1.3 feet at mean
stage was found and a velocity of 5 feet per second. The discharge of
this section of the rapids is about 4 per cent of the flow of the American
Channel.
After completing the work on the crest the work on the hydraulic
section which had been previously located, was again taken up. A second
survey of the section was made and by a small triangulation system,
range poles were set on both sides of the stream, fifty feet above and fifty

feet below the center line of the section, making a base ioo feet long
(see Plates I and 2), within the limits of which the entire area was to be
sounded and over which velocity floats were to be timed. It was decided to
use the float method of sounding on this work also, and with this program
the cable necessary would be used only as a line from which to start
sounding and velocity floats. It was thought advisable to place the cable
way about 60 feet above the section, thus enabling the floats to gain their
equilibrium in the current before reaching the upper range.
Profiting by the experience gained from the work in July, it was
evident that the J^-inch wire rope was not of sufficient strength, especially
when towers of but 6 feet height were used. In order to reduce the
strain due to the small allowable sag, the height of the towers was in-
creased to 16 feet. The tension in the cable due to its weight alone would
be about 425 pounds, and although no considerable load was expected to
be placed upon it, enough strength must be provided to take care of any
load due to accumulated ice, or the heavy pull that would result should
the cable be caught in the current. From these considerations a 9/32-inch
Swedish iron cable with a breaking strength of about 2,500 pounds, was
decided upon.
On the morning of November 27, with a fair wind blowing from
Goat Island to the American side, a box kite was sent up carrying a
strong seine twine as a kite string. Four hundred feet from the kite a
400-foot drop line of the same material was attached, which the men on
the American side succeeded in getting hold of as the kite reached a posi-
tion a short distance inland. An attempt was then made to lead a double
line across by this single cord, but the trial was a failure due to the lines
being caught in the current. A second trial with the kite in a treacherous
wind resulted in its loss over the falls. A third attempt was made with
a large flat kite, but it could not be induced to carry the heavy load and
that type of kite was abandoned. Another hastily constructed box kite
five feet high with a cross-section Ij4 by 2 feet, carried a line across at
noon, November 28, and by that line a double seine twine was led across
the channel and in turn a J4-inch rope, a 5^-inch rope, and finally the
cable was drawn to its place across the channel.
A transit station for cut-off angles was established on a jutting point
of Goat Island 500 feet below the section from which a clear view of
both the starting cable and the lower range was obtained. Pointings were
computed for intervals of ten feet on the cable.
A simple but efficient carrier operated by a J^-inch rope from each
shore, ran on the cable. It was made of a small board 4 inches wide and
18 inches long, with a grooved wheel at either end. The tripping device
for attaching the floats consisted of a common harness snap attached


horizontally to the lower side of the carrier. Leading from this snap to
shore was a strong light line by means of which the snap could be pulled
open when desired, and the float dropped at any given point along the
cable. The sounding floats were of the same form as those used on the
crest line. To the lower end of each float was attached a loop by which
it was hooked into the snap on the carrier and in this way moved out
over the river to any desired point as determined by the cut-off transit
Then it was released by the tripping line. As the cable was from four
to twelve feet above the water, to prevent breaking the stems on the rocky
bottom, the floats were always dropped upside own.
At least two sounding floats were started from each ten-foot point
on the cable. As each float crossed the base, the observer running parallel
to it on the Goat Island bank, read its inclination from the vertical by
means of a small protractor held in his hand. The inclination of the float
was observed at the upper limit of the section, the one-third range, the
two-thirds range and on the lower limit of the section. As the float
crossed the latter line a signal was given to the transitman who read
a cut-off angle, which, with the position of the float when ready for
release on the cable, gave the path of the float. The floats were made
of various lengths, even as long as six feet, before it was known that
there was no water on the section approaching that depth.
Floats that showed a deflection from the vertical of thirty degrees
or more were replaced by a shorter float and the soundings redetermined,
it being evident that with a considerable deflection the float block presented
such a large area to the swift water at the surface that the lower end
of the float was probably pulled off the bed of the stream, thus giving
a higher deflection and a too small value for the depth. As a rule there
was no question in the mind of the observer as to whether the floats
were touching bottom or not, for when dragging there was a characteristic
jerky motion that was unmistakable. Results were plotted after each
day's work and all doubtful soundings were checked on the following
day. To make sure that the inclination and this motion were due to the
float actually touching the bottom and not to eddies near the bottom,
several three-foot floats were sent through areas where four-foot floats
had shown 3.2 to 3.8 feet depth, and in all cases the 3-foot floats passed
over these places exactly erect.
The method of recording each float was much the same as that used
in the work at the crest line. The floats were numbered in their order,
and the time that each left the cable was set down by both the observer
and the transitman. Red, white and black flags were used and the color
of the flag each float carried was recorded. As a further check, as each
tenth float was observed the number was compared.


The velocity work was carried on in much the same manner as the
soundings, the main difference being in the type of float used. By experi-
ments it was found that a very simple practical float could be made by
weighting a two-foot length of lath by attaching on each side of one end
a 6od spike. Such a float with the wood well dried was found to float
vertically with only about one to two inches exposed.
In the discharge measurements the stream was divided into fourteen
panels or sub-streams, each about 40 feet wide at midstream, but narrower
at the sides. (See Plate 2.) A series of floats was directed through each
panel, as nearly the center as possible. Near the shore in two feet of
water or less, surface floats were used. One complete discharge measure-
ment consisted of fourteen velocity floats released from such points on
the starting cable that they would thread the middle of each panel. The
time occupied by each float in traversing the section was determined by
means of a stop watch and this time in seconds divided into 100 feet, the
length of the base, gave the velocity in feet per second. The paths of
the velocity floats were determined in the same way as were the paths
of the sounding floats. In all, twelve discharge measurements were made.
Although it is not the purpose of this article to go beyond a descrip-
tion of the work actually necessary in getting the required data for a
determination of the discharge of one particular stream, it would not be
out of place to describe briefly the general method of making the reduc-
tions after the data has been obtained.
It is understood that the hydraulic section of a stream is a vertical
plane perpendicular to the direction of the current. Soundings are taken
at frequent intervals from bank to bank along this plane, to develop the
profile of the bottom (see Plate 2). The area between the bottom and
the water surface is the cross-sectional area. For purposes of volume
measurement the river is conceived to be divided into a number of sub-
streams flowing side by side, the conditions in the channel determining
the width of each of these sub-streams. For each sub-stream the velocity
is measured by meter or float along a vertical line down the middle.
When meters are used, the veolcities are taken at every tenth of the depth.
At some fixed percentage below the surface, as the 4/10 depth is the con-
trolling current measuring point called the index. All velocities on any
vertical are referred to this index. In the work on the American Chan-
nel with the velocities being determined by floats, no thorough measure-
ment of the vertical distribution of the velocities could be made. How-
ever, by starting floats of various lengths simultaneously with the standard
velocity float the relation between the speed of a standard two-foot float
and a surface float was determined. It was found that the surface float
gave velocities about two per cent higher than the standard float. The


accompanying vertical curve shown in Plate 3 was taken from results
obtained in a channel very similar to the one under consideration. The
vertical velocity coefficients for the American Channel were derived from
this curve. To do this the percentage depth to which the float reached
was found from the profile and the relation of the mean velocity as shown
by the float for this percentage depth, to the total mean velocity on the
vertical is taken. This relation is the vertical velocity coefficient. The
plotted curve showing velocities at various distances across the section,
for index depth, is called the transverse velocity curve. (See Plate 2.)
In each panel or sub-stream the mean of the velocities along this curve
divided by the velocity at the index is the transverse velocity coefficient
For each sub-stream, the volume of flow is the product of the cross-
sectional area times the index velocity times the vertical and transverse
velocity coefficients. The total volume of flow for the river is the sum
of the volumes in all the sub-streams.
Inside the rock wing dam several sounding and velocity floats were
run. The discharge was found to be only about 180 cubic feet per second
of which 120 cubic feet finds its way into the river over the spillway and
the remaining 60 cubic feet passes down the canal inside of Willow Island.
During the time the twelve discharge measurements in the American
Channel were being made, the mean elevation of Lake Erie was 57240
feet. For this stage of Lake Erie the volume of flow in the Niagara
River is 205,500 cubic feet per second, and the flow in the American
Channel is 4.83 per cent of this, or 9,920 cubic feet per second. For mean
Lake Erie stage of 572.60, the flow through the American Channel is
roundly 10,000 cubic feet per second.

SIX YEAR COURSE IN ENGINEERING AND ARCHI-
TECTURE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
There are ever increasing collegiate advantages and requirements,
to meet the ever increasing needs of the individual graduate in his life
work. One of these advantages is the new six-year course, outlined after
long deliberation by the Engineering Faculty and approved by the Regents
at their May meeting.
This course is not intended to supplant the old four-year course,
but to be entirely optional, according to the needs or inclination of the
student. It has been planned first of all to give a broader and more
general training than it is possible to include in the present four year
courses, and at the same time a more thorough preparation in the tech-
nical branches for those who intend to follow engineering as a profession.
It is'also arranged with a view to meeting the requirements of stu-
dents who plan to take an engineering course as a preparation for a busi-
ness career, and who do not therefore wish to meet the specific require-
ments laid down for those expecting to become designers of new con-
structions. For such students the sixth year would be omitted.
The course is further arranged to provide for the very large number
of young men who enter the engineering schools without a clear idea
of the nature of the work, and oftentimes lacking both in preparation
and the natural gifts to insure success.
The first four years provide a broad general training in the arts and
sciences, together with a sufficient amount of technical instruction to
enable the students to discover whether or not they may profiably con-
tinue in Engineering, and to provide them with such training in survey-
ing, draughting, analytical chemistry and shop work as will enable them
to earn a fair compensation as draughtsmen, instrument men, analysts,
inspectors of construction, etc.
During the fifth year a considerable portion of the time is devoted
to the study of Law and Political Economy with particular reference to
the requirements of genreal business, as well as of engineering; at the
same time the more technical work of Strength and Resistance of Mate-
rials, Hydraulics, Machine Construction, and Metallurgy are taken up.
In the sixth year the higher branches of professional training, design
and original investigation, and the application of the theoretical principles
to practical problems are presented.
During the first three years the work of all the students is the same,
except for two minor substitutions in the third year by students in Chem-


ical Engineering and Architecture, so that except for these two branches
it is not necessary for the student to determine which line to pursue until
the end of the third year. At that time the work of the Summer Session
is differentiated for the several ultimate degrees.
In their fourth year and preceding Summer Session, the technical
subjects of Heat Engines, Electrical Machinery, Structural Mechanics,
General Mechanism, Surveying, Chemical Analysis and Elements of
Architecture are introduced.
The course leads to the degree of Master of Civil, Mechanical,
Electrical, Chemical, Marine, or Geological Engineering or of Architec-
ture, and includes at the end of four years the degree of Bachelor of
Science in preparation for Engineering or for Architecture, and at the
end of five years ot the degree of Bachelor of Engineering or of Archi-
tecture.
The time required for the first degree, "Bachelor of Science, in
preparation for Engineering or Architecture," is four University years
and one Summer Session of eight weeks, in which time the student is
expected to complete 140 hours of University work, of which 106 are
common to all seven courses. An hour of University work is defined as
the equivalent of one hour per week of recitation for one-half of the
college year. Three hours of time in the draughting room, laboratory or
shops, count in general as one hour in recitation.
For the second degree, "Bachelor of Engineering," another year of
University work is required, bringing the hours up to 17s, of which ill
are common to all. For the third or ultimate degree of Master of the
particular branch pursued, a sixth year is required, the number of hours
amounting to 210. In addition to the ill hours which are common to all
students, there are 24 more, making a total of 135, which are common to
the Civil, Mechanical, Electrical and Marine Engineering Courses.
The following table shows the number of hours common to the
several courses considered in pairs:

EDITORIALS
The Board takes pleasure in presenting the first issue for 1909. We
trust that it will meet with your approval. The number will probably be
found to be somewhat smaller than some of the preceeding ones, but
we believe that it makes up in quality, what it lacks in quantity.
We wish that the Engineering alumni would consider more than
they do that the Technic is their magazine. The board has always
found the alumni willing to help, when they are reminded, but a reminder
has generally been necessary. We are always glad to receive suggestions
and contributions that you think will be of interest to Michigan alumni
and undergraduates.
The editors wish to thank the advisory board for the valuable sug-
gestions that they have given us. We also wish to thank Dean Cooley,
Professor Allen and Mr. Bird for the aid that they have rendered.
Work has been started on the addition to the Engineering Building.
The part of the naval tank that extends beyond the main building will
be built up to the height of the rest of the building. At the end of the
present naval tank, an entirely new wing will be constructed. 60 x 130
feet, which will also be of the height specified above. Excavatng is being
done so that at some future time the naval tank can be extended sixty
feet. This will allow the testing of ship models at higher speeds.
The electrical laboratories will be moved to the new wing, relieving
the present cramped conditions in this department, and affording an op-
portunity for a better arrangement. The rest of the addition will be
occupied by an auditorium, offices, class rooms, and drawing rooms. We
hope to give a more detailed account of this in our next issue.
The Technic is supported almost entirely by its advertising. We
hope that our readers will favor the firms that help us. When you write
to them, mention the Technic. It will be a great help to future business
managers.

ENGINEERING WORK AND THE PEOPLE
Clarence T. Johnson, '95 State Engineer of Wyoming.
There has been a marked change, during the past twenty years, in
public appreciation of the engineer and his work. There are numerous
causes for this. In the first place, our universities have provided spe-
cial training for engineers who desire to devote their lives to a single
branch of engineering. This fits the graduate with the tools of a
specialist. Engineering training covers a wide field and even the course
which is planned to turn out specialists opens the way for a further
subdivision of the science. We have civil, mechanical, electrical and
chemical engineers from nearly every school and there are courses given


in marine engineering and in many allied branches at the larger insti-
tutions. The groundwork of the course of study is much the same for
all engineers and if the student fails to secure this initial training prior
to his graduation, he must perfect himself in the school of experience
thereafter. The growth of the engineering profession has opened a
new chapter in the political and social history of the country. We
have men prepared by a special training to do things.
It was only a few years ago that law, medicine and the ministry
embraced all professions. Even medicine did not nourish as a scien-
tific profession until chemistry, etiology and other sciences placed it on
a more secure footing. Law and theology both developed with the
growth of the human race. Both probably contained and still contain
many things that science must correct. We see in the "new thought"
an effort to harmonize religion with scientific truths. The common law
of England which we borrowed has been eliminated in so far as it re-
lates to water in many of our Western States. The engineer has been
responsible for many of the laws that have been enacted by state legis-
latures and even by Congress, relating to development and to technical
questions generally.
In this brief paper I wish to impress upon the engineers who read
the Technic that our profession is not solely of a selfish and personal
character. We are not going out among the people to get their money
in return for our services. The engineer has but recently taken a hand
in the important movements of our age. His place is secure, but his
responsibility is great. His success must be measured not by money
or honors. He has a work now that has been complicated by
centuries of tradition. The engineer in his relations to the public,
must base his recommendations upon the truth as it appears to him
today. We have been restricted too long by theories and principles that
have been established by precedent. While this condition is generally
recognized by students of science and political economy, yet it may be
well to make an illustration. I shall refer to a subject that has been
somewhat closely related to my work during the past fourteen years.
It is probably understood by engineers generally that the English
Common law has been accepted by the United States wherever it ap-
plies. This law embraces the doctrine of riparian rights relating to the
waters of streams. This doctrine gives to those whose lands border on
streams the right to demand that the waters of such streams shall pass
their holdings undiminished in quantity and undefined in quality. Such
a doctrine operates to the satisfaction of all in such a country as
England. It applies to the humid portion of the United States. Where


water is used for the purpose of irrigation no such theory can be car-
ried into effect. Regardless of this, we have had great difficulty in break-
ing away from the old English law custom. Four or five western
states, where irrigation is essential to the prosperity of the farmer, are
still struggling with riparian rights. Wherever this condition is found
it is an evidence that the engineer has failed in his mission. To make
practice and theory harmonize out of doors, the theory has in some
places been modified, but those who hold to tradition, still claim that
riparian rights must be maintained. That doctrine has been abrogated
in Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, Idaho and other states.
The West unconsciously shouldered a great responsibility when it
undertook the supervision of streams. As the demand for water in-
creased disputes naturally arose among users. This condition required
immediate steps to be taken by some public authority to prevent neigh-
borhood quarrels and blood-shed. The streams of California were first
diverted by white men for placer mining purposes. No state government
had been established when some of these conflicts occurred. When state
courts were available, and these were instituted long before any admin-
istrative office could be created, the people interested resorted to them.
This immediately laid a foundation for supervising engineering problems
in accordance with the English common law principles. New ideas
were presented to the courts from time to time and each judge had his
own convictions. As irrigation developed and as the problems relating
to the division of the available water supply became more complicated,
cases in the courts increased. It is pitiful to the engineer to follow this
litigation. Single cases have been continued for years. "Temporary
injunctions" have been in effect for over twenty-five years. To afford
the individual relief from such a condition, large companies were
formed and irrigation districts naturally had their birth. These war
among each other, but the individual is only affected indirectly. The
State failed to assume the responsibility that was naturally its own.
The national government does not assume authority over non-navigable
streams. Unless the State accepts this duty, some less competent author-
ity, must in time do so. Other states naturally fell into the errors of
California.
The irrigators of the West obtained no great relief until an engineer
assisted by his scientific and practical associates laid the foundations for
a state administration that would supervise these matters of an engineer-
ing nature. Wyoming led in this movement. Elwood Mead, a graduate
of Purdue, prepared the provisions relating to the control of the waters
of the state as the same ar incorporated in the state constitution. He


followed this work by drafting the statutes based on the constitutional
provisions. He spent ten years in administrative work under that law.
The experience of Prof. Mead and his successors has not been altogether
pleasant. The history of this reform has been that of a continuous
warfare. The lawyer who has studied conflicting court decisions of other
states without knowing much concerning the practical phases of water
problems has naturally been opposed to many of the principles that the
engineer has advocated. Regardless of this, reforms have come and
other States have followed the leadership of Wyoming. Our laws have
even been accepted in Alberta, Canada and many of our irrigation princi-
ples are recognized today in Australia, India and Egypt.
The engineer of today cannot limit his work to the technicalities
of the profession. He must find the truth and apply it. His field
is much broader many times than that of his employers. His training
must teach him to recognize those principles which, when incorporated
into public rules, will afford protection to all individuals of the com-
munity in which he lives. When he has discovered such a principle he
must have the stamina to stand for it through all storms and tribu-
lations. This, I believe, is the mission of the engineer.


THE TRANSMISSION OF TELEPHONE CURRENTS
By Sergius P. Grace, '96, General Supt. of Plants—
The Central District and Printing Telegraph Co., Pittsburg., Pa.
In the transmission of telephone currents over a wire circuit we have
to deal with the resistance, the inductance, the distributed capacity,
and the leakage conductance of the circuit. Since telephone currents
alternate from 100 to 2,000 times per second, the difficulty of obtaining
a sufficient quantity of electricity at the far end of a long circuit to
properly operate the receiving telephone apparatus can easily be ap-
preciated. If we had to deal with the resistance of a telephone cir-
cuit alone, and the capacity and self-induction were absent, the cur-
rent received at the far end yould be strictly proportional to the resis-
tance of the circuit. However when distributed capacity is cpmbined
with line resistance and the self-inductance is very small, the waves
of current are rapidly attenuated and besides distorted, for the higher
frequencies corresponding to the overtones of the human voice will not
be attenuated at the same rate as the lower frequencies and therefore
the received speech will be of small volume and unintelligible.
When the inductance and the capacity of a circuit are in lumps and
an alternating voltage is impressed the mean current
B
(i) 1 =
-Jr* + |a»rf L, |
'\ a *■ f c/
in which E=volts, R=resistance, f—frequency, c=capacity and L=self-
induction.
An examination of this formula will show that for a given fre-
quency it is possible to so proportion the capacity and self-inductance of
a circuit that their combined effect upon the current amplitude is zero.
This principle' of electric resonance can not be made use of in tele-
phone circuits because the capacity is distributed instead of lumped.
In the case of a very long electric circuit to one end of which an
alternating voltage is applied, we do not have a direct transmission of
energy over the circuit since the voltage at the transmitting end may
reverse before the current we have set up by the preceding impulse has
had time to reach the distant end. The energy supplied by the trans-
mitting generator is propagated along the line in the form of an electro-


magnetic field and an electrostatic field. If there is a large amount of
distributed capacity present in a circuit possessing series resistance,
current must first be supplied to charge this circuit and this wave of
charging current will progress but slowly along the line. The tele-
phonic transmission of electrical energy over a circuit takes the form
of a wave propagation. Hence the remarkable condition exists that, in
a long telephone circuit, say from Boston to Omaha, at different points
the currents at the same time may flow in opposite directions and the
E. M. F.'s be in opposition.
It is timely at this moment to examine the electrical laws that
govern the transmission of electrical energy over long circuits con-
taining resistance, self-inductance and capacity. The following two
formulae for the wave length constant and the attenuation constant in
circuits of this character have been known for some time. For cir-
cuits having negligible leakage conductance they are as follows:
Wave Length Constant.
(2) a = JiPC(v/P*L8-r-R8 + PL)
Attenuation Constant.
(3) b= JiPC(i/P»L* + R» —PI,)
The attenuation factor is the measure of the amplitude of successive
waves, or the ratio of the volume of the current in one section of the
line to the volume in the preceding section. In the above equations
L=self-induction of the circuit per mile in henries; C=the mutual ca-
pacity of the circuit per mile in farads; R=resistance in ohms; P = vr
times T, where T is the period of the impressed electro-motive force or
the number of vibrations per second of the transmitter diaphragm.
If we let the length of a wave be represented by K, we may write
the formula:
(4) K = 2 ir/a
Also if we let I=the current at the beginning of a long line, at any
other place, s, along the line, the current will be given by the formula:
(5) Is = le-bs
where e is the base of the Naperian system of logarithms, or 2.718
and e—bs is the attenuation factor for the line of length s. From
equation No. 5 it is evident that in order to increase the received cur-


cent at the far end of a long telephone line we must seek to reduce
the value of the attenuation constant, b. An inspection of equation No.
3 will show us that this can be done by increasing the self-induction,
L, of the line. When the self-induction or electromagnetic inertia of
the line is increased, energy can be stored in the inductance and suc-
cessively propagated along the line. Energy can be stored in this way
with small currents and therefore those dissipation losses of energy
which are proportional to the current, are materially reduced. Looking
at it from one point of view, loading or increasing the self-induction
produces in effect, a high voltage transmission system.
Some early attempts were made to apply this formula to practice
by introducing into long telephone lines a series of inductances. These
attempts all failed because the inductance coils were not properly dis-
tributed and gave rise to reflection losses. The results were worse than
if no self-induction had been added to the line. It is, of course obvious,
that if the self-inductance could be evenly distribu'ted along the wire it
would produce a highly beneficial result; but in practice this can not be
done economically and if we are to increase the self-induction of a line, it
must be placed in the form of coils in lumps. It remained for the math-
ematical genius of Dr. Pupin, Professor of Electro-Mechanics in Columbia
University, to point out that inductance coils, in order to reduce atten-
uation in long telephone circuits, must be so spaced that the distance
between them in the circuit should bear a certain relation to the mini-
mum wave length to be transmitted over the circuit.
In Dr. Pupin's paper read before the American Institute of Electrical
Engineers he gives the following formula:
(6) 0/2Jr = k/K or tf&gt; = 2 7rk/K
In this equation k represente the distance between successive coils and &lt;P
the angular distance between them if 2- is considered as the angular
distance of a complete wave length. Dr. Pupin showed that a line hav-
ing loading coils distributed along it would attenuate the transmitted
current in the same manner as a uniform line with the same total in-
ductance, resistance and capacity, to the same degree of approximation
that:
Sine of angle &lt;t&gt;/2 = &lt;t&gt;/2
If these quantities are equivalent within two or three per cent, a
loaded line will attenuate the transmitted current the same as a uniform
line within this percentage of variation.
In practice it has been found that if the shortest wave length to
be transmitted passes as many as 7,000 coils per second, the loaded line


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
approximates sufficiently close to a uniform line. It has also been
observed that it is not necessary to load for periods of the human voice
exceeding 1,000 vibrations per second, which would seem to indicate
that the highest over-tones or harmonics in the human voice are rela-
tively unimportant so far as the intelligibility of the received speech
is concerned. In Fig. 1 is shown a diagram of a line equipped with
loading coils. These coils consist of insulated copper wire wound around
an iron core.

Besides reducing the attenuation there is another great gain to be
obtained from loading. When the inductance of a circuit is considerable,
formula No. 3, for the attenuation constant, reduces to the simplified form
of:
(7) b = R/2 V C/L
which shows that the attenuation is independent of the frequency. Prac-
tically this means that the telephone currents corresponding to the over-
tones or harmonics of the human voice, as well as the fundamental fre-
quency, are all transmitted with equal attenuation so that their relative
amplitudes are preserved at the receiving end of the line. This improves
very materially the articulation or intelligibility of the received speech.
The formula for the wave length, when the inductance is high com-
pared with the resistance, may be written in the simplified form of:
(8)
a = P yXC
Having now considered the theory of loading it is in order that
we should ask, what are the results that can be obtained by loading a
cable or overhead telephone line? In the first place let us consider the
results obtained by loading a standard 19 gauge conference cable. The
cable known as conference cable, was used by all Bell Telephone Com-
panies to within a few years ago, for practically all purposes. This cable


is made of 19 gauge wire

can therefore say that the equivalent of one mile of conference cable
is 30 miles of No. 8 B. W. G. copper wire, 12 miles of No. 12 N. B. S-
copper wire, and 8 miles of No. 14 N. B. S. copper wire.
In Fig. 2 are shown curves of transmission equivalents of 19 gauge
unloaded and loaded cable. The added inductance in this case is .0985
henries per mile. With this amount of added inductance, and assuming
no terminal reflection losses, the transmission efficiency, of 100 miles of
loaded cable will be the same as 33.7 miles of unloaded cable. The
attenuation constants of the unloaded and loaded cables are .109 and

.0367 respectively. Their ratio is .337. The wave length constant for the
highest frequency considered (800) would be for the loaded line
a = P v/LC = .36.
The wave length would therefore be:
2 ir/a =2 T/.36 = 17.5 miles.
Since the coils in this example are placed 1J4 miles apart, there would be
ten coils per wave length and the velocity of propagation of the wave
17.5 times 800 or 14,000 miles per second. The wave would thus pass
8,000 loads per second.
In Fig. 3 are shown curves of relative current in 19 gauge loaded
and unloaded cable. In this case the cable is heavily loaded with .6
henries per mile. Curve No. 2 shows the attenuation with no terminal
taper to reduce the reflection losses. In practice terminal tapers, terminal
transformers or short lengths of unloaded line are used to keep reflec-
tion losses at a minimum.
There are now in use in the United States by the Bell Telephone
Companies, many thousands of miles of loaded lines, both in cable and
open wire. These lines are from 3 to 4 times as efficient for speech
transmission as similar unloaded circuits. Besides reducing the circuit
cost for required transmission between two points, loading also enables
us to greatly extend the range of telephonic communication and in a few
years there will probably be no place in the United States so remote
that it can not be reached by the telephone.

EXAMPLES OF GRAPHICS IN REINFORCED
CONCRETE DESIGN
E. P. Goodrich, '98, Consulting Engineer.
In many points with regard to the design of reinforced concrete
structures, graphical methods can be employed to great advantage, com-
passing a material saving of time and cost of engineering, and possessing
a much higher degree of accuracy than can be attained in the execution
of the work.
The Germans are much more given to the use of graphical analysis
than are American engineers and are exceedingly clever in devising new
methods and applications. The majority of those hereafter described are
due to their ingenuity.
Almost everyone is familiar with the graphical method of determining
the lengths of cover plates for the flanges of plate girders by the use of
a parabola upon which are superposed rectangles of proper thickness to
represent the total stress carried by each plate. The length of a rover
is determined by the length necessary to just cover the parabola at an
ordinate corresponding to the total stress carried by all deeper covers.
Similarly, the points may be determined at which the reinforcing rods of
a concrete beam may be stopped off or bent diagonally upward to assist
in resisting diagonal tensile stresses or to reach the new zone of tension
over the supports of continuous members. The diagram of Fig. 1,
shows how a simply supported beam reinforced with four rods can have
them arranged. They are shown at four levels in the beam elevation
only for the sake of illustration.
In a beam with ends rigidly fixed, the arrangement shown in Fig 2,
is typical.
With partial or moving loads, the moment curves change in shape
and in the location and amount of the maximum moment. These chang-
ing curves define an envelope which is called an influence line and which
is of great importance in the design of girder bridges. These influence
lines have been carefully investigated and tabulated in Analytische Er-
mittelung und Anmendung von Einflusslinien by Lederer, for example.
The most interesting case is that of a member continuous over a large
number of equally spaced hinged supports. The maximum and minimum
moment diagrams for partial and moving loads on the principal and on

adjacent spans are given in Fig. 3, where is also given a typical arrange-
ment of reinforcing rods for a concrete girder.
Where the spans are not equidistant, each case must be specially in-
vestigated and the maximum and minimum moment or influence lines
drawn. It often happens that in a short span adjacent to a large one,
only negative moments will be found. Such cases can be discussed graph-
ically by the methods given in Trusses and Arches, Part II, by Greene.

The spacing of shear members of constant section or of stiffeners of
plate girders can be done most conveniently by graphical methods when-
ever the loading is assumed as uniformly distributed. In this case the
shear diagram is triangular in shape as shown in Fig. 4. If the concrete
of the reinforced beam is assumed to carry any shear or the web of
the girder is allowed any stress, then a horizontal strip along the bot-
tom of the triangle may be ignored, thus graphically reducing the
stresses to be carried by the members under investigation. In any case,
however, the real problem is to so divide the area of a triangle by ver-
ticals as to make exactly equal, the areas of the trapezoids thus formed.


This can be done as in Fig. 5, provided the total number of stirrups
or stiffeners over a given length is known, or the spacing is determined
at a given point. In one case the diameter of a semicircle equal to the
given distance is divided into the known number of equal parts. In
the other case, the known spacing is to be carried over the whole diameter
by working backward from the spacing at the special point.
Another problem which is rather intricate and often impossible tp
solve analytically but which is very easy with graphical methods, is the
determination of the position of the neutral axis, the moment of inertia
and the stresses in members of irregular shapes which are subjected to
flexure. While a cylinder can be treated analytically without great
trouble, still it may be considered as typical of many actual cases and
since the distribution of the steel usually goes around the whole cir-
cumference of the member, its treatment is entirely general and can be
followed with any shape of piece and arrangement of reinforcemnt.
The section is first divided into laminae on the compression side
and the area of each treated as a force acting through the center of the
area. For convenience, the dividing planes of the laminae are passed
through the centers of the reinforcing bars, the areas of which bars
multiplied by n (the ratio of the moduli of elasticity of steel and con-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
crete) are themselves treated as forces. The forces 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
are then obtained with which the left hand part of the force polygon Tn
Fig. 6a, is formed. The area of the lower reinforcing bars is multi-
plied by n for the forces I, II, III, IV, with which the right hand part
Flg.e.
of the force polygon in Fig. 6a is obtained. The funicular palygon in
6b is then drawn,
The intersection A, of the two funicular polygons determines the
neutral axis N A.
The sum of the moments of the laminae of the concrete above the
neutral axis considered as forces, equals the pole distance H x A i;
similarly, the moment of n times the area of the reinforcement (con-


sidered as a force) below the neutral axis also equals H x A i. It
follows that the condition that the statical moment of the section above
the neutral axis should equal that below is fulfilled at the intersection
A, and the line N A is the neutral axis, neglecting the tension of the
concrete.
The moment of inertia of the pieces equals the shaded area g A f i
(the funicular polygon,) multiplied by 2 H. The area in (b) is meas-
ured to the scale to which the section a, b, c, d is drawn; H is measured
to the scale to which the lengths 1', 2', 3', 4' are drawn.
For, the moment of I about the axis N A is equal to the length i A
multiplied by the pole distance H. The moment of inertia of I about
the same axis equals the moment of the moment of I—that is, i A x H x
i f. But i A multiplied by i f equals twice the area of the triangle i f A,
and accordingly the moment of inertia of I about the axis N A equals
the area of the triangle i f A x 2 H. Similarly, we may show that the
area g h i multiplied by 2 H equals the amount of inertia of the force
1 about the axis N A, and the area of g A i multiplied by 2 H equals
the moment of inertia of 1, 2, 3, 4 about the axis N A, so that the
moment of inertia of the whole section equals the area of f g A x 2 H,
as stated.
The maximum stress in the concrete is found from the equation
M = c I/u
Where M is the bending moment (within safe limits), c is the maxi-
mum stress on the most compressed face of the concrete, I is (he
moment of inertia, as found above, and u is the distance from that face
to the neutral axis. Similarly, the stress on the steel is found from
the equation
M = f I/y
where y is the distance from the neutral axis to the tensile reinforce-
ment in question, f is the unit stress on the steel, and the other sym-
bols are as before.
It will be seen that no matter how irregular the section or the
spacing of the bars, the method remains simple, the accuracy of the re-
sult depending on the scale of the drawing and the care used in mak-
ing it.
Similar methods have been devised for the graphical determination
of the problem when axial tension or compression is combined with
flexure. For this work there may be consulted Mohr, Handbuch fur
Eisenbetonbau, or Morsch, Eisenbetonbau.


THE DISINTEGRATION OF CEMENT FLOORS
AND SIDEWALKS
By Alfred H. White, '93, Junior Professor of Chemical Engineering.
The superficial phenomena accompanying the disintegration of cement
floors and sidewalks are common enough to obtrude themselves all too
often upon the attention of even the casual observer. The uncertainty
as to the causes of the unsatisfactory behavoir and the doubt as to the
tenure of usefulness of such cement surfaces must have caused other
materials to be preferred to cement in very many cases. Yet the exist-
ence in good condition of cement sidewalks after more than a quarter of
a century's service shows that the trouble is not necessarily inherent in
the cement or in the manner of using it. The following discussion of
the causes of trouble and the means of avoiding it is based largely on
experiments conducted by members of the department of Chemical Engi-
neering at the University of Michigan. The subject is considered from
the standpoint of the slow chemical changes which hydraulic cement un-
dergoes during the setting and hardening process, and which may result
in visible ill-effects only after the lapse of many years. The effect of
the natural atmospheric agencies is also considered.
It is assumed in this discussion that the hydraulic cement is Port-
land cement, which has been mixed with water of acceptable quality,
neither the influence of sea-water nor of the objectionable alkali waters
of the western states being considered. It is also assumed that the sand
and gravel used in concrete can be considered as entirely inert and stable
mineral matter without decomposable organic material or objectionable
mineral substances, such as sulphides which are frequently present, in
cinders.
The measurements upon which this paper is based have all been made
upon bars of neat cement. Conclusions drawn from them will apply
only qualitatively to concrete consisting largely of inert sand and gravel.
An expansion or contraction of the neat cement will indicate a movement
of the concrete in the same direction, the extent of this movement being
manifestly a function of at least two independent variables—the propor-
tion of cement and the proportion of voids in the concrete. We have
made no attempt to determine the influence of this latter factor which
varies wiaely with difference of manipulation, as has been shown by
published resmlts. The data as summarized by Sabin show that on the


whole the changes are more nearly proportionate to the percentage of
cement used than would be expected. However, when any attempt has
been made in this paper to make quantitative assumptions it has been
expressly mentioned in the accompanying text.
This discussion of the deterioration of cement surfaces restricts
itself to the usual causes which may be operative in the central portion
of the United States where the surfaces may be either continuously or
intermittently wet or dry and may be subject to the action of frost. It
may be considered under the following heads:
1. Normal changes of volume when good cement is properly used.
Disintegration of cement surfaces alternately wet and dry.
2. Effects of bad cement.
Free lime.
Free magnesia.
3. Effect of unfavorable conditions during hardening process.
NORMAL CHANGES IN VOLUME WHEN GOOD CEMENT IS PROPERLY USED.
Good cement when mixed neat with water will set hard in from one
to ten hours. It would be ideal if there should be absolutely no change
in volume after the cement had thus taken its hard set, but this ideal
cannot be attained in practice. Exact measurements made on bars of
neat cement which have stood in the air for six years show in all cases
a gradual contraction which at the end of a year amounts to between .2
and .3%, and at the end of six years to another .1%, the total contraction
being about .4%.
A similar bar of good cement placed in water will expand slowly
and quite regularly, the expansion at the end of one year being about
.1% and increasing very slowly to five years, after which the volume
remains almost constant with a total expansion of less than .2% over
its initial volume. Cement which has been aged before it is used will
show sometimes less than half this expansion.
A bar of neat cement kept in water always shows expansion, and
one kept in air contraction. This behavoir is due entirely to the mechan-
ical action of the water, for if a bar which has been kept in water be
allowed to dry out it slowly contracts, and if after this treatment it be
placed again in water it expands. This alternate contraction and expan-
sion caused by wetting and drying of neat cement amounts to about .15%.
This is roughly 250 times as great as the expansion caused by a change
of temperature of 1° F.


DISINTEGRATION OF CEMENT SURFACES ALTERNATELY WET AND DRV.
The surface coating of cement walks and stuccoed outside walls is
often as rich a mixture as one to one and is not usually poorer than one
part of cement to two of sand. These figures indicate that even making
allowance for the dilution by the sand that the change in volume of these
rich mixtures due to alternate wetting and drying will be fully as great
as that due to change from winter to summer temperature. These two
factors of temperature and moisture may sometimes tend to neutralize
one another and sometimes be cumulative. A stuccoed well which is wet
in summer may expand twice as much as would be expected from the
temperature alone. Fortunately the steel lath usually used is from its
construction elastic and yields, but it is no wonder if hair cracks appear
when the mortar is too rich.
This phenomenon is particularly important in cement walks where
the base of lean concrete may be considered as being always moist in
summer. The surface is, however, alternately dry and wet, and is more-
over much richer in cement, so that the contraction and expansion will
be greater. If we assume that in summer the base of the sidewalk
remains at constant volume and that the surface expands and contracts
one-third as much as neat cement or .05% between the dry and wet state,
we will have a change of volume of the surface compared with the base
of over half an inch on a 100-foot walk. Expansion joints in walks are
even more necessary on this account than to allow for temperature
changes.
This unconsidered expansion and contraction was undoubtedly re-
sponsible for the disintegration of walks laid at a time when the practice
was to put down a considerable section of base and let it set before
applying the top coat, with the result that the top coat was so poorly
bonded to the lower part that it split off. The dishing of each section
on older walks may be laid to this same cause. The surface contracting
in dry weather would warp a light base or would split off from the base
and become itself warped before it would be broken by traffic. The
modern practice of applying the surface coating before the base has set
gives a firm bond which should be strong enough to prevent warping.
EFFECTS OF BAD CEMENT.
No cement should ever be used for any purpose which fails to pass
the steaming test for constancy of volume as embodied in the standard
specifications of the American Society for Testing Materials. It is a
mistake to assume that since cement coatings do not have to support


any load that inferior cement may be used. The tensile strength and
fineness of grinding may indeed be of minor importance, but changes in
volume which might be negligible when the cement is mixed with seven
parts of gravel lead to very evident defects in a rich cement coating.
The evils of unsound cements are due to their excessive expansion
after setting. It is probable that the only two important agents which
cause this undue expansion are free lime, which causes slow expansion
both in water and air, and free magnesia, which causes very slow expan-
sion in water but does not cause expansion in air.
EFFECT OF FREE LIME.
Lime which has been burned at a low red heat and then finely ground,
hydrates within a very few minutes after being brought in contact with
water, and would not therefore be injurious as a constituent of Portland
cement. Lime which has been burned at the white heat of the Portland
cement kiln hydrates much more slowly and expands fifty per cent more
than the lime burned at the lower temperature.
The expansion due to free lime when the cement is kept under water
occurs mostly during the first seven days and is apparently complete by
the end of two months. The disintegration of cement surfaces which
have been constantly wet can therefore not be laid to free lime unless
trouble manifests itself within two months after the work is done.
The expansion due to free lime appears much more slowly when the
cement is exposed to the air after hardening. It can hardly be detected
after one month even when the cement is so bad as to utterly go to
pieces on the boiling test. A bar of neat cement with much free lime
still showed a decided contraction after one month in the air, although
not quite so large as a good cement should show under similar conditions.
At the end of two months the contraction had changed to a positive ex-
pansion which at the end of nine months had amounted to over one
per cent. At the end of a year the bar was too badly cracked to allow
further measurement. The expansion due to free lime does not always
take place even this rapidly, however, for we have on record measure-
ments on a bar made from cement showing bad cracks on the boiling
test which did not expand enough to equal its initial measurement until
after five years. Now after eight years its expansion is nearly four-
tenths of one per cent over its initial volume. Very few engineers would
contemplate with equanimity the prospect of such a change in volume
in cement which was to go into structures for which they were respon-
sible, but still they do not always take adequate precautions to exclude
undesirable cements of this type.


EFFECTS OF FREE MAGNESIA.
Magnesia is a more insidious foe than lime, for it is not always
detected by the boiling test. The standard specifications restrict the total
magnesia to four per cent, which is probably safe. A larger amount is
sometimes harmless, as has been shown in previous publications from
this laboratory, but until a better method of detecting dangerous mag-
nesia has been developed the only safe way is to keep it within known
safe limits.
Magnesia when burned hard, as in Portland cement, hydrates and
expands very slowly in water, the expansion being hardly noticeable
until a year has elapsed and continuing for many years. Our series has
been running for seven years and a recently published article by Dycker.-
hoff gives a similar series of measurements for ten years. Both series
agree in showing that the expansion has not yet ceased.
The effect of such slow and steady expansion may be seen on the
State Street side of the Campus of the University of Michigan, where
an unbroken walk one quarter of a mile long was laid in 1896. The
walk was cut into four foot blocks but apparently no special expansion
joints were provided. The writer recalls that the first sign of deprecia-
tion he noted in the walk was the appearance of a few humps easily
apparent to the bicyclist passing over them. An inspection of the walk
at these points showed that the top coat had parted from the base and
had been strong enough to resist the lateral thrust of expansion, so that
instead of crumbling, the two slabs had been forced into an inverted Y
position, under which the fingers could easily be inserted. About once
a year one of these humps would appear, be knocked out and replaced.
The last one two years ago was examined by the writer, who found the
upheaved slab about one inch thick and so hard that it was not easy to
break it with a hand hammer. At the present time the walk after twelve
years' service is in rather bad condition. In the quarter-mile stretch
there are also patches of replaced cement which the writer ascribes to
these upheavals. In several other places slight upheavals are to be noted,
and the top coating is broken in many places and probably detached from
its base almost everywhere. These results cannot be ascribed to thermal
expansion but can be due only to steady expansion of the cement used.
So far as is known free magnesia is the only constituent of the cement
which could account for it. It is impossible to prove it because no
chemical examination of the cement was ever made. Other instances of
similar expansion might be cited.
So far as is known magnesia exerts no such harmful influence in the


floors of buildings which are always dry. Apparently the hydration of
magnesia under such circumstances is so slow that it cannot be detected
even after five years. However, since it is possible to get cement with
a safe amount of magnesia without any extra cost, very few people will
care to experiment with high magnesia cements.
EFFECT OF UNFAVORABLE CONDITIONS DURING HARDENING PROCESS.
The hardening of Portland cement is due to the solution of the
cement by water with partial decomposition and the subsequent deposi-
tion of less soluble hydrated crystalline bodies which in their growth
bond together the sand and gravel. The attainment of the "hard" or
"permanent" set does not mark the completion of any definite reaction,
but simply indicates that the new crystal growth has progressed to such
an extent that the mass will bear some slight pressure without distortion.
The completion of this crystalline growth is not attained for several years.
Since this crystalline growth starts almost as soon as the cement is
wet, and should continue without interruption, it is manifestly desirable
that the concrete should be put into place with as little delay as is con-
sistent with thorough mixing. If concrete has begun to stiffen before
it is used it will not be as strong as it otherwise would be, although the
dangers from this source have possibly been overestimated.
DANGERS IN WARM WEATHER.
The hardening process takes place only in presence of moisture and
therefore the cement surface must be kept wet until it has progressed
enough to give considerable strength to the concrete. The capillarity ot
the concrete usually retains sufficient moisture in the interior of the
mass, but the surface must be protected from too rapid evaporation in
warm weather. Cement walks sometimes show the effects of. this in a
crumbling surface not over a quarter of an inch in depth, the top coat
below this being sound. Cement floors in reen forced concrete buildings
may show an aggravated form of this same trouble where the top coating
has been laid on a dry and porous concrete floor which sucks the water
from the top coating, leaving it dry and friable.
DANGERS IN COLD WEATHER.
A low temperature delays the setting of Portland cement, as it does
all other chemical reactions. So far as we know, however, it will be
only the rate of reaction which will change with temperature, and the
final products should be the same. A case has recently come to the


writer's attention which indicates that there may be another source of
trouble when the set is excessively slow. A cement coating is composed
of particles of different specific gravity, the cement being heavier tljan
the sand. The fine particles of sand work to the surface or are carried
there by the capillary action of the evaporating water, while the heavier
cement tends to settle to the bottom, leaving the surface skin deficient
in cement and consequently friable. It is apparently not advisable to lay
cement floors where the initial set may be delayed so long that the sur-
face cannot be trowelled within two hours after the cement is poured.
It is also dangerous to heat the room with open fires while the cement
is setting, as, if the temperature is only a few degrees above freezing,
the carbon dioxide from the fires will form an unstable modification of
calcium carbonate which will disintegrate when the temperature rises
and make a very friable surface.
The freezing of water in concrete introduces a different factor on
account of the expansion of the ice, which must inevitably have a disin-
tegrating effect on the concrete. If the freezing takes place, as it some-
times does on the surface, soon after the concrete has been put in place
and afterward the water thaws, the hardening process will continue. It
is possible that the danger may thus partially repair itself, the situation
being somewhat similar to that obtained when concrete is mechanically
disturbed after starting to harden. The new crystalline growth will not,
however, be able to bridge any but microscopic crevices, and the material
will almost certainly show unrepaired cracks which will cause weakness
and rapid disintegration if the surface is exposed to abrasion.
SUMMARY.
The cracking and disintegration of cement floors, walls and walks
composed of mixtures rich in cement may be due to lack of knowledge of
the properties inherent in all cement coatings, or to use of defective
cement, or to the improper use of good cement. All cement surfaces
expand when wet and contract when dry, and in any large piece of
work expansion joints must be allowed. Cement surfaces rich in cement
and alternately wet and dry, as is the case with sidewalks, are especially
liable to disintegration through 'the expansion and contraction of the top
coat on the relative constant base. The top coat must be bonded very
firmly to the base to prevent this.
The trouble due to defective cement is caused by the slow expansion
of free lime or magnesia in the cement. The cement should always be
tested before use, especially sidewalks where the cement is put under


more trying conditions than in any other common use to which it may
be put.
Trouble due to improper use of good cement, aside from use of too
little cement and defective mixing, may usually be laid to too rapid
drying of the cement in warm weather, or to too slow a set in cold
weather. There is danger in the use of open fires to warm rooms where
floors are being laid because of the action of carbon dioxide on the
cement.


COMPARISON OF WATER TUBE BOILERS
By C. H. Fessenden.
A glance through the boiler advertisements of any engineering paper
will at once impress the reader with the number of different water tube
boilers being manufactured today. So many forms are shown that he
begins to think there is no limit to the number of combinations of tubes
and drums that may be made, bricked in and called a boiler. The best
known makes are:
Babcock and Wilcox (B. &amp; W.)
Aultman and Taylor (A. &amp; T.)
Keeler.
Franklin.
Heine.
Stirling.
Rust.
Wickes.
Cahall.
A close examination of the construction of the many different water
tube boilers shows a similarity between several makes. B. &amp; W. and
A. &amp; T. arc almost identical. The Franklin and Heine are very much
alike, and the Keeler differs from them only in the method of baffling
and the angle between tubes and drum. This boiler is the connecting
link between the B. &amp; W. and Heine types. The Stirling is in a class by
itself. In the vertical class we have the Wickes, which differs from the
Cahall in the method of baffling and in the use of parallel rather than
diverging tubes. The Rust might be called a cousin to both the Wickes
and the Stirling.
With the rapid growth in the demand for power during the last fifty
years the boiler business flourishes and many companies were formed
with plenty of business for all. As the demand steadied down the com-
petition grew strong and showed itself in better designs, prices and grade
of workmanship. Cast pressure parts are fast becoming a thing of the
past and the boiler company that has not replaced all such parts b&gt;
wrought steel must do so quickly or cease to be a rival of other more
wide-awake manufacturers.

In comparing boilers the items that must necessarily enter are:
1. Efficiency.
2. Cost.
3. Adaptability.
The efficiency of a boiler depends on its ability to extract heat from
the hot gases passing through it, and 'therefore entirely on its construe-

tion. Circulation of the water over the heated surface is an important
factor and as the heat transference is directly proportional to the differ-
ence in temperature of the water and heating surface, to obtain the best
results throughout the entire boiler the 'hottest gases should come in
contact with the hottest water, and the coolest gases with the coolest
water. The tendency of steam to rise to 'the surface sets up a circula-
tion in any case, but the best circulation can only be obtained by suitable
arrangement of hcatirg surface and path of gases.
Boilers of the B. &amp;: W. and Stirling types do not differ materially in
efficiency or effective heating surface and the curves given below, though
based on the Stirling, may be applied to the B. &amp; W. or A. &amp; T., as well,
and with suitable modification to other makes of boilers. The efficiency
is taken as 66% with coal of 12000 B. T. U. per pound as fired and for

every 1000 B. T. U. variation in heating value from this standard the
efficiency is varied 3%. The heating value in B. T. U. per pound of coal
as fired is plotted along the horizontal axis and the efficiency along the
vertical. With a coal of 13500 B. T. U. an efficiency of 70.5% may be
guaranteed as shown. The second curve showing the evaporation with
coals of different value is plotted from the following data:

With a pound of coal of 11000 B. T. U., 7.2 lbs. of water may be

This is equivalent to 7.2/34.5=.208 Boiler H. P. A 300 H. P. boiler
would then require 300/.208=1440 lbs. of this coal per hour. Crediting 10
sq. ft. of heating surface to the horse power gives 3.45 pounds of water
evaporated f. and a. 212° per sq. ft. of heating surface per hr. and this
multiplied by the ratio of heating surface to grate surface, which we will
call R, gives the number of pounds of water evaporated per sq. ft. of
grate per hr. The coal assumed will be burned at the rate of 3.45/7.2 R
pounds per sq. ft. of grate per hr., which with R = 50 becomes 24 pounds.
The other curves shown are constructed from the equation 3.45 R =
lbs. of coal per sq. ft. of grate per hr. x equivalent evaporation (f. and a.
212°) per pound of coal. R and the number of pounds of coal are as-
sumed and the equivalent evaporation determined.

With R = 50 and coal 11000 B. T. U., equivalent evaporation 7.2,
the number of pounds of coal that must be burned per sq. ft. of grate
per hr. is represented by a point at the intersection of an ordinate from
50 on the ratio of h. s. to g. s. scale and an abcissa from 7.2 lb. equivalent
evaporation. Such a point falls on the 24 lb. line.
Reference to the book "Stirling" may be made for curves showing
the draft required for different grades of coal and different rates of
burning. Another interesting curve in the same book shows the effec-
tiveness of the heating surface depending on its position between furnace
and stack.
Efficiencies being equal, the deciding factor in favor of one boiler
over another is cost, and this is to be taken in the broad sense, i. e., to

include first cost, cost of operation, repairs and depreciation. The only
items requiring comment are the last two. They both depend largely on
the character of workmanship and materials but the repairs depend to a
great extent on the design. As an example of a bad case, take the old
Cahall boiler; to replace a tube it was necessary to sacrifice several good
ones. Under test the cast iron headers used on the older B. &amp; W. boilers
showed a breaking strength of about 1300 lb., but occasionally a fireman
would let the water level get down and then turn cold feed into the hot
boiler and crack them. The writer saw a case of this kind about a year
ago; six headers were broken and of course they were all on different
banks of tubes, so that of the 90 tubes in the boiler 54 had to be cut out
to remove the broken headers. Tubes of this kind cost about $3.25 each,
so that over and above the cost of the broken parts $175.50 had to be
sacrificed.
The B. &amp; W. boiler was one of the pioneers, and its development
has been along rational lines,—it has kept its original design and gradu-
ally improved certain details until today its construction is above serious
reproach. The last pronounced step was the discarding of all cast pres-
sure parts. A few years ago the headers, mud drums, cross boxes,
nozzles, etc., were all made of cast iron or cast steel. To make a wrought
steel mud drum or a cross box seemed comparatively easy, but the header
with its peculiar staggered form offered many difficulties. These have
been overcome and the headers are now formed without seams from a
single steel plate. Possibilities of such accidents as mentioned above are
now greatly diminished.
The size of the boiler is changed by increasing the number of hori-
zontal rows of tubes, or the number of vertical rows, or both; the length
of the tubes is usually 18' 0", but occasionally 16' o" tubes are used. With
this method of increasing size it is evident that the ratio of heating sur-
face to grate surface will vary considerably; the range of variation is
41.7 in a 6 wide 6 high boiler to 59.4 in a 24 wide 14 high. As an ordi-
nary size, 10 wide 10 high—210 h. p.—ratio of heating surface to grate
surface 47.9, might be taken.
Preliminary to cleaning the boiler considerable time is taken up in
removing header caps, two for each tube. Counting about 2 H. P. to a
tube, for a 300 H. P. boiler there are approximately 300 caps. To replace
them and make them tight requires even more time. Of course, to offset
this in comparison with the Stirling boiler a man can clean the B. &amp; W.
tubes faster and easier than the curved Stirling tubes from his cramped
position in the hot drum.


The B. &amp; W. is partly assembled in the shops; the tubes are ex-
panded into the headers and the cross boxes are put on the drums so
that when the boilers arrive at their destination the only tube expanding
to be done is on the connecting tubes between the headers and cross boxes
and headers and mud drum. The Stirling must be entirely assembled at
the place of erection. Boilers like the Heine can be entirely assembled at
the shop, so that the time and expense for erection are much less than
with the Stirling.
Neither the B. &amp; W. nor the Heine class allows much variation in
shape and it is an unusual and difficult thing for such a boiler to be
much altered. Of course in designing an entirely new plant, the building
can be made to conform to the boiler installation, but cases constantly
arise where additional boilers are installed in old plants having boilers
of different make. This brings up the question of adaptability. In some
places floor space is so limited that it would be impossible to install a
boiler of the horizontal type. In others, the scant head room might make
a vertical boiler out of the question; in addition to this the floor space
might be almost square, so that a boiler of the B. &amp; W. type would not
do—a Stirling would. The adaptability of the Stirling boiler is only one
of its good points. Its construction is extremely simple, no headers or
connecting boxes of any kind, tubes expanded directly into the drums,
each tube normal to the surface of the shell. The path of gases and
circulation of the water are ideal. Any space at all is good enough for
it, long, short, square, rectngular, high or low, it can be adapted to all
and still give uniformaly good results. In the B. &amp; W. type, the headers
are very expensive parts, and by dispensing with any such part the
Stirling is able to make a better boiler cheaper. The bending of the tubes
is a simple process, and with flexible turbine cleaners they can be cleaned
as thoroughly as any straight tube.
Taking up now the vertical types. Rust, Wickes, and Cahall, they
should be ranked in the order named. The Cahall was the pioneer, and
was, in its day, considered a good boiler, but its design has never been
improved to any great extent, and the Wickes and Rust had no difficulty
in surpassing it. The Cahall is not baffled sufficiently to extract all the
heat possible from the gases. The tubes are not so arranged as to be
easily replaced. A change in size means a change in the length of tubes
or their number or both, and a change in the number of tubes requires
different sizes of drums. Every size of drum of this shape requires a
separate set of formers. Pipes entirely outside the setting carry the water
from the upper to the lower drums and losses occur due to radiation.


The Wickes has altered the design so as to obtain better baffling, but
in other respects all the objections to the Cahall, except the last, apply
here also. Both have the advantage of being fairly easily cleaned.
The Rust boiler overcomes the objections named above and is similar
to the Stirling in that any power may be obtained by simply widening
the boiler. It uses straight tubes expanded into flattened portions on the
sides of the drums. The baffling is similar to the Wickes.


FAN PRESSURES
J. R. McColl, American Blower Co., Detroit, Mich.
Even among those engaged in the fan business, there is a great
deal of misunderstanding as to the matter of pressures on the inlet and
outlet sides of the fan. For a given service, several sizes of one type
of fan could be chosen, but each would operate under different condi-
tions of efficiency, speed, and relative magnitude of the velocity and
the static pressures which go to make up the total pressure.
Probably the first to make an analysis of fan pressures and apply it
to the proper selection or proportion of fans for a given service was
Mr. F. R. Still, Chief Engineer of the American Blower Company, whose
methods were divulged several years later in a paper which he read
before the Western Society of Engineers. The extensive work which
has been done along this line by Commander Taylor of the Bureau of
Construction and Repair, Navy Department, Washington, D. C, as well
as by others who have made fans a special study, gives evidence that a
proper view of the subject of fan pressures is necessary for an under-
standing of fan design and fan performance.
It is customary in measuring all fan pressures to regard atmospheric
pressure as zero. As in hydraulics, air of a given velocity and of a known
specific gravity, is capable of exerting a pressure which may be ex-
pressed in inches of water or in ounces per square inch. A thirty mile
gale, for example, with air weighing 0.07465 pounds per cubic foot will
be equivalent approximately to % ounce pressure per square inch exerted
on a chimney or wall against which the wind is blowing. This pres-
sure is above the atmospheric pressure and is due only to velocity.
Air enclosed in a tank or chamber may have a static pressure above or
below the atmospheric pressure outside. We shall refer to the two
pressures of air as "velocity" pressure and "static" pressure. The total
pressure at the fan inlet or outlet may be made up entirely of one of
these, but it is usually a combination of the two, the proportions depend-
ing on the service and the size of the fan.
In the following illustrations, we have chosen the centrifugal type
of fan but the same general discussions will apply to the propeller type.
In each figure are shown two tubes,, one o Pitot tube and the other a


THE MICHIGAN TECH NIC
static tube, each connected to a manometer. The Pitot tube, in actual
practice, is made in a somewhat different form in order to avoid errors
due to eddies. It is customary to combine the static and Pitot tubes
into one common instrument, but our illustrations will serve the pur-
pose for discussing the points in question. It is assumed that these are
inserted at a point where they will give an average reading for the
maximum work performed by the fan. All possible conditions of fan
performance can be divided into two general classes, one representing
conditions on the inlet side and the other, those on the outlet side.
Each of these can be subdivided into three classes, one with the pipe
entirely open, one with the pipe entirely closed, and the other betweeu
these two extremes, representing the pipe partly closed or restricted.
The extreme conditions mentioned are seldom if ever met with in
actual practice. The effect of the resistance of a pipe or duct system
connected to the inlet or discharge sides of a fan is practically the
same as a partly closed pipe, so far as pressures and volumes for a
given speed are concerned. It can, therefore, be considered that the
partial restrictions which we have shown in Figures Nos. 2 and 5
will represent a condition of resistance due to friction of a pipe system.
In Fig. 1, we have represented a fan, blowing, with no restriction on
the discharge. Furthermore, we will disregard any slight friction which
the short pipe may give and will assume
that there will be no loss in pressure
due to eddies or other causes. If we
insert two tubes, a and b, as shown,
one being a Pitot tube and the other
a static tube, we shall find that mano-
meters connected to these tubes will
give different readings, essentially as
shown. There being no friction in the
discharge pipe, the pressure will be en-
tirely velocity pressure, as shown by
the manometer a. There will be no
static pressure and, therefore, the man-
ometer, b, will give no reading. We
might point out here that the static
tube on the discharge side of the fan
represents static pressure to overcome
friction. It being assumed there is no friction, we shall have no static
reading.
In Fig. 2, we have varied the conditions by partially obstructing the

fan discharge, this being the same as
the frictional resistance of a duct or
piping system. We shall now hav:
a static pressure in the discharge pipe
as indicated by the manometer, b.
The manometer, a, will have exerted
upon it, not only the static pressure
but also the pressure due to the ve-
locity of the air. It is, therefore,
evident that the difference in readings
between the manometers a and b, will
give us the pressure due to velocity,
which in this case is illustrated as
J4" and would represent approximately
2,000 feet per minute, based on the whole area of the pipe.
In Fig. 3, we have assumed the discharge pipe entirely closed. The
fan will he handling no air, although the tendency to do so will pro-
duce a static pressure in the closed pipe. This pressure will act equally
on the manometers, a and b, and hence we shall have equal readings.
It is evident from the discussions
given covering the three hypothetical
cases, that the Pitot tube represents
the total pressure on the fan discharge,
for which the fan is to be given cred-
it in figuring up the air horse-power
and determining the mechanical ef-
ficiency, it being assumed that the inlet
of' the fan is perfectly free and that
no work is being done on this side.
It is also evident that the static tube
connected with the manometer, b,
gives us pressure which is equal to
the resistance in the form of friction
on the discharge side, provided the
delivery pipe is the same size as the fan discharge. We must not lose
sight of the fact that if the discharge pipe is larger than the fan out-
let that some of the velocity pressure will be converted into static
pressure, which will be available in helping to overcome the resistance
of the duct system. On the other hand, if the delivery pipe is smaller
than the fan outlet, it will necessitate the conversion of some of the
static pressure at the fan outlet into velocity pressure. But we are

considering only pressures at the fan outlet regardless of the conditions
of the piping system beyond.
The outlines given above cover the pressures on the discharge side
of the fan only. Let us now assume that the fan outlet is entirely free
and let us vary the conditions on the inlet side. We shall find that the
pressures bear a different relation to each other. Let Fig 4 repre-
sent an inlet pipe, unrestricted and of such length and character that all
friction may be disregarded, and we shaft have readings as shown by
the manometers, a and b, supposing,
of course, that there are no losses from
eddies or other causes. Air moves
from the static condition of the at-
mosphere to the fan inlet because the
pressure at the latter point is lower
than the atmospheric pressure. This
partial vacuum should give us a meas-
ure of the velocity of the air at that
point. The partial vacuum is acting
il«r..zi. upon the manometer, a ,as well as b, but
the velocity of the air is also acting upon this gauge because it is connected
to the Pitot tube. Theoretically, then, the velocity acting on the Pitot
tube will just offset the suction and we shall have a zero reading as
shown. It is evident, therefore, that the reading of the manometer, b,
in this case is the measure of the suction pressure necessary to give
velocity to the air, since, in accordance with our assumption of an un-
restricted inlet, no vacuum will be necessary to overcome friction or other
losses.
In Fig. 5, we have shown the inlet pipe partially restricted. The
manometer, a, will read lower than the
manometer, b, by the amount due to the
velocity of the air, for it is evident
that ihe latter is counteracting the par-
tial vacuum to certain extent. It is
evident, also, that the manometer, b,
will indicate a partial vacuum which
is necessary both to give velocity to
the air and to overcome the resistance
of the inlet pipe. It, therefore, repre-
sents the total pressure at the fan
inlet, and in this particular there is an
apparent discrepancy between the reading on the
on the outlet side of the fan, as outlined in Fig. 2.
Fl^.5.
inlet side and those


37
In Fig. 6, we have assumed the inlet pipe entirely closed. The partial
vacuum produced by the fan acts equally upon the Pitot tube and the
static tube and as there is no velocity
to further affect the Pitot tube, both
readings will be the same. %
In the outlines given above we have
made some assumptions, the significance
of which we must not lose sight of.
The resistance in the piping system is
mainly the friction of the air against
the surface of the duct. We shall find
that the velocity of the air next to the
pipe is considerably lower than the ve-
locity at the center. As stated, the
effect of all this, so far as volumes and
pressures a't the fan are concerned, is
practically the same as partly closing off the short pipe. We must re-
member, however, that such a restriction may involve higher velocities
of air through the orifice than would be found anywhere in an actual
installation. This means that somewhere in the system, static or poten-
tial pressure has been converted into velocity or kinetic pressure or
vice versa. In such a process of conversion, there have probably oc-
curred losses which will make our practical readings lower than the
theoretical readings. It all means that suitable allowances must be
made in practice for the probable losses in any system which in some
cases will be greater than in others.

VENTILATION AND HEATING WITH THE FAN
SYSTEM
With any process combining both heating and ventilation, a certain
amount of heat is always required to make up for that lost to the outside
atmosphere by transmission through walls and windows, and an additional
quantity for warming the air which enters for the purpose of ventilation.
The first-named amount depends upon the building construction and
the difference between indoor and outdoor temperature. It is, however,
independent of the volume supplied for ventilation. The heat required
for raising the temperature of the air for ventilating is directly propor-
tional to the volume, and is that necessary to raise the temperature of
this volume of air to that of the interior.
Cost of heating alone is practically constant, while the cost of ven-
tilation increases as the volume admitted increases. Since a cold apart-
ment will not be tolerated, while a foul atmosphere will be endured, we
readily see the principal reason why so few buildings are well ventilated.
Where the ventilation is not due to leakage but is obtained by bringing
air into the building as with a furnace or the indirect system, the expense
may easily equal 100% or more of that necessary for heating alone. How-
ever, in considering the expense of ventilation, only that portion of the
expense which is additional to the existing system should be considered
Of course, cost of ventilation is usually an important matter and
varies with the method employed. Natural ventilation and direct radia-
tion from stoves or steam pipes is naturally the cheapest, but at the same
time, it is not effective. The most satisfactory device for heating a large
building is a fan blower used in connection with a bank of steam pipes.
This means is positive, independent of the weather, and is certain to
produce satosfactory ventilation.
The public at large is beginning to appreciate the value of this system,
even though they have been led to think that good ventilation is almost
an impossibility. With this system,' which is sometimes called the Hot
Blast System, there is absolute control over the quantity and quality of
air supplied. It may be filtered and cleansed, heated or cooled, dried or
moistened, at will. It has the added advantage that when used with what
is called the hot and cold system, the temperature of the air admitted to
any apartment may be instantly changed without using additional heating
surface.
With a hot blast system the heating apparatus is located centrally, is


entirely enclosed in a fire-proof casing, and there is no possibility of dam-
age by leakage or freezing, for there is no scattered piping around the
building. By using the Plenum System, that is, by creating a slight pres-
sure within the building, all leakage is outward, a condition which pre-
vents cold inward drafts and avoids the possibility of drawing into the
building air from a source that is undesirable.
The heating surface is usually in the form of steam pipes arranged
by screwing into the baser, as shown by the accompanying illustration.
These pipes are 1 or \% inches in diameter, are set on 2}^" centers, thus
providing a free area for the passage of air equal to about 40% of the
whole area of the face of the section. The number of sections as well
as the number of pipes in a section depends upon the amount of air to
be warmed, and the velocity of the air passing through.
The air being warmed by contact with the steam pipes, takes jp the
heat rapidly, and because of the comparatively high velocity the heating
surface is very efficient, in fact, as compared with direct radiation, the
heating surface of the hot-blast apparatus is about five times as efficient,
which means that it need contain only about one-fifth the heating sur-
face. To speak more specifically, when the air velocity is about 1200
feet per minute the heat transmission averages about 10 (B. T. U.)
per square foot, whereas with direct radiation in still air the trans-
mission is less than 2 (B. T. U.)
The depth of the heater, that is the number of rows of pipe, is deter-
mined largely by experience. The air entering the pipes causes the con-
densation of steam in the pipes, the surface first exposed to the air
having the greatest condensation and, therefore, the greatest efficiency.
The subsequent surfaces have less and less efficiency until the temperature
difference becomes so small that it does not pay to extend the surface. A
consideration of this matter will show that the greatest surface efficiency
is secured with the highest velocity of air and least depth of heater, but
in practice the velocity of air is limited according to the type of building,
etc., and therefore, the heater must be made of sufficient depth to give
the desired temperature to the air.
The design and application of the hot-blast system and the method
of distributing the warmed air depend upon the character of the building.
Some buildings, such as factories, where comparatively few men are em-
ployed in a large space, the heating is more important than the ventiration
and in such cases it is often most economical to have the fan draw its
supply from the building itself, adding to the air the heat necessary to
maintain proper temperature. In a locomotive round-house, for instance,


the fan system serves a double purpose; it heats the building, usually by
discharging the air from overhead pipes and is also used for melting
the ice and snow from the locomotives.
In buildings of more than one story, the apparatus is usually placed
in the basement and made to deliver the warm air into vertical flues
from which it is discharged to suitable outlets on the several floors. Gal-
vanized iron pipe is commonly used for this distribution. In a textile
mill, the blower system serves also as an opportunity for moistening the
air.
There is another class of building in which the ventilation is of
primary importance, such as theatres, schools, and churches. In such
cases it is desirable to supply larger volumes of air at perhaps lower
temperature and at lower velocity. Due to the fact that the requirements
of the temperature and volumes are likely to vary in differnt rooms in a
large building, the system must be sufficiently elastic to meet these require-
ments. Probably the most simple method is to have a constant volume
of air properly tempered and then regulate the temperature within the
room by means of direct radiation. Another method is to have the fans
discharge the air at constant volume and temperature and then by placing
the supplementary steam coils at the point where the air enters the indi-
vidual room, regulate the temperature.
The third, and probably most satisfactory method, is to so arrange
the casing of the heating apparatus that the air discharged from it may
be hot or cold, or a mixture of warm and cool air. The proportions may
be nicely adjusted to meet the requirements. This system is usually
called the Hot and Cold System and must be equipped with suitable
dampers in both hot and cold connections, so that the proper temperatures
may be maintained.


DETROIT RIVER IMPROVEMENT*
41
Chas. Y. Dixon, '87, U. S. Assistant Engineer.
The improvement of waterways for navigation purposes has been
carried on by the United States almost without intermission for many
years. In general, this improvement has been limited to the deepening
and enlarging of channels and harbors in tidal waters along the coast;
the deepening of channels, construction of locks and levees along some
of the larger rivers; and similar improvements in the channels and har-
bors of the Great Lakes. The magnitude of these improvements has now
become such that the annual appropriations by Congress to provide for
these works has become about $60,000,000. In the region of the Great
Lakes, the greatest improvements required have been in their connecting
rivers; and, also, a number of harbors and many contributing streams
have been improved to provide suitable terminal facilities.
Although the scheme for improving these waterways has grown to
such proportions, this growth has not kept pace with the demands for
additional safeguards for navigation made by the increasing commerce.
The present amount of this commerce could not have been foreseen even
at a time that is in the memory of most of us. In this connection, it may
be well to recall that when a project contemplating the granting of lands
for a canal at the rapids in St. Marys River was referred to Congress
in 1843, the Hon. Henry Clay, one of the best informed men of his time,
ridiculed the scheme, stating that "this waterway was beyond the farthest
bounds of civilization, if not in the moon." Yet the traffic now passing
through the St. Marys River is but a little less than that brought through
the Detroit River, and it has been stated by a high authority that "the
tonnage of the Detroit River is now five times the foreign tonnage of
New York harbor, and greater than the combined tonnage of Liverpool,
London, and Hamburg, although on the Detroit River the navigation sea-
son is limited to about 240 days, while on the seaboard the season is 365
days."
The statistics relating to the commerce of the Detroit River for the
past season, have not yet been compiled, but it is known that the amount
of this commerce will be less than that for 1907, when this commerce
was about 71,000,000 tons, valued at about $697,000,000. This commerce
*A paper read before the University of Michigan Engineering Society,
January 15, 1909.


consists mainly of coal carried by upbound vessels, and ore and grain
carried by downbound vessels. The recent rapid growth in this commerce
may be more apparent when it is stated that about 75% of the total move-
ment of freight has been made during the past fifteen years, and this
commerce is expected to continue increasing perhaps at a less rapid rate
for years to come.
On account of the rapid growth in this commerce, improvements made
under one project have at times been but just completed when other
projects have been adopted providing for increased depths within areas
just improved. For this reason portions of the channel have been deep-
ened two or three times, making the resulting improvement much more
expensive than if the whole improvement had been made at one time.
However, an increased depth over the original depth was made more
quickly available, and this would in a large measure make up for the
increased cost. At present the improvements are inadequate for safe
navigation, but projects are under way at the most critical places which
it is hoped will provide safe channels until such time as ocean-going
vessels have access to the Great Lakes.
The channels of the Great Lakes which are the most dangerous to
navigation are through the St. Marys, St. Gair, and Detroit Rivers, and
in these localities improvements by the United States have been under
way intermittently for thirty years, and almost constantly for the past
twenty years. It is the purpose in this paper to present briefly some fea-
tures relating to the improvements in the Detroit River, with which the
writer has been connected for the past thirteen years.
The Detroit River is about 28 miles in length, and in the southern
portion of about 15 miles length, there are a number of islands which
divide the river into several channels. The river has ample depth for
navigation purposes from its head to about 10 miles above its mouth,
where it becomes shallower and for the greater part of this distance the
river botom consists of limestone bedrock overlaid in some places with
clay, sand, and boulders. It is through this portion of the river that
channel improvements have been necessary. For a length of about one
mile about five miles from the river's mouth, in that part Known as Lime
Kiln Crossing, the bedrock bottom is without the earth covering, and
originally the safe draft for vessels over it was about 12 or 13 feet near
the Canadian shore. When appropriations were first made by Congress
for an increased depth, immediate results were desired, and it was here
that the work was done. The improvement of this channel in Canadian
waters was continued with later appropriations, and it is still in progress.


As a result of these improvements up to 1892, there was a least
depth of about 16 feet for a channel of 300 feet width in the narrowest
places, although in some localities the depth had been increased to 20
feet for short distances. During 1892, a general project was adopted by
Congress providing for 20 feet depth throughout a channel of safe navi-
gable width. Under this project, up to 1897, a channel of the prescribed
deoth and of 300 feet or more width had been excavated through all the
shoal areas originally specified; and until 1902, the improvement consisted
in increasing the depth and width at angles, exposed places in the open
lake, and in removing many isolated shoals of small extent that were
found to interfere with safe navigation.
Prior to 1902, the projects for channel improvements provided for
depths at a midsummer stage of water, but as a result of the fluctuation
in the water surface due mainly to storms, there was often a least
depth of only 17 feet instead of 20 feet as contemplated by the project.
Therefore a new general project was then adopted, providing for 680
feet width and 21 feet depth at a low water stage, or about 23 feetdepth
at the reference plane formerly used. This made necessary the further
deepening of all that portion of the channel which had been improved
up to that time, together with much additional area. Work under this
project is now near completion. The total appropriation for Detroit River
improvement under the above mentioned projects is about $4,000,000, and
of this amount about $150,000 is still unexpended.
As a result of the rapid increase in Great Lakes tonnage at this time,
it was evident that the improvements contemplated by the existing projects
would soon become inadequate for safe navigation. Therefore, in 1907,
Congress made appropriations providing for a number of additional im-
provements, among others being one of $6,670,950 to secure a second
channel through the shallow portion at the mouth of Detroit River. This
channel is to be of 22 feet depth at a low water stage and 300 feet wide
from its north end to Bar Point, a distance of six miles, thence widening
to 800 feet, which width is maintained to deep water in Lake Erie, a dis-
tance of six miles.
In submitting the preliminary estimates for this project, three routes
were considered. The estimates indicated but little difference in the cost
of improvements along two of these routes, but the cost along the third
route was quite in excess of the others. However, the second route
being the straightest course, was much preferred by vesselmen, and was
finally adopted by Congress and christened by the same authority, the
"Livingstone Channel."


During the summer of 1907, accurate surveys were made along the
Livingstone Channel, specifications were prepared, and four contracts at
Sections 1, 2, 3, and 4, were let for the entire improvement at a cost of
about $400,000 less than was estimated. The work to be done under these
several contracts will be paid for on the basis of bank measurement of
material removed, except at Section 4, where payment will be made on
the basis of scow measurement. These contracts are described more in
detail as follows:
Section 1. Contractors, Great Lakes Dredge and Dock Co. of Chi-
cago, Ills. The channel area has a length of 5,800 feet and a width of
300 feet. There is to be removed limestone bedrock with some overlying
earth and boulders, all of about six feet average depth of material, to
the extent of 392,000 cubic yards at an average price of $1.72 per cubic
yard, or a total cost of about $673,200.
Section 2. Contractors, Grant, Smith &amp; Co. and Locher of Chicago,
Ills. The channel area has a length of 7,500 feet and a width of 300
feet. This area has been divided into two portions, one of 4,000 feet
length to be surrounded by cofferdams and excavated in the dry, and the
remaining 3,500 feet length to be paid for as if excavated by the usual
subaqueous method. Excavation by the dry method will include earth
and boulders of 5 feet average depth of material overlying bedrock to
the extent of 108,000 cubic yards at $0.60 per cubic yard, and limestone
bedrock of 16.8 feet average depth of material to the extent of 748,000
cubic yards at $1.20 per cubic yard; and by the subaqueous method, there
will be removed earth and boulders of 8.7 feet average depth of material
overlying bedrock to the extent of 292,000 cubic yards at $0.58 per cubic
yard, and limestone bedrock of 4 feet average depth of material to the
extent of 132,000 cubic yards at $2.68 per cubic yard. In addition, lump
sums are to be paid of $25,000 for construction of cofferdam, of $15,000
for partial removal of cofferdam, and of $5,000 for partial removal of
old railroad pier. The total cost of this work will be about $1,578,440.
This contract also requires the channeling of the sides of the channel
from the rock, but no payment will be made therefor directly, as the
prices bid for the removal of material include this cost. It is apparent
that better results may be obtained by the dry method than by the usual
subaqueous method of rock excavation, as the sides of the channel may
be left perfectly smooth and the bottom cleared of all loose material, thus
making the resulting improvement much safer for navigation. The dry
method is well adapted to this section on account of the shallow water
making the cost of cofferdams small as compared to the amount of


material within the inclosed area. The material for the cofferdam was
excavated from the channel area outside of the cofferdam, loaded on
flat scows, towed to the site of the dam by launches, and there unloaded
by steam shovels. The details of this cofferdam, its method of construc-
tion, and actual site were left mainly to the contractors, who are held
responsible for its maintenance.
Section 3. Contractors, P. R. McNaughton and O. E. Dunbar of
Buffalo, N. Y. The channel area has a length of 18,250 feet and width
of 300 feet, except for the south 1,000 feet, where the width increases
from 300 to 55,0 feet. There is to be removad sand, clay, and boulders of
7.8 feet average depth of material overlying bedrock to the extent of
1,610,000 cubic yards at $0.48 per cubic yard; and limestone bedrock of
4.3 feet average depth of material to the extent of 820,000 cubic yards at
$2.36 per cubic yard, the total cost being about $2,700,750.
Section 4. Contractors, G. H. Breymann &amp; Bros, of Toledo, O. The
channel area has a length of 29,000 feet and width of 800 feet, except for
the north 1,000 feet, where the width increases from 550 to 800 feet.
There is to be removed sand, clay, silt, boulders, and hardpan of about
4.0 feet average depth of material to the extent of 3,500,000 cubic yards
at a cost of 25j/£ cents per cubic yard, or a total of about $981,750.
At Section 4, payment is based upon scow measurement for the reason
that the contractors generally expected the material to drift and fill in
after dredging and before the final survey, making it necessary to dredge
over the same areas several times and receive no payment therefor. This
would not be necessary, as surveys in this locality made several yars after
the completion of former contracts showed little if any change in the
improved depth. The contractors would name their price high enough,
however, to allow for such filling in as they expected, therefore if was
deemed advisable to make payments on the basis of scow measurement.
Where conditions will permit of accurate surveys being made, it has
been found preferable to make payment for material removed on the basis
of bank measurement; but this method is manifestly unfair where the
material is unstable and liable to drift and fill in after dredging. Pro-
vision is also made for payment at the full contract rate for all material
above the required depth, at one-half the contract rate for the next two
feet of depth, and no payment for material excavated below this sub-
grade nor for material excavated outside of the specified area. Whatever
method of making payment is used, a Government Inspector is stationed
on each dredge and charged with the duty of keeping a complete record
of work done and of enforcing the provisions of the specifications. Some


of the reasons which make the scow measurement method of payment un-
desirable are as follows: Under this method, the agents of the contrac-
tors in their desire to be allowed enough often want more than the actual
material in the scow; and, also, where the material is easily removed,
there is a tendency to excavate too deep or outside of the specified area,
all of which, if the Inspector on the dredge is honest, and he usually is,
leads to constant dispute. There is also the constant temptation for the
Inspector to get along smoothly by allowing all that is asked, and at times
perhaps to receive a valuable present in return, without any check upon
the work after it leaves his hands. This statement is not intended to
reflect upon the contractors, as the writer has usually found them wanting
only what is due them, but their agents are often overzealous to make a
good showing for their work. This is all obviated by the bank measure-
ment method, as the amount finally received by the contractor is dependent
entirely upon computations made in the office from surveys. If any
irregularity then exists, the Assistant Engineer in charge of the work
should know of it and be held responsible. The writer may be somewhat
selfish in this matter, but he would much prefer to have the work so
conducted that he has the only chance at an irregularity.
A brief statement of the method of preparing specifications, the letting
of contracts, and of executing the work under the contract may be of
interest.
There must first be a demand for the work, and then instructions are
received from Congress through the Chief of Engineers and the Engineer
Officer in charge for the making of a preliminary survey and estimate.
This survey should be of such detail as to enable the approximate cost to
be determined. For this purpose, the character of material should be
ascertained so that the approximate unit price may be known; also,
soundings must be obtained from which are computed the approximate
quantities. Care should be taken that this preliminary estimate be large
enough to cover the work contemplated but,_ for the reputation of the
Assistant Engineer, it should not exceed the actual cost by more than
20%. When prepared, this estimate is transmitted to the Engineer Officer
in charge of the work, who is a West Point graduate and regular Army
Officer, and it is finally received by Congress. If that body deems the
improvement contemplated worth the cost, the appropriation is made, and
authority is given the Engineer Officer to enter into formal contract or
contracts for its execution. Then other surveys are made more in detail
than the preliminary, and from these is obtained the information which
enters into the specifications intended to govern the contract. The speci-


fications being prepared, they are transmitted through the proper channel
to the Chief of Engineers, and after approval, advertisement is made in
the leading journals for a period of about thirty days, requesting con-
tractors to submit bids for the performance of the work as described.
These bids are also sent to the Chief of Engineers with the recommenda-
tion of the Engineer Officer in charge as to their acceptance or rejection.
Should the bids be rejected, new bids are called for in the same way as
before; but if approved, authority is given to enter into contract, and
usually within ten days thereafter the actual work of excavation is com-
menced.
The surveys to which reference has been made consist in the taking
of soundings at regular intervals, usually at the corners of 10-ft. squares;
and in determining the character of material. The soundings are taken
through holes bored in the ice during the winter months, if practicable;
or from boats by the use of lines with tags at the required intervals;
stretched across the proposed channel; or from a float anchored in
desired positions. The character of material may be determined by bor-
ings, or by preliminary dredging at different places along the site of the
work. All locations of soundings, borings, or dredging are determined
by transit pointings from shore stations—these stations forming a part
of an accurately established triangulation system. While making these
surveys, water gauge readings are taken at 10-minute intervals at a con-
venient point on shore, the zero of this gauge being at the plane of refer-
ence. The soundings and depths to rock as determined by the borings
are then reduced by applying the corrections indicated by the water
gauge readings.
The reference plane is assumed arbitrarily prior to the preparation of
the specifications, but after entering into contract it canncft fairly be
changed while the contract is in force. The reference plane now used in
connection with Detroit River improvements corresponds to a Lake Erie
stage of 571.00 feet above mean tide at New York. This stage is the
lowest monthly mean since continuous observations have been recorded,
and it is about two feet lower than the average midsummer stage prevail-
ing for the past two seasons. Under bank measurement contracts, sur-
veys are made as stated prior to beginning work and after its completion.
Upon these two surveys alone depend the quantities for which payment
is made. Such surveys are also made at various times during the progress
of the work for the purpose of correcting partial payments which had
been estimated approximately from scow measurements.
The specifications governing contracts should give complete informa-


tion as to the work contemplated, and state clearly all conditions which
may affect the price of the work; but these specifications should not be
burdened with provisions which afe not intended to be rigidly enforced.
Bidders are always requested to make their own investigations as to the
nature of the work and the difficulties attending its execution, but almost
invariably they base their prices upon information furnished in the speci-
fications.
It is not necessary to go into detail in the description of the plan
used in subaqueous excavation. It may be stated, however, that the plan
of contractors engaged in this work on the Great Lakes is the equal of any,
and that that employed on the Detroit River is of the best.
Where earth alone is to be removed, the entire area, or a part of it,
is dredged over, cut by cut, and excavation made to about two feet below
the required depth. A drag, consisting of a bevel shaped iron shod beam
loaded heavily with scrap iron and suspended from one end of a dump
scow, is then used to level off any ridges that may be left. When drag-
ging this contrivance over the dredged area, the cutting beam is usually
set about one foot below the required depth. This tool is only effective
in soft material, but it does good work there, although at times some
redredging is necessary in places before the entire area can be cleared.
For rock excavation, where there is overlying earth, this earth is
first removed by dredging, then the rock is broken up by drilling and
blasting. The broken rock is removed by dredges, and following this the
area is cleared of all loose rock projecting above the required depth by
derrick scow with diver, each rock being chained by the diver and hoisted
up separately. The operation of a derrick scow with diver is slow and
costly, and the contractor usually avoids this as much as possible by dredg-
ing to a much greater depth than required, so that nearly all of the loose
rock remaining will be below the required depth.
Afteran area has been thus improved, either in earth or rock excava-
tion, the contractor claims the completion of his contract within that
area. Then the Government agant in charge of the work, as a means of
inspection, causes this area to be swept by a scow or raft having iron bars
suspended to the depth required by the contract. Should this inspection
disclose any material it is removed either by dredge or derrick scow or
both as is most suitable. When an area thus inspected is eventually found
clear at the required depth, that portion of the work is accepted as com-
pleted. During this inspection, the stage of water is constantly noted and
the depth of the iron bars is adjusted to agree with any change in this
stage.


With regard to the operation of drilling and blasting rock by the
subaqueous method, generally, the holes are drilled at the corners of 5-ft.
squares to a depth of about four feet below the sub-grade. The result
of a blast is the breaking up of the rock in the shape of an inverted
cone, the apex being the bottom of the hole, and when the holes are drilled
to the depth and distance apart stated the highest points of unbroken rock
will be well below the depth of pay material. Usually, each hole, as soon
as it is drilled, is loaded with 60% dynamite in an amount of about one
pound for each linear foot of drilling, and the dynamite discharged imme-
diately without moving the drill-boat or otherwise interfering with its
operation. At times, however, when working in rock of several feet depth,
each hole is charged with dynamite when drilled but not exploded until
after a large quantity of dynamite has been thus placed, in some cases as
much as two tons, and then the whole is exploded by firing only the last
hole charged. When this is done the drill-boat, for safety, must move to
some distance, and the resulting shock usually causes buildings on shore
in the vicinity to tremble. The contractors much prefer these large blasts
because of the easier drilling. When each hole is fired separately, the
rock at the adjacent hole is shattered at the surface and the hole is not
easily drilled; when fired in series, the rock is undisturbed and is more
easily drilled, except at the hole adjacent to the last blast. It is believed,
however, that the rock is broken up more thoroughly when holes are fired
separately than when tired a number at a time.
It is a common saying that familiarity breeds contempt, and this is
only too true with men who are accustomed to the use of explosives.
Several accidents have resulted from the use of dynamite on the Detroit
River, some of them of a serious nature, but it is believed that they can
all be attributed to carelessness. The most serious accident directly in
connection with this work occurred on August 14, 1908, when the prema-
ture explosion of dynamite in one of the last of a number of holes already
charged exploded the entire amount, a total of 4,440 pounds. The drill-
boat was completely wrecked, although fortunately it did not sink, and
the entire crew of 13 men were injured, some of them quite seriously.
This last hole had been partly charged with dynamite, when a small piece
of rock fell into it and prevented the loading tube from re-entering in
order to complete the charging. The steam drill was used to clear the
hole, and by lowering the drill too far the dynamite already placed was
struck and exploded. No one but the man who had become too familiar
with dynamite would risk his life by attempting with a steam drill to clear
out a hole that had been partly charged. This dangerous practice was


most uncommon and was unknown to the contractors, who were in no way
to blame. It is unnecessary to state that these same men will not again
attempt this trick. In this connection, it may be stated that one careless
man in a crew will frequently endanger the lives of the others, even
though they exercise the greatest care.
The amount of dynamite used on the work during the past year was
465 tons, and it is probable that during each of the next two years this
amount will be about 800 tons. Prior to the past season, all dynamite
used on this work was received by rail direct from the factories, but
during the past season a factory was established on a small island near
the site of the work and one of the contracting firms manufactures dyna-
mite for their own use there. The process of this manufacture is quite
interesting, also dangerous, and lest we become too familiar with it we
will pass to other equally interesting work.
The improvement already described is such as has been continued in
this vicinity for years past, although the operating machinery has been
improved and perfected from time to time. There is now a new method
used in this improvement, at least it is new to Detroit River. As has
been stated in the description of the specifications relating to Section 2
of Livingstone Channel, a portion of this area was required to be sur-
rounded by cofferdams and the inclosed channelway excavated in the dry.
The contractors for this work commenced operations on April 14, 1908,
and a portion of the area was surrounded by cofferdams by October 4
and the pumps started for unwatering the inclosed area. The work of
drilling and blasting the rock was commenced on October 20, and one
steam shovel began excavating the broken rock on October 25.
It was expected by the U. S. Engineer and stated in the specifications
that the entire area of 4,000 feet length would be surrounded by coffer-
dams, and this was at first undertaken by the contractors, but when the
dams had been nearly completed up to the water surface, the contractors
decided to put in an intermediate dam.vdividing the area into two portions,
one of 2,800 feet length and the other of 1,200 feet length. Within the
larger portion, there is little if any earth covering the rock, but within
the smaller portion there is an earth covering of several feet depth. The
contractors wished to remove this earth by dredging, and to make use of
it for cofferdam construction as it was the most suitable material at hand.
This would also insure the completion of the dam around the larger por-
tion before the end of the season and permit of work of excavation during
the winter months.


Since the letting of the contracts for the Livingstone Channel, the
contractors for this section have arranged with the contractors for Section
1, to take over 1,500 feet of the south end of their area, which together
with 300 feet at the north end of Section 2 will also be inclosed by dams
and excavated in the dry. This will make a total of 5,800 feet length of
channel to be excavated by the dry method, within three adjacent incio
sures of 1,800 feet, 2,800 feet, and 1,200 feet lengths respectively. The
total amount of material to be thus removed is nearly 1,000,000 cubic
yards of rock. This rock is a dolomitic limestone of Silurian formation,
lying in strata from one to four feet thick, and the dip is about three
degrees to the southwest.
The specifications require the removal of only so much of the coffer-
dams as crosses the channel and lies within 50 feet of its sides, and the
provision is also made that the west dam shall be at least 350 feet from
the channel to permit of future widening should this at any time be
necessary.
The old railroad pier extending out from Stony Island crosses the
site of the work, and prior to the construction of the dams, the velocity
of the current underneath this pier was about five miles per hour. To
break the force of this current, rock excavated from the channel at Lime
Kiln Crossing was placed at the site of the upper dam up to and above
the water surface. At the upstream side of this rock, earth was then
placed which had been excavated from the channel at the lower end of
Section 2 Livingstone Channel. Along the side dams and the lower end
dams, earth alone was placed. When the inclosure was pumped out, the
dams proved to be nearly water tight, there being but few leaks and these
have since been nearly closed. Such leakage and seepage as now appears
is disposed of by one 12-in. pump working but a few hours each day.
When the unwatering of the area was begun, in addition to two 12-in.
pumps, there were used 48 6-in. pipes through which air was forced
from the compressor plant. These pipes rested upon the river bottom
in about 12 feet of water, and the air was admitted at their lower ends.
This air lift caused the pipes to flow full of water until there was a
lowering of aboue five feet when they ceased to be effective owing
to the air being forced through the water instead of raising it. After
the air lift had been abandoned, the work was contniued by the pumps
and completed in 15 days' total time. The area unwatered was 2,806
feet long, about 1,700 feet average width, and about 7 feet average
depth, containing about 250,000,000 gallons.


The plant engaged on this work is as follows:—One air compressor
plant consisting of two compressors, one of 300 H. P. and the other of
700 H. P.; two 12-in. and one 8-in. steam pumps; three steam shovels;
three channeling machines; eighteen air-drivel drills; three cable-
ways with towers; one small locomotive with several flat cars for hand-
ling supplies; two scows equipped with machinery for unloading earth
and rock to form cofferdams; five flat scows for carrying earth and rock;
and three launches. The number of men employed is now about 200
but this number will soon be greatly increased.
The air compressor plant furnishes power for operating eighteen
drills , three channelling machines, and three cableway conveyors of
excavated material.
The rock is drilled and blasted in much the same was as described
for the subaqueous method, except that instead of the drills being mounted
upon boats they are small and portable, but the results secured are the
same at about one-third the cost. The broken rock is excavated by self-
propelling steam shovels and deposited in skips of about 2.5 cubic yards
capacity, and carried by the cableway conveyor outside of the channel
area and there deposited. One cableway conveyor is operated in con-
nection with each steam shovel. The scheme for the mid-air dump of
the skip is the invention of Mr. C. H. Locher, one of the contractors,
who devotes nearly his entire time to the supervision of this work.
This invention consists in throwing one of the cables towing the skip
upon a larger drum at the power house, causing this cable to travel
faster until the pull becomes sufficient to dump the skip at the desired
place. This clever device has been the means of greatly reducing
the cost of excavation by the dry method.
The channeling machines are operated ahead of the drills, and care
must be exercised in blasting near the sides of the channel that the
channeled face be not broken. Provision is made in the specifications
that 50 cents be deducted from money due the contractors for each square
foot of channeled face of wall which may be broken as a result of their
operations. The maximum depth of material to which the channeling
machines may operate is about twelve feet. In will therefore be neces-
sary to make two cuts in order to complete the required depth, and at
the top of the second cut there will be an offset in the channeled wall
of about nine inches. The width of the channel at the top of the
walls therefore must be about 301.5 feet to permit of the bottom width
being the required 300 feet.


In addition to the actual work of channel excavation, the contractors
have converted Stony Island, formerly a breeding place for mosquitos
and rattlesnakes, into a most desirable place for a summer home. The
entire island is under lease for the period of their contract, and it has
been cleared of underbrush and drained. It is here that the power plant
and shops are located; and also, there are about forty small well-built
cottages for the families of employees, a school house, and a general store.
It may be of interest to state that when requesting bids for the
work under this contract, they were asked for by both the subaqueous
and dry methods. The lowest bid by the dry method, that of Grant
Smith &amp; Co. and Locher, was about $400,000 less than the lowest bid
by the subaqueous method. Although the successful builders had just
eompleted similar work at the West Neebish Rapids in St. Mary's River,
many of the other contractors expected them to fail here. That Mr.
Locher has not lost faith in his own judgment is shown by their firm
taking on additional and more difficult work than that contemplated under
the original contract. It is a pleasure to state that the main difficulties
attending the execution of the contract with the Government have been
overcome; and, unless the contractors meet with unexpected hardship in
their later venture, they will be able to retire from business upon the
completion of this work with a handsome profit.
The writer has usually found figures indigestible when listening to
the reading of a paper of this nature; and, heretofore in this paper,
they have been used as little as possible. The following interesting
tables relating to the different items of cost incident to the work of
rock excavation have been prepared by Mr. Harry Hodgman with the
assistance of Mr. N. R. Macklem, and it is here submitted in the hope
that it will not prove too burdensome.

The first of these tables gives the average percentage of items of
cost under three different contracts at Lime Kiln Crossing. Under the
first of these contracts, the work was performed by Jas. B. Donnelly,
of Buffalo, N. Y., and completed on October 27, 1903; and under the
last two contracts, the work was performed by the Dunbar &amp; Sullivan
Dredging Co., of Buffalo, N. Y., and completed on December 15, 1906 and
December 5, 1908. The material removed under these three contracts was
Dolomitic limestone of Silurian formation in a total amount of 533.052
cubic yards.
The second table relates to excavation by the dry method at Sec-
tion 2 Livingstone Channel. As this work is but just commenced, the
figures given in this table may be changed greatly as the result of more
complete data. The material removed under this contract is of the same
character as that stated for Lime Kiln Crossing.
Upon the completion of the Livingstone Channel, the area of the
cross-section of the river will be very materially increased, and some
means must be adopted to preserve this area. This problem will not
likely be solved, however, until this improvement is near completion.
The writer is now much in favor of extending the east dam at Section
2 down to the head of Bois Blanc Island, for this extension using the
material excavated by the dry method and piled up along the east side
of the channel. This material would be suitable and conveniently near.
Such a dam would not only preserve the cross-sectional area but it would
also make the current straight on both sides of Bois Blanc Island,
and vessels moving through these channels could be kept under much
better control. Such a scheme, however, would probably require the


approval of the Canadian authorities before it could be carried into effect.
It may also be stated that in the disposition of dredged material, the
dumping grounds have been generally selected with the view of maintain-
ing the original cross-sectional area of the river, where this was prac-
ticable.
The contracts for the Livingstone Channel require its completion by
the beginning of the season of 1912; and, from the progress made, the
entire work should be completed before that time. Upon the comple-
tion of this improvement, it is intended that downbound traffic shall
make use of this new route while upbound traffic will use the present
channel. This arrangement will eliminate the danger of collision be-
tween vessels which now constantly threatens. Such an accident in this
narrow channel would probably block commerce entirely until the ves-
sels were removed. It is believed, however, that the completion of this
work together with the completion of improvements in progress at other
critical places will provide amply for safe navigation.
The writer is unwilling to close this paper without acknowledgement
of the very efficient service of many of the men conected with him on
this work. A number of these men have come from these halls and by
their ability, attentiveness to duty, and general deportment are giving
strong testimony as to what the University of Michigan has done for
them.


EDITORIALS
We are glad to announce that after this the Technic will be pub-
lished as a quarterly. This move has been considered for some time,
but until now, the boards have not seen their way clear to assume the
extra work that this will involve. We congratulate the new board for
the enthusiasm that they are showing in the work. The Technic board
will probably be reorganized and made larger, so that the work can be
divided up to a greater extent.
The growth of the Technic has been slow but sure. It is not gen-
erally known that the Technic is the oldest student publication on the
campus. It was first published in 1882, under the name of "Selected
Papers." In 1888 the name was changed to the present one by Prof.
G. S. Williams, who was then the editor. It was published as an annual
until 1905, when, under the editorship of Mr. Ralph Tinkham, it was
changed to a semi-annual. We hope that it will keep on expanding;
our one regret in connection with the editing of the book being that
we did not contribute directly to its expansion.
The Technic is now the only student publication that is not under
the supervision of the Faculty Board of Control. We are inclined to
take this as a compliment. It speaks well for the judgment and manage-
ment of the previous editors and business managers.

ADDITION TO THE NEW ENGINEERING BUILDING.
By Henry Clay Anderson, M.E., Junior Professor of Me-
chanical Engineering.
In The Technic of 1902, will be found a very interesting
article by Professor Dennison, describing the proposed New En-
gineering Building.
At that time the total number of students in the department
was four hundred and eighty-nine, which was a slight increase
over the preceding year. It seemed at that time a building to


accommodate between seven and eight hundred students, would
be adequate for many years to come, but the growth of the
Engineering Department has indeed been remarkable, and before
the building was completed, in 1904, the department numbered
eight hundred and twenty-three.
The year following, this number was increased to nine hun-
dred and ninety-eight, which necessitated holding some classes
in the halls and such other places as could be obtained, and each
year following has brought a steady increase, the total number
of students in the department for 1908-1909 being 1,380.
In order to accommodate this yearly increase, extra class
rooms were provided in the New Engineering Building, the Old
Engineering Building was remodelled, the Old Dental Building
moved over to the Engineering corner, remodeled into class and
drawing rooms for the Surveying Department, and the space
left vacant by the removal of the Surveying Department, was
turned into drawing and class rooms. This last change however
was only a temporary relief and the Board of Regents authorized
the building of an addition to the New Engineering Building,
which is nearing completion and will be ready for occupancy at
the beginning of the second semester of this year.
This addition extends from the north end of the New En-
gineering Building on East University Ave., being in plan 60 xi6o
ft., and to the west at the north end will extend a north wing
60x60 ft. This extension conforms in height and architecture
with the original building. With this addition the Engineering
Building will have a frontage of about 375 ft. on East University
Ave., and about 174 ft. on South University Ave. The original
building contains about 1,500,000 cu. ft. of space; the new addi-
tion adds about 750,000 cu. ft. of space, making a total of 2,250,-
000 cu. ft.
The first floor contains an addition to the Mechanical Labora-
tory, locker room, a portion of the Naval Tank and the Electrical
Laboratory. Provision has also been made that at a compara-
tively small cost, the Naval Tank can be extended 60 ft. in length.
The second floor contains class rooms, a small Chemical Lab-
oratory, an instrument room, small shop, one large drawing room,
Catalogue files, vaults and instructors' studies.
The Administrative Offices of the Engineering Department


will be moved from the Old Engineering Building, and Dean
Cooley's office will be located in the north end of this new addi-
tion. Dean Cooley's present offices will be turned over to the
department library.
The third floor contains two large drawing rooms, several
class rooms, and a large lecture room 60 x 60.
The fourth floor contains three large drawing rooms and sev-
eral class rooms. This new addition has provided ten additional
class rooms, six additional drawing rooms and several additional
studies for instructors.
The building is heated by direct radiation and ventilated by a
fan or blower, located on the second floor, delivering about 2,000
cu. ft. per occupant per hour into the various rooms throughout
the building.
An exhaust fan located on the fourth floor, pulls the foul air
from the various rooms discharging same through a large ven-
tilating shaft extending above the roof of the building. The ven-
tilating and fresh air ducts are located along the ceiling over
each corridor. The fresh air and vent openings into each room
are equipped with dampers, which are operated by damper regu-
lators, these damper regulators are controlled and operated by
compressed air, and may be opened or closed by a switch in the
compresesd air line, located in each room. By this arrangement,
the ventilation can be turned on or off by the instructor using
the room. All of the direct radiation is equipped with automatic
temperature regulation, maintaining at all times a temperature
of yo° in the rooms. By placing the fresh air and vent ducts
along the ceiling over each corridor, all vertical and fresh air
vent flues usually built into the walls of the building have been
entirely omitted, thereby making excellent blackboard space in
all class rooms. The blackboards throughout the building will be
of slate.
The lighting system is modern in every respect, all rooms are
equipped with Tungsten lamps and Holophane reflectors.
Judging from the past growth of the Engineering Depart-
ment, it would not be surprising within a few years to find the
new building inadequate to accommodate the students.


DESCRIPTION OF THE CHEMICAL BUILDING OF THE
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN.
PRELIMINARY CONSIDERATIONS.
The general arrangement has resulted from an attempt to
meet certain requirements, some of which are common to all
chemical laboratories, and some of which are local, which re-
quired the following provisions to be made:
i. A fire-proof building with corridors and stairs so arranged that
in case of fire or accident there would always be a clear way of egress
from any part of the building.
2. A grouping of the work into departments so that each head of a
department should be as closely as possible in touch with the work for
which he is responsible.
3. Laboratory facilities for 600 to 700 students each semester in
elementary general chemistry, and qualitative analysis.
4. Laboratories for quantitative analysis, organic chemistry and
pharmacy which should accommodate 50 to 75 students each.
5. Smaller advanced laboratories for a wide variety of work.
6. A library with shelves for 10,000 books and seats for nearly 100
students.
7. Hoods in each laboratory with individual flues running unbroken
through the roof.
8. Large lecture rooms on the ground floor, so as to avoid crowds
on the upper floors.
9. An adequate system of nlechanical ventilation.
10. A visible and easily removed system of plumbing.
11. An arrangement for receiving and dispensing supplies which
should serve the various laboratories conveniently, and with a minimum

The building is located on the east side of the proposed
"Mall," which is to be an important feature in the campus of
the future and which will run from the library building north-
erly to North University Avenue. The building is rectangular
in shape, its west side, 230 feet in length, facing the Mall, and
its north side, 130 feet in length, facing North University Ave-

nue in line with Barbour Gymnasium. It is four stories in
height, each story being 13 feet il/&gt; inches in the clear, with
the exception of the north and south ends of the top floor where
the ceiling has been omitted, so that the additional height of the
attic has been gained. The first floor is 18 inches below the
grade level, and there is no basement except in the center of the
building. The attic slopes from a height of seven feet at the
highest point to four at its lowest and is not useful except for
storage purposes. The total height of the building is sixty-four
feet from the grade line to the top of the parapet wall; the total
floor area is 104,500 square feet; and the cubic contents, 1,666,-
000 cubic feet. The building contains 125 rooms.
The outside walls are built of brick faced with "Iron Spot"
vitreous brick of slightly varying shades of brown laid up in ce-
ment mortar with recessed joints in straight bond. P&gt;uff Bed-
ford limestone with tooled face is used for the grade and belt
courses, for the main entrance and for the bases and cap stones
of piers. The cornice and frieze are of terra cotta of the same
shade and texture as the limestone. All of the windows are
glazed with plate glass, and the exterior of the building has been
so designed as to admit a maximum of light.
The entire foundation of the building is of concrete; the out-
side walls and those of the courts are brick; the columns and
beams of reinforced concrete; the floors of reinforced concrete
and tile; and the roof of the same material, covered with com-
position roofing. The building is thus entirely fire-prooff in its
construction, but as a further safeguard is divided into five parts
by fire walls extending from the ground through all stories and
through the roof. The interior partitions throughout are built
of hard-burned hollow brick, and are in general only four inches
thick. The furnace and hood flues are built of the same material
and are provided with lining of vitreous tile except where fire
brick is needed. The interior finish is of the simplest, almost all
the floors and ceilings being finished in cement.
HEATING AND VENTILATION.
The laboratory is heated by a combined direct and indirect
system, the heat lost through the walls and windows being re-


placed by direct radiation. There are 15,773 square feet of direct
radiation, the greater part of which is placed along the outside
walls. The fresh air brought into the building is heated to
proper temperature before it is supplied to the various rooms.
There is a system of automatic temperature regulation with one
or more thermostats in each room, which controls the amount of
steam admitted to both the direct and indirect radiators.
The building is ventilated by means of eight fans, which sup-
ply a total of 199,000 cubic feet of air per minute to the various
rooms. Three exhaust fans remove 10,000 cubic feet of air per
minute from the toilet rooms, hydrogen sulphide generating
room, and the lecture tables and hoods in the lecture rooms.
ELECTRIC LIGHTING AND POWER.
There are 302 incandescent circuits in the building, supplied
from sixteen distributing panels enclosed in iron cabinets. All
ventilating fans, the elevator, and all other devices in the build-
ing requiring motor power are operated by electric motors. The
■electricity used for light and power comes from the central sta-
tion on the campus.
There are, in addition, a number of experimental circuits for
charging storage batteries, distributing current from the same,
and for electrolytic and electric furnace work.
PLUMBING.
There is a system of pipe trenches running around the first
floor just within the outside walls, which connects with the gen-
eral tunnel system of the University, and carries all electric wires,
steam, gas, water, compressed air and waste pipes. From this
trench groups of risers mount to the various laboratories. There
are 274 units of laboratory working tables in the building, each ac-
commodating from one to twelve students, and 112 hoods. All of
the tables and hoods have plumbing, and it requires 221 soap
stone sinks to supply the building. These sinks are connected
with drain lines by extra strong lead connections so as to make
the repairs as few as possible. In addition, the tables are all de-
signed with removable cupboards underneath them so that the
whole of the plumbing system may be exposed and readily re-


paired. All water and steam risers are jacketed so that there
will be no condensation of moisture to drip from them.
The fire protection of the building consists of a system of
4 inch mains with five risers, in connection with which on each
floor there are five hose racks, each containing seventy-five feet
(.f 2 inch linen fire hose. The system has a constant pressure
supply from the city, and four connections for city steamers ort
the outside.


There is a separate system of mains and drop risers which
conveys hydrogen sulphide from its generating room in the attic
to all of the main laboratories and most of the private research
rooms.
All pipes carrying water, gas, steam, compressed air or hy-
drogen sulphide are provided with T's just below each ceiling
and above each floor. These T's if not at present needed are
plugged to allow future connections to be made when desired,
without the necessity of taking down any pipes.
The sanitary system consists of eighteen water-closets and
eleven urinals, all of the most approved patterns.
COST OF BUILDING.
The original contract for the building called for all struc-
tural work and complete heating system, all wiring and all plumb-
ing, including all piping, cocks, sinks, and waste pipes on the
laboratory tables, but it did not include the wood work of these
tables. The cost of the building as shown by the original con-
tract is given below:
Cost of building $181,108.75
Cost of heating plant 35,687.00
Cost of plumbing 18,181.65
Cost of wiring 12,200.00
Total cost of building and equipment $247,177.40
Total cubic contents of building 1,666,000 cu. ft.
Cost of building, per cu. ft (cents) 10.85
Cost of equipment, per cu. ft. (cents) 3.95
Total cost, per cu. ft. (cents) 14.80

THE GEOLOGICAL ENGINEER.
By William Herbert Hobbs, Director of the Geological Lab-
oratory and Geological Museum.
So far as the writer is aware, the course in Geological Engi-
neering now offered at the University of Michigan is unique in
name if not in character. Mining engineers, it is true, have for
a good many years been trained at the special mining schools
■of New York (Columbia University), Michigan (at Houghton),
and Colorado (at Golden); as well as in mining engineering
courses offered at a number of universities. All these institu-
tions aim to equip the mining and metallurgical engineer—the
man called upon to give opinions concerning the value of mining
properties, but especially charged with the designing and opera-
tion of plants for the exploitation and reduction of ores. In or-
der to provide the extended technical knowledge of engineering
which such men require, the foundation work in geology and re-
lated subjects has generally been in these courses reduced to a
minimum.
To make clear the need for a course in geological engineering,
it will perhaps be best to review briefly the commercial develop-
ments of the last fifteen years in connection with an evolution of
opinion among leading mining men. With such men twenty
years ago the college-trained man found little favor. He was
generally regarded as too theoretical, and mining schools, in or-
der to find employment for their graduates, were forced to lay
more and more stress upon actual methods of mine operation
and on types of mining and metallurgical machinery. In many
cases the men who made their way up to the top, were trained
on the ground—apprenticed, as it were, to the work. Their suc-
cess it is easy to explain today, since they were the men of ex-
ceptional natural ability culled out from an army of workers.
They all possessed that quality which in the strong if inelegant
New England expression is "gumption." It seems certain that
they would have gone even farther had they been given a satis-
factory University training.
The period of general consolidation in business, which began


some fifteen years ago, has nowhere been more marked than in
the mining industry. What had before been small mining com-
panies with few properties only, now swollen through consoli-
dation began to look about to increase their holdings. For this
work they needed not so much the mining engineer as the geolo-
gist and civil engineer—in short, the geological engineer. He
might perhaps be called as well an explorer engineer, for his
task was often in large part the examination of new or little
known districts in respect to topography, geology, possible land
or water communications, etc.
The new demand of the mining companies for geologists has
tempted many men whose lives have hitherto been given to inves-
tigation for state and government surveys, to accept the much
larger salaries offered them by corporations. Room being va-
cated at the top, the general advance has made openings for
younger men at the bottom.
The interest in conservation, which has been fostered under
the Roosevelt administration, has led to a careful mapping of the
coal lands of the national domain. This work calls especially
for men who have a training in civil engineering as well as a
thorough knowledge of mineralogy and geology. Thus far the
work has been largely reconnaisance, but if the government in-
sists upon retaining control of the public coal lands—as it ought
and probably will—many expert geological engineers will be
needed by the nation in order to accurately determine the condi-
tions under which exploitation of the coal in each district should
be permitted. From the side of the private companies who ex-
ploit these resources, other men are sure to be in demand.
The other great source of motive power is falling water, and
with the probable exhaustion of coal supplies during the next
century, the sources of water supply must assume an ever in-
creasing importance. In fact, it is hardly too much to say that
the great struggle of the near future is to be for retention by
the people of their inherent rights in this great source of revenue.
The present congress will almost certainly be forced to take up
consideration of the question. Here the services of the hydro-
graphical engineer will be all important. In addition to the es-
sential knowledge of hydraulics, his training should include a
study of the geological conditions which fix the boundaries of the


•3
drainage basins and which bring about changes in drainage. The
effect of climate and of forest cover in regulating the proportion
of "run off," and like questions he will be forced to deal with.
More and more the work which heretofore has been divided be-
tween and often largely duplicated by the different government
bureaus, will in the future be directed by a single bureau through
men whose training is correspondingly broad.
The course in geological engineering at the University of
Michigan is planned to cover a period of six years; the degree of
Bachelor of Science in Preparation for Engineering being con-
ferred at the end of the fourth year, and the degree of Master
of Geological Engineering on completion of the course. For the
first two years the work is the same as for all other engineering
students who follow the six year course, namely: English and
rhetoric, 12 hours; history, 8 hours; modern language, 16 hours;
mathematics (algebra, analytic geometry, calculus and mechan-
ics), 26 hours; chemistry, 4 hours; and physics, 10 hours. Thus
about one-half of the work of the first two years is given to the
humanities, for it is learned by experience that such training
omitted at this time is in the majority of cases never made up.
The other half of the time during the first two years is devoted
to studies which are the foundation stones of those that follow
in subsequent years. For the remaining years of the course
studies group themselves as follows: modern language and cul-
tural electives, 19 hours; chemistry, 4 hours; metallurgy and as-
saying, 5 hours; mathematics, 6 hours; mechanics, 8 hours; hy-
draulics and water supplies, 6 hours; surveying, 15 hours; other
civil engineering courses, 8 hours; thermodynamics, 7 hours;
electrical engineering, 8 hours; general and mining law, 5 hours;
astronomy, 3 hours; and courses in the geological sciences, 47
hours. These latter courses in geological science are mineralogy,
11 hours; geology, 28 hours; and petrography, 8 hours.
Among the mining states of the Union, Michigan takes a prom-
inent place. The area surrounding the Upper Laurentian Lakes
is the greatest iron producing region of the world, and the Ke-
weenaw Peninsula of Michigan has long been famous as a great
copper district. In the past the University of Michigan has had
a small geological department only, and has therefore been un-
able to offer extended courses in economic geology. On the other


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
hand, her near neighbor, the University of Wisconsin, has given
special prominence to such courses and has in consequence sent
out graduates who by their success have done much to create a
demand for other men of their type. The names and present po-
sitions of what might be termed a single generation of Wiscon-
sin geologists—men who were in college work at the same time
is far more eloquent than extended argument:
Mark Newman, geologist, U. S. Steel Corporation, Duluth, Minn.
E. E. Ellis, chief geologist, U. S. Steel Corporation in the South (Tennes-
see Coal and Iron Co., etc.)
Carl Zapffe, geologist for the Northern Pacific Railroad.
J. H. Warner, geologist of the Pittsburg and Montana Co., Butte, Mont.
H. Buehler, state geologist of Missouri.
W. O. Hotchkiss, state geologist of Wisconsin.
R. C. Allen, state geologist of Michigan and lecturer in economic geol-
ogy at the University of Michigan.
Guy Crane, geologist, Guggenheim interests in Missouri.
Sydney Ball and Arthur Smith, geologists of the Cole-Ryan Syndicate,
Africa.
W. N. Smith, Arthur Lewis and McCullough, geologists and engineers,
Lead and Zinc district of Wisconsin.
E. C. Harder, Frank Katz, H. Wegeman, Frank Van Horn and E. Sclutltz,
in economic or hydrographic work for the United States Geological
Survey.
The above list includes the names of those men only who
since their graduation have taken up such work as emphasizes
the importance of a combination of engineering with geological
studies. In most cases these men did not have the engineering
training while at the University, and have been obliged to learn
that part of their work through experience. No courses similar
to that in geological engineering here outlined were at the time
offered by any university, and their success would seem to indi-
cate that for the fields of endeavor which they entered, the
university training in geology was on the whole more important
than that in engineering. Men once placed in important positions
naturally recommend for important positions as they become va-
cant, men from their own Alma Mater or men whom they know
personally in preference to others. Wisconsin has thus already
acquired a long lead over Michigan which it will require years to
overcome under the best of circumstances. It seems only nat-


ural, however, that the University of Michigan should attempt to
supply these important servants in the great work which is now
progressing and is sure to continue within the mining region in
which her fortunes have been cast.


LEAKAGE IN SANITARY SEWERS.
By Edward Dunbar Rich, C.E., Assistant Professor of Civil
Engineering.
It is often surprising to note how little serious attention is
given the subject of leakage into sanitary sewers by village and
city officials and even by engineers.
There are two reasons for the present general apathy on this
question; first, the combined sewer preceeded, historically, the
separate system. In the construction of a combined sewer, little
care is necessary in keeping the joints tight because one function
of a storm sewer, or of one carrying both storm water and house
drainage, is to remove as much ground water and surface water
as possible, hence the more permeable the joints of such a sewer,
the better will its duties be performed. In many localities con-
tractors and engineers have been accustomed to the construction
of storm sewers or combined sewers before they have been called
upon to design or build sanitary sewers, and naturally the habit,
already formed, of paying little attention to the joints is bound
to have the effect of imperfect work when leakage is to be avoid-
ed. The contractor and inspector usually see only the upper
portion of the joint as made and when that looks well it is fair
for them to assume that the remainder is equally good; a con-
clusion which is almost invariably wide of the mark when the
ordinary cement joint is being used. When leakage is observed
during construction it is generally only that from a small length
of sewer and thus appears insignificant to the eye. The steeper
the grade on which it is flowing the less likely it will be to attract
attention on account of the small size of the stream, but the high
velocity clue to such a grade may make the discharge considerable.
Only a careful gauging of the flow can give an accurate idea of
what the leakage really is. The contractor, of course, is very
ready to belittle the leakage feature because it is money in his
pocket to be allowed to pass over joints which ought to be re-
paired. He is very apt to say, "There are only a few drops com-
ing in at that joint. What does that amount to?" In this con-
nection it should be mentioned that the joints are generally only


two feet apart and when each contributes its share the total soon
becomes a considerable quantity. These things may seem very
simple but are cited in order to point out, especially to beginners,
how important small matters are and to call attention to the
seemingly insignificant details which must be considered to reach
satisfactory results.
The second reason why leakage into sanitary sewers is an
important question is that, when sewage is to be treated or
pumped, any pure water which becomes mixed with the sewage
must go through the same processes of purification or pumping
as if it, in itself, had originally been sewage. Leakage, there-
fore, in any considerable quantity, adds unnecessary expense to
the cost of whatever treatment the sewage is to be given.
Let us consider how this phase of the question is likely to be
underrated or even overlooked entirely. When sewers were first
constructed to carry house flow it was considered sufficient to
discharge the sewage into any convenient stream. As the use
of sewers increased this mode of disposal soon became a nuis-
ance in large towns owing to the rapid pollution of streams,
The next step was to carry the flow, by means of trunk sewers,
to a more distant point. At that time it was supposed that sew-
age, diluted with stream water, would soon be purified by the
action of natural forces. This has proved true only to a limited
extent and as sanitary science has advanced, the practise of dis-
charging raw sewage into streams is becoming less and less tol-
erable. Health Boards generally are taking a lively interest in
the problem and we may logically look forward to the time,
probably at no very distant date, when laws will be passed quite
extensively prohibiting the discharge of raw sewage into streams
or lakes and perhaps into tidal waters except at a great distance
from shore. Treatment of sewage, then, must be the result of
such legislation and leakage into the system will immediately en-
ter into the problem as an item of dollars and cents. Take for
example the City of Ann Arbor. We have a separate system dis-
charging directly into the Huron River and the only disadvantage
of leakage at the present time is a question of the capacity of the
sewers necessary to care for the added flow due to that cause.
The present discharge is not of sufficient volume to pollute the
river to such an extent as to be a nuisance to towns below us,


THE MICHIGAN TECH NIC
but suppose it became necessary for a water supply to be taken
from the Huron just east of Ann Arbor; the immediate result
would be that all our sewage, house flow and leakage, would have
to be treated in such a way as not to injure the supposed water
supply. Then the element of leakage, which now is harmless,
would become an important matter at once. It will be seen, there-
fore, that the only safe proceedure, from an engineering or an
economic standpoint, is to cut down the leakage during construc-
tion to the least possible amount for it is next to impossible to
secure any appreciable decrease after a system has been installed.
Let us now consider to what extent leakage affects the volume
of flow in sanitary sewers.
The inflow takes place in two ways which should be guarded
against separately but the results of which must be cared for to-
gether. First: Infiltration of ground-ivatcr. This occurs slow-
ly and is fairly constant from day to day but varies with the de-
gree of saturation of the soil, being greatest in spring and least
in autumn. The maximum will occur after the melting snow
and spring rains have had sufficient time to penetrate to the depth
of the sewers and may be expected about May. The minimum
will occur at the beginning of the fall rains, or about November.
Infiltration depends; first, upon the head of ground-water which
may vary several feet during the year; second, on the size of the
pipe, varying approximately as the square of the diameter; third,
on the length of the sewer; fourth, on the material of which the
sewer is built; and fifth, on the kind and quality of the joints.
The experience of various cities indicates that leakage attri-
butable to this cause may vary from 5% to 30% of the capacity
of the conduits. The amount is generally expressed in gallons
per day (twenty-four hours) per mile of sewer. The following
table will give an idea of its extent and variation:

The 33" x 44" sewer at Altoona was composed of brick and
concrete. The leakage indicated occurred upon completion of
the work but was subsequently reduced by repairs. The last
item in the table includes the previous one and it will be noted
that the addition of four miles of brick sewer increased the leak-
age rate on the system about two and one-half times. It should
be stated that much of this sewerage system was laid under very
difficult conditions. Considerable quicksand was encountered and
some of the sewers were laid under a twenty-foot head of ground-
water. A full discussion of this work may be found in the Trans-
actions of the American Society of Civil Engineers, volume 25,
page 125.
The Joint Trunk Sewer of New Jersey affords a good oppor-
tunity for the study of leakage. This system, completed in 1904,
empties into Staten Island Sound near the southern end of the
City of Elizabeth and carries the flow of the following Munici-
palities:—Part of the City of Elizabeth, Roselle Park, Vails-
burgh, Part of the City of Newark, West Orange, South Orange,
Milburn Township, including Wyoming, Milburn and Short
Hills, and Summit. The estimated tributary population at the
time of completion was 50,000 but the sewer was designed for
three times that amount to provide for the rapid growth of these
suburban communities. The total length of mains and laterals is
about 150 miles and it is constructed mostly through glacial drift
and considerable quicksand. The system was designed for a leak-
age of 33 1-3% of the total capacity but on completion only about
10% was found to be required by infiltration. As a result of
careful study, Alexander Potter, Chief Engineer, concluded that
with rigid inspection it is not safe to count on less than about
25,000 gallons per mile per day with cement joints but with sul-
phur-sand joints it may be reduced to about 5.000 gallons per
mile per day.
The second source of inflow is termed Storm-water Leakage
and is that which reaches the sewers within a few hours after
the storm begins. This class will, of course, include some ground-
water but only that which passes rapidly into the pipes.
It enters; first through manhole caps; second .through roof
leaders either directly or indirectly; third, through leaky joints


of both mains and connections; and fourth, through leaky brick
work of manholes.
The necessity for vent-holes in manhole caps has been over-
estimated which has led to an extreme in the matter of perfora-
tions, some being little better than a grating. The idea has pre-
vailed in some localities that unless sewers were thoroughly ven-
tilated the gas forming in the conduits would force the house
traps and escape into buildings. The fallacy of this is easily ex-
posed by the infrequency of complaints of this character at times
when a sudden and heavy fall of snow completely seals all sewer
openings and keeps them so for several days. Mr. Potter has
estimated that about one gallon per minute per manhole is an
average rate of leakage for twenty-four hours but the flood flow
for a period equal to the duration of a given storm might show
a rate three or four times that of the daily average assuming
that this leakage would naturally follow about the same law as
that observed concerning rain-fall. Leakage due to this cause
should be provided against by reducing perforations to a mini-
mum and by so placing manholes and grading around them that
rain and snow water may flow from instead of toward them.
Many towns having a system of sanitary sewers do not pro-
hibit the direct connection of roof leaders with the sewers. A
moderate amount of roof water is a benefit, provided no pump-
ing or treatment is being carried on, because it affords a free
flushing with clean water as often as a rain occurs but the diffi-
culty arises in having so many of such connections as to overtax
the capacity of the system and also in getting them disconnected
when treatment or pumping must be undertaken. The safest
course is to prevent the practise by ordinance and then enforce
the law. The indirect method of connecting roof leaders to the
sewer is to conduct their discharge into a blind drain laid in the
same trench as the sewer connection from which it surely and
quickly finds its way into the pipes through leaky joints.
The joint most commonly used for pipe sewers is made by
first caulking into the bell of the pipe one or two strands of
oakum which has been soaked in a thin mixture of pure cement
and water and then filling the remainder of the joint with a mor-
tar composed of two parts of sand and one part of cement.
When carefully made and used under favorable conditions this


joint is satisfactory but its failings are soon evident when used
under adveise conditions. To obtain the best results, the tamp-
ing of the joint filling, both oakum and mortar, must be solidly
done and the exterior must be wiped and rubbed to a smooth
surface by means of a rubber mitten or similar device to insure
an impervious surface. These precautions are often neglected
by careless workmen and if water is present at the bottom of the
trench, it wets the mortar, causing it to fall away from the pipe
before it has had time to set. As this always occurs on the under
side of the pipe it is seldom seen by those in charge and the re-
sult is a hole which admits water freely. This can be prevented
to some extent by tying a, strip of cloth around the joint to hold
the mortar in place. Satisfactory results may be obtained in this
manner if not much water is present. The best method for use
in wet trenches is to support the pipe on timbers a little above
the bottom of the trench and pump or drain the water away from
the joints until after the mortar has hardened but even then
proper results are not assured. The writer has seen a section of
eighteen inch sewer, laid in a thirteen foot cut in quicksand,
treated.in this way. The pumping was continued till the mortar
seemed to have thoroughly set when- backfilling was ordered.
The ground-water had a head of about three feet over the top
of the pipe and as soon as it came to its level every joint in the
thirty foot section leaked and one ran a stream nearly as large as
a lead-pencil. Undoubtedly the best joint for use in wet trenches
is the sulphur-sand joint which consists of equal parts of sulphur
and fine sand, melted and poured in the same manner as the lead
of a water-pipe joint. The material may be obtained in market
ready for use or it can be mixed on the work without the aid of
skilled labor. This method fills the joints equally all round and
the filling cools and is finally set in a few minutes. The process
has the further advantage of allowing two or three joints to be
made on the surface after which the combined lengths are low-
ered into the trench and connected to those already laid.
It is important that manholes should be substantially con-
structed; otherwise much leakage takes place through the joints
between the brick or even through the pores of the brick. The
writer once inspected a newly built manhole during a severe
storm and found streams coming through the brick work some as


large as two fingers and many of them spurting to the center of
the manhole; indeed the whole interior resembled a shower bath.
This was rather an extreme case for in addition to the bad mason
work, the back filling of the trench on either side of the manhole
was more than half of rock without sufficient earth to fill the
voids. A subsequent inspection in storm time showed that the
leakage had been reduced to a small amount by the clay soil hav-
ing been washed into the voids of the stones and brick work of
the manhole. The only sure way to cut off leakage through man-
hole walls is to have them thoroughly plastered on the outside
and allow nothing to come in contact with the plastering until it
will resist the blow of a small stone thrown against it.
Beginning on July 15, 1905, the writer carried on for nearly
two years a series of gaugings of the flow of the sewers of Sum-
mit, N. J., in order to determine the combined effect upon the
system of storm and ground-water leakage. At that time all the
sewage of the city flowed by gravity to a disposal plant on the
banks of the Passaic River. The portion of the city then sew-
ered was not tributary by gravity to the Joint Trunk Sewer and,
as the State Board of Health had condemned the disposal plant,
the question arose as to whether the flow from the old sewers
should be pumped over the hill, which involved a lift of about
210 feet, or be carried through the hill in a trunk sewer about
three miles long, over a mile of which was to be in tunnel of a
maximum depth of nearly 200 feet. In either case it became nec-
essary to know the maximum flow and the variations in quantity
to be dealt with. The results of these measurements showed
very clearly the extravagant waste of money in pumping and of
investment in unnecessarily large machinery and mains, pro-
duced by excessive leakage. A diagram of the flow for the first
year accompanies this article, a glance at which indicates very
plainly every rain of any account that occurred during the year.
The gaugings were made at the inlet to the disposal plant by
means of a weir, readings being taken every hour night and day
during the year. The results were calculated in gallons per
twenty-four hours from noon of one day to noon of the next
day and are so plotted. The minimum daily flow (observed dur-
ing the second year) was about 117,000 gallons, the average for
the first year was 342,500 or nearly three times the minimum,


while the maximum was about 1,125,000 gallons or nearly ten
times the minimum and about four times the average. In addi-
tion to the enormous increase in flow at storm time, the diagram
indicates, by the downward trend of the line, the gradual de-
crease of leakage due to infiltration of ground-water, beginning
late in April and continuing till the last of November.
The pumping project was finally adopted and, as the circum-
stances were such that the maximum flow had to be pumped
nearly as fast as it arrived at the pumping station, it became
necessary to install duplicate pumps, to guard against accidents,
each having a capacity of two million gallons per day. If all the
leakage due to surface water could have been eliminated, pumps
of two-thirds that size would have proved ample for a time at
least equal to the life of the pumps. It should also be stated
that the effect of a storm was felt at the weir within an hour
after the beginning of the rain and sometimes lasted for two or
three days after its end.
It is hoped that the foregoing may influence any reader who-
is or may become connected with the design or construction of
sanitary sewers to undertake a careful consideration and investi-
gation of the amount of leakage likely to occur.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
A STEAM-JET SMOKE CONSUMER.
By S. T. Mudge, Instructor in Mechanical Engineering.
That almost any grade of soft coal may be burned without
the production of objectionable smoke has been repeatedly de-
monstrated in the operation of well designed boiler plants.
Smokelessness has generally been secured by carrying on the
combustion of the fuel in a fire-brick chamber partly separated
from the tube spaces. This insures a complete combustion of the
hydro-carbon gases, which are distilled from the fresh coal. In
the common design of furnace these hydro-carbons are extin-
guished by contact with the cold tube surfaces, and incomplete
combustion and smoke result. In many old plants it would be im-
possible, or at least very expensive, to provide a fire-brick com-
bustion-chamber to secure smokelessness. It is the object of this
article to describe an apparatus, designed by Professor Cooley,
which secures this result, and which may be applied to any fur-
nace at very little cost.
This device consists of several steam jets arranged inside,
and just over the fire-door, and inclined so as to strike the fire
about one-third the length of the grate from the front. A cam
on the fire-door turns steam on to the jets when the door is
opened and shuts it off when the door is closed. A hand oper-
ated valve is also provided to shut off steam when the door is
opened for inspection only. The action of the steam-jets is to
induce a strong draft of air through the fire-door, over and
through the coal on the grate, and thence into the tube space.
If now, coal is added, the distilled hydro-carbons are thoroughly
mixed with the incoming air and forced through the incandescent
fuel on the grate, thus insuring rapid and complete combustion.
The floor is left open until most of the hydro-carbons are distilled,
which takes from three to eight minutes from the time of open-
ing. In an ordinary furnace, with induced or chimney draft,
when the door is opened there is a rush of cold air which passes
over the fire, does not aid combustion, but dilutes the flue gases
and chills the furnace. With this device however, all the air
■which enters is forced into the coal, thus aiding combustion and

increasing, instead of decreasing, the furnace temperature. From
this consideration we would expect a slightly higher evaporation
with the jets operating than without.
An experimental apparatus of this nature was placed on the
forty horse-power Sterling boiler last fall. The jets were 3/32"
in diameter, and three in number. Three jets of the same size
and controlled by the same valve were arranged to discharge into
a condenser, thus giving a means of measuring the steam con-
sumption of the apparatus. The coal burned was an Ohio soft
coal of the following analysis:
water 3.1%
volatile 32.8%
carbon 53.6%
ash 10.5%
This was the same coal that was used in the University power-
house last year and any Ann Arbor reside'nt will testify that it
was a good coal for smokeless combustion experiments. With
this equipment a series of tests were run by the engineering stu-
dents both with and without the consumer. The different tests
varied considerably as regards pressure, capacity, and draft, but
the method of firing was kept as near uniform as possible for
all tests. The fire was stoked every ten to fifteen minutes and,
on account of the heavy clinker formed, the fire had to be thor-
oughly cleaned two or three times during the test.
The results of these tests are given in the accompanying table.
As regards smoke consumption the apparatus was a complete
success. Upon putting on fresh coal there was a little yellow
smoke produced, but nothing that even the most consciencious
smoke inspector could complain of. Provided that the fire-door
was not closed too soon, this was the most smoke produced at
any time. The series of tests showed that slightly higher aver-
age evaporation was secured without the steam-jets working. A
study of the table however, will show that this is due more to
chance than to any effect of the consumer. The average steam
consumption of the steam jets was 2.7%. This was with an
evaporation of 5.85 lbs. of water from and at 2120 per lb. of
coal. Had the evaporation been 9 lbs., which is a good average
for boiler plants, the jet consumption would have been 1.75% of
the output.


Some secondary effects of this device will be of interest to
the student. Figure III shows the effect of stoking on the stack
temperature. Curves I and II are with the consumer, and III
and IV are without. The cross indicates the time at which the
door was shut. I and II show very clearly that there is no chill-
ing of the furnace due to the door remaining open. In one test
with the consumer, a sample of flue gas was taken after the fire-
door had been open 5 minutes and showed 7% of CO._,. This is
higher than the average CO„ of any test, showing that there is no
excessive dilution of the products of combustion. The rise in
temperature, due to opening the door, suggests a possible means
of forcing the boiler capacity. With a light draft the steam jets
were powerful enough to force the flame through the grate
to the ash-pit. This, of course, will make the grates burn out
more quickly although they have a chance to cool between each
opening of the door.- In practice however, the force of the jet
can be so proportioned to the draft that the flame will not be
forced all the way through the bed of coal.
A smoke consumer of this type can be built out of pipe-fittings
and placed on any boiler at a cost of not more than ten dollars.
Let me repeat in conclusion, that this device is not proposed as
the best solution of the smoke problem for a new plant, but
rather as a cheap, satisfactory equipment for existing plants with
badly designed furnaces.


THE AMERICAN HIGH SPEED RUNNERS FOR WATER
TURBINES.
By S. J. Zowski.
COPYRIGHT, I908, BY S. J. ZOWSKI.
Looking at a modern American standard runner for a water
turbine one is liable to wonder why the design of such runners
is considered to be one of the most difficult problems in hydraulic
engineering. The forms of the runners are so natural, the buck-
ets and their curvature so simple, that "we fail to see where the
pretended difficulties are." As is usual in such cases, we forget
here again that there is always a direct proportion between the
simplicity of a machine and the amount of brainwork and time
necessary to produce the same. A brief history of the evolution
of the American turbine or a glance at the reports of the numer-
ous tests made in the Holyoke testing flume would convince us
of this fact. Indeed, the American standard runners, as they are
manufactured now, represent a great amount of hard and earn-
est work. Hundreds of tedious and expensive experiments, with
many a failure and success, had to be made—an experience of
almost half a century had to be aggregated first, before this mod-
ern runner type was produed.
The aim was, first, of course, a good efficiency. But this was
not all. Already in the early eighties—at a time when the Euro-
pean engineers still were questioning the advantages of the radial
inward flow turbine— there were in this country wheels of this
type, which yielded efficiencies up to 84%, acording to the tests
made in Holyoke. And yet since that time remarkable progress
has been made. Following the general tendency of modern en-
gineering, the speed and capacity of the turbines had to be stead-
ily increased. That for the turbine designer this resulted in new
difficulties is evident, as high speed calls for small dimensions,
while high capacity calls for large dimensions, and consequently
the increase of both is possible only to a certain limit.
The purpose of this study is to show how far the American
manufacturers of water turbines have come in this respect and
also to compare the results which were obtained by their various


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
runner types. The accuracy of this study is naturally limited by
the accuracy of the data, which were accessible to the writer,
and which were taken from the guarantees of the different con-
cerns. But as these guarantees are based on careful tests made
in the Holyoke testing flume, and as these tests are considered
official in this country, also the results of the following study can
be considered reliable. The comparison at least will be accurate,
because, if mistakes in the testing of the wheels be made (and
some engineers, especially in Europe, believe that the Holyoke
tests are not quite reliable regarding the actual discharge) the
same mistakes owuld be made on all runners.
NOTATION.
To get a proper basis for this study, some of the principal
turbine formulae must be recalled and some new ones derived.
The notation is the same, which the writer uses in his lectures on
water turbines at the University of Michigan.
H-P = effective power of the runner.
Ar = speed of the runner in R. P. M.
Q = discharge of the runner in cubic feet per second.
H — net head in feet acting upon the turbine = gross head minus all
losses in head race, conduit and tail-race.
£ = hydraulic efficiency of the turbine,
(i—£) H = head lost inside of turbine itself due to friction, whirls
and shocks.
Di = mean entrance diameter of runner in feet.
B = height of guide case in feet.
a, = angle between entrance speed and peripheal speed at Ds.
ft = bucket angle at D,.
Ci = real entrance speed at Di.
Wi = relative entrance speed at Di.
i\ = peripheral speed at Di.
ct = radial entrance speed at D, — radial component of c, see Figs.
i and 2.
SPEED.
All modern American runners are of the radial inward flow
type, working with pressurehead. The definition of the "pres-
surehead turbine" or "pressure turbine" (so-called reaction tur-
bine) is: "The water enters the runner and flows through the
same with a ecrtain pressurehead, as the whole available head is
not turned into speed at the entrance. The real entrance speed


c, is smaller than the spouting velocity. A pressurehead is left,
to be used for the acceleration of the flow of the water through
the runner."
The regulation of the hydrodynamic conditions in the runner,
for a flow either with or without pressurehead, is possible by the
choice of the angles fix and c^.
If the entrance into the runner is "shockless," and the dis-
charge is "perpendicular," (real discharge speed perpendicular
to the corresponding peripheral speed) then
&gt;|e*"&gt;/
sin /?, (I)
sin ( Ji — &lt;ii) cos O]

Both c1 and f, are functions of the angles a! and f}t for a given
head. The speed cx can naturally never exceed the spouting ve-
loicty y/2geH. It would become equal to this velocity if
! sin±_ „lgH=\gtH
y sin dh — ai) cos ci y v
or if
Pi = 2a,
For all angles fiy which are larger than 2alt the speed (^ will
be smaller than the spouting velocity, hence the turbine will be a
pressure turbine.
For a pressureless turbine the peripheral speed would be
1 COS a,' *
This is variable only within very small limits, as cosa, varies only
a little for the values of at which are used in practice. Hence
the peripheral speed of the pressureless turbine is practically
given by the head, and consequently the speed N (R.P.M.) can
be varied only by variation of the runner diameter Dx. As prac-
tical reasons restrict both the increase and decrease of Dlt the
speed of a pressureless turbine is variable only within narrow
limits. This is one of the main reasons why nowdays pressure


THE MICHIGAN TECHKIC
turbines occupy the first place, and pressureless turbines (Im-
pulse wheels and Schwamkrug-turbines) are used only when ab-
solutely necessary. The speed of the pressure turbine can be
varied not only by variation of the runner diameter but also, and
very effectively, by variation of the angles y3x and e^. Combining
both means, it is easy to vary the speed of a pressure turbine for
a given head and capacity in the ratio of 6 : i.
To show how the angles ttl and /?t affect the peripheral speed
vx the factor

of equation (2) has been represented by a series of curves. Fig-
ure 3 gives the values of this factor for a series of constant
bucket angles pi with variable angles ax. Figure 4 gives the same
values for a series of constant angles ax with variable angles plm

for all values of 0l. For all angles pi &lt; 900 the value of the rad-
ical is smaller than 1; for all angles jiy &gt; 900 its value is larger
than 1.
As a low or medium head turbine must, as a rule, be designed
for a relatively high speed, all American standard runners, being
built for low or medium heads, have /8, &gt; 900 and are "high
speed runners." Runners with /3X = 900 are called "medium
speed runners" and those with fi^ &lt; 900 are called "low speed
runners." See Figures 5, 6, 7.
Practical reasons, as for instance the necessity of an easy,
smooth and yet a short curvature of the bucket, are limiting the
increase of /J^ The value of j8imax=i35° will represent good
practice and will be found in many of the best American high
speed runners. The increase of angle at also increases the speed
z&gt;! for all angles /?, &gt; 900. But to avoid what is called overgat-
ing, it is advisable not to assume too high values for ot. Tests
show that the capacity of the runner reaches its maximum at a
certain gate opening. To open more, is not only useless, but even

wrong, as not only the output goes down, but also the efficiency.
Although the point of overgating may, by a proper design of the
runner, (at the least passage area) be moved upwards, it is not
advisable to depend on this too much. Less efficiency than that
expected does not disappoint the turbine buyer as much, as when
the turbine is found to give less than the expected maximum
power. It is not wise to make a, larger than 40°.
The hydraulic efficiency may be assumed between 0.82 and
0.84. For £ = 0.83, \/fg= 5.167 and
sin (,1, — «i __
Vi = 5-i67\ ——" V H
\ sin .&lt;! cos a!
Since for a given runner the value of the radical is a constant, we
may write
f. = if'XVH (3)
and A'v may be called the "speed constant."
For /3, = 135°, 04 = 40°, £ = 0.83, A'v = about 7.0. For giv-
en runners, where Du H and N are known, the speed constants
may be calculated as follows:
vi * Dj N
and thus the different runner types may be compared in reference
to speed. These constants will also show, whether a further in-
crease of the speed is possible or not. Should the speed constant
be considerably larger than 7, then it can be assumed with certain-
ty that either the guaranteed speed is higher than the best speed
(the best speed is the speed at which the runner yields the max-
imum efficiency) or that the nominal diameter of the runner is
larger than the mean diameter Dx.
CAPACITY.
The quantity of water discharging from a given opening in a
certain time, say in one sec, is Q = const. X ~\/H, if H is the
head at the center of the opening. Hence, for a given opening,


Q/y/H = constant. We call this constant the "specific discharge"
and use for the same the symbol:
Q
0,=—= cub. ft./sec. (5)
The specific discharge from an orifice is the discharge in cub.
feet per sec. when H = 1 ft.
Take into consideration the entrance area of the runner,
Ax — *D,B X &amp;,,
where klt being smaller than 1, is a factor, the addition of which
is necessary, in order to consider the decrease of the circumfer-
ence by the ends of vanes and buckets.
The speed of the stream, normal to this entrance area, is the
radial speed cT, which, like all speeds of a given runner—is in di-
rect proportion to y/H.
fr = *, V//
Passage area X speed of flow normal to the area = discharge.
Therefore
Q = Atcr = TtDSk&amp;s \IH.
Express the width of the guide case in parts of runner diameter
B = k,D,
(In runners of the same type k2 will be nearly the same for all
runner sizes.)
Then by substitution we obtain
Q — tA'WbVH — AW'v'tf, (6)
where /Cq =7rfe1/;2/i'3.
u- g &amp;
A"-A8, ~hl ~~ A* (7)
A.'n is the "capacity constant" of the runner. The capacity con-
stant of a runner is its specific discharge for a runner diameter
= ift.
In all runners of the same type K^ will be nearly the same,
hence the capacity constant is a criterion of the capacity of dif-
ferent runner types.

SPKKD AND CAPACITY.
Knowing the speed and capacity constants of different runners
and runner types, we are not yet able to say to what extent they
fulfill the requirements of highest speed with highest capacity.
We may have two runners with two different values of Kq
and Kv, and yet both runners may be equivalent, when we con-
sider capacity and speed together. Another criterion must be in-
troduced, which will be a proper combination of 7vq and Ky. This
combination could be made in various ways, but the most conven-
ient one was indicated by M. Baashuus and Professor Camerer
and may be derived as follows:

Kt may be called the "type constant" or "type characteristic"
of the runner. It is a combination of the speed and capacity con-
stant, and both determine the type of the runner. The conven-
ience of this constant will be apparent, when we write equation
8 in the following form:
,. .V 1 H-P
H v II K r
A't can be figured directly from the speed, power and head,
which data can be obtained easily and seldom differ from actual
values. No dimensions of the runner, neither the discharge nor
the efficiency need to be known, and yet the efficiency is consid-
ered, because the formula
At x 1' A'
contains A' which is a function of -q.
Turbines of the same capacity and speed constant, but with
different efficiencies, will have a different type characteristic.
Hence Kt is an absolute criterion for turbines in reference to the
aim, "highest speed and highest capacity with best efficiency."
The meaning of A't can be found bv assuming H-P = i and
H=i, then Kt=N (R.P.M.).
"The type characteristic of a runner is the speed in R.P.XI.
zchich would be attained by the runner, if it were reduced in all
dimensions to such an extent, as to develop r H-P ivhcn working
under the head H = i ft."
In Germany the term "specific speed" (spezifische Geschwin-
digkeit or spezifische Umlaufzahl) and the symbol Ar8 or h„ is
used for A't.
The writer prefers, however, not to use this term for the fol-
lowing reasons. The word specific discharge is used for Qi =


Q/yJH, the word specific power is used for H-P/H\/H, or for
the discharge and power under the head H = i ft. Hence spe-
cific speed should denote the speed at H = i ft.

As Nx is used very frequently, the term type characteristic
has been chosen for Kt.
SPEED, CAPACITY AND TYPE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE AMERICAN
HIGH SPEED RUNNERS.
I. THE DAYTON GLOBE IRON WORKS CO., DAYTON, OHIO.
The Dayton Globe Iron Works Co. is the manufacturer of the
world known American turbines. The last two types developed
by this concern are the New American and the Improved New
American turbine. The difference in the design of these two run-
ners is seen from figures No. 8, 9, 10, 11. In order to increase
the capacity, the height has been increased, and the entrance
edge inclined. Thus the mean diameter D, has been reduced and
speed increased, while the minimum passage area at "a" is kept
ample. The discharge end of the bucket has also been changed.
In order to increase the actual discharge area, and to so decrease
the discharge speed, the bucket has been drawn down and shaped
spoonlike at the discharge. The radius of the curvature of the
spoon at "b" however seems to be rather small. The outward
discharge could be made more effective by a larger spoon. Nev-
ertheless both the capacity and the efficiency of this runner are
very good.

bly larger than that corresponding to /?i=i35c and ^—40°.
As the speed N (R.P.M.) must be assumed to be correct, (is
based on Holyoke tests) and the angles /J, and al do not exceed
1350 and 40° respectively, (^1 is about 135° ; al seldom exceeds
35°), the discrepancy can be due only to the fact that the nom-
inal diameter is larger than the mean diameter Dv Measuring
several runners, the writer has found that the nominal diameter
is taken close to the fillet (see Fig. No. 9). The ratio of the
mean to the nominal diameter was found to be about 0.97, for
smaller runner sizes. For larger szes this ratio is somewhat
smaller.

to equip its turbines with the cylinder gate regulating device.
There are two patterns of the Victor runner Type A: the Stand-
ard Capacity and the Increased Capacity runner. Both have the
same speed, but the capacity is different.
One of the characteristic features of the Victor runner is its
large number of buckets. It is the opinion of the writer, how-
ever, that there are no reasons to use so many buckets, either for
strength or for efficiency. On the contrary, it is advisable to
reduce the number of buckets of low head runners, in order to
increase the capacity and avoid small widths of the chutes at the
runner hub. Tables III and IV have been calculated in the same
way as the preceding tables.

THE JAMES LEFFEI* AND CO., SPRINGFIELD, O.
The James Leffel &amp; Co. manufacture the well known Double
wheel, designed originally by James Leffel as a combination of
two runners, one being a pure radial, the other a radial and down-
ward discharge runner. To increase the capacity this runner had
to be bulged out more, and so the new Double wheel was brought
out, which, like all high speed runners, discharges both in central
and outward direction. The special feature of this Improved
Samson Wheel is the partition wall, subdividing the runner into
two sections. The upper half is a solid casting, the lower half
has steel plate buckets.
Although manufacturing reasons—such as the wish to use
some existing patterns or pattern parts—may have been prevail-
ing, it is more than doubtful whether the addition of the partition
wall is an advantage. Without going any further into this mat-
ter, only a few reasons for this opinion of the writer shall be
stated.
The partition wall increases the friction loss and decreases the
effective height of the runner and thus its capacity. Further, it
increases the possibility of clogging, and if not built so that it
coincides with the corresponding water flow lines, it will decrease
the capacity still more.
One advantage could be claimed, namely, that the regulation
by a cylinder gate will not affect the efficiency of the turbine very
much. But this would be true only for a small variation of load,
when the cylinder gate closes only the upper part of the runner.

From Table No. IX it appears that, similar to the Improved
New American runners, the nominal diameters are larger than
the real mean diameters. The values of the speed constant A'v
seem to be too large, and those of the capacity constant too small
for the large values of Kt.
The average values of the characteristic runner constants are:
Alcott High Duty Risdon
Special Double Capacity Leviathan
Capacity constant K&lt;, 2.25 1.7 2.96 ( ?)
Speed constant AN 5.46 5.9 7.47 (?)
Type characteristic Kt 46.7 43.8 74.1
The mean values of the Alcott High Duty Special ha\e been
calculated from values of runner diameters up to 48". The run-
ners 54", 60" and 66" diameter have a reduced capacity.
MORGAN SMITH CO., YORK, PA.
The Morgan Smith Co. manufactures the noted McCormick
and New Success turbines. Recently a new type has been put on
the market by this company under the name of the Smith tur-
bine. This new runner, as it can be seen from Table No. XII,
has attained somewhat higher values for A"t than those of the
Improved New American, which was the leading runner in this
respect until the Smith Turbine appeared.

The average values of the characteristic runners are:

THE WELLMAN-SEAVER-MORGAN COMPANY, CLEVELAND, OHIO.
The "Standard" runner manufactured by the Wellman-Sea-
ver-Morgan Co. is the Jolly McCormick runner. A table of the
characteristics and curves of this runner has been omitted, as they
are exactly the same as those of the McCormick runner, manu-
factured by the S. Morgan Smith Co. See Table No. X, and
curves, Fig. 25.
The Wellman-Seaver-Morgan Co. manuafctures also a "Spe-
cial" runner with increased capacity and increased speed. Judg-
ing from the test of a 33" turbine, the values of the character-
istic runner constants are:
Capacity constant Kv = 3.2.
Speed constant K* = 6.49.
Type characteristics Kt = 68.2.
Lately this company produced another remarkable runner
with the following characteristic constants:
Capacity constant Kn = 3.6 (3.96).
Speed constant A'v = 6.47.
Type characteristics Kt = 78.5.
whereby the value ATq = 3.6 corresponds to 80% efficiency, which
value was assumed as basis for all other runners. The value
^q = 3-96, corresponds to the actual discharge Ql = 2i and
actual best efficiency 86%.
Arranging now the various runner types according to their
type characteristics, we will have answered the question, how far
the different concerns have come in reference to the aim of high-
est capacity and highest speed with good efficiency. Table No.
XIII gives both the mean and the maximum values of Kt which
were reached by the various runners and the corresponding ca-
pacity and speed constants Kq and Ky.
As European engineers and European text books frequently
refer to the American high speed runners, and as it appears that
the information they have regarding the same is v'ery inaccurate,.

For clearness two sets of curves have been drawn, showing
the specific pow:er and speed of the various runner types. In
Fig. 27 the curves of the Improved Samson and Trump runner
have been omitted, as they would interfere with those of other
runners.
The curve of the Improved Samson runner, as can be seen
from the values of K^ in Table V, would almost coincide with
that of the Victor Standard Capacity runner. The curve of the
Trump runner with that of the Victor Increased Capacity. The
curve of the Leviathan runner has been drawn as dotted line,
because the nominal diameters of this runner type seem to be
larger than the real mean diameters and a correction, like with
the Improved New American, could not be made for lack of in-
formation. Judging from the value of Kt the curve should be
in neighborhood of those for the Smith and Improved New Amer-
ican runners.
For the same reasons, the speed curves of the Leviathan, Im-
proved Samson and Trump runners have been omitted in Fig.
No. 28.

At the end it may be emphasized that it was not the intention
of the writer to decide which runner type is best. To endeavor
to answer such a question would be absolutely wrong. There can
not be a runner which would be best for all conditions. In many
cases the best efficiency will be the deciding factor, but very fre-
quently the variation of the efficiency with the variation of load,
and sometimes the maximum capacity or the maximum speed wiU

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
ALUS-CHALMERS CO., MILWAUKEE, WIS.
The manufacture of hydraulic turbines was begun by the
Allis-Chalmers Company only six years ago. Following in the
beginning the European principle, turbines were designed to suit
given conditions and requirements in every instance. But the
advantage of standard turbines being fully appreciated, long and
■exhaustive studies have been made in this direcion by the com-
pany's engineers.
At the present time, the developing work on Allis-Chalmers
standard turbine types is practically completed. In order that
all ordinary combinations of speed and capacity may be covered
by these "standards," the company is building six different types
of radial inward-flow runners for Kt= 13 to about 80, and two
types of impulse-wheel buckets. Here only the high speed run-
ner, Type F, interests us. This type was designed to have at
least a type characeristic /Ct=68. The first runner of this type,
a 30-in. runner, was tested in the Holyoke testing flume after the
first publication of this article in the summer of 1909. The result
■of this test, although within the expectations of the engineers,
was far beyond the anticipations of the company. The following
•data obtained from the test are interesting.
At best efficiency, 82.5%, the turbine developed power at the
rate H-P1= 2.28 with a speed Ar1= 52. Thus the values of the
runner constants are:
Allis-Chalmers "Type F."
Kn= 3.89
Kr = 6.8
Kt = 7».y
With increased speed, the efficiency went down very slowly,
but the output was increased. At speed proportional to h\= 59,
the power was proportional to H-Px= 2.34. Thus
Kn= 3.80
Kr= 7.72
Kt = go.4

University, New York: D. Van Nostrand Co. Cloth; &lt;-,l/2
x8J/2 in.; pp. 186. $2.00.
The scope of this work is indicated in the preface which
states that "it is designed to be an elementary text book for stu-
dents in the engineering courses in colleges and universities
where the time allotted to the subject does not exceed three or
four recitations per week for one-half year and where the course
is preceded by college courses in mathematics, through integral
calculus, mechanics and physics." The eight chapters of the book
take up: a bar under direct stress, pipes and riveted joints, mo-
ments and shears in beams, torsion, the elastic curve, columns,
combined stresses, and beams of two materials, though some of
the subjects are treated but lightly. Each chapter is followed by
a series of examination questions and of problems.
To quote the preface again, "the notation has been made uni-
form with that of Merriman's works so that his more complete
treatise on the subject may be conveniently used as a reference
book." Not only is the notation the same in both books but the
method of treatment and the general arrangement are very sim-
ilar in the two. Such being the case, why shouldn't the student
study Professor Merriman's fuller treatise, omitting the more ad-
vanced portions rather than Professor Houghton's elementary
text? To be sure the former costs two and a half times as much
as the latter, but then, it contains four times as much material.

EDITORIALS.
For the first time in its history, The Technic appears as a
quarterly. The issue is later than it should be, but material was
slow in coming in and it was found impossible to get the copy
out before the usual time for the appearance of the first num-
ber. The rate for new subscriptions is $2.00 for the four num-
bers.
The fourth issue this year will be a handbook of Modern
Practice in Illuminating Engineering. This number is now in
the course of preparation under the direction of Professor Hig-
bie, and will consist of the results of tests now being carried on
in the photometry laboratory, and of papers by practical men en-
gaged in illuminating work. The regular price will be charged
for this number in the paper cover but quotations will be given
upon application for cloth or leather binding.
The Technic Board feels that no apology is necessary for
the re-publication of "The Design of American High Speed Run-
ners for Water Turbines." Every copy of the original is sold
and the demand is still active. A recent article by Professor
Zovvski which is a continuation of the first, appeared in the En-
gineering News, Vol. 63, No. 1, page 20. These are parts of a
text book which will appear in a few years, but until it does ap-
pear, these articles are being used by the classes as text books.
On this acocunt it has been thought advisable to re-print the first
article and have some extra prints struck off. The Engineering
News article is also being re-printed on Technic paper and the
two articles may. be obtained, bound together in pamphlet form
from the Business Manager of The Technic. A third article
in this series will appear soon in the Engineering News and if
possible this also will 1 e re-printed on Technic paper so that in
a few months the three articles may be obtained together.


We desire to express our thanks to the publishers of Engi-
neering News for their courtesy in loaning the cuts for the re-
prints of Professor Zowski's second article.
Now that The Technic is started as a quarterly, it needs,
more than ever before, the support and assistance of the alumni.
We are looking for contributions which will aid in keeping the
publication of interest to the graduate and active members of the
Engineering Society. If any alumnus knows of good material
for us we hope he will help us by telling about it, so that we may
keep The Technic up to a standard worthy of the Department.
We again call to your attention the fact that The Technic
is supported by its advertising and we ask our readers to favor
the firms that help us. It takes but little effort to mention The
Technic when you write to our advertisers, and it helps a great
deal in securing funds with which to publish.

HENRY SMITH CARHART, LL.D.
Professor Emeritus of Physics.
By Geo. W. Patterson, Ph.D.
The Technic has assigned me the pleasant task of writing
a brief sketch of Professor Carhart and what he has done for
the University during the twenty-three years he has served it
as professor of physics and director of the physical laboratory.
I feel it fitting to acknowledge my great personal obligation to
him for the inspiration given me by him while under his imme-


diate guidance in the early years of the department of electrical
engineering and in later years since that department has come
to be independent of the department of physics. Recognizing,
however, that it is the debt of the whole University of which I
should write rather than that which all of his staff, past, or pres-
ent, would gladly own, I turn to the task assigned me.
Henry Smith Carhart was born at Coeyman, New York,
March 2J. 1844. His college course at Wesleyan University in
Middletown, Conn., was completed by him with the highest
honors in 18(19 when he was graduated B.A. as valedictorian of
his class. As an undergraduate he not only was at the head of
his class in scholarship but found the time to develop the social
side of his character. He was a member of the Psi Upsilon
fraternity and formed many enduring friendships with his col-
lege mates both within and without his fraternity. His election
to the Phi Beta Kappa society was an honor to his scholarship.
In 1872 Wesleyan University conferred on him the degree
of M. A., and in 1893 that of LL.D. in recognition of his
eminence as a physicist and teacher. lie spent the year 1871-2
at Yale and the summer of 1876 at Harvard in graduate study,
and the year 1881-2 he devoted to research work in the Univer-
sity of P&gt;erlin in the laboratory of Professor von Helmholtz who
was perhaps the most renowned physicist the world has ever
known. It was in this year that Dr. Carhart iirst became known
for his experimental work on voltaic cells, a subject in which
in later years he was to become a world authority. It must have
been most gratifying to von Helmholtz to have his former pupil
chosen as his colleague by the International Electrical Congress
of 1893 (Chicago) on the commission of three to formulate the
details of the standard Clark cell, not as a courtesy to the United
States as host of the congress, but as a recognition that Dr.
Carhart was the foremost authority on the subject on either side
of the Atlantic. It will be remembered that von Helmholtz's
death occurred before the commission could finish its work.
In 1872 Professor Carhart entered the faculty of North-
western University as professor of physics, where he built a
science laboratory and achieved such high reputation that Mich-
igan called him here in 1886 as professor of physics. His first
labor at Ann Arbor was to build a physical laboratory suited to


the work and the means of the University. All the details of
the building were worked out by him. It is interesting to note
that the building was the first on the campus to be built within
the appropriation made for its cost by the Board of Regents.
In fact there was a modest sum left available for equipment.
This incident laid the foundation for Dr. Carhart's reputation
for executive ability which he so justly enjoys. The years since
have seen the physics department gain in strength and fame and
its students increase in numbers and enthusiasm under his direc-
torship of the laboratory. At first the building housed the
department of hygiene also, but soon this department was re-
moved, and then later the large addition to the building was made
to care for the needs-of physics alone. Even in the early days
when Dr. Carhart was the whole physics faculty, the laboratory
made real contributions to physical science in the work which he
had inspired in his more advanced pupils, and as the department
faculty grew, interest in research combined with sound learning
remained the keynote of the laboratory.
In 1889 Professor Carhart thought the time ripe for the
introduction of a course in electrical engineering and the Board
of Regents authorized him to select an instructor to assist him in
his enlarged duties. The writer was chosen for this instructor-
ship and enjoyed the advantages of the close association result-
ing. The interest in physics in general and applied electricity
in particular grew steadily and with the increase in students and
work of the department the staff was gradually increased until
the work outgrew the physical laboratory. Soon after the separa-
tion of the engineering courses from the department of literature,
science and the arts, and the formation of the department of
engineering, the work in electrical engineering was removed to
the then recently completed new engineering building and the
union between physics and electrical engineering came to an end.
Thus it was that electrical engineering began and grew into a
fully developed department under the personal direction of Dr.
Carhart, and to him is due in large measure its present excellent
courses and standing in the engineering world.
Dr. Carhart has enjoyed a high reputation as an electrical
expert not only in the subject of voltaic cells, but in the field
of all sorts of electrical appliances; and he has figured as expert


in many suits involving the validity of patents of electrical
devices, and he has frequently been called in to advise with
respect to the instalation of electrical machinery and the lighting
of cities. The Campus lighting plant is of his design in all its
electrical details.
Since the separation of the departments he has devoted a
great part of his labors to the field of electrochemistry in which
so early he had made a name for himself. His leadership in this
branch of physical science has been recognized by the American
Electrochemical Society which has honored him and itself by
giving him important offices in its organization including its
presidency.
But it is not along the line of electrical science alone that
the physics department has achieved success; for side by side
with it Dr. Carhart developed other work, calling to his aid in
early years Dr. Reed who evolved from modest beginnings
courses of noteworthy excellence in sound and light, and has
now succeeded him as director of the laboratory. When Dr.
Carhart retired last fall as professor emeritus he left a depart-
ment fully organized and manned with an able department facul-
ty which has further been strengthened by the return of Dr.
Guthe after many years absence. The return of Dr. Guthe was
a cause of great rejoicing not only to Dr. Carhart and the physics
department but to the whole University.
Among the many evidences of the appreciation with which
the scientific world holds Professor Carhart, it may be noted, in
addition to the positions of honor earlier mentioned, that he was
a member of the international jury of awards at the Paris
exposition of 1881, president of the board of judges in' the
department of electricity at Chicago in 1893, a United States
delegate at the International Electrical Congress at Chicago in
1893, and at St. Louis in 1904, where he was vice-president, and
he was the sole delegate from the United States at the electrical
units conference at Berlin in 1905 and one of the three delegates
of the United States at the conference at London in 1908, the
other two being government officials from the Bureau of Stand-
ards. In these congresses and conferences Dr. Carhart took an
important part. Besides his published researches Professor Car-
hart's books on general physics and on primary cells have added


much to his reputation as a teacher and scholar, and his new
book on physics, shortly to appear, will add not a little to his
fame. On the occasion of his receiving a retiring allowance from
the Carnegie fund, its president, Dr. Pritchett, wrote President
Angell that the executive committee desired that Dr. Carhart
should be informed of the high estimate by the executive commit-
tee of his services as teacher and investigator.
Dr. Carhart is a member of many learned societies and here
in Ann Arbor he has done much outside his department to pro-
mote interest in what other men are doing in science. He was
one of the founders of the Research Club and an interested and
always interesting member of the less formal Scientific Club.
The debt of the University to Dr. Carhart is perhaps equally
founded on the executive ability shown in the development of his
own and her daughter department (electrical engineering) and
also his great success as a teacher of men. How seldom is it
that we find a man a great teacher and at the same time a pro-
ductive scholar of world wide fame! His pupils will always
remember his clearness as a lecturer and the uniform success of
his experiments; but more than this, they will always be con-
scious of the impress that as a man he made on them.
And then to us who have been fortunate in knowing him,
there is the indescribable charm of good fellowship and per-
sonality which we shall not lose while he is among us, though he
has laid his University duties down. May he live long to enjoy
his rest from University labors and to prosecute his researches
in old but ever new fields.


DESIGN OF RIVETED JOINTS FOR BOILERS.
By John Edward Emswiler, M.E., Instructor in Mechani-
cal Engineering.
A common means of securing a working equation is to write
an expression in the form necessary to satisfy the conditions of
the case, and then insert in this expression constants derived from
experimental data or practical experience. Such a course may
be followed in obtaining working expressions for the design of
fluid tight riveted joints.
The variables involved are pitch, diameter of rivets, and thick-
ness of plate.
The following notation will be used:
p = longest pitch (See Figs, i and 2).
/&gt;' = short pitch (See Fig. 2).
d = diameter of rivet hole (= diameter of rivet + 1/16").
t = thickness of plate.
/i = ultimate strength of plate in tension.
/» = ultimate strength of rivets in single shear.
/•«= ultimate strength of rivets in double shear.
/c= ultimate strength of plate or rivet in crushing.
The thing that limits the pitch in a fluid-tight joint, is the
staunchness of the joint. There can not be a very wide range of
pitch for this reason. In fact, an examination of practical joints
shows that the distance between the edges of adjacent rivet holes
is practically constant for any given type of joint. With this dis-
tance constant, the strength of plate in tension, between rivet
holes, increases directly as t. The size of rivet, to continue equal
in strength to the strip of plate, must increase as d1. Hence, d2
varies as t, or
d* = Kt (1)
K is to be determined by an inspection of actual successful joints.
The strength of the strip of plate between rivet holes, for a
width p along the joint, may be written thus:


The strength in shear, of all the rivets contained in the width
f, may be written
■kcP ,
« — fs
4
where « = number of rivets in the width /&gt;.
Then, in order that the joint may be equally strong against
tearing the plate between rivets, and shearing off all the rivets
(p-d)tft=n *-f-ft

(p -d)t= — £- d* = A" d*
4 A
p = — \-d
K1 is to be obtained as was K in equation (i).
The values of K and K', for double, triple, and quadruple
riveted joints, were obtained by a study of the joints recom-
mended by the Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection and Insurance
Co., and, inserted in equations (i) and (2), give the following
working expressions:
a. Double Riveted Lap Joint:
d2 = 2.2.s / d= 1.5 \'t

b. Triple Riveted Lap Joint:

(2) Plates above 7/16" thick.

■ I. Quadruple Riveted Butt Joints:
(i) Plates up to and including 9/16" thick.
a" =1.66/ d = i.2gVt
p' = 1.72 — + d = 2.86 + d
(2) Plates above 19/32" thick.
d2—1.941 d=i.3g\?t
P' = r-39 — + d — 2.70 + d
e. Single Riveted Joints:
The above rules, or forms of expressions do not seem to ap-
ply fully to single riveted joints. In boilers, single riveted joints
are used only for girth seams, and in such seams, the diameter
of the rivet is conveniently the same as that of the rivets in the
longitudinal seam. At least, this diameter may be used as a trial,
and if it is found that the joint requires a larger rivet to be suffi-
ciently strong in shear, a rivet large enough to satisfy this last
condition can be used.
When the longitudinal seam of a boiler is a lap joint, the
pitch of rivets in the girth seam may be ?4 of the pitch of rivets
in the longitudinal seam.
When the longitudinal seam is a butt joint, the girth seam
pitch may be 2/3 of the pitch of rivets in the longitudinal seam.
For designing single riveted joints independently of other
joints, the following rule from Kent may be used for determin-
ing d.
d = 2.33 t
The pitch is determined by the same rule as was used in other
joints:
P=^ + d
Use
K'=.56
Then
P = -&amp;^-+d
The foregoing equations make it possible to design a joint,
after t has been determined, t cannot be determined directly, but


must first be approximated. The bursting load on an inch length
of shell is PD, where P is the steam pressure in pounds per sq.
in., and D is the diameter of shell in inches. To resist the load,
the thickness of shell must be
r
Pi)
* A
X F
where F is the factor of safety.
Since the plate is weakened by the perforations for rivet holes,
/' must be increased arbitrarily to some value t, which can be
used as a trial quantity in determining d and p, in the equations
above.

Take a joint such as is shown in Fig. i, or Fig. 2. Consider
a strip of width /&gt; in each case. Since the whole joint consists of
a series of strips of this width, in every one of which, the num-
ber of rivets and their arrangement is like that in every other
such strip, whatever calculation may be made for one strip, will
also hold good for the entire joint.
A joint may fail in one of several ways, the manner, and ex-
pression for strength of which, may be written as follows. For
clearness, consider each figure separately.
For Fig. 1:
1. Ultimate strength resisting tearing on first row of rivets
(plate .1" on bb, and plate y on aa),
St=(p-d)tf,
Plate x cannot, of course, tear on aa, nor y on bb, because each,
in so doing would not only have to rupture as much plate in ten-
sion as in tearing on the first row, but would also have to shear
or crush at the rivet in the outer row.
2. Ultimate strength resisting shearing off of 2 rivets in sin-
gle shear:
S, = 2 —— /s
4
3. Ultimate strength resisting crushing of plate or rivet—
2 rivets.
The area subject to crushing is taken as the projected area of
the rivet in the plate.
For Fig. 2.
1. Ultimate strength resisting tearing on outer row e'e':
St=(p-d)tf,
2. Ultimate strength resisting shearing oft' of 5 rivets—4 in
double shear, and 1 in single shear:
it cP . . - d* ,
Ss = 4 —— /s» + —— /.
4 4
Tests indicate that a rivet is not quite twice as strong in dou-
ble shear, as in single shear. The customary way of figuring
rivets in double shear is to regard the rivet as having a single


area in shear, and apply the fiber stress given for double shear,
as is done in the above expression for S».
3. Ultimate strength resisting crushing—5 rivets:
5C = 5 d t fc
4. The joint may also tear on the line b'b', and shear off the
one rivet in the outer row:
St' = (p-2d)t/t + ^-f- ft
4
5. There may be tearing on the line b'b', and crushing at the
one rivet in the outer row:
St"= (p—2d) tfi+dtf*
Expressions similar to the above, can be written for any kind
of joint.
Dividing the least of these ultimate strengths by the factor
of safety, gives the working strength of the joint. This strength
must be as much or more than the load actually to be carried on
a strip of shell of width p, which is
y= PD*P
2
If, in designing a joint, it is found that the working strength is
very different from the actual load, a new trial value of t must
be assumed, and computations for d, and p, carried through again.
The ultimate strength of a plate p inches wide is
S = ptft
The efficiency of the joint then, is the ratio of the ultimate
strength of the joint, to the ultimate strength of the imperforated
plate, 1. c, Eff. = St/S or Sa/S or S9/S or St'/S or St"/S de-
pending upon which of the quantities in the numerator is the
smallest. In most cases St will be found to be the smallest.
The margin m (Figs. 1 and 2) is made \~y2 d, which insures
ample strength against the rivet breaking through the edge of the
plate.
Double butt straps are made 1/16" less in thickness than t.
The distance V (Figs. 1 and 2) is made .6 p', and the distance
O (Fig. 2) is made .75 to .9 p'. These values of V and 0 are
sufficient to prevent tearing of the plate on a zigzag line.


'flie following values for ultimate strengths of materials of
boiler joints are given in the Massachusetts Boiler Rules, and
also by the Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection and Insurance Co.
For Iron Plates /t = .15,000 lbs. per sq. in.
For Steel Plates ft = 55,000
For Iron Rivets (Single Shear) /» = 38,000
For Iron Rivets (Double Shear) f*»= 70,000
For Steel Rivets (Single Shear) f* =42,000
For Steel Rivets (Double Shear) /»»:= 78,000
For Steel Plates /c = 95,000
The usual factor of safety in boiler work is 5.


THE FLOW OF WATER OVER DAMS.
By Prof. Gardner S. Williams.
Two formulae are in common use in this country for com-
puting the flow of water over sharp edged weirs without end
contractions. The older one. known as the Francis formula, was
devised by Mr. James B. Francis in 1854. As usually written
this formula is,
a = ,33L(, i)-'
where Q = the discharge in cuhic feet per second.
L = the ength of weir in feet,
h = the observed head on weir in feet.
v = the mean velocity of water at the point where he head was
measured,
g = the acceleration due to gravity.
From a series of experiments performed in France between
1887 and 1898, Bazin deduced the following expression:
/ , o00984\ / . o.ss h2\
Q = (o 405 + —J*) ( 1 J £*_) L li V 2 Kh
where p = the height of weir above the channel in feet and the other
letters have same significance as before.
In the two sets of experiments from which these formulas
were deduced, slightly different methods of measuring the head
were used. In applying the formulas, in very accurate work, care
must be taken that the head is measured in a manner correspond-
ing to the formula which is to be used. If this precaution be
observed and the weirs are carefully constructed, with sharp
edges and level crests, the results from the two formulas will
accord with each other and with volumetric measurements within
one or two per cent.
While the sharp edged weir is thus such an admirable instru-
ment for stream gaging, the expense of constructing such a weir
is very considerable. As power or storage dams are found on
nearly all streams in the settled part of the country, it is evident
that a modification of these formulas, which would allow them
to be applied to a dam of the ordinary type, would be of great
value to every one engaged in hydraulic work. Until recently,


little was known of the manner in which the cross-section of a
weir affected the discharge over it. Hydraulic engineers were
accustomed to assume that the flow over any dam was the same
as that over a sharp edged weir of the same length under the
same head; a procedure which is now known to introduce errors
of from one to twenty per cent. Although Francis had pointed
out about i860 that the discharge of a weir was decreased by
replacing a sharp edge with a broad, flat top, no satisfactory
investigations were made of the matter until about fifteen years
ago. Since then, two important series of experiments on this
subject have been performed.
In 1898, M. Henri Bazin published in "Annales des Ponts et
Chaussees" several sets of such experiments. He used the
formula Q=mLh, and determined the value of m, for a large
number of different dams under heads varying from 0.3 to 1.3
feet. Portions of P&gt;azin's reports'have been presented to different
scientific societies in this country, but the work, as a whole, has
not been translated in the English language.
At the Hydraulic Laboratory of Cornell University, there was
performed by the writer a series of weir experiments, begun in
1898 for the United States Board of Engineers on Deep Water-
ways, and afterward continued independently and with the aid
of the United States Geological Survey for a number of years.
The discharge over various dams was compared with that over
a sharp edged weir of the same length, and of the same height,
and thus factors, or multipliers were obtained by means of which
the discharges of either the Francis or Bazin formula can be
reduced to those of ordinary dams. A sufficient quantity of
water was available in the experimental canal, to permit the
observations bc'ng carried to heads of four feet over weirs six-
teen feet in length.
The tables accompanying this article contain the factors
found for fourteen dams of common forms, under heads varying
from 0.5 to 4.0 feet. To find the discharge over a dam, first com-
pute, by either the Francis or Bazin formula, the discharge over
a sharp edged weir of the same length, and height, and under the
same head. Then multiply this discharge by the factor given in
the table for the given type of dam and the given head. This
gives the discharge over the dam under the given conditions, with


an accuracy nearly as great as that of the discharge computed for
the sharp edged weir.
The simplest form for the cross-section of a dam is a rectan-
gle, as in Figure i. When water flows over, there is a vertical
contraction beginning at A, the same as in a sharp edged weir,
but the water meets the crest again at E. The sudden change of
direction at E and the friction on the surface E B both cause a
loss of head and tend, therefore, to diminish the discharge;
hence, the discharge under these conditions is always less than
that of a sharp edged weir and the factor less than unity. As h
increases, the amount of vertical contraction and the distance A E
increase, and the distance E B, in which loss of head due to
friction takes place, diminishes; The discharge relatively to a
sharp edged weir consequently increases, Therefore, the factors
increase as // increases until the sheet jumps clear of the crest and
the condition is that of a sharp* edged weir. With the 0.48 foot
crest, the points E and B coincide when li is a little less than 1.5
feet, and at heads of 1.5 feet, or greater, the sheet of water leaps
clear of the dam. That is, for heads above 1.5 feet, the 0.48 foot
dam discharges exactly like a sharp edged weir, and the discharge
should be computed as such. In the 0.93 foot dam, the same
thing occurs at /i = 2.5. With the 1.65 crest, the factor continu-
ally increases and, while it appears that the dam would act as a
sharp edged weir if the head were made great enough, that point
was not reached in the experiments.
As the head increases, the velocity across the crest increases
and, in the region E B, the friction per foot increases. In the
wider dams, a point is thus reached where the increase in friction
due to the greater velocity exceeds the decrease in friction due
to the diminishing of the distance E B. Hence, from this point,
the factor begins to decrease once more. In the dams more than
three feet wide, this point occurs when the head is about 1.5 feet.
In all the dams of this type, the factors decrease as the
breadth of the crest increases, since the length E B, over which
friction acts, is increased. The height p, of the dam above the
bottom of the channel, has no effect on the discharge relatively
to the sharp edge, provided it is great enough to insure complete
vertical contraction.
As the vertical contraction existing in the case of the sharp


17
|-.q I
Fig. 2


edged weir, is due to the fact that part of the water approaches
the crest from beneath, that is, moves nearly vertically upward
along the up-stream face of the dam, it follows, that if the up-
stream face of the dam is inclined, this contraction will be dimin-
ished and the discharge correspondingly increased. Table II
gives the factors for two such dams of the type shown in
Figure 2. Since these dams give a greater discharge than a sharp
edged weir, the factor is always greater than unity. It increases
slightly with the head, at first, and then, after the head has be-
come as great as 1.5 or 2.0 feet, it gradually diminishes. This
subsequent decrease is due, partly to the fact that, as the head
increases, the form is of less importance in determining the dis-
charge. This may be better understood by considering the effect
of an infinite head, in which case the discharge will evidently be
entirely independent of the shape of the dam. At low heads, the
height p has little influence on the factor, but as the head in-
creases the slope of the smaller dam is not long enough to give
its full effect in diminishing the vertical contraction. Therefore,
under high heads, the factor is less for the .low triangular dam
than for the high one.
Turning again to Figure 2, it is easily seen that, if the dam
were built out to just touch the curve A FE, the discharge wou!j
be but slightly affected, while the head would be diminished by
the difference in elevation of the points A-and F. By thus round-
ing the crest, the factor will be increased. Acting on this princi-
ple, a dam "Type L,", of the shape shown in Figure 3, was built
and the factors given in Table II determined. At heads below
that for which the curve was designed, the values of the factors
are low due to the friction on the underside of the sheet, but for
the larger heads they are higher than the values for the corre-
sponding triangular dam.
The three types, I, J, and K, were used to show the effect of
the up-stream slope on the discharge. They all have the same
crest, very similar to that of type L, but the up-stream slope
varies from one on four to one on one. The factors are given in
Table III. They vary with the head in much the same manner
as the factors for type L. Under high heads, the discharge over
type I is a little less than over type L, but J and K are always

To find the discharge over a dam; compute the discharge over a sharp edged weir of same
length and height, and under same head; and multiply this discharge by the factor given in the
table for the dam and head in question.


more efficient than L; and of these two, K gives the greater
discharge.
These tables cover, in a general way, the most common cross-
sections of power and storage dams, and by their aid these dams
are made available for measuring the flow of streams.
There is also another valuable use to which these data may be
applied. At many water power plants the'quantity of water used
is fixed by the flow of the stream at low water; while the head is
limited by the fact that in time of flood all the water must be
discharged over the dam, without submerging the lands above.
By the use of these tables, it is frequently possible to select a
form of dam, capable of discharging all the flood water under
less head than is required by the dam previously in use.
The new dam may be higher than the old, by the difference
in the heads required by the two different forms in time of flood.
This increase of head will give an increased output of power
under ordinary conditions of flow. In this way, a very moderate
expenditure may be sufficient to permanently increase the ca-
pacity of the plant.
Further treatment of this subject will be found in Williams &amp;
Hazen's "Hydraulic Tables", the volumes of "Annales des Fonts
et Chaussees" from 1888 to 1898, and the "Transactions of the
American Society of Civil Engineers," Vol. 44.


DEFLECTION OF BEAMS.
A. E. Greene, Junior Professor of Civil Engineering.
The form assumed by a beam when bent under its loads may
be determined by analyzing its bending moment diagram much
more readily than by deriving the equation of its elastic curv.
The latter method, which is given in all text books on Strength
of Materials, is very laborious in all but the simplest problems,
while the semi-grafical methods described below are readily ap-
plied to beams under any condition of loading. The treatment
by area-moments in particular is so flexible and affords such an
easy solution of the unknown moments in restrained and continu-
ous beams that it deserves a much more extended use that it en-
joys at present. That method of analysis was discovered by
Professor Charles E. Greene in 1873 since which time it has been
taught to the engineering students at the Universitly of Michigan.
AREA MOMENTS.
Fig. 1 shows a portion of a beam between two right sections
AB and CD, which were parallel and a distance 8s apart before
the beam was bent by a moment M. The fiber EF, distant y
from the neutral surface, has increased in length from 8s = p8&lt;p
to (p-\-\) 8&lt;f&gt; or has been stretch \8&lt;j&gt;. Its unit strain accordingly is
y8&lt;f&gt;/8s which accompanies a unit stress of p = Ey -' accord-
ing to Hooke's law. Equating this with p from the equation of
the resisting moment, /&gt; = —-■ , at the limit
M
By means of this equation we can study the form assumed
by a beam bent by external forces into an elastic curv such as
A B of Fig. 2. The bending moments at the various sections
caused by the external forces (not shown) are given by the
ordinates to the iU-diagram, A'B'. In practicable beams the
curvature is small and ds of the equation may be replaced by dx.
Then the angle between tangents drawn at any two points A and


THE MICHIGAN TF.CHNIC
B of the elastic curv is, since the angle between the tangents is
the same as between the radii,
J A £/Ja
if / is constant.
The right hand member of this equation is the area of the
M- diagram between the ordinates A' and B' and if this area
Fig. 1
Fic.Z
is computed and then divided by EI, the result is the angle &lt;f&gt; in
radians. With ^1/ exprest in inch-pounds the area is inches2X
pounds; E is pounds/inches2 and / is inches1 so that El is also
inches2Xpounds and the quotient ^ is a ratio.
To find the displacement of a point B on the elastic curv
from a tangent at A imagine that the portion AB, when in an
unstrest condition, had the position ABt and that the point Bt has
been bent around to B thru a distance A. When the curvature
of the beam is small, as it must always be in practicable beams,
the path of B deviates but little from a straight vertical line.
Any element 8.r bends thru an angle 8&lt;f&gt; which causes a displace-


ment of the point B a distance of 8A=.r8&lt;£ and the total displace-
ment for a beam of constant cross-section is
Kxd*=Ei) KMdx ■*-?**$ KMdx
in which ~ is the distance from the centroid of the M- diagram
A'B' to the ordinate B' by definition of centroid. Therefore to
find the displacement A of the point B from a tangent at A com-
pute the area of the M— diagram and multiply it by the distance
from its centroid to the ordinate under B. This product of the
area by its arm is called the area-moment and when divided by
EI is the distance A.
Tangents to the elastic curv at any two points A and B inter-
sect over the centroid of the M- diagram between the ordinates
under the points. For, let the distance from the intersection to B
be r; then A=&lt;£r. But

Area moments do not give the deflections of a supported
beam from its original position directly, but the deflections are
found by selecting a tangent from which displacements A are
measured and from these displacements the deflections from the
original position are obtained as will be shown in the following
examples.

It is interesting to note that as a varies from o to l/2l, x ranges
from 0.577/ to 0.5/ or the point of maximum deflection always
lies within the middle 0.16 of the beam. The amount of the
deflection is readily found by taking area moments about the

If in any given problem the load is placed in the right half of
the span, measure a from the right end and x from the left.
The problem of finding the maximum deflection might have
been solved by finding the ordinate which would divide the M—
diagram into two parts such that the area moment of the left part
about the left end should equal the area moment of the right part
about the right end. The ordinate under D evidently satisfies this
condition since the displacement of each end of the beam from
the tangent at D is the same.

This is Euler's formula approximately. A disappears from the

diagram had been treated as such, ir2=9.87 would have been ob-
tained instead of 9.6.

RESTRAINED BEAMS.
To draw the il/-diagram of a beam fixt at the ends imagine
that the beam rests on knife edges at the wall where it is kept


27
horizontal by loads applied beyond the supports as in Fig 9. If
an M—diagram is drawn for the beam carrying only the loads
between the supports and another for the beam carrying only the
loads outside the supports, the actual bending moment at any
section of the beam is given by adding the corresponding ordi-
nates of the two diagrams. Now
the first diagram is that of a
beam supported at the ends and
the moments are positiv, while
the second diagram consists of a
straight line across the span and
ordinates to it are negativ. The
combination of these two dia-
grams gives the Jlf-diagram for
a beam fixt at the ends and the
diagram is drawn just as for a
simple beam under the same
loading but with a closing line
located to give negativ moments
at the fixt ends. The values of
these negativ moments can be
found readily by the use of
p,Q g area-moments. It is more con-
venient to use the areas of the
positiv and negativ diagrams separately than the area of the
combined diagram.
7. Beam fixt at both ends, uniform load of w per unit of
length. Fig. 10. Since the beam is horizontal at both ends, the
angle between tangents drawn at these two points is zero and the
total area of the il/-diagram must be zero or the negative area
must equal the positiv. The area of the parabola is two-thirds
that of the enclosing rectangle, hence the closing line is drawn
2/3.1/8zc/'- above the base of the parabola.

9. Beam fixt at both ends, single load. Fig. 12. Since the

trapezoid, whence

Also the displacement of either end from a tangent at the other
end is zero or the area moment about either end is zero. Dividing
the trapezoid into two triangles and taking moments about the
left end gives
(1/2^06)2/3(0 + l/2b) +1/2MJ) 1/3/ + (l/2A/a/)2/3/ = 0.

has the same form, M corresponding to re and EI to H.
Hence if the il/-diagram of a given beam is hung on a cord as a

distributed load and the cord is given a horizontal tension equal
to EI of the beam, the cord will assume the form of the elastic
curv of the beam. Therefore, to construct the elastic curv of
any loaded beam, draw the M-diagram and divide it up by equi-

distant vertical lines. Treat these divisions as loads, lay off a
load line and the pole distance EI and draw the string polygon.
This polygon will circumscribe the elastic curv of the beam. To
exaggerate the vertical deflections n times, that the curv may be
studied, the pole distance EI is to be divided by n. If the beam
is of variable section, the ^///-diagram is to be used as the load
and E or E/n as the pole distance.
12. Draw the elastic curv of a 2X12 in. plank laid flatwise
on supports 16 ft. apart and loaded with 50 lb./ft. over half its
length. Fig. 16. Draw the il/-diagram and divide the span into
8 parts of 2 ft. each. As the numbers to be used are large it will
be more convenient to use the foot than the inch as a unit.
Compute the areas of the segments, treat them as loads on a
16 ft. span and lay off a load line; thus the four loads of the
right half-span are ]/2 . 800.8 = 3200 lb. ft.2 = ab of load line.
If £=1^x10° lb./in.2, EI = 1 y2 . io'\ 1/12. 12.2'1 ~ 144 =
83333 lb. ft.2 To multiply the deflections of the beam by 20 lay
off H=4i67 lb. ft.2 and draw the string polygon. Then any
vertical ordinate of the latter measured to the scale of the span
is 20 times the deflection of the beam at a point over the ordinate.


HIE MICHIGAN TECH NIC
The maximum ordinate in the diagram of Fig. 16 is 5.35 It.
which shows that the maximum deflection of the plank is 0.27 ft.
THE ELASTIC CURV AS AN INFLUENCE LINE.
Maxwell's theorem states that if a load IV, applied at a point
A of a beam, causes a certain deflection at B, then will W applied
at B cause the same deflection at A. Fig. 17 shows the deflec-
tions of the beam with the load in each position. Suppose IV is
placed at A and that after the beam has deflected the other IV is
applied at B with the result that the deflection at A is na -f~ "b
and at B is %\ -\- vb. The work done upon the beam is
\/2.W\U + l/2ji7i&lt;b+ IF lib-
it W were first applied at B and afterwards IV were applied at A
the work would be
l/2lVvb + l/lWu. + IVV..
Fig.17
But the work done upon the beam must be the same regardless
of which load is applied first, hence t'a = «b as the theorem
states. From this relationship if follows that the ordinates of
the elastic curv of a beam with a load of unity at A shows the
varying deflection of the beam at A when a load of unity rolls
across the span; that is, the elastic curv is the influence line for
deflections at A. The above proof is perfectly general and
applies to a truss as well as to a beam of constant or variable
section.
The elastic curv can be used as an influence line for the
reactions of a beam or truss on three supports. Suppose the
middle support to be removed and that the elastic curv is drawn
for a load of unity at 2, as shown in Fig. 18. A load of W at C


33
with the beam supported at i and 3 would cause a deflection of
Wv at 2 while a force of. unity acting upward at 2 is sufficient
to raise 2 an amount equal to v2. Then to raise the po:nt 2 to a
level with 1 and 3 when W is at C would require a force at 2 of
P%= — W
But the only variable in this equation is v, hence the curv of v,
the elastic curv, is an influence line for P2, the reaction being
MC&lt;^W
Fig.20
found by multiplying the ordinate by the load and dividing by vt.
As W is multiplied by the ratio v/v2, it makes no difference
to what scale the elastic curv is drawn; it may be drawn for any
load at 2 instead of unit load as assumed.
To draw the influence line for Plt imagine the support 1
removed and an upward force applied at that point to the beam
supported at 2 and 3. If this force at 1 is equal to the reaction
which existed at 1 when the beam was supported at 1 and 3 and
loaded at 2, the elastic curv will have the same form as before
since the Af-diagram in each case has the same ordinates. There-

fore, on the curv of Fig. 18, which is reproduced in Fig. 19, draw
a base line E D, and ordinates between the curve and the base
line will give the deflections of the cantilever from its original
position. The value of the left reaction for a load at C is
Px = y/z\W by an analysis similar to that for P.,.

such as C maj' be drawn by modifying the influence line for

when the load is on the right or on the left of C. Fig. 20 shows
the plot of these equations. Such influence lines' may be con-
structed for analyzing the stresses in a swing bridge of two spans
by plotting the deflection of the bottom chord joints with the
truss supported at each end and loaded at the pivot. The deflec-
tion of the joints is readily obtained by means of a Williot
diagram.

A HISTORY OF THE SUMMER CAMP OF THE
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN.
By H. B. Merrick, '98.
During the last years of Professor DeVolson Wood's connec-
tion with the University of Michigan he conceived the idea of
providing the students of Civil Engineering with some means of
obtaining a personal knowledge of the actual conditions under
which surveying must be carried on. As early as 1870, work in
camp was planned by him as a part of the regular course, but it
could not then be arranged for. At that time there was some
talk of calling J. B. Davis from the survey he was then engaged
upon to take charge of the camp and the work tc5 be done in it.
In 1872 Professor Wood's connection with the university was
severed. J. B. Davis became Assistant Professor of Civil
Engineering the same year. During that, and the following
year, considerable time was spent in arranging the course and
getting the work in hand. Field work in camp was put in the
plan then formulated. The idea was to "spend four weeks in the
field at as large a variety as is practicable of the common duties
of an engineer on surveys."
In 1874 the first class to take up field work under actual
conditions became a reality. The class numbered twenty-one
and the work was done on the northeast side of Whitmore Lake.
As no camp outfit was available they boarded at the Clifton House
and were taken across the lake each morning in a small steamer.
It may be of interest to note here the names of the members
of this class. We find enrolled: A. L. Arcy, L. Baker, *C. C.
Baldwin, *H. D. Bates, *B. Birdsall, C. L. Buckingham, *F. G.
Bulkley, *C. Carnefix, R. C. Carpenter, L. L. Dickinson, *J. C.
Eaton, D. Fall, E. Grant, J. W. Hoover, W. E. Milburn, *J. H.
Morrison, M. L. Newton, *G. E. Pantlind, E. T. Parsons, W. H.
Potter, E. D. Root, W. S. Russell, M. J. Wells, G. Lilley.
In 1875, the class, consisting of twelve persons, worked in
Barry Co. on Thornapple Lake. This lake is simply an enlarge-
*Dead.


ment of Thornapple River. The stopping place was at a tavern
kept by a man named Vole and was on the south side of the lake
in the township of Hastings.
The class was at work May 25th and spent four weeks in the
field.
The next year Professor Davis was absent at the Centennial
and the field work was done in and around Ann Arbor under the
direction of Professor Charles E. Greene.
In 1877 it became possible to purchase some tents, and the
class numbering seventeen, went into camp near the center of
Sec. 19, T. 26 N., R. 3 W. This is about two miles south of
Grayling( and was the site of an old camp occupied by Professor
Davis when locating the Jackson, Lansing and Saginaw Railroad
(Northern Extension). This is now a part of the Mackinaw
D'vision of the Michigan Central Railroad.
One large circular tent and two 9'-4" square tents were used.
A camp kitchen was maintained, but this was the only time for
a number of years.
The camp in 1878 was on the village green of Unadilla, Mich-
igan. Part of the class were in tents and some roomed in houses
facing the camp. All boarded at the hotel. An office tent was
used this year for the first time. All sleeping tents had stoves
in them from the first. Floors were put in some of the tents at
this place.
The number of students was the same as in 1877.
The camp of 1879 was at Clear Lake, about a mile southwest-
erly from Waterloo, Jackson Co., Michigan. The class list for
that year is incomplete. Six or eight students were enrolled.
In 1880 the class, at the request of Regent S. S. Walker, went
to Maple Rapids, Michigan. The object was to ascertain if the
water could be lowered on the large marsh and swamp above the
village, as a sanitary measure. The weather interfered with the
work to a considerable extent. Sixteen of the first eighteen days
were cither partly or entirely stormy. Some damage was done
to the tents by the high winds.
The students in this class numbered eight.
Camp was located in 1881 at Appleton*s Lake, about three
and one-half miles southwesterly from Brighton, Livingston Co.,
Michigan. Here a class of thirteen students boarded with Mr.
Appleton and a neighbor.


37
It was in this camp that Mr. J. W. Payne was drowned. Mr.
Payne was an old graduate and was subject to fits. While bath-
ing, preparatory to leaving camp, he fell on his face in shallaw
water and smothered.
In 1882 the camp was pitched for the first time in the northern
part of the southern peninsular of Michigan, and has never since
been in the southern part of the state. This year it was at Old
Mission, ( which is on a small bay on the east side of the penin-
sula which extends into Grand Traverse Bay. The sixteen stu-
dents boarded with Mr. Hedden.
Not caring to remain at Old Mission more than one year,
Professor Davis moved to Northport for his next location and the
class work was done there in 1883. The camp was on land be-
longing to Mr. Aldrich, and the class boarded at his house.
In 1884 the camp was on Clam Lake, Antrim Co., Michigan,
and in 1885. at Frankfort, now the northern terminus of the Ann
Arbor Railroad.
In 1886 the camp was set up in a grove on the outskirts of
the village of Leland, at the outlet of Carp Lake (now called
Lake Leelanau), in Leelanau Co., Michigan. The camp was main-
tained at this place each summer for nine years. Board was
obtained in the village.
Here the character of the work was broadened somewhat and
more extensive surveys were made. Base lines were laid out and
measured, a small triangulation system was laid out, and surveys
were made and estimates prepared for three ship canal cuts
joining Carp Lake with Lake Michigan.
In 1895, the camp was moved up the lake and set up near
Fountain Point Hotel. The classes worked two years at this
camp, extending the work begun at Leland.
In 1896, the work had progressed so far up the lake that it
was deemed advisable to make another move. Accordingly, in
1897, a new site was chosen and camp was set up in May on Sec.
12, T. 29 N., R. 12 W., on the east shore of the lake.
Here again, the experiment of having a kitchen and mess-
tent was tried. Mrs. Mary D. Handy of Howard City, Michigan,
did the cooking and meals were served in a tent adjoining the
cook-shanty. The board money was collected by Professor Davis
and turned over by him to Mrs. Handy.


In 1899 another move was made and camp was set up on
Sec. 36, T. 29 N., R. 12 W. Mrs. Handy again furnished the
board and has continued to do so up to the present time. The
same camp site was used three years.
The work having now progressed nearly to the upper end of
the lake, and the shores in this locality being very swampy, it was
decided to leave Carp Lake.
The site next season, after considerable search and considera-
tion, was just west of Burdickville on Glen Lake in Leelanau
Co., Michigan.
Glen Lake is one of the prettiest lakes in Michigan, and the
camp ground on the farm of Samuel Holden was the best one
around the lake.
The camp outfit, which by this time had assumed considerable
proportions, was brought by steamer across Carp Lake and up
the sluggish and winding Cedar Run to Cedar City, and thence
overland by wagon to Burdickville. This was done at the close
of camp work in 1901 and the goods were stored in a small
building erected on the camp ground for that purpose.
In 1902, the first year on Glen Lake, the work was done for
the first time during the summer vacation The work began on
the Monday following commencement and lasted six weeks in-
stead of four, as heretofore Professor Davis prepared camp and
started the work. Professor C. G. Wrentmore then took charge,
and for the remainder of that session and the next one (in 1903'j
the work was under his direction.
In 1904 the writer took charge of the camp work and has
continued in that capacity, always under the instructions, and the
wise conusel and guidance of Professor Davis.
The camp was located at Burdickville during the years 1902
to 1908. Since 1906, Mr. II. H. Atwell, Instructor in Surveying,
has been associated with the writer in the administration of the
class work in camp. In 1907 Mr. John Schmutz was added to the
staff, and in 1908 Mr. Hugh Brodie, both being members of the
regular teaching staff in Surveying.
As the classes grew larger (the highest number enrolled in
any one year being seventy-four and the work of looking after the
camp increased, the need of more help was felt. In consequence
of this, the number on the staff was increased until in 1909 it
consisted of H. B. Merrick, H. H. Atwell, J. Schmutz, H. Brodie,


39
I',. D. Rich, C. O. Carey and four assistants from the class grad-
uating in June of that year.
During the years the camp was situated at Glen Lake, the
idea that we needed a permanent camp ground which should be
the property of the Regents, was impressed more and more
strongly upon us. Indeed, for a long time that had been Pro-
fessor Davis' idea, and the matter had become the subject of
some discussion by the Regents. It is needless to say that Pro-
fessor Davis was untiring in his efforts to bring it to pass.
There was, of course, some talk of purchasing the property
upon which the camp stood at Burdickville, and prices were
obtained for the different properties in that vicinity. Nothing
came of it, however. Professor Davis had visited at various
times and was more or less familiar with other localities, such
as the Beaver Islands, Grand Island, Drummand's Island, the
North Manitou Island, the North Fox Island, the vicinity of
Traverse Lake, Torch Light Lake, Higgins Lake and the north
shore of Lake Huron between Les Cheneaux and Detour, with
a like result. Piatt Lake, Walloon Lake, Sable Lake and the
South Fox Island were thought of in this connection, but were
not visited.
In the summer of 1908 Regent Henry W. Carey obtained a
proposition from Colonel and Mrs. Charles Bogardus of Paxton,
111., regarding certain lands held by them in the vicinity of Pells-
ton, Michigan. As a result of negotiations following this, the
present camp ground became the property of the Regents.
Subsequent purchases have increased the area to 1666.1 acres
situated between Burt Lake and Douglas Lake in Cheboygan
County. By the terms of the agreement with Mr. and Mrs.
Bogardus the classes in surveying have the privilege of using
all lands belonging to the Bogardus Land and Lumber Co. for
the purposes of surveying. This adds many hundreds of acres to
our "range".
The camp site proper is on Lot 1, in the N.E. Fr. 34 of Sec.
33. T. 37 N., R. 3 W., on the south shore of South Fishtail Bay.
The property has a water front on Douglas Lake of two and
three-fourths miles and on Burt Lake of about three-fourths of
a mile.
In the summer of 1908, after the class had left camp at Bur-
dickville, the outfit was moved to the new site and stored in two


R\V\\\\M


big buildings which stood near the lake shore on Lot. 2 in Sec. 34.
A force was engaged at the same time in clearing the camp site
of brush and debris, building tent floors, kitchen, mess-tent, and
getting things in readiness for the classwork next year.
During the summer of 1909, while the class was in camp,
more clearing was done and the grounds put in better shape
generally.
In this camp, for the first time, we had a flag-pole. It was
69 feet in length and from its top "Old Glory" waved each day.
Other innovations in this camp were telephone connections,
free delivery of mail, a resident physician, and medical supplies.
Although the project as a whole is called the Bogardus
Engineering Camp, the students have decreed that the telephone
call shall be,—"Camp Davis".
The second drowning accident since the beginning of the camp
in 1874, occurred in Douglas Lake this year when Mr. R. A. P.
Barrier, of Detroit, lost his life on July 27th while bathing. He
entered the water alone after dark and was not seen alive again.
His body was recovered the next afternoon.
For the first time in the annals of the camp one of the regents
visited us this summer. The Hon. Henry W. Carey spent about
two hours and a half with us one day and seemed very much
interested in what he saw. We would be very glad if other
members of the board would follow his example.
When the property was acquired by the Regents the idea was
to have the departments of Biology, Forestry, and, perhaps,
others, organize field courses in their respective lines and camp
on these grounds for the work. The first to take advantage of
this opportunity were the Biologists who were present in the
summer of 1909. There is a wealth of material for their work,
especially for the botanists, as a large area in the southern part
of the property is a swamp covered with a dense and varied
growth of vegetation.

This, in brief, is the history of the Summer Camp as an
institution. It will be seen from the foregoing that the camp
has been in operation for thirty-six years, and that the Univer-

of instruction.


THE FOURTH DIMENSION.
By Professor Walter B. Ford.
In response to an invitation from the Editors of The Tech-
nic to present in an elementary way some of the ideas which
are commonly associated with the term "fourth dimension," I
take pleasure in submitting the brief account which follows. As
the subject is speculative rather than practical, my readers should
be prepared for certain vagaries of the imagination, sometimes
even ludicrous.
In the first place, what is the significance in a general sense
of the term fourth dimension? The question is perhaps most
naturally brought up at the close of one's course in plane and
solid analytic geometry. We are then familiar with the equations
of various curves (straight line, circle, conic sections) and of
certain surfaces (plane, sphere, ellipsoids, etc.). Let us take in
particular the equation of the circle and that of the sphere in
their simplest forms viz.; x2-\-y2==r1 and x2-\-y--\-z2=r2. These
two equations resemble each other very closely, the only differ-
ence lying in the fact that a third variable z, representing an addi-
tional coordinate or dimension, is needed in the case of the sphere.
This analogy soon leads one to push beyond the two equations
indicated and to ask the following question: what will the equa-
tion x2-)-y2-)-x:!-|-w2=r2 represent? Here we have four coordi-
nates or dimensions brought into play, and, in view of the fact
that solid analytic geometry teaches that three dimensions are
adequate to describe all points in space, we have thus encountered
something which (if it exists) cannot be interpreted as a plane
or solid figure. However, we are in any case at liberty
to regard it as a hypothetical locus, existent analytically from the
very fact that we have its equation, being non-existent only in
the visual, intuitive sense. If we agree to this we naturally call
the new locus a four dimensional sphere from the analogy of
its equation to the other two already mentioned, and, although
non interpretable, as we have said, in the ordinary geometrical
fashion of a plane or solid figure, it may now be shown to have a
number of geometrically interpretable properties. For example,


43
suppose it to be cut by the plane x=k. The points of intersection
of our new sphere and this plane will satisfy simultaneously the
equations x2+y2+z2-|-w2=:r2, x=k, and hence are such that
y2-J-z2+w2=r2—k2. Whence, the same intersection points con-
stitute an ordinary three dimensional sphere, since this last equa-
tion is that of such a sphere. We therefore reach the striking
conclusion that a four dimensional sphere is such that when cut
by a plane the intersection is an ordinary sphere. Or, in the
projective sense, we may say that just as an ordinary sphere when
projected upon a plane gives a circle (or two dimensional sphere)
so a four dimensional sphere when projected upon a plane gives
an ordinary three dimensional sphere.
What we have said thus far indicates how speculation regard-
ing the fourth dimension naturally arises from the standpoint of.
analytical geometry. It may, however, arise out of very simple
considerations in elementary geometry. Thus, let us suppose that
instead of living in a three dimensional world, our experience had
always been confined to one that was two dimensional, i. e. to the
plane instead of to space. We should then say that two equal tri-
angles ABC and A' B' C situated as follows:
could not be made to coincide. In fact, it is readily seen that no
motion which is confined to the plane itself permits of A' B' C
being superposed upon ABC notwithstanding the triangles are
equal. A person such as we are presupposing would thus class
the problem as impossible. However, if we allow ourselves the
freedom of a three dimensional world we may easily make A'B'C
coincide with ABC. To do so we have but to turn A'B'C
through space about C B' as an axis until it comes back into the
plane of A B C, after which a mere shift of A'B'C in the plane
will bring it into coincidence with A B C. The point to be noted
here is that a problem which appeared impossible to the two
dimensional person was so only because of his limited spatial


THE MICHIGAN TECHX1C
conception, not because it was impossible in itself. This thought
at once suggests the following analogy bearing upon the fourth
dimension. As three dimensional beings—i. e. with experiences
derived such as ours actually are—let us take two tetrahedrons
I and 2 which are equal in volume and similar, but which are
not similarly placed:
It takes but a moment's reflection to see that I cannot be made
to coincide with its equal 2 (regarded as a rigid solid) by any
motion in space. Whence, reasoning as before, we might now
say that this is merely the result of our limited notions of space
and that if 2 could be properly rotated through the fourth dimen-
sion and then returned to us, the problem would become possible.
Let us grant this thought and examine the change which such a
rotation would effect in 2. It is seen to be that of turning it
inside out, just as though a string hanging downward were
attached to the vertex and then pulled downward, keeping the
base fixed, until 2 again became a tetrahedron. The resulting
figure will be found to be superposable upon 1 by means of
motions in ordinary space. Looking at the problem from the
projective side, the rotation of 2 through the fourth dimension
is equivalent to taking its reflection in a plane mirror, since the
image thus obtained is readily seen to be superposable upon 1.
This latter interpretation is interestingly connected with the fact
that no person ever sees his two hands in the same aspect. Thus,
if lie looks at them when both palms are toward him the hands
are in different aspects because the fingers and thumbs are
arranged in relatively opposite orders—i. e. the thumbs point in


45
opposite directions and the fingers when arranged from left to
right occur in reverse orders in the two cases—and the sair.e is
true when the backs of both hands are held to view. Again, when
the palm of one hand and the back of the other are viewed
simultaneously the hands still appear in different aspects because
it is the palm of one and the back of the other that is being seen.
In line with what we have said, we may add that if we could
but rotate one of our hands through the fourth dimension we
could then see them in the same aspect. These remarks are like-
wise connected with the fact that by holding one hand before a
plane mirror and regarding its image in conjunction with the
other hand (unrcllectcd) we arc enabled to see them in the same
aspect. Lastly, it may be said that we never see ourselves in a
mirror as we really look, but rather as we would look after a
rotation through the fourth dimension. The image of ourselves
which wc actually see represents what we would become if the
front and back of the body were interchanged.
The conclusion to which we are led is that the fourth dimen-
sion may be fully as existent as any of the other three and, from
the side of analogy, it would seem to have reality. As creatures
bound to a three dimensional method of thinking, the spatial
conception of the fourth dimension is naturally foreign to us,
but it is reasonable to suppose that the difficulty is not so much
with the fourth dimension as with ourselves.
In closing, I may refer the reader to a number of books and
papers from which many interesting analogies lying beyond the
scope of the present article may be found. For this list I am
indebted in large part to Professor George D. Olds of Amherst
College.

A RATIONAL METHOD OF DETERMINING THE PRIN-
CIPLE DIMENSIONS OF WATER-TURBINE
RUNNERS.
F&gt;y S. J. Zowski, Assistant Professor of Mechanical
Engineering.
[Copyrighted, 1909, by S. J. Zowski.]
The principal dimensions of a water turbine runner are deter-
mined from the required speed and capacity and the available
head of water.
Let D = the mean runner diameter, in feet.
v = the corresponding peripheral speed, in feet per Second.
.V = the required rotative speed, in revolutions per minute.
then v = rDN/60 and D = 6or/»N (1 &gt;
so that when the proper peripheral speed to give good hydraulic
performance is known the diameter of the runner follows there-
from.
Let us assume that the runner is designed in such a way that
at its best speed the water discharges from the runner buckets
in planes going through the axis of rotation; this is a condition
which the turbine designer should always attempt to secure, in
order to avoid helical stream lines in the draft-tube. Then the
best peripheral speed is given by a simple formula. Denoting
the bucket angle by /?, the guide-vane angle by a, as in Fig. 1, and
the hydraulic efficiency by rn, the formula is:
- = l ^TR X ^L£ = K. X ,-n- (a)
where

several constant values of bucket angle /3 with varying values of

reasonable.

For simplicity we will assume that medium-speed runners
(/J = 90°) show a hydraulic efficiency of 84% (giving
Vehg = 5.198), and other types of runner an efficiency of 83%
(giving Vetlg = 5.167). These values are by no means taken
too high for runners of fair design and construction. Then the
speed constant has for the different types the following values:

where e» = hydraulic efficiency; 9 = gravity constant.
The desired peripheral speed of the wheel in feet per
second is
v = A\ \~H
where H = effective hydraulic head in feet.


For very high heads, which naturally will require low-speed
runners, it will be wise not to approach the minimum value of /8,
but to remain in the neighborhood of 90°, for the following
reason: The smaller the angle /9, or to be more exact, the
smaller the ratio fi/a, the smaller is the pressure-head under
which the water passes from the guide case into the runner
buckets. This reduced pressure will facilitate the separation of
the air that is contained in the water, and thus it will facilitate
honey-combing of the runner and guide case, so often observed
even in turbines otherwise most carefully designed and highly
finished.
Substituting the values of A"v in eq. (1) we obtain the follow-
ing simple formulas for the runner diameters:

As far as speed alone is concerned, any diameter within the
above wide limits could be used. The required capacity, however,
will limit the choice considerably. The following considerations
deal with the influence of capacity.
Let n = number of buckets.
n' = number of guide vanes.
t = thickness of bucket e(\ge.
t' = width of the eddy caused by the guide vane tips and
measured on the runner circumference (see Fig. 3).

every case as large a number of buckets as possible, the majority
put into a high-speed runner fewer buckets than into a low-speed
runner. The following empirical formulas, in which D is ex-
pressed in inches, will give satisfactory results.

Low-Speed « = 3.7 ]/ D
Medium-Speed n = 3.0 |/ D
High-Speed n = 2.2 j/ D
The number of guide-vanes is very often determined by the
simple rule that in every case a few more guide-vanes than buck-
ets should be put in (i. e., n'= 1.1 « to 1.3 n). This rule, how-
ever, gives low-speed runners too many guide-vanes, thereby
(on account of the small angles a which are used in low-speed
turbines) the gate openings become too small and correspondingly
the frictional surfaces become relatively large. Therefore it is
proper to take account of the guide-vane angle in choosing the
number of vanes. The following empirical formulas will give
good results. Again taking D in inches,

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Since for manufacturing reasons it is advisable that the num-
ber of guide-vanes be even, and possibly divisible by four, it will
be best to use an even number of buckets, in order to avoid hav-
ing more than one bucket edge coincide with a -guide-vane tip at
the same time. On this basis the curves in Fig. 4 have been
drawn. These may be used instead of eq. (9) and (10).

The eddies caused by the guide-vane tips should be reduced
to a minimum. The writer advises strongly to design the guide
case in such a way as to get point x (see Fig. 3) outside of the
runner circumference. This obviously must be obtained by shap-
ing the vane tips properly and by leaving a sufficient clearance
between vane and bucket tips. If this is done the entering
streams of water will join in a solid ring,.and the effect of the


eddies on the capacity of the runner will be nullified. The
constant K1 will then have the value.

For simplicity we shall assume that K1 has the uniform value
0.93 for all runner types and sizes, with the distinct understand-
ing however that in the final computation the exact value is to be
introduced, and also, if necessary, the item «' t' be considered.
The capacity of the turbine depends very directly on the
ratio B/D, or A'2. As a matter of fact it is this ratio which finally
determines the limits for the application of radial inward-flow
turbines. Turbine manufacturers are still struggling with the
problem of extending these limits in both directions; therefore
no definite maximum or minimum values can be given.
Present-day good practice indicates that until further advance
is made it is safe to fix the limits of breadth of runner at 1/30
and J/1 the diameter. The minimum value depends on the purity
of the water. The maximum value which could be allowed de-
pends on the design of the runner, for it is evident that the larger
the width of the runner, the more difficult it is to secure the
necessary passage area at the point where the water turns from


radial to axial direction. In the opinion of the writer it is pos-
sible to go somewhat above l/i with the ratio of width to diam-
eter, but then the runner must be bulged out sufficiently.
We have classified all runners under three types with refer-
ence to speed. It is customary to make a further classification;
with reference to capacity. Here also we distinguish three types.
The latter classification is based on the proportions of the runner
profile, or the ratios of (i) diameter at entrance point of buckets,
(2) diameter at exit point of bucket, (3) diameter of neck of
draft-tube. These diameters (Fig. 5) will be denoted by D, D',
and D". Their ratios depend mainly on the factor K2, or B/D.
Type I., or the low-capacity type, comprises all runners in
which the draft-tube diameter D" is less than the bucket exit
diameter D', or at most equal to it, and in which B/D lies be-
tween 1/30 and y%. Type II., the medium-capacity type, com-
prises runners in which D" is larger than D' but smaller than the
entrance diameter D, and in which B/D lies between % and %.
Type III., or the high-capacity type, comprises all runners in
which the draft-tube diameter D" exceeds the bucket entrance
diameter D, and in which B/D is between J4 and lA-
It is self-evident that high heads will require runners of both
low-capacity and low-speed type, while low heads will call for
high-capacity high-speed runners. In other words, small values
of Kr, naturally go with small values of Ky, and large values of
K2 go with large values of Kv. Mistakes in this respect are fre-
quently made by manufacturers of low-head turbines, when they
occasionally build a high-head turbine, by giving the runner buck-
ets of such turbines the same entrance angles (/3&gt;90°) as are
used on their low-head turbines. This increases the peripheral
speed so much that the runner diameter, and consequently the
size of the whole turbine, must be increased considerably in order
to obtain the required rotative speed.
A runner is characterized as to its capacity by the so-called
capacity constant,

The values of Kq for the different runner types can be found

By introducing these values in eq. (12) and solving for diameter
we obtain the following simple formulas:

Medium-speed medium-capacity
High-speed high-capacity

(0.67 to 0.40) y^ j
These formulas, together with eq. (5), will determine which
range of diameters can satisfy both the requirements as to speed
and capacity. Evidently only those diameters are suitable which
satisfy both eq. (5) and eq. (19).
The procedure can be further simplified by the use of a con-
stant which the writer has called Type Characteristic (see Eng.
News, Jan. 28, 1909). Its formula is:
At
N X V H-P 60 A\ X 1 A'q X V A'
where

For a turbine efficiency of 80%, K=i/ii, which may be
used as a fair average value for the present purpose. With this
figure, and the values of A',, and A"v, tabulated previously, we
obtain the following ranges for the Type Characteristic:

Low-speed low-capacity
Medium-speed medium-capacity
High-speed high-capacity
Type characteristic A't
12 to 28
23 to 44 } (21)
44 to. 87
With these formulas the determination of proper runner type
and diameter is very simple. We proceed as follows:
From the given values of horsepower output H-P, speed of
revolution N, and hydraulic head H, compute the type character-
istic A't by eq. (20). If the resulting figure is between 12 and 28,
a radial inward-flow turbine is possible, and the runners will have
to be of the low-speed, low-capacity type, with B/D = 1/30 to %,


59
/3 = 6o° to 900, and a profile which will fall between profiles
A and B of Fig. 5.
If the value of A't is between 28 and 44, the runner will have
to be of the medium-speed, medium-capacity type, with B/D =
}i to %, ^3 = 90", and a profile which will fall between profiles
B and C of Fig. 5.
If the value of A't is between 44 and 87, the runner will have
to be of the high-speed, high-capacity type, with B/D^= *4 to J.'j,
/J = 90° to 135°, and a profile which will fall between profiles
C and D of Fig. 5.
If the value of ATt is smaller than 12, and it does not seem
advisable to make B smaller than 1/30 of the diameter, a radial
inward-flow turbine is not possible, and an impulse wheel will
have to be used.
If the value of Kt is larger than 87, a multiplex turbine must
be built. That is to say, a case for which Kt is found to be, say,
174, which is 2 X 87, would require a quadruplex turbine of
which each runner is designed for Kt = 87.
Knowing the type of runner it is easy to find the other prin-
cipal dimensions, as now we can not make a mistake in the choice
of the rational values for the different constants in our equa-
tions. A few words must be added, however, in reference to the
draft-tube diameter D". The flow velocity c" at the point where
D" is measured, the "upper draft-tube area," is, in properly
designed runners, more or less the same as the flow velocity
in the discharge area of the runner. This velocity represents a
direct loss; but the loss is partly recovered by the conical lower
part of the draft-tube. In low-capacity runners there is no diffi-
culty in reducing the discharge loss to a minimum in the runner
itself. In high capacity runners, on the other hand, larger dis-
charge losses must be allowed, as otherwise the runner would
have to be bulged out too much. Expressing the discharge loss
measured at the upper draft-tube area in parts of the total head,
the following values will represent good practice.

Numerical Examples.—The following specimen calculations
will illustrate the application of the method set forth in this
article:
I.—Given H = ioo ft.; H-P = 2500 HP.; N = 250 r. p. m.
11 X 2S°o
Assuming 80% efficiency, Q = = 275 cu. ft. per sec.
From eq. (20),
250 X V 2500
A't = =^- = 39-55
100 jVioo
Comparing this with the sets of values given by eq. (21) we see
that the runner has to be of the medium-speed, medium-capacity
type, with bucket angle /3 = 90°. Therefore, from eq. (5),
D=&amp;X Vh = ^ X V ^o = 3.96yz.
Take D = 4 ft. The number of buckets is 21, from the chart
Fig. 4. The thickness of bucket edge, using cast buckets, is J^-in.
The number of guide-vanes (from Fig. 4) is 20, but the guide
case shall be designed in such a way that f = o giving for the
free circumferance -k D — m r = -a- X 48 —21 X J4 = 145-55 'ns-
= 12.16 ft.
The type characteristic, 39.55, is nearer the upper limit for
type 11 than the lower limit; assume, therefore, B = % D =
1 ft., and D" = D =4 ft. Then the free entrance area 1 X 12.16
= 12 :i6 sq. ft. Consequently,
ct = —^-r- = —-^— = 22.62/?. per sec.
12.16 12.16 r
For /3 = 90°, cT = c= Ve*gH. tana. Hence, assuming
fr 22.62
&lt;?h = 0.84, (an a -^ -= ——^ = &lt;M35
\/ehgU. 5198
whence a = 230 30'.
The upper draft-tube area, if the shaft does not extend into
the draft-tube, is J4 * X 42 = 12.57 SQ- ft- Consequently the
discharge velocity is
c" = 275 = 21.86//. per sec.
12.57
and the discharge loss percentage is


fO* 22.86s
2gH 64.32 X 100
0.0743
which value is satisfactory, according to eq. (22).
II.—Given H=t,6 ft.; H-P = 4,000 HP.; iV = 200 r.p. m.,
so that Q— 1,222 cu. ft. per sec. It is required that the turbine
be capable of sustaining 15% overload.
The type characteristic is
At =aoo&lt;X_L/"&lt;°°5= 143.5
36 V 36
Comparing with eq. (21) we find that we must use a quadruplex
turbine, with runners designed for
Jrt==iflis=71.8
2
This requires Type III, and consequently, by eq. (5),
/,=22Jo_i34Xi/-.
Since the value of Kt is nearer the maximum than the minimum
for Type III, take
_ 12SX V~H 12.S X j/36 „, ,. ', .
D = -p = — = 3.75 ft. = 45 tns.
Then the speed constant is
■* D N tX 3.75 X 200
K" = Z. ,-rr = —Z.—=? = -54S
60 y/H 60 v/ 36
Assuming eh = 0.83, yTug is found to be 5.167 then,
-4==i.a6fc= HElMEK
Vehg \ Sin p cos a
From the curves in Fig. 2, we see that we could use /? = 135°
o = 31 ° ; or p = 1300, a = 350 30'. We choose the former com-
bination, because the turbine must be capable of carrying over-
load. For these angles the value of ""' X sin a
\ sin (/3 — a) cos a
is 0.475, from Fig. 6. Consequently the radial entrance velocity
cr = 0.475 X \/lhgW =0.475 X 5-167 X V36= 14706. The
number of buckets, from Fig. 4, is 15. The guide case being
designed so that V = o, the free circumference is


n t jt Y '/
T D :—r = t 45 —t °r- = 136.03 ins. = 11.333 7?-
«» jl *° sin 1350 * ° °°0 y
Hence, 11.335 X -6 X 14.706= 1222/4, whence B = 1.823 ft-
Taking B = 22 ins., the ratio of width to diameter is 22/45=
1/2.045, which value is satisfactory.
Take into consideration the runner nearest the generator and
assume that the shaft projecting from this runner into the draft-
tube is loyi ins. in diameter; then the upper draft-tube area in
square feet is
V 4 4/144
for D" taken in inches. Assuming an allowable draft-tube loss
of 0.14, we have
^—^-=0.14//, or c"= V 2ff X 0.14 X 36 = 18 ft. per sec.
the draft-tube velocity. Then the diameter of the draft-tube
must be found from
^ V 4 4 '144 4
or
■k D"% 1222 144 fl- X 10.5s
= X 1 = 2530.59 sq. ins.
4 4 18 4
whence D" = 56.8 ins. Using 57 ins. for round numbers, the
discharge loss is reduced to 0.138 H.
The guide case and the regulating device shall be designed so
that maximum gate-opening corresponds to the guide-vane angle
0 = 40°. Assuming for the present that eq. (14) for radial
entrance velocity is true up to the maximum gate opening we find
with the aid of the curves in Fig. 6 that max. rr = 0.618 y/euglf,
whereas at normal gate opening we found cT = 0.475 ^/ehgH.
If we further assume that the efficiency remains unchanged, the
discharge at maximum gate-opening 400 will evidently be
Gmox =-^7X0 = 1.3 0,
o.47s
or, in other words, the turbine is capable of 30% overload
theoretically. Practically the overload capacity will be somewhat
smaller, as the assumptions made are not correct. Formula (14)


is valid only for the "normal'' gate opening; i. e., that for which
the turbine was originally designed and at which the water dis-
charges from the runner buckets in planes going through
turbine axis. Further, the hydraulic efficiency always is smaller
when the gate opening is different from the "normal"' gate
opening.
This is not the place to go any further into the difficult ques-
tion of the variation of speed, discharge and efficiency with
varying gate opening. Suffice it to state that, judging from
actual tests we may expect in the case at hand that the required
overload, being only half of the overload as figured before, will
certainly be obtained, very likely before the gates are opened to
the full 40° angle
It is hoped that the above outlined method of computing
water turbine runners will be useful to many engineers and will
help to eliminate turbines of irrational types and proportions. It
goes without saying that the values of the different constants
indicated by the writer, must not be adhered to too closely, and
that the boundaries between the different types arc not sharp, but
may be changed more or less according to the designer's prefer-
ence. Thus it would not make much difference whether a runner
of A't = 43 were designed with D" = D, or with D" somewhat
larger than D.


THE CONSERVATION COURSE IN THE UNIVERSITY
MICHIGAN.
The Regents on Nov. 4, 1909, established a course of study in
the Department of Engineering leading to the degree, at the end
of six years, of Master of Conservation Engineering. This
action was in recognition of the widespread interest in the con-
servation of nature's resources which was given tangible form in
this country by the Conservation Congress called by President
Roosevelt as one of the final acts in his administration.
The conservation engineer must be educated along broad lines
and much time must be given in preparation for his great work.
Naturally, be finds part of his preparation in thf Department
of Literature, Science, and- the Arts, and another part in the
Department of Law, these two departments in cooperation with
the Department of Engineering furnishing most directly the
training needed for active work in the field. The course of study
in conservation engineering, has, therefore, been arranged from
courses now taught, or provided for, in the Departments of
Engineering, of Literature, Science, and the Arts, and of Law,
without requiring the services of additional instructors at the
present time.
In detail the course embodies, in addition to the cultural sub-
jects, mathematics, physics and chemistry, as prescribed for the
other six-year courses in engineering the following:
In Mineralogy and Lithology, field determination of minerals
and stones.
In Geology, elementary geology, historic geology, soil geology,
and economic geology.
In Biological Sciences, general biology, economic botany, eco-
nomic zoology, and general forestry.
In Astronomy, latitude, longitude and time.
In Drawing, machine sketching, descriptive geometry and ad-
vanced projections.
In Surveying, elementary surveying, plane table, camera, stadia,
and triangulation.


In Civil Engineering, structural mechanics, strength and resist-
ance of materials, hydraulics, municipal and sanitary engin-
eering, water supply and water power.
In Mechanical Engineering, mechanism, heat engines and thermo-
dynamics.
In Electrical Engineering, dynamo-electrics, generation and
transmission.
In Chemical Engineering, general metallurgy and mineral and
botanical technology.
In Political Economy, general principles of economics.
In Law, elementary law, contracts, constitutional law and con-
veyancing.
The course as recommended will then be as follows:
Cultural Subjects and Language 45 hours
Law and Political Economy 15"
Mathematics and Astronomy 27"
Physics and Chemistry 18"
Geology and Mineralogy 15"
Biology, Botany, Zoology and Forestry 20"
Drawing and Surveying 21"
Civil Engineering 16 hours
Mechanical Engineering n"
Electrical Engineering 8"
Chemical Engineering 6"
41"
Elective 8
Total 210 hours
The number of hours in this course common with the several
other six year courses are:
With Civil Engineering 172, with Mechanical Engineering
153, with Electrical Engineering 144, with Chemical Engineering
147, with Marine Engineering 148, with Architecture 147, and
with Geological Engineering 167.
Should the student desire to change from this general to a
more special course at the conclusion of the fourth year, he
could by spending an extra summer session prepare himself to
receive at the end of the sixth year the degree of Master of


Civil, Mechanical, Electrical, Chemical or Geological Engineering
in this Department, or of Master of Science in Forestry in the
Department of Literature, Science and the Arts.
The degrees to he conferred for this course are as follows:
On the completion of 140 hours of work requiring four years
and a summer session, the degree of Bachelor of Science in
Engineering; on the completion of 175 hours of work requiring
five years and a summer session, the degree of Master of Science
in Engineering; on the completion of 210 hours of work as above,
requiring six years and a summer session, the degree of Master
of Conservation Engineering (M.Cn.E.).
More specifically, this course is designed to train men broadly
in those subjects required in developing, conserving and utilizing
the vast resources of nature in the mineral, vegetable, and animal
kingdoms, including the now largely wasted energy of water
power, coal, oil, gas and heat in general; also for the reclamation
of arid lands by irrigation, the improvement of streams for navi-
gation, the storage of water at river heads, the building of high-
ways, and the general development of means for transportation
which will increase in importance as transportation by rail and
steamships becomes more expensive by the exhaustion of iron ore
and fuel supplies; in the discovery and development of substi-
tutes for wood and iron and other materials of construction and
of the arts; in the development of means for utilizing more
directly the energy of the sun. the tides, the waves, and the wind;
in preserving the purity of water supplies, improving the methods
of sewage disposal; and in general the improvement of sanitary
conditions, all of which are in response to the rapidly growing
necessities of the increasing population of the earth.


THE ANNUAL SPRING TRIP.
By Raymond 13. Hoskin.
The main object of this trip is to give the engineering student
a good idea of the practical side of the engineering profession,
and while it is of most value to the student in the mechanical
branch, inasmuch as his specialty will tend towards manufacture,
it is of much interest and value to one taking up any branch of
engineering. The trip is so outlined as to give the members of
the party as broad a view as is possible, and to take in the cities
which are considered to show most typically the various classes
of work.
Two or three members of the faculty accompany the party
in order to point out the most important details and to help the
younger members of the party to appreciate all that can be seen.
By taking this trip with the party you are not only able to
secure rates, thus saving considerable expense, but you have the
advantage of the faculty members' influence. It is no easy mat-
ter for a couple of persons to gain permission to go thru some
of the large plants—the steel mills, for instance—but with the
stronger influence at hand you are able to gain admittance every-
where. And, too, the various things are discussed along the
route, thus tending to fix more clearly in mind the details in the
various operations.
The trip last year was an eastern one, taking in most of the
principal cities in the east, making the vacation a very enjoyable
one, to say nothing of the great instruction gained. Every mem-
ber of the party came back with entirely new ideas concerning
practical engineering, and eacli declared that his money had been
very well spent.
This year the party will leave here on the morning of the
8th of April and will go to Toledo, Cincinnati, Dayton, Chicago,
Milwaukee, Gary and to several points along this route, arriving
in Ann Arbor on the morning of the 18th. This trip will be in
charge of Prof. Allen and the cost of everything, allowing a


reasonable sum for incidentals wil be about $55—$20 cheaper
than the trip last year. It is the opinion of the men in charge
that more can be accomplished in the limited length of time by
going west, since there will not be so much time lost in travelling.
The plants that will be visited are all more modern and more
fully equipped than those in the east.
It is hoped that a good many men will take this trip for such
a thing is needed by all the students who care for a broad view
of the practical side of engineering. The trip is yn education in
itself and is well worth the money put into it.


EDITORIALS.
This issue of The Technic contains several articles which it
has hitherto been impossible to get written up. They are chiefly
of value to the undergraduates who are taking work in Hydraulics
or Structural Mechanics, but may be of much interest to Alumni.
The application of Area Moments to flexure of beams has been
taught at Michigan for many years. It was first used more as
a graphical solution by Prof. Chas. E. Greene but is now taught
as an analytic method for determining the Flexure and Deflection
of Reams. The great simplicity of the method commends it to
practical use.
The article by Prof. Williams on types of dams is one of a
series of lectures given in the course in hydraulics.
The Techn'ic board desires to express its indebtedness to
the members of the Engineering Faculty and others who have so
kindly given us their aid in keeping the paper up to a standard
worthy of the Department.
Contrary to previous announcements the Electrical Illuminat-
ing Number will be published as the Third Technic instead of
the fourth.
The second article on turbine design by Prof. Zowski as
published in a recent number of the Engineering News appears
in this issue. It is to be used as a textbook in his classes. The
three articles are being reprinted and may be obtained in about
a month from the Business Manager of The Technic for 75c.
They are to be bound in paper.
We desire to thank the Alumnus for the loan of the plans
of the new Chemical Building which we used in our first issue.
The election of officers of the Engineering Society has been
held and the new men are taking hold in fine style. The plans
for next year look toward a still larger membership and a more
active society.


THE MICHIGAN TECIINIC
The sections in debating are well under way and meet with
some degree of success. These debating sections are a result of
a speech delivered by Dean Cooley at the Faculty reception last
winter. They are intended to make Engineering students more
proficient in the correct use of the English Language when on
their feet.
We ask every Engineering Alumnus to help us in our publica-
tion by patronizing our advertisers where it is possible to do so.

To the Board of Editors of Thf. Technic:
Having accepted the task of collecting material for this "Elec-
trical Illumination" issue of The Technic, I feel that a little ex-
planation—perhaps an apology—for certain peculiarities in the
form and assemblage of'the material, should be made.
Before inviting the authors of these articles to write for The
Technic, I prepared a synopsis of the entire subject, such as I
have used for my classes in Illumination at the University. I
then sought to find a number of graduates of Michigan who
might be employed or interested specially in Illumination. Being
rather unsuccessful in the search, I decided to approach also men


whom I knew to be specialists in this subject, and was fortunate
to procure acceptances. To each of these men a complete synopsis
was sent, the parts which he was expected to cover being marked
thereon. The purpose of this was to eliminate needless repe-
titions as far as possible.
The impossibility of bringing the contributors together during
the preparation of the papers, the wide range of subjects to be
covered, and possibly also the ambitious nature of my synopsis,
has resulted in a slight incoherence at certain places.
For most of the imperfections due to such causes, I shall take
the responsibility, and simply hope that the reader may be aided
to gain a working insight into a rapidly growing subject of which
the importance is tremendous and the technique as yet only
slightly developed.

By L. D. Goddard.
Henry Harold Higbie was born Nov. 10, 1882, in New York
City where he received his early education in the Public Schools.
In 1896 he won the Pulitzer Scholarship by competitive examin-
ation which gave him eight years free tuition in the Horace
Mann High School (Teacher's College, New York) and Colum-
bia University, New York, in addition to a cash stipend of
$1,750. While at college he won the highest honors in the Engi-
neering Department, among them an additional scholarship and
membership in the Tau Beta Pi Society. Upon graduation he
received the Illig Medal in Applied Science, awarded by the com-
bined vote of the Faculty and the senior class to the best man in
the Engineering Schools of the University. He was graduated
from Columbia in June, 1904, with the degree of Electrical En-
gineer. In February, 1905, he was elected to the Columbia Chap-


ter of the Sigma Xi Society. Immediately upon graduation he
was appointed Assistant in Mechanical Engineering at Columbia
which position he left in February, 1905, to come to the Univer-
sity of Michigan as "instructor in electrical and mechanical en-
gineering." In 1906 his title was changed to "instructor in elec-
trical engineering." By action of the Board of Regents in De-
cember, 1910, he was appointed Assistant Professor in Electrical
Engineering.
Professor Higbie is National Vice-President of Tau Beta Pi
Society and is now secretary of the Michigan Chapter of Sigma
Xi. He is an Associate Member of the American Institute of
Electrical Engineers and also of the American Physical Society
and of the Society for the Promotion of Engineering Education.
Professor Higbie has always taken an active interest in the
Engineering Societies at the University of Michigan and this
year is a member of the Faculty Advisory Board for The
Tech nic. He has written a number of typewritten and mimeo-
graph works and syllabi accompanying lectures in experimental
electrical and mechanical engineering. A year ago Professor
Higbie was asked if he would get together material for an "Elec-
trical Illuminating" issue of The Technic. He consented and
with his characteristic enthusiasm has carried on the work in
spite of his other very numerous duties. To his energy and good
judgment is due entirely the collection of excellent articles which
follow in this number.


THE THEORY AND DEVELOPMENT OF ARTIFICIAL
LIGHTING BY ELECTRICITIY.
George W. Patterson, S.B., Ph.D., Universitv of Michigan.
Historical. Man from remotest antiquity lias had artificial
lights. The savage undoubtedly carried the development as far
as the torch made from resinous wood in the form of pine knots
or their equivalent, which could be kindled from the campfire.
Lamps of very simple design and candles of very crude form
are to be found in the earliest civilization of which we have any
knowledge, and continued in use without essential modifications
until little more than a century ago. In 1783 a step forward by
Leger of Paris who devised a flat wick and burner to replace the
solid round wick; and in 1784 by Argand who invented the round
hollow burner and wick, an arrangement known to the present
generation as the Argand burner. The lamp chimney is also
Argand's invention. It was first of metal and supported above
the flame to improve the draught. Later he substituted the glass
chimney in essentially the form we have it today. Gas lighting
was introduced in England just before the end of the eighteenth
century by Robert Murdoch. In 1801 Sir Humphrey Davy dis-
covered the electric arc, but it was several years before the arc
lamp was improved sufficiently to have the arc maintained for a
reasonable length of time. During the last century the fuel for
lamps was greatly improved in quality and reduced in price be-
cause of the discovery of petroleum, and little more than thirty-
years ago Edison discovered the carbon filament incandescent
lamp for electric circuits. Since that time the art of electric il-
lumination has been revolutionized by improvements in both arc
and incandescent lamps, and gas lighting revolutionized by the in-
vention of the Welsbach mantle. The description of these sources
of light is reserved for a separate chapter.
Nature of Light. Light from the standpoint of physics is
an electromagnetic radiation of such frequency of vibration as to
cause objects from which it radiates to become visible to the eye.


From the physiological standpoint light is the sensation produced
in the eye and transmitted to the brain because of the stimulus
due to this electromagnetic radiation. The stimulus and the sen-
sation are essentially different and must not be confused, though
both are called light. A great deal of research has been devoted
to the relation between the stimulus and the sensation produced,
with the result that for light of a given composition the sensa^
tion has been found to be approximately proportional to the log-
arithm of the stimulus. This relation is known as Fechner's
law. It is evident that the wave length of light has a marked
effect on the sensation produced by a stimulus representing a cer-
tain amount of power. Radiations of lower wave length than
that corresponding to the extreme violet or of higher wave length
than that corresponding to the extreme red, produce no luminous
sensation whatever, as they lie beyond the visible spectrum; and
between these limits as we go from the ends of the visible spec-
trum the sensation for a certain amount of power grows at first
rapidly and then more slowly until a maximum effect is produced
in the green.
The following table shows the relative sensations in various
parts of the spectrum for equal amounts of power, the sensation
in the green being taken as unity:
Violet Blue Green Yellow Orange Dark Red
Wave lengths, meters x io"10... 4000 4700 5300 5800 6500 7500
Luminous sensation 0.016 0.62 1.00 0.28 0.012 o.cooo 1
For mixed light the sensation is dependent on the propositions
of the various components. As all lights used in artificial illumin-
ation have continuous spectra or at least components in various
parts of the spectrum together with non-luminous radiations, it
is a very complicated problem to find the light value of each in
terms of any chosen standard. It is evident from the foregoing
considerations that we find wide divergence in the ratio of power
(watts) and luminous intensity (candle power) in various
sources of light.
The Complete Spectrum. Most bodies when at low temper-
ature radiate electromagnetic waves of too smaal vibration fre-
quency, 1. c, too high wave length, to produce any light. Con-


spicuous exceptions to this general rule are cold bodies which
shine in the dark because of phosphorescence or luminescence.
As the temperature of most cold bodies is raised they change the
composition of their radiations by increasing the portion of short-
er wave length, and at certain temperatures become luminous.
The luminous portion of their spectrum increases not only ab-
solutely but proportionately to the whole also, and the so-called
light efficiency increases also as the temperature increases. Thus
the carbon filament lamp gives no light below certain tempera-
tures and as the current and temperature are increased we may
get under commercial conditions one candle power for four watts
for the older types, one candle power for three watts for most
lamps or one candle power for two and one-half watts for the
metallized filament lamps. If the current is raised beyond that
for which the lamp is designed we may increase the efficiency
even higher but at the expense of short life for the lamp. The
most recent forms of incandescent lamps including Nernst, tan-
talum and tungsten lamps show marked improvement over the
carbon filament lamps; and the tungsten, as at present used com-
mercially, gives one candle power for little more than one watt.
It was early noticed that temperature alone does not determine
the distribution of the radiated power in the various parts of the
spectrum, for each different material has its characteristic distri-
bution of power with its own ratio of candle power per watt at
a certain temperature. To illustrate, the Welsbach gas mantle
lias a high efficiency not because of its high temperature but
rather because of the characteristic spectrum of the rare earths
used in its construction which has a relatively large portion of its
radiations in the visible part of the spectrum. Another illustra-
tion is found in the light-giving powers of the bunsen burner
with and without the admission of air to mix with the gas. The
complete combustion of the gas represents a certain amount of
power but the candle power per watt is very different in the two
cases, the ordinary bunsen flame being practically without light
when air is admitted, and giving considerable light when air is
not admitted. It is therefore evident that the source of lights
commercially best, must depend on the selective radiation being
high in the visible part of the spectrum.
Attention should be called to the danger of injury to the eye


by non-luminous radiation in the portion of the complete spec-
trum of short wave length lying beyond the violet of the visible
spectrum. These so-called ultra violet rays when present in
large amounts are most injurious to the eye and should be elim-
inated. Fortunately common white glass is able to absorb in large
measure the ultra violet rays, while transmitting visible rays with
little loss.
Methods of Producing Light. Until the last century all arti-
ficial lights depended on the incandescence of carbon and with
few exceptions incandescent carbon remained the source of all
lighting for domestic purposes until the closing years of the last
century. The only exception for public lighting from the general
rule was the Drummond lime light or calcium light as it was
sometimes called. For exceptional cases a burning magnesium
ribbon gave a brilliant white light but commercially it was not
used. The incandescence of carbon was the source of light in
the torch of the savage, in the lamps and candles of the ancients
and through modern times was the light giving principle in
all candles, oil lamps and gas lamps until the introduction of
the Welsbach mantle. From the standpoint of chemistry the
savage's torch, the candle and the oil lamp represented a complete
gas manufacturing plant combined with the utilization of the
gas by the consumer, and the introduction of coal gas at the end
of the eighteenth century involved no new principle but simply
divided the manufacture of the gas from its combustion.
The whole process is well illustrated by the burning of the can-
dle. The heat of the flame melts the fuel and the liquid is drawn
through the wick by capillarity when it is heated further and
converted into vapor of hydrocarbon. The heat of the flame
raises the temperature of the vapor beyond its point of chemical
stability and the vapor breaks up by what is known by the chem-
ist as distructive distillation into other hydrocarbons less rich in
carbon and finely divided free carbon. This free carbon is main-
tained at a temperature of incandescence by the burning of the
other component until the oxygen of the air reaching the incan-
descent carbon particles acts as a supporter of combustion for
the carbon itself. Should carbon escape unconsumed from the
flame we say that the flame smokes. The unconsumed carbon as


soot collects on cooler bodies. It is the incandescence of the car-
bon because of the heat of the burning gases rather than the en-
ergy set free by the carbon itself which is the source of light.
Sir Humphrey Davy when he discovered the electric arc in 1801
added another incandescent carbon source of light to those pre-
viously produced by combustion, for Davy used wood charcoal
electrodes for the arc and the carbon torn from the intensely hot
positive electrode together with the carbon in the crater formed
in this electrode and with the less hot negative were the sources
of light. The combustion of the carbon is not the cause of the
light, but the cause is to be sought in the incandescence of the
carbon alone. If the arc is in a space free from oxygen and un-
accompanied by combustion the light is undiminished. This is
practically accomplished by the inclosed arc lamp.
Edison's invention of the carbon filament lamp added yet an-
other lamp based on the incandescence of carbon. In 1825 Cap-
tain Thomas Drummond invented the calcium light commonly
known as the Drummond light in which in the final form a
block of quick-lime is raised to incandescence by means of an
oxyhydrogen flame. Captain Drummond thus made an innova-
tion in lighting by substituting lime for carbon which up to his
time had been the universal source of artificial light. Lime has
the advantage of a very favorable distribution of power in its
spectrum, there being a relatively large radiation in the visible
part. Of this advantage is taken in certain flaming arc lamps
whose electrodes are impregnated with lime.
Mention has been made of the magnesium lamp in which a
magnesium ribbon is burned with the production of a brilliant
white light. At one time the magnesium lamp was used for
photography. At present this source of light is never used, but
magnesium is largely used for flash lights for photographic pur-
poses.
In the last few years the carbon incandescent electric lamp has
had competitors in the way of other incandescent lamps. The
first to appear was the Nernst lamp invented in 1898 by Profes-
sor Nernst then at the University of Goettingen. This lamp de-
parted from Edison's lamp in two essentials, the filament was not
in a vacuum and was made of a variety of porcelain which when
cold was a non-conductor, but became a poor conductor at high


temperatures. The next incandescent lamp was a vacuum lamp,
with a filament of tantalum. The Nernst and the tantalum lamps;
give nearly twice as much light for equal power as does the usual
carbon filament lamp. Closely following these lamps came the
tungsten lamp, also a vacuum lamp, using a filament of the metal
tungsten and giving nearly three times as much light per watt as
the carbon filament lamp. Meanwhile carbon was giving way in
the arc lamp to other substances giving spectra with a better selec-
tive radiation. Under this class come the magnetite and the
flaming arc lamps.
In recent years there has also been great advance in vacuum
lamps in which the source of light is an electric discharge through
vacuum tubes analogous to the Geissler tube. The only commer-
cial developments of importance are the Moore vacuum tube lamp
in which a high vacuum is maintained, the residual gas determin-
ing the color of the light, and the Cooper Hewitt Mercury vapor
lamp.
Measurement of Light. In the measurement of light there
are great difficulties to be overcome. Light being a physiological
phenomenon, its intensity must in the end be referred to the hu-
man eye; and even the eye cannot be relied upon to determine the
ratio of two unequal lights, for the sensation produced is not pro-
portional to the stimulus; but as mentioned earlier is only approx-
imately proportional to the logarithm of the stimulus. In dealing
with lights of different color the eye is most untrustworthy,
though a recent form of flicker photometer has done much to
overcome this difficulty. While the eye cannot determine directly
the ratio of two unequal quantities of light it can determine with
considerable accuracy the equality of two equal quantities of the
same color, and more inexactly if they are of different color.
The apparatus used is called a photometer.
Standards of Light. There is no standard of light in the ab-
solute sense. This lack of an absolute standard cannot be helped
in the nature of things, but civilized man has done his best by
taking as standards the light given by various candles, oil lamps,
vapor lamps and certain areas of molten platinum. None of these
so-called standards are exactly reproducible but by care in the
selection of materials and using correction factors for conditions.


of the atmosphere they all give more or less fixed amounts of
light.
The standards of light which have come down through the
last century have been numerous. Of them only three are of
practical value in this country. A brief'description follows:
The British Standard Candle is for usual purposes our normal
unit in the United States. This candle is made of spermaceti
derived from the fat found in the head of the sperm whale. These
candles weigh 1,200 grains, are about ten inches long, 0.9 inch
diameter at the bottom and 0.8 inch at top, and burn two grains
per minute under standard conditions. This candle has a flame
of variable height depending on the condition of the wick and of
the atmosphere and cannot be relied on closer than 5 per cent.
For good results it must be burned on a candle balance and its
candle power figured on the basis of consumption of the sperm-
aceti, i. c., if it burns more or less than two grains per minute its
intensity is assumed to be in proportion. The color of the flame
is yellow. In general for photometry of electric lamps some sec-
ondary standard such as an incandescent lamp is determined in
terms of the actual average performance of a number of candles,
and the secondary standard is used in practical measurements.
For photometry of gas lights other secondary standards, such as
the Methven screen or the pentane lamp, are used.
The Heincr-Altencck Lamp which burns amylacetate is the
standard in Germany. The wick tube is round and 8.0 mm. in-
side and 8.3 outside diameter. The height of the flame is ad-
justed to 40 mm. by means of a flame gauge mounted at the side
of the lamp. The flame gauge is a focusing lens and ground glass
on which the upper part of the flame is focused by the lens. When
the image of the tip of the flame is focused on a cross mark on
the ground glass the flame is 40 mm. high. The wick is cotton
and does not char appreciably as the amylacetate is very volatile.
The color of the flame is yellow verging on orange. The Hefner-
Altencch lamp gives very uniform results and is far better than
the British standard candle, though the color of the flame has too
much red to be entirely satisfactory. These lamps when imported
from Germany may be bought with the certificate of the Phys-
icalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt as to their being in agreement
with the government standard kept at the Reichsanstalt. The


Hefner unit was supposed to be equal to 0.88 British standard
candle and a unit candle is in general use in the United States
which equals 0.88 Hefner units. The Bureau of Standards at
Washington has made a careful investigation of the probable ra-
tio of this American candle and the British standard candle and
has found differences of from 2 to 5 per cent. It appears to be
impossible to state just what is the correct value of this ratio
but it is probable that the American candle will remain at the
value assumed, i. e., one Hefner unit = 0.88 candle.
In France the Carcel lamp has for many years been the stand-
ard. This lamp burns colza oil at the rate of 42 grams per hour.
The burner is round (Argand burner). The light is supposed
by Bunte to have an intensity of 9.5 candles or 10.87 Hefner
units, while the Reichsanstalt has determined the Carcel to be
10.7 Hefner units. The Carcel lamp is not used in the United
States.
In addition to the above national standards it has been recom-
mended by international congresses that a new unit called the
decimal candle be obtained from molten platinum at the temper-
ature of solidification. One square centimeter of such molten
platinum gives 20 decimal candles. The Hefner unit is supposed
to be 0.885 decimal candle and the British candle 1.009 decimal
candles. It is to be noted that these values do not check with the
assumed ratio of 0.88 between the Hefner and the British units.
A new international candle has been suggested but the writer
fears that it will only add to the present confusion.
Illumination of Surfaces. The illumination of a surface is re-
lated to the intensity of a source of light by the law of inverse
squares and of the cosine. If a surface is supposed to be part
of the surface of a sphere of unit radius with a light source of
unit intensity at the center, the intensity of illumination due di-
rectly to the source is said to be unity. If the radius of the sphere
is R the intensity of illumination is said to be i/R'-. Simply
stated light is supposed to be propagated without loss through
air, and as a sphere of radius R has an area R- times as great as
a sphere of unit radius, the same amount of light is spread over
the greater surface with corresponding reduction in intensity of
illumination. If light falls obliquely on a small surface it falls
on a surface larger than the orthogonal projection on a sphere


whose radius is equal to the average distance of the surface con-
sidered. The area of the projection is smaller in the ratio of the
cosine between the normal to the surface and the radius of the
sphere. Therefore the intensity of illumination is in proportion
to the cosine.
Intensity of illumination is expressed in this country and Eng-
land in foot-candles, i. e., candle power of source divided by
square of distance in feet, the incidence being supposed normal
to the surface. In Germany the meter-hefner is a similar unit.
If the light is in decimal candles and the distance in meters the
name lux has been given to the unit of illumination.
Flux of Light. If a light of unit intensity in all directions is
at the center of a sphere of unit radius it will produce unit in-
tensity of illumination over a surface of area 41-. The flux of
light is defined as the area X the intensity of illumination. It
follows that a unit source emits a flux of 4 jr. A source of power
L emits a flux 4-n-L. In general the flux of light reaching a sur-
face is the surface integral of the intensity of illumination of the
surface considered. The name lumen is used as the flux of light
which will illuminate one square foot with an intensity of one
foot-candle.
Mean Candle Pouvr. No artificial lights have equal intensity
in all directions. If the average value in all directions is
measured the result is the mean spherical intensity. This
equals total flux-4-471-. If the mean value is taken on one side
ot a plane passing through the center of the source, the result
is called the mean hemispherical intensity. If the mean value is
taken for all directions in a horizontal plane passing through the
center of the source the result is called the mean horizontal in-
tensity. If the unit chosen is the candle power these results are
in mean spherical candle power, mean hemispherical candle power
and mean horizontal candle power respectively. It is evident that
mean spherical candle power equals total lumens -4- 4 ir.
To find experimentally the mean spherical candle power it is
evidently impossible to make measurements in every direction,
for the number of possible directions is infinite. It is possible
however to imagine a sphere concentric with the source of light
and to construct a regular polyhedron with its corners in the sur-
face of the sphere. If the candle power of the source is deter-


mined in the direction of the radius drawn to each corner the
mean of all will approximate the mean spherical candle power.
The regular polyhedrons possible are five in number. They are
as follows: regular triangular pyramid (4 sides and corners),
cube (6 sides and corners), regular octahedron (8 sides and cor-
ners), regular dodecahedron (12 sides and 20 corners), regular
icosahedron (20 sides and 12 corners).
This method in practice becomes too complicated, for in locat-
ing the corners in latitude and longitude the circle rea'dings come
out odd amounts for all except the cube.
The zone method is more generally used. If a series of par-
allel planes is passed through a sphere, zones are cut on the sur-
face with areas proportional to the segments of any straight line
intersecting the planes. If the sphere has unit diameter and if
the segments of the diameter of the sphere normal to the inter-
secting planes are taken as the measure of the area of the zones
the length of each segment is numerically equal to the part that
each zone is of the whole area of the surface. If measurements
of the mean spherical candle power are made along the central
line of each zone and the average taken, the weighted average of
these averages for eacji zone may be obtained by the summation
of the zone averages multiplied by the segments of the diameter.
If readings are taken in line with the poles of the zones and at
ten degree intervals along great circles between the poles, the
areas will be half the difference between the sines of the angles
from the central plane midway between the poles. The follow-
ing table gives the numerical values:

In absolute strictness the above values are slightly in error,
as the zone limits should be taken in such a way that the points
at which candle powers are determined should project into points


on the diameter of the sphere midway between the planes of the
bases of each zone and should not be at the middle of the seg-
ments of the great circles from pole to pole. The error however
is unimportant and would greatly complicate the calculations.
A graphical method invented by Rousseau is free from the
error mentioned just above. In this method a polar curve a b c
d c f g is drawn with vectores Oa, Ob, etc., proportionable to
the mean reading for points at equal spacings from the pole. A
circle of unit diameter P Q is drawn concentric with the origin
of the radii vectores and the points where the radii vectores (ex-
tended if necessary) cut this sphere are projected into the diam-
eter of the sphere which is in the line of the radii vectors rep-
resenting the candle power at the poles. From the points of the
diameter thus determined lines P, A, etc., are drawn nornally
equal to the corresponding radii vectors and a curve A B C D E
F G drawn through their other ends. The area P A G Q inclosed
between the end lines, the diameter and the curve is equal to the
mean spherical candle power. The area may be measured by a
planimeter. If the circle should be too small for con-
venient construction, the diameter may be made as
large as desired, but in this ca*e the area found must
be divided by mean spherical candle the diameter to
find power.
The construction is illustrated in Figure I.
If desired the second curve may be drawn on the
other side of the diameter.
The data for the polar curve may be obtained by ro-
tating the lamp (or a system of mirrors) by a suitable apparatus
and the mean value for each zone determined by a single observa-
tion with the photometer. The second curve may be drawn di-
rectly for the polar curve serves no necessary purpose.
Dr. A. E. Kennelly has devised a method for the rectilinear
graphical construction of the spherical reduction factor of a
lamp in which the length of a line drawn to suitable scale gives
mean spherical candle power. The method is described in full
in the Transactions of the Illuminating Engineering Society, Vol.
Ill, No. 4 (April, 1908) pages 243 ct scq.
There are various empirical rules for getting mean spherical


candle power from mean horizontal and the candle power from
the tip, applicable to various types of incandescent lamps. An
empirical formula used formerly assumed that if /„ /45 and Iao
represent the mean values of the horizontal and at 45 ° and at
the tip, we may consider the mean spherical candle power to be
h + 2 /« + ho-
There are certain arrangements of mirrors planned to reflect
to the photometer from various sides of the light source amounts
of light of proper proportion to make the candle power obtained
by a single reading proportional to the mean spherical value.
An example is Matthews' integrating photometer. The Ulbricht
sphere is another "device for obtaining the same result. It con-
sists of a hollow sphere, containing the source of light, painted in-
side with a white paint which diffuses the light. A small window
of diffusing glass set in the surface of the sphere receives diffused
light from all parts of the inner surface of the sphere and as a
secondary source of light emits a quantity proportional to the
mean spherical intensity of the original source. The diffusing
glass window is screened from rays directly from the source.

TREND OF DEVELOPMENT IN LIGHTING.
A century ago when lighting was clone almost exclusively by
candles, it was considered that the lighting was extremely bril-
liant when the total candle power from the present day point of
view was very deficient. During the century past gas lighting
and electric lighting has led to a continuous increase in brilliancy.
So long as the cost of light continues to be reduced so long will
the tendency be to increase the quantity of light used in interior
lighting for it seems to be a well settled rule that man is willing
to pay about a fixed amount for illumination. In the past archi-
tects have been woefully ignorant of the principles of interior
lighting. A change for the better has come with the advent of
the illuminating engineer and it is reasonable to expect that the
artificial lighting of the future will solve the problem of the


distribution of light so as to give effects comparable to diffuse
day light. The Moore vacuum tubes attempt in one way to
solve the problem. The Holophane shades in another way sug-
gest a solution. Lights of large power concealed behind ribbed
glass ceilings offer another solution. They all tend toward better
distribution. But no solution will be entirely satisfactory until
methods are found to produce light radiation of suitable distri-
bution in the spectrum such as to give a maximum of light for a
minimum of power expended. The developments of the last
few years involving the discovery of sources of greatly improved
selective radiation all give promise of the discovery of the cold
light of the future in which practically all the power consumed is
converted into visible radiation.


INCANDESCENT ELECTRIC LAMPS, THEIR PHOTO-
METRY, AND SOME DATA AS REGARDS
THEIR PERFORMANCE.*
Leonard J. Lewinson, E.E., Electrical Testing
Laboratories, N. Y. City.
I. Photometry.
The measurement of intensity of light is accomplished in much
the same way as physical quantitative determinations in general;
in that the method employed consists in evaluating an unknown
quantity in terms of a quantity of known value. The usual method
of making the comparison, however, is purely a visual one,
and the accuracy of measurement depends to a considerable
extent upon the personal equation. This is particularly the case
when light sources of different colors are measured.
In making a photometric measurement there is required some
device which may illuminated by the two light sources and will
permit of the two illumination values being viewed at the same
time. It is not possible for the eye to determine directly the
ratio of these two illumination intensities, but with a sufficiently
sensitive photometric device the eye can readily decide when the
two intensities are equal provided the color values involved are
substantially the same. Photometers are of different types and
based upon various principles.
Types of Photometers.
1. Photometers based on visual acuity.
2. Photometers involving non-optical methods.
3. Photometers which are based upon the fundamental photo-
metric law.
The third class may be subdivided as follows:
(a) Photometers in which distances between photometric
device and light sources are changed.
* This paper was written September I, 1910. New developments in in-
candescent lamps, effected since that date are of necessity omitted.


(b) Photometers employing properties of polarized light.
(c) Photometers making use of diaphragms and dispersion
prisms.
For most commercial work, the variable distance photometer
is in general use.
The principal photometric devices in use in connection with
the third class above mentioned, are the Bunsen and Lummer-
Brodhun instruments with their various modifications.1
The former operates on the principle that a spot of oil or grease
on a sheet of paper appears dark against a light background when
viewed by reflected light, and bright against a dark background
when viewed by transmitted light. It is obvious that the spot
disappears completely if the paper is illuminated equaly on both
sides by light sources of the same color. The Lummer-Brodhun
photometer consists of a diffusing screen and a system of mirrors
and prisms so arranged that two elliptical areas, each illuminated
by one of the light sources, are presented to the eye in juxtapo-
sition. The field of a simple Lummer-Brodhun photometer is
illustrated in Fig I. The diffusing screen being opaque, this
photometric device is free from any difficulties which may be
introduced in the Bunsen screen by the transparency of the paper
and grease spot. The contrast photometer of the Lummer-Brodhun
type has the same general construction as the simple instrument,
excepting that small plates of glass are placed on the face of one
of the prisms, producing a field as shown in Fig. 2. When the
photometer is balanced, the central portions of the two semi-
elliptical fields appear equally contrasted with the surrounding
portions of the fields.
The flicker photometer provides an effective means of measur-
ing candle-power and represents an attempt to facilitate compari-
son of two sources of light of different colors. In the Simmance-
Abady type2 the rotating disk presents to the eye a field illum-
inated first by one source and then by the other. The Schmidt
and Haensch photometer3 employs a plaster of paris wedge,
the two sides of which are respectively illuminated by the two
light sources under comparison. The flicker is produced by the
rotation of a cylindrical lens in front of the wedge. The form of
field is illustrated on Fig. 3, the portion, A, appearing bright when
the portion, B, appears dim, and vice versa. When the photo-


meter is balanced, both portions of the surface appear equally
illuminated, and the flicker disappears. It is a question at the
present time, as to whether or not the phenomenon of persistence
of vision, which varies for different colors, presents a serious
obstacle to the application of the flicker instrument to the meas-
urement of sources of light of different colors.4

In order to make a photometric measurement with one of
these devices, it must be so placed that the relative distances be-
tween photometer and lamps may be varied until a balance is
effected. If the proper physical requirements are met with, the
inverse square law may then be applied, and the intensity of
one source in terms of the other be determined by a simple com-
putation.
Photometer Bench.
To provide a means of varying the distance between photometer
and lamps, a photometer bench or track is used, the photometer
being placed between the two lamps. With respect to the rela-
tive positions of lamps and photometers, there are three general
methods of making the tests. In the first method, the photometer
is movable while the distance between the two lamps remains
fixed; in the second method, the distance between the photometer
and the source of light under test remains constant, while the
standard lamp is moved; in the third method, the lamp under
test remains fixed while the photometer and standard lamp are
both moved, the distance between them remaining fixed. The
last arrangement has the advantage of uniform illumination on
the disk when it is balanced regardless of the intensity of the
source being measured. The fixed photometer with movable


standard lamp is a particularly valuable arrangement in tests
of distribution of light, where it is important to maintain an
unvarying distance between the source being measured and the
photometer. This method also promotes personal comfort, es-
pecially when the photometer is equipped with a sight tube.
Photometer Scales.
Photometer scales are usually calibrated in three ways. First,
a scale of equal parts may be used. This involves a computation
of candle-power after each setting but must be used if varying
relative distances between both lamps and the photometer are
required in different tests. Secondly, a direct candle-power scak
may be employed. This type of scale can be applied if the dis-
tance between the two lamps remains fixed or if there is a con-
stant distance between the photometer and one of the lamps.
Thirdly, a ratio scale may be used. This scale is simply a modi-
fication of the second type with unity taken as a basis. The read-
ing has to be multiplied by a factor depending upon conditions
imposed by the calibration of the photometer by means of stand-
ard lamps. In some factory photometers of the first type, the
scale moves with the photometric device and is calibrated in volts
instead of candle-power. A separate scale must be provided for
each range of voltage, the center of this scale corresponding to
the particular voltage rating of the lamps included in a given
test.
Method of Balancing.
The actual method of balancing depends upon the concept
formed by the observer as to what a true balance means. This
concept varies considerably among different observers. Theoreti-
cally, the Bunsen photometer is balanced when there is an equal
contrast between the grease spot and the surrounding field on
both sides of the screen, and the simple Lummer-Brodhun photo-
meter is balanced when the line of demarcation between the
two fields disappears. The contrast Lummer-Brodhun photo-
meter is balanced as explained above, when the central por-
tions of the two fields are equally contrasted with the surround-
ing portions.


Standardisation.
The standards used in industrial incandescent lamp work are,
as a rule, carefully seasoned and standardized incandescent lamps.
The sources of light under measurement are not directly com-
pared to these lamps, but are compared to a working standard
lamp which has been previously calibrated in terms of the sec-
ondary standards. This substitution method of photometry is
eminently satisfactory if consistently carried out. The working
standard lamp must be a lamp of reasonable constancy, that is,
it should not change appreciably in candle-power during a period
of several hours continuous use. The secondary standards should
be used at intervals throughout a series of tests to check the work-
ing standard lamp. The substitution method offers the advantage
of preservation of the secondary standard lamps, since they are
only in use a few minutes at a time, and eliminates many sources
of error because the lamps to be tested are placed in the same
socket in which the secondary standards which were used to
check the working standard lamp were operated. Ideal condi-
tions obtain when standard lamps, working standards and lamps
to be measured are similar in all respects. If the voltmeter is
found to have a practically constant error over the portion of the
scale which is constantly in use, the substitution method renders
checking and application of corrections to voltmeter readings,
unnecessary.
Disturbing Influences.
There are a number of factors which influence results of photo-
metric tests, chief among which are color, eye fatigue, intensity
of illumination and personal comfort. The effect of color varies
considerably among different observers, but color difference al-
ways has a very disturbing effect on the accuracy of photometric
settings. In the Lummer-Brodhun photometer, for instance, the
optical illusion which causes the line of demarcation between the
two fields to disappear when the illumination on the two sides
becomes equal, does not exist when the two sources are of dif-
ferent colors. The difficulty of evaluating a light source of one
:olor in terms of a source of a different color is due to physiologi-
cal and psychological characteristics which influence the observer.
Among the physiological features are color blindness, yellow


spot effect and "Purkinje" effect.5 The psychological effects de-
pend upon the type of photometer used and' the observer's con-
ception of the appearance of the field when balanced. This con-
ception depends largely upon memory and experience and may
vary from time to time. It is obvious that fatigue of the eye
will influence photometric results. The question of personal
comfort appears to be very important. If an observer is required
to assume a cramped or uncomfortable position, it is very likely
that the precision of photometric setting and accuracy of meas-
urement will be affected.
Within reasonable limits, high intensity of illumination upon
the field of a photometer is desirable, as a small variation in in-
tensity is more readily detected on a higher illuminated field.
Accuracy and Precision.
The accuracy of photometric measurements depends largely
upon the experience of observers. With skilled operators, using
the most sensitive instruments, photometric errors should not
exceed l/z of one per cent., while under good conditions with a
reasonable amount of care on the part of the observer, from
i% to 2% may be considered as a criterion of accuracy. With
regard to precision, skilled observers have obtained a value of
0.25 of 1% for the Lummer-Brodhun photometer and 0.4 of 1%
for the Bunsen photometer. These values represent the average
variation of a given observation from the mean of about 25 con
secutive measurements.
Measurement of Mean Spherical Candle-power.
The measurement of mean spherical candle-power may be ac-
complished in a number of ways. In the Franklin Institute
tests, carried on during the International Exhibition of 1884,0 in-
tensity of illumination was measured at a series of equidistant
points on a sphere described about the illuminant. Later modi-
fications of this method consisted in measuring the distribution of
light in a mean vertical plane and computing the mean spherical
candle-power by means of one of several methods. More re-
cently, there have been developed photometers which dispense
with these cumbersome calculations and which provide for the


23
measurement of mean spherical candle-power with a fair degree
of accuracy with a single setting. The Matthews integrating
photometer7 employs in connection with some type of photo-
metric screen a system of mirrors spaced at uniform angles in a
vertical plane about a semi-circular frame. The mirrors are ad-
justable with regard to distance from the lamp, which is placed
at the center of the frame and rotated on its vertical axis. An-
other integrating instrument is the Uubricht sphere.8 The inside
of the sphere is painted white, and there is a small circular open-
ing in the surface, into which is fitted the test plate of a suit-
able illumination photometer. The lamp or lighting unit to be
measured is placed in a socket provided for the purpose and
maintained in a stationary position. The test plate is shielded
from the direct light of the source under test. Under proper
conditions of standardization, the illumination on this plate will
be directly proportional to the mean spherical candle-power of
the lamp or unit under test.
Illumination Photometers.
Another class of photometers include those employed princip-
ally in the measurement of illumination. These are usually of a
portable type. The Weber photometer9 utilizes a diffusing test
plate to receive the illumination intensity to be measured, and a
modification of the Lummer-Brodhun screen, by means of which
the illumination from the test plate is compared to the light from
a similar plate illuminated by the standard lamp. The Sharp-
Millar photometer10 also employs a test plate and a system of
prisms, and may be readily used for measuring luminous intensi-
ties as well as illumination values covering a very large range.
The flexibility of this photometer is in part secured by the use
of absorbing screens. Both of these photometers are standard-
ized by producing a known illumination upon the test plate by
means of a standard lamp adjusted at a known distance.
The reading distance photometer11 or illuminometer depends
upon visual acuity, and employs a printed card with type of
various sizes. The operation of this photometer consists in
placing it at a distance at which a certain size of type is just
distinguishable. The instrument must be calibrated in terms of
a known illumination for each size of print.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Color Determination.
The spectrophotometer provides for a comparison of two
sources of light with regard to their color components. The
relative proportions of the different wave lengths in two sources
of light may be determined by means of this instrument.12
The Ives colorimeter is an instrument for the comparison of
illuminants in terms of three standard colors,—red blue and
green.13
II. Lamp Performance and Data.
The efficiency of an incandescent electric lamp is of extreme
importance not only as regards economy of power consumption,
but also as a factor which directly affects the life of a lamp. The
true industrial efficiency of an incandescent lamp as a light pro-
ducer is the ratio of total light produced to the electrical energy
expended, both factors being expressed in the same unit. This
ratio is not easy to determine because of the difficulties in the
computation of the mechanical equivalent of light14 which in-
volves experimentation subject to many sources of error. From
a commercial point of view, the amount of light expressed in
some arbitrary unit, given out with a certain expenditure of
electrical power, expressed in watts, is to all purposes an indi-
cation of the efficiency of the lamp. Unfortunately, the term
"Watts-per-candle," which really expresses an inefficiency, lias
come into popular use among lamp manufacturers and consum-
ers. This expression has the additional disadvantage of implying
mean horizontal candle-power,—a value which has become es-
tablished in rating of lamps. The correct practical unit of effi-
ciency is the candle-power per watt, and this candle-power should
be expressed in terms of mean spherical candle-power, so that
lamps having filaments of a given material though of differing
shapes, and consequently differing spherical reduction factors, may
be properly compared. The efficiency may also be expressed by the
term "lumens per watt," the lumen being the unit of total light
flux, and equivalent to the mean spherical candle-power multi-
plied by 4 w.


25
Efficiency.
The commercial efficiency of a given type of lamp is depend-
ent upon the luminous efficiency or efficiency of radiation, ex-
pressed as the ratio of energy radiated in the visible spectrum to
the energy radiated through the entire range of wave lengths.
As the temperature at which a filament is operated is increased,
this ratio becomes greater thereby increasing the commercial
efficiency. Selective emission,15 which is a departure from black
or gray body radiation may also increase luminous efficiency and
thereby the commercial efficiency of a lamp. There is a certain
amount of evidence that some of the types of metallic filaments
exhibit the phenomenon of selective radiation.
Useful Life.
The life of an incandescent lamp of a given type varies with
the efficiency at which the lamp is burned. Fig. 4 shows a

curve of carbon filament life variation with watts-per-candle
value and small range. The useful life of a lamp is considered
as the period during which the lamp can be economically operated,
the factors involved being the cost of lamp renewals, the rate of
deterioration of candle-power and the cost of current. The so-
called theoretical smashing point or end of useful life may be
computed for any type of lamp if the above factors are taken
into consideration. The actual smashing point may, in addition
to the above considerations, depend to some extent upon the ap-
pearance of the lamps after having been burned for some time,
and upon the policy of the lighting company especially if the lamps
are furnished on a free renewal basis.
For multiple burning carbon filament lamps it has been the
practice for many years to consider the useful life exhausted
when the candle-power of the lamp has decreased to 80 per cent,
of its initial value. This 80 per cent, criterion has been partic-
ularly used in lamp tests. It has also been applied to metallized
filament lamps and in the absence of any other criterion it may
extend to metallic filament lamps such as Tantalum and Tung-
sten. In the smaller sizes of Tungsten and Tantalum lamps the
tendency has been for the filament to burn out before the candle-
power reached 80 per cent, of the initial value; in some of the
larger sizes of Tungsten lamps, however, the candle-power de-
crease has been more rapid and many of the lamps reach 80 per
cent, before burning out.
Under good conditions of operation and efficiency the period
of usefulness of an incandescent lamp is of course dependent
upon the strength, purity and homogeniety of the filament and
the condition of vacuum. A filament composed of two or
more independent loops joined in series by a welding or pasteing
process must have all its component parts of equal electrical
dimensions as one loop of relatively high resistance will operate
at a higher temperature than the remaining loops and the life of
the lamp will be dependent upon the efficiency at which this loop
is burning rather than the efficiency of the lamp taken as a whole.
Similarly, a small spot of high resistance in a continuous filament
will cause a rapid deterioration and short life of a lamp. Lamps
whose bulbs have not been exhausted to a sufficient degree will
have a life of short duration.


Important Types of Incandescent Filament Lamps.
I. Untreated Carbon Filament™—produced by baking "form-
ed" filaments of structureless cellulose until they are reduced to
carbon. These filaments have high specific resistance, and are
principally used for sign lamps and 200-volt lamps. A useful
life of from 400 to 600 hours may be obtained at 3.94 watts-per-
mean-horizontal candle-power.
II. Treated or Flashed Carbon Filament Lamps17—produced
by passing current through untreated filaments in an atmosphere
of hydrocarbon gas, thereby depositing a layer of carbon on the
filament. The filament thus becomes more homogenous and of
higher efficiency. The specific resistance of this filament is
lower than that of the untreated. It cannot, therefore, be satis-
factorily applied to lamps of very low candle-power value at
no volts such as sign lamps or to 200 volt lamps. Treated fila-
ment lamps may have a life of from 400 to 500 hours (to 80 per
cent, of initial candle-power) at 3.05 watts-per-mean-horizontal-
candle-power. They are most successful in sizes of from 25 to
100 watts.
III. Metallized Filament Lamps1*—produced by first sub-
jecting the untreated carbon filament to the action of an electric
furnace, then treating the filament and finally repeating the elec-
tric furnace process at a different temperature. The carbon be-
comes graphitized and displays certain metallic properties, prin-
cipal among which is a positive temperature coefficient. Metal-
lized filament lamps have a life of from 400 to 600 hours at 2.5
w. p. c.
IV. Tantalum Lamps19—produced by drawing tantalum wire
to the required dimensions. The resistance is low and a long
filament is required for 100 to 130 volt lamps.
V. Tungsten Lamps™—produced by a number of processes.
Three of the principal ones are the paste process, the deposition
process and the colloidal process. Most filaments for tungsten
lamps, ranging from 100 to 130 volts, consists of a number of
independent loops, welded or clamped together. Continuous fila-
ments are being introduced by one manufacturer.
It is understood that experiments have been made to produce
ductile tungsten. It is expected that drawn tungsten wire will be

successfully produced in the near future and that the introduction
of this drawn wire, if accomplished, will make possible a type
of Tungsten lamp somewhat more rugged than the present type.

The above values are based upon manufacturers' published
data and the results of authoritative tests. The life values are
stated to be conservative—and applicable to ordinarily good
service conditions. It is important to note that all values are given
in terms of the new unit of candle-power which was adopted by
the Bureau of Standards at Washington in July, 1909. The values
are also based upon the wattage system of rating which was first
applied when the GEM lamps were introduced. Later the Tung-
sten and Tantalum lamps were rated on a wattage basis and still
more recently the carbon lamp has fallen in line.
Before the introduction of the GEM lamp and the metal fila-
ment lamps, carbon lamps were furnished in three principal effi-
ciencies corresponding to 3.1, 3.5 and 4.0 watts-per-candle. These
different efficiencies were designed for varying conditions in


regulation. For example, 3.1 w. c. p. were used when the best
regulation was obtainable and 4.0 w. c. p. lamps were used for
railway work in which large voltage fluctuations obtained and
long life is an important factor. (The importance of close regu-
lation on incandescent lighting circuits may be realized by an
examination of Figure 4, which shows that a change from 3.1 to
3.0 w. c. p. which is equivalent to approximately 1 per cent, in-
crease in voltage decreases the life 17 per cent.)
The three efficiency method of rating lamps was unsatisfactory
from the manufacturers' point of view in that it meant a large
variety of stock. This difficulty gave promise of increasing to
enormous proportions when the introduction of new types of
lamps became imminent. The scheme of rating lamps on a wat-
tage basis and labeling them with three voltages was evolved, the
idea being that lamps were to be used at top voltage if the regu-
lation was good, middle voltage if the regulation was fair and
bottom voltage if the regulation was poor. Certain economic
conditions might also enter into the choice of voltage. It should
not be lost sight of, however, that the three voltage rating does
not quite take the place of the three efficiencies previously used
because the voltages are two volts apart under the new system,
whereas there is a difference of over three volts between 3.1 and
3.5 w. c. p. and over four volts between 3.5 and 4.0 w. c. p.
Scries Burning Lamps.
These lamps are of the same general types as the multiple
lamps enumerated above, but are selected and assorted with re-
gard to their current values rather than their voltage values, so
that they may be burned in series. The usual arrangement is five
in series on a circuit of approximately 550 volts, as in the case
of street railway work. The principal lamps used for this work
are as follows:

Street Series Lamps.
Street series lamps designed to operate on constant current
circuits are manufactured in the treated carbon filament and
tungsten filament types. The filaments of these lamps are shorter
and very much more stocky than the multiple lamps of the cor-
responding candle-power. The carbon filament lamps may be
obtained in the 3.5 watts-per-candle type, the usual current values
being 1.75, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 5.5, 6.6, 7.5, and 9.6, and the candle-power
ranging from 16 to 100. Tungsten series lamps are largely sup-
planting the older type. They are designed to operate at from
1.0 to 1.25 watts-per-candle, and are manufactured in the fol-
lowing sizes:
1.75 amp. range; 31, 40, 50 and 75 watts.
3.5 amp. range; 31, 40, 50, 75 and too watts.
4.0 amp. range; 31, 40, 50, 75 and 100 watts.
5.5 amp. range; 31, 40, 50, 75 and 100 watts.
6.6 amp. range; 31, 40, 50, 75 and 100 watts.
7.5 amp. range; 40, 50, 75 and 100 watts.
250 watt series burning lamps have also been produced. The
approximate life of tungsten series lamps operated at 1.2 watts-
per-candle is conservatively stated as 1000 hours, and at 1.25
watts-per-candle, 1300 to 1350 hours.
Miscellaneous Types.
Small tungsten lamps consuming approximately 2j4 and 5
watts have been designed for use in connection with electric signs.
These lamps require from 10 to 13 volts, and are usually operated
in connection with a transformer. Their life is estimated at
2000 hours, at 1.25 watts-per-candle.
Train Lighting Lamps.
Lamps for train lighting have been developed in the carbon,
metallized, tungsten and tantalum filament types. The filaments
are usually mounted in small round bulbs, and the voltages range
from 30 to 60. These lamps are operated at the usual efficiencies
for filaments of the various types.
Beside the foregoing, there are numerous types of lamps, such
as miniature, decorative, surgical, stereopticon, and lamps de-
signed for other special purposes.


33
Frosted Lamps.
It is common practice to frost lamps either wholly or in part
for decorative purposes or to lower the intrinsic brilliancy. Ex-
periments have been made to determine the effect of frosting,
particularly with reference to carbon filament lamps and it has
been found that the absorption coefficient of the frosting on lamps
of the 16 candle-power size varies from 3.8 to J.0%21 (mean
spherical candle-power basis). The useful life or life to 80% of
a frosted carbon lamp is about l/2 of the useful life of the clear
lamp. This is due to a more rapid decrease in candle-power.
Investigations have shown that the end of the useful life, at
which point the candle-power is 80% of the initial value, the
diminution of candle-power has been effected as follows:
Increase in resistance reduces the candle-power to 97%. Bulb
discoloration, as in a clear bulb lamp, decreases the candle-power
to 92%. Additional absorption by the carbon deposit to which
the frosting subjects a portion of the light, further reduces the
candle-power to 87%, while dust accumulation on the surface of
the bulb finally reduces the candle-power to 80% ."
Characteristic Curves.
The variation of candle-power, watts, and watts-per-candle,
with increase and decrease of voltage, is shown for the carbon.
Gem, tantalum and tungsten lamps on Fig. 5. The carbon lamp
is taken as consuming 3.1 watts-per-mean-horizontal candle-
power, Gem lamp as 2.5, the tantalum lamp as 2.0, and the tung-
sten lamp as 1.25 watts-per-mean-horizontal candle-power at
100% voltage. In the case of the carbon filament lamp, which has
practically a zero temperature coefficient, the wattage is pro-
portional to the square of the voltage. In the other types of
lamps, due to the positive temperature coefficient which is great-
est in the case of the tungsten lamp, the watts and therefore the
candle-power increase with increase of voltage to a lesser extent.
It is interesting to note that the indications are that the variation
of life with voltage are of a smaller order for tungsten lamps
than for carbon.

Distribution of Light.
The distribution of light about an incandescent lamp is de-
pendent upon the type of filament and shape of bulb. The hori-
zontal distribution curve of an incandescent lamp is usually of a
circular or elliptical form with sharp peaks or indentations at in-
tervals, depending upon the construction of the filament. The
mean distribution in vertical planes is usually determined, this
being effected by rotating the lamp on its vertical axis, while
measurements at various angles in the vertical plane are taken.
Fig. 6 illustrates the vertical and horizontal distribution of
light about an oval anchored carbon filament lamp.

candle-power and hence at the same efficiency, will show very
different apparent efficiencies if considered from the point of
watts-per-mean horizontal candle-power.
The distribution of light about a tantalum lamp is shown on
Fig. 9. Two curves are given, one representing a new lamp and
the other representing the lamp after having burned 700 hours
on direct current at rated efficiency. The change in the distri-
bution of light is due to the discoloration of the bulb, which is
concentrated in the form of a band about one inch wide in the
case of tantalum lamps.23
Fig. 10 shows the distribution of light about two forty-watt
tungsten lamps, one having a clear bulb and the other partly
frosted.
Spherical Reduction Factor.
The spherical reduction factor, defined as the ratio of mean
spherical candle-power to mean horizontal candle-power, is of
considerable importance when lamps of different types are being
compared. The following table shows the average values for
different types of lamps. Individual lamps of a given type vary
considerably, so that the figures given below must be taken as
approximate.
TYPE REDUCTION FACTOR

-Oval Anchored 0.825
Single Loop 0.810
Double Loop 0.805
Spiral Coil o.aSo
Flat Elliptical Coil 0.085
Vertical Spiral • 0.940
Metallized Filament:
Double Loop 0.820
Oval Anchored 0.825
Tantalum Filament 0.770
Tungsten Filament 0.78 to 0.79
The spherical reduction factor is of course affected by frosting
or partly frosting the bulb, and is also affected by the bulb discol-
oration. This latter effect is very marked in the case of the tan-
talum lamp, which has an increasing reduction factor throughout
its life."

REDISTRIBUTION OF LIGHT.
E. N. HYDE, HOLOPHANE COMPANY, NEW YORK CITY.
Introductory.
The synopsis of the subject matter to be covered by the contri-
butions to this issue of "The Michigan Technic" justifies the
assumption that, when reference is made to electric illuminants
and the natural distribution of the light flux emitted by them,
the reader will recall polar diagrams graphically representing the
distribution in each case. It may be necessary, however, to again
direct attention to these distribution curves so that the effective-
ness of the devices mentioned in this article may be emphasized.
This paper relates particularly to globes, reflectors and shades,
but must contain allusions to the subjects alloted to others. The
writer therefore trusts that his references will be readily identi-
fied and repetition generously overlooked.
Certain radiant energy propagated in waves of certain lengths
and velocities, is physiological in its effect—i. e., visible or lum-
inous to the human eye—and subject to the influence of the
media by which it is surrounded or through which it may pass.
These media are classified as follows,—opaque, translucent and
transparent, respectively, as the propagations are stopped, re-
tarded, or pass through with comparatively little resistance. Of
those waves which reach the media, some may be distorted from
their original forms, their lengths increased and their number per
second changed. When this takes place to a degree sufficient to
eliminate the physiological effect, we have what is generally
known as "absorption," since the luminous energy has been con-
verted into non-luminous heat energy. Here again a difference
in the physical properties of the media becomes apparent, for
depending upon their native qualities, they are selective in their
action, being possibly opaque to all but one kind of wave, when the
phenomenon of color results. When two or more waves pass
through the media, the physiological effect is what we express as


41
"tint" or hue. The subject of color is foreign to the purpose of
this paper and no further reference to it will be made, except to
state that opaque substances may absorb much of the total energy-
directed to them and yet turn back one or more propagations re-
maining, so that either monochromatic or complex color effects
also result. (Reference to absorption is made later on when
comparing the qualities of reflectors).
In illumination, the application of the above principles is em-
ployed, and redistribution of light flux by means of globes and
reflectors about a light source is accomplished. Before this re-
distribution can be efficiently obtained, the nature of the light
sources themselves must be considered. In actual practice, no
point source artificial electric illuminant is available. The distri-
bution of light flux around a point source is in the form of a
sphere, and would be graphically represented by a circle with the
point source for the center. In practice, the objects to be seen
are regarded as the ''plane of illumination'' and to be distinguished
the light flux must be directed to these objects which in turn re-
flect the light so that it reaches the eye of the observer. The
distribution of light flux from a point source of known intensity
on a horizontal plane four feet below is shown in Fig. 1. It rep-
resents a theoretical condition, since no point sources are avail-
able. The computed values of light intensities on the plane are
determined by application of the law of inverse squares. It is
easily discernible that only a small portion of the total flux
reaches the plane. If two or more such light sources were placed
above the plane, the illumination resulting would at a given point
be the arithmetical sum of the values of the light flux of all the
sources. In practice it is possible to group light sources and
regard them as a unit source, since the light flux is blended, filling
one irregularly shaped zone and the photometric value of inten-
sity in any direction can be taken of the group as a whole. Like-
wise, a mercurial vapor tube may be considered either as a series
of contiguous surfaces forming a line source, or the resulting
intensity of the entire tube measured as a unit, and the distribu-
tion graphically portrayed. The naural distribution of most all
light sources, however, is not ideal, and in the majority of cases
the light flux is dispersed where it is useless. This is evident
since the light never reaches the objects to be discerned, and there-


1

43
fore can not be reflected to the eye of the observer. Fig. 2 graph-
ically represents the natural distribution of light flux about a
100 watt tungsten lamp. A line drawn at right angles to and
midway between the bends and welds of the filaments of an in-
candescent lamp, divides into two zones the field of light flux
about the lamp. Above the line is what is known as the 'Hipper
hemisphere/' and below, the "lower hemisphere."

The purpose of any redirecting globe or reflector is generally
to collect much of the light flux of the upper hemisphere and
add it to the flux in the lower hemisphere. The function of the
light controlling device, however, does not end here. Many beams
ot light in the lower hemisphere may, in certain cases, travel else-
where than toward the objects to be seen, that is, toward the
plane of illumination. It is entirely practicable to control the
light flux in both the upper and the lower hemispheres in such
a manner that, suiting conditions, a majority of beams in both


THE MICHIGAN TECHN1C
hemispheres will be directed to the plane of illumination. Since
this is accomplished by means of globes and reflectors, and these
globes and reflectors act on separate principles, it is necessary to
classify them. As before mentioned, the material of which they
are made may be opaque, translucent or transparent. The opaque
reflector, if shaped so as to surround the light source, except for
a portion of the lower hemisphere, will prevent any flux reach-
ing the upper hemisphere. See reflector and curve No. 3. The

light flux in the zone below the open portion of the reflector will
be distributed in a manner depending upon the reflecting quality
and contour of the surface of the device used. The efficiency
of the reflector, regardless of distribution, depends on the amount
of luminous energy which remains after, by absorption, a por-
tion of it has been converted into non-luminous or heat energy.
From this it is evident at once that quality of material is as es-
sential to efficiency in globes or reflectors as are their shapes.
Translucent materials may possess undesirable absorption char-


45
acteristics, but unlike opaque materials, permit some light flux
to remain in the upper hemisphere. Transparent substances have
low absorption characteristics, and, were it not for peculiar prop-
erties which some possess—glass shaped into prisms, for example
—permit as much light flux to permeate the upper and lower
hemispheres as would if the transparent medium were absent.
This is true except for a slight decrease in the total flux due to
absorption, which is so low in many cases, however, that it rep-
resents only a small percent of the total visible radiation.
Keeping in mind these qualities of material, the classification
of reflecting medium must further be considered with respect
to the kind of reflection with which it acts. Prismatic globes,
while acting by reflection largely, also in certain cases effect re-
disribution through reflection and refraction combined. Refrac-
tion enters into prismatic reflector design, but to a much lesser
degree than in prismatic globes, and for convenience we will treat
globes separately, taking up first the subject of reflectors and
reflection. Disregarding the phenomena of absorption and se-
lectivity as applying to color, we will consider reflection as of
two kinds, diffuse and regular, and will assume the light flux
to be approximately white. Fig. 4 shows a surface enlarged many
times. Owing to its natural roughness, this surface shows many


irregularities. Fig. 5 shows the same surface, from which the
irregularities have been removed until a polish is obtained. In
Fig. 5 a beam of light from a point source "A" is directed at an
angle of 45 degrees to the polished surface. By a well known
physical law, the beam is reflected by the polished surface at an
angle of 45 degrees, the angle of reflection always being equal to
the angle of incidence. This phenomenon is named regular or
specular reflection. (Speculum, Latin for mirror). Reflectors
which act by this principle have polished surfaces, for example,
polished aluminum (opaque), glazed porcelain (translucent) and
prismatic glass (transparent). Referring again to Fig. 4, we
discover that the same beam striking the irregular surface at an
angle of 45 degrees as before, has certain parts or rays obstructed
by the irregularities. The surface of each irregularity now reg-
ularly reflects its incident ray, and if the rays are sent out in all
of the angles completing 360 degrees, true theoretical diffuse
reflection is obtained. Fig. 6 shows the rays composing the beam
scattered in all directions towards the surface of a sphere, the
beam no longer being intact. Perfect diffuse reflection is scarce-
ly ever obtained in practice, and a so-called diffusing surface
may, as a whole, act as an imperfect regular reflector. The side
of a white building a mile away from the observer, or snow-
capped mountain peaks serve as examples where this phenomenon
can be observed.
Reflectors which act in this manner are always rough on their
reflecting surfaces, for example, satin aluminum (opaque) and
sand blasted or acid etched porcelain (translucent). It is not
possible, with the surface matted or irregular, to retain the trans-
parency of glass, i. e., have it appear colorless, and at the same
time obtain diffuse reflection. Here, however, it may be stated
that due to the peculiar phenomena of prisms, properly used,
the beam may be broken by them into its component rays. Later
on, the manner of this will be considered. However, many re-
flectors combine the principles of regular and diffuse reflection,
and for convenience will be considered separately. The phenom-
enon of diffuse reflection will take place on any roughened sur-
face regardless of its contour—flat, circular, fluted, etc. Fxcept
for the interception of certain rays by the sides of a deep reflec-
tor, not possible with flat reflectors, the distribution is about the


47
same with any form of reflector acting by diffuse reflection only.
(See Lansingh's lecture before Philadelphia Section, Illuminat-
ing Engineering Society, November, 1909). Where wide range
Fi

in light control is demanded, it should be quite apparent that re-
flectors classified as diffuse should not be used. As a class they
are more or less effective relatively as the materials of which they


are made have low or high light absorbing qualities. The mater-
ial may be opaque or translucent to suit the specific conditions
under which the reflectors are to operate, but the characteristic
distributions in the lower hemisphere are similar.
To obtain any considerable range in redistribution of light flux,
reflectors acting by regular or specular reflection alone are em-
ployed. They are mainly composed of polished metal, sectors of
mirror surfaced glass or prismatic glass. A pendant bare incan-
descent lamp placed under a polished metal parabolic or cone
reflector has its light spread broadly in the lower hemisphere, or,
if properly shaped, the reflector will send the light downward
concentrated upon the plane below. The image of the filament
will, however, be reflected in distorted shape, and objectionable
streaks or striations will be apparent. Frosting the lamp, which
results in the absorption of 5 to 10% of the total flux emitted by
the filament, is an extravagant method of removing these streaks.
Physiological efficiency, that is the ability to see, more than offsets
this diminution in the luminous flux from frosting. Sectors of
polished metal or mirror glass will also distribute the light flux
over contracted or broad area, depending upon the angle at
which they receive the incident rays. If broad sectors are used,
as in an ordinary cone mirror reflector, the image of the filament
again shows in streaks or striations. This is true only to a com-
paratively small extent with prismatic reflectors, the transparent
medium by which regular reflection is accomplished.
. Before the results obtainable from prismatic reflectors are dis-
cussed, it is well to look into the principles which account for the
phenomena of light control resulting from their use. The apex
of a prism is usually formed by two surfaces coining together at
right angles. Fig. 7 shows graphically how prismatic reflection
occurs. In practice the source is not a point. Instead, it is a
thread of light when the filament of an incandescent lamp is
used, and the prisms may be curved so that the various beams or
even their component rays are redirected as desired. Many rays
do not strike the surface at the required angle to be reflected to
the opposing surface. These rays may and do stray through the
reflector into the upper hemisphere. Referring to Fig. 7 again,
it is seen that certain rays pass through at the apices of the
prisms, and others where the valley is formed, apparently un-


fi a ar&lt;s 3.


changed in direction. These too are added to the light in the
upper hemisphere. By far the majority of rays striking the
prisms, however, are sent back and redirected. With the prism,
therefore, it is possible to vary the distribution over a wide range
most efficiently. Fig. 8 shows the same process described in
Fig. 7, but with the prism viewed vertically to the line of vision.
Diagram B, Figure 8 shows the prism and the course taken by the
beam 1-2-3-4, Fig. 7 and also indicates how the downward direc-
tion of the beam follows. Diagram A shows the same phenom-
enon, the reflecting surfaces being looking-glass mirrors, their
edges coming together at right angles.
As may be expected, to obtain specific distribution with reflec-
tors acting by specular or prismatic reflection, the light source
must be retained in a fixed position relatively to the reflecting
surface. A slight change in this relative position and the change
in the distribution is very great. With reflectors acting by diffuse
reflection only, a similar variation in the relative positions makes
but little and sometimes no difference whatsoever.
The subject of globes needs next to be given consideration.
A device which entirely surrounds the light source gives distri-
bution of the light flux emitted from its outer surface. The prin-
ciples of diffuse reflection are but little different here than in the
case of the reflector. However, only those dispersed rays of the
shattered beam which come through the media are available for
illumination. When these media are dense, the light source is
not discernable, and the entire globe may be regarded as the
source. When such a condition exists, it is at the expense of a
large amount of absorption, and the efficiency is low. If the
media are not dense, the shape of the light source—for example,
an incandescent filament,—is quite clearly distinguishable. This
has been regarded as most inartistic, and justly so, particularly
where the globe is large in dimensions and surrounds a small light
source, the whole being displayed on the top of a pedestal. The
light flux emitted, however, is of nearly equal intensity in all
directions and may be regarded as uncontrolled, since approxi-
mately as much goes into the upper hemisphere as goes into the
lower. Where the globe, however, is of properly arranged
prisms, not only does the shape of the filament disappear, but the
light flux emitted can be sent to the plane of illumination with


51
comparative certainty. Fig. 9 shows two kinds of prisms. The
first are placed within the globe and their curved apices toward
the light source. The dotted lines show how the beams are
broken into rays, giving a diffusing effect at the expense of very
little absorption. It is by the use of the four-sided outer prisms,
however, that the rays are redirected. The bending of the ray
by refraction and the additional turning of it by reflection is
shown graphically. By globes thus equipped with inner and
OUTER
FIGURE 9.
outer prisms, the light may be either closely or broadly distributed.
The shapes of prismatic globes may be various and the prisms
modified in their angular construction accordingly, making the
problem involved in their design become complex. Prismatic
globes, therefore, serve the purpose of both reflector and shade,
and act with efficiency unequalled by any other method where
the light source is entirely enclosed.
The word "shade" must be used advisedly. The word should
convey the idea of an obstruction by which the dazzling bright-
ness of some light sources is diminished. The term should not
be applied where primarily redirection of the light is to be im-
plied. Shades may be artistic in shapes and colors. They may
be merely ornamental and used to produce decorative effects
only. As a class they are wasteful of luminous energy, but from
the aesthetic standpoint are not easily replaced. No restrictions
are placed upon their design or color, except that wherever in-


stalled they should not violate good taste nor fail to harmonize
with surroundings. Some embody both the qualities of reflec-
tion and decoration, but all are comparatively inefficient. Pris-
matic reflectors have been moulded into artistic forms and good
results obtained. The general efficiency of them, however, is
lowered below that of the reflector whose contour is the result
of careful calculation. Fortunately, it is true in the latter in-
stances that the resulting shapes are invariably symmetrical and
therefore usually pleasing to the eye, a peculiarity native to all
scientifically constructed things.
Prismatic globes are constructed by which when both two-
sided and four-sided and diffusing prisms are embodied in a
single type, an irregular distribution is obtainable, and these have
proven wonderfully useful in solving certain problems in illumin-
ation. They are called, because of the unequal distribution, asym-
metrical globes, and the distribution is graphically shown in
the accompanying curves of Fig. 10. So far, no other methods
of light control have accomplished such a distribution.
Satin Finished Prismatic Reflectors—Prismatic reflectors may
have their inner surfaces depolished by acid etching. The effect
of such treatment is to obtain a combination of diffuse and spec-
ular reflection. The general form of the distribution curve of
the reflector is not materially changed by the depolishing if care
in the process of depolishing is exercised. The change in the
curve is, however, noticeable. Distributing reflectors thus treated
lose some of their wide spreading power, while concentrating
types concentrate less and their curves broaden out. If the de-
polishing process is carried too far, the distributor, and concen-
trator both lose their specular reflecting powers and the resulting
distribution curves are characteristic of diffuse reflectors and are
therefore very much alike. Acid etching, or as it is called, Satin
Finish, may be regarded as ornamental. It, however, has a more
important function. The intrinsic brilliancy of the lately devel-
oped light sources—Mazda lamps for instance—is so high that
it is eye fatiguing, and by frosting the bowl of the lamp and de-
polishing the surface of the prismatic reflector, the objectionable
glare vanishes and the light is much more subdued and less
dazzling.

THE MICHIGAN TECHXIC
The application of the globes and reflectors mentioned in this
paper is a subject which invades the field of illumination, or, as
is fast being recognized and named, the field of illuminating en-
gineering. This subject is interminable. Every location presents
its own problems, which may be separately solved. Many of
these problems are similar, such as the lighting of school rooms
in two entirely different buildings. Show windows might be
said in a general way to present similar problems in lighting.
As examples of how distribution and other characterisitcs of
globes, reflectors and shades are applied, the following are sub-
mitted.
Localized Lighting—The long line of sewing machines in a
shoe factory requires light on the needle. A parabolic steel re-
flector surfaced with aluminum, Fig. n, is placed about a lamp,
rated at 16 c. p. in the direction of its maximum natural intensity.
The reflector will increase this to 60 c. p. in the direction of the
needle, while the opaque structure keeps out of range of vision
the source of light.
General Illumination—Fig. 12 shows curve given by a reflector
designed to spread the light broadly. Fig. 13 shows the distrib-
uted unit system of placing these devices about lamps arranged in
squares on the ceiling, with resulting equal intensity of illumina-
tion on the plane below.
Concentrated Illumination—Fig. 14 shows a prismatic reflector
installation by which the light in a show window is directed on
the goods to be displayed with concentrating reflectors like that
shown in Fig. 15, together with its curve of distribution. Note
the dissimilarity between this curve and curve shown in Fig. 12.
Fig. 16 shows one method of lighting a school room with assym-
metrical globes, a cut of one of which appears in Fig. 17, and its
irregular curve of distribution in Fig. 10. The greater part of
the light flux is sent over the scholar's left shoulder, and for this
reason the first row is close to the wall of one side of the room,
while the last row is not so near to the opposite wall. Fig. 19
shows a room lighted from above, the light sources being sur-
rounded by inner and outer prism hemispheres. Under a hemis-
phere such as these, a single tungsten lamp burning in series with
a bent mercurial vapor tube is sometimes used, and the admix-

ture of the two kinds of light flux so different in their color values
is effected. A high efficiency results and the illumination is quite
satisfactory, since the red ray so lacking in the light emitted by
the tube is supplied by the tungsten lamp. Fig. 20 shows the dis-
tribution curve obtained by a tungsten lamp and a flat prismatic
reflector placed above a hemisphere. Fig. 21 shows an art glass
dome used with the G. M. portable stand lamp. The lamps under
the dome are equipped with prismatic globes, and the light there-
by mostly thrown to the plane below, while the light which passes
upward illuminates the dome, bringing out all the colors of the
art glass.
Fig. 22 shows a cluster of incandescent lamps equipped with
reflectors. Fig. 23 shows the distribution of light obtained by
the cluster, which consumes only 360 watts, and the distribution
curve of a 600 watt enclosed arc lamp is superimposed. It is
evident that the cluster distributes more available light flux, not-
withstanding the lesser amount of energy required to produce it.
Fig. 24 is a cut of a special street lighting globe, the asym-
metrical distribution of which solves many difficult problems in
efficient street illumination with incandescent lamps. Fig. 25
shows the distribution obtained with this street lighting globe,
and its application.
Fig. 26 shows two superimposed curves, the first (continuous
line) obtained with a dust covered globe just before washing,
and the second (dotted line) with the same globe cleaned. The
loss of light in the upper hemisphere due to the presence of the
dust is quite marked, while equally apparent is it that the quan-
tity of light in the lower hemisphere is but little changed after
the dust has been removed.
Efficiency—The term "efficiency" is not always specific as
used. By many it is applied only to the amount of light in the
lower hemisphere as compared with the entire flux given off by
the light source. In another sense, efficiency means the total
luminous flux given off by a lamp and its globe or reflector com-
pared with the total luminous flux given off by the same lamp
bared of any light controlling device. Regarding efficiency in
this connection, the shape and material of the media surrounding
the sources play such an important part that only by taking each
case separately can these efficiencies be ascertained. The absorp-

To overcome the objection to the dazzling effect of tungsten
filament lamps, systems of indirect lighting have been recom-
mended and commercially exploited. Such a system is much less
efficient than its predecessor, the direct system. It has features
which are very desirable, notwithstanding. Chief of these is the
keeping of the light source out of line of vision. Since the ab-
sorption factor of a ceiling is all important, very little opportunity-
is presented to use indirect lighting devices with any but a white
ceiling. Even then the increase of energy is 33 1/3% over that
required in direct lighting and many psychological phenomena
enter to make the problem more complex. The distribution of
the light flux is in most cases diffuse, since ceilings are usually of
rough or matted surface.
In conclusion, it is well to look forward to see what may be
anticipated in the way of future development. Globes, reflectors
and shades will all change as the evolution in light sources them-
selves takes place, but with the importance of properly controlling
luminous energy being more and more recognized, it is safe to
predict that the appliances effecting this control will keep abreast
with the other developments and the demand for original designs
in ornamental and scientific devices will grow greater and greater.


DESIGN OF ILLUMINATION WITH PARTICULAR
REFERENCE TO INTERIORS.
H. H. Higuik, E.E., University of Michigan.
The considerations which should influence the design of a
proper system of ilkimination for any assigned purpose, may be
classified as follows, in the order of their importance:
(a) Physiological.
(b) Aesthetic or Artistic.
(c) Economic.
None of these should be sacrificed to the others, although cases
will frequently arise where (c) will be more important than (b).
The science of "Illuminating Engineering" refers more partic-
ularly to the application of principles (a) and (c). There has not
yet developed a class of men who are capable of realizing at
once both the scientific and aesthetic requirements of the prob-
lem of harmonious and efficient lighting; hence, in the present
state of the art, the design of illumination generally necessitates
the co-operation of architect and engineer. Only in special cases
may lighting be planned purely for appearances, disregarding
efficiency and cost; and certainly no installation should be de-
signed without regard to good taste and propriety. The illumin-
ation of a room should never be its dominant feature, except
when the illumination is used for advertising purposes.
This paper is written from the engineering standpoint, and it is
to be understood to dictate merely the basis of the architectural
treatment, the aim of which should be to utilize these necessary
principles in harmony with the structure and with the surround-
ings.
The Engineers' Problem.
CHOOSING THE TYPE OF LAMP.
We shall assume that the superiority of the electric lamp
(which is not debatable in any respect except possibly, in some
locations, operating efficiency or energy cost) cause it to be select-


«d. Of the variety of electric lamps available at present, our
choice will be governed by the size and character of the space to
be lighted, the quality of illumination required, and the cost of
the illumination, including investment and maintenance.
Influence of the Sice of the Space to be Illuminated.
For low interiors, where the height of the lamp above the plane
to be illuminated is limited to say 15 feet, we should use small
light units symmetrically arranged, and rather close together.
Large units widely separated cannot produce uniform illumina-
tion (which is most frequently required) unless hung high up.
Moreover, on account of their distance apart, they create objec-
tionably dense shadows, and by their action as brilliant spots
in the field of vision, are apt to cause even brightly-illuminated
objects to appear dark by comparison. The difference between
small and large low interiors will be only in the number of light
sources used.
For large, lofty interiors, particularly those having few ob-
structions (as columns, beams, iron trusses, etc.), and where a
high quality of illumination is not essential, large units should
be used, hung high and comparatively far apart. Small units
would have to be numerous and arranged in clusters, making
a rather expensive installation.
Open areas, squares, and streets may be illuminated by numer-
ous small sources, close to the ground and relatively close to-
gether, or by fewer large sources, hung high and rather far apart.
The former system is more expensive but produces a much
more uniform illumination, with less light wasted—its use is
almost compulsory in streets where obstructions are numerous
and foliage thick; the latter is more frequently used, however,
particularly where the population is scattered, or business reasons
do not require the adoption of a higher grade of illumination.
Thus our choice of lamps is immediately circumscribed. The
arcs, which are the most efficient light sources yet developed,
cannot operate satisfactorily nor efficiently in small sizes. To a
less extent, this may also be said of vapor lamps. The field
of these is the illumination of large and high interiors, open
spaces, and streets. The filament lamps were developed to


furnish a small and flexible unit adapted to interiors, and, more
particularly, small rooms. Between carbon filaments, Gem,
tantalum, and tungsten lamps, our choice must be determined
by consideration of other conditions discussed hereafter.
The Nernst lamp occupies a rather unique position, being avail-
able in a large range of sizes with fairly uniform efficiency. Its
use is limited principally by the cost of the lamp and the energy.
It is not as efficient as the tungsten filament lamp.
Quality of Illumination Required.
Important qualities in illumination are
Steadiness,
Uniformity,
Color.
Flickering of the light, whether due to lack of constancy in
the light-giving medium or in the operating mechanism, or to
fluctuations in the voltage due to poor design of the circuits or
bad regulation of the generators, is ruinous to the eyes, and
will effectually disqualify any lamp. The arcs arc particularly
subject to this fault, although incandescent lamps are quite sus-
ceptible to variations of voltage, the metallic filaments less so
than carbon filament.
Likewise, a streaked or uneven distribution of light stresses
the eye dangerously. These faults in their most acute form may
be experienced by walking along the shady side of a high picket
fence. If the light from a lamp be inherently uneven, the fault
may be largely corrected (at some sacrifice in efficiency) by the
use of a frosted, etched, sandblasted, or opalescent glass enclos-
ing globe, or by the use of reflectors with satin-finish; any of
these, by diffuse reflection, or by diffraction, redistribute the
light in a more even manner. The unevenness here referred to,
is not that produced purposely in the system of localized illumin-
ation; such unevenness may be not only economical and tasteful,
but also beneficial from a physiological standpoint, due to the op-
portunity it offers of resting the eye, and the possibility of using
lower actual intensities to produce required effects, due to the
decrease of eye fatigue.
Brilliant spots of light should be avoided at all places within


the field of direct vision. It is a disadvantage for any lamp to
produce a high intrinsic brilliancy—that is, to emit a large Mux
of light per unit area. Any image of an object brighter than
five candle-power per square inch of its projected area, will be
injurious to the retina. All commercial lights except the Moore
tube, exceed this figure unless enclosed by diffusing surfaces;
but the trouble is greatest with the arc lamps. The fault may be
corrected, where possible, by placing the light sources out of
direct view, either high above the working plane, or in coves or
hanging basket reflectors as in the indirect system of illumina-
tion. Bright spots are not only injurious, but wasteful, because
they cause the iris of the eye to contract, shutting oft' light pro-
portionally from the less brilliant parts of the image, impairing
the distinction and requiring a higher average illumination for the
required clearness of vision. In other words, things look dim in
comparison with the lamp itself.
The importance of the color of the light will depend upon the
purpose of the illumination, and the color of the surrounding
bodies, which are to be seen by reflected light. For some purposes
a selective emission of certain colors is an advantage for the
lamp, and for other purposes it is prohibitive. Thus, for dwel-
lings a warm color is most suitable—lights having a tinge of red
or yellow; for draughting rooms a pronounced green or bluish
green is permissible, is more economical than white light, and is
actually easier to see by; but for art galleries, stores,' textile
mills, etc., white'light is generally required The question is
complicated by the fact that the sensitivity of the eye for dif-
ferent colors of light varies with the intensity; in faint illumin-
ations, the eye can see better by bluish-green light, whereas in
high illuminations yellowish light is better. In general, where
objects are not to be distinguished as to their colors, the light
will be chosen without regard to color composition, but rather on
the basis of economy. The most efficient lights yet developed are
colored, either yellow or green.
Where it is required simply to distinguish the form of objects
by aid of shades and shadows, or to distinguish lines and figures,
as in foundries, drafting rooms, printing plants, machine shops,
power plants, etc., a more or less monochromatic light may be
used to advantage—as, flaming or luminous arcs, mercury vapor


lamps, or colored vacuum tubes. But where it is important to
distinguish colors, or to see objects as by daylight, a lamp must
be used in which the colors are balanced more nearly as in day-
light—i. e., the whitest and most efficient incandescent lamps—
Gem, tungsten, Xernst, and Moore-tube lamps ( using CO„ gas
in the tube).
Cost to Produce the Required Illumination.
So many variable items enter into a comparison of the various
lamps, as to cost of installation, cost of maintenance, and oper-
ating efficiency, .that it is beyond the scope of this article to dis-
criminate except in a very rough manner. In addition to the cost
per unit of useful light flux, of the lamp with such auxiliary
mechanism and reflecting attachments as may be necessary, there
are involved the cost of repairs and renewals, which depend on
the operating conditions, distribution of the lamps, and cost of
labor; the depreciation, which depends on the rate of advance-
ment of the art, and invention of improved types; and the ex-
pense of installation, which depends on the distribution of the
lamps, nature of the structure or environment, and efficiency of
the lamp. For example, the cost of trimming a given set of
arcs will be greater if they are distributed along the streets,
than if they are grouped in one building, the difference depend-
ing on the cost of labor; and the cost of wiring, fuses, switches,
cut-oifts and generating equipment will be less for tungsten lamps
than for carbon lamps giving the same light flux.
Furthermore, quality rather than cost is becoming the prime
factor in illumination design, and the number of types of lamp
available is not yet extensive enough to leave much choice out-
side the question of fitness for the purpose in view.
In general, the large high-efficiency flaming and luminous arcs
and mercury arc prove to be the least expensive under the con-
ditions which permit use of them, as already explained. Where
smaller units are required, the tungsten filament lamp proves to
be more economical than any other incandescent lamp, whenever
the cost of power is not so low that the saving in energy and re-
newals fails to balance the excess of first cost over other filament
lamps. The cost of power is nearly always in excess of this


69
figure, which is about one cent per k. vv. hour when comparing
tungsten with other filament lamps, and about two cents when
comparing with Nernst lamps.
The Nernst lamp and the white Moore tube have such qualities
that they are usable in almost any design. Both are beautiful
lights, but neither has established itself with the rapidity of the
luminous arcs on the one hand, nor the tungsten incandescents
on the other hand. It appears that each of these lamps is yet
outclassed as to efficiency, if not also cost, but there is reason to
believe that both represent types which may sometime displace
their present competitors.
For data as to costs, the reader is referred to the files of the
"Electrical World and Engineer," which contain an abundance of
the most recent information. The book of M. Solomon on "Elec-
tric Lamps" also contains economic data reduced to such terms
as to be available for ready comparison.
Choosing the System of Distribution of the Light.
After the selection of the lamp, the next step, logically, is the
selection of the system by which the light is to be distributed.
Most types of lamps lend themselves readily to several methods
of treatment in application, which may be classified as follows:
Illumination from Points or Small Surfaces.
This is the most usual method, the light sources being so small,
or the space so large, that they may be treated as points in the
calculation of the illumination. Of course, the direct light de-
livered by these sources at any given place is supplemented to a
greater or less extent by diffuse reflection from adjacent sur-
faces, depending upon the nature and distribution of these sur-
faces and the distribution of light from the source. The lights
are usually mounted close to the ceiling, but may be suspended
in clusters; and auxiliary lamps may be placed along the side
walls.
This system is the most flexible for general purposes, being
susceptible of great variety in treatment to produce either uniform


or localized illumination, with maximum economy, at least for
small and moderate sized interiors. This system is frequently
misused, however. Difficulty is apt to be experienced with
shadows, inasmuch as each point source tends to cast a distinct
shadow, and these shadows conflict.
Illumination from Lines or Tubes.
This system, first commercialized by McFarlan Moore, is best
suited to large interiors, and, particularly, those whose ceilings are
not lofty. Small tubes are not efficient, and the light it not sub-
divided, so that the whole tube, which is frequently 200. feet long,
must be used at once. This puts it out of the question for small
interiors, such as dwellings.
The tube may be arranged in any convenient geometrical form,
suspended from the ceiling in short lengths on hangers like pipe,
and welded together in place by portable blowpipe. The light
distribution may be made as good as that of any other system.
One very important advantage is that it may be arranged exactly
as desired, without limitation as to wiring or fixtures and without
sacrifice of appearances, which gives it a peculiar field in illumin-
ating old and unwired buildings. Efficient reflectors are of course
a necessary adjunct, since more than half of the light, emanating
upward, would otherwise become useful only after inefficient
reflection from wall sufaces. Any tube source has the further
advantage that shadows are not as sharp nor pronounced as
with other lights of equal power but higher concentration.
Illumination from Large Surfaces.
For uniformity of illumination, elimination of objectionable
shadows and high-lights, and general simulation of daylight
effects, this system is the best. It is seriously handicapped, how-
ever, by poor efficiency. With the exception of the luminous
tubes, all light sources are practically points, and their light must
be reflected by the surface, which is usually the ceiling. The
lights are cither arranged in coves along the sidewalls near the
ceiling, out of view from the floor, or suspended in inverted
basket reflectors, by which their light is thrown first to the ceiling.
Thus, before reaching the working plane, most of the light under-


goes at least two reflections from surfaces which are inherently
poor reflectors, and likely to deteriorate rapidly, due to age and
accumulation of dirt. The lights themselves, too, are in a
position to accumulate dust most easily. The ceiling finish is
necessarily white or light yellow, and undecorated. Of the colors,
cream is best, though absorbing 40.% of the light.
Although this system gives satisfaction in many classes of in-
teriors, the author considers that its proper field is limited to
general illumination. He considers that the absence of shadow
is objectionable for all other purposes; that a higher illumination
of the ceiling than of the working plane is an inversion of custom
which is, initially at least, disagreeable; that the absence of direc-
tion in the light is trying to the eyes; and that the system is not
adapted to brilliant yet efficient illumination of the floor or work-
ing plane. The absence of shadow or direction may be overcome,
of course, by adding a few units whose effect is direct. It is
true, also, that on account of the absence of brilliant spots, the
same subjective effects may be produced with an objective illum-
ination lower than would be required by the direct lighting sys-
tem, hence the disadvantage as to efficiency may not be as great
as would appear from the absorption of the reflecting surfaces.
This system has gained favor only in certain sections of the
country, and in locations where well-diffused light is considered
essential.
With any of these systems, w:e have a choice of two methods
of distributing the light, as follows:
Uniform Illumination Over the Entire Illuminated Plane.
Low Uniform General Illumination, Supplemented by a High
Localized Illumination at the Points Where Work is to be Done.
The former is adopted where the object is merely to make
movement or traffic safe—as in corridors and streets, in which
case the intensity is low; or to illuminate an area on which the
working spots are very numerous or shifting, as in offices, draft-
ing rooms, foundries, schoolrooms, railroad stations, auditoriums,
etc., in which cases the intensity is high, and the system is very
expensive.
The latter is adopted where physiological, economic, or aesthetic


considerations indicate that, a uniform high intensity would be
monotonous or tiresome to the eye, or prohibitively expensive,
and yet a very intense light is required at known locations, or in
variable direction and under control of a workman. This system
is used in residences, desks, libraries, mills, machine shops, etc.
Choosing the Intensity of Illumination.
Next, we must settle upon the intensity of illumination neces-
sary at the working plane. In general it may be said that the
intensity in foot-candles at the working plane must be above a
rather indefinite minimum (depending upon the purpose of the
illumination, the color and surface of the objects to be viewed by
the reflected light, and the eyesight of the average individual who
is to use the illumination), and must not exceed a certain maxi-
mum, also indefinite, and depending upon the individual. Beyond
either of these limits, eye injury will result—injury which is all
the more dangerous because, on account of the wonderful flexi-
bility of the eye, it may be unconscious and insidious.
There is also an economical upper limit; because, as the inten-
sity of illumination is increased, the pupil contracts to shut out
an excess of light and the eye becomes less sensitive, so that the
effect of any increment becomes less as the actual illumination
becomes higher, and beyond a certain point the increment is
practically wasted. It is a common observation that the eye
can hardly perceive increases in the brightness of objects, after
a certain degree of brightness has been exceeded.
Between these limits there is a rather wide range of values
to choose from, and, necessarily, not very conclusive data to
guide. It is a matter of judgment and experience in each par-
ticular case, depending upon the work to be done, the environ-
ment, the degree of distinction required, and, more than anything
else, the disposition and previous light-education of the users.
There is a continual upward trend in the light intensities that we
consider to be desirable, which tendency is probably more harm-
ful than necessary. The injury is cumulative, also; because at high
intensities the eye becoming less sensitive and more fatigued, de-
mands a still higher intensity to perform its functions. In any
design, the intensity chosen should be the lowest consistent with


73
satisfactory vision without fatigue; it is easier to increase it sub-
sequently, than to decrease it.
Some data have been collected from measurements of actual
installations considered to be satisfactory, representative examples
of which are quoted herewith:

Calculation of the Quantity, or Flux, of Light to be De-
livered at the Working Plane.
One lumen of light flux will produce a uniform flux density,
or intensity of illumination, of one foot-candle, over an area of
one square foot, or an intensity of one meter-candle over an area
of one square meter. A mean spherical candle is a total light
flux of 4 -it or 12.57 lumens.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Therefore, we obtain the total effective flux of light, in lumens,
by multiplying the area to be lighted (square feet) by the desired
intensity (foot-candles) ; or in mean spherical candles, by divid-
ing the lumens by 12.57.
Selection of the Photometric Curve of the Light Source
or Type of Reflector.
The Spacing and Grouping of the Lamps.
The spacing and height of the light units are intimately related
to the photometric curve; the number and grouping are depend-
ant upon the total light flux required for the illumination, the
effective flux per lamp, and the spacing of the units. Consequently
it is impossible to discuss these considerations separately; they
are arranged as above, merely for convenience.
The total light flux which must issue from the lamps, to pro-
duce the required effective lumens on the working plane, will
depend:
(a). Upon how much of the light is directed toward the plane,
and how much is projected toward other surfaces from which
it must be reflected before reaching the working plane—i. e., upon
the photometric curve of the lighting unit.
(b). Upon the reflecting efficiency of the ceiling and walls,
and other adjacent surfaces, from which light is reflected to the
working plane.
The influence of the indirect component upon the total illumin-
ation at any given point will depend upon the location of that
point and of the light sources, with respect to the reflecting sur-
faces, as well as upon the size of the room, and color, finish, and
condition of these surfaces. Data on this point are meagre in
the present state of the art. A series of tests, reported by Lan-
singh and Rolph, "Transactions Ilium. Eng. Soc.," Oct. 1908, indi-
cates that the illumination may be increased 150.% by using light
ceiling and walls, rather than dark. This is an extreme case.
If the proper photometric curves or reflectors are selected for the
light units, the influence of the diffusely reflected light, in all but
the smallest rooms, will be so reduced that it may be disregarded
in the calculations, on account of the possibility of changes and


75
deterioration in the finish and decorations, decrease in the light
flux of the lamp on account of age and the accumulation of dirt
and dust, and probable fluctuations in voltage. A well selected
reflector or photometric curve will allow only enough light in the
unused parts of the room, to produce an agreeable general ap-
pearance.
It is not difficult to deduce the equation of a photometric curve
for a single lamp, or one of a group of lamps, the number and
geometrical configuration or distribution of which are specified,
such that the single lamp, or the group, will produce any desired
distribution of light flux on a given working plane. There is a
multitude of possible combinations, which may be reduced to a
few typical ones, for practical purposes:
(a). Uniform illumination of a limited area by a single lamp
or lighting unit.
(b). Uniform illumination of an unlimited area by the com-
bined effects of a multitude of lamps or units.
The case of non-uniform or localized illumination (which
might have been designated (c)) may be treated as a combination
of these, or superposition of one on the other; or in special cases,
as the lighting of reading-tables in a library, the light may be
allowed purposely to shade away within the working area, to
allow adjustment of position to suit various eyes.
The light distribution of a source is usually, and properly, uni-
form in a plane perpendicular to the axis of suspension, hence
its isolux lines, or lines of equal illumination, on a horizontal
working plane, are circles. The area that can be illuminated
uniformly by a single source is circular, and limited by the useful
light flux of the lamp. The form of photometric curve theoreti-
cally required to illuminate uniformly a given circular area will
vary with the height of the lamp above the working plane. (See
Fig. 2). A light-distributing device may be designed to produce
a photometric curve closely approximating the theoretical within
a limited angle—that is, to produce a uniform distribution over a
circular area whose diameter bears a definite ratio to the height of
suspension. The number of designs must be limited, of course,
but the diameter of the circle could be indefinitely extended, for
any required illumination intensity, by using larger units or a
group of units, of the same type, suspended higher up. In in-


teriors, therefore, the dimensions of a room which may be illum-
inated uniformly by a single source or fixture (lamp or cluster),
are limited by the height of the ceiling. Usually, the angle at
the apex of the cone whose base is uniformly illuminated by com-
mercial sources, is between 60. and 80. degrees, or 30-40 degrees
either side of the axis of the lamp, or normal to the illuminated
surface; in some arc lamps, this angle is as great as 120. degrees.
Consequently, the greatest diameter (d™") of a room or space
which is to be illuminated by a single source, must not exceed
(2 h tan o) where a, as denned above, is really the angle within
which the actual photometric curve coincides with the theoretical
curve pertaining to the ratio d/h, and h is the height of the center
of illumination above the working plane. If o is 30. degrees, then
d"»«x=i.i6h, and if 0 = 40°, then d»«=i.68h.
If the room is small compared with the height, the same rela-
tion may be used universely to determine the proper height of
suspension for the lamp; if 0 = 30°, h = .862d"«, and if
0 = 40°, h = .595d'»". These are limiting values, because it
is usually permissible, or even desirable, to shade off the light at
the sides of the room, consequently the lights may be hung lower,
producing a higher illumination beneath the lamp, and scattering
less.
This type of photometric curve is designated "Extensive" or
"Distributing;" and in the Holophane class, which is most scien-
tifically designed, the general rule for the E reflector or curve is
to place the (single) light source one-third to one-half times as
high above the plane of illumination, as the mean of the length
and width of the room. If the ceiling height will not permit this,
then the room is too large for a single source, and must be illum-
inated by the combined action of a number of sources.
When a number of sources are used, they are naturally ar-
ranged symmetrically,— that is, in a single line along the middle
of a corridor or narrow room, or at the centers of squares in the
case of a large room where more than one row is required. The
large room is a separate problem requiring a different form of
photometric curve; the single row of lights, or corridor, is treated
usually as a variation of case (a), using the E or distributing
curve. We shall consider the large room, therefore.
In this case, any point in the room receives an appreciable


77
share of its illumination from four or more sources or fixtures.
It is possible to deduce a large number of photometric curves
which, theoretically, will blend their light so as to produce a
uniform illumination over the entire plane. For a further dis-
cussion of this subject, reference must be had to other treatises
(Articles by A. A. Wohlauer, Elect. World, 1907-1908—and
Elect. Ilium. Engineering, Barrows, pages 184-190).
In general, however, it may be said that, although the exact
form of the curve depends upon the ratio
distance between units
k =
height of suspension
becoming broader and flatter as this ratio increases, yet the gen-
eral shape of these curves is such as to throw more of the light
directly beneath the lamp, and less of it away from the lamp, than
in the case of the E curve. To this type, accordingly, is given
the name "Intensive" or "Concentrating." (See Figs. 4 and 5).
Again, as in case (a), it is impracticable to manufacture dis-
tributing devices to approximate more than a few of these theo-
retical curves. The designers have selected a reasonable ratio
(d/h), and modeled therefor a line of reflectors for lamps of
various sizes; these are applied to any given room by choosing
(h) as large as the ceilings will allow, or as large as practicable
from other considerations, and then adjusting (d), and the
number of lamps, in accordance with the ratio pertaining to the
curve of the light unit. The size of the lamps, or number of
lamps per outlet, will depend upon the intensity of illumination
required at the working plane.
The Holophane Intensive curve is designed for a ratio
d/h = 5/4, or inversely, they are suspended above the working
plane by a distance equal to 4/5 of their distance apart. If a
unit be used whose curve has not been standardized, or for which
the ratio (d/h) is not known or given, this may be found by
comparing with theoretical curves for various ratios, or by ad-
justing the lamp locations until the illumination, as figured by
the analytical method (to be hereafter described) proves to be
uniform.
Now, although the intensive curve is suited to large areas and


numerous light sources, and the extensive curve to small areas
with a single source, it is not prohibitive to use one in the province
of the other. And, in general, for any type of photometric
curve there is a certain minimum height of suspension corres-
ponding to a given spacing, or a certain maximum spacing cor-
responding to a given height, which limits cannot be passed with-
out making the illumination distinctly non-uniform; but the
lamps may be hung higher or closer together than this without
greatly impairing the uniformity. The difficulty is only in the
waste of light involved; an E reflector hung too high in a room
of small dimensions, or even I reflectors suspended very high,
will throw an unnecessarily large share of light upon the walls,
from which it must be reflected at great sacrifice to become use-
ful. The larger the area, or the more remote the bounding sur-
faces, the less valid is this objection; and for an indefinitely large
area, with very high suspension and sources reasonably close
together, the exact form of the curve would be unimportant,
provided no light were shed in the upper hemisphere. This will
be clearer after a consideration of the flux of light method.
For interiors with extremely high ceilings, and where it is ad-
visable to avoid a long suspension for the lamp, it is necessary
to use a still more concentrating reflector, designated "Focusing"
or F type, which will produce a uniform illumination over a
circle whose diameter is (h/2), from a single unit, or from a
multitude of units d = 3/4.11. The practise of the Holophane
Company has been quoted as standard, merely because this com-
pany was the first to make scientifically-designed light-controlling
devices.
Not many types of lamp possess, inherently, a photometric
curve suited to the cases in which their other properties entitle
them to consideration; the magnetite lamp for street lighting may
be used without reflecting devices, but the tungsten filament
lamp is worse than the carbon lamp, if used without a reflector.
Therefore, since reflectors are necessary adjuncts to most lamps,
the problem of correct and economical illumination depends large-
ly on correct design of the reflecting surfaces.
Other types of reflectors, globes, and shades are made, with
special curves to suit side wall brackets, schoolrooms, show win-
dows, streets and the requirements of other situations which can-
not be detailed within the limits of this article.


Calculation of the Number and Size of Light
Units Required.
Two methods of calculating the number and size of light units
required to illuminate a given area to a given intensity, will be
explained; the first as a working method, the second as a check.
The so-called Flux-of-Light-Method suggested by Dr. C. H.
Sharp and elaborated by Cravath and Lansingh in a paper before
the I. E. S., Oct. 1908, is applicable to all cases, which gives it
a decided advantage in the treatment of light sources whose
photometric curves are extremely irregular or unsymmetrical.
Its application is easy and rapid, also, for any system of light
distribution, whether by points, tubes, or surfaces; in some cases
it is the only practicable method. It is most accurate in cal-
culating large interiors with many sources of light, of low power,
closely spaced, and is not so good for small interiors with sources
of high candle power and uneven distribution.
The ratio between total and useful light depends upon a num-
ber of things, as explained under E. By analysis of the results
of tests and data from a large number of installations of various
kinds, Cravath and Lansingh determined for various types of
rooms, the value of the angle within which the light flux could
be considered useful, and beyond which the light flux would be
wasted by absorption and reflections.
In a small room of ordinary height, with very dark walls, and
lamps placed near the ceiling, the zone of useful light would not
extend beyond 50. to 60. .degrees either side of the vertical, the
aid from reflection by walls being negligible.
In a very large room with few obstructions and light colored
walls, the zone of useful light is much wider, and each point on
the working plane receives light from many lamps.
For light walls or large rooms, the useful zone is approximately
75. degrees; for dark walls or small rooms it is about 60. degrees;
for small rooms with certain reflectors, it may be only 45.°. For
conservative estimates, the 60.° zone should usually be taken.
From the photometric curve of the lighting unit selected from
previous considerations, determine the mean candle power within
the useful zone. This may be done by a Rousseau diagram, but
an equivalent method, more easily applied, is to read off the candle


power from the curve at certain calculated angles, and take the
arithmetical average.

Multiply the mean candle power thus determined for the
effective or useful zone, by a "Flux-factor" from the following
table; the product is the number of lumens of light flux within
that zone. The flux-factor is simply the number of units of solid
angle subtended by the given zone. One lumen of light flux
will fill a unit solid angle with an intensity or conical flux density
of one mean candle power.

If now we divide the total lumens required at the working
plane, by the useful lumens per lamp or unit, we shall have the
number of units required. Of course, to save expense on fix-
tures, lamps, and reflecting equipment, it is desirable to choose
the unit as large as can be had of the desired type; yet the total
number required must be as nearly as possible a multiple of the
number of outlets, as determined by the dimensions of the space


to be lighted and the spacing. There must, of course, be an in-
tegral number of lamps per outlet or fixture.
A rough method which may sometimes be used, with discre-
tion, is to calculate the tip candle power required, and to choose
the size of unit giving the lowest and nearest multiple thereof.
From this, and the total number of units required as calculated
above, the number of outlets is determined, and these are so
spaced as to come at the centers of squares. The tip candle
power is approximately equal to the foot candles intensity re-
quired at the working plane, multiplied by the square of the height
of suspension (h2).
. A more direct method of calculating the size and number of
units, which is based on measurements of existing installations
and checks with the flux-of-light method as outlined above, is
to multiply the area to be illuminated by the watts per square foot
required to produce the desired illumination under the given con-
ditions. This gives the total watts which must be expended to
produce the required useful light flux with the chosen lamps; it
must be divided into units and spaced as already explained.

The Analytical or Point-to-point Method for
Calculating Illumination.
This method is useful as a means of examining theoretically the
light distribution within a given space, produced by sources whose
positions in the space are known. It is very useful to apply it
to a design which has been worked out by the methods already
explained; if the distribution is not suitable, this method indi-
cates what changes—of size or of photometric curve of lighting
unit, or location or height of units, are necessary to produce the
desired results. It is therefore a valuable auxiliary to good de-
sign, being a check on the thumb rules which are essential to
commercially rapid methods.
By "illumination" we refer to the light flux density, or sectional
intensity, at the working plane. We refer to the incident light
and not to the reflected light by which objects are seen. Illumina-
tion is expressed in terms of foot-candles. A foot-candle is the
flux density at a distance of one foot from a source whose conical
intensity is one candle-power, or one lumen per unit solid angle.
When a point receives light from more than one source, the total
illumination at that point is the sum of flux densities due to all
the sources.
In Fig. (1) let
L = Center of illumination or source of light, whose photometric curve
is as shown.
A P = Working plane.
h = Height of suspension above A P.
P = Point at which illumination is to be calculated.
r = Distance from P to foot of perpendicular or normal to working plane,
from L.
C = Candle power in direction of point P.
I = Distance from P to L = V/i=-(- r"
Then
Flux-density at P in plane normal to ray = C/f (ft. candles.)
The flux impinging upon a small area ds normal to the ray L P
at P, is {C/1-) ds. Obviously, since this same flux is distributed


over the area ds' in the plane A P, it follows that the flux den-
sity at P in the plane A P, is (C ds/l-) -j- ds'.
But ds/ds' = cos a, hence
Horizontal illumination at P = C cos a/p
(Plane AP).
Similarly, it may be shown that
Vertical illumination at P = C sin a/P
(Plane BP).
The plane to be illuminated is generally horizontal; the vertical
illumination is calculated for vertical surfaces in such places as
art galleries, bookstacks in libraries, etc. Since it is more usual
to know two of the quantities h, r, a, a more convenient form of
these equations is:
H = Horiz. ilium, at P = C cos'a/lf.
V = Vertical ilium, at P = C cos3 o. sin a/tf.
a = tan"1 (r/h).
In Bulletin 7B of the Eng. Dept. of the N. E. Lamp Assn.
will be found several tables which will facilitate these computa-
tions. The bulletins are sent free on request. In one of these
tables, the values of a and of H' and V are given for a source
of one candle power, for as large a range of values of h and r
as is usually met in practise. This may readily be applied to any
light source whose photometric curve is known, by finding thereon
the value of C corresponding to a, and multiplying this by H'or
V as taken from the table.
In other tables, values of H and V are given, all worked out
for various values of h and r using light sources of various
standard types and sizes. Thus, we may read off directly the
horiz. illumination at a point distant 5. feet (r = 5.) from the
foot of the normal through the lamp, which is a 60. watt tungsten
with E reflector, suspended 11 feet above the working plane
(A =11.). This value is 0.35 foot-candles.
The illuminations so determined refer of course only to the di-
rect light; the additional diffused light coming from the walls,
ceiling, and other objects can merely be estimated in a rough
manner (See Steinmetz-Radiation, Eight and Illumination, pages
246-251). As already explained, this indirect component will
usually be of minor importance, except in the indirect system of
illumination, and in very small rooms.
After the size, height and distance between lamps, and their


photometric curves, have been determined by the flux of light
method, or by simple rules based on the theory already explained
(such rules as published by the Holophane Company in its
Bulletin No. 25, for use in applying its reflectors), a number of
representative points or stations should be chosen in the plan of
the illuminated area, and the illumination worked out by the
analytic method. From these values illumination curves are
drawn, as shown in Figures (3) and (5); from these curves the
excellence of the illumination may be judged with fair accuracy,
and changes may be arranged where necessary.
Synopsis of Design".
1. Select a lamp or light unit (lamp with redistributing de-
vice) which
(a) Gives a suitable quality of light (color, steadiness).
(b) Will work properly on the E. m. f. available.
(c) May be obtained in sizes suited to the area to be lighted,
so as not to produce too intense an illumination, or objectionable
shadows.
(d) Has a photometric curve suited to the problem.
2. Determine the constant D/H for this unit, if this has not
been given by the manufacturers of the unit or determined (as
is best) by experience with and measurements upon actual in-
stallations of this unit. Assume the units to be suspended above
the working plane approximately the maximum value (/!■»)
which will be possible with the given ceiling height. Draw the
curve of horizontal illumination for one unit. Assume two such
units to be placed a distance (If") apart and, by aid of a dividers,
find the curve of resultant illumination. To be more accurate,
four or eight sources ought to be considered in finding this result-
ant curve; but in general it may be said that the greater the num-
ber of light sources, the more uniform the illumination, so that if
it be made fairly uniform considering only two, it will almost cer-
tainly be satisfactory where a larger number of units is used.
Then select another value of D equal to 0.75 h», and draw-
curve of resultant E»; then another for D= 1.25/11., etc., etc.
The resultant illumination curve will be more or less flat depend-
ing upon value of ratio d/h. Choose the largest avlue of d/h
which is possible, without making the maximum ordinate of the


curve exceed the minimum ordinate by, say, 30.%; a multitude
of light sources spaced according to this ratio will give a degree
of uniformity satisfactory to the eye. This ratio d/h is simply
the limiting value not to be exceeded.
3. From the dimensions of the room, determine the number
of outlets of fixtures required. Assume h as large as possible,
and calculate d™ (=d/h X hm)- Divide the length and breadth
of the room by d™, and get the number of rows required each
way. Divide the room into a number of squares equal to the
product of the numbers of rows, and place an outlet at middle of
each square. The unit areas may have to be slightly rectangular
instead of square, in order to make an integral number of rows
each way, or in order to accomodate them to bays, beams, panels,
partitions, windows, or other architectural restrictions. Often,
the boundary rows of outlets are placed closer to the walls than
half the distance between rows, particularly where desks without
individual lights are ranged along the walls, as in many offices.
Edge lamps three feet from wall, is a good rule; all other lamps
equidistant from each other.
In this connection, the shadow difficulty must be considered.
The influences and requirements are so variable, vague, and
complex, that it will probably never be possible to determine a
spacing ratio for proper shadow effects, with even the accuracy
attained in the uniformity ratio. A table of desirable spacings
is given below, taken from a paper by T. W. Rolph in the Elec-
tric Journal, May 1910. This table cannot be strictly adhered
to in all cases, but is far better than a guess. It is better not to
use the largest size square corresponding to the smallest ceiling
height. Smaller squares tend to less distinct shadows as well as
to greater uniformity of illumination.

4. Determine the total useful light flux required to illumin-
ate the room, having selected an intensity suited to the purpose
in view.
5. Determine the useful light flux delivered to the working
plane, per watt supplied to the light unit selected. This may be
done from the photometric curve by assuming a useful angle,
or by dividing the actual measured light flux in an installation of
similar nature (as to size of room, height, wall finish, type of
light unit, etc.), by the watts used in that installation. Both
methods are outlined. This value is called the useful lumens per
7catt. It is the reciprocal of the watts per square foot per foot
candle, of which a tabulation for various conditions has been
given.
6. Divide total useful lumens required by the useful lumens per
watt, and get the total watts required. Or, multiply the required
average foot candles by the watts per lumen (given in the table)
by the area of the room, to get total watts.
7. Divide total watts by total number of outlets, and choose
the size of lamp which comes nearest to this number of watts
per outlet. If no one lamp of the selected type is large enough
(improbable, with units as flexible as now manufactured in all
types), more than one per outlet is necessary, and a fixture must
be used. It may be desirable to use a number of smaller lamps
instead of a single large one.
8. Draw the wiring plans, showing the following:
(a) Location of each outlet in the room.
(b) Which outlets are to be connected together or grouped.
(c) Where the switch controlling each group is to be located,
and what kind of a switch it is to be: i. e., a '"two-point switch*'
for simply turning on or off a group from a single station, a
"three-point switch" for controlling the same lamps from two
stations, etc.
(d) The distributing centers or panels on which are located
the cut-outs and fuses for each circuit.
(e) The path and size of feeding wires from the various dis-
tributing panels to the service point, meter, or main switchboard.
The plans should be accompanied by a sheet of specifications—
conveniently in tabular form, stating definitely the following:
(f) The kind of fixture at each outlet.


(g) The number, size, and type of lamps in each outlet.
(h) The kind of glassware or redistributing devices necessary
at each outlet—as "Holophane I reflectors, clear," or "6-inch
blue alabaster ball," etc.
(i) The height of the lamps (center) above the floor, at each
outlet.
There are a great many practical considerations involved in
the placing and grouping of light units, arrangement and speci-
fication of wiring, etc., which cannot be touched in this paper.
The student is referred to the electrical handbooks; to texts on
wiring (as, Poole's Wiring Handbook, etc.); to the rules of the
Natural Board of Fire Underwriters (called the N. E. C).
Useful Data for Various Lamps and Systems.
Tungsten or Mazda Lamps.
These are very flexible, being available for either series or
multiple operation, with D. C. or A. C, in a wide range of sizes
and all standard voltages. All incandescent lamps are now marked
with a rated wattage and three voltages. The top voltage is the
highest at which it is advisable to operate the lamp, since above
this point the decrease in life overbalance the decrease in energy
cost, and the total maintenance cost increases. At the lower
voltages, efficiency is sacrificed to lengthen the life; a lamp is
burned at bottom voltage only when the cost of energy is very
low compared with the cost of renewals, or when the voltage is
subject to severe fluctuations.
The following data is abstracted from the bulletins of the
National Electric Lamp Ass'n, and is reliable. The prices are
based on a fairly liberal quantity discount—20.%.
The distribution of the light is inherently bad, nearly half
being in the upper hemisphere. Some kind of reflector is es-
sential, which reduces the light by at least 15. to 30.%. Any
desired distribution may be obtained by proper choice or design
of reflector. Of the 85.% of generated light which remains after
passing the reflector, generally about 60.% reaches the working
plane, giving a value of 0.6 X 0.85 X 8.30 = 4.2 useful lumens
per watt for the ordinary sizes of lamp (40. to 100. watts).
The color is more nearly "white" than that of any incandescent


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
filament lamp, with the possible exception of the Nernst lamp.
Compared with the white Moore tube, or with the carbon arc,
however, it is decidedly yellow.
It is essential to buy the correct size of reflector, and the proper
holder, for each size of lamp; misplacement of lamp in reflector
causes marked changes in light-distribution and lowers the effi-
ciency.
Tungsten lamps of the best manufacture are now far more
hardy than those manufactured a few years ago; it is not yet as
dependable under severe mechanical stresses as the tantalum or
carbon lamps, but with fairly careful handling, breakages do not
exceed Yi to i.%. The wire drawn type—the latest development,
may safely be burned in any position.

Nernst Lamps.
Very flexible; may be had for D. C. or A. C. (same lamp in
either case, difference only in glower), no. volts or 220. volts,
and sizes from 50. mean hemispherical c.p. (maximum c.p. from
tip = 74.) to 506. m.h.s.c.p. (745 c.p. max.) These values are
for lamps equipped with clear glass globes.
Almost invariably the lamps are equipped with blue alabaster
globes, which absorb about 30.% of the light, at the same time
diffusing it beautifully and rendering it "mellow" in tone. With-
out such globes the light is glaring and shadows troublesome.

The normal and guaranteed average life of a glower is 600.
hours on D. C. or 800. hours on A. C, provided the voltage fluct-
uation does not exceed 5.% above or below that for which the
glowers are rated. In the table given above, it is assumed that
the glowers of a multiple glower lamp will all be replaced at once,
independent of the heater. The net cost of separate glower is
25 cents. Heaters have a normal guaranteed life of 3000. hrs.
The heater is included with the glower renewal, in single-glower
lamps. For 2-glovver or 3-glower lamps, the net cost of a new
heater is 55 cents, and for 4-glower lamps, 90 cents. All prices
are net F. O. B. Pittsburgh (Westinghouse Nernst Lamp Co.
factory), and are based on an order for 100 lamps. The life of a
ballast tube is guaranteed 15000. hours, and the renewal cost is
58 cents net, and each glower requires a separate ballast.
The color of the Nernst light depends on the globe used: with
bare glower, a bluish white; with alabaster glassware, a mellow
white light. It is a very steady light.


flaming Arc Lamps.
These are available in only a few sizes, and are therefore not
flexible. May be had with vertical or inclined electrodes. Usually
worked at high current densities—about 10. amperes. Can be
had for either D. C. or A. C. All types except the "Regenerative
arc," which is enclosed, must have good ventilation, as fumes are
given off. Diffusing globes are essential, as the arc is far too
brilliant to be viewed. This glassware cuts off a great deal of the
light—30. to 60.%. Same lamp may produce white, yellow, or
pink light, depending on impregnation of carbons. Carbons
come in different lengths, to burn 10, 14, or 18 hours. Magazine
types burn up to 200 hours per trim. There are many makes and
designs of name arc, but the following may be accepted as con-
servative figures:
D. C. flame arcs, 10. amp., 55. volts terminal, 550. watts, 1375.
mean hemispherical candle power, or 0.40 watts per mean h.s.c.p.
A. C. flame arcs, 10. amps., 55. volts, 467. watts, 0.85 power
factor, 850. mean h.s.c.p., or 0.55 watts per mean h.s.c.p.
These figures are for ordinary yellow flame arcs, equipped with
opal globes. With white-light electrodes, the same power yields
30.% less light. With clear, clean globes, the efficiency may be
as high as 0.15 watt per mean h.s.c.p.
Whether the electrodes are vertical or inclined affects the light
distribution but not the efficiency. The former gives an extensive
distribution, with maximum candle power about 25 degrees be-
low the horizontal. This is suited to wide spacing of lamps, as in
streets. The latter gives intensive distribution of light, maximum
candle power being vertically downward; unsuited to street light-
ing—used for large interiors.
The cost of a small size (10 hour) 10 ampere lamp is from
$35.00 to $57.00 depending upon the make and the quantity. A
fair average would perhaps be $45.00.
The renewals (carbons) vary in price with length (life), kind
of current, and manufacture. For D. C. or A. C. 10 hour size,
about 14 cents per pair is a usual price for the best makes, and
about 19 cents per pair for 18 hour size, although some may be
had at 10 cents and 14 cents, respectively.


Cooper-Hewitt Mercury Arcs.
This lamp may be had in a variety of sizes, for D. C. or A. C.
The color is decidedly blue-green, but the light is very steady.
It is used in assembly and erecting rooms, blue printing and
photographic establishments, cement mills, drafting rooms, found-
ries, forge shops, machine shops, postoffices, piers, power plants,
printing plants, rolling mills, warehouses, etc.; in fact, anywhere
that a fairly large light source with low maintenance cost is de-
sired, and color is no object. Its efficiency is not as high as that
of the flame arcs, but higher than other light sources. It is made
in the following types and sizes:
Type K, for D. C. only.
Singly on no. volts, two in series on 220. volts, etc.
Total watts. 385 per lamp.
Mean hemispherical candle power = 700. .
Watts per mean h.s.c.p. =0.55.
Price, each, $38.00; new tube, $14.00.

Light distribution favorable to interiors; maximum candle

Moore Tube Light.
Any length of tube may be had, but standard lengths are 66.
ft. and 114. ft.; standard prices are $350. and $400. respectively,
installed near factory (Newark, N. J.) For installation at dis-
tance, must add expenses of transportation and mechanics to
install.
Tubes can be installed in any desired form from straight runs
to hairpin form with only six inches between centers. In the
average room, tube is kept close to the ceiling, and over large
areas the tubes are spaced so that the distance between centers is
twice the distance of center from floor—i. e.,
D (centers) = 2.0
H (floor)
The Moore light may be any color, depending upon the kind
of gas used in the tube; the most usual colors are Yellow (using
air or nitrogen), White (using CO„), and Pink (using hydrogen).
The vellow is most efficient, but the white is most valuable. Col-


93
ors are seen by this light almost exactly as by average daylight;
on account of the variable color composition of daylight (depend-
ing on time of day, weather, atmospheric clarity or environment,
season, etc.), and the constancy of the white Moore tube, it is
adopted largely as a color standard in all establishments where
discernment of colors is essential—as, for instance, mills for the
manufacture of silks, woolens, carpets, etc., dyeing establish-
ments, glove, hosiery, leather establihments, wall paper factor-
ies, lithography, jewelry shops, art galleries and shops, photog-
raphy, florist shops, millinery, and dry goods stores. In many
cases the working hours of such industries have been extended
by adoption of Moore tube, resulting in increased capacity and.
profit.
The efficiency of the Moore light, even with tubes as long as
176 ft. is relatively low. A yellow tube of this length gave the
following test results:
Watts per mean spherical candle power 2.49.
Total lumens = 17400., total watts = 3451.
Power factor = 73.%. Of the total lumens produced by the
tube, 41.2% were effective on the plane of illumination.
The Moore light requires alternating current. The light alter-
nates with the current—i. e., lights up and goes out for each half
cycle. It is very troublesome to view moving abjects by this
light, since they produce a series of adjacent images unless two
or more tubes fed by polyphase circuits, are used. Tubes are
operated at high voltage (depending on length), obtained by
transformer, which may be wound to take power at any available
voltage. The life of the tubes is not definite—something between
1000. and 5000. hours, the tube gradually blackening.
Additional rules for installation of Moore tubes may bee found
in the Electrical World, Vol. LIV, pages 718-721.
The luminosity of any tube may be controlled over a wide
range by adjusting the voltage, but the efficiency reaches a maxi-
mum at a certain voltage and gas pressure, at which the tube is
operated, by aid of a very delicate automatic gas valve. This
form of light consists only of a tube and a terminal box, the latter
fed by two wires. It is extremely simple, and very adaptable.
The author believes it to be the forerunner of the "light of the
future."

Indirect Illumination.
This system is acknowledged to be very inefficient when the
height of the room is greater than the width or length. The
following table for estimation of power necessary for lighting by
this system, is taken from the bulletins of the "I-Comfort Sys-
tem." It is well to allow 30.% in excess of these figures, to allow
for accumulation of dirt and depreciation of lamps. The table is
based on direct tests with illuminometer. It shows the watts per
square foot required to produce an average illumination of 1.0
foot-candle, using I-Comfort reflectors and fixtures—i. e.. tung-
sten or Mazda lamps, hanging in inverted basket reflectors of the
corrugated silver mirror type—reflectors and lamps clean and
ceiling light, in all cases. This system especially suited to general
illumination (as in offices and ballrooms), and to places where
shadows are objectionable and great diffusion essential (as in
drafting rooms).

required for a single point source L to illuminate uniformly a
circular area of diameter d, to an intensity of i.o foot-candle,
when suspended at various heights (/i = 4-8-12-16). The curves
have been calculated from the formula / = h2H/cos3 a, and illus-
trate clearly the variation of form required for different ratios
(d/h). For any other illumination intensity, the radii of the
photometric curves will be in direct proportion.
Fig. 3. Illustrates the illumination produced by a 60 watt
tungsten lamp equipped with Extensive Holophane reflector, sus-
pended 12. feet above the plane of illumination. The diameter
of area here shown is 24. ft., or /i/rf = o.5, as specified by the
Holophane company for this type of reflector. The illumination
is only approximately uniform. The dotted line shows the photo-
metric curve theoretically required to give a perfectly uniform
(direct component of) illumination over the same area, and of
an intensity equal to the maximum produced by the reflector
(0.3 foot-candle).
Fig. 4. Shows how the photometric curve required for uni-
form horizontal illumination along a line joining two-point sources
of light, varies with the spacing of the units. An illumination of
3. foot-candles, and suspension of sources 10. feet above plane of
illumination, are assumed. Thus, when the two sources C\-C.2
are used, placed as shown, with d/h = 2.0, the corresponding
component illuminations al and a„ combine to produce a uniform
horizontal illumination all the way between the lamps. It must
be noted, however, that this is a special case, chosen for simplicity
in demonstration. Usually a point, in a large room, using I re-
flectors or curves, will receive light from at least four sources,—
perhaps eight. If a curve such as deduced in Fig. 4 be used for
each such source, a non-uniform illumination must result along
the diagonal of the square. To make it uniform along the diagon-
al as well as the side of the square, some alteration must be made
in the form of the curve. (For theory, refer to Barrows—Elec.
Ilium. Eng).
Fig. 5. Illustrates the action of the two 60. watt tungsten
lamps with Holophane I reflectors, suspended 8. ft. above the
working plane, with h/d = 4/5, as prescribed for this type of
reflector. The resultant illumination R produced along a line


97
joining the two lamps, is almost exactly uniform, except near the
sidewalls. Here, though, the increment due to diffused or indi-
rect light would bring the curve R up somewhat. This, again,
is a specially simple case; usually there are at least 4 lamps work-
ing together to illuminate every point, but the irregularities even
in such case will be of minor importance, as may be seen by work-
ing out a case, according to the method outlined.

ILLUMINATION OF STREETS AND OPEN PLACES.
E. Darrow, University of Michigan, 1892,
Consulting Engineer.
"The world was without form and void, and darkness was on
the face of the deep."
Throughout the country generally, there is a fast arousing
sentiment towards securing a better illumination of streets and
public places, and in many cities Downtown Lighting Associations
have been formed by the merchants, who are carrying to success-
ful completion, more effective and artistic street illumination.
It has been realized by the merchants and property owners that
new lighting systems were badly needed, particularly in business
districts, and the outcome has been signally successful in several
instances.
To the electrical or illuminating engineer the following list
shows the more prominent electrical units which are available for
exterior service:
(1) Carbon filament lamps in clusters or arches.
(2) Metalized filament lamps in clusters or arches.
(3) Tantalum filament lamps in clusters or arches.
(4) Tungsten filament lamps in clusters or arches.
(5) Nernst lamps with one to six glowers.
(6) Enclosed arcs D. C. and A. C.
(7) Magnetite arcs.
(8) Flaming arcs—Regenerative arcs.
(9) Carbide arcs.
(10) Quartz tube.
The efficiency, quality, color and other characteristics vary
widely.
The Watts per candle are greater in the carbon filament type,
viz.. 3^2 watts per C. P. and least in the quartz tube .25 watts
per C. P.
Many of our smaller municipalities have shown a marked pref-


IO3
erence in business districts for arches with lamps of classes
1-2-3-4, and spaced from 100 to 200 ft. apart. A good illustra-
tion of this character of service is in evidence at Norfolk,
Virginia.
FlG. I.—GRANBY STREET. NORFOLK, VA., BY NIGHT.
After a careful investigation and many suggestions as to the
design of construction, flat steel arches with a span of 40 ft., a
width of 12" and a rise of 48" were placed across the street, and
attached to the iron street railwav poles, every 100 ft. (See
Fig. 1).


Ten series incandescent center space suspension outfits were
attached to each arch. The lamps and reflectors alone hang be-
low the arch, and the whole presents a very attractive appear-
ance in day time. Each arch is lamped with 60. watt 6.6 ampere
street series lamps with automatic cut-outs and radial wave
reflectors; the neat, yet substantial design, the graceful and
symmetrical curve of the arch, have been a source of much fav-
orable comment.
Cities of first grade in the past have depended largely on series
arcs for their street illumination.
The characteristics of series arc systems, both D. C. and A. C,
need no special comment here.
The practice has been to space these lamps in single units from
300 to 600 ft. apart. Four ampere arcs of this type have been in
use in Cincinnati for the past eight years, the city's contract cal-
ling for lamps which consume 300 watts at the lamp terminal.
These lamps are spaced in the downtown districts about every
300 ft.
The illumination from these 4 ampere arcs has been an abso-
lute failure, and has given Cincinnati the name of being one of
the poorest lighted cities in the country.
The 4 ampere 300 watt arc is an absolute failure as an illumin-
ant for public places or thoroughfares.
The failure in Cincinnati was also accentuated by the fact that
the lamps were hung too close to the ground; viz., about 12 ft.,
and by the mechanical imperfection of the lamp, which caused
excessive outage.
The enclosed arc lamp is essentially an American development,
and its long burning without trimming feature, in spite of de-
creased efficiency, has made it a popular form of steet lamp.
Series enclosed lamps consuming approximately 500 watts and
using 6 to 7J4 amperes, have been found quite satisfactory and
reliable when properly spaced, and hang at proper height.
Metallic flame arcs, employing some mineral element in the
carbon electrodes to increase their luminous efficiency are enjoy-
ing an increasing use in this country on account of their high
efficiency and excellent lighting qualities.
They have the disadvantage of requiring more frequent atten-
tion and trimming, and to correct the difficulty practically the


I05
same series of remedies have been applied as in the infancy of
the old open-arc lamp.
A comparatively new type of lamp, first brought out in Europe,
but also now made in this country, is the regenerative arc lamp.
In this lamp the vapors from the impregnated electrodes are car-
ried down, and reintroduced into the arc-chamber, increasing
the luminous efficiency of the flame. Such lamps may be operated
for 75 hours without retrimming.
Metallic flame lamps of the magazine type, using one or more
FlG. 2.—METALLIC FLAME ARC ILLUMINATION, CITY PARK, NORTH SIDE, PITTS-
ISURGH, PA., PHOTOGRAPHED AFTER DARK, SEPT. 2p, IOXX).
metallic electrodes, have been deservedly successful for their
long hours of operation, low cost of maintenance, excellent effi-
ciency and good distribution. Late improvements in this type of
lamp gives promise of a steadier quality of arc, and an increasing
time between trims of at least 200 hours. (See Fig. 2).


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Toledo, Ohio, has installed during the past year a large num-
ber of these arcs at street intersections, and in the downtown
district on the main thoroughfares have erected two lamp stand-
ards every hundred feet or so, and although they have procured
a flood of white light, it is over done, not artistic in any sense,
and exceedingly unpleasant to the eye.
St. Louis, Mo., is now installing through the efforts of its
FlG. 3.—TYPE OF THREE-LAMP STANDARD INSTALLED ON BROADWAY.
Downtown Lighting Association, a system of street illumination,
using magnetite arcs.
On Broadway they have adopted a five lamp standard. (See
Fig- 3)-
The effect is brilliant, but as a permanent installation, it seems
to the writer in extremely bad taste.
On all other buiness streets one light standards are used.
The Broadway system has been grossly overdone, and gives
an unpleasant glare. The three light standards are spaced ap-


proximately sixty feet apart or ten standards (each of three
lamps) on every block, making a total of thirty arc lamps to the
block.
The other business streets are illuminated by four magnetite
arcs at each street intersection and one intermediate lamp on each
side midway. This latter arrangement gives six lamps per city
block.
The most artistic and effective illumination is the plan adopted
by Indianapolis, Indiana, Des Moines, Iowa, Seattle, Washington,
Los Angeles, California, etc.
In Indianapolis the main thoroughfare has six standards
eighty-four feet apart, each standard having five individual one
hundred watt tungsten lamps, each enclosed in a light ground
glass or thin opalescent outer globe.
Washington street is an extremely wide thoroughfare, yet with
this system a newspaper can be read at any point with ease. The
illumination is very even, well distributed, and the effect exceed-
ingly pleasing to the eye. (See Fig. 4).
Similar effects have been obtained in the other cities mentioned
above.
The carbide arc and the quartz tube are too little known yet
to have a definite place assigned to them.
Titanium carbide is the cathode, and placed below an anode
of copper, the latter being inactive and not wasting away appre-
ciably. The light is almost pure white with a slight tinge of yel-
low. It belongs to the flame type, and its efficiency increases
with current density and with increasing length of arc. On test
a lamp of this character with three amperes, 103 volts and one
inch arc, consumes only 0.228 watts horizontal candle power.
The mean spherical C. I', was 535 and the mean hemispherical
C. P. 738.
The efficiency curves show that the titanium carbide arcs are
most satisfactorily operated on constant current circuits, hence
this lamp should be particularly adaptable to existing street
series circuits.
The European quartz tube lamp is heralded as giving a flood
of beautiful golden white light faintly tinged with green, and so
brilliant that one can read ordinary print 300 ft. from this lamp.
This little lamp has a quartz tube about four inches in length,

and envelopes an illumination of 4000. mean spherical candle
power.
The claims of this newcomer are an efficiency of 0.25 per
candle, no renewals of electrode, no .cleaning of globes and no
delicate parts to get out of order. This is almost an ideal speci-
fication, but in its present form is not adaptable for interior
illumination.
It has a powerful actinic action and in its development of ultra
violet rays, it is liable to produce burns on the flesh. As an ex-
terior illuminant, it seems to be ideal and any harmful qualities
disappear when hung 15 or 20 ft. from the ground.
The lamp as now manufactured is for direct current only, but
could easily be adapted to mercury arc rectifier circuits.
(a) As a resume and final word in this section, the tendency
in arc lamps is away from enclosed ones of relative small candle
power and low efficiency towards arc lamps of higher candle
power such as the magnetite, and carbide.
For artistic effects the Luxolabra type seems to have many
attractive and exclusive features.
(b) The suspension of arc lamps of the higher candle power
should not be less than 20 feet from curb to bottom of lamp.
When there are no trees the position of lamps relative to curb
is not so important, but in suburban districts, which are wooded,
the only satisfactory solution is the middle of the street. In
downtown districts it is almost universal practice now to have
the standards and lamps on curb lines. Height of Luxolabra type
i3'-6" to top of globe.
(c) Spacing of units necessarily varies with the money avail-
able in each instance, and the effect that is desired.
Business districts vary to extremes. St. Louis with thirty
metallic flame arcs per city block has probably the maximum
illumination, while many cities think they have sufficient light
with 1-500 watt arc each 400 ft. A fairly well lighted section
would have not less than two arcs at each street intersection and
two midway in block.
The spacing of the Luxolabra type of units varies from 60 to
100 feet or from four to eight standards on each side of the street
to a block.
(d) Arc lamp systems are lighted on either moonlight sched-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
g


ule or the all night schedule. The first means approximately
2100 hours of burning and the second 4000 hours per annum.
The moonlight schedule is gradually becoming absolete.
It is difficult to make any comparison of costs, as the character-
istics of the various systems are manifestly different. Watts per
square foot mean nothing if you do not consider quality. Again
it is hard to compare cost of glare with illumination.
Perhaps, it may be well to give here some of the prices which
municipalities and merchants' associations are paying for street
service.
Cincinnati—4 ampere, 300 watt enclosed arcs, $6o.oo-$72.oo.
Toledo, Ohio—300 watt, Magnetite, $48.00.
Boston, Mass.—500 watt, Magnetite, $118.00.
St. Louis—500 watt, Magnetite, $80.00 (approx.)
Indianapolis—500 watt, A. C. enclosed, $62.50.
Indianapolis—Luxolabra Standards, $1.05 per foot front per
annum.
Des Moines, Iowa—Luxolabra Standards, $1.58 per foot front
per annum.
With the increasing use of powerful arcs there has become a
needless distress to the man in the street. When used for street
illumination such arcs should be swung high. The time has
passed when high candle powered arcs should be thrust in the
faces of pedestrians.
Such glare as is in evidence on Broadway, St. Louis or Summit
St., Toledo, is a garish display, and is most unpleasant to the
•public, and should be regulated. The glaring arc can be, and
ought to be abolished.
Dr. Steinmetz has pointed out in an admirable manner that eye
fatigue is a question of the energy imparted to it by the radia-
tions received. Further the blue end of the spectrum possesses
much less energy than the red. Also with the greater divergence
of color in more recent light sources, and the greater knowledge
of the physiological effects of radiation in general, the importance
of considering the color of light sources on purely physiological
grounds lias become a serious matter.
Frosted globes and diffusing reflectors tend to prevent trouble-
some reflection and mitigate glare.


At the February 1910 meeting of the Illumination Society of
London there was an extended discussion of glare. Although
the discussion was somewhat indefinite, there was nevertheless
a general and wholesome condemnation of glaring illumination.
In consideration of costs, renewals, up-keeps, etc., it is useless
to attempt comparison on base of charges per lamp of a rated
candle power. Open arcs, D. C. arcs enclosed, Magnetite arcs,
valued as street illuminants may vary over 150%.
The National Electric Light Association recommended the sel-
ling of illumination rather than energy, but unfortunately we
have evolved no principles by which the effective lighting on two
streets can be compared on a basis of illumination. A service con-
tract for a particular and specified illuminant, which has been
previously tried out is the only safe way to handle street lighting
contracts at present.
It will be noted that the Norfolk, Va., decorative arc lighting
for each 400 ft. block required 3000 watts at lamp terminals.
In Cincinnati, four 300 watt enclosed arcs to the block or 1200
watts at lamp terminals.
In St. Louis, Broadway's special illumination shows 30-300
watt metallic flame lamps or a total of 9000 watts per block.
In Indianapolis, with its Luxolabra standards twelve to a block,
each standard containing 5-100 watt tungsten lamps, represents
6000 watts of energy.
Thus it will be seen how widely typical installations vary as to
quantity and quality.
Under the usual conditions attendant on aerial line construc-
tion, with average spacing of lamps, the cost per lamp erected
exclusive of station equipment varies from $60.00 to $100.00.
In underground districts the construction costs may reach as
high as $250.00 per lamp.
The cost of installing the 667 Magnetite lamps in St. Louis
was close to $140,000. The depreciation in this equipment is
easily 10% per annum.
Maintenance costs in the curb-line system of illumination such
as adopted in Des Moines, Seattle and Indianapolis is about as
follows per 1000 hours of burning, each post of 5-100 watt
tungsten:


(a). 5 lamps $5.00
Glassware 2.00
Cleaning and attendance 1.00
Depreciation 2. 00

(d). Maintenance Flaming Arcs.
Carbon and trimming $ 9.50
Repairs and Globes 2.00
Depreciation 2. 00
500 K. W. H 5.00
$18.50
The energy required for these various systems of lighting
varies from 6 to 60 K. W. per mile roadway.
An ordinary 60 foot roadway has about 315,000 sq. ft. to the
mile, and with the American average of 5 to 10 K. W. per mile,
this allows a ridiculously low wattage per sq. ft.
The consumation of energy per square foot per foot candle is
about as follows:
Tungsten lighting 0.3 to 0.5
Enclosed D. C 0.25 to 0.45
Metallic flame 0.06 to 0.13


The radius of action for tungsten Luxolabra types is
about ioo feet
Enclosed arc Lamps 125 feet
Metallic flame 300 feet
From the above considerations it would appear that due to the
combined influence of public sentiment, first costs, and mainten-
ance charges, series burning constant current metallic flame light-
ing units are driving all other types of illuminants from the
residence and suburban districts of our municipalities. How-
ever, there is a strong trend in business sections of our progres-
sive cities to artistic lighting effects as is evidenced by the many
attractive forms of arches and curb-line lighting, which have been
developed in the past eighteen months.
The enclosed D. C. and A. C. arc is a back number, and con-
sidering its few advantages its wide adoption was remarkable,
particularly as it was so inefficient as an illuminant.
Likewise flaming arcs have a somewhat limited field on account
of their color element.
The metallic flame arc has a low cost of maintenance, a pleas-
ing units are driving all other types of illuminants from the
A few years ago a lamp post was simply a thing to hang a
lamp on. Today it is considered a factor of municipal enter-
prise and intelligence, and our Downtown Merchants' Lighting
Association have done much to set a new standard for artistic
and efficient public lighting.
Wiring for Electric Light.
General Considerations.
For interior installations, the tungsten lamp has proved itself
superior to all other illuminants, not only making a great reduc-
tion in cost of lighting, but if properly installed, allows a maxi-
mum of eye-comfort.
The market now affords an ample supply of well designed and
artistic fixtures, which allows the lamp to hang vertically. Cor-
rect illumination can only be figured or determined on a basis of
the lamps being in a vertical position.
As a second consideration, the proper selection of reflector and
shade holder is important. The extensive, the intensive and foe-


"5
using types of holophane shades are each designed to give a satis-
factory illumination under certain definite conditions, viz., posi-
tion of outlet, size and height of room, etc.
Third, it is a well known principle that the direct rays from the
filament should not be allowed to strike the eye, and hence care
should be taken in selection of the proper shade, together with
proper frosting of bowl. Lamps should not be frosted all over,
neither be entirely clear.
Fourth, the importance of keeping the glassware and reflecting
surfaces clean can not be too strongly emphasized.
Lastly, the mounting height of outlets or fixtures is an import-
ant consideration.
All the above considerations must be carefully analyzed by the
illuminating engineer, and on these primary factors he must de-
termine the correct wattage lamps for each outlet. The number
of watts per square foot of surface to be illuminated depends on
type of service, and varies from a minimum in halls of 0.2 watt
per sq. ft. to a maximum of 1.5 watts in stores.
Wiring.
Interior Work.
The different methods of wiring, which are now approved by
the National Board of Fire Underwriters, may be stated as fol-
lows:
(1) Exposed work.
(2) Wiring in moulding
(3) Wiring concealed.
Class I. This method of consruction has the following ad-
vantages to its credit, viz: cheapness, accessibility and durability.
This character of work is appropriate only when appearance is not
an objection, and also where there is a minimum liability of
mechanical disarrangement. Practically this type of wiring is now
only used in mills, factories and for heavy feeders.
Class II. This class of work is used to extend existing circuits
in buildings w:here the initial installation was concealed. Mould-
ing should be used on exterior of walls and ceilings where there
is danger of mechanical injury, but should not be used in damp
places. It has been a popular form, because it is convenient and
in appearance an improvement over open work.


Class III. Embraces (a) wire run in rigid conduits; (b) in
flexible metal conduits; and (c) armored cable. Rigid conduit
comes in gas pipe sizes, and if unlined can be bent without injury.
Flexible conduit of the Greenfield type is having an ever increas-
ing field. Owing to its flexibility it can be used in many places,
which prohibit the rigid construction. It is particularly useful
for completed buildings. Conduit work costs double the open
work and a third more than moulding.
Armored cable is likewise used much in completed buildings
where it is undesirable to disturb floors, and has the advantage
that it can be fished between floors and partition walls. It is
slightly less expensive than conduit construction
A choice of two wire or three wire system is largely depend-
ent on service conditions. If the source of supply is always to be
no volts, then a two wire system must of necessity follow, but if
110-220 volt is available or a probability of its being available
then a three wire system should be provided.
The difference in installation costs is not marked, although
theoretically the saving of copper should be quite marked in a
three wire system.
In planning a wiring installation for a building, the engineer
should gather all data which will affect the wiring system, such
as: kind of structure, space available for conductors, source of
supply and details affecting cost.
Outlets. This is a matter which is closely allied to the general
subject of illumination, and requires much care and thought.
Some of the salient points, which go to determine the location of
outlets: (i) type of fixture to be used; (2) decorative and archi-
tectural effects desired; (3) requirements to suit taste of owner.
Having determined the number and character of service for the
outlets, the next step is to locate the distributive center or centers.
Some of the conditions governing this are: (1) location of isol-
ated plant or service entry to building; (2) accessibility; (3) have
centers as near as possible to the risers; (4) there should be a
sufficient number of cut-out cabinets so that branch circuits may
not be too long; (5) remember the rule that no branch shall have
over 660 watts. Having determined the system, the location of
outlets and the distribution centers, the branch circuits may now
be laid out. In fireproof buildings it is an invariable practice to


lay the conduits between the top of the concrete and the rough
flooring, notching any sleepers that may cross the path of the
conduits.
All peculiarities of construction must be known in advance
before laying out the conduit lines, as this many times is the de-
termining factors in circuit layouts.
The maximum allowable loss in a branch circuit is one per cent.
At this point a plan and elevation of the feeder circuits and risers
should be made, the loads calculated and copper figured, so as
to give a loss between service connection and distributing centers
of not to exceed one per cent.
It may be found advisable to relocate the centers in order to
keep the total losses within the limits previously determined.
From the earliest days of electric lighting it was a necessity
to have a protection device in the various circuits to protect it
from overload, short circuits, etc. For this purpose a piece of
fusable metal was provided, which was copper tipped, and known
as a link fuse. This was superseded to a large extent first by
Edison Fusable Plug Cut-out, and more recently the cartridge
type of enclosed fuse has been developed.
The distribution centers are now equipped with fireproof lined
cabinets, having knife or push bottom switches and cartridge
fuses for each branch circuit.
For street lighting systems, the type of wiring mostly used is
called the series system. Most arc lamps used for street illumin-
ation are constant current lamps. This type has held sway, be-
cause of the simpliciy and the saving in copper.
The disadvantages are the high voltage necessary, and the fact
that a single open circuit puts 50 to 100 lamps out of service.
In conclusion it may be appropriate to call attention to the in-
creasing importance of artistic effect and structural ornamenta-
tion. Lighting today has passed beyond the wavering glimmer
of a tallow dip or oil lamp, and should be made an instructive
feature in the progress of science and art. Thus far artistic
progress in illumination has made little progress in the United
States, but of late, particularly in cities west of the Alleghanies,
there is a growing disposition to pay more attention to decorative
art and architecture, and a creditable line of new art designs in
fixtures are now obtainable.

The Nelson Bronze Gate Valves
Their unusual strength is gained through use of pure and
strong bronze metal, well balanced proportions of the valve
walls, and by the curved, short and compact valve body.
There are three—only three—working parts in the disc mechanism, con-
sisting of two tapered discs and one cental wedge which occupy very
small space, act as harmoniously as if cast solid, and have proven, by
every test of time and hard service in practice, to be the ideal mechan-
ism that will hold the valve tight under adverse conditions; they com-
pensate for contraction, expansion or any unusual distorting influence,
except abuse, and will stand more
of that than any other valve made.
The action of the discs is so flex-
ible that one disc will hold the
valve tight even if the other one
might become obstructed by dirt
or scale; they are so simple that
they cannot get out of order and
they cannot be wrongly assembled.
When open the discs are entirely
out of the path of the fluid, there
are no obstructions whatever, and
the fluid is as unrestricted through
the valve as through the pipe.
The valve may be safely set parti-
ally open to give any volume re-
quired; the discs will not chatter,
for they are supported by the
guides in the valve body, there is
no strain upon the stem for the same reason, and its operation is there-
fore easy, no binding at any point.
Nelson Valves are made under careful supervision, conscientiously in»
spected, and rigidly tested to more than twice the working pressure they
will have to stand in service.
They can be attached in an inverted, horizontal, vertical, angular or any
position. Are made for working pressures of 125, 175 and 300 pounds,
sizes up to 3", screwed or flanged.
A casual glance at the cuts will show clearly most of the points we men-
tion; we will be glad to submit a sample valve which you can take apart
and thoroughly inspect to your own satisfaction.
Nelson Valves are made in the Gate, Globe, Angle and Check types,
in all sizes, of Iron, Bronze or Steel, for all Pressures, for any Service.

The writer is grateful for this opportunity to commend the gen-
tleman who has succeeded him as Professor of Geodesy and Sur-
veying on the teaching staff of the Department of Engineering,
to his students and his colleagues, in order that they may extend
to him their kindly interest and most friendly consideration. He
is a very loyal I", of M. man. He graduated in civil engineering
in 1895 and received his C.E. in 1899 from the same source.


Since 1895 he has been actively engaged in the practice of his
profession in positions of responsibility and leadership. A list of
these can be found in the Announcement of the Department of
Engineering in the register of his class,—1895. He has been a
pioneer as well as a leader not only in engineering but in other
important matters. It is doubtful if any one has a larger share
than he in the preparation of that new chapter in jurisprudence
in this country known as Irrigation Law, wherein the time-hon-
ored ideas that have ruled in the decisions of questions relating
to water courses have been replaced by others. This has been
necessary because of the diversion of the waters of streams from
their natural channels for purposes of beneficial irrigation, not to
be again returned to those channels, and this diversion repeated.
Irrigation law furnishes the basis for successful agriculture in
many states, and parts of states, that furnish subsistence for a
large population. Probably the irrigation laws of Wyoming,
which has been the field of Professor Johnston's most extensive
labor and influence, both in framing and administering irrigation
law, would be regarded as the model for such statutes in this
country by the large majority of persons who are informed upon
such matters. However, not only the law but the works, the sur-
veys, the hydraulics, and the administration of the law, also the
adjudication and adjustment of all kinds of questions and disputes
about rights and claims, have had the benefit of his genius, his
intelligence, experience, unswerving integrity, and the singleness
of purpose in his devotion to the best interests and welfare of the
people of the commonwealth, or of the districts wherein the ques-
tions arose. No better illustration of this, or of his methods, or
of the man himself, can be given than is to be found in the intro-
duction to his last report, reproduced below:
This is the fourth report of the State Engineer of Wyoming to be sub-
mitted by the present incumbent of that office. In preparing a summary
of the work of the department for the past seven and one-half years, it
seems fitting that two or three matters of a somewhat personal nature be
reviewed.
The State Engineer is very appreciative of the uniform support that
the water users of the State have given the office. An attempt has been
made by him to serve the large majority of water users and to show none
special favors. Communities rather than individuals have been consid-


creel. This, we believe, is the intent of the law. It is what the law should
uphold. Water can only be public property when the public is protected.
If any individual, or any association of individuals, is given an absolute
ownership in water or even in water rights ,then, not only other individ-
uals, but entire communities, must suffer. A part of this report is devoted
to a discussion of the water right question. The reader is referred thereto.
It is natural that the State Engineer should be criticized here and there,
when the individual is prevented from doing those things which would
mean disaster to his neighbors. It is natural that such an individual should
he more active in his opposition to the State Engineer than these neigh-
bors are in the defense of that officer. The individual realizes how much
he is affected by the ruling of the State Engineer. The community seldom
appreciates that it is benefited by such action. Quite often the individual
is able to arouse the hostility of those whose interests arc protected by the
State Engineer's decision.
The public generally has but little conception of the duties of State
officers. The individual who deals with the State Engineer's office has
only his own case in mind. The man who'mails an application for permit
to the State Engineer does not realize that there are from thirty-five to
forty other applications mailed to the State Engineer from different parts
of the State on the same day. He does not realize that every application
must be filed so that the records will show what disposition is made of it;
that many have to be sent back for correction; that many conflict with
existing rights; that from two to live of every hundred have to be rejected
to protect communities; that the plans for canals and reservoirs all have
to be carefully inspected; that in case of high dams the State Engineer
is required to appoint an engineer to supervise construction; that under
the Carey Act the State Engineer has to report on the water supply and
approve the plans and specifications and see to it that such plans and spec-
ifications are carried into effect; that in the adjudication of streams the
State Engineer is required to make surveys which will show the location
of all ditches and the area of all irrigated lands; that he has to maintain
gaging stations on streams and keep records of the results of this work
in his office; that in the adjudication of streams the State Engineer has
general charge; that he is president of the State Board of Control which
passes on every question that is raised in the determination of rights to
use water and every question that may arise after such rights have been
defined; that in the distribution of water under rights that arc defined, ap-
peals may be taken from the decisions of water commissioners to the Di-
vision Superintendents and then to the State Engineer; that in the forma-
tion of irrigation districts the State Engineer has to report on the feasi-
bility, practicability and estimated cost of the proposed improvements in the


irrigation works; that the State Engineer is required to make comprehen-
sive reports every two years of all that his department lias accomplished.
The law also provides that the State Engineer shall make surveys which
will show the merits of various irrigation projects so that he will he ahle
to give advice to prospective investors.
While the State Engineer is carrying on these various and numerous
duties, he may he called to attend a meeting of the Capitol Building Com-
mission, of which he is a member. This commission has charge of the
maintenance of all State buildings at Cheyenne. He may be summoned
to a session of the Immigration Commission which advertises the State
and tries to induce settlers to take up their residence here. He is Secre-
tary of the State Board of Examining Engineers, which passes upon the'
qualifications of all engineers and surveyors of the State who are engaged
in an irrigation practice. This board meets as often as possible, and it
conducts examinations every week. It keeps complete records of all the
business it performs and issues licenses to those who qualify under the
law. The State Engineer has a multitude of other duties which are not
prescribed by law, but which come to him in connection with the duties
that are defined in the statutes. The State Engineer, to be efficient, must
know the State thoroughly. He must be familiar with every stream. He
must understand conditions in every community. He must have a techni-
cal training and a long experience to enable him to pass intelligently on
all of the problems that come to him. The law does not enable him to
shift the responsibility to an assistant or a deputy.
The State Engineer wishes, in this message to the water users of Wy-
oming, to say a word in behalf of the office which means so much to them.
It is not believed that the future of the State Engineer's office will be dif-
ferent from what it has always been. Practically every stream in the
State has been adjudicated. This work has been performed without ex-
pense to the water user. In neighboring States an adjudication costs as
much as the water right, including all construction expenses. After water
rights are secured and determined Wyoming protects them without expense
to the indivdual water users. When rights are once established, they are
definite and new questions cannot arise to disturb them. In many states
water rights are subject to attack practically all of the time. It has been
the aim of the State Engineer's office at all times, to protect every use.
This means that every user has been guaranteed as much water as has
been available for the purpose defined by and based on beneficial use,
but he has had nothing to sell and nothing in the way of water or water
rights for speculation. The people of Wyoming owe it to themselves and
to those who follow them to support every principle which will maintain
this condition.


The State Engineer made a rule for the government of his own con-
duct when he first accepted the office in 1903. He did not see how he
could serve the water users of Wyoming and at the same time be em-
ployed by those who were building large irrigation works. He therefore
decided to keep out of private practice along irrigation lines in Wyoming.
This decision has never been deviated from in any particular. When a
State Engineer tries to do business in any other way he must fail to pro-
tect the interests of those he is presumed to serve.
The State Engineer does not make these statements in his own defense.
He is satisfied with the record he has made. He is willing to leave this
matter to the calm and sober judgment of the future. It is, after all, the
judgment of time that satisfies the public mind as to the truth and as to
the wisdom of all policies. The State Engineer has received the most
severe criticism for those things in which he has taken the greatest pride.
The reclamation of the ceded portion of the Shoshone Indian Reservation
in Fremont County is the one problem that has brought forth his best
efforts in an attempt to help those who have settled on these lands. This
work is to be approved by every fair-minded man in the State within the
next five years. The State Engineer makes this statement because he
knows that he has been right throughout the entire four years that the
work has been in progress. He is satisfied that he has done all that has
been possible under the conditions that have prevailed. A full account of
this work for the past two years is contained elsewhere in this report.
In addressing the water users of Wyoming it can be said that the
State has never had an engineer who has been unmindful of the interests
of the irrigator. An incompetent man cannot hold the office without bring-
ing ruin 011 the water user generally. The office is in close touch with
every water problem in the State and the State Engineer must be, as he
has always been, a man who can take up any question presented to him
without fear, favor or prejudice. The State Engineer is greatly interested
in the future of his office because it is of so much importance to water
users. He urges the water users of the State to believe with full confi-
dence that the man who occupies the State Engineer's office is their repre-
sentative in truth and in fact; that his efforts are all directed for the ben-
efit of the majority of the community in which each may reside; that he
is not engaged in any private practice that can in any way affect his public
duties; that any man who is placed at the head of the administration of
the water resources of Wyoming is worthy of confidence until he demon-
strates his unfitness for the position; that the office of State Engineer
should never be brought into a political campaign; that the intent of the
law is to separate the office from political turmoil and political influence;


that it is the most important office in the State in so far as development and
material progress are concerned.
The present State Engineer has only one desire at this time. He
hopes that the law will be perfected where this is possible. He hopes that
principles that are essential to the protection of communities will always
be upheld.
To our students I repeat what I have often said before,—you
are going to school to real engineers, many of them distinguished
in their profession, both as engineers and as men. Try your best
to appreciate this fact and profit from it to the fullest extent.
Professor Johnston is a worthy example for us all. In his hands
our every interest and the welfare of us all, as well as the good
and great name of our noble university, also the thorough work
of our department, arc all as safe as can be predicated of any
human effort.
To recite details of his labors is here unnecessary and it would
extend this notice unduly, but it may be mentioned that during
the past two years his supervision has extended over works in
great variety costing some twenty millions of dollars, and the di-
rection of staffs embracing over a hundred persons, also the adju-
dication and settlement of "claims" by the hundred. The works
embrace some of those that arc the most notable. The labors of
those working under his direction are making the history of en-
gineering. The "claims" and disputes have been settled, not passed
on to become trouble-makers in the future.
To have my work in the university taken up and continued by
such a man is of the greatest satisfaction to me.


THE DESIGN OF EARTH DAMS.
Clarence T. Johnston.
The earth dam is the common type of construction. It is nat-
ural that it should be the most ancient type. Under proper con-
ditions it furnishes the cheapest and one of the best dams known
to the engineer. During the past seven or eight years the writer
has designed a number of earth dams and he has examined and
approved plans for many hundred similar structures. A high
earth dam is more difficult to design, as a rule, than is a masonry
dam of equal height. Theory applies to a masonry structure
much more satisfactorily than it does to an earth dam. One of
the prime necessities for success in the design of earth dam is
a knowledge of materials which enter into construction.
The dimensions of a typical form of earth dam, given in cross-
section, may be represented in terms of the height of the dam,
h (Fig. i ). The up-stream, or water slope may be 3/1, the lower,
* 3h 4,'Z^S. &amp;h $
Fig. I
down-stream or dry slope may be 2A and the top width may be
h/$. The area of the cross-section of this dam is 2.7/r. If h is
reduced to yards, then the volume of material in the dam per run-
ning yard of length is 2.ylr cubic yards. In making estimates,
following preliminary surveys, it is often convenient to employ
some such expression. Figure 2 indicates graphically how the
volume varies with the height and it is well for the engineer to
have this curve in his mind while he is designing an earth dam.
The cost of constructing an earth dam varies with the volume
of material and it is also influenced by the height of the dam in-

dependent of the volume. This increase in cost with the height
is due to many small factors that can. only be briefly referred to.
The average haul is greater for high dams. The immediate
shrinkage of earth work is greater. Time occupied in going to
and from work and the time that is employed in raising machin-

ery all go to increase the unit cost. If we assume that earth can
be placed in a low dam for twenty cents per cubic yard, we might
employ the following formula for obtaining the approximate cost
of higher dams:
Cost per cubic yard equals 2.yh2 (20c plus .2/1'c).
This formula would place the unit cost of a dam 30 feet high
at 22c. while the unit cost for a dam 150 feet high would be 35c.
It should be remembered that h in the formula is in yards. Fig-
ure 3 shows graphically the relation of the height of a dam and
the cost per yard of length.
After we know what the form of the cross-section of the dam
is to be and when we have made estimates to determine whether
or not the proposed structure is feasible, we can consider some of
the important details of the construction of the dam. The design
of earth dams has not changed greatly until within the past few
years. For a long time engineers have recommended and used
cores in earth dams. A core is provided by placing within the


dam a wall of material such as clay which is more impervious to
water than is any other material used in the construction of earth
dams. This wall runs throughout the length of the dam and from
the natural ground surface to an elevation well above high water.
Many different kinds of cores have been devised aside from the

clay wall. Timber has been employed for this purpose. Concrete
and masonry walls have been built along the center lines of dams.
When we study the nature and purpose of a core we must be
excused for a little speculation. We must assume that the core
is provided for the purpose of making the dam stronger. It is
manifestly designed to reduce or prevent percolation through the
dam. In other kinds of construction the mind of man has evolved
plans that have led to something that is water resisting where
such a condition is essential. For instance, our houses are built
with the water resisting surfaces on the outside. We wear rain
coats over our other clothing and not between our coats and our
shirts. It does not seem reasonable that all of our ideas based
on common sense should be discarded when we are called upon
to design an earth dam. To place the water resisting material in
a dam at a place where we know it only protects a part of the
structure and where its beneficial function, if it has such, is not
visible, does not appeal to one who has studied other kinds of


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
construction. Considerations of this kind led the writer to make
some experiments a few years ago. Of the 29 model dams built
and tested but one can be briefly described.
The dimensions we have already assumed for the cross-section
of an earth dam are common in practice. Figure 4 shows the
cross-section of the model dam to be described. This model was
Fig. 4-
built for the purpose of determining the value of a clay core. The
dam, aside from the core, was constructed of a sandy loam. It
was finished early in April, the water turned in, and it remained
unmolested until late in October. The water standing against
the dam was kept at a uniform level, as nearly as possible, through-
out this time. When the water was turned out of the small reser-
voir formed by the "dam, the water slope of the dam was found
to have settled as shown in Figure 5. Beyond this the dam seem-
ed in good condition. There was practically no water leaving
the dam through seepage. To the casual observer the dam would
have been pronounced a success. It had held water for nearly
seven months.
The sandy loam on both sides of the core was removed so that
the condition of the interior of the dam might be ascertained. The
material between the core and the water face was completely sat-
urated. This was to have been anticipated because the face was


not protected and it was known that the core would prevent per-
colation to a large extent. The material on the other side of the
core was in good condition. The core itself had absorbed water
to such an extent that when the sandy loam was removed on both
sides it settled to the base and had the appearance of mortar as
it is deposited by a hod carrier. The location and appearance of
the core and the other material of the dam after investigation is
also shown in Figure 5. Great care was exercised to remove the
sandy loam without disturbing the core any more than necessary.
If the model had been left undisturbed a few months longer it
would have failed. The dam was gradually absorbing water and
the clay core simply retarded the operation.
It is plain that this kind of construction is not good. The writer
was called soon after this to examine a dam in actual use which
had been replaced several times. It was never over-topped by
the water. It would simply absorb water until the saturation had
reached a certain point when it would apparently float away. The
slopes of the dam as it stood after replacement were too steep.
The principal trouble, however, was in the construction of the
dam as it stood. The material was of such character that water
was slowly absorbed and there was sufficient clay in the interior
of the dam to make drainage very difficult. By installing a few
tile drains running from the lower toe of the dam to a point
slightly more than half way through the structure and by flatten-
ing the slopes a little the dam has given good satisfaction and has
been used continuously for the past eight or ten years. This ex-
periment in draining a dam was very conclusive in its results.
It is apparent that it is better to eliminate the core altogether and
to substitute drainage even though no other precautions are taken
to strengthen the dam.
The idea of draining an earth dam is not new, but it has not
been given sufficient attention. It is manifest that some plan
should be evolved and put in practice whereby the dam may be
protected from the water and the rate of percolation reduced to
the minimum. When this is accomplished the necessity for ex-
tensive drainage is lessened. Not only is it necessary to
prevent water entering and remaining in the dam in large vol-
umes, but it is essential that the water face of the dam be pro-


tected from wave action and erosion clue to the rise and fall of
the water surface. It has been customary to riprap the water
face of the dam with hand laid stone paving. This may protect
the dam from the action of the water, but it is expensive com-
pared with the beneficial function performed. The riprapping
does not tend to make the dam more water proof. It does not
always prevent erosion on the water face, for often during high
winds the wave action will wear away the fine material of the dam
back of the paving and permit a stone to settle here and there.
This brings about settlement in other places and before many
months the face of the dam consists of ridges of paving material
and broad stretches of unprotected earth. It is plain that it would
be impossible to maintain a facing of clay on the water slope of
the dam, even though it were protected by the best kind of rip-
rapping. Clay when wet will run and it will pass away in sus-
pension in water that is almost quiet. It seemed necessary, there-
fore, if clay is to be used for this purpose, that it be placed in the
body of the dam where it will be protected from the action of the
water. The clay core doubtless had its birth in reasoning of this
kind. We would not have high regard for a rain coat that would
have to be worn under, other clothing to protect it against injury
from water.
Reinforced concrete laid on the water surface of an earth dam
furnishes a surface which not only retards percolation into the
dam, but it makes an admirable protection against wave action.
The concrete need not be laid in a heavy course. From three to
six inches in thickness will answer for any dam.
It is advisable to carry the concrete of the face to the extreme
toe of the dam and from there vertically until it enters some im-
pervious material, such as rock or shale. Sheet steel piling can
be substituted for the concrete below the toe of the dam where
conditions are favorable for pile driving. The steel reinforcing
of the concrete facing above can be attached to the top of the
sheet piling. By bringing the concrete wall down over the top
of the sheet piling a very satisfactory union of the two materials
can be made. Figure 6 shows a dam constructed in this way.
The water slope of the dam has been reduced to 2 to I. This is
often permissable where the concrete face is employed. The dam


13
shown in cross-section in Figure 6 is paved on both the dry and
wet slopes. This furnishes a spillway over the dam. A water
cushion is provided at the toe of the dry slope. The drainage
tile, the outlet pipes and the spillway all discharge into this cush-
ion. The controlling device for the outlet pipes is located under
the facing on the dry slope of the dam and it is reached by a pro-
tected entry from one side of the depression in which the dam
Valve, chamber

rests. The outlet pipes and the controlling works are standard,
—cast iron pipe and gate valves.
The intention has been to show general types of construction
and not to enter into details. Concrete may be employed to ad-
vantage in building the box at the lower toe which provides the
water cushion, in constructing collars about the iron pipe to pre-
vent percolation along them and in the construction of the valve
house and approach thereto.
It is well to permit an earth dam to stand for a year or longer
before the concrete facing is applied. This gives the earth an
opportunity to settle. The surface of the concrete can be pro-
tected by an application of coal tar and maintained by similar ap-
plications from year to year.


GAS AS AN ILLUMINATING AGENT.
Alfred H. White.
It is a commonplace of industrial history that eras of financial
prosperity and smooth sailing are eras of stagnation as regards
technical development. The inventor with an idea to develop
and the engineer with an improvement to propose, receive scant
hearing so long as the sky is clear, and it seems safe to rest on
the oars. It is only when storms of competition threaten, or more
usually have actually broken, that all hands work together to
ward off threatened disaster.
The use of gas as an illuminating agent affords no exception
to the rule. For fifty years it had no rival more formidable than
the kerosene lamp and held undisputed if flickering sway in the
lighting of city streets, stores and the better grades of residence.
Then through the genius of Edison, Brush and others came the
electric light and the new industry, seeking every weapon which
would aid it in storming the citadel where gas was intrenched,
shouted abroad the advantages of liberation from the tyranny of
the match, put the dull street lamp to rout with the dazzling
arc, and twined for the home graceful chandeliers which did not
throw ugly shadows on the table below. Hard pressed and facing
certain defeat. Gas seized the staff reached out in the nick of
time by Dr. Auer von Welsbach and with the new high power
light and the slogan "It is cheaper to use gas," started to win
back its lost ground. Electricity found a new weapon, the tungs-
ten lamp. Gas countered with the inverted Welsbach. The fight
for the past five years has been a merry one with the consumer,
the gainer by every improvement put forth by either party. It is
the purpose of this article to set forth in a popular way the pres-
ent position of gas as an illuminating agent.
The Welsbach mantle provided the gas industry with a source
of light which is cheaper, and more nearly like daylight, than any
which its great competitor electricity can show. A standard up-
right Welsbach mantle burning four feet of gas per hour and
with clear chimney will easily give sixty candle power in the hor-


izontal direction or fifteen candles per cubic foot during a life of
over 500 hours. Many mantles have been studied in our labora-
tories which have given better results, burning with fair efficiency
even more than 1500 hours, but taking into account the high loss
by accidental breakage the figure of 500 hours is safe. The mod-
ern electric tungsten lamps give about \]/\ candles per watt, and
the life of the lamp is possibly longer although breakage is high
in this case also. On the basis of a price of $1.00 per thousand
cubic feet for gas and 10c. per kilowatt for electricity the cost of
burning for 1000 hours a 60 candle Welsbach as compared with
a 60 watt (48 candle) tungsten lamp would be $4.00 for gas as
compared with $6.00 for electricity. When the mantle broke a
new one could be bought for twenty-five cents. The electric
lamp would cost six times the sum.
Artificial light is not usually wanted however to illuminate the
upper part of the walls and ceiling but to light study tables, show
cases and counters. Here is where the inverted Welsbach shines
pre-eminent as its greatest candle power instead of being thrown
horizontally is directed vertically downward. There can be no
question but that under almost all conditions of competition where
the installations are designed skilfully, gas will be found to give
a better illumination at a decidedly lower price than electricity.
The color of the various artificial light sources becomes of
commercial importance in illumination of many stores where col-
ors must be matched, and is a point worthy of consideration
everywhere. The eye is an unreliable photometric instrument
which is hardly more than able to say that the carbon filament in-
candscent electric lamp yields a rather red light, the tungsten
lamp gives a whiter light, and the best Welsbach lights a still
whiter light.
The subject was first placed on a scientific basis by Herbert
E. Ives who in a paper presented before the Illuminating Engi-
neering Society in May, 1908, described a method for the color
comparison of artificial illuminants. The following data from
his paper show the rank of the various sources of light, as com-
pared with daylight to which an arbitrary value of 33.3 has been
applied in the red, blue and green primary colors.

All of the sources investigated except the mercury arc show
too much of the red and green, and too little of the blue when
compared with daylight, but the Welsbach mantle is the best of
all. showing the smallest excess of red and green and the smallest
deficiency of blue. Next to it but decidedly below comes acety-
lene and next the tungsten electric. The mercury arc on account
of its excess of blue is not a pleasant light and is therefore prac-
tically excluded as a commercial source although in the next to
the last column of the table headed "White Sensation Efficiency"
it occupies the highest place, the Welsbach, acetylene and the
tungsten lamp again following in the order named. In the last
column headed "White Light Efficiency" which gives the white
light available by the use of absorbing screens, the mercury arc
drops out altogether as "not suited for color discrimination." Day-
light is given a value of 100 and next to it comes the Welsbach
with a numerical value of 50.5 and the statement—"a light of
yellowish hue with a large amount of available white and there-
fore suited to color discrimination.'' On the same scale the acety-
lene is given a grade of 33.2 and the tungsten lamp only 26.2.


17
These figures show conclusively that the Welsbach light is to be
preferred to all others from the standpoint of color.
One of the objections sometimes urged against gas is that the
gases from its combustion vitiate the atmosphere. This objection
is largely fanciful. It is true that a burner consuming four feet
of gas per hour will use up rather more than four feet of oxygen
and produce about two feet of carbon dioxide per hour. It is
also true that the ventilation of a room is considered bad when
the amount of carbon dioxide in the air rises from the normal
amount of .04% to .10% because of respiration. But there should
be a sharp distinction drawn between the emphasis to be laid on
carbon dioxide from respiration which indicates pollution from
bacteria and poisonous waste products from the lungs, and the
carbon dioxide from a gas burner. It is hardly possible to con-
ceive conditions where the vitiation of the air from properly
manipulated gas burners can be serious.
The great advantage of the electric light is its convenience.
No one has yet devised a really dependable device for turning on
and off gas light by the pressure of a button at a distance. The
heat from a gas light is also greater than from an electric incan-
descent of equal candle power. Advantages on the side of gas
however are greater cheapness, better color of light, and free-
dom from fluctuation. In latter years gas has been more than
holding its own with its great competitor.


THE TYPE CHARACTERISTIC OF IMPULSE WHEELS
AND ITS USE IN DESIGN.
By S. J. Zowski.
[Copyrighted, 1910, by S. J. Zowski.]
A previous article by the author, entitled "A Comparison of
American High-Speed Runners for Water Turbines,"* the first of
this series, gave the method of deriving a characteristic called
the Type Characteristic, by means of which a convenient classifi-
cation and comparison of existing runners and runner types is
obtained. In a second article, entitled "A Rational Method of
Determining the Principal Dimensions of Water-Turbine Run-
ners,"! the second of this series, the convenience of using the
Type Characteristic for computing new runners was demonstrat-
ed. Both articles, however, dealt with the radial inward-flow
turbine only. But as the Type Characteristic renders equally good
service with all other turbine classes, it is proposed in this article
to investigate the impulse wheel in a similar way.
The following notation will be used:
d = the actual diameter of the jet.§ In this country only circular noz-
zles are used, therefore square jets will not be considered at all
in this article, although such jets would not change the theory
materially.
D = the nominal wheel diameter, :'. e., the diameter of the circle tan-
gent to the center line of the jet, which circle might appropriate-
ly be called the "impulse circle." Some engineers call this circle
the "Pelton circle," in recognition of Mr. Pelton's contributions
to the development of the impulse wheel.
c = the velocity of the jet.
v = the peripheral velocity of the wheel, measured on the impulse
circle.
// = the net head acting in the nozzle.
H-P — the power of the wheel, in horsepowers.
N = the rotative speed of the wheel, in revolutions per minute.
Unless specified otherwise, the foot and the second are the units.

§ This is not the nozzle diameter, but the actual diameter of the jet
at the contraction, if there is one, or in any case at the minimum section.


DERIVATION OF TYPE CHARACTERISTIC.
The jet velocity c may be expressed in terms of the head as
follows:
c=f.yTTTR (1)
For nozzles of good design and workmanship, the velocity co-
efficient /c may be taken as 0.97. The discharge of the nozzle is
Q= — f&lt;: vTfH = 6.3 /« d' M~H (2)
4
The power developed by Q and H is
62.42(g// yge
550 8.8
where c is the wheel efficiency.
By substitution we obtain:
H-P = 0.716 c U d' H y~H
Substituting unity for H gives the power at head of one foot, or
the specific power:
H-P, = 0.716 e U dr = Kp dr (3)
where
A'p = 0.716 e /c (4)
In determining the principal turbine dimensions, the wheel
efficiency is generally assumed as 80%. Therefore we may sub-
stitute 0.8 for e, which with 0.97 for /,, gives Kr =0.5565. Solv-
ing eq. (3) with this value, we obtain a convenient formula for
figuring the required jet diameter.

The peripheral velocity of the wheel, measured on the impulse
circle, is
V = jr MzgH (6)
For polished or well-finished buckets the coefficient may be taken


as 0.485/c which, with /c = 0.97 equals 0.47.* Since the rotative
speed of the wheel, N, is equal to 60 v/*D, we obtain by sub-
stituting the value of v from eq. (6),
W= 153 17 A 2) \ H~
Putting //=i in this formula we find the specific speed (speed
at one-foot head) to be

where

for /» = 0.47, A'N = 72.f
Using this value in eq. (7), we obtain a convenient formula
for computing the required wheel diameter:

The expression for the Type Characteristic is

This gives

With /v = 0.47, /0 = 0.97 and e = 0.80 (or with /\N = 72 and A'p
= 0.5565), we obtain for the type characteristic the simple for-
mula
Kt = 53-6777 (12)
Thus the type characteristic of impulse wheels is a simple
function of the ratio of jet and wheel diameter. Therefore, the
determination of the limiting values of Kt for impulse wheels
means the determination of the limits for the ratio d/D with
which reasonable efficiency may be obtained.
* The value of f» V 2 g = 3.77 corresponds to the speed constant
Ky = 4.588 to 7.006 for radial inward-flow turbines.
t The corresponding value of A'n for radial inward-flow turbines is
87 to 134.


LIMITING RATIOS OF JET DIAMETER TO WHEEL DIAMETER.
It is obvious that there will be a certain maximum value for
this ratio, because, going for instance to the extreme, a wheel
diameter equal to the jet diameter, or d/D= I, would evidently
be impossible to use. Therefore there will be a certain maximum
value for Kt which cannot be exceeded by an impulse wheel
using a single jet.
A minimum value for Kt does not exist, theoretically, as the
ratio d/D could be decreased to any desired amount. In practice,
of course, we would come to a limit also in this direction, on
account of the limitation as to the size of a wheel. But actual
problems would never bring us near this limit, as a wheel of given
capacity would never be required to have so low a rotative speed
(hence low A't) as to require wheels of diameter too large to be
built or operated successfully. We therefore do not need to con-
sider the question of the minimum value for Kl at all.
The question of the maximum value for Kt, however, is of
great importance for practical application, as this will determine
the number of wheels or number of nozzles required for the
given power and speed. To answer this question, we need, since
Kt is a function of d/D, only to find the least wheel diameter
that can be used satisfactorily in connection with a jet of given
diameter.
The sketches, Figs. I, 2 and 3, bring out the chief conditions
involved. As bucket B progresses from the position shown in
Fig. 1, the jet will be split in two parts, one feeding bucket B,
the other proceeding with the jet velocity c in its initial direction.
When bucket B reaches the position shown in Fig. 3, the water
particle which was at m when bucket B separated it from the
main jet will have moved to x. Similarly, the water particle
which was at n when the bucket separated it from the main jet
(Fig. 2) will have moved to y (Fig. 3). These distances are

The curve xyz, Fig. 3, shows thus the end of the jet which has
been cut off from the main jet, in its correct instantaneous posi-
tion at the time when the entrance edge of bucket B is at o. As
the wheel moves farther, the separated jet will move, too; when
the bucket B reaches, for instance, the position of bucket A in
Fig. 1, the curve xyz (Fig. 3) will be moved to x1y1s1 (Fig. 1).

It is apparent that, in order to utilize the entire energy con-
tained in the jet, no particle must slip through, without giving up
its energy to the buckets. Therefore, the wheel and buckets must
be designed so that the last particle of the jet separated by bucket
B from the main jet, namely particle z, will reach bucket A and
will be fully deflected by bucket A before this bucket, or that
point of the bucket at which the last particle should discharge,
leaves the sphere of the jet.
While it is a simple matter to determine the position of the
bucket A at the moment when the last particle reaches it, it is very
difficult, if possible at all, to determine the position at which the
last particle has just completed its flow through the bucket. A
great deal of judgment must be used in this respect, and, there-
fore, special care is advised in all cases where only a short time
is left for the bucket to remain in the sphere of the jet after the
last particle has entered.
This time can be increased in two ways: (1) By decreasing
the time necessary for the last particle to reach the bucket A.
This is secured by decreasing the pitch of the buckets, thus short-
ening the sections of jet cut off by the buckets. (2) By increas-
ing the total length of time during which each bucket remains in
the sphere of the jet, or in other words, by increasing the length
of the arc ool.
In decreasing the pitch or increasing the number of the buck-
ets, however, we soon come to a limit. From Fig. 4, showing two
consecutive buckets in section, it is apparent that the smaller the

water velocity grows larger, and this means increased discbarge

demands that we should make angle fl as small and the pitch as
large as possible. Allowing a certain discharge loss as the maxi-
mum, we cannot reduce the pitch beyond that which corresponds
to this discharge loss. Furthermore, practical considerations will
not permit using an excessive number of buckets. If, for in-
stance, the buckets are bolted to the wheel disk, which is the gen-
eral practice in this country, the flanges must have a certain
width, thus giving a minimum pitch which may not even be as
small as that resulting from the value of the discharge loss that
we are willing to allow. In other words, decreasing the pitch of
the buckets, for the sake of lengthening the time left for the
bucket to remain in the sphere of the jet after the last particle
has entered, can be carried only to a certain limit.
Beyond this limit the flow conditions of the last particle can
be improved only by lengthening the arc oo^ This we can se-
cure by increasing the height of the arc, i. e., by making the
buckets longer. But here again we are not able to go very far,
as it is obvious that the buckets cannot be made excessively long
in comparison with the wheel diameter. We come thus to a
limit also in this direction, and if now the flow conditions are not
satisfactory, the last but most effective means will have to be
used, namely that of increasing the length of the arc by increas-
ing the wheel diameter proper, or decreasing the value of Kt.
This, it is believed, shows clearly the nature of the impulse-
wheel problem, when for a given size of jet the least possible
wheel diameter, or the maximum value of Kt, is to be determined.
MAXIMUM TYPE CHARACTERISTIC.
In the summer of 1908 the writer had to deal with this prob-
lem quite extensively, when he was developing a type of buckets
which were to be used as "standards" and which would reach the
minimum value of /Ct allowable for radial inward-flow turbines,
with as few wheels or nozzles as possible. After all means to
improve the flow conditions for the last particle, as described
above, had been exhausted; that is to say, after the pitch had been
reduced to a minimum and the length of the buckets had been
increased to a maximum, the least wheel diameter with which a
perfect reaction of the last particle could be obtained was about
10.5 times the jet diameter. With wheel diameter reduced to 9


THE MICHIGAN TECH NIC
times the jet diameter, about 2% to 3% of the jet would not
react fully.
On account of the necessity of making several arbitrary as-
sumptions in order to be able to find the position of the bucket
at the time when the last particle of water has completed its flow
through the bucket, the results involve some degree of uncer-
tainty in the neighborhood of the critical point. Therefore, the
values found by the writer must not be looked upon as being
mathematically exact.
The question whether the wheel diameter should not be
brought below D = 10.5c? or whether it should be allowed to go
FIG. S. PATH OF LAST PART OF JET.
somewhat lower, say, to D = gd, cannot be settled by a general
rule, as efficiency is not always the only deciding factor. There
will be many cases in practice where the advantages of higher
value of Ki, and consequently reduced number of wheels or
nozzles necessary for the given power and speed, will justify a
certain additional loss by imperfect reaction. A loss of 3% will
often be allowable to secure these advantages. Therefore, let us
establish as limiting values:

making Kt about 6; when loss from imperfect reaction
can be about 2% to 3%.


The writer does not advise trying to carry Kt higher than 6,
as the loss due to imperfect reaction increases rapidly. It must
be borne in mind, however, that even values of 5 or 6 can be ob-
tained only by buckets especially adapted for such high values.
These buckets must be considerably longer than standard Pelton
or Doble buckets, for instance.
In these special buckets, which may appropriately be called
high-speed buckets, the part X, Fig. 5, is particularly important.
The smaller the wheel diameter the more inclined will be the
bucket relatively to the jet at the moment when the last water
particles enter, and consequently more water will be discharged at
part X. This makes it necessary to design this part of the bucket
with the same care as part Y, where the first and main part of the
jet discharges; the bucket must be kept sufficiently deep at X and
the angle P kept sufficiently small. Also another point must be
mentioned in this connection: Because the increased length of
the bucket makes the flow conditions at the entrance in the bucket
less favorable, the practice of moving the entrance edge toward
the center, as is done on all modern buckets of good design, be-
comes a necessity for high-speed buckets.
In the article "A Rational Method of Determining the Prin-
cipal Dimensions of Water Turbine Runners," it was shown that
the minimum value of Kt for radial inward-flow turbines is
about 12. With favorable conditions, slightly smaller values can
be reached, down to about 10. (The Allis-Chalmers Co., of Mil-
waukee, has built a radial inward-flow turbine for the Palmer
Mountain Tunnel and Power Co. for the following data: H =
350, H-P = 6$o, N = 6oo; these make Kt = 10.2.). If now the
maximum value of Kt for impulse-wheels is 6, it is apparent that
we can equal the minimum limit of radial inward-flow turbines
by using four single-nozzle impulse-wheels, or a four-nozzle
wheel; thus the entire field of requirements for water-turbines
can be covered satisfactorily by these two turbine classes alone.
The conditions in this direction have been improved recently by
the development of two-stage radial inward-flow turbines, a few
of which have been in successful operation in Europe. These


two-stage turbines extend the field of the radial inward-flow tur-
bine in the neighborhood of the minimum limit.*
SUMMARY.
If the value of Kt computed from the given power, head and
rotative speed is smaller than 12, but larger than 6, a multiple
impulse-wheel must be built.
If Kt is equal to 6, a single impulse-wheel can be built, but
in this case an additional loss of 2% to 3%, due to imperfect re-
action of some part of the jet, must be reckoned with.
If Kt is 5 or less, a single impulse-wheel can be used without
any additional loss due to imperfect reaction. However, as long
as Kt is larger than about 4.2, the design must be very careful,
and the buckets must be increased in length as compared with
the usual standard buckets.
Best conditions for the design prevail when Kt is between
2.5 and 3.5.
After the question of the number of wheels or nozzles has
been decided upon, the jet diameter will be found from formula
(5).
d (in inches) = 16.1 V H-Pi
where H-Pt is the power of one jet per foot of head, in horse-
power. The wheel diameter will be found from eq. (12).
At
which value must check with that given by eq. (9):
N
* A two-stage turbine for H, H-P, N requires runners of
Kt_ wv°*ii-p = , T n\'~7Tp
Thus, if a single-stage turbine has a runner of Kt = 12, the runners of a
two-stage turbine for the same total power, head and speed would be of
^t==^/"8"X 12 = 20.184. Or, if we consider 12 as the minimum value of
A't for radial inward-flow runners, we could, in using a two-stage turbine,
reach by radial inward-flow turbines a type characteristic as small as
12/1.682 = about 7.2.


Numerical Example.—Given # = 900 ft.; H-P = 7,500

sions of the turbine.

This value is too small for a radial inward-flow turbine and
too large for a single impulse-wheel. Choosing, therefore, one
wheel with two nozzles, or better, two wheels with one nozzle
each, Kt for each jet will be reduced to
V 2
which would require buckets of very careful design and some-
what elongated shape. On the other hand, if we decide to use
four jets, i. e., either four wheels each with one nozzle, or two
wheels each with two nozzles, then Kt per jet would be reduced to
Kt=-L23J_=3.SI7S
V 4
Both solutions are possible, and in deciding between them the
advantages and disadvantages of each should be carefully con-
sidered. The first solution will give us a smaller and cheaper
unit, but lower efficiency, whereas the second solution will give
us a considerably larger unit, which will cost more and require
more space in the power-house, but which will have better effi-
ciency.

Thus we see that the minimum possible angle ft is in direct

because the discharge loss increases with increasing /3.

The discharge loss varies as the square of the Type Charac-

as Kl varies, the shape of the buckets is altered so as to get in
each case the least discharge loss which can be obtained by using
a certain number of buckets (the number of buckets being re-
duced to that required in order that loss by imperfect reaction
may be zero up to A', = 5.0, and 2^% at Kt = 6). Assume
further that, at A't = 3 or D = i8d =45 ins., the wheel efficiency
is 85%, and that the loss due to bearing friction, resistance and
friction in the buckets remains unchanged. Then the following

THE MICHIGAN TECHN1C
The above-given theory may be somewhat academic, as the
angle /J is never made exactly equal to its minimum value but for
safety is made somewhat larger (in good standard buckets, for
not too high values of Kt, we find 3 about io°). Also we scarcely
would design a new bucket for each new value of Kt, but would
use the same bucket for different wheel-diameters. Nevertheless,
this theory and the curves in Fig. 6 will be reliable guides for the
turbine designer both in making efficiency guarantees and in
standardizing impulse-wheel buckets.


SMOKE WASHING.
Geo. E. Walus.
A series of tests have been conducted in the mechanical labora-
tories to investigate the possibilities of smoke washing when burn-
ing bituminous coals.
The agitation against the smoke nuisance in cities and thickly
populated districts has brought forth many patented smoke con-
sumers and schemes for eliminating smoke. All of these devices
are costly to install and operate, and only accomplish their purpose
when burning the coal at an average rate. A great many steam
plants have a short peak load during the day which necessitates a
high rate of combustion of the coal in order to carry the load.
The large amount of smoke produced during these short peak
loads suggested the smoke washing as a possible means of smoke
abatement.
The apparatus for these tests consisted of a sheet-iron flue or
breeching in which a number of spray nozzles were placed. By
the use of dampers, all of the gases from the boiler could be made
to pass through this experimental flue.
Two different liquids, water and ammonium hydroxide, were
used as a wash. A number of different nozzles were used varying
in design and in the amount of their discharge.
The following method was used to ascertain the effectivenesi
of the washing. A fire was started under the boiler and built up
to a greater thickness than would generally be used with the draft
which was maintained during the test. The object of this thick
fire was to make the conditions favorable to the production of
black smoke. When all of the conditions were steady, the tem-
perature in the uptake was taken and the height of the fire noted.
One hundred and fifty pounds of coal was then spread upon the
fire. The smoke and gases from this coal passed through the ex-
perimental flue, the spray nozzles being closed. Photographs of
the chimney were taken before and after firing as a basis on which
to compare the results of the washing. As soon as the fire had
burnt down to the same thickness as before firing, and the tern-


u.


f*5

perature in the uptake was the same as before, one hundred and
fifty pounds of coal was spread again upon the fire. At the same
time the spray nozzles in the washer were turned on and the gases
from the coal passed through the sprays.
The general results of the tests showed that there was little if
any improvement in the color of the smoke after being washed
with water or ammonium hydroxide. By the use of large quan-
tities of water the larger particles of carbon were removed, but
the finely divided carbon, which imports the color to smoke,
passed very easily through the sprays. The inability of the water
to grasp the finely divided carbon led to the belief that the small
particles might be surrounded by some such substance as tar.
Ammonium hydroxide was used in place of the water to break
down the supposed covering but there was no improvement in the
color of the smoke.
The temperatures taken in the experimental flue during the tests
showed a temperature reduction due to the sprays of from 50-
60%. In the case of natural draft this would cause a correspond-
ing drop in the draft pressure. The direct drop in pressure of
the draft due to the resistance offered by the spray was slight, and
with one style of nozzle the draft was slightly increased.
The quantity of water discharged by the nozzles varied from
1,000 to 8,500 pounds per hour, according to the design. The
ammonium hydroxide was made by dissolving 50 pounds of NH„
in 480 pounds of water. The rate of combustion on the grate was
about 22 pounds of coal per square foot of grate surface per hour.
The greatest ratio of water to coal by weight was forty to one.
Increasing the amount of water did not show a corresponding im-
provement in the appearance of the smoke.
The photographs taken during the test show in a relative way
the results of the washing. Number 1 was taken before and
Number 2 after firing, the spray nozzles being closed. Numbers
3 and 4 were taken before and after with the spray nozzles in
action.

BITUMINOUS ROAD BINDERS AND DUST PRE-
VENTIVES.
W. S. Wicker.
The following is an attempt to sum up the existing literature on
the use of bituminous materials as a solution for the problem of
road binding and dust prevention. The whole question of dust
prevention is still an experimental one and reliable data as to
methods and results are hard to obtain. In an article of this kind
it is only possible to call attention briefly to the main features of
the problem.
The attention which has of late years been given to the dust
problem has been due not only to the recognition of the danger
of spread of disease by dust but also to the rapid "raveling" of
water-bound macadam roads under the action of automobile traf-
fic.
Water as a binding material for roads has been a total failure.
The abrasive action of the tires and the shearing action or suction,
combined with the natural disintegrating agents, wind and water,
cause the rapid destruction of water-bound roads.
The dust which is formed by the above process is blown about
either onto occupants of vehicles or into residences on the road-
side. This nuisance, which is not only disagreeable but unsani-
tary has brought various materials into use as substitutes for
water. Efforts have been made to treat roads already built as
well as to improve the methods of new construction.
Roth non-bituminous and bituminous substances have been tried
as preventives and binders. Among the former are hygroscopic
salt solutions, vegetable oils, glutrine, wool scourings, sea water
and others. The bituminous materials which have been most suc-
cessfully used are products such as petroleum oils, asphalts and
tars.
In reviewing the subject of bituminous binders some idea will
be given of the physical and chemical properties of bituminous
binders, their production and availability for road use. Methods


of application to roads, costs and points to be considered in select-
ing binders will also be touched upon.
Bitumens are a mixture of hydro-carbons and their derivatives
which may be gaseous, liquid, a viscous liquid or solid. If solid
they are more or less readily melted when heated and are soluble
in chloroform or carbon bisulphide. Bitumens may be native or
artificial. Native bitumens are such materials as natural gas, pe-
troleum, asphalts, etc. Artificial bitumens are those which ap-
proximate the general charcter of native bitumens but are pro-
duced by destructive distillation of native bitumens or other or-
ganic substances, such as soft coal, wood, etc.
The chemistry of hydrocarbons is very complex and cannot be
taken up here. It may be pointed out, however, that some knowl-
edge of the various hydrocarbon series of which bitumens are
composed is necessary for a road engineer because the presence
of one or more of these hydrocarbons has a great deal to do with
the value of a bitumenous material as a binder or preventive.
These series vary, as to binding quality from the paraffin hydro-
carbons to the asphaltic hydrocarbons. The former are oily li-
quids or greasy solids and their presence in a bitumen is a detri-
ment as far as road use is concerned. The latter are of a sticky,
resinous nature and it is the asphaltic hydrocarbons which im-
part to a bituminous material its good binding qualities.
Having spoken of the properties of bitumens in general, they
may be classified. The best classification o£ bituminous mater-
ials used in road construction which has so far appeared is that
given by Frevost Hubbard in his ''Dust Preventives and Road
Binders." It is as follows:
(i) Petroleum, petroleum products and solid native bitumens.
(a) Crude paraffin petroleum.
Petroleum distillates.
Semi-asphaltic and asphaltic oils.
(b) Viscous, crude, semi-asphaltic and asphaltic oil res-
iduums.
(c) Very viscous and semi-solid, semi-asphaltic and as-
phaltic oil residuums or oil pitches.
Asphalts and other solid native bitumens.
(2) Tars and Tar Products.


(a) Crude water gas tars or oil gas tars.
Tar oils or distillates.
Emulsions containing tars.
(b) Crude coal tars.
Liquid tar residuums.
(c) Very viscous tar residuums.
Tar pitches.
The above substances may also be classified according to the
extent of their binding action. They may be (i) Temporary
binders, (2) semi-permanent binders, or (3) permanent binders.
The first must be considered as palliatives rather than preventives
as their binding action is very slight. The second have consider-
able binding action as well as dust laying qualities. The third are
purely binders and prevent dust only by prevention of the wear-
ing of the road surface. They do not take care of outside dust
unless additional treatment is given them by oiling. In consider-
ing various materials we will refer to them as one of the above
three classes.
In the first of the above classifications it will be seen that there
are two main divisions, viz.: Petroleum and petroleum products
and tar and tar products. These two classes of bituminous pro-
ducts will be considered as to production and availability as road
binders and dust preventives. Asphalts and other solid native
bitumens will not be considered.
Petroleum oils are fluid native bitumens widely distributed
over the earth. They may have a paraffin, semi-asphaltic or as-
phaltic base.
Large amounts of petroleum are produced in the United States,
chiefly from six fields, (1) Appalachian field, (2) Ohio-Indiana
field,'(3) Illinois field, (4) Mid-Continent field, (5) Gulf field,
and (6) California field. The first three produce entirely paraffin
oils. The fourth and fifth produce semi-asphaltic oils, while the
oil from the California field have a purely asphaltic base.
The paraffin oils are the most valuable from a commercial
point of view owing to their large content of illuminating oils.
They are of little value as road binders. The asphaltic oils are
however the most valuable from a road binding standpoint owing
to their content of heavy binding base. This fact will probably


THE MICHIGAN TECIINIC
cause asphaltic oils to continue in importance as dust preventives
and road binders for some time.
Crude oils have been used to a considerable extent as dust pre-
ventives. They are temporary or at best semi-permanent binders.
Their value depends on the amount of true binding base remain-
ing after the volatile constituents have evaporated. Oils which
have a high percentage of volatile hydrocarbon in them would thus
be poor as road binders because only a low per centage of binding
base would be left. The crude California oils have been most suc-
cessful because of their asphaltic nature. Crude oils in the east
have been tried but the results have been mostly failures. The
paraffin oils give a shiny, greasy mud which is bad for vehicles
and horses and also seems to disintegrate rather than bind the
road surface.
In the refining of crude oils two classes of products are formed,
viz.: distillates and residues. Distillates are formed by the cooling
of the gases driven off by distillation and are oily liquids. Resi-
dues are what remain in the still and are fluid, semi-fluid or
solid. Fluid residues are refined tars. Semi-solid and solid resi-
dues arc called soft or hard pitches.
The important thing to notice here is that the distillates are as
a rule not valuable as road binders. The residues invariably re-
tain the hydrocarbons which constitute the true binding base.
Distillates may be used as dust layers but have no value as per-
manent binders.
The petroleum distillates are of little value of themselves in
road work. They are at best only temporary binders. These
light oils are chiefly useful to cut very thick residues for use as
binders. Road oils so prepared are called "cut-back oils." A dis-
tillate used for this purpose should be sufficiently volatile to
leave only the residuum in place after application to the road. The
reason that distillates cannot be used as dust layers or binders is
that they are formed in that part of the refining process at which
the paraffin hydrocarbons arc distilled. Due to their paraffin con-
tent they form in wet weather a greasy mud which is very disa-
greeable.
It is the oil residuums which are of more importance as binders
than the distillates or crude oils. Thev have a lower volatilitv and


43
a higher specific gravity and hence give a very concentrated bind-
ing base. The residuums are fluid, semi-solid, and solid, as given
base contained. The semi-solid and solid residuums are strictly
in Hubbard's classification. The fluid residues may be temporary
or semi-permanent binders according to the amount of binding
permanent binders. They are not dust preventives except as they
prevent dust formation. They must be supplemented by treatment
with a more fluid residuum or a distillate for dust laying purposes.
Other petroleum products used in road work are blown oils and
oil emulsions. The former are usually semi-asphaltic residuums
blown with air which removes the water and thickens the resid-
uum to the proper degree of viscosity for road use. Blown oils
arc permanent binders. Oil emulsions are used largely in France
and Germany and are successful as dust preventives and semi-
permanent binders. They give a very good, smooth surface if
the proper oil is used but paraffin emulsions are open to the same
objections as paraffin distillates and residues.
The process known as cracking should be referred to before
leaving the discussion of petroleum products. It is resorted to in
order to increase the yield of illuminating oils. These lighter oils
are distilled off during the first part of the distillation. As soon
as the temperature of the still rises and the heavy oils also begin
to appear in the condenser the upper part of the still is made
cooler than the lower part and the heavy oils are condensed in the
upper part of the still and drop back into the hot lower part
where they break up into light oils and free carbon. It is the
deposition of this free carbon in the residue which injures it as a
binder. Asphaltic oils crack at lower temperatures than paraffin
oils and care should be taken in preparing an asphaltic residuum
for road work. The engineer should acquaint himself with the
temperature at which the residuum is produced and also make
tests for free carbon.
The second class of bituminous road materials is tar and tar
products. Tars arc artificial bitumens obtained from the destruc-
tive distillation of soft coal, petroleum, etc. and are named from
the product so distilled as coal-tar, oil-tar or wood-tar. Tars are
entirely different from petroleum products in chemical composi-
tion and contain different series of hvdro-carbons. The tars them-


selves are the liquid distillates obtained by cooling the gases driven
off in the distilling process. The crude tars are usually refined
for various purposes. Distillates and residues are formed as in
the refining of petroleum. The distillates are of little value as
road materials and it is the residues which invariably retain the
true, heavy, binding base.
Much more attention has been given to tar production abroad
than in this country. Tar in this country is produced chiefly in
the production of illuminating gas by the destructive distillation
of soft coal. In this case the residue is coke. Tar produced in
connection with the coke ovens has been almost entirely wasted in
this country contrary to foreign practice. This class of tars may
become more profitable with the increase of tarred roads.
The distillates produced in tar refining are oily liquids and are
used like the lighter oils of petroleum for cutting back the solid
residues. The fluid residues are the refined tars. These are dis-
tilled off and condensed leaving the solid residues or pitches. Dis-
tillates or tar-oils are merely temporary binders. The fluid resi-
dues are usually semi-permanent binders while the pitches form
permanent binders. No strict line can be drawn between the dif-
ferent classes because their binding action depends entirely on
the amount of binding base left on the road after the volatile con-
stituents have been evaporated. Tars used in -road work are us-
ually mixtures of crude tars, distillates, refined tars or pitches.
Little attention has been paid to the examination of tars used in
road work and they are all called merely tars. Many failures have
resulted from this practice.
Cracking in the still is practiced in refining tars as well as in
petroleum refining. If the volatile elements are driven off at high
temperature a deposition of free carbon will result.
The effect of free carbon may be shown by the following table:
Sample No I 2 3 4
Free Carbon 4 4&lt;jh 10.0% 20.096 31.09c
Binding strength at 250 C. Test 1 18* 7.5* 4* 3*
Binding strength at 250 C. Test 2 19* 8* 4* 3*
The above table should emphasize the necessity of a knowledge
of the chemical nature of bitumens used as binders.


45
The general properties and classification of bitumens have been
more or less generally treated. The methods of application to
roads will now be taken up. It is necessary to emphasize the fol-
lowing facts. (i) Materials used as binders and preventives do
not consist of any one class but are invariably mixtures and as
such vary widely in their characteristics. (2) Data as to methods
in use and results obtained are very uncertain due to carelessness
in making records and ignorance of the nature of the binders used.
(3) The work up to present time has been largely experimental,
and few roads have been in use long enough to be very sure of
their efficiency. Many of the methods of application of oils and
tars are similar. Light oils and tar distillates are applied by
sprinkling as they are fluid at ordinary temperatures. The solid
residues must be cut by light oils or heated to make them fluid.
There are three classes of roads to which binders are applied,
(a) Earth roads, (b) broken stone and gravel roads, (c) pave-
ments. The earth roads do not present a very resistant surface.
Up to date only the lighter oils have been used with success on
dirt roads. Tar and tar products are applied more especially to
gravel and broken stone roads. Pavements unless they have a
bituminous wearing surface are treated with temporary binders.
As has been said, the methods of applying bituminous binders
are varied. There are, however, two general methods. (1) Pen-
etration method, (2) Mixing method. These methods apply to
both oils and tars. It should be noted that tars have so far been
used with success mostly on roads presenting a hard surface such
as broken stone road. Oils on the other hand have been used on
sand, earth and gravel roads. The methods cited apply equally
well to oil and tar applications.
One distinction between the application of road oils and tars
is the fact that in applying oils it has not been thought necessary
to remove dust from the road surface unless it is very thick. The
dust is used to absorb the oil. Also, oiled roads are not rolled so
much. The sheep's-foot rolling tamper is much used because it
seems to compact the road from the bottom up, while tarred roads,
especially tar macadams, have received greater attention abroad,
oiled roads have been much more extensively used in this country.


This is due to the fact that as a rule European petroleums are not
suitable for road work.
The best results from oiled roads, especially oil-earth roads,
have been obtained in California. There the oils are asphaltic
and the roads are reported to present a smooth, hard surface sim-
ilar to asphalt pavement and to stand up well under traffic. The
use of Eastern oils with paraffin bases in an attempt to equal the
California results has resulted in numerous failures.
First consider the application of the lighter oils. These include
both crude and refined products which are liquid enough to be
applied at ordinary temperatures by sprinkling. Crude coal tars
are too viscous to be so used but crude water gas tars are used in
this way. 0.3 gal. per sq. yd. is about right for macadam. If the
road is very dusty more oil will be necessary. This method ought
not to cost more than 3c per sq. yd. per annum.
Next we have the heavier oils or semi-permanent binders. The
tar owing to its viscosity must be applied hot. The road is made
free from dust and should be dry. Warm weather is necessary
for best results. The road should be repaired and brought to
crown and grade some time previous to applying the tar. J.
Walker Smith gives as the best practice among English road
builders the following method of tarring or spraying old or new
surfaces.
1. Road should be in good condition or newly repaired.
2. Surface should be dry.
3. Surface should be swept clean.
4. Crude or refined tar should meet certain requirements.
5. Tar should be heated to 250' Fahr.
6. Should be applied by machine using compressed air (in-
creases penetration).
7- '4 to Yi gal. tar per sq. yd. should be used.
8. If properly done this road should not need retreating under
12 months.
The primitive method in use in this country is as follows: The
road is swept clear of dust and the hot tar is spread on and broom-
ed in by hand. If possible the road is allowed to remain untouched
for twelve hours. To do this one-half of the road may be treated
at a time but a patch in the center is usually the result. Screen-


47
ings are rolled in as a finish. Various equipments and machines
are used for spreading the tar. These are described by Prevost
Hubbard in his treatise, Dust Preventives and Road Binders,
Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1910.
The methods described above are for treating roads already
constructed. They are really penetration methods. Both the pen-
etration and mixing methods are used in new construction.
New construction by the Penetration Method is equally applica-
ble to oil or tar. The sub-grade is prepared as for ordinary mac-
adam, well rolled. A cover of No. 1 stone sizes 1% in. to 1^2 in.
is laid loose to a depth of 5 in. or 6 in. This is rolled with sand
or stone chips to a firm, fairly smooth surface. If the surface is
somewhat rough it is a good thing because it will key to the wear-
ing course. The second course is of crushed stone J/£ in. to \l/\
in. laid 2^/2 in. deep and rolled. Screenings are applied and the
surface is again rolled until there is not a great deal of move-
ment of the surface. The binder is then applied by hand or ma-
chine at a rate of 1 gal. to 1^2 gals, per sq. yd. This is allowed
to penetrate, after which stone chippings are rolled in. A flush
or sealing ccat of tar is now applied at a rate of .3 gal. to .5 gal.
per sq. yd. and a finish is given by fine dust to take up the surplus
tar. Various machines for performing this work are described
in the work quoted above. The disadvantages of the penetration
method are (1) a possible unevenness of distribution of the
binder, (2) lack of uniformity, (3) necessity of using a binder of
slighter consistency and viscosity than is possible in the mixing
method.
In the Mixing Method the lower course is the same as in the
penetration method. The wearing course is from 2 in. to 2]/^ in.
when finished and is composed of a carefully selected aggregate
which has been previously mixed and coated with bituminous
binder. It is preferably heated before mixing. The mixing is
done by hand or by machine as in Portland cement concrete. War-
ren Brothers bitulithic pavement is laid in the above way. They
had patents covering the selection of the aggregate which is done
with the idea of having the percentage of voids very low regard-
less of the amount of binder to be used. Both the penetration and
mixing methods may be employed in the resurfacing of old mac-


adam streets. The surface is scarified and harrowed and the tar
applied by either method.
In addition to the general methods used above there are several
methods which specify certain proprietary mixtures of tars, oils
and tar pitches. The chief of these preparations is Tarmac which
is used in England and Tarvia which is made in the United
States by the Barrett Mfg. Co. but which has found extensive ap-
plication both here and in England.
Tarmac is used by the mixing method and is used in connec-
tion with blast furnace slag. The slag is mixed hot with the tar,
using twelve to fifteen gals, of refined tar per ton of hot slag.
The objection is the structural weakness of slag.
The Gladwell system is an English system. It is a variation of
the mixing method and chiefly consists of embedding a two-stone
course of untarred clean, crushed stone in and between the layers
of tarviated, Y\" gauge, dustless stone chips, which form a ma-
trix. This matrix is worked by rolling into the spaces between
the crushed stone from below and above. A sealing coat of hot
Tarvia A and stone chippings finishes the road. This is of course
for new construction. The method may be applied more or less
rigidly to resurfacing.
Tarvia is used for all methods in this country. The Mass.
Highway Comm. in November, 1907, stated that the Tarvia treat-
ment was the best to date for surfacing of macadam roads. (Eng.
Rec. Nov. 23, 1907). Tarvia comes in three grades according
to specific gravity. Tarvia A being the heaviest is used hot, Tar-
via T) is fluid enough to be used at ordinary temperatures. J.
Walker Smith says that Tarvia is a good mixture but costs too
much. Ordinary coal gas tar cut with creosote oils is good
enough.
There are numerous variations of the above methods which
cannot he taken up here. Some examples of road work and cost
data will be given as reported from various localities. Attention
is again called to the fact that the tars and methods used vary
widely and that comparison is very difficult.
The matter of the cost of roads constructed or treated with
bituminous binders is very uncertain. Considerable data has been
published but the methods used vary so widely that cost compari-


sons are nearly impossible. The most reliable work done has been
in government experimental work at Ithaca, N. Y., Youngstown,
Ohio, and Bowling Green, Ky. These costs are published by the
U. S. Dept. of Agriculture. This work was new construction.
By the mixing method the cost averaged 50c per sq. yd. The pen-
etration method was more expensive, costing at Ithaca, 68c. The
surface treatment of roads by the Mass. Park Comni. of Boston
cost about 2C. per sq. yard using y2 gal. of tar per sq. yard. At
Newton, Mass., with the same amount of tar this method cost lie.
From this it will be seen that until some standard methods of con-
struction are adopted cost comparisons will be difficult.
• In connection with the application of tars and oils comes the
question of the selection of a proper material. Something has al-
ready been said of the need of care in this respect and these facts
should be summed up.
In selecting a road binder the engineer should become acquaint-
ed (1) with the local conditions as to traffic, climate, etc., (2)
with the method of application and (3) with the physical and
chemical properties of the material to be used.
Failure to do these things has been responsible for the lack of
results. A great deal of work has been done along this line but
reports of results are not valuable owing to lack of information
as to some of the essential factors of the problem.
In the first place the local conditions should be studied. The
type of road to be used affects considerably the manner of treat-
ment and choice of binder. Local conditions of climate and avail-
ability of materials should be next considered and this is often
extremely important as to cost and results as was seen in the case
of California earth roads. Local traffic conditions are of the ut-
most importance as certain roads have failed utterly under the
strain put upon them.
After examining local conditions the choice of binder to be
used may be made to fit conditions. The method of application
best suited to both requirements should then be chosen. The
choice of a binder is quite sure to be effected by considerations of
cost and the effectiveness of the construction hampered accord-
ingly.
It should be again noted that if dust prevention is the only ob-


THE MICHIGAN TECHN1C
ject of the improvement a temporary binder will perform this
work admirably but must not be expected to keep the road from
wearing' out. On the other hand a permanent binder effectually
reduces the wear on the road and prolongs its life but does not
lay the dust, except by reducing dust formation in the road itself.
To care for dust from external sources some additional treatment
with a temporary binder is necessary.
As to specifications and tests it must be admitted that owing to
the lack of definite knowledge on various phases of the subject,
and to the wide variance of methods used up to the present time,
it is difficult to prescribe definite specifications and tests. Methods
of testing bituminous road materials recommended by the Ameri-
can Society for testing materials are to be found in their report
for 1909. The methods proposed by the A. S. C. E. are printed
in their transactions for Sept., 1909. p. 343. Prevost Hubbard
suggests specifications on page 395 of his work on the subject.
In reviewing the subject of bituminous binders the writer has
felt the difficulty of treating so broad a subject briefly. The sub-
ject furnishes a wide field for investigation and a great deal is
yet to be learned. It might be well to emphasize once more the
need of detailed published reports by engineers as to materials,
methods, costs and results.
The writer acknowledges the use of material from Dust Pre-
ventives and Road Binders by Prevost Hubbard, from Dustless
Roads, Tar Macadam by J. Walker Smith. Several other author-
ities and current articles have been consulted for information as
to methods and costs.

'THE PITOT TUBE FOR MEASURING AIR."
T. C. Taylor. '08.
Tlie determination of the velocity and volume of air passing
through a pipe, jet. or nozzle may be arrived at by a number of
methods with varying degrees of accuracy. The Pitot Tube is
without question the most accurate measuring instrument and it
generally lends itself most easily to the work to be done. It
causes the least resistance to the flow of air of any measuring de-
vice, and is not affected in the least by radiation or heat losses
from the moving current.
The Pitot Tube Method of measuring velocity is fundament-
ally dependent upon that well known formula z'=\/2«/i. Pitot
Tubes have been made up in a great many forms and of very diff-
erent proportions and have given very different results. Exper-
iments made with many of the earlier forms of tubes showed that
the velocity could be correctly figured from the readings by the
use of the formula i'= K \l2. gh where K is a constant depending
on the form of the tube. A modern tube, such as is shown in the
accompanying drawing, has A" equal to unity.
This is the tube used by the American Blower Company. It
differs from that developed by the Navy Department of the United
States Government somewhat in proportions and also in the use
of small holes in each side instead of slots for obtaining the static
pressure of the air surrounding the tube.
The force with which a moving body impinges upon a station-
ary one is a function of its velocity. The impact pressure varies
as the square of the velocity; consequently, if the velocity is
doubled, the pressure becomes four times as great. If this force
is conveyed to a column of liquid in a manometer of the U-tube
type, it will cause a difference in elevation of the liquid in the two
legs. If the liquid used were air of the same density as that being
measured, the velocity in feet per second could be immediately
obtained by inserting in this formula for "h" the above elevation
in feet and for "g" the value of gravity (32.16 in the latitude of

New York. It is impracticable to use an air column, so water
is generally considered. The height of air column equivalent of
a given water column is inversely proportional to the relative
densities of the air and water. The weight of I cubic foot of water
at 68^ F. is 62.33 lbs. and is not changed to sufficient extent by
the usual temperature of water in the manometer to cause an ap-
preciable error in the velocity. The velocity in feet per minute
then resolves itself into the following:
y^-60 la x 32-16 X (£!3J) X *'
V=$o^ la X 32-16 X.f6l33\ X K
\ V W' 12
V = 1096.7 yn"/W where W is the weight of 1 Cu. Ft. of
the air being measured and h' and h" is the difference in level of
the water in the two legs of the U-tube in feet and inches respec-
tively.
Since a velocity of standard air of about 4000 feet per minute
is necessary to produce an elevation of \" of water, it becomes
necessary to provide means of magnifying the readings for the
lower velocities usually encountered. This is very effectively
brought about by a combination of two methods. In the first
place a liquid having a specific gravity less than that of water is
used. In the above formulae, "h"" water gauge equals the inches
of liquid substituted for water times the specific gravity of same.
Gasoline usually has a specific gravity varying from .68 to .73
and lends itself most readily, but Kerosene and a number of other
liquids are very good.
The second method consists of slanting the manometer. To
use this method, the manometer must be very carefully made;
tubes must be of the same diameter, very straight, in the same
plane, and parallel. The extent to which the readings are magni-
fied then is measured by the cosecant of the angle between the
plane of the two tubes and a horizontal plane, the tubes being at
right angles to the line of intersection of the two planes. Thus
if the mancmeter is at an angle of 30° with the horizontal plane,
the cosecant is two and the slant readings are twice the normal
values.


THE MICHIGAN TECH NIC
The above cut illustrates a manometer graduated to give read-
ings 2, 5, to, and 20 times the normal. This makes it perfectly
possible to make an accurate reading of pressures as small as
.001" water gauge. When using this latter method to measure
very small pressures, it becomes very necessary that liquids of
very low viscosity be used. Water becomes sluggish and sticks
to the tubes when the manometer is placed at an angle of less
than 300 with the horizontal. Gasoline is sensitive at any slope,
and because of this quality, may be used to level the instrument
when same is being set up.
When readings are being made, the Pitot Tube is so set that it
points in the direction from which the air is coming. The moving
air then impinges upon the air inside the open end and its pres-
sure is thus conveyed to the manometer. The round holes or slots
in the sides of the Pitot Tube are used to obtain the static pres-
sure in the pipe. The difference between the dynamic pressure
recorded at the end hole and the static pressure at the side holes


is the pressure due to velocity, and is determined by connecting
the tubes leading from each to opposite sides of the manometer.
When making air tests, it is generally of great importance to
know the total pressure of the air being measured above or be-
low atmosphere. If the static pressure in the pipe is greater than
atmospheric, it is very evident that the total pressure is the im-
pact or dynamic pressure measured at the tip of the tube. When
the static pressure in the pipe is less than atmospheric, the pres-
sure measured by the tip of the Pitot Tube is less than the total
suction pressure in the pipe by the amount of the velocity pres-
sure. The total pressure is then the pressure measured at the
static holes. In a pipe through which a fan is forcing air, the
dynamic pressure minus the velocity pressure or the static pres-
sure at any point represents the resistance loss from that point to
such a place as the air is allowed to escape freely into the atmos-
phere. In a pipe through which a fan is drawing air, the total or
static pressure at a point minus the velocity pressure likewise rep-
resents the resistance loss between that point and such a place as
the air is allowed to freely enter from the atmosphere.
The average total pressure at any cross sectional plane through
a pipe differs from that at any similar plane only by an amount
equal to the frictional resistance loss from one to the other. The
velocity pressure at both planes will be the same if the cross sec-
tional area is the same, and if not, will vary inversely as the
square of the above areas. When the pessure in the pipe is great-
er than atmospheric the Static Pressure is equal to the difference
between the Dynamic Pressure and the Velocity Pressure; when
less than atmospheric it is equal to the sum.
A conical piece of pipe will convert Static Pressure to Veloc-
ity Pressure or vice versa. If properly made with sides at an an-
gle with the axis not to exceed io°, the friction loss in this noz-
zle is negligible. This leads us to a test often necessary and con-
veniently made with a modification of the Pitot Tube. Let us
assume as an example that we wish to test a fan which is required
to deliver 30,000 Cu. Ft. of air per minute (weight .0731 lb. per
cubic foot) through a piping system estimated to have a resist-
ance loss of 1" Static Pressure. The fan outlet 44" diameter has
an area of 1520 square inches or 10.55 square feet. The velocity


through the fan outlet equals 30,000/10.55, or 2845 feet per min-
ute.
V= 1096.7 V/»7W
2845 = 1096.7Vh" /. 0731 = 4050V/1"
h" =: .493" water gauge = Velocity Pressure at the fan
outlet.
Total Pressure = .Static Pressure -\- Velocity Pressure.
Total Pressure = i"-f .493" = 1.493" water gauge, total pressure at
the fan outlet or large end of the cone.
The same pressure will exist at the small end of the cone;
but since at this point it passes into the atmosphere, it has no
Static Pressure. The Total Pressure then equals the Velocity
Pressure or h" = 1.493".
V = 4050V h" =4950' per minute velocity of air through
small end of cone.
30,000/4.950 = 6.06 sq. ft. =; 873 sp. in. area of the small end of cone.
873/3-1416 — r2 — 278.
d = 2r = 2 X 16.67" = 33-34" diameter of the small end of
cone.
The total pressure is 1.493" at every point in the cone from
the fan outlet to the small end. This is the only pressure which
we need to know to determine the volume handled or Total Pres-
sure against which the fan is working. This pressure is measured
with the tip of the Pitot Tube and no static holes are necessary.
Therefore, we can use for a Pitot Tube a piece of tubing or pipe
sharpened at one end.
Standard fan tests are generally made using a pipe of a length
equal to 20 times its diameter. A disc on the end of the pipe is
used for restriction. The Pitot Tube is let into the pipe through
a small hole % of the distance from the fan to the disc. When
making readings on a system already installed, it is seldom possi-
ble to even approach the conditions set for a standard fan test.
In such cases, it is well to pick out the longest section of straight
pipe possible without getting too far from the fan. An obstruc-
tion or elbow in the pipe affects the air coming toward it. For
this reason, the Pitot Tube should be placed considerably nearer
to the second obstruction which the air must encounter than to the
first.
Due to the fact that the velocity at various points in the sec-
tion through a pipe differs considerably, it becomes necessary to
take readings at a number of places and average these to obtain


the true average pressure and consequent approximate average
velocity of air through the pipe. The true average velocity of the
air could be obtained by obtaining the velocity due to each pres-
sure reading and averaging the velocities, but this is a long pro-
cess. The error due to the first method is insignificant when the
maximum and minimum pressures are not very different. When
the maximum velocity pressure in one section is equal to twice
the minimum, the error equals 1.5 per cent; when three times
the minimum, 3.4 per cent.
No rule can be given as to the locations of the tube for read-
ings in a pipe of rectangular cross section which will give a strict-
ly accurate average pressure for the section. It is generally con-
sidered to be sufficiently accurate to divide the section into a num-
ber of rectangles and take readings in the center of each. In the
case of a round pipe, the area should be divided by a number of
concentric circles into rings of equal area. Readings are taken
at points across the pipe midway between the successive circles,
thus making two readings for each ring.
Having determined the volume of air in Cubic Feet per Min-
ute from the velocity in Feet per Minute and the cross sectional
area of the pipe in square feet, the Horse Power in the blast is
readily obtained. Starting with the formula:

THE SELECTION AND PURCHASING OF COAL.
S. L. Mudge.
To every plant owner or manager the question of the best
coal and how to secure it, is of vital interest. We find a great
difference of opinion on this subject among coal users. One man
will buy whatever coal is cheapest per ton regardless of its heat
value, while another will insist on having a certain grade of coal
regardless of its price. It is the purpose of this article to discuss
the properties of coal which determine its value to the consumer
and to show how best to secure these properties by contract.
There are in use two simple methods of analyzing coal. The
first, known as the "Proximate Analysis," is to determine the per-
centage by weight of water, volatile matter, carbon and ash in
the coal. Separate analyses for sulphur and iron are often made.
The second method is to determine by actual combustion the num-
ber of heat units per pound of coal. As will be seen later, neither
of these analyes alone are a sure guide to the quality of the coal.
The main heat-giving elements of coal are the carbon and the vol-
atile matter. Volatile matter is made up of different hydro-carbon
gases. It is the fact that these hydrocarbons vary in composition
that renders a proximate analysis an uncertain indicator of coal
value. Sulphur gives some heat, but is a detriment since it cor-
rodes and forms clinker. Moisture is a detriment since it reduces
the percentage of combustible and also carries away some heat in
the stack gases. Ash is a detriment since it reduces the percent-
age of combustible and necessitates cleaning the fire. Iron is a
detriment since it produces a very hard clinker. Coals are di-
vided into three classes according to the proportion of their vol-
atile matter.
T. Hard or Anthracite coal contains less than 8% volatile
matter.
II. Semi Bituminous coal contains less than 20% volatile
matter.
I IT. Bituminous, or soft coal contains more than 20% vol-
atile matter.


Classes II. and III. are also divided into caking and free burn-
ing coals. Caking coals are those which tend to fuse together
while burning.
If boiler and grate efficiencies remained constant for different
grades of coal, that coal would be cheapest which contained the
greatest number of heat-units per dollar's worth. Unfortunately
however, efficiencies vary with the kind of coal used. They will
decrease with an increase of volatile matter since some of the
hydro-carbons are apt to escape without burning. They will de-
crease also with an increase of ash and clinker since the fire door
must be kept open longer for cleaning. This variation of effic-
iencies is also dependent upon the design of the boiler furnaces.
If the furnace is of good design with a large combustion cham-
ber and a fire brick arch there will be only a slight falling off of
efficiency with an increase of volatile matter. Good automatic
stokers or expert firemen will help to decrease this loss. If the
heating surfaces are placed close to the fire this loss will be very
marked. From the foregoing it will be seen that of two coals with
the same calorific analysis that one will be most valuable which
contains the least volatile matter and ash. The extent of super-
iority of one coal over the other will be determined by the nature
of the plant.
The manager, in contracting for his coal, is confronted with
two problems. He must first determine what is the cheapest coal
to use. and must then so draw up his contract as to secure this
coal as cheaply as possible.
The first problem may generally be solved by a careful con-
sideration of proximate and calorific analyses and market prices.
Since freight is one of the main factors in the price of coal it is
generally true that the coal mined nearest the plant will be the
cheapest to use. Especially is this true if the furnace design'is
of the best. If smokelessness is of importance and the furnace
of standard construction, coal with a volatile content of over twen-
ty per cent should not be used. In some localities the only sure
way to select a coal is to make boiler tests with each kind under
consideration. If such tests are made care should be taken to
see that plant conditions are adhered to, and that enough tests
are run to fully acquaint the fireman with each kind of coal.


Often a coal will show up poorly due to ignorance or prejudice
on the part of the fireman. It is almost needless to say that that
coal is best which will evaporate the greatest quantity of water
per dollar's worth, provided that the boiler room labor is not
greatly increased and that the boilers will be able to earn.' any
load required of them.
Having determined upon the best type of coal, the next step
is so to draw up the contract as to make sure of getting it as
cheaply as possible. One way is to specify in the contract from
what mine the coal is to be taken. This method is open to the
objection that coal from the same mine often varies greatly in
composition. This is especially true of the ash content. Another
objection is that, unless the coal is shipped direct from the mine
to the consumer, there is no check on the honesty of the dealer.
A better method is to specify the desired proximate and calorific
analysis and to refuse all deliveries that fall below these values.
If a flat rate is paid the proximate analysis is generally considered
sufficient. If there is a bonus and penalty clause, for coal that
shows better or worse than the specifications, it is advisable to
include a calorific determination. Calorific analysis alone, how-
ever, is not a proper basis for purchasing. Probably the best
form of contract for both buyer and seller is one which specifies
the acceptable proximate analysis and determines the price on
the heat unit basis. The usual bonus is between one and three
cents per ton for every hundred heat units per pound. This basis
would make a coal of 14,000 B.T.U's. quality cost from $1.40 to
$4.20 per ton. It is generally true that companies selling coal on
a heat unit basis are very careful that the coal delivered be above
the specifications so as to earn a bonus on the contract price. For
this reason the purchaser should be careful to see that the bonus
is slightly less than the value of the extra heat units. If this is
adhered to both contractor and consumer will be making a profit
on the high test coals.
There are three ways of expressing the heat value of coal:
1st. B.T.U's. per lb. of wet coal.
2nd. B.T.U's. per lb. of dry coal.
3rd. B.T.U's. per lb. of combustible.


The first is the most logical since it is the wet coal which is
actually bought.
The second method varies only slightly from the first and is
frequently used.
The third method is not a safe one to base a contract on unless
there is also a very strict specification in regard to ash. This
method is satisfactory provided there is a bonus and penalty
clause for ash, but even so, has no advantages over the other
two. In very large contracts, or where the supply of the desired
coal is uncertain, there are often included penalties for exceed-
ing certain values in the proximate analysis. These penalties
vary of course with the price of coal but will be found somewhere
near the following values:
For each i per cent of volatile matter above the specified value
—4 to 5 cents per ton.
For each i per cent of ash above the specified value—4 to 5
cents per ton.
For each 1 per cent of sulphur above the specified. value—
8 to 10 cents per ton.
Contracts for hard coal should contain specifications as to size.
With soft coal this is of little value. Most soft coals break easily
and some are so rotten that any system of sifting, to determine
size, is out of the question. Fineness in soft coal becomes ob-
jectionable only when it is so extreme as to be classed as dust.
Coal with much dust in it should be rejected.
It is generally sufficient to make one analysis for each car or
boat load delivered to the plant. If unloading is done by hand a
shovelful of coal should be set aside for each two or three feet of
length unloaded. At the end of unloading the sample should be
quartered and crushed until about two lbs. are left. This should
be sealed in a glass jar and kept for analysis. If the plant is
equipped with dumping scales they can be arranged to collect a
small sample from each load dumped.
With well arranged apparatus, a complete proximate and cal-
orific analysis requires about two hours' work. The work is of a
routine nature, the only skill required being exactness in weigh-
ing and reading instruments. Many laboratories throughout the
country make a specialty of coal determinations and can do the


work much better, and often as cheaply, as the purchaser. The
expense of analysis is borne by the consumer except in case of the
first analysis being questioned. The contract generally provides
that if the contractor doubts the first analysis he may order a sec-
ond one made by some chemist satisfactory to both parties. The
expense of this analysis is borne by the party in error.
In drawing up specifications for a coal contract it must be
kept in mind that needless restrictions are apt to result in a higher
bid. It is best before asking for bids to secure from each dealer
an average proximate and calorific analysis of his coal. If these
analyses do not approximate those desired the dealer should not
be asked to bid. If a contractor makes a bid which it will be
difficult to live up to, it will result in a higher price and a contin-
ual rejection of coal. This will be unsatisfactory to both parties.
It is probable that this system of contracting will not pay for
plants which use less than one thousand tons per year but above
this figure it should prove valuable to both contractor and con-
sumer.


EDITORIALS
This issue of The Technic contains the third and last of Pro-
fessor Zowski's series of articles on Water Turbine theory. Re-
prints of the three articles have been made and bound together
under one cover, and are now offered for sale by the Engineering
Society of the University of Michigan at seventy-five cents per
copy.
There will be a third issue of The Technic this year. It is
the first time in the history of The Technic that more than two
issues have been published. While the venture is easily enough
successful in the way of copy, the Board have found it difficult
to make it a financial success.
The Technic is now the only publication on the Campus,
managed by students, which is not under the direction of the
Board in Control of Student Publications. It has thus far been
managed independently and we hope that it may continue so, and
we wish to ask that every reader help us when he can by patron-
izing our advertisers.

THE COMPOSITION AND RESOLUTION OF STRESSES.
j. h. griffith.
Introductory.
The fundamental theory of the composition and resolution of
stresses is an important one in the training of those who are to
apportion material or to design structures. Of the several meth-
ods heretofore in vogue, two are of especial value to the engineer
in his routine practice. One of these is based upon the well known
principle of the ellipse of stress, an ingenious device of Rankine


in which, taking the geometrical addition of the half sum and half
difference of stresses wholly normal to certain planes at right an-
gles, he is enabled to express the value of the resultant stress in
both magnitude and direction on any plane inclined to these at a
given angle, as the radius vector of his ellipse, the planes being
perpendicular to a common third plane. In the applications of
his method, the inverse problem is usually presented, i.e., given
the shears and normal stresses on certain planes at right angles,
what are the so-called "principal stresses" or those wholly normal
to other planes.
The Rankine method is a popular one among engineers, and
has been the standard treatment in the elementary analysis of
earth pressures as applied to retaining walls. It is not only val-
uable as a graphical treatment, but is also susceptible of easy me-
chanical adaptation to ellipsographs of stress.
The other method is analytical in its scope, and involves a dis-
cussion of the so-called tetrahedron of stress. It is the older and
more general procedure but on account of its analytical nature
has not commended itself to practical men. Engineers who dis-
cuss stress analyses before the engineering societies must usually
resort to copious appendices to elucidate the most elementary of
propositions. On account of the utility of the analytical treatment
and its ready adaptation to slide rule process, it should be consid-
ered as a natural supplement to the Rankine graphical treatment.
The writer purposes in this paper to review some of the element-
ary propositions of stress analysis, and to collect certain scattered
data with a view to showing their more or less systematic applica-
tion to standard elementary problems often occurring in practice.
Some Definitions.
One is led to believe by certain recent writers, notably Pro-
fessor Crew and Mr. Coffin, that stress is a vector quantity, and
it may doubtless be thus interpreted. But more consistently by
resultant stress at a point is meant a quantity which is defined by
nine components in the direction of chosen coordinate axes, six
of these being independent on account of Cauchy's law of the
equality of shears at right angles. These components may be
called the constituents of the stress.


When these constituents are constant from point to point in a
structure, as for example in the well known case of a bridge eye
bar under longitudinal forces, the stress is said to be uniform or
homogeneous. When, however, they vary from point to point, as
in the case of the superposed system where the eye bar is subject
to its own weight, the stress is non-uniform or heterogeneous.
This latter may be assumed as homogeneous in the vicinity of a
point, for practical purposes.
Notations for Stress at a Point.
A stenophrenic representation of stress is essential in any an-
alysis. Every engineer is aware of the peculiar efficiency of
Bow's notation in graphic statics, how it conveys automatically
to the mind the requisite data of the various members with an
economy of effort. Many worthy attempts have been made to
perfect a notation for stress which should also be mechanical, re-
sulting in the following, viz., the de St. Venant, txx, tyy, f2„ txy,
txz, tyz; the Lame, Nv N2, Nt, Tly T„, T3; the Kelvin, P,Q,R,
S,T.U; the Townsend, A, B, C, F,G,H\ the Pearson, aa, fifi, yy,
py, ya, a/8; and others, where the first three terms of a group sig-
nify normal constituents and the latter three the shears.
Kirchhoff's Notation.1
Kirchhoff invented a single suffix notation which, in the words
of Christiansen (Copenhagen), "exhibits more clearly than any
other the true significance of the quantities involved," being to
stress what Bow:s notation is to frame works. The general adop-
tion of this notation will conduce to uniformity among writers on
the Mechanics of Materials.
By way of illustration and introduction it will be easiest first to
take up those analyses which are confined to a plane, uniplanar or
two dimensional stress so-called, as these cases occur more often
in engineering, as in the common theory of the beam or truss.
Actual problems in three dimensions are usually reduced to the
other by certain assumptions of symmetry about a plane.
Conceive two planes, say in a beam, which are parallel to
chosen coordinate axes (see figure i) and let the shears and nor-

inal stresses be given on these two planes respectively. These
stresses are functions of the space coordinates (x, y). For ex-
ample, in this case the only force to left being the end reaction,
the vertical stress at (x, y) is zero, the horizontal stress is Rxy/l
and the shears are R/Iz y'\ y z dy, in the common theory, where
R is the end reaction, 1 the moment of inertia of vertical cross
section at (x, y), z the width and j !'i ys dy the statical moment
of area of beam above y.
Kirchhoff called the plane whose normal points in the positive
direction of the x axis the plane x. The normal stress on this is
Xx, where the capital indicates the stress and its direction and
the suffix the plane. Similarly the shear on the .r plane is Yx.
The vertical stress on the plane at right angles is accordingly Yr
and the shear A',. As the shears occur in pairs Xy = Yx.
Having given a suitable notation for stresses near the point
(x, y) one is next concerned with the stress on some plane a—a
through (x, y) inclined to the beam axis. By analogy with the
preceding it is convenient to let this plane be defined by its
normal n. This normal is fixed in direction with the x and y
axes by direction angles say nx and ny (see figure 2). The re-
sultant stress on the plane n may be called R„, that is the stress
pointing in the direction of r on the plane n defined by its normal.
.Again the angle of obliquity of R„ with the normal n may be
called nr and the direction angles of Rn are rx and ry respectively.
The relation between these angles from solid geometry is
cos nr = cos rx cos nx -\~ cos ry cos ny
The above stress constituents are given on a wedge and are as-
sumed homogeneous. For heterogeneous stress in the limiting
case to obtain the constituents at (x, y) this wedge is assumed
contracted to zero, and the constituents then define the stress at
the point (x, y).2
2 It would be more logical to select two sets of axes, .r.y, ~. and x',y',s',
and refer the stresses to these having Xv Yy, etc., and X'x, Y'Y, etc. as the
constituents. The writer has found the notation given quite as efficient
for practical usage and there is less liability to error and confusion of
terms in equations.


A notation is tedious of explanation, but having once learned
a good notation, it may usually be almost dispensed with, as the
data easily formulates itself mentally, which is the great desider-
atum.
In the analysis the writer has taken all constituents to the right
of the plane and compounded for the resultant, rather than to con-
sider the equilibrium of the wedge for the equal and opposite
anti-resultant or equilibrant.
Value of the Resultant Stress.
The resultant stress is easily expressed in terms of the constit-
uents in the following manner. Call for convenience the « plane
unity, then the other planes x and y are respectively equal to
cos nx and cos ny. The areas may be considered as weights which
attach to the stresses so that they may be considered as forces and
subject to the laws of vectors. Referring to Figure 2 by taking
2 X --— 5 Y = o there results
Xa = Xx cos nx + Xy cos ny
Yn = Kx cos nx 4- Yy cos ny
where Xn and }7„ are the x and y components of the resultant
stress on the plane n respectively. Accordingly the resultant is
V (XZ cos nx -\- X cos ny)'1 + (¥~x cos nx -t- Y cos ny)-
where in a similar manner Rn is the resultant stress on the plane
whose normal is n. The angle rx which Ra makes with the x axis
is rx = tan"1 Yu/Xa. The cosine of angle of obliquity is
cos nr = cos nx cos rx + cos ny cos ry
Example for Illustration.
A common use of the above is in designing the rivets for a
spiral riveted pipe, and similar cases. Take for example3 a stand
pipe 25 feet dia. X no feet high, filled with water and subjected
to a wind pressure of 40 lbs. per sq. foot on one half the projec-
tion of its semi-cylindrical surface. Suppose a riveted joint is to

that this is 30° slope from the vertical. If the plates vary from
Yi" thick at the joint to %" at the top, what is the pitch of the
rivets?
Here the stresses are due to the weight of steel, the hoop ten-
sion from water pressure and the normal stresses from wind
causing its maximum bending effect. An alternative case arises
when the wind acts at right angles to first direction causing pure
shears. There results:
Weight of steel = — ft" "I" #" X 3'4 X IO° = — 219 pds. per sq. in.

lbs. per sq. in.
6450 lbs. per sq. in. = 6450 X % = 5630 lbs. per lineal
inch. A 1" rivet at 10000 safe shear in lbs. per square inch yields
7854 lbs. per rivet. Hence the pitch is 7854/5630= 1.4 inches,
which requires 2 rows of rivets spaced approximately 3 inches
apart. It would have been simpler to have gotten the constituents
in pounds per lineal inch instead of pounds per square inch in the
way of quick computation.
In the case when the wind is parallel in direction to the plane of
the joint instead of perpendicular as in the preceding case, the
joint being on the neutral plane of the shell, the normal wind
stresses vanish and pure shears occur at the joint. Professor
Greene's rule for a shell (Struc. Mech., p. 67) gives 100% greater
than the mean shear over the section. This pure shear then is
the force of wind divided by area of shell times two =

Principal Stresses.
The Rankine inverse procedure has always seemed deficient to
the writer as a computer's device in obtaining what are called
principal stresses or those purely normal to certain planes. Inas-
much as many engineers hold to the theory that rupture is more
liable to occur in the direction of the maximum principal stress it
becomes important to readily obtain these. i?„ may be considered
to have a normal component iVn and a tangential component or
shear Tn on the plane n (see figure 2). In the case when the
obliquity of Rn becomes zero Tn will vanish and Nn becomes pure-
ly normal to some plane. Upon this assumption resolving forces
in .r and y directions there results
(Xa =:) Na cos nx = Xx cos nx + Xy cos ny
(Yn =) NB cos ny = Yx cos nx + Y cos ny
Multiplying one by the other and arranging terms the cosine
products will cancel and
(XX-NB) (Y,-NB)=XJYX
which may be put in the convenient determinant form
'

-A'.
Remembering the symmetry of the system

one need
only think of the determinate relation and place —Na after the
normal stresses as a convenient mnemonic relation to have in mind
when principal stresses are desired. The values of A'n may also
be expressed directly, solving the quadratic, by the following for-
mulae for half sum and half difference of normal constituents.

where primes are used to distinguish the two solutions of the
quadratic equation. These equations give the ordinary formulae
for a shaft under combined bending and torsion if Y7, the normal


constituent transverse to the shaft vanishes (see Structural Me-
chanics, p. 85) as in the common theory.
To get the angle of inclination of the planes on which the pure
normal stresses occur, insert the particular value of Nn whose
plane is desired in either of the equilibrium cosine equations to-
gether with the given constituents and solve for the tangent.
This is more conveniently remembered by the determinant rela-
tion. The rule becomes
tan n x =
Xx — Nr, _ V,
f

or — tan nx = first term of either row divided by the second
term. The angle of inclination
owing to the fact that Aa has two values, has also two values
which fix four planes, the planes of wholly normal stress.
Problem Illustrating.

per sq. in. and a tensile stress, due to the contraction of the rivet
in cooling, of 6000 lbs. per sq. in. Find the principal stresses.

Check Relations.
In the preceding quadratic the invariants, or terms which are
unaltered hy any change of rectangular axes through the same
origin, are
Xs+Y, = Nn + N'n.
and the determinant
Xx X,
&gt;'&gt;■

and these afford a quick check upon the work.
In the preceding problem of the rivet the sum of the normal
constituents will equal the sum of principal stresses as
6 + 0=11.54 — 5.54, also
0X6 — 8X8 = — 11.54 X 5-54-
Maximum Shears.
To determine the plane on which the shear is a maximum one
may proceed in a somewhat similar manner as before or more
directly resolve forces in direction of the plane n on which the
shear is desired, assuming that the principal stresses have been
found and are Yy and Xx. There results
Tn = (Xx — Yy)cos nx cos ny = J4 (Xx — }'}.) sin 2 nx.
Differentiating with respect to nx for a maximum there re-
sults nx = ± 450. Hence the magnitude of the maximum shear
is equal to the half difference of the principal stresses and the di-
rection of the planes bisects the angle between them, two planes
resulting as would be expected from symmetry about either axis.
PURE SHEARS.
On some plane subject to shear the normal stress will vanish.
That this may occur the projections of the weighted principal
stresses on the normal to the plane must be equal and of opposite
sign.

MAXIMUM OBLIQUITY FOR A CERTAIN MEDIUM,
The maximum obliquity of Rn at a point is an important one
in the theory of earth pressure. The normal and tangential com-
ponents of i?n are N0 and Tn, or r„ = A"ntan nr, where Jir is the
obliquity of the resultant stress measured from the normal. In
the theory of pulverulent media, using the proper term from
Boussinesq, the force T„ is the friction per unit of area induced by
the normal pressure A'„. Engineers have measured experimental-
ly the ratio Tn/NB and call it the coefficient of internal friction,
or the tangent of the angle of friction, etc. This angle of obli-
quity cannot be exceeded or failure, i. c, motion of particles oc-
curs. Most engineers seek to associate this with the so-called
angle of repose, i. c, the angle of slope or surface talus which the
material will assume after indefinite weathering. Rankine based
his theory upon the rather doubtful assumption that &lt;j&gt; = nrmlx will
♦ake simultaneous maximum values throughout the medium when
the particles are at the point of incipient motion, justifying this
through Moseley's principle of "least resistance." He neglected
to provide for other possible values of &lt;f&gt; and neglected also to
provide for the idea of strain. Many of the Rankine deficiencies
have since been supplied by the more modern theories of Bous-
sinesq, Kotter, Jean Resal and others. Nevertheless the theory
represents one of the limiting aspects which will always play an
important part in earthwork analysis.
Let Yy = the stress due to the vertical weight of soil, foun-
dations, etc.. as the case may be. Required to find Xx the lateral
pressure (see figure 4). Rankine neglected cohesion assuming
all stresses negative or compressions. Accordingly there results
for an indefinite value of Xx = f(Yy)
,. tan nx .,

Finding the maximum and minimum values of

there results then for the particular values of planes upon which
slipping may be expected to occur
nx = multiples of v/4 — &lt;f&gt;/2, for Xx a maximum.
nx = multiples of 3ir/4 — &lt;f&gt;/2, for Xx a minimum

for positive values of &lt;£, and in a similar manner when &lt;f&gt; is neg-
ative; &lt;f&gt; representing the maximum ± value of the obliquity = nr,
the value as used by Rankine. For example taking a common
assumption of &lt;£ = 30°, one receives A'x = 1/3 Yy and 3 Yy as in
the ordinary case.
THE ELLIPSE OF STRESS.
The ellipse of stress is a superfluous adjunct from other than
an academic standpoint. Its chief value is in analysis.
The writer will illustrate, however, the simplicity of handling
Rankine*s ellipse by an example. Suppose two principal stresses
-f- 2 and -f- 4 are given. Required the radius vector representing
the stress upon any chosen plane whose normal is n. Referring
I forcp i
to figure 5, the components of the resultant -. - , Rn, are
Xx cos nx and Y cos ny; 1. e.,
Rn — V (A'x cos nx)» + ( Y, cos )/y) -
and the angle it makes with the x axis is
rx = « = tan -&gt;«.r Xv^Ly"
A cor xn
The plane on which it acts has the direction angles nx and ny.
Take for example nx and ny = 20° and 70° respectively. Rn be-
comes V(4 X 0.94)2 + (2 X o.342)a = 3.84 and
0= (2 X 0.34) (4 X 0.94) = tan"1 0.1808= io°-3o'
Again taking nx and ny = yo° and 200. R„ becomes
V(4 X 0.342)-' + (2 X 0.94)* = 2.32 and
tf^tan-1 (2X0.94) (4 X 0.342)= tair1 1.37=^ 53°-5o'.
These values of Rn are radii vectorcs of the ellipse and agree with
Rankine's method for the same numerical case.
THREE DIMENSIONAL CASES.
In the case of three dimensions the Rankine method while
possible is impracticable. In fact the distinguished savant and his
votaries usually dismiss this part of the subject with a sentence
or two. The inverse Rankine method for three dimensions would
form an interesting publication.
The preceding methods easily generalize, however, for the


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
tetrahedron of stress (see figure 6). In the figure the writer has
taken the equilibrant rather than the resultant stress merely to
avoid confusion in drawing the diagram. The inclined or n plane
as before is defined by the direction angles of its normal nx, ny,
ns. Its area is conveniently taken as unity. The resultant ,
upon the n plane is Rn. Its direction angles are rx, ry, rz. The
angle of its obliquity with the normal is nr. The cosine of this is
cos nr = cos nx cos rx + cos ny cos ry -f- cos nz cos rz.
Figure 7.

Figure 8
The x plane or one perpendicular to the x axis has the area
cos nx, the y and z planes cos ny and cos nz respectively, these
being merely the components of the plane n of area unity when
it is projected upon the x, y, and z axes respectively.

Resolving parallel to the x, y and z directions there results
5^ = 0 gives Xn = Xx cos n.v + Xy cos ny + Xz cos nz
%Y = 0 gives Yn = Yx cos nx + Yy cos ny + y, cos nz
JZ = o gives 2Tn = Zx cos fur + Zy cos Mi' + ^i cos "~
.'. Ra=yX\+Y\ + Z\
where the above values are to be substituted for XB, Ya and Zn.
The principal stresses are easily solved by remembering the
determinant relation; or the cubic equation for Nn, N'n\ N"a"
becomes the determinant of figure 7, where the three group prod-
ucts taken to the right have the plus sign to each term and the
three to the left the minus sign. The first two rows of the third
order determinant may be mentally repeated (not general) and
the products taken as shown on the right, a rule due to Sarrus.
If the determinant be expanded there results
(Xx-Nn) (.Yy-NB) (Zz-Nn)+ZyYzZx + XzZyYx-ZxXx(Yy-Nn)
- YxXy {Zz - NJ -ZyYz (Xx_ ,Vn) = o
which may be put in the form
N\-(Xt+ Y7+Zm)N\+(, XxYy + XxZz+YyZz-X*,-Z*-Y*I) Na
+ (XxYyZz + XyYzZx + XzYzZy-XzYyZx-XxYtZy-ZzYxXy) =0
The coefficients of the terms in N are unaltered by orthogonal
transformations, i. e., the stress does not depend on any chosen
system of axes. Accordingly they are invariants and may be
used as before as a convenient check on the work after the cubic
is solved.
For convenience these invariants may be put in the following
form for remembering.
(Xx + Yy + Zz) = (iVn + 2V'0,+ #"„„) — constant or sum of the prin-
cipal stresses.

where the symmetry with the equilibrium equations becomes ap-
parent. If certain constituents are zero the terms containing them
vanish, the two dimensional treatment being a special case.
This cubic is easily solved. The busy engineer will not re-
member how to handle the cubic. He may resort to the method
of trial using his slide rule as follows to obtain one root. Put the
coefficients in their simplest numerical form. Inspecting the con-
stituents X*, Yy, etc., which are given values, make a good guess
at the principal stress. Set I of the slide opposite this guess = JV-
on the lower scale. Read N's on the upper scale, N2g times its co-
efficient also on the upper scale, Ng times its coefficient on the
lower scale, all at one setting, and add to the absolute term. For
the correct value of the root the f (Ne) should equal zero. It
will not on the first trial but after two or three settings he can
estimate by mental interpolation and set the rule so as to satisfy
very closely. Having one root divide by Ar minus this root and
get a quadratic which may be solved giving the other principal
stresses.
INVERSE PROBLEM.
Suppose pure normal stresses are given to find the constituents
parallel to a chosen system of coordinate axes. This is easily done
by again considering the equilibrium of the tetrahedron. • Let A'j,
N„ and Ar3 be the principal stresses. Let their direction cosines be
as given in the following table:
x y z
Art (cosH-tOj (tosny)1 (cosn:)1
N„ (cosnx)n (coswy)2 (cosh;).,
A*3 (cosmjt)3 (cosmji)3 (cosn;)3
where for example the cosine of the direction angle that N2 makes
with the x axis is (cos ma-) 2 and so on. Calling the plane n unity
as before and resolving in each direction successively there re-
sults
[A'j(cos ;i.t-),](cosn.r)1 + [Ar2(cos nx)„] (cos nx)1 +

Example of Principal Stresses.
Suppose the 6 constituents are given as in figure 8. Required
the resultant stress.
There results
l — N O 2
o 3 — A' i
2 i 4 — A'
= (2-A')(3 — N)U — N) +0 + 0—4(3 — N)—o — (2 — JV)
= .V3 — 9 A'2 + 21 A7 — 10 = o.
The value of 1 root is + 2.8 from trial with slide rule. Divid-
ing the cubic by A7 — 2.80 there results N- — 6.2 N + 365 = O
which has for roots + 5.54 and + 0.66.
As a check Xx + Y, + Z, = iV, + Ar2 + Ar3
or 2 + 3 + 4 = 2.80 + 0.66 + 5.54 = 9.00.
If any one principal stress be substituted in the equations of
equilibrium of tetrahedron with the given constituents, these, to-
gether with the relation that the sum of the cosines squared of the
direction angles equals unity for this principal stress, the values
of the angles may be found which determine the plane upon which
it acts. The direction cosines for + 2.8 are cos nx = 0.366, cos ny
= 0.930, cos nz = 0.176; and the angles corresponding 68°-30',
2i°-3o', /9°-5o' respectively. It may be proven that the other
planes are at right angles with little difficulty. As a check,
cos2H.r + cos2My + cos2«^ = unity nearly (1.027).
An ellipsoid of stress solution is relatively more complicated,
and the inverse method of Rankine prohibitive, at least from the
standpoint of the computer.


Momental Ellipsoids and Strain.
The teaching of engineering science largely consists in the
exposition and elaboration of a multitudinous array of inarticu-
lated special devices. Especially is this true of the theory of the
pile and the column, the theory of earth pressure, and retaining
walls. It is incongruous that such a condition of affairs should
exist in a profession which is primarily engaged in the study of
efficiencies. The remedy is to take account of a few generalized
principles, universal and inclusive. As an instance the reader
will readily see the analytical treatment of stresses, is but another
statement of that for forces. He will also see analogies existing
between moments and products of inertia and normal and shear-
ing stresses. The same third order determinant may be used in
obtaining principal moments. While foreign to the scope of this
article a few remarks may be pertinent in the case of strain.
Kirchhoff employed small letters for the strain, viz.:—
■**» y}&gt; 2* are me relative distortions parallel to the coordinate
axes, xy, xlr yt are the shears or angular strains, as used in en-
gineering, very small fractions. Assuming that the body does
not rotate, the determinant cubic for the principal strains is
xx — n xy xz
y* y,—n y*
-»
and the principal strains may be found more directly than by
Rankine's method.
Also the invariant relations may be stated as before:
xx + Jy + "z = «i + w2 + «3 = constant = cubic strain and
two others corresponding with those for stress.
The separate constituents can also be expressed in terms of
the principal strains in the same manner as were the stress con-
stituents using the small letters.
The general problem for the resolution of stresses may be
comprehended under the following theorem. Let Xx, Yy, Zt be
the three normal stresses and Xy, Yz, Zx the three tangential
stresses. Conceive the surface whose equation is
Xx x- + Ky y"- + Zz s* + 2\\ yz + *Zxzx + 2X. xy = 1.


Transform this equation so as to refer the same surface to the
new set of axes. The six coefficients of the transformed equation
will be the six elementary stresses referred to the new axes. A
similar proposition holds for strain (see Rankine's Mechanics, p.
276-277).
In conclusion the writer may remark that although many of
the propositions here given are nearly a hundred years old, the
young engineer will find them efficient and direct in application
to even the simplest of engineering problems. His prejudices
always called into play through an x, y, z statement will usually
vanish in an a, b, c trial for results. He will furthermore find his
interest awakened in that science upon which engineering after it
has passed through its earlier development must ultimately be
founded.


SOME GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS IN THE DESIGN
OF LONG DISTANCE TRANSMISSION LINES.
S. B. WIGGINS, U.S.
The complete calculation and design of a long distance trans-
mission line involves the consideration of a great many questions,
both mathematical and otherwise, each of which must be carefully
investigated and applied to the case in hand.
In any projected installation, the following preliminary infor-
mation will be ascertained:
i. Length of Line.
2. Cost of Power per K.W. Year at the Generating Station.
3. Cost of Conductor per Pound.
4. Interest rate on Line Investment.
An approximation will then be made of:
1. K.W. to be Transmitted.
2. Power Factor of Load.
A frequency will then be decided upon, which will best suit
the load. It will generally be either 25 or 60 cycles per second.
Of the two economical systems, /'. c, high pressure direct cur-
rent, and three phase alternating current, the three phase system
will alone be considered in this paper.
Having the above information, the pressure to be used will
next be taken up. This depends mainly on the length of line and
cost of conductor. High pressure means a small conductor for
the same percentage line loss, while on the other hand it means
a greater cost of line insulation, transformers, switches, etc. Ex-
perience has taught that the following table represents the most
economical practice.
*i Mile 500— 1,000 Volts
1— 2 Miles 1.000— 2,300 Volts
2— 3 Miles 2,300— 6,6oo Volts
3— 10 Miles 6.600— 13,200 Volts
10— 15 Miles 13,200— 22,000 Volts
15— 20 Miles 22.000— 44,000 Volts
♦Tables used by one of the large electrical manufacturers.


20— 40 Miles 44,000— 66,000 Volts
40— 60 Miles 66,000— 88,000 Volts
60—100 Miles 88,000—110,000 Volts
At the present time there are lines being built for voltages as
high as 138,000 volts, and as the problems of insulation are solved,
the voltage will probably be carried still higher.
Having determined the voltage to be used, the spacing of the
conductors is established from the following table.
*V0LTS INTERAXIAL DISTANCE
5,000 28 inches
15.000 ..._ 40 inches
30,000 48 inches
45,000 60 inches
75,000 1 84 inches
00,000 96 inches
105,000 108 inches
120,000 120 inches
In all cases before deciding on the spacing of conductors,
corona effects must be considered. The designer must also assure
himself that the conductors are spaced far enough apart, so that
they will not sway too close together during wind storms.
Having decided on the voltage and line spacing, we may now
proceed with the investigation of the following.
1. Most economic Line Loss.
2. Cross Sectional Area of Conductor.
3. Resistance of Line, including the increase of resistance
due to skin effect.
4. Natural Period of Line.
5. Kilowatts lost in line, and K.V.A. delivered at generating
end of Line.
6. Power Factor of line, which requires the investigation of
the inductance and capacity of the line.
7. Charging Current.
8. Regulation of Line.
Each of the above points is a problem in itself, and the writer
will not attempt to discuss them here, but will proceed with some
other considerations which must be taken into account in the com-
* Tables used by one of the large electrical manufacturers.


plete design. The illustrations shown are taken from the 300
mile, 110,000 volt line of the Ontario Hydro Electric Power Com-
mission.
Line Structure.
Of the four available line supports, i. c, wooden poles, steel
poles, steel towers and reinforced concrete poles, the last can be
eliminated, except in some very special cases, on account of the
prohibitive cost. Of the other three, wooden poles will predom-
inate on lines of 40,000 volts or less, except the line is of extreme
importance, and transmits a very large amount of power. Of
late however, with the advancing price of timber, steel poles are
entering the field, and bid fair to replace wood to some extent.
This is especially true in parts of the country where climatic con-
ditions are such that wooden poles depreciate rapidly.
When a transmission pressure of 40,000 volts is passed, we are
getting into the field of large power, long distance lines, which
require heavy construction, and poles begin to be out of the ques-
tion. The rapid increase in the cost of insulators when the 40,000
volt mark is passed, demands that the insulators used be as few
in number as possible. This means long spans, and consequently
high towers, to allow for the necessary sag of the conductors.
High pressure also means greater spacing between conductors,
and the length of wooden cross arms is limited. Greater reliabil-
ity and longer life must also be credited to steel towers.
Of the different types of towers, there are two distinct classes,
rigid and flexible. Rigid towers are illustrated in Fig. 1. They
are so designed, that in case some or possibly all of the conductors
break, each tower will withstand the abnormal stresses imposed
thereby, in the direction of the line. Flexible towers are designed
primarily as columns to support the conductors, and in case of
breakage, the towers will bend, until the stress is distributed over
several towers. There is danger however that one or more towers
will collapse entirely, pulling down the whole line, and thus inter-
rupting service for a considerable time. Flexible towers are of
course cheaper than those of the rigid type. Their use is largely
a matter of opinion, it being an open question, as to whether or
not the reduced cost overbalances the lessened reliability. A com-
promise may be effected, as was done in the 70-mile line of the


23
o


City of Winnipeg, in which case alternate rigid and flexible tow-
ers were used.
Insulators.
The dividing line between pin type and suspension type insu-
lators is quite sharply drawn. Pin insulators are used for 60,000
volts or less and suspension insulators for presures in excess of
this. The limiting features of the pin insulator are its great size
when built for high voltages, and consequent high cost, and the
problem of supporting the insulator satisfactorily.
Suspension insulators permit the use of any dielectric strength
desired by merely adding more units. On the other hand they re-
quire higher towers to secure the necessary clearance, and also
the use of strain insulators wherever the line makes an angle, as
shown in Fig. 2. The insulators shown in Fig. 1, on a 110,000
volt line are about 4^ feet long.
Conductor Material.
Of the two available conductor materials, copper and alum-
inium, it would be natural to expect that the choice between them
would be made solely on the basis of cost. At present, aluminium
costs about 10% less for equal conductivity. There are however
certain other elements that enter into the problem somewhat.
1. The unit tensile strength and coefficient of expansion be-
ing greater for aluminium than for copper, greater sag must be
allowed when using aluminium. This requires that higher tow-
ers be used, and consequently greater expense.
2. Aluminium has no intrinsic value. Its price is fixed arbi-
trarily, and consequently the time may come when the scrap value
of aluminium may drop considerably.
3. On account of the softness of aluminium, greater care
must be used in stringing. On the other hand, for equal conduc-
tivity, aluminium weighs about one half as much as copper, and
is therefore much easier to handle.
4. Sleet will not stick to aluminium as readily as to copper.
Lightning Protection.
Taken in its broadest meaning, lightning, in connection with a
transmission line, is the presence of any abnormal pressure or
frequency. It may be caused by atmospheric lightning or by con-


25

ditions on the line itself, such as the switching of a large amount
of power, an arcing ground, or a short circuit. Great variety of
opinion exists among operating engineers as to what extent of
protection is necessary against the damaging effects of lightning.
For instance, the 110,000 volt lines of the Comonwealth Power
Co. of Michigan, have no protection whatever, while the line
shown in Fig. 1, operating at the same voltage, is provided with
four ground wires, and arresters at every station.
Atmospheric lightning causes disturbances in three ways.
1. Direct Stroke.
2. Electromagnetic Induction.
3. Electrostatic Induction.
Fortunately the first occurs but seldom, and for protection
against it a ground wire, strung above the conductors, must be
relied upon, and even this does not protect absolutely. The ma-
jority of authorities on this subject are agreed that it pays to in-
stall at least one ground wire, but the advantage of more than
one is not plainly evident. Others claim that the protection af-
forded by any ground wire is not worth the expense of installing
and maintaining it. Insulators are further protected by a ground-
ed wire ring, which in case the line is struck directly, will gener-
ally take off the discharge without breaking the insulator.
Disturbances due to electromagnetic induction are theoretical
to a large extent, and need not be considered in practice.
Disturbances by electrostatic induction are the most important,
and are brought about in the following manner: Consider a
storm cloud approaching a line charged with a positive potential.
The earth below- the cloud, including the line, will be cliarged with
an opposite potential. The potential, between the earth and cloud
is finally equalized by a discharge of lightning to earth. This dis-
charge sets free the bound charge on the line and it passes to
earth by the easiest path possible. It might break over the insu-
lators, but more probably, if the line has a grounded neutral, it
will travel over the line to the station, and pass to ground through
the transformers, in which case the insulation of the transformer
coils will probably be punctured. It is here that the lightning
arrester is of value. As the abnormal voltage reaches the station,
it passes to ground over the lightning arrester, this being an easier


27
path than through the transformers. This is expedited by the in-
troduction of choke coils between the lightning arresters and
transformers. Choke coils, by their inductive reactance, hold back
the sudden rush of current and give the arresters time to act.
The usefulness of the lightning arrester is well established.
Space will not permit a detailed discussion of the theory and ac-
tion of arresters, however, the general characteristics and uses of
the three common types will be noted.
(a) Horn gap arresters consist of two conductors, one con-
nected to the line, the other to the ground, bent in the shape of
horns, and separated by an air gap. When the voltage reaches
an excessive value, the current arcs across the air gap, and con-
tinues to flow, until the arc rises, continually lengthening, until it
finally breaks. Once the arc is established it forms a short cir-
cuit for the dynamic current of the system, which continues as
long as the arc exists. This is usually long enough to throw syn-
chronous apparatus out of step, and consequently a shutdown re-
sults. For this reason, horn gap arresters are not used on lines
requiring great continuity of service.
(b) Multiple gap arresters consist of a number of short air
gaps in series, between cylinders of "non-arcing metal." Non-
arcing metal permits the easy passage of an arc in one direction
only. Furthermore all but a few of the air gaps are shunted with
graded resistances, and as a result of this combination the short
circuit lasts only until the generator voltage curve passes through
the zero point, a maximum of one-half cycle.
(c) Aluminium cell arresters consist of a series of aluminium
cones, immersed in an alkaline electrolyte. A unit thus assembled,
has a back electromotive force depending on the number of cells
in series (about 300 volts per cell), and can be connected directly
between the line and ground. When operating at the voltage for
which it is designed, the current is very small, but rises rapidly
as the voltage increases above normal. The arrester thus acts as a
safety valve for the system. It can be connected permanently to
the system, or only when it is needed, which is accomplished by
placing it in series with a horn gap arrester, set with a small air
gap.
Lightning phenomena arising within the circuit, are caused
mainly by the switching of a large amount of power, an arcing


ground, a short circuit, etc. The first and last set up surges of
current, and an arcing ground causes surges of an extremely high
frequency on the system. Surges are liable to cause a dangerous
rise of pressure at the terminals. Lightning arresters are the pro-
tection against such cases. In cases where even a small rise of
voltage might be dangerous, such as in an underground cable
system, it may be necessary to ground the lines through an espec-
ially designed aluminium arrester, which is connected to the line
continuously.
Transformer Connections.
Probably on no other point in the layout of a transmission line,
does there exist more difference of opinion, than on the question
of the best connection for the transformers. The best arrange-
ment depends largely on local conditions and a brief statement of
the characteristics of the different systems might indicate which
system is the most desirable for the case in hand.
The present discussion will be confined mostly to the high
tension side of the system, and the question resolves itself into
deciding between a delta or a star connection. Most of the ad-
vantages of the star connection disappear unless the neutral is
grounded, and the discussion is therefore further restricted to the
delta ungrounded system or the star with a grounded neutral.
1. As to transformers: With the star connection each trans-
former of the bank must be wound for only i/V3 = 58% of full
line voltage, and full line current, whereas with the delta connec-
tion each transformer must be wound for full line voltage but
only 58% full line current. A transformer for delta connection
therefore, would require 73% more turns, insulated for full line
voltage. This makes a larger and more expensive coil, which re-
quires a longer magnetic circuit and therefore a larger and heavier
transformer throughout. This is not important when the voltage
is low or when the transformer is large and the current is high,
but the difference in cost is very material, as the voltage increases.
2. With the star connection and a grounded neutral, an acci-
dental ground on one of the lines, means a short circuit on that
part of the system, and consequently a shut down. With the
transformers in delta however, the system can continue operating
on open delta, at 2/3 load. An accidental ground with the trans-


29
formers star connected, does not necessarily mean a permanent
shutdown. The grounded line can be cut out, and the service re-
sumed, using the two good lines and the ground for conductors.
This is not permissible however, if the line is in close proximity
with parallel telephone and telegraph lines, for the following rea-
son. The ground is one of the conductors of the system, and the
current through ground will take the easiest path possible. If
there are telephone lines adjacent, which are insulated from
ground for a small voltage only, a portion of the ground current
will flow over the telephone line, and service will be entirely cut
off. This is apt to lead to innumerable legal complications, and
hence the use of the ground as a conductor should not be counted
upon, unless adjacent telephone lines are unusually well insulated
from ground.
The fact that an accidental ground with a star connection is a
short circuit, has one advantage. It indicates immediately, by
throwing out the circuit breakers, that such a ground exists, and
this line can then be cut out, thus lessening the danger to life and
property which such ground would intensify, on the premises
where the power is utilized.
3. Having a grounded neutral has the advantage that the sys-
tem can be balanced statically. With the ungrounded delta con-
nection, the neutral is unstable, and may shift, depending on out-
side conditions. The potential between line and ground could
therefore increase to much more than normal, and might increase
to such an extent that the insulation between line and ground
would give way. This state of affairs is impossible with a ground-
ed neutral, as the neutral of the system is always at zero poten-
tial. With the star connection therefore, lightning arresters can
be set to discharge at a potential less than line voltage, and will
protect more effectually than with the delta connection, where a
certain variation must be allowed for, on account of the shifting
of the neutral.
4. Resonance is possible with star connection, but impossible
with delta. Resonance exists when a reactance and a capacity in
series, are of such values, that the total impedance of the line is
the ohmic resistance. The only reactance in a transmission line
large enough to cause resonance, is the open circuit reactance of
one of the high tension transformer coils. If the low tension side


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
of one of the transformers in star connection was opened, the re-
actance of the high tension coil of this transformer would be in
series with the line capacity. This circuit would be energized by
the other leg of the star connection, with the result that a current
would flow, limited only by the ohmic resistance of the line. This
enormous current would cause an excessive pressure across the
reactance of the dead transformer coil, which would probably be
sufficient to break down the transformer insulation.
Such a condition, as was stated before, is impossible with a
delta connection. The possibility of its happening with star con-
nection may be lessened by having all transformer switches triple
pole, so that all coils are disconnected at the same time, or else
by disconnecting the high tension side of the transformer before
the low tension side is cut out.
5. There exists in the voltage curve of generators, a third
harmonic, i. e., a pressure with a frequency of three times that of
the fundamental. The fundamental pressures are 1200 apart,
hence the third harmonics are 3 X 120=360° apart, in other
words, in phase with each other. The third harmonics of a star
connected generator, therefore, reach a maximum in all three legs
at the same time, and if a path is provided between these lines
and the neutral of the generator, a current of triple frequency will
flow. It is seen that as far as the third harmonic is concerned,
the generator is a single phase machine.
The importance of this fact in transformer connections is as
follows: If the neutral of the generator is grounded, and also the
neutral of the high tension line, there is a path for this triple fre-
quency current, over the line, through the transformers to ground,
and thence back to the grounded generator neutral. This is a
path of very low resistance, and the triple frequency current will
be large. It will induce a correspondingly large current in the
secondary of the transformer, and if the transformer is small com-
pared with the generator, which is apt to be the case, the triple
frequency secondary current might be sufficient to burn out the
transformer.
If a grounded neutral has been decided upon, the question
arises, how shall the ground be made. There are two ways, a
direct connection, or a connection through resistance, and both
methods have their advocates. The best practice appears to be


that there shall be enough resistance so that an accidental ground
will not cause too great a shock to the system, as a result of the
short circuit current, while at the same time, it must not be large
enough to hinder the immediate operation of the circuit breakers.
The above is not given as the complete discussion of a trans-
mission line or even a complete discussion of the topics consid-
ered, but it is hoped that it will point out some of the essentials
that must be considered, in order to predetermine the characteris-
tics of a line.


ELECTRIFICATION OF THE DETROIT RIVER TUNNEL
W. M. RENNIE.
One of the great engineering feats of this century, the build-
ing of the twin tube tunnel under the Detroit River has now been
completed and in operation for several months. Approximately
$10,000,000 has been expended to give the Michigan Central an
all-rail route between New York and Chicago, and to eliminate
the ferries which were used to transfer trains from Detroit to
Windsor, Ontario.
The general location is as follows: Beginning at the inter-
section of 15th and Baker Streets in Detroit the tunnel runs along
the right of way to the river; diagonally across the river and en-
ters beneath the M. C. R. R. tracks a few feet to the east of the
old Windsor depot at the corner of Cameron and Sandwich Streets
in Windsor. From that point it follows the right of way through-
out.
The tunnel is 12,783 feet long, consisting of five divisions:
the Westerly Open Cut, 1,510 feet; Westerly Approach Tunnel,
2,158 feet; the Subaqueous Tunnel, 2,665 feet; the Easterly Ap-
proach Tunnel, 3,550 feet; and the Easterly Open Cut, 2,900 feet.
The maximum grades are West bound into Detroit 2% and East
bound into Canada 1^/2%. Near the foot of either grade is a
2°-o' curve.
The Subaqueous tunnel which is practically level, consists of
parallel circular steel tubes 23 feet in diameter, built up of y% inch
steel plate. They are placed 26 feet apart center to center and
connected by diaphrams at 12 foot intervals.- The tubes were
built in sections, ten of which were approximately 260 feet long
and an eleventh a little over 60 feet long. These sections were
constructed in a ship yard, towed into position, sunk into a trench
prepared for them in the bottom of the river and then concreted
on the outside.
Before placing the interior concrete, the tube sections, since
the tunnel is operated with direct current, were bonded together,
to prevent electrolysis, with twenty-four 500,000 CM. bonds;


twelve in each tube. The Detroit end of the tubes is connected
with a 2,000,000 CM. cable to the negative or track rail feeders.
In 1906 a short time after construction work started the ques-
tion of train operation through the tunnel was considered by the
engineers in charge. Operation with steam locomotives was not
thought feasible and naturally the electrification of the tunnel
and necessary yards for handling trains in and out of the tunnel
was the conclusion.
The three systems at present in use, namely: single phase,
three phase and direct current were presented, but the latter, pre-
sumeably on account of its reliability and the short distance the
trains are operated as well as other entering factors, was selected.
The Company moreover decided not to build its own generating
station but to purchase its power as alternating current from the
Detroit Edison Company.
The substation, a very neat building of concrete and steel
faced with red pressed brick, stands on the bank of the Detroit
river; the front of the building being about IOO feet from the
center line of the tunnel. The location is ideal as it is very nearly
the center of distribution.
Energy is received at the substation from the mains of the
Detroit Edison Co. at 4,400 volts, 3 phase, 60 cycles and 650 volt
direct current is delivered to the locomotives. The energy is pur-
chased on a maximum demand and K.W.-Hour basis, so to pre-
vent excessive peaks on the incoming lines a storage battery has
been installed to take care of load fluctuations.
For converting the 4,400 volt alternating current into direct
current two 1,000 K.W. motor generator sets have been installed.
They are horizontal, two bearing units, mounted on a common
base and run at 514 R.P.M. Each set consists of a General Elec-
tric 1060 K.W. 3 phase, 14 pole synchronous motor direct con-
nected to a 1,000 K.W. 8 pole, 650 volt direct current generator.
On an extension of the shaft at the motor end is a 15 K.W. 125
volt exciter. The switchboard wiring is so arranged that the
motor-generators may be started and put into service from either
the A.C. or D.C. busses. An auto starter is installed for starting
with the synchronous motor and the sets come up to speed in less
than a minute on the 35% tap.


THE MICHIGAN TECHN1C
The generators are shunt wound, are provided with interpoles
and operate in parallel with the storage battery. Besides the
shunt field windings there are auxiliary field windings separately
excited from the storage battery booster. These windings are an
important part of a scheme for load regulation in that they can
increase the armature flux until the voltage is 700 or decrease
the flux until the voltage is reduced to 575 so the machines can
be used for either charging or discharging the battery. Fig. 1
is a general view of the substation showing the motor generator
sets.
The storage battery consists of 312 Gould cells, 43 plates in
59 plate tanks. The plates are i8y? inches square. The battery
has an eight hour discharge rate of 630 amps, or 2,520 amps, for
one hour and is capable of withstanding momentary discharges
of three times the normal one hour rate. For automatically con-
trolling the charge and discharge of the battery a motor driven
booster and necessary regulating devices are installed.
The booster generator voltage is sufficient when operating in
series with the battery and the battery is working as a regulating
battery on the main bus and discharging 2,520 amperes for one
hour or momentarily 7,560 amperes, that the voltage on the bus
bars does not drop below 575 volts.
The principal regulating apparatus for battery and load con-
trol are an exciter set for the booster, a small rectifier set for ob-
taining current for regulating purposes and a load limit device.
Without going into the details of this regulating apparatus, the
results of their operations only will be given. At periods of zero
load on the station the motor generator sets are charging the bat-
tery. This charging current may for example average 700 am-
peres. If the station now be subjected to a load, the motor gen-
erator sets will attempt to assume their share of the load. In the
incoming lines from the Edison Co. to the motor generator sets,
series of transformers are connected and current from these trans-
formers is conducted to the small rectifier set mentioned. Thus
an increase of load on the motor generators increases the current
supplied to the rectifier set. This increased rectified current
which varies as the amperes times the power factor of the circuit
eventually increases the booster exciter voltage and the battery
is compelled to assume the load less the 700 amperes constantly

supplied by the generators. This regulating apparatus may be
adjusted to maintain the load on the motor generator sets within
7V2% or up to 33 i/Z°/° on either side of an average while caus-
ing the battery to charge at any rate up to the hour rate or dis-
charge at any rates up to three times the one hour rate. If this
load be exceeded then the load limit device is actuated and sup-
plies increasing current to the auxiliary fields on the generators
of the motor generator sets causing them to assume this excess
load up to 100% overload. If the load for any reason should
further increase, the battery and generators are cut off by the
opening of the protecting circuit breakers. The apparatus is cap-
able of adjustment so that the average load falling on the motor
generator sets may be varied from time to time.
The Substation also contains a 50 K.W. motor generator set
arranged to be run off the storage battery and supply 4,400 volt
alternating current for tunnel lighting and pumping and track
signal transformers, in case of total shutdown on the Edison Co's.
lines. Three 7.5 ampere 50 lamp constant current arc transform-
ers located behind the switch board are used for lighting the
yards on both sides of the river.
The switch board is divided into two sections, one for railway
control, the other devoted to tunnel lighting and pumping and
miscellaneous uses. The tunnel pump board is in duplicate. All
bus bars, current and potential transformers are located in com-
partments in the basement. The regular alternating current ser-
vice switches for railway control are remote controlled and pro-
vided with overload release. The lighting and pump switches are
hand operated and provided with overload release.
In front of the substation a ventilating shaft connects the sur-
face of the ground and the tunnel below. This shaft carries the
cables from the substation to the tunnel ducts below. The tunnel
duct runs are built up along both sides of the two tubes into
bench walls, with manholes every 400 feet. These bench walls are
continuous from portal to portal and serve as foot paths. The
yard duct systems join the tunnel ducts at the portals and no con-
ductors of any kind are located on poles above ground.
The tunnel is lighted with 800 sixteen candle power carbon
filament lamps. There are two rows in each tube and the lamps
are 40 feet apart. Each lamp is furnished with a reflector. Cur-


37
rent for tunnel lighting is supplied from 7.5 K.W. 4400 to 104
volt single phase subway transformers located in niches in the
walls. Each transformer is connected to a lighting cabinet of
eight circuits.
To collect seepage water and rain fall five sumps ranging in
capacity from 32,000 to 67,000 gallons have been built at different
points beneath the tunnel. Each sump contains two duplicate
motor operated vertical shaft centrifugal pumps controlled from
the substation. High and low water alarms notify the operators
in the substation the condition of the water in each sump.
The method of distribution is of passing interest. Current is
supplied to the locomotives by an under running third rail of the
Wilgus or better known as the bull head type. The rail weighs
70 pounds per yard and is supported with malleable iron brackets
and two-piece porcelain insulators, a hook bolt being used to hold
the insulators and rail to the bracket. The rail joints are bonded
with two 500,000 CM. soldered bonds. All track rails in the
electrified district are of 100 pound steel and the joints are bonded
with either two 400,000 or 500,000 CM. bonds. The larger bonds
being used only through the tunnel and on the grades.
The third rail feeders and track returns are of 1,000,000 and
2,000,000 CM. cross section.
Reduced to a single track basis the total electrified track is
20 miles.
In the Detroit and Windsor yards at the summit of the grades,
signal towers have been built. Each tower contains seven railway
panels for yard distribution and are fed direct from the substation
by two T.000.000 CM. cables.
In this installation as in other electrified railways, interest cen-
ters largely in the locomotives.
With the exception of the Pennsylvania locomotives those in
use through the Detroit river tunnel are the most powerful direct
current units yet constructed. The conditions under which they
operate have been given as follows:
Two locomotives coupled together must be capable of hauling
an 1,800-ton train up the 2% grade of the approach tunnel at a
speed not less than ten miles per hour and they must be able to
start this load on the grade. The General Electric Co. and the


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC

39
American Locomotive Co., the builders of the locomotives, have
more than met the specifications.
Mechanically the locomotives depart widely from the other
types now in use. The wheel arrangement may be classed as the
0-4-4-0, that is, there are no pilot wheels and the drivers are ar-
ranged in two symmetrical four-wheeled trucks. These two
trucks coupled together with a massive hinge comprise a single
articulated running gear, having great lateral flexibility and ver-
tical rigidity, but so designed that one truck resists the tilting
tendencies of the other.
The locomotives weigh 199,000 pounds, additional weight hav-
ing been added in the construction in order to permit a full utili-
zation of the tractive power which the motors are capable of de-
veloping. A general view of locomotive No. 7505 is shown in
Figure 2.
Each locomotive is gear driven by four motors, the combined
normal rating being 1200 H.P. The driving wheels are 48 inches
in diameter and the gear ratio 4.37. The instantaneous tractive
effort is approximately 60,000 pounds and at a speed of 11 miles
per hour and a tractive effort of 50,000 pounds, the locomotive
develops 1450 H.P. The maximum speed running light is 35
miles per hour.
On account of the long heavy trains the locomotives are re-
quired to handle the control system is divided into a great num-
ber of steps so that the increments of speed are imperceptible and
at no time from point to point on the controller is the slipping
point of the wheels exceeded.
The locomotives arc equipped for operation in multiple unit
but on account of the train weights one locomotive is placed
ahead and another at the rear of all freight trains. Passenger
trains are handled with one locomotive only.
In the time that the tunnel has been in service substation and
locomotive troubles have been negligible.


STRENGTH OF MATERIALS UNDER COMPOUND
STRESS.
A. E. GREENE.
When the strength of a material is mentioned, one naturally
thinks of the greatest axial load a bar or prism of that material
will carry in tension or compression. The determination of
strength under axial load is quite simple and vast numbers of
such tests have been made , but in many structures the material
is not pulled or comprest in one direction only but may be strest
in two or three directions at the same time, and the question arises
as to what determines the failure of material so circumstanced.
Experiments on bodies in a condition of compound stress are not
so easily made as those before mentioned but enough has been
done to throw considerable light on the action of ductil materials
under compound stress. The subject is one of great importance
in machine design because the resulting size of a piece so strest
depends upon what theory of strength the designer adopts.
Before discussing the various theories of failure the writer
will summarize a few of the principles about stresses and strains
which can be found in treatises on Strength of Materials. The
stress at any given point of any imaginary plane through a body
is to be understood to mean the intensity of the force with which
the material on one side of the section acts against the material
on the other side of the section at the given point. The strain is
the deformation of the material which accompanies the stress.
At every point in a stressed body there are three mutually per-
pendicular planes on which the stress is normal. The stresses on
these planes are the principal stresses and their directions are the
axes of stress. One of these principal stresses is the greatest
stress existing on any plane through the point and another is the
least. When two of these principal stresses are zero the body is
said to be in a condition of simple stress—the case of a bar under
axial load. When one of the principal stresses is zero the condi-
tion of stress is said to be two dimensional—for example, the case


41
of a plate pulled in two directions. The principal stresses are de-
noted by pu pu p3.
Three axes of strain coincide with the axes of stress and the
principal strains, which occur along the axes, are purely longi-
tudinal. The principal strains are denoted by clt c^ er
Experiment shows that the principal stresses and strains of a
bar in a condition of simple stress are
t&gt;i Pi = O pi = O
ei = pi:E ea =— pi:mE e2 = — pi.mE (1)
in which It is Young's modulus of elasticity and m is the recipro-
cal of Poisson's ratio.
Compounding three simple stresses at right angles shows that,
in general, the strains in terms of the principal stresses are
A _ Pt + h e. = £l_Pl+fa «, = ■£&gt;- fr+fo (2)
E mE /■; mE E mE K'
Solving these equations for pi, p„, and p3 gives the stresses in
terms of the strains:
(m-\-i)(m—2) l m -\- 1
and two similar equations which can be written by changing the
subscripts of pl and of e1 in the last term. These equations show
that in general the stress is not proportional to the strain. Hooke's
law is true only between p1 and (\ when p2 and p3 are each zero.
However it is frequently convenient to express a linear strain in
terms of stress, as it were; that is, to multiply the strain by B to
obtain the equivalent simple stress. Some writers call this the
"true stress," a most unfortunate appellation and one likely to
cause serious error in reasoning.
For most engineering problems a discussion of two dimen-
sional stress is sufficient and henceforth the discussion will be con-
fined to that condition. If two principal stresses pl and p2 are
known, the normal and shearing components of the stress on a
plane making an angle 0 with the axis of p2 can be found by cut-
ting out an indefinitely small prism around the point, ABC, Fig. 1,
and making the components of the forces on the faces equal to
zero along each axis:

deformed into an ellipse which in the figure is greatly exaggerated.
The strain AC of any line OA is made up of a longitudinal strain
AB = e1 cos2 0 -\- e2 sin2 6 and a slide BC = (cy — e„) sin 6 cos 6.
If the stresses on two planes at right angles, as AD and BD
of Fig. 5, are known, the principal stresses can be found by mak-
ing 0 such an angle that the forces along the x and the y axes
equal zero. The solution of the equations, which give two values
of 0 differing by 90 3 and two values of the principal stress, one
on each plane, is

Of the theories propounded as to how materials fail, the three
which have been recognized by engineers are
The maximum stress theory,
The maximum strain theory, and
The maximum shear theory.
According to the first a material fails when the greatest prin-
cipal stress exceeds a certain limiting value regardless of the mag-
nitude of the other two principal stresses. This theory, which is
the simplest and which would most naturally suggest itself to the
designer has generally been followed by English and American
engineers.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
According to the second the material is capable of enduring a
certain amount of deformation and will fail when the linear strain
exceeds that amount. This theory is in general use among French
and German writers and has been taken up to some extent in this
country.
The third theory holds that failure takes place when the max-
imum shear in the body exceeds a certain limiting value. This
theory has been much discussed among English engineers during
the last few years but has not been used to any considerable
extent.
Which, if any, of these theories is true must be determined by
experiment. Mr. James J. Guest published in the Philosophical
Magazine of 1900 the results of many tests he made to solve the
problem. Some of his experiments were made on steel tubes ar-
ranged in a testing machine in such a way that they could be sub-
jected at the same time to a longitudinal pull, to a torsional mo-
ment and to internal fluid pressure. By combining the loadings
in various ways,' different stress conditions could be produced in
the shell. In making the tests a known torque and a known axial
pull were applied and then a gradually increasing fluid pressure
was added until the yield point of the material, which was assum-
ed to mark the breaking down or failure of the material, was
reached. From the known forces the normal stress on a right
section caused by the axial tension, the normal stress on a longi-
tudinal section caused by the fluid pressure, and the shear on both
sections caused by the torque can be found and from them the
principal stresses and strains and the maximum shear can be com-
puted by the preceding equations.
The following table gives the principal stresses, the maximum
principal strain multiplied by the modulus of elasticity, and the
maximum shear at the yield point as obtained from some of
Guest's experiments on steel tubes of 1J-4 in. diameter and O.025
in. thick. Compression is marked —.

It is seen that the metal did not break down when the maxi-
mum stress reached some definite value nor when the maximum
strain became some definite amount but failure did occur in every
case when the shear became 21 000 or 22 000 lb. per sq. in., a fact
bearing out the truth of the third theory so far as soft steel is
concerned. Many other experiments have been made in England
along this line as may be seen by consulting the pages of London
"Engineering" of 1910. Similar tests on brass and aluminium
do not show such uniform shearing strength as those on steel but
the general result of compound stress tests is to show that ductil
materials fail by shearing.
To design a piece made of a ductil metal the greatest shearing
stress to which it is liable must be known. The maximum shear
on any plane through the dangerous point depends only on the
greatest and the least of the principal stresses there, that is, if
Pi &gt; p3&gt; Pi, &lt;7max occurs on a plane through the axis of p3 and
the critical condition is that of equation (8). In such materials
the yield point is about the same in tension as in compression and,
as the maximum shear in a bar under axial load is one-half the
stress on the right section, the safe working stress in shear should
be one-half that in tension or in compression. This remark ap-
plies to such structures as shafts and cylinders but not to rivets
in which the shearing condition is quite different.
If p3 = o, the limiting safe stresses according to the maximum
shear theory can be shown by the diagram of Fig. 6. The co-
ordinates of any point represent the two principal stresses, those
inside the hexagon showing allowed stress conditions. Points in
the second and fourth quadrants give principal stresses of opposite
kind accompanying which there is a maximum shear ]A. (/&gt;, — p„).
If the material is subjected to a tension BA in one direction, the
compression at right angles must not exceed CA if the stress is
to be kept within safe limits. Points in the first and third quad-
rants give stresses of the same kind and, as the shearing planes
in a body under that stress condition do not contain the axis of
p3 but pass through cither the axis of pt or of p2 with a maximum
shear of ]A /&gt;„ or y2 pv the composition of a second stress of the
same kind at right angles to the first does not affect the strength
of the body.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
The maximum shear theory, which experiment proves true of
ductil metals, is but a special case of a general theory based on
the circle of stress which has been propounded by Professor Otto

Mohr. See his Technische Mechanik, or Vol. V. of Foeppl's work
of the same title. This theory, which agrees fairly well with such
facts as are known concerning failure, is:
First, the liability of a material to rupture depends only on the
greatest and the least of the three principal stresses existing at
the dangerous point; that is, if pt &gt; p3 &gt; /&gt;„ the magnitude of /&gt;,
does not affect the liability to failure. (Whether such is the fact
for all materials is not known, but it has been proved to be true
of sandstone and of concrete blocks, loaded top and bottom in a
testing machine and restrained laterally on two sides.) The prob-


lem is thus reduced to a study of conditions of two dimensional
stress.
Secondly, for any given material the circles of stress, repre-
senting the various stress conditions which will cause failure, are
bounded by some such curve as that of Fig. 7. The exact nature
of the curve must be determined from experiments which unfor-
tunately are largely lacking at present, but two of the enclosed
circles are known for all materials; that for failure in simple ten-
sion and that for failure in simple compression. These are the
circles shown in the figure. In default of information by which
to form the curve, tangents drawn to the two known circles will
be used in its sted, Fig. 8.
The elastic limit or yield point is supposed to determine fail-
ure if a material have such; otherwise rupture. For ductil ma-
terials, the yield points in tension and compression being about
the same, the two given stress circles have the same diameter and
the limiting tangents are parallel. Then all circles between the
tangents have the same diameter so that pl — /&gt;, = a constant, a
condition fulfilled for this particular case by the maximum shear
theory.
To apply the theory to the design of a piece under compound
stress when the working stresses for tension and compression
(fi and /,,). are different, it is necessary to determine the stress
circle having the right relationship between f1 and p„ to suit the
particular problem. The center of the desired circle is p =
% (Pi + ^2). 9=o an(l its radius is yi (pt— p2). The equation
of the upper tangent is (/c — ft) p + 2y/(feft) q — fvft=o, and
from analytical geometry the perpendicular distance from the cen-
ter of the circle to the tangent, which distance is equal to the
radius of the circle, is
W—MHfr + h) -/•/«]:(* + /•)=-*(*-*).
The equation reduces to
fc—ft /«/.
i(.P* + P') hHf,-W= (11)
/« + /« /• + /«
which is the condition to be satisfied.
The application of the preceding theories to two problems will
conclude this article.


If a crank shaft is acted on at the dangerous section by a bend-
ing moment M and a torque T, at some point on the section there
is a normal stress, p = 10.2 M :d3 and a shear (7 = 5.1 T:cP. Then

If the material is to be subjected to its limiting stress condi-
tion at the dangerous section, px or B cx is to be replaced by f, the
safe working stress, and q by the safe shearing stress or J4 f. The
required size according to the various theories is

The last demands the largest shaft.
By Mohr's theory when the material of the shaft has different
working stresses in tension and compression, since
y2 (/&gt;, + /&gt;,) =y2p = 5.iM :d' and
*A (/&gt;. -/&gt;.) = V]iTT7 = 5-1 V~aF+T :d\
from (11) the critical condition is

When a thick cylinder of inner and outer radii of r and R is
under an internal pressure f&gt;, at the inner surface the principal
stresses are

As before the maximum shear theory demands the largest section.
When the working stresses in tension and compression are
different
% (Pi -r Pi) = ■=■?* -. P , X (Pi - Pi) = -j^—.P
and Mohr's theory gives
El = /t~l'-/i./cM
&gt;-- /t-(i4-/t-/c)/&gt;
It is interesting to note that Mohr's theory and the maximum
strain theory lead to the same equation both for the shaft and the
thick cylinder when fc: ft = m. For cast iron m lies between
3 and 4 and the compressive strength is 3 or 4 times the tensil
strength, hence, if Mohr's theory is correct, cast iron shafts and
cylinders may be designed according to the maximum strain the-
ory, whereas the same pieces, if made of steel should be designed
bv the maximum shear theorv.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
FLOW OF STEAM THROUGH NOZZLES.
DISCUSSION OF THE PRESSURE IN THE THROAT OF A NOZZLE WHEN
THE BACK PRESSURE IS LESS THAN 58% OF THE INITIAL
PRESSURE.
J. E. EMSWILER.
It is a well-known fact, determined by thermodynamics and ex-
periment, that, when the back pressure against which a nozzle is
discharging steam, is less than 58% of the initial pressure, the
pressure in the throat of the nozzle is constant and independent of
the back pressure, and is equal to about 58% of the initial pressure.
The reason for this peculiar relation is not at once apparent; and
it requires a study of the law of steam flow to gain a physical con-
ception of it.
The weight of steam flowing past any section of a nozzle, or
for that matter, of any pasage, depends upon three things, viz.,
velocity, specific volume, and area at the section under considera-
tion. The equation of continuity of flow expresses their relation.
W = "l!l = a^'z = ggjj = etc.
Sy S% S3
where IV— weight of steam flowing per second.
au a„, a.-, etc. = areas at different sections (in square feet).
Vx, V2, V3, etc. = velocities at alt a2, az, etc. (feet per second.)
sls s2, s„, etc. = specific volumes at a^, a^, a3, etc. (cubic feet.)
Consider the nozzle of Fig. 1. At the nozzle entrance (1) the
pressure is p±. The velocity V, is low and is the velocity of ap-
proach. The specific volume is nearly that of the steam in the
nozzle bowl. At (2) the pressure has dropped to p.,, giving, in
expansion, an available energy which produces a velocity V3. The
specific volume has increased to s.,. Similarly at (3) the pressure
has further dropped to /&gt;.,, giving an available energy which pro-
duces the velocity V3 and the specific volume has increased to s%.
And so on for other points along the nozzle.


51
Referring to the equation for continuity of flow, it is seen
tliat in the coefficient of au (V/s), Lx)th V and j increase as the
steam passes further along the nozzle. But on account of the
manner in which they depend upon the pressure, at the respective
points, they do not increase at the same rate. Therefore V/s is a
variable quantity, and a varies inversely z.S'V/s.
f,j. /
It will be found that during the first part of the expansion, V
increases more rapidly than s, while during the latter part of the
expansion, j increases more rapidly than V. Hence a will have a
minimum value at some point along the nozzle where V/s is a
maximum. This minimum value of a is the throat area, and the
pressure at this point, which causes V/s to be a maximum, will be
found to be about .58 px.
A calculation with numerical values will best illustrate the fore-
going.
Let the computations for V and j be made for various pres-
sures, for a nozzle expanding from 150 pounds pressure (abso-
lute) and dry saturated condition, to 15 pounds absolute. The
following table shows the different quantities as calculated.

On curve sheet (Fig. 2) the specific volumes (Column 7), ve-
locities (Column 4), and the values of V/s, are plotted with pres-
sures (Column 2) as abscissas. The curves of specific volume
and velocity show clearly how, during the early part of the expan-
sion, the velocity is increasing more rapidly than the specific vol-
ume; and during the latter part of the expansion the reverse is
true. So long as V increases faster than s, the area must decrease.
As soon as J commences to increase more rapidly than V, a must
begin to grow larger.
The curve of values of V/s shows a maximum at a pressure
between 85 to 90 pounds. The scale is too small to show the
exact pressure at which the maximum occurs. A larger scale
would show it to be about 87 pounds which is 58% of the initial
pressure (150 pounds). That is, the nozzle throat is at that point
along the nozzle where the pressure is 58% of the initial pressure.
Assuming the least value of a to be unity, the diameters of a
round nozzle, to give a uniform pressure drop, are shown in the
figure at the top of the curve sheet.

The nozzle has a convergent part, and a divergent part. The
convergent part takes care of the expansion from the initial pres-

sure, /&gt;,, to the pressure .58/&gt;,. The divergent part expands the
steam from this pressure to the back pressure.
The pressure at which V/s is a maximum, can be found math-
ematicallv as follows:


The expression for velocity in terms of the pressure, for adia-
batic expansion, is given by the equation of Zeuner
(See works on Thermodynamics and Steam Turbines; more es-
pecially Peabody's Thermodynamics of the Steam Engine, p. 151)
where V — the velocity in feet per second.
f&gt;x = initial pressure.
p = anv pressure to which the steam has expanded from
Pt-
J, = specific volume at px.
n = exponent for adiabatic expansion curve (for steam in-
itially dry and saturated n = 1.135).
Let p/pt= r, which is the only variable in the right hand side
of the equation.

To find the value of r which will give the maximum value for

dz/dr = Kj2z (1.76 r" — 1.879 rm) = o,
whence 1.76 r'6= 1.879 r'879-
and r = .938-"9 — .577
That is, the pressure at the section where a is least (throat)
&gt;s .577 Pi-
The ratio .577 depends upon the exponent n to some extent.
Zuener has shown that n depends upon the initial quality of the
steam. If the quality is taken as .90 (a very extreme case), then
n is 1.125 and the ratio r is .585, which is not much different from
its value for initially dry steam.
In practice, nozzles are not made in the form illustrated in
Fig. 2. In the first place, difficulty of manufacture in producing
the exact form would prohibit their use. In the second place, it
has been found by experiment that the above shape has no ad-
vantage in efficiency over the more simple and usual form shown
at the top of sheet in Fig. 3. A slight rounding of the edges on
the entrance side, sufficies for the converging part; while the di-
verging portion is rather long with straight taper sides.
The nozzle of Fig. 2 is designed for, and would give, equal
pressure drops for equal increments of length along its axis. The
nozzle of Fig. 3 gives a steam distribution far different from this.
The convergent portion being so short, an immense drop in pres-
sure must occur within a very short distance; while the converg-
ing part being long, the rate of pressure drop in it is small.
To illustrate the behavior of the steam, let the nozzle of Fig.
3 be given. Let the throat area be made the same as that of the
nozzle of Fig. 2, and let its diameter be taken as 1 inch. The in-
itial steam conditions arc the same, also, viz., 150 pounds absolute
pressure, and 100% quality. The end area of the nozzle of Fig.
3 is made as nearly as possible the same as that of Fig. 2 so that
the nozzles should expand to the same back pressure—15 pounds
absolute. It is desired to draw the curves of pressure, velocity,
and specific volume for the nozzle of Fig. 3,—length along its
axis being regarded as abscissas.
From the equation of continuity for the nozzle of Fig. 2, V/s


for the least value of a (i inch diameter) has the maximum value
of 307.4. Whence
W = 3°7-4 x 1 X 3.14 = ,.675 lbs.
4 X 144
The equation of continuity also holds good for the nozzle of
Fig- 3'
//* = J '1 (J1A1 = Vi a.Js, etc., and If = 1.675 lbs.
Knowing au a.,, t;.,, etc. (by scaling diameter of nozzle) we
can find values of V/s corresponding to various points along the
nozzle axis. With these values of J'/s refer to the curve of V/s
(Fig. 2,) and find the corresponding pressure, which may now be
plotted as a point on the pressure curve ( Fig. 3).
From Fig. 2 may be found the velocity corresponding to any
given pressure, and also the specific volume. The manner of plot-
ting the velocity and specific volume curves of Fig. 3 is then ob-
vious.
The value of the pressure, where the pressure curve crosses
the ordinate through the throat of the nozzle, is found to be about
87 pounds or 58% of the initial pressure.
In the first case considered, the areas for different points,
along the axis of the nozzle, were calculated to permit a uniform
rate of pressure drop. It was found that the least area had to
occur where the pressure was about .58 or 58% of the initial pres-
sure.
In the second case, the nozzle form was assumed, and the pres-
sures determined for different points along its length. And it
was found that at the place of least area (the throat) the pres-
sure, adjusting itself to its conditions, was again about 58% of
the initial pressure.
That is. stated generally, at the place of least cross sectional
area in a nozzle, the ratio of velocity to specific volume is a max-
imum. And, for steam, the pressure at which this condition is
fulfilled is about .58 of the initial pressure, when the hack pressure
is less than .j8 of the initial pressure.
For any other vapor or gas besides steam, the same general
relation holds true, but the value of the ratio is different.

SOME CONSIDERATIONS IN THE COMPUTATION OF
CONCRETE DAMS AND ECONOMICAL PRESSURE
PIPES FOR POWER DEVELOPMENT.
P. J. LEMMERZ, 09.
A.—The Concrete Dam.
This dam is to be built on a rock foundation, whose permea-
bility is estimated to be 50%. Although the dam is used to pro-
vide for a storage reservoir, it is agreed that the backwater mu§t
never rise higher than 44 feet about the datum gc (see Fig. 1).
From observations the highest water-level of the river has
been determined during many years and from this it has been
calculated that at the time of highest level the discharge over the
dam will be about 7070 ft.3 per sec. A survey of the river shows
that a spillway of 200 ft. seems to be practicable. In order to ob-
tain the greatest storage possible for the dry season, it is advisa-
ble to build the dam as high as possible and yet to provide for the
necessary discharge in time of flood.
Since the discharge of a dam varies with the shape of its crest
it is advisable to choose that shape, which will discharge the water
the easiest way. For this reason I chose the shape, which Profes-
sor Williams in his treatise on dams (Michigan Teciin'ic, June.
1910), calls type K. According to an accompanying table, Pro-
fessor Williams found experimentally that the discharge over this
type was x times the discharge over a sharp-edged weir, of the
same length, the same height, and under the same head. This
coefficient x varies with the head and is 1.177 for a 3J/2 ft. head
and 1.19 for a 4 ft. head.
The following data have been considered in the calculation of
the height of the dam:—
(1) That the water level must not be raised more than 44
feet above datum g c;
* This article is taken from a report on a power plant prepared by the
writer while doing special work in water power engineering leading to his
master's degree in Mechanical Engineering.


59
(2) that the maximum discharge will be the total quantity
delivered minus the quantity used by the turbines or 7070 — 680
— 6390 ft.3 per sec. (In case of accidental shutdown at time of
highest flood, the relief valves of the pipes may be opened, in or-
der to aid the necessary discharge.)
(3) that the dam should be as high as possible to obtain
maximum storage;
(4) that the spillway be 200 ft. wide.


The discharge over a sharp-edged weir according to Francis
formula is:—
Q = 3-33 L(h + v2/2g) 2, where
Q = discharge in ft.3 per sec.
L. — the length of the weir.
h =-the head over the dam in feet.
;■ = the mean velocity of the water at the point where the
head was measured (about 15 ft. from the clam up stream).
Neglecting the velocity of approach z*/2g which will intro-
duce a slight error on the safe side, and solving for h we have in
case of a sharp-edged weir:—
6390 =■"; 3.33 X 200 X li 2
/i 2 = 96; h --4-5
Using type K and solving again for h we have
1.19 9.6
h = Aft.
The height of the dam is therefore 44 — 4 = 40 ft. above
datum. For stability the dam has to be constructed in such a way
that the overturning forces do not exceed the righting forces. It
must also be so designed that at no time any portion of the con-
crete is subjected to tension.
For the purpose of calculating the overturning and righting
forces we take therefore moments about point o, the extreme
down-stream point of the middle third of the base.
Assuming a top-width of 8 ft. and an even down-stream slope
to the tailrace as indicated in the sketch, the width a b is found by
calculating all the overturning and righting moments about point
0: setting them equal to each other" and solving for a b as shown
in the calculations. In calculating the righting moments the
weight of the concrete is taken as 214 times the weight of water
Ui'). Since 50$ of the water percolates beneath the dam we
have an additional overturning force P (see sketch), which force
depends on the percent of percolation. The calculation has been
made as follows:


From the sketch it can be seen, that there is a difference in
head of 34 ft. between head and tailrace in time of flood. Neglect-
ing the overflow, which introduces an error on the safe side, this
difference is used up by the water to overcome the frictional re-
sistance offered by the foundation and is similar to a loss in head
due to the flow of water through pipes. From left to right we
have a loss of pressure-head (H — h) and this loss is distributed
over the distances c a, a b, b d. The upward pressure at a is there-

The Earth Dam.
The profiles show, that only the spillway has been made of con-
crete, the fills at the sides have been made of earth for the sake
of economy, for the calculations show, that an earthen dam of the


63
required height of 46 feet above datum is by far cheaper than a
concrete dam. It is also more lasting, for the concrete will crum-
ble in time while earth is not subject to disintegration. The only

danger to which an earthen dam, if properly constructed, is sub-
jected, is overtopping by flood; saturation of the mass by water
until the entire structure yields to the pressure of the water be-
hind it, and erosion of the slopes.
The most important requisite in the design of a dam of earth,
is to make it water tight. All kinds of earth, except clay and
vegetable loam, are more or less permeable to water. Through
gravel the water flows rapidly, through sand we have a steady
stream. It is therefore advisable to use earth of a clayey charac-
ter, at least for the center of the structure to form a puddle core.
This central core forms then a water-tight partition, while the
rest of the earth is to support this core against the pressure of the
water. There is an objection to pure clay puddles. When thev
dry they become cut up with cracks and leak, and thus fail to
serve their purpose. A mixture of about 20 to 30% clay and 70
80% gravel is considered very good. As it was supposed that
the proper mixture was not available for our dam, I followed the
common practice of proposing a masonry core wall near the cen-
ter of the earth dam, which, neglecting a small per cent of per-
colation is water-tight. If it is advisable to obtain absolute water
tightness this core wall may be constructed with a 1 in. or 2 in.
slot in its center, which slot is filled with melted asphalt.
The slopes of the earth fill must be protected against the ac-
tion of ice and waves. For this reason the up-stream side is paved
with broken stone from 4 feet below lowest level up to highest
water level. The down-stream side is sodded, and provided with
a 4 ft. wide offset, as shown in the sketch, in order to guard
against the effect of heavy rains.
The following table gives an approximate estimate of the cost
of the Concrete Dam and of the Earth Dam.

General Principles for the Construction of Earth Dams.
Although the design of construction of an earth dam is largely
affected by the nature of the material which is available, there
are certain principles, which according to good authorities must
be observed, whatever design may be adopted.
The detail of these principles may be summarized as follows:
Select a firm, dry, impermeable foundation, or make it so, by
excavation and drainage. All soil containing organic matter,
and all porous material should be excavated and removed from
the site, whenever practicable, that is, where the depth of a suit-
able foundation is not prohibited by excessive cost. Wherever
springs of water appear they must be carried from under the em-
bankment by drains or by pipes so laid and embedded as to form
a permanent and effective drainage system. The whole drainage
system must also be so designed, that it will ensure a free and
speedy outlet for any seepage water. All drains should be placed
on a firm, natural foundation wherever possible.
Unite the body of the embankment to the natural foundation
by means of an impervious material, durable and yet elastic
enough to bind the two together. Where the depth of a suitable
foundation proves to be too great a central trench may be exca-
vated. This trench should have sloping sides, extending to the
bed rock, or to another foundation, and should be filled with good
puddling material, properly compacted. Where clayey earth is
scarce or expensive to obtain, a small amount of clay-puddle con-
fined between masonry walls and extending well into the body of
the embankment may answer the same purpose and prevent seep-
age. A concrete corewall near the center of the dam, supported
by earth embankments on both sides may also be used to prevent
excessive seepage.
Always break the continuity of surfaces and avoid the forma-
tion of cavities and lines of cleavage. No excavation, to be re-
filled, should have vertical sides. Long continuous horizontal
planes should be intercepted by wedge-shaped offsets, enabling
dovetailing of materials. Loose rock or porous material should
be removed. Where the refill is not the best, the good and poor
should be mixed thoroughly before being deposited.


Base the preliminary calculations for designing the profile of
the earth dam on the following data:—
Weight of water = 62.4 lbs.; weight of earth = no lbs.; as-
sume coefficient of friction = i; factor of safety against sliding
not less than 10.
Aim at a homogeneous mass in the body of the embankment in
order to avoid unequal settlement and deformation.
Select earthy materials in preference to organic soils in order
to obtain a firm consolidation of the material, for consolidation is
the most important factor in building an earth dam. A mixture
of about 20 to 30% of clay and 80 to 70% of gravel is considered
as good a material as can be obtained. The consolidation must be
effected by heavy rolling. The material to be rolled must be
properly wetted. Too much or too little water or an uneven wet-
ting are equally bad. There are certain kinds of earth material
which no amount of wetting and rolling will compact. These
must be rejected as unfit for use in any portion of the dam.
B.—The Pipe Line.
It was stated in the problem that the available gross head is
485 feet and that the average available quantity of water is 680
cu. ft. per sec. All the electrical energy which can be obtained
has been contracted for 300 days a year of 12 hours each at a price
of ]/i cent per K.W. hr. It is therefore very important that in de-
signing the pipeline we shall make it in such a way, that we ob-
tain the most possible power with the least possible expense.
The efficiency of the pipe and therefore the income from the
available actual power developed increases with an increase of
diameter, for an increase of diameter lessens the loss due to fric-
tional resistance. On the other hand, an increased diameter calls
for thicker pipes. It therefore increases the weight and initial
cost of the pipe, and hence the yearly outlay will be larger.
Let us take into consideration for the present the pipeline
alone, disregarding the effect which the yearly outlay for dam,
water rights, powerhouse and machinery will have upon the solu-
tion of the problem.
Then we may say: Design the pipe in such a way that the
vearly loss in F.H.P. plus yearly outlay equals a minimum. In
the following discussion it will be shown that all items which de-


termine or modify the yearly loss in F.H.P. and the yearly outlay
can be expressed in terms of the diameter and pressure.
Let H be the given static head, and He= (k-\-i?)/2g be the
net head available for the turbines, when the quantity Q cu. ft. per
sec. is flowing. Then the friction head is //f = Hi — Ht.
Using '"Saph and Schoder" formula

material used.

For a given 0 therefore and any element of length, the friction
head may be expressed by
dhf = C»dl
(14-99
which shows that the head loss due to friction is a function of
the diameter and the length of the pipe.
The loss of d[ F.H.P.) = ( ° w dhf )l

where c is the combined efficiency of turbines and generators or
rather up to that point where the power is sold.

element of length will be

——-— or where A = C.C,. (I)
'dtM di''')
The total outlay or expense of the pipe depends on length,
pressure, diameter, nature and thickness of the material, initial
cost, interest, depreciation and repairs.
The material is determined by the nature of the problem.


For high head, large capacity pipes we use riveted steel pipes,
at least for that part of the line which is subjected to very high
stresses. In low head propositions the cast iron pipe, concrete or
wooden stave pipes are most frequently used.
Considering only cast iron and steel we find the thickness of
the material necessary from the equation:
/ = ^ where
12 X 2 X ' X/
t = thickness of the material in feet.
/&gt; = pressure in lbs. per sq. in.
d = diameter in feet.
/== efficiency of riveted joints in case of steel pipe.
^--^-the allowable working strength for the material used.
From the above equation we see at once that in as much as we
know the material used, the denominator is a given constant quan-
tity and the equation may be written t-~clpd, where
&lt;"« =
12X2X7 X/
The weight of the pipe per element is therefore
7i&gt; — :3.I4&lt;/dlctp rfr3 where c- is the weight of i cu. ft. of the
material used. Adding 10% for Manges, rivets, joints, etc., we
get
w= 1.1 X 3.i4cfdlctpdc.\ or if 3.14 X 1.1 =f«,
7v' = ctc-c„ p d- dl.
Pipe is bought by weight, and knowing the interest we have
to pay for the money invested and also the allowable outlay for
depreciation and repairs as a per centage of the money invested
we find the total cost — c4c.c^c7 p d'-dl, where c. is the combined
per centage we have to allow for interest, depreciation and re-
pairs.
Call ctc-c,.c7 = AT, we get the yearly outlay per pipe clement
= A',/- d-dl"or d (outlay)' Kjd-'dl (II)
Equation I and II hold good for any element of the pipeline.
If therefore anv element is most economical, the entire line will
be so.
Since for the most economical size the sum of the equations
I -f- II = minimum we have

From this equation we find d for any pressure desired.
Let us illustrate the case by the following numerical example.

The weight of the pipe per element of length is
n&gt; = 3.14 d dl X P d/ 216000 X 480 = .00698 p dr dl,
where 480 = lbs. of steel per cu. ft.
Adding 10% for rivets, joints, etc.. we obtain
w — 0.00768 f d~dl
Let the cost of pipe be 4c per pound, or 1/25 of a dollar, then
the cost per element = 0.00768 p d dl X 1/25 = 0.000307 p d2dl.
Let the yearly outlay for interest, depreciation, etc., be i2*/2%,
then the yearly outlay per element of line = 0.0000384/&gt; d-dl (II).
Since for the most economical size the sum of I + II must be

For p — 20072.31 = 86.6 lbs.; d = 10.15 ft.
For p = 300'/ 2.31 — 129.9 lbs.; d = 9.58 ft.
For /&gt; = 40072.31 = 173-2 lbs.; d = 9.18 ft.
For p — 48572.31 =209.9 lbs.; d = 8. 8 ft.
Fig. IV shows the curve drawn with various pressures in lbs.
per sq. in. as abscissa, and various diameters as ordinates. From
this curve wc see that for an increase in pressure the diameter de-
creases on a smooth curve, and since t is a function of p and d.
the thickness would have to increase with an increase of pressure
continually. Although a line built the way determined by the
curves would be most economical as far as material is concerned,
it would after all be very expensive to manufacture such a pipe-
line. We therefore split up the entire line into a number of sec-
tions with a constant diameter and constant thickness for each
section, taking for the determination of t the maximum pressure
to which the corresponding section is exposed. The number of
sections to be taken and the length for each may be determined by
the total fall, the grade of the line, the length of the line and by

practical considerations. In figuring the thickness for the part of
the pipe next to the dam, we must make special allowance for me-
chanical strength.
Let us for sake of illustration divide the pipe into 3 sections.
Section I 600 feet of 161 ft. fall.
Section II 900 feet of 162 ft. fall.
Section III 1100 feet of. 162 ft. fall.
The diameter for each section may be taken from curve (Fig.
IV):
Section I = 11.00 ft.
Section II = 9.75 ft.
Section III = 9.25 ft.
For the sake of economy let us subdivide each section into 2
parts of different thickness.
Length of sections and maximum pressures:
Section -I a = 300 feet with h max. 80.5 ft = 35 lbs. per sq. in.
Section I b = 300 feet with /1 max. 161 ft. = 69.8 lbs. per sq. in.
Section II a = 500 feet with h max: 242 ft. = 104.5 lbs. per sq. in.
Section lit = 400 feet with h max. 323 f t. = 140.0 lbs. per sq. in.
Section III 0=400 feet with h max. 404 ft. = 174.5 lbs. per sq. in.
Section III 6 = 700 feet with h max. 485 ft. = _&gt;io.o lbs. per sq. in.

rivets, etc., we get 6321260. lbs.
Cost of both pipes —6321260/25 = $252000.
Foregoing illustration is accurate only if we have to consider
a pipeline without taking consideration of the rest of the plant.
In practical problems of this kind however, the yearly outlay is
not determined by the cost of the pipe alone, but equally much
by the cost of dam, water rights, power house, machinery, etc.
While it is seldom possible to accurately predetermine the total
yearly expenses of the plant without the pipeline, it is always pos-
sible to obtain an approximate estimate. This item will enter the
equation as a new constant (say K.j,). It is seen at once that in a
great many cases the cost of the line is but a small fraction of the
total cost of the plant. In such cases K„ will be comparatively
large. It therefore will greatly modify the results calling for a
much smaller pipe diameter for most economical conditions.


EDITORIALS
This is the last issue of The Technic to be published under
the management of the present board of directors. While we
leave it entirely to the reader to judge and criticize our work, we
wish to add a word toward boosting the 1912 Technic. The
board for 1912 has been elected and we are sure that we are
leaving The Technic in capable hands. We know that they will
do their part well and we wish to ask that the reader help them
by patronizing our advertisers, and if they are advertisers by ad-
vertising in The Technic.
Next year The Technic will again be published as a semi-
annual. While we think a quarterly could be made a success from
an editorial standpoint, it requires more time and attention than
the students on the board can give to make it a financial success.
In leaving we wish to state that we hope to leave The Tech-
nic in far better shape than it was left to us. While we did not
succeed in publishing The Technic as early as we hoped to, we
have succeeded in raising money enough through advertising and
subscriptions, to nearly clear our debt.

Length
MEANS
Leather Strength
Everyone knows that the strength of any fabric is in direct propor-
tion to the length of its fibres.
Thus worsted cloth made of the longest hair, is superior to shoddy
stock made of short-fibred material.
But few stop to think that this applies even more to leather than to
a textile fabric. C And this is because the fibres of leather extend with
equal cohesiveness in all directions, while textile fibres merely run in the
direction of the w^ave or knit. G. For instance, you can take a hide of
leather and split it into several thicknesses or sheets of leather, all of
which will possess more or less strength.
But three thicknesses of leather split from a hide will not have
nearly as great a combined strength as the original hide possessed before
it was split, because the cohesion between the fibres connecting the splits
has been destroyed in the splitting, and is preserved in the original hide.
The illustration shows a piece of oak and one of VIM Mechanical
Leather torn to a breaking point, under similar conditions. &lt;LThe com-
parative length of fibre speaks for itself. C.VIM Leather is designed
for all mechanical uses.
It is made as hard as a brick or as soft as a glove.
It is made into belting, mill strapping, hydraulic packings, pneu-
matic packings, friction leathers, lace leather, textile aprons, auto-
mobile tires, and cut to size, moulded to shape, sewed, riveted, cemented,
made into solid wheels of any diameter up to sixty inches, and of any
number of thicknesses. C, In fact, things are done with leather in the
VIM Leather Shop that the average mechanical engineer would suppose
were impossible. C. So it would be well to get acquainted.
