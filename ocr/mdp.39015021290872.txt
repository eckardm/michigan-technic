Frank DeCaria holds a BS-ChE
from West Virginia University. He's twenty-four
years old and has worked at Du Pont's Old Hickory
plant near Nashville for just over two years now
When Frank joined Du Pont, he
immediately went to work on the start-up of a
new waste treatment plant. The resulting system
provides a cleaner environment for thousands
of bass, bluegill, and carp. In addition, his work
has helped concentrate trace quantities of scarce
materials to recoverable levels.
At the moment, Frank is a member
of a team working to make the waste
treatment plant even more efficient.
By 1983, he expects that the BOD
discharge rate will have been further
reduced to less than 10% of its
current level.
Frank's contribution is not
unique. Du Pont has a reputation
for getting young engineers into
the mainstream quickly.

The relationship between the
engineer and his environment
is a serious one. The engineer's
every action can help bring
Utopia or desolation to the
world. Therefore, the engineer
can no longer remain behind
the textbooks and in the lab,
but he is forced to live and
breath the world he helps
create.

With the onset of the new year, the Technic introduces
its staff and writers, so that they may be identified for
future reference and vigilante meetings. It has been
rumored that this hardened gang of desperadoes can be
located by frequent visits to 3077 East Engineering. For
your protection and safety, we will identify the most
dangerous members.
Editor-in-Chief Jim Epperson is returning for his third
year on the Technic. Jim spent his summer working for
the Navy and moonlighting as a washing machine sales-
man. We are told that the two are intimately connected.
As Editor-in-Chief, Jim will not only get to tell us what
to do, but he also keeps the profits from our most sought
after coffee machine. Good luck with the I.R.S., Jim!
Mary Goodreau returns to fill the post of coach of our
football team that will once again extend its ninety-year
winning streak over the Michigan Daily. (The streak would
be longer, but they couldn't get up a team in their early
years). Mary held a variety of jobs this summer, working
for the Engineering College at Chrysler Center as well as
serving as a consumer safety test driver of bicycles for
Ralph Nader. This last post also got her a part-time job at
the Dental School as a specimen when she expertly un-
covered a lemon.
Thorn Lahiff, last year's illiterate Photo Editor, returns
this year as our Associate Editor. Thorn, like the rest of
the Technic staff, had a busy summer. A man of many
talents. Thorn carried a full schedule this summer while
working part time as an Oral Surgeon at the Health
Center. Late one night, he was surprised to look down at
his operating chair and see Mary Goodreau, who had just
come in from her job as a bicycle test driver, with a
broken jaw. Since Mary and Thorn are good friends, she
not only got her mouth wired, but we understand that
she also gets excellent AM and FM reception.
Recently retired editor Lee Teschler has departed for
the West Coast, but he was kind enough to leave off his
article on professional engineering before heading out for
the Promised Land.
Mutad Cinchet is back for his second year, under
somewhat dire circumstances. At the time of printing,
Mutad has been sleeping in our office or sometimes in the
Arb, as the University has been unable to furnish him
with adequate housing. Mutad has refused to live in the
Bell Tower, since he sleeps with the window open and has
a tendency to sleepwalk.
Richard Jacobson, or "Jake," will replace Thorn as our
new head photographer. Jake first came to our attention
when we ran a feature on his voyage across the Atlantic
in a small boat with two other Michigan Engineers.
A few new faces have joined the Technic staff this
year (nobody warned them in time). Doug Johnson and
Jim Weingart were shanghaied off the streets of Ann Arbor
and held prisoner in the Technic office until they agreed
to work for us. After living on Coffee Manager Reg
Lewicki's wares for three days, they were in fine shape for
work in the rough world of technical journalism; besides
which, we needed bodies for our football team. Doug is
a still innocent and naive freshman, while Jim has pro-
gressed to the exalted height of sophomore. Welcome tc
the Technic, fellas!
So much for the 1974 edition of the Technic staph.
Hopefully we can live up to the great tradition that the
Technic has left behind us.

The American paroxysm known as Watergate has
apparently subsided, and the nation has proven that the
experiment begun almost 200 years ago can and does
work. Watergate of course will not disappear from the
scene entirely; it will emerge every now and then to
remind us that it was not just a bad dream, but an all too
real nightmare. But this column is not going to degenerate
into one of those homolies about how Watergate shows
the greatness of America, or how it shows the degradation
of America. The proper place for such commentary is in
the Washington Post or Newsweek, where better pens can
do a better job.
Yet it is still true that much can and should be learned
from the agonies of the last two years. We have seen a
group of men blithely break the law in an arrogant
campaign to perpetuate their own power, and to utterly
destroy all those who dared voice opposition. It is all too
apparent from this that power does indeed corrupt.
But what does this have to do with ourselves as
engineering students? In our world of equations and com-
puters, of what use is the input from Watergate? The
simplest retort is that Watergate is relevant to all
Americans whether they are in politics or not; but the
relevancy of the scandal to engineers goes much deeper
than that.
In our world of ever-increasing technology, the engi-
neer is branching out into other endeavors; he no longer
confines himself to enthalpies and entropies. At Michigan,
a number of programs set up for such purposes exist: the
general B.S. in engineering and the graduate program in
Public Systems Engineering are two that quickly come to
mind. Engineering methods and concepts are rapidly being
applied to socio-political problems. At the same time, the
education of the student engineer is becoming much more
diverse, permitting far greater exposure to, and more
knowledge of, social and political sciences. A hundred
years ago, the highest that an engineer might rise was
president of a railroad, but in the future, engineers will be
playing an increasing and vital role in government.
Here is our connection to Watergate. As engineers we
face increasing responsibilities outside of our traditional
fields. We can meet these responsibilities, indeed, we must
meet them in order to continue our role as problem-
solvers. Yet there is no room in this future for another
Watergate. For that reason, we, as well as all Americans,
must know full well the facts and lessons of the scandal;
it may be distasteful, it may try our faith in the basic
goodness of our country, but it must be done. Those who
fail to study the past and learn from it, are indeed
doomed to repeat its mistakes.


"... America has experienced phenomenal growth in the
past 200 years, largely due to an abundant supply of
cheap energy and natural resources. Now both are dwind-
ling exponentially."
With the firing of the first guns along the Suez Canal
last October, that famous episode in American history
known as the Energy Crisis began to take form. The
creeping rise in gasoline prices and general fuel costs
became a runaway rocket that may never return to earth.
Although a general Resources Shortage in this country
had been lurking around the corner for some time, its
arrival was certainly hastened by the Yom Kippur War
and its concomitant Arab oil embargo.
The American demand for energy, and in particular
petroleum, had been exceeding domestic supply for
several years, and the shortfall had been rapidly increasing
since 1970 (ref. (a)). Projections made in the early '70s
indicated that American dependence on Mid-East oil
would rise from 23 percent to 40 percent of consumption
by 1980 (ref. (b)). The figures were there to be seen, but
apparently nothing was done about them. Despite cries to
the contrary, the political use of their oil by the Arab
states should have been foreseen, and contingency plans
developed to deal with it. But the Arab embargo was only
a part, albeit an important one, of the problem. Domestic
oil exploration had been drastically curtailed in recent
years, and our refining capacity held at a low level. Blame
for these acts of omission is variously distributed, depend-
ing upon your point of view. The oil companies claim
that efforts toward domestic exploitation were pro-
hibitively expensive relative to costs in the Middle East,
except in Alaska, where transportation problems have still
not been solved; or along the Continental Shelf, an area
where drilling had been prohibited due to environmental
considerations. Critics of the petroleum corporations
claim otherwise, blaming tax incentives for encouraging
the investment of exploration money overseas (ref. (c)).
The only thing clear about this aspect of the issue is that
it is not at all clear. Perhaps it is even irrelevant, since the
task is now to somehow bring domestic energy pro-
duction up to demand, or vice-versa.
The Energy Crisis could never have paralyzed this
nation had America not been so petroleum dependent as
it was. Despite warnings of as long ago as the 1920s,
research into alternate fuels was scarce, and poorly fund-
ed. Not until the prospect of nuclear energy became real
did extensive study of alternate, non-fossil fuels begin.
The whys of this sad research gap may only be surmised.
Certainly the oil companies stood (and still stand) to lose
much should their product be replaced as the Energy
King. But perhaps more importantly, the petroleum-based
economy had acquired too much inertia to be rapidly
changed. It had become self-perpetuating.


production up to demand levels:
1) New, innovative systems of energy production must
be developed to replace petroleum. Although studies
exist that show it possible to close the gap between
supply and demand with present coal and oil resources
(ref. (a)), the more positive and farsighted approach
would veer away from our present dependence on
fossil fuels.
2) The economic inertia of the petroleum-based
society must be overcome to allow the large-scale imp-
lementation of the new systems developed. This may
prove to be the harder of the two objectives to reach.
While technology can at times progress rapidly, society
as a whole has always resisted changes.
The second task above is basically a social and eco-
nomic problem, while the first is definitely an engineering
problem. The great engineering goal of the last '70s and
early '80s will be to design, perfect, and produce systems
of energy production that can largely supplant oil as the
main fuel for America. This is not to say that the second
task should be ignored by the engineer, for if he is not
sensitive to the needs of society the resistance to change
in that society will inevitably increase.
But energy is not the only quantity in short supply. In
the wake of America's industrial growth, a ravenous
appetite for consumption has all but eliminated many
vital natural resources. An engineer is a creature of his
resources, in fact he is a captive of them. America has
experienced phenomenal growth in the past 200 years,
largely due to an abundant supply of cheap energy and
natural resources. Now both are dwindling exponentially.
A new regimen of careful consumption and conservation
is vital to any effort to close the energy gap. At the same
time that the engineer is devising new energy sources, he
must be careful hot to provoke or encourage the rape of
what is left of this country's resources. Here, government
must enter the picture to impose strong but reasonable
constraints on the use of resources, while openly en-
couraging the recycling of virtually all waste material.
There it is; the challenge has been made, and it is left
to the engineer to pick up the gauntlet and accept the
test of the future. As prospective engineers, we must
accept our part in the task ahead. There is no real choice;
it must be done.

Some companies still start you off
with a number of weeks of training

in one department. A number in
another. And so on.
Not Celanese. We're still growing
too fast to fuss with that sort of thing.
We won't crank you through a
long, tedious training program.
You'll be assigned immediately to a
project, one that tests and develops
your skills. It's your project. Your
responsibility. If you need help, you'll
get it. But nobody will be breathing
down your neck. This means, of
course, that you're judged entirely
on performance. And grow as fast
as your ability allows.
If you're a mechanical or chemical
engineer, or chemist who'd welcome
this kind of professional freedom,
we'd especially like to talk to you now.
We'll tell you that Celanese ranks
among the top five U.S. chemical
companies. That sales are over 1.5
billion dollars annually. That we
have large and expanding stakes in
four important high-technology in-
dustries—fibers, chemicals, plastics
and coatings. That, although our re-
sources are great, our day-to-day
operations are highly decentralized.
That you'll find a shirt-sleeve, first-

t LAN COC An equal opportunity employer m/f


by Lee Teschler, '74
Mr. John S. Loam, Professional Engineer, is an exam-
iner for professional engineering registration in the state
of Massachusetts. It was a dark and grippy day last fall
when, during an oral examination, he had the following
conversation with someone describing himself as an
"amusement engineer" and claiming to be a leading
expert on the design of roller coasters:
LOAM: How do you calculate the stress in the structure?
Answer: I know from experience how large to make the
pieces.
LOAM: What calculations do you make?
Answer: I have a formula in my office for the force of a
car going over a curve.
LOAM: Do you employ any other formulas?
Answer: No, sir. That is the only one I need.
LOAM: What factor of safety do you use?
Answer: About 90%.
LOAM: Do you mean that your factor of safety is less
than unity?
Answer: Yes, sir, less than unity.
LOAM: Why do you do that?
Answer: To give the customers a bigger thrill. They have
to hold on when they go over the curves.
LOAM: Isn't that rather dangerous?
Answer: No. When a car is going fast, you don't need
100% safety. You get across before anything happens.
LOAM:!!
The above applicant had "designed" huge roller coasters
in many amusement parks and fairs.
Engineer Loam is fictional, but the incident just re-
lated actually happened. Occasions like this are living
proof that policing is necessary in engineering. It was this,
weeding out incompetents, that instigated engineering
registration. Registration of engineers first came about in
the 1800s after a long legal fight. It was common practice
back then for politicians to reward campaign bosses by
appointing them to engineering offices for which they had
no qualifications whatsoever. All states now require some
sort of legal registration for anyone engaged in a pro-
fessional occupation, including engineering.
Now, it is possible for someone to get a job utilizing
his professional skills and not need to be legally register-
ed. For example, a graduate of law school can get a job
working in a law office and do general office work in-
cluding researching cases that will be processed by pro-
fessional lawyers. But he personally cannot offer his ser-
vices as a professional man without being legally register-
ed.
There is a similar situation with the engineer. Specific-
ally:
1. He may graduate from an accredited engineering
school, but in most states he cannot legally use the title
"Engineer" on a calling card unless he's registered in that
state. Last year in New York City alone 105 listings of
unregistered persons as engineers were eliminated from
the telephone book. Two hundred similar violations in
advertising were corrected without court action.1 How-
ever, in Michigan, practically anyone can describe himself
as an engineer or an engineering firm, as long as he
doesn't claim to be a "Registered Engineer."

to senior engineer status must be registered.
3. In some states (but not Michigan) anyone engaged in
engineering consulting work must be registered, or he
cannot legally accept this type of work.
4. In bidding for contracts, many engineering firms list
P.E.s as being responsible for their projects. The licensed
engineer obviously has an advantage in these firms.
5. When hard times hit, having P.E. status may mean the
difference between getting a job and eating your sliderule.
In spite of these rather cogent reasons for registration,
the majority of engineers graduating from U of M do not
attempt to register. Professor E. A. Glysson, the Univer-
sity's liaison with the Michigan Board of Registration for
Engineers, is extremely vocal on this subject.
"It's a sad fact that some people graduate from engi-
neering school not knowing their elbow from a light
switch, and there has to be some way of protecting the
public from these individuals," he says, only half joking.
"Seriously, anyone that professes to be an engineer must
be registered to do so. The fact that this isn't brought out
in school reflects a lack of understanding more on the
part of the faculty than on the part of the students."
"The dearth of registered professionals on the faculty
is one reason why professionalism isn't strong here," con-
tinues Prof. Glysson.
Professor Glysson's point is well taken. In the ECE
department, the largest department in the college, only
two active faculty members are registered professionals in
Michigan.
But the empirical evidence is that registration is of
miniscule importance in many areas of the profession.
Out of curiosity, Technic conducted an informal tele-
phone survey of several local engineering firms and engi-
neers listed in the phone book. Twenty-one firms were
approached and asked how many registered professional
engineers were on their staff. The results of this poll were
very revealing.
"It's a sad fact that some people graduate from
engineering school not knowing their
elbow from a light switch
Out of the 21 firms, nine had at least one (and in
many cases, only one) registered engineer. But of these
nine firms, all but one did exclusively public sector type
work in civil, structural, mechanical, surveying, or electri-
cal power engineering and consulting. The one firm not in
this area of engineering was a one-man electronics firm. In
a short talk with this fellow, he admitted: "Of all the
projects that I've submitted bids on, not once have I ever
been asked if I was a registered engineer."
Once outside the area of public domain, the percentage
of registered engineers drops off exponentially. None of
the companies we talked to that were involved in in-
dustrial type engineering employed registered engineers.
The conversations we had with some of these people
really began to get spastic. One firm in design and auto-
mation didn't even know what we meant by "registered
engineer." We were told by another rather large firm in
the area that, frankly, they really didn't care if any of
their engineers were registered or not. Finally we were
surprised when a firm that designs and manufactures med-
ical instrumentation for hospitals told us that none of
their seven engineers was registered. One would think, just
off hand, that the design of medical instrumentation for
public hospitals would very definitely require some proof
of professionalism.
We found that a good percentage of firms listing them-
selves as engineering consultants did not have a registered
engineer on the payroll. This is highly illegal in most
states, but in Michigan the statute states that firms and
individuals can legally incorporate the word "engineering"
or "engineer" into their title as long as they do not
falsely claim to be "registered engineers."
THE FUNDAMENTALS
The first step toward professional registration is passing
the Engineering Fundamentals Test. This test is eight
hours long and open book. The character of this test has
changed in recent years. Up to about five years ago the
fundamentals exam in Michigan was a specialized test;
electrical engineers took an electrical test, civil engineers a
civil engineering test, etc. Now, all designations have been
removed. The National Council for Engineering Examiners
now makes up a standardized fundamentals test for all
states except Colorado, Illinois, New Jersey and Con-
necticut. The test is now completely general and covers
all basic areas of engineering.
This generalized test came about as a result of nation-
wide efforts at standardizing engineering registration. The
argument for the general exam over a more specialized
one is simply that any engineer worth his salt should have
a good grasp of engineering fundamentals to really com-
petently apply knowledge of his own specialty.
This situation has not proved to be entirely satisfac-
tory, however. There are those in engineering circles that
claim the public is not being protected as much as it
should under the generalized system. It was thought,
when the generalized system first went through, that
engineers would be professionally ethical enough not to
practice out of their field. Unfortunately this has not
been the case. The unspecific title "Professional Engineer"
has given rise to incidents of people trained in one area of
engineering undertaking projects plainly out of their field,
projects they're just not qualified to do. But their title is
unspecific and hence their name on an engineering project
is strictly legal.
But don't expect a change in test criterion. For, if a
specialized test were again administered, the examination
boards would have to grapple with the knotty problem of
exactly how to make up sufficiently specialized tests. Just
how specialized could tests be made, in all fairness? And
how many such tests would have to be evolved? Special-
ization in engineering today is so diversified that each of
the classical engineering fields consists of microcosms
utterly divorced from anything else in the field. How to
generate fundamentals tests for structures like this is
uniquely perplexing.


The fundamentals test is divided into two four-hour
parts. The stated purpose of the morning session is to
access competency in fundamental engineering subjects
like math, statics, dynamics, thermodynamics, materials
sciences, electrical theory, fluid mechanics, chemistry, and
engineering economics. Questions on all subjects normally
connected with requirements for fundamentals in engi-
neering education are included. There are 150 questions
on this part, but only the first 100 correct answers are
counted toward the final score. That is, if you happened
to complete 130 questions, and 110 of those were cor-
rect, your score would be 100 for the morning, a perfect
score. If you completed 125 questions and got 90 correct,
your score for the morning would be 90.
The afternoon session holds in store three problem sets
in each of the following subjects: engineering economics,
dynamics, material mechanics, thermodynamics, electrical
theory, statics, and fluid mechanics; twenty-one problem
sets in seven subjects. Each problem set consists of intro-
ductory information followed by ten problems. Only five
of the twenty-one problem sets are graded. Problem sets
in at least four major areas must be worked, but only one
problem set in engineering economics will be graded.
A passing grade in the fundamentals test is 70%. But
the test is graded on a curve so a grade of 70% isn't a
direct measurement of achievement. This means that a
passing grade in one state could be a failing grade in
another, even though both states administered the same
test. All exams are machine graded in California by
NCEE. The results are analyzed there to determine stand-
ard means, deviations, bell curves, but the passing grade
for each particular state is established by the board in
that state.
'One firm in design and automation
didn't even know what we meant
by "registered engineer".'
What exactly are the questions like? Speaking as one
who has taken the test, most material comes from the
first three years of the undergrad curriculum. Some
people find that the concepts learned back in AM 211
have faded into fuzziness by the time senior year rolls
around. When this author took the test, there were quite
a few older, grungy looking characters there, and not
many students. I remember, before the test, overhearing
things like "You here again too, huh?" "Yup, and for the
last time, I hope." I also remember the morning session;
all the "kids" whizzed merrily through the calculus prob-
lems (one I remember was "take d/dx of x+2x") while I
noticed the older members of the group thumbing
through the calculus books they'd brought along. The
morning session was not terribly difficult, and I believe I
finished all but a few of the 150 problems.

The afternoon session was something else again. A
friend of mine summed it up nicely when he said at 5
o'clock, "Well, I sure hope I did well on the morning
part!" I can safely say that the afternoon was a bit more
difficult, especially for an EE that saw his last dynamics
course two years before. But I'm sure that any competent
ME or CE could have rifled through with relative ease.
And anyone in Applied Mechanics would've had it made.
A few general impressions, then, from an obviously
biased EE: The statics problems were extraordinarily hard
I thought, and most of the people I talked to afterward
seemed to agree. I never saw anything quite so complex
in AM 211. The dynamics, on the other hand, were
reasonable, and only basic physics were used on one set.
Almost everyone had worked at least one dynamics set.
The thermo was difficult in places; there was one problem
that wanted to know things about the Otto cycle that I
never heard of and that I couldn't even find in my
Sonntag and Van Wylen. But there was another problem
that could be worked using the ideal gas approximation,
and most people said they had tried it. The electrical
engineering set was ultimately fair, I thought. One prob-
lem set concerned an RLC circuit, something any idiot
could have handled. Another concerned a FET gate cir-
cuit for those whose forte was electronics, and a distribu-
ted loading problem for electrical power people. And so it
went. The material mechanics was almost a complete
mystery to me—MM 250 was a long time ago. I glanced
at the fluids problems, shuddered, and turned the page.

The next and final step in registration occurs after five
years of engineering practice. A typical final exam
question: Explain each step of a certain engineering pro-
ject specifically from original conception to completion.
A good answer would include design assumptions, abstract
statements, legal encroachments, and project structure.
This second exam is nonuniform, and is made up and
graded by the local registration board. On this part of the
test, the applicant designates whether he is an electrical,
mechanical or whatever engineer, and his exam is graded
by an examiner of that discipline. The graders are them-
selves registered professionals who are considered out-
standing in their field. These are usually heads of con-
'There are those in engineering circles
that claim the public is not being protected
as much as it should...'
suiting engineering firms, and their grading is purely sub-
jective, based on their own engineering judgment. Criti-
cism of this part of the exam stems from the fact that it
is so heavily oriented toward consulting engineering, since
it requires knowledge of precisely the things used by
consulting engineers.
But it is the opinion of this author that we will never
see widespread registration unless there is legislation
making it required beyond the public sector. The cards
are on the table. In engineering companies dealing in the
public domain, probably 90% of the engineers are register-
ed. But up until now, it just hasn't been important in
other areas of engineering. Most large engineering firms
put emphasis on continuing technical education for their
engineers, and the public relations material from these
companies often reflects this. But you won't find mention
of obtaining Professional Engineer status in one in fifty of
them. As long as this attitude persists, and it will persist
as long as it is not changed legally, P.E.s will be in the
minority.
Nevertheless, a Professional Engineer's certificate is
more than just another piece of paper to hang in the
office, as Prof. Glysson will reiterate: "Big corporations
hire engineering technicians, not professional engineers.
Quite often it works this way: Someone will go into
industry unregistered. He will progress until he finds that
he can't be promoted to a higher position in the company
unless he is a registered engineer. Unfortunately, he quite
often finds that by that time he has a hard time passing
the fundamentals test. Nobody can be sure of what they
will be doing five or ten years from now. The recom-
mended procedure is to take the fundamentals test while
the material is fresh, and keep it on file until you need to
have it."
Amen.

the prddent use of asphalt
paving, especially in these
energy-short days.
For example, asphalt con-

designing paving. For flexible
designing like stage construction,
putting down a base now and the
surface later. Asphalt's the ideal
rehabilitation material, too, for
maintaining present roads.
So the civil engineer who knows

Only Hewlett- Packard offers it.
In 1928 a Polish mathematician, Dr. Jan
Lukasiewicz, invented a parenthesis-free but
unambiguous language. As it's evolved over the
years it's come to be known as Reverse Polish
Notation (RPN), and it's become a standard
language of computer science.
Today, it's the only language that allows you to
"speak" with total consistency to a pocket-sized
calculator. And the only pocket-sized calculators
that use it are Hewlett-Packard's
[ENTER+I is the key to RPN because it enables
you to load data into a 4-Register Operational
Stack with the following consequences:
J# You can always enter data the same way,
i.e. from left to right, the natural way to read
any expression.
2#You can always proceed through your problem
the same way. Once you've entered a number
you ask: "Can I operate?" If yes, you perform
the operation. If no, you press |ENTERt| and
key in the next number.
^3#You can see all intermediate data anytime, so
you can check the progress of your calcula-
tions as you go.
4#You almost never have to re-enter intermediate
answers —a real time-saver, especially when
your data have eight or nine digits each.
5«^0U don't have to think your problem all the
way through beforehand to determine the best
method of approach.
Q#You can easily recover from errors since each
operation is performed sequentially, imme-
diately after pressing the appropriate key, and
all data stored in the calculator can be easily
reviewed.

Most of the students in the Engineering College have
probably seen it, and not really taken much notice. It is
an unobtrusive little office-laboratory located on the first
floor of East Engineering. In fact, it might well be mis-
taken for a laboratory like any other that the College
maintains. Yet the lab in 1516 East Engin. is anything
but ordinary, and the man who operates it is nothing
short of remarkable. The man is A. D. Moore, Professor
Emeritus in the E.C.E. Dept., and together with his labor-
atory he is one of the most interesting of people on
campus. In the course of his long and extremely pro-
ductive life, A. D. has made numerous contributions to
education and engineering, continuing right up to today.
A. D. was born in Fairchance, an aptly named town in
the coal fields of southwestern Pennsylvania. Prof. Moore
grew up on a farm, and to this day he keeps "farmer's
hours": he still gets up at about 4:30 to bicycle in to
East Engineering! He was graduated from Uniontown
High School at the age of 16, and entered Carnegie Tech,
where he took his B.S. degree at the tender age of 20.
After a year with Westinghouse he came to Ann Arbor as
a new member of the E.E. faculty.
The University was much smaller in those days-only
about 10,000 total students, and only eight E.E.s (how
times have changed!). The curriculum was slightly
different, too; electrical engineers learned about things
that are today taken for granted: transformers, tele-
phones, and power generators. Transistors? "What did you
say, son?"
Besides teaching his course in Electrical Design, A. D.
managed to get into other things as well, including the
pages of the Technic, where his articles, "A. D. Moore
Comments" were a regular feature back in the thirties.
Prior to this, however, he had begun his long and produc-
tive association with Tau Beta Pi, the national engineering
honorary society. He was elected by the new chapter at
his alma mater, Carnegie Tech, but the Michigan Gamma
chapter inducted him here, in 1916; in 1923 he was
elected to the Executive Council as national vice-
president, and things began to happen. The Council mem-
bers, all from different schools, were never able to meet
to get anything done. Consequently, the Tau Beta Pi
finances were in deep distress, and the Association in
general in disarray. Enter A. D. Moore. At the 1924
Convention he devised the present "package Council"
system, whereby the Council is elected as a whole rather
than as indiviauls. Not surprisingly, the Michigan Gamma
slate of H. H. Higbie, C. T. Johnson and A. D. Moore was
the first such Council elected. Again, not surprisingly,
A. D. Moore was chosen as national president; he served
two full terms, 1924-1927 and 1927-1930. Under his
leadership the struggling organization prospered. The
finances were brought back into the black; in 1925, he
helped found, together with five other organizations, the
Association of College Honor Societies, and served a term
as president of that group. A. D. Also created the Tau
Beta Pi Fellowship Program, which each year provides
financial assistance to Tau Beta Pi members for graduate
work.
After "retiring" as President, Prof. Moore continued to
serve Tau Beta Pi. He was appointed Director of Alumni
Affairs for 1931-1932, and continued in his position as
permanent Convention Chairman, a post he first held in
1923, until 1954. Finding himself with some "free time,"

Prof. Moore's Electrostatics Demonstration consists
of several small demonstration experiments which illustrate
the various uses of electrostatic phenomena and the many
ways in which static charges can act. His generators are all
self-designed and hand made; the first one, Dirod I, is still
operating, and he has improved upon the design to the point
where he can now build up static charges of up to 85,000
volts.
Most of the experiments are variations on a single
theme: inducing movement with opposing static charges.
This takes the form of spinning plastic wheels, or bouncing
coated ping-pong balls between charged plates. While the
experiments themselves seem rather harmless, they are
highly illustrative of the principles of electrostatics, prin-
ciples which are given rather cursory treatment in present-
day education, despite the growing use of static charges
in industrial applications.
Not surprisingly, the most interesting demonstrations
are those that illustrate the applicable phenomena. In one,
A.D. blows cigarette smoke into a small jar; the top
and sides are connected through electrodes to a generator.
and the generator is turned on. In about half a second,
the grayish-white smoke has disappeared from the jar. This
same idea, applied on a much larger scale, is used to clean
the flyash from industrial smoke. A similar experiment
separates an oil-water mixture in about 2-3 seconds, and a
third separates a set of conducting steel pellets from a set
of non-conducting plastic ones. Both of these methods
are widely used in mineral separation processes today, and
have been for some time.
A.D. Moore is quite rightly regarded as the eminent
authority on electrostatics in the United States even to this
day. The Coast Guard has asked him to study the problem
of electrostatic charges triggering explosions in oil tankers
Apparently, the fine water spray that is used to wash the oil
will explode. So, this past summer, A.D. went to Washing-
ton, D.C. and to the Coast Guard Academy in New London,
Connecticut, to work on the problem. He seems to be doing
more work in retirement than most men do in their prime.
Maybe it's the static charges that he picks up in his lab that
keep him going. Or maybe it is just because A.D. Moore gets
such a charge out of life.


Arbor City Council from 1940 to 1957.
Prof. Moore retired from active teaching in 1963, but
he by no means is inactive himself. His boyhood interest
in electrostatic phenomena was reopened by an article in
Scientific American, and one thing just led naturally to
another. A. D. has designed and constructed an entire
series of electrostatic demonstration experiments, and has
incorporated them into a traveling Lecture-Demonstration
show, which has been taken to schools and colleges all
across the United States, and even went to England. The
demonstrations seem inocuous enough in themselves,
showing such things as a small figure being suspended
between charged plates, accelerating charged ping-pong
balls and the like. However, A. D. assured me that there is
more to electrostatics than cute demonstrations. "The
very first large scale anti-pollution system used electro-
statics," he explained. The emissions from large industrial
smokestacks are eliminated by electrostatic precipitation
of flyash in the smoke. Prof. Moore showed me a small-
scale demonstration with a cigarette; the article that he
published in Scientific American has more dramatic
photos of its use in industrial plants.
Speaking of writing, A. D. has published, in addition to
the article in the March 1972 Scientific American, three
books, one on creativity (a favorite subject of his) called
Invention, Discovery and Creativity (Doubleday, 1969);
and two books on electrostatics: Electrostatics (Double-
day, 1969), and Electrostatics and Its Applications (Wiley,
1973). The last of these is the first professional level text
on the subject; A. D. edited it, enlisting contributions
from 17 experts for the bulk of the text.
Prof. Moore's Lecture Series and books have easily
made him the pre-eminent authority on electrostatics in
the United States, and led him to found the Electrostatic
Society of America in 1970. He continues to correspond
with many of his friends, including many students who
have seen his electrostatics demonstration, and want to
know more. Prof. Moore has a great interest in the educa-
tional process, and he encourages these students he meets
to get a good education. This concern has led him to
deplore the exponential growth of the American univer-
sity, particularly Michigan. The mega-university is not
producing the quality education that was the par in his
time. "I think it's insane—not the way to run the busi-
ness," he'says. A friendly man, he is willing to run
through his demonstration for almost anyone who pokes
his nose inside his lab—even Technic reporters, which
shows a high degree of tolerance on his part.
Along the way from Fairchance, Pa., to Ann Arbor,
Ml, A. D. has made several stops on the lecture circuit,
frequently serving as toastmaster at Tau Beta Pi functions,
where his ready wit and knack for turning a story stand
him in good stead. He also has been known to take up
the pool cue and juggling balls-the latter talent being
displayed in several matches with Willie Hoppe and
Charlie Peterson, two well known billiards champions. He
even wrote a short unpublished monograph on The
Mechanics of Billiards and Analysis of Willie Hoppe's
Stroke. But lately he has gotten out of practice in both
his billiards and juggling—being retired, he doesn't have
the time.

With the United States shooting for total energy
independence by 1985, engineers must accept the respon-
sibility of finding new sources of energy. Coal, oil, and
natural gas resources are due to run out sooner or later,
and hydro-electric power only supplies the U.S. with a
small fraction of its total energy consumption. The
engineers of today and tomorrow must concentrate their
efforts towards new, underdeveloped forms of energy,
such as nuclear power, solar power, hydrogen power and
.. . wind-power.
Harnessing the energy of moving air is nothing new.
In the early to middle 20th century, farmers depended on
wind-power for feeding their cattle, and milling their grain.
Sailboats, of course, have been utilizing wind-power for
thousands of years. But serious research into wind-power
as a practical energy source for the United States has not
been considered until recently.
In Europe, however, several large plants (200 kwatt,
for example) are in use, and work is being done on develop-
ing self-regulated wind-power systems that can be part of a
public power network. The problem here is to guarantee
a constant frequency A.C. output and to provide for out-
put compensation on relatively calm days. In the U.S., how-
ever, not much work has been done since the war, when a
1,250 kw plant was operating as part of the public power
network in Vermont.
The oil embargo and the energy shortage have made
American Scientists take another look at wind-power. Re-
cent history has seen several hundred units pop up all over
the U.S., ranging from generators built to supply electricity
to one home, to a group of homes, to a 100kw model being
developed by NASA.
Currently two basic lines of thought are being
brought into wind-power research. First, single home units
utilizing a generator, storage batteries, and a power inverter:
The wind is harnessed by using a propeller, such as is used
on an airplane: this propeller must be reasonably efficient
so as to transform the wind into a circular motion (a
necessary requirement for all conventional wind-power
machines). The propeller would drive an alternator that
would produce a constant D.C. voltage output. The D.C.
voltage would be fed into a power inverter whose output
would be 120 volts A.C. The batteries would be used during
periods of little or no wind. The above unit would be used
for a single home, or possibly multi-home instillations.
Second, wind turbines utilizing a governer that would
keep the frequency of the generated current at an almost
constant 60 Hz. This type of setup would probably re-
quire solar, or conventional power sources as a backup for
times of calm.
The engineer must direct his work towards new de-
signs for propellers, and turbines, along with compatible
power systems to deliver much needed electricity without
any damage to his environment.
The major stumbling block slowing the development
of wind-electric-power is cost. The typical American home
will require several thousand kilowatts of power. The cost
of storage batteries, power inverters, alternater, fan, tower
and other hardware would put this type of capital invest-
ment out of reach for the average American family, even
though long-term costs would be much lower than present
electric bills.
The power companies so far are unwilling to put up
any large initial investment towards wind-power research
and development. They do not want to take a risk that it
will bomb. The big money will probably come when the
engineers manage to boost up the efficiency of these units
over the current 37 percent ceiling.
The naturally occurring air currents represent a new
challenge to today's engineers. Wind represents a new source
of electric power without any ecological fallout. What a
pity that man has never before turned to this untapped
form of energy.

people are trying to return to the fifties. The Technic is
not just following the trend but going beyond it to the
late 1880s. In the issues to come, we will be running
glimpses of the past Technics to let you know what the
students of past years worked on and thought about.
To give you an understanding for these articles, a short
history of the Technic is in order. The Technic is the
oldest publication on campus and is also the oldest Engi-
neering College Magazine in the country. The first actual
magazine bearing the title The Technic is dated 1887, but
there was a bound volume of "papers presented before
the Engineering Society of the University of Michigan in
1882-1883." This gives rise to the claim that the Technic
Advisory Board decided to continue publication. This is
the same system that we use today.
Until the late 1960s the Technic supported itself by
subscriptions and ads, but for the last few years the
Technic has survived by the sale of ads to both national
and local companies, revenue from subscriptions not being
worth the effort.
Besides publishing a magazine, the Technic entered the
social life of the students by sponsoring the "Slide Rule
Ball," featuring big name dance bands (in 1940 Woody
Herman performed, which would be equivalent to having
Chicago or some other big name group nowadays). For
approximately 23 years the Technic sponsored this
formal.

was founded in 1882. At this point in time every engi-
neering student was a member of the Engineering Society,
which published the Technic as an annual, presenting a
program for the year, biographies of various faculty mem-
bers, and authoritative technical articles by both students
and faculty members which came from papers submitted
to the Society. As the enrollment of the college increased,
the activities of the Society increased, and the magazine
also grew. From an annual, it became a semi-annual, then
a quarterly and finally a monthly publication. The
Society published the Technic until 1923 when it died.
At this point an independent student staff with a Faculty
Engineers today carry out some of the same traditions
of yesteryear, although less formally. Announced each
year in the Technic was the Engineer's Smoker sponsored
by the Engine Council, something that the prestigious
Engine Council Social Committee should take note of.

How good are you
on the turns?
A strong stroke isn't enough to win in freestyle swimming.
Experts say: "Watch the turns."
"A champion won't touch with his hand," they tell us. "He begins his
overhead tumble with a downward stab of his right arm, twists as his feet
hit, then explodes forward with a powerful pushoff."
Their conclusion: "Experience and smart coaching develop a championship turn."
We believe it. That's why we've put together the most experienced and
best-coached team of bearing and steel engineers in the world. And we're
constantly expanding and modernizing for the future.
This coupled with promotion from within will mean increasing opportunities

But for millions even this
epicurean nightmare would be a

is one of the major problems facing
many people in the world.
And helping nations produce
more food is something FMC can
do very well
V\fe can engineer giant land
reclamation programs.
To increase agricultural
production we make machines that
prepare the soil and plant the seeds,
enabling large acreages to be
worked efficiently
To protect the crop from pests
and disease we produce special
agricultural chemicals, such as
Furadanf an insecticide-nematocide
that's boosting the yields of rice,
alfalfa, corn, peanuts and
sugarcane.
\Afe make
for special crops such as.tomatoes,
corn; peas and beans and-to help
make low-cost food possible, we
make automatic food canning and
freezing equipment,
We even design machines to,
form and fill bags and boxes, ana!
manufacture many types of
transparent films for packaging.
And while we don't have the final
solution to the hunger problem, we
do offer more ways and means of
growing, harvesting, processing
and packaging food than any other
single company in the world.
Helping to feed hungry people
is one of our major concerns, but
it's not our only concern. We are
also into pollution control
equipment, fibers, cranes, material
handling systems, power trans-
mission equipment and much more.

Is this the kind
of engineering for you?
Trying to figure out the exact
kind of engineering work you
should go into can be pretty
tough.
One minute you're studying
a general area like mechanical
or electrical engineering. The
next you're faced with a maze of
job functions you don't fully un-
derstand. And that often are
called different names by differ-
ent companies.
General Electric employs
quite a few engineers. So we
thought a series of ads explain-
ing the work they do might come
in handy. After all, it's better to
understand the various job func-
tions before a job interview than
waste your interview time try-
ing to learn about them.
Basically, engineering at GE
(and many other companies) can
be divided into three areas.
Developing and designing prod-
ucts and systems. Manufac-
turing products. Selling and
servicing products.
This ad outlines the types of
work found in the Development
and Design area at GE. Other
ads in this series will cover the
two remaining areas.
We also have a handy guide
that explains all three areas. For
a free copy, just write: General
Electric, Educational Communi-
cations, W1D, Fairfield, CT
06431.
Basic/Applied
Research Engineering
Motivated by a curiosity about nature, the
basic research engineer works toward uncov-
ering new knowledge and understanding of
physical phenomena (like the behavior of
magnetic materials). From this data base,
the applied research engineer takes basic
principles and applies them to a particular
need or problem (such as in-
creasing the energy available
from a permanent magnet).
Output is aimed at a market-
able item. Both work in
laboratories and advanced
degrees are usually required.
Advance Product
Engineering
Advance engineers bridge the gap between
science and application. Their job is to
understand the latest advances in materials,
processes, etc., in a product area, then use
this knowledge to think up ideas for new or
improved products or to solve technical prob-
lems. They must also prove the technical
feasibility of their ideas through laboratory
testing and models. Requires a highly cre-
ative, analytical mind. A pioneering spirit.
And a high level of technical expertise. Out-
put is often a functional model.
Product Design Engineering
Design engineers at GE pick up where the
advance engineer leaves off. They take the
product idea and transform it into a product
design that meets given specs and can be
manufactured. Usually, they are responsible
for taking their designs through initial pro-
duction to prove they can be manufactured
within cost. Requires a generalist who can
work with many experts, then put all the
pieces together to make a product. From
"power plants to toasters.Output is schemat-
ics, drawings, performance and materials
specs, test instructions and results, etc.
Product Production
Engineering
Production engineers in-
terface between the
design engineer and
manufacturing people.
They interpret the product
design intent to
manufacturing. They
maintain production
scheduling by trouble-
shooting during manu-
facturing and determining deviations from
specs. When necessary, they help design
adaptations of the product design to im-
prove quality or lower cost without changing
the essential product features. Requires inti-
mate familiarity with production facilities.
Engineering Management
For people interested in both engineering
work and management. Engineering man-
agers plan and coordinate the work of other
engineers. They might oversee product devel-
opment, design, production, testing or other
functions in marketing and manufacturing.
Requires a strong technical base gained
through successful engineering work. Sensi-
tivity to business factors such as cost and ef-
ficiency. Plus the ability to work with people.

for dinner tonight
Tonight, the world will have
213,000 more mouths to feed than
it had last night.
Unfortunately, we're not
growing food as fast as people.
But there's still hope of revers-
ing the trend.
Modern technology is increas-
ing the production of staple food
crops in many countries.
This "green revolution" is
something Union Carbide is very
much a part of.
We make insecticides that not
only save food crops from bugs,
but destroy themselves afterwards.
Another of our products
protects high-moisture feed grains
against spoilage from molds. So
more of the crop ends up as meat.
We've also developed better
ways to store, transport and
package food.
And we're working on other
new ideas: A seed tape that's
already helping farmers
grow more food per acre of land.
An amazing gel that helps
plants grow faster with less water.
And a sea farm where we're
raising salmon by the thousands.
Helping the world grow more
food is not the only thing we do.
But it's one of the most important.
Because those 213,000 guests
are coming—whether we're ready
or not.

This month, the Technic considers
the problems and possibilities of
solar power, as the second install-
ment in our series of energy-
related articles. With the sun daily
supplying us with more energy
than we literally know how to
use, it is natural that research be
channeled into the conversion of
solar power into other, more prac-
tical forms of energy.

Writers
New to the Technic staff this issue is Steve Haynack,
who defected from across the office wall in DATUM-land.
It seems that Steve left DATUM because of its confusing
color schemes, and has found security in the constant
black and white of the Technic - but we might surprise him
later this year.
Our Associate Editor, Thorn Lahiff, was last seen hiding
under the rug after his dispute with Editor Jim Epperson.
It seems that the night that Thorn was supposed to be
finishing his article on solar power, he actually was racing
with the Society of Automotive Engineers at Grand Prix of
America. Although Thorn and the S.A.E. did return with a
trophy. Thorn was in no shape to write his article. Working
into the wee hours of the morning. Thorn did manage to
scrape together the facts, but unfortunately, not the
spellings. When he read the article the next day, Jim
raised the ghost of Noah Webster, and a 25 kg. dictionary
before cursing, "If only we could let Lahiff write it in
FORTRAN my troubles would be over!!!!"
Mary Goodreau checked into the new Program in
Engineering for Public Systems here at Michigan, and came
up with her very informative article in this issue. PEPS, as
the new program is known, gives graduate students with a
hard science background a chance to apply their knowledge
to public-sector problems, and even to politics.
The Technic has a guest article this month, by Jim
Gallagher of the Detroit Free Press. Originally run in the
Oct. 28 issue of the Free Press, his very interesting article
on the mysterious Bermuda Triangle is reprinted here, with
permission.
As usual, Mutad Cinhcet has come up with a set of great
quotes, despite all the trouble he's had lately. Apparently,
Mutad's kid brother, Nagihcim, is some practical joker.
Nagi put Mutad's name on a list of Tau Beta Pi people
looking for rides up to the TBP convention in Flint, which
would have been nice, but Mutad's GPA is only 2.5.
Needless to say, both Mutad and TBP were a little miffed,
especially when TBP tried to find Mutad in their files. "He's
just trying to rub in the 3.95 he got in high school," said
Mutad of Nagi. "But he will soon find out Michigan isn't
Falaqar High." Tau Beta Pi's comment was not for print.

If all goes according to plan, the entire College of En-
gineering will soon be out on North Campus, possibly even
before the present freshman class graduates. And while the
administration may be literally living for that event, we
think that not a few people may regret leaving East
University behind.
Oh, yes, we agree that the facilities are needed: new
labs, better labs, larger classrooms, etc., etc., so on and so
forth, ad infinitum. There are fifteen thousand reasons why
we should go out to North Campus, all of them good ones.
The Technic does not oppose the move at all, although we
have been known to criticize the lightening pace at which
things have proceeded (recently, a 1958 Technic was loca-
ted which predicted the completion of the move by 1970).
Still, we do wonder what exactly will happen to our old
haunts. East and West Engineering. Building costs being
what they are, the University will have to keep using them,
but for what? LS&amp;A classes? My gosh, Mortimer Cooley
would spin in his grave!!! That the sacred walls of "West
Engin" should resound with the noise of Philosophy lec-
tures! What will they do with the Naval Architecture test
tank (they can't drain it - West Engin would collapse!)?
And most personally insulting, some starry-eyed History
professor will undoubtedly end up in this office-at this
desk!! Yes, much will be left behind when the College goes
north. Demonstrators will have to take the buses to reach
the Placement Office to protest the defense contractors
that are on campus. The V-Bell will no longer be available
for that "between classes refresher."
But all these depredations could be tolerated, were it not
for the one truly inseperable part of the College that will
probably be separated by the move: the Arch. It needs
no other introduction. The Arch is as much a part of an
engineering education at Michigan as is calculus and MTS,
it has been the symbol of the College since 1903. For over
71 years it has literally held up the College of Engineering,
and now we are tossing it aside, or soon will be. Of what
meaning will the Arch, with all its brass plates and insignia,
be to an English major?
Thev Technic realizes that it would be no small problem
to take the Arch with us to North Campus - as a matter of
fact, it would be quite a large problem, nigh on impossible;
but it seems so sacreligious to let it fall in to the hands of
"those people" from Angell Hall. Can't something be done?
With X millions of dollars being raised to support the move
to North Campus, can't some be spared to keep this pre-
cious piece of our academic heritage?

A BRIGHT FUTURE
The solar powered home being studied in Columbus by Ohio State
and the Homewood Corporation.
by Thorn Lah iff
SECOND IN A SERIES
As the world's reserves of fossil fuels diminish, it will be
increasingly important to develop alternative energy sources
One of these sources will not be new at all, but perhaps the
oldest source of terrestrial energy, the Sun. For it was the
energy from the Sun that created the fossil fuels, which are
no more than giant solar batteries. However, man's use of
these batteries has restricted him to the limited energy that
was stored in them. As man furthers his development of
direct conversion of solar power to useable energy, he will
realize the limitless quanta of energy at his disposal. Solar
energy is transmitted to us through space in the form of
light, which we can convert to useable energy in one of
three ways: heliochemically, helioelectrically andheliother-
mally.
Heliochemical conversion is the most familiar process,
for this is the process of photosynthesis. All life on earth is
in some way dependant on this minor miracle, in which sun-
light plays the key role. From this process, vegetation stores
the energy of the sun. It is this energy that is released when
fossil fuels (which are nothing more than super-decayed
vegetation, about a million years old) are burned. However,
the increasing demands of the world can no longer be met
6


ture, man will strive to convert solar energy by the more
direct methods of helioelectrical and heliothermal conver-
sion.
Helioelectrical conversion has received much attention
over the past few years from its role in powering many of
our space vehicles. Actually the process itself is an out-
growth of the development of semiconductors in elec-
tronics. Light striking a specially prepared surface (usually
silicon, cadmium sulfide, or gallium arsenide) excites
electrons, thus inducing a current. However, terrestrial
realization of helioelectrical conversion suffers from severe
METALLIC

PLATE
drawbacks. Even with 100% efficiency, you would need
about nine square feet of solar panel to generate one
kilowatt. But since at the present time 10% efficiency is
much more realistic, ninety square feet of solar panel are
required to generate one kilowatt. Also, we must take into
account that these figures of maximum efficiency represent
ideal conditions, where the incident sunlight is at right
angles to the panels, thus requiring servomechanisms to
track the sun. On a satelite this might be practical, but back
on terra firma, it would be costly.
Heliothermal conversion (the changing of light to heat)
is the most promising method of solar power. For centuries
man relied on the sun to heat his environment and recently
man has studied and improved upon this process. Applying
scientific methods man has increased the yield and develop-
ed new methods to store this energy for longer periods of
time.
The most common use of heliothermal energy in many
parts of the world is in home heating and cooling. In
places such as Japan, Australia, Israel, and North Africa
solar home heating equipment is common and available off
the store shelves ... It is estimated that there are over one
million operating solar heated homes in existence. The solar
powered home is fueled by a liquid that is circulated
through a series of solar collector panels into either storage
tanks or one of several heat exchangers. At the heat ex-
changers, the fluid may heat air which in turn heats the
home or perhaps even cools the house through a more
intricate heat exchange system. After the fluid has left the
heat exchanger, it returns to another storage tank to
eventually be recycled through the system again.
Solar heated homes have been uncommon in the United
States, but they are now being introduced in several loca-
tions. Studies by the University of Michigan, Ohio State,
and Westinghouse, among others, have shown that solar
powered homes are not only a reality but can be quite
economical. Westinghouse has installed the hardware to
heat and cool a five hundred student school building using
solar power. The University of Michigan has built a home
capable of self-sufficiency through ten overcast days. Ohio
State and the Homewood Corporation have built a solar-
powered home in Columbus that is the prototype for the
homes that the Homewood Corporation plans to make
commercially available in two years.
The solar home utilizes some novel designs and tech-
niques to maximize efficiency and economy. The first
noticeable difference from conventional architecture is in
the reduction of window space, which is a major source of
heat loss. To cut down in window space while still maximi-
zing living comfort, several designs are used that minimize
windows on the exterior, but stress them opening into en-
closed courtyards. These courtyards, as well as other rooms
A typical solar panel is shown above, the metallic collector plate
is a non reflective dark black to absorb the maximum solar energy
possible. The plate is made with small tubes throughout it so the
liquid can carry off the absorbed thermal energy. The liquid often is
water but more sophisticated units use liquids with better thermal
properties. The side of the reflector facing the sun is covered with
two sheets of glass to allow solar radiation to enter, but not to let
longer-wavelength reflected radiation to escape, maximizing the
possible thermal gain using the principles of the greenhouse effect.


Courtyards allow for novel new designs and also save energy.
in the home, might feature skylights made from specially
insulated bronze glass. These skylights not only were chosen
for their low heat loss characteristics, but for their ability to
cut lighting costs as well as enhance the living environment.
The selective use of glass and window area cannot be over
stressed. In the past, glass was used as an aesthetic feature
ignoring its consequences in heating economy. Proper
evaluation of actual window needs along with environmen-
tal factors can produce a house that is not only aesthetically
pleasing, but one that saves money too. Placing windows to
maximize lighting and heating benefits from the sun will be-
come a standard design concern in the future.
The solar home will of course cost more than conven-
tional housing to construct initially; this can only be ex-
pected. However studies prove that solar homes can be
built for only 10% more than conventional homes. Since
owners can look to a major (75%) reduction in fuel costs,
the initial investment would certainly be offset.
Aside from nuclear and geothermal energy, the Sun
provides us with most of our energy requirements in one
form or another . . Unfortunately nature has robbed us of
much of the sun's potential energy. It is part of the
challenge that faces us to improve the ways that we can
convert the Sun's energy more efficiently. A start has
already begun in the heliothermal heating of homes and
buildings, but this is only the beginning. The effort cannot
be allowed to die.

Prof. James Duderstadt
by Steve Haynack
Quick now, what school is rated number one in Nuclear
Engineering? If your first two guesses were M.I.T. and Cal
Tech, you're wrong. The University of Michigan's Nuclear
Engineering Department—located in the G.G. Brown Lab-
oratory on North Campus— is tops in the nation for under-
graduates in N.E. and among the top three for graduate
work along with the above mentioned M.I.T. and Cal Tech.
So claims some one who ought to know—Professor James
J. Duderstadt, tall, blond, athletic-looking star of the N.E.
Dept.'s Fission Five basketball team, holder of a B.S. degree
from Yale, and a Master's and Ph.D. from Cal Tech, and
five year veteran of the U. of M. N.E. Dept.
Such was his belief that he left behind the California
surf and sun in December 1969 to come to U. of M.
Since then he has become a part of the "strongest program
in N.E. in the country."
As in most engineering departments, the ranks of the
professors can be separated into two distinct groups—the
experimentalists and the theoriticians. Prof. Duderstadt is
of the latter type; more formally, he is an applied
theoretical physicist. He prefers experimentation on paper
to lab work musing, "If you'd put me in a lab, I'd probably
ruin it." These 'paper experiments' include working out
theories, devising new methods and systems, and predicting
results with the aid of a computer in such fields as plasma
physics, laser applications, and nuclear reactor design.
After three previous years of teaching undergrads, this
year he's teaching grad students-N.E. 441; Fission Reactors,
and N.E. 561; Nuclear Core Design and Analysis. "Sup-
posedly this will give me more time to finish my book," he
says, referring to an incomplete N.E. textbook for under-
grads. He's also been published in Nuclear Engineering
Society Journals. Prof. Duderstadt is on the Tau Beta Pi
faculty committee and he does counseling for the Engin-
eering Science Program Committee as well as for the N.E.
Dept.
Prof. Duderstadt is of the not-so-unique opinion that
students have as much to learn from each other as well as
from the instructor. To this end, he encourages students
and faculty working on projects together. Thus the stu-
dents benefit from this mutual learning exchange by obser-
ving how fellow students attack problems as well as by
observing what the professor does.
In his role as a counselor. Prof. Duderstadt is quick to
point out with pride that the undergrad enrollment in the
N.E. Dept. is growing—from 90 to 110 students this term.
He mentions that this is largely due to transfers of math,
physics, and chemistry majors from the L.S.&amp;A. College as
well as to an intelligent outlook on the job market by
undergrad engineers. With the outbreak of the energy crisis
and the goal of energy self-sufficiency for the U.S., there
will be more electricity generating nuclear power plants
built to handle the increase in power consumption. And nu-
clear engineers with B.S. degrees are being recruited to help
build them.
Prof. Duderstadt also stresses that engineering students
be well-versed in the humanities because "there is more to
engineering than technical considerations. You also have to
convince and justify your technical product to people
skeptical of even the word 'nuclear'."
While he believes that eventually the nuclear fusion pro-
cess (no radioactive waste by-products) will be the power
source of the future, he doesn't see it happening before the
year 2000. However, this will not stop Prof. Duderstadt
from 'experimenting' with it and other nuclear engineering
projects and keep him from playing basketball with the
Fission Five.

BERMUDA
TRIANGLE -
Stranger Than Truth
by Jim Gallagher
"Everything is wrong . . . strange. We can't be sure
of any direction . . . even the ocean doesn't took as
if should. , ."
14


off the southeast coast of the United States.
That's the area you fly through when you vacation in the
Carribean.
Some people, apparently, fly further than they care to.
They disappear - into thin air, it would seem.
Or into another dimension. Or the clutches of extra-
terrestial beings. Maybe even some cosmic zoo, where they
live out their lives in display cages for the enjoyment of a
more advanced civilization.
Possible Explanations
These are some of the possible explanations advanced by
Charles Berlitz for the phenomenon known as the Bermuda
Triangle, a three-sided section of the Atlantic with Ber-
muda, Miami and Puerto Rico at its apexes, in which
mysterious disappearances have been occuring for years.
The most famous incident involved a flight of five Navy
TBM Avengers, with a combined crew of nine men, which
disappeared simultaneously while on a routine training
mission in the area. The aviators apparently lost their
bearings rather suddenly and for no apparent reasons.
"Everything is wrong . . . strange," the flight leader
radioed his ground control. "We can't be sure of any
direction . . . even the ocean doesn't look as it should ..."
As if it weren't mysterious enough, a twin engine
aircraft with a crew of 13 sent to rescue the nine Avenger
flyers soon vanished as well. No wreckage was ever found,
not even an oil slick.
A Naval Board of Inquiry studying the disappearances
came up with no logical explanation. "We don't know what
the hell is going on out there," one member said. "They
vanished as completely as if they had flown to Mars,"
another one said.
Berlitz is pretty sure they didn't fly to Mars, and he ad-
mits he, too doesn't know for certain "what the hell is
going on out there." But he isn't afraid to speculate.
Back to Ancients
For Berlitz, whose book "The Bermuda Triangle" is
fast becoming a runaway best seller and who was in Detroit
to address the Michigan Metaphysical Society and plug his
book on local radio and TV, the mystery of the Bermuda
Triangle does deeper than the sandy bottom of the blue
Carribean.
It reaches back in time to ancient civilizations destroyed
by cataclism, and out into space to other galaxies where in-
telligent life may exist.
It even involves a possible universe existing contiguous
to ours • in the space between our atoms - another dimen-
sion into which we might slip and never return. The Ber-
muda Triangle, he suggests, may be a roadway into this
mysterious dimension.
"In my opinion," Berlitz said, "we are not yet advanced
enough scientifically to understand what is happening, but
we are making technological advances at such a rate that I
think we will know the answer in the near future."
What we know now, Berlitz said, is the fact that ships
and planes are disappearing in the area (also known as the
Devil's Triangle) at an alarming rate. One boat a week and
two planes a month is his estimate, a figure that a Federal
Aviation Agency spokesman in Atlanta thought much too
high, but which a Coast Guard spokesman in Miami said
was "not out of bounds."
Greenish-White Clouds
"I get letters every day from people telling me about
their experiences in the triangle," he said. Many, he said,
have experienced strange happenings in the area but have
not been lost: Compasses cease working, electrical systems
are drained, planes glow with an eerie phosphorescence,
greenish-white clouds appear out of nowhere.
From studying the radio communications of those who
have not survived, Berlitz said he has determined that the
appearance of the cloud occurs almost always. He believes
it may be an electromagnetic haze, which would explain
the mechanical failures. He argues further that such a haze
might very well transform matter into an invisible state.
For almost three decades, he said, there have been
reports that the U.S. Navy successfully conducted an ex-
periment with magnetically induced disappearances in the
Philadelphia naval shipyard. A ship and its crew, he said,
was reported to have been made invisible, and then
visible again.
7
He claimed an honorary close collaborator of his, J.
Manson Vallentine, curator of the Museum of Science of
Miami, has spoken to some of those involved, although he
admits he has never met any of them. According to
Vallentine, Berlitz said, some of the men died during the
experiment and others became emotionally disturbed.
Some, he said, continued to disappear and appear again
from time to time over the years.
The Navy has never verified that such an experiment
took place.
A Power Beneath the Sea
If magnetism is involved, Berlitz said, it may emanate
from a power source beneath the sea. In a previous book he
suggested that the lost civilization of Atlantis is located be-
neath the Carribean, where recent discoveries have inclu-
ded structures that appear to be manmade.
Perhaps, he suggested, there may be a power source in
the area so powerful as to still be operative, or which
might flare up every now and then.
Or, he continued there may even be a civilization
flourishing beneath the sea ... one that suddenly has
become alarmed by man's pollution of their previously re-
mote and protected environment.
15


that most sightings of unidentified flying objects and un-
identified submarine objects - strange vehicles beneath
the surface - have occured in the triangle area.
Even Columbus, he said, reported seeing a "flaming
shield" hurl past his ship and continue down into the water.
Of all these disappearances in the triangle, perhaps the
most intriguing involve those in which entire crews have
vanished, while their ships were left to float adrift. It is
these occurrences that have given rise to the cosmic zoo
theories, which propose that alien creatures are collecting
humans for study in some other universe.
"If this compass variation is not accounted for, you can
be put off your course by as much as 100 miles. You can
be going out to sea and think your going back to shore."
He attributed most of the disappearances to poor sea-
manship or poor airmanship.
In the face of much official pooh-poohing, which he
refers to a "cosmic Watergate," Berlitz persists.
"When we learn more about the Bermuda Triangle," he
said, "We will learn more about man's past. There are in-
dications that past civilizations destroyed themselves in
some sort of nuclear conflagration. Isn't that what we're
doing again?"
7
Even Columbus reported seeing a
"flaming shield"
hurl past his ship and continue down
into the water.
7
Not Serious to Coast Guard
What makes these theories more palatable, Berlitz said,
is the fact that animals are always left behind, except for
talking parrots - as it the alien creatures used speech as the
mark of a human being.
Spokesman for the FAA and the Miami Coast Guard
unit refuse to take the talk of a mysterious Bermuda Trian-
gle seriously.
Both pointed out that the area includes more than
200,000 square miles, most of it water. Considering the
great flow of air and sea traffic through the area, they said,
the disappearances that do occur are not really unusual.
The Coast Guard spokesman added that planes or ships
which sink in that area of the Atlantic would probably be
sucked into deep currents and pulled north along the
bottom of the ocean by the Gulf Stream, which he des-
cribed as being "just like a river".
Much of the free-floating debris in the North Atlantic,
he suggested, may be wreckage of disasters in the Bermuda
Triangle.
Other vehicles, he said, probably disappear in the sandy
ocean bottom.
"The Bermuda Triangle," he said, "is one of the two
areas in the world where compass needles point true north,
not magnetic north (the North Pole) as they do every-
where else.

Water With Jelly...
to keep people talking. Bell Labs chemical
physicist Stan Kaufman invented a material that
turns waterlogged underground phone cable
into a water-free "jelly roll" that can carry calls
again. Pumped through football-field lengths
of cable as a liquid, the material forces water out
and then turns to jelly—to keep the water out.
Water sometimes seeps into cable damaged by
plows, lightning, gophers, or sharp rocks. Phone
calls going through the cable become noisy or
don't go through at all. Until now telephone
companies had to abandon waterlogged cable,
or dig it up and replace it, or use acetone to
flush out the water. Once the acetone was
evaporated, however, there was
nothing to prevent water from
getting back in again.
We needed an inexpensive
water-repellent liquid that
would turn into a jelly inside
a cable and plug up holes.
The material also had to be
electrically nonconduc-
tive so it wouldn't
interfere with tele-
phone signals.
Such a material
didn't exist, so we asked Stan Kaufman, a 1970
Ph.D. from Brown University, to tackle the problem.
Drawing on his knowledge of molecular structure and
working with telephone company engineers—some-
times in muddy cable trenches—Stan came up with a
new compound. A Western Electric engineer modified
a pump to force the compound through long lengths of
cable. And during field trials, operating telephone
engineers suggested installation procedures.
Bell Telephone companies are happy because they
don't have to dig up as much waterlogged cable,
which often runs under highways and people's lawns,
and because restoring an otherwise good cable helps
hold down the cost of providing telephone service.

From Science: Service


for
Engineers
by Mary Goodreau
There is a need for a new type of engineer - a public
sector systems analyst who can tackle the problems in-
volved in analyzing and influencing social systems, particu-
larly in the public sector. Most engineers do not have a
sound knowledge of the economic and political side of
industry or government: while men in the public sector do
not understand modern technology. A liason is needed be-
tween the engineer and the public: this is the responsibility
of the public systems analyst. Specifically, the public sector
systems analyst has analytical capabilities coupled with a
sound understanding of the systems under consideration,
so that policy alternatives may be identified, goals clearly
defined, and the relation between the two explicitly and
effectively communicated. There is a need for programs
such as the Program in Engineering for Public Systems
(PEPS) at the University of Michigan, to train young
graduates in public systems analysis-.
PEPS is designed to educate students with undergraduate
education in an "observational" science (physics, engineer-
ing, chemistry) in the subject matter of political and social
processes and values, public sector economics, and the
structure of public systems. The PEPS curriculum has as a
primary goal the public good: engineers, systems analysts,
or scientists who are aware of technology and capable of
providing solutions of societal problems. The program is
capable of producing two different types of analysis:
1) the engineer in public systems who works as a conven-
tional engineer, but is capable of understanding their re-
lationship with public policy; 2) the engineer of public
systems who works in government, foundations, private
agencies or corporations on problem identification, plus
design, analysis and implementation of solutions to these
public policy oriented problems.
THE CURRICULUM
PEPS is open to people with a degree in the "observa-
tional" sciences and will lead to a degree of Master of
Science (Public Systems Engineering) in the Engineering
College. The program takes three semesters and requires
36 credit hours plus a summer internship for graduation.
There are seven required courses which accumulate 21
credit hours and 15 credit hours of electives which normally
comes to five courses. The required courses consist of two
courses in economics, three in political science and two
engineering courses.
The economics courses cover such topics as capital
theory and budgeting, cost benefit analysis; program
budgeting and evaluation; strengths and weaknesses of
marketing systems; theoretical and practical aspects of
government involvement in economic activity; and pro-
blems of the general level of economic activity.
One of the political science courses is a sequence of poli-
cy analysis problems and exercises, while another deals with
analytic approaches to the formation of public policy and
the role of bureaucracy therein. The third course covers the
dynamic properties of large organizations as purposeful
decision-making entities.
The two required engineering courses are from the
Industrial and Operations Engineering Department and
the Engineering Department. The I.&amp;O.E. course is con-
cerned with the methodology of mathematical models and
its applications to various problems. The Engineering course
covers case studies in the use of engineering methodology
in the public sector.
Depending on the student's goals, he can select his
electives from engineering, economics or political science.
18


knowledge of the public sector, his electives would pro-
bably be engineering courses. If he decides he would like to
work in the public sector with engineering information, he
is most likely to take either political science or economics,
depending on whether or not he wishes to work for the
government or for the private companies.
During the summer, students are placed in internship
positions so that they can gain valuable experience from
working on actual problems. So far, students have done
internships with federal agencies such as the Federal Power
Commission and the Environmental Protection Agency, and
private companies such as General Motors, Decisions and
Designs, Inc., and Vector Research, Inc.

THE HISTORY
PEPS was proposed to the Engineering College as a
modified form of IPPS for people who had a background
in science and problem solving. These students needed to
obtain a basic working knowledge of economics and
political science. Within the Engineering College itself,
there was interest in a program which would help the engin-
eering students make the transition from basic engineering
skills to employment (working with or for the public).
The evidence that some engineers, because of their inter-
action with the public, needed a program such as PEPS
came from the involvement of the faculty in politics, both
as elected and administrative members of local, state, and
federal governments.
PEPS also received much support from other areas.
Other parts of the University community supported the
program because it would create Mason between technolo-
gical and political worlds. Support was also given by the
non-University community because of the increasing role of
technology; there was and is a shortage of people who
understand both technology and public policy.
The Engineering College applied to the Alfred P. Sloan
Foundation for funding of PEPS. A grant was obtained
which provided for teaching activities, including the initial
set-up of classes and teacher workshops, internships, re-
search groups, lecture series, recruiting and visiting faculty.
Professor Stephen Pollock of the Industrial and Opera-
tions Engineering Department, who was one of the foun-
ders of the program, was named director. The first class
started in September of 1973; it consisted of five students:
two from foreign countries, and three from the United
States. The second class, which started this fall, has nine
students from varying backgrounds. Along with the new
group of students, the program also received a new direc-
tor. Professor Weston Vivian.
In looking to the future, the program hopes to double
in size by next fall and would like to get as wide a cross-
section as possible. People are needed who wish to work
with and between the engineers and public administration.
There is a demand for people in these fields; they are
helping both the technological society and the public
sector with this work. It is time that such programs were
developed, and hopefully such programs will be able to ex-
pand.
Because PEPS is in conjunction with the Institute of Pu-
blic Policy Studies (IPPS) of the University of Michigan,
different levels of the courses are possible. Some sections
start with the very basics for those students with little or no
background in the subject, while other sections will assume
some knowledge of the subject and move much faster,
allowing the student to set his own pace.

Engineering top management is just one of
many reasons why B&amp;W is the company for engineers.
At Babcock &amp; Wilcox, there are unusual
opportunities for graduating engineers to work
with people committed to technical leadership.
You can quickly get involved in areas where B&amp;W
is making a real impact.
For instance, we're a major manufacturer of
nuclear and fossil-fuel steam systems, the
world's largest supplier of specialty tubular prod-
ucts and ceramic fibers. And we're becoming a
significant force in computers and control sys-
tems, machine tools, coal gasification and
industrial automation.
With over $1 billion in shipments a year and
a backlog of $3 billion plus, you won't spend
much time in training programs. We need crea-
tive engineering types who can meet the most
demanding standards, take responsibility. And
we offer rewards to match. Don't take our word
for it. Just look at how some of our engineers
have done.

In the tall of 1882, Chester A. Arthur was President of
the United States, Custer had been dead for six years, the
telephone was a new-fangled instrument, some Eastern
schoolboys had started playing a new game with a funny
shaped oblong ball, and the University of Michigan Engin-
eering Society was founded.
Last month in this space, we traced through the early
years of the Technic, from its origins as a series of papers
presented before the fledgling Engineering Society, to its
present form of student magazine. In this issue, we look at
the content of those early Technics, as well as the Society
which started it all.
The Engineering Society was founded for the purpose of
attaining "a more practical knowledge of matters relating to
our profession." The announcement went on to say that
papers from professors and alumni were welcome, and even
invited, with the hope that these could be collected and
published every so often. From that request eventually grew
the Technic.
The first set of published papers appeared in June,
1883, and included papers on: "The Preservation of Wood,"
"The Sun's Distance," "Notes on the inspection of Metallic
Structures," and "The Care and Management of Steam
Boilers" (This last paper was presented by one Mortimer
E. Cooley, U.S.N., Professor of Mechanical Engineering -
and later. Dean of the College of Engineering
which, incidently, did not exist in 1883.). Later articles
presented designs for an electrical mining hoist and a new
and exciting means of locomotion - the electric railway.
As the Society developed, so did its publication. In 1888
it shifted from publishing only technical articles to a more
rounded format, and the name Technic was first used. In
the 1889 Technic (it was an annual in those days), a short
article outlining the courses of study available to the
aspiring young Michigan engineer appeared. These were:
drawing, surveying, strength and resistence of materials,
hydraulics, machinery, machine construction and design,
thermodynamics (we wonder if they used Sonntag and Van
Wylen?), steam engineering, marine engineering and navad
architecture, mining and metalurgy, and electricity ("Op-
portunities are also afforded for original investi§ation of
electrical phenomena"). Somewhat different from today's
offerings, but some students could be found who would
swear that it was the same old .. . uh, stuff.
One interesting and still timely comment appears in the
opening statement of the founding of the Society: "Not
only should the graduates of one university be bound
together, but the whole engineering profession should be
united as one organization." The idea may be over ninety
years old, but it still bears hearing.
The early Technics do not speak much of the student
life in the Department of Engineering, as they are generally
taken up with technical articles; but the flavor of the
times, with its emphasis on shop-oriented engineering does
come through. The Michigan engineer of the late 19th
century learned less theory, less math, but spent much
more time working with his hands than today's students -
a style of study that many might like to return to today.
For a look at the student life style in the early days, one
must jump ahead to the early Twentieth Century, and next
month's Technic.

This month the Technic's rookie staff member is Ray
Barry, a sophomore E.E., who has signed on as our new
Layout Editor and Assistant Business Manager for this
year. In addition, we talked him into doing an article on
ECE's very popular Prof. Farris as this month's Teacher
Feature all of which qualifies him for the Technic Type-
writer Award for this month, given to the staff member
who best exemplifies the great Technic spirit of "Classes?
What are those?"
Another of our new faces, "wonder boy" Doug Johnson,
turns in yet another article, this time on infra-red sensing
technology, which has taken a lot of flak from the anti-war
groups for its use in Vietnam. As Doug's article says, there
is more to it than that.
Also in this issue is our story on the change-over from
the IBM 360/67 computer to the new IBM 370/168.
Veteran users of the old machine may want to shed a tear
for the old timer's passing on, as it heads for that great
Computer Center in the sky, where overloads never happen
and freshmen don't exist. Mary Goodreau and Ellen Katz
collaborated on the article.
Editor-in-Chief Jim Epperson takes a second look at the
ideas behind hydrogen as a new energy source. Jim's first
article on the subject appeared in last April's Technic,
where he discussed the possibilities of hydrogen's use as an
auto fuel. This time, he takes a more comprehensive look
at the hydrogen energy situation, including production,
transmission and storage, as well as utilization. Some people
feel that hydrogen could be the dream fuel of the future,
others think not. The truth, as usual, lies somewhere be-
tween those two extremes, and the covers of this magazine.
Mutad Cinhcet does his usual bang-up job on the quotes
column, too. Speaking of bang-ups, Mutad nearly came to
blows with Michigan Daily Sports Editor Marc Feldman
when the two collided in our recent football game with the
Daily Libels. Fortunately, Mutad did not include Feldman's
comments on the incident in this month's column.
And finally, the Technic staff would like to say good-bye
to a good friend in this issue. Reg Lewicki, who has spent
much of his time and grade-point on our sister publication
DATUM, is graduating this December. Reg is a good man,
one of the last of the old crew that once populated this
office, and one of the finest coffee makers in the College.
We wish him well.

This month the Technic interviews one of the most
active student politicians in the College, Mr. Matt Fuze, to
get the inside dope on the recent all-campus election.
TECHNIC: Mr. Fuze, the recent Student Government
Council (SGC) elections have stirred up much controversy
about student politics and government. Do you have any
comment?
FUZE: Well, despite the efforts of my opponent to
viciously smear my name, I feel that the election was by
far the cleanest in SGC's history.
TECHNIC: Could you elaborate?
FUZE: My opponent distributed a leaflet during the
election which completely misrepresented his opinions as
I know them - totally contradictory to the facts as I
had published them two days before.
TECHNIC: Your campaign literature was completely
truthful, was it not?
FUZE: Of course. I'll stand by it to the end. But, if you
want to be picky and get into semantics, I suppose you
might find fault with some things - but then I'm a lousy
typist anyway.
TECHNIC: I see.
FUZE: And just let me say this: I didn't want to run this
time. I had had the job for a full term and was sick of it.
But when I found out that people like my opponent would
be running for my office, I decided to make the sacrifice,
rather than let political hacks like him get into power.
TECHNIC: What about the charges that you tried to
smear your opponent with guilt by association?
FUZE: If a man is guilty, he is guilty, and the electorate
should be made aware of it. It doesn't matter it it is by
association or what. I don't like these points of law, they
are too nit-picky and they confuse the issues anyway.
TECHNIC: Yes. Well, sir, we have spent a lot of time on
the particulars of your campaign and the controversy
surrounding it. Do you have any statement concerning the
election that you would like to make?
FUZE: Well, OK. My opponent was a seasoned political
hack, so I had to run a tough campaing in order to win. If I
accidently stepped over the line on a few minor occasions,
it was probably due to overzealousness on the part of my
aides. I ask you to remember the cause for which I was
running, that it was our duty to make up the electorate's
mind for its own good. Despite my opponent's claims to
the contrary, let me make one thing perfectly clear: I am
not a crook.
TECHNIC: Thank you, sir.

THIRD IN A SERIES
by Jim Epperson
With the onset of the energy crisis, we have seen an
increased interest in new non-petroleum based fuels. Some of
this activity has been channeled into relatively well known
areas: solar power and nuclear energy, for example. But both
of these systems, while reasonably well-developed and practi-
cal, have their drawbacks. Nuclear energy plants are under
attack for safety and environmental reasons, and solar power
is still in the prototype stage. But more important, neither of
these is portable.
One of the most urgent needs in this energy short era of
ours, is for a new energy base to replace or augment petroleum
products in the transportation field. Neither nuclear nor solar
power is a viable alternative at this juncture, yet something
must be done, as skyrocketing oil prices are contributing
heavily to the disastrous shape of the economy. Any good that
must be transported, be it by train, boat, car, or plane, has had
its price inflated, as well as the price of anything dependent on
it, due to increased fuel costs used in transportation.
In the April, 1974 Technic, we reported on the develop-
ment of a system to power automobiles by hydrogen. With
only minor (and inexpensive) modifications to the carbur-
ation system. Billings Energy Research Corporation converted
a 1973 Monte Carlo to hydrogen fuel, using two different fuel
systems. Since first unveiling the car in early 1974, they have
also converted a Winnebago motor home, powering the engine
and the appliances with hydrogen. Other institutions and
companies have shown an interest in the use of hydrogen, also.
In this article, we hope to look more extensively into the
potential and problems of implementing hydrogen fuel on a
large scale. Essentially, the problems break down into three
areas: production (of hydrogen), storage, and utilization.
Although each of these areas is essentially limiting on the
others, we will discuss them each in turn.
PRODUCTION
Perhaps the one question everyone asks is, "How much will
it cost?" In the case of hydrogen fuel, this is closely linked to
the means of production.
Despite the fact that it is one of the most abundant
chemical elements, free hydrogen is virtually non-existant on
earth. This is due largely to its high level of chemical activity,
meaning that it will form a compound with just about any-
thing, anytime, given half a chance. The production problem
then becomes one of finding suitable sources of hydrogen
"ore" and developing economical means of retrieving the free
gas.
One obvious source of hydrogen is through the electrolysis
of water; as a matter of fact, most of the hydrogen produced
today is obtained through electrolysis. But for the scale of
production necessary to replace fuel oil, there are serious
doubts about the economical practicality of electrolysis, as
opposed to new methods being developed. Alternate produc-
tion techniques involve the production of hydrogen from coal
gasification, or by radiolysis of water in a nuclear reactor. The
latter method, which has been researched some by Prof.
William Kerr, of the Nuclear Engineering Dept. here at U-M,
is still in the early development stages, but Prof. Kerr thinks it
shows enough potential to warrent further study. The other
scheme, production of hydrogen from coal, has been a little
more developed. Billings Energy Research used hydrogen pro-
duced in this manner for their two vehicle conversions. At pre-
6


are about 2.5 cents per mile, or about $1.60 per million BTU's;
corresponding gasoline costs are 3.5 cents per mile, and $1.83
Per million BTU's. It also is estimated that improved techno-
logy in the process could reduce the cost by about two-thirds.
Coal gasification obviously holds much promise as a means
of production of hydrogen. Still, we must continue to investi-
gate other possible means of producing pure hydrogen. To us,
our coal resources may seem infinitely abundant (about 500
years worth), but then, so did our oil reserves. Furthermore,
coal will be increasingly used for other purposes in the energy
short economy. It would behoove us, then, to continue re-
search in this area; other prototype methods of hydrogen
production exist, and could possibly be developed into
practical, large-scale systems.
STORAGE
The form in which the hydrogen is to be produced depends
heavily on how the fuel is to be used. Because of its low
density in terms of BTU/cubic foot in gaseous form, hydrogen
fuel systems suffer from storage vs. space problems. To store
an amount of hydrogen equal in energy potential to 20 gallons
of gasoline, would take up the entire trunk of a car, and a good
part of the back seal. Obviously, the gas must be compressed,
but here we get mto a trade-off problem: if too much energy
(regard/ess of form) is used to compress the hydrogen, then we
nave lost any of the advantage of using the hydrogen as our
e'- The usual answer is liquid hydrogen, stored in a properly
insulated cyrogenic container.
Hydrogen does not //ej«Jify until -422.9F, and it is no small
task to keep it fnat coicA. Until recently, the use of cyrogenic
(supercoW; hydrogen vvas severely limited by the lack of a
lightweight inexf=&gt;erts&lt;ve&gt; DUt durable storage tank.
However, Beech Aircraft has developed, as a result of its
extensive work with cyrogenics for NASA, a container that
appears to fit the bill. It is marketed in two sizes, the smaller
one being 40" x 15", weighs 75 Ibs. dry, and holds 18 gallons.
The larger one holds 38 gallons. Beech has installed the tank
on several cars, not only for use with hydrogen fuel, but also,
with other cryogenic fuels, such as liquid natural gas (LNG).
Significantly, the Billings vehicles use the Beech tank as part
of their liquid hydrogen fuel system.
A promising alternative to the use of cryogenic hydrogen is
the use of metal hydrides as a "solid state" fuel. Developed
initially by Brookhaven National Laboratory in the early '60's,
and since greatly refined, this system stores the hydrogen
chemically with a metal such as iron, titanium or nickel. The
chemical bonds are broken when the fuel "bed" is heated by
either the exhaust from the engine, or the coolant, which
would be circulated around the tubes containing the hydrides.
The released gas then travels along the fuel line to the engine.
Refueling is just as simple: gaseous hydrogen is fed into the
fuel tank where it combines with the metal. This system was
used as the second fuel system on the Billings Energy Research
vehicles. Present research in this area is directed primarily at
finding the "best" metal (s) to use, "best" being defined
usually in terms of how much hydrogen it bonds with, how
easily the bond is made/unmade.
Final solution of the storage problem would go a long way
towards the widespread use of hydrogen as a transportation
fuel. In fact, Roger Billings, president and founder of the
Billings Research Energy Corp., feels it is the only impediment.
While some may feel that this is a rather simplistic viewpoint
(there are other problems with hydrogen fuel), it is valid to a
certain extent. Until there is a solution to the inboard storage
To some people, the idea of hydrogen as a fuel seems
extremely dangerous. This "Hindenburg Syndrome," so
named because of the disaster upon which it is largely
based, does not have much truth to it. Hydrogen will
explode (so does gasoline - much more violently), but
properly handled, it can be safely used, as experience in the
space program shows.
In a crash, it is largely felt that hydrogen would be
safer than gasoline. The Beech cryogenic tank is virtually
unbreakable, and the hydride fuel system is much safer
than gasoline, since the hydrogen is chemically locked in the
metals. Should problems develop, and a fire began as the
result of an accident, the dangers would be less than with
conventional fuel. Hydrogen burns very quickly, and with
an almost vertical flame, thus the chance of a major fire
would be slim.
Nevertheless, precautions would have to be taken,
primarily because hydrogen is such a light gas, and is also
odorless and colorless; that combination means that special
care would have to be taken to prevent and locate leaks in
the re-fueling process. It is this that might require extra
training for the maintenance personnel, and hence would
limit early use of fuel hydrogen to the fleet vehicle concept.


being fully developed as a fuel.
UTILIZATION
Just how and by whom is this new fuel system to be used?
Well, you might have noticed that throughout this article, we
have tacitly assumed that it would be used as an automotive
fuel. The Billings people have convincingly shown that it can
be economically and practically implemented on a car. This is
not to say that there are any problems with doing it. A hydro-
gen fueled car tends to backfire so much that it refuses to
operate; when it does operate, it may produce excessive
amounts of nitric oxide. Billings has developed methods for
dealing with these problems, so the hydro-car, if you will, is
not merely a dream.
Other industries are interested in the use of hydrogen.
The aviation companies have shown some interest, prompted
by the rising costs of jet fuels, and the low weight of hydrogen.
Unfortunately, major problems do exist at this time. For one,
the hydride fuel system can't be used on an airplane-it is much
too heavy-thus leaving the designer with the problems of
handling cryogenic hydrogen. These could certainly be sur-
mounted, as the refueling process at an air terminal already
involves highly-trained personnel, thus reducing the handling
problem. The remaining problems are concerned with develop-
ing a suitable onboard storage system for the cryogenic hydro-
gen. Lockheed has, in the past, designed and tested a hydrogen
engine; NASA flew a B-57 with a hydrogen fueled engine back
in the late '50's, so the technology does exist. Lockheed's
Director of Science and Engineering, Mr. Gordon Sim, testi-
fied before a House subcommittee that, while problems still
were unsolved, the potential benefits warrented further study
and experimentation.
Railroads would stand to benefit from hydrogen use, also,
yet they have not shown much (if any) interest in its develop-
ment. Many of the problems which have been plaguing hydro-
gen use in other areas could be easily circumvented by the
railroads. The storage problem is not that important, as the
POLLUTION
One of the more desirable advantages to hydrogen
as opposed to petroleum fuels is its pollution free nature.
The natural by-products of hydrogen combustion are water,
and a very small amount of nitric oxide - well within the
EPA standards for 1975. Obviously this is a much cleaner
situation than with other presently used fuels.
If hydrogen were to be used as the standard automo-
tive fuel, not only would we have a chance to re-coup our
rapidly deteriorating environment, but we could do it
economically. The auto companies have constantly bitched
about the pollution standards that they are required to
meet, and have blamed both the increased costs of their
product and its low gas mileage on them. With a hydrogen
fuel system, none of the excess devices required for emission
control, such as a catalytic converter or PCV valve, is
necessary; hence, by their own figures, the cost of automo-
biles would (all else equal) go down when a hydrogen
system is installed. But don't hold your breath waiting
for the change • it makes too much sense to be done.
locomotive could easily haul and carry the hydrogen, be it in
hydride or liquid form. And certainly the logistics problem,
that of servicing and handling the fuel, is solvable, as railroad
service facilities are centralized enough to permit easy handling
of the hydrogen.
This problem of logistics has been mentioned with reference
to aircraft and railroad implementation, and we have asserted
that with these uses of fuel hydrogen, the problem was sur-
mountable. With personnel-use automobiles, the story is much
different. Hydrogen is in many ways safer than gasoline (see
box), but proper handling of it would require much more
training than the average gas pump jockey receives. More
importantly, though, the construction of facilities and special
equipment necessary to support a hydrogen fuel system nation-
wide would be difficult to accomplish in the space of a few
years. It is hard to imagine the quick and simple replacement
of the present gasoline transmission/service system with one
using hydrogen. The only feasible solution for the immediate
future would be large, centralized facilities with well-trained
personnel, which points directly to what may be the quickest
and most immediate implementation of hydrogen as a fuel:
fleet vehicles. Only a large number of vehicles operating out
of the same "base" could justify the original capital outlay
and trouble involved in constructing and maintaining the new
facilities. Mass transit systems, including bus and taxi compan-
ies, are particularly interesting as probable "first runs" for
hydrogen; so are trucking firms, postal services, etc.
Other new fuels are being considered and studied as re-
placements for hydrogen: methane, methanol, liquid natural
gas (LNG) and even kerosene. However, hydrogen's are many:
it is not petroleum based, is virtually non-polluting, and has
better combustion characteristics than these other fuels. If
the problems of storage and production can be solved, and if
the country can be convinced to make the changeover (this
may be the hardest part of the deal), hydrogen could well be
the transportation fuel of the future.

way in the last three decades. It started with advances in
infrared, and visible scanning technology.
Remote sensing, defined in laymen's terms is simply:

levels exist in is waves. Low energy levels will produce
wavelengths that are extremely long; high energy levels will
produce waves with wavelengths that are extremely short.
Any engineering student has seen the relation: f=cA:
where f equals frequency in Hertz (cycles per second), X
equals wavelengths in meters, and c equals the speed of
light (300,000,000 meters per second). The complete range
of frequencies and wavelengths can be thought of as a
band of frequencies and wavelengths: the electromagnetic
spectrum (fig.1).
The visible spectrum lies between 100nm and 1 micron,
and the infrared spectrum lies between 1 micron and 100
microns, both in wavelength.
The visible spectrum contains the colors humans can
sense: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and last,
but not least, violet.
The infrared spectrum is sensed as heat, but is coded on
film, or by computers as visible images. Infrared spectra
is divided into three parts: far infrared, intermediate
infrared, and near infrared.
In this article we are most concerned with the visible
and the infrared portions of the electromagnetic spectrum.
SOURCE RADIATION
When utilizing a device to scan part of the earth's
surface, it is necessary to have some source of initial
radiation. The main source for all electromagnetic radiation
is the sun. The sun supplies the source radiation for all
types of absorbed, and reflected media, such as vegetation,
or a city street. This means that the sun will deliver equal
amounts of energy to all types of media. Some media will
absorb the sun's energy, increasing its temperature, and
increasing its own energy in the infrared spectrum. Some
media will reflect the sun's energy, giving it an emission
in the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, be-
cause the sun's energy peaks in the visible spectrum (fig.2).

REMOTE SENSING
There are several examples of remote sensing which
utilize infrared, and visual sensing technology, one of the
simplest methods is single channel thermal scanning; one of
the more complicated methods is multi-channel, or multi-
spectral scanning.
Computers can be programmed to code data from visual
scanning more readily than from infrared scanning.
A good example of thermal scanning might be the
following: (fig. 3) during the day the sun heats up the
vegetation, and the geographic strata; however some media
will absorb heat in a different way than other media. An
underlying coal deposit absorbs heat differently than
ground vegetation, and this is sensed by a thermal scanner
fig. 4
mounted in a high flying aircraft. The data from the
scanner is fed into a computer which codes the various
infrared signatures to their respective sources. The above is
also an adequate example of multispectral scanning if we
take into account the reflected and absorbed waves, and
their respective emission spectra in the visible spectrum.
Output from a scanner can be interpreted directly by
trained personnel or it can be fed into a computer which
will code the signatures to their respective sources. This
means that a certain type of vegetation, etc., will reflect,
absorb, and emit spectra in a way that is distinctive to its
species only.

ERTSB
ETRS B will travel in a near polar sun synchronous orbit
at an altitude of 914 km; it will circle the earth every
103 minutes, and photograph the same area every 18 days.
It weighs 891 kg. ERTS B will photograph an area 185 km
wide and complete 14 orbits each day.

INSTRUMENTATION
Spectral scanning systems for remote sensing employ a
great deal of integrated circuitry, fiber optics, lens techno-
logy, digital computers, and aerospace technology. High
quality engineering is necessary so the user may obtain
a high degree of resolution. More resolution, of course, is
needed as the distance between the scanner and the area
being scanned increases.
As of this point in time engineers must concentrate
their efforts on processing equipment as opposed to
scanning equipment. This is because current scanner techno-
logy is years ahead of remote sensing processing technology.
Output in remote sensing comes in a variety of forms,
ranging from coded computer pictures (fig.4), to prints
developed directly from infrared and visual film (fig.5).
AEROSPACE
Remote sensing has been greatly responsible for creating
jobs for a great portion of unemployed aerospace engineers.
Because of defense cutbacks, these engineers are now
working on systems that will benefit mankind, instead
of working on weapons systems that have no practical use.
At this point the majority of remote sensing work is
done from high flying aircraft. Some remote sensing work
was done from Skylab, which was equipped with a variety
of multispectral systems.
The newest advance in remote sensing systems is the
Earth Resources Technology Satellite (ERTS). ERTS B
(fig.6) is planned for launch in January of 1975, and will
continue the remote sensing work started by its twin ERTS
A which is now faltering in its earth orbit, although it has
outlived its projected life by over a year.

Applications of remote sensing are simply too numerous
to count. The Army used infrared scanning systems in
Vietnam to help seek out the enemy-but there is more to
remote sensing than that.
*MSS and remote sensing's biggest challenge in this era
is to help find new sources of energy. Remote sensing can
do this by taking advantage of the physical properties of
coal, oil, natural gas, and radioactive elements.
* Remote sensing can be used to find and collect data
about natural resources other than energy, such as iron,
copper, tin, lead, aluminum, and other metals; also timber
and all types of crops and vegetation.
'Remote sensing can be used to survey ecological
damage such as forest fires, strip mining, air, and water
pollution.
'Remote sensing can be used to survey man made
phenomena, such as cities and roads.
'Remote sensing can help man better manage his land,
and his urban areas. It can help him develop better trans-
portation systems, and help him better manage existing
ones.
CONCLUSION
Infrared, and visual scanning systems have seen many
technological advances in the last few years. Remote sensing
can help man better understand the world he lives in, and
better use it for his gain. Remote sensing technology must
be used to benefit mankind, and his environment.

by Ray Barry
/ looked at my watch - only 30 seconds to class time -
and to make things worse, everyone comes earlier than
usual on the first day. Checking my schedule for the
right room, I quickened my pace. My footsteps echoed in
the hollow, empty halls of East Engineering as I counted
off the room numbers. Here it is I thought, reaching for the
door. I wanted to slip into the room unnoticed but the door
creaked as I cautiously pulled it open. Everyone was seated
when, about a half step into the room, a greeting, that is,
my name boomed from the front of the room. Startled, I
turned to see who it was. Why, Professor Farris! He had
actually remembered my name from last year. I wasn't
used to that - but it felt good.
"I feel it is important to both the student and the
professor," explained Prof. Farris in a special interview.
The student has a lot of money invested, college should be
an enjoyable experience. The student should not feel like
a computer card.
The student Prof. Farris claims, is more likely to come to
see a professor when he knows the professor will remember
him by name. He likes his students to feel they have some-
body to go see and to talk to ■ not just about any course
material and when they have him for a class, but anytime
about anything. And too, the little extra effort in remem-
bering names pays off just in the friends he makes, asserts
the amiable professor.
Prof. Farris confesses, though, that while he makes an
honest effort to learn his student's names he does not
a/ways learn them all, especially in large classes. Names of
some students he hasn't seen in a long time can get a
little foggy too, he admits.
A Bachelor of Science degree in math and physics, and
then a Master of Arts degree in education were earned by
Prof. Farris at Eastern Kentucky State University. This,
by the way, makes him one of the few professors to have
any formal training in education and perhaps accounts for
his effective classroom technique.
During World War II the army placed him in the Signal
Corp., where he discovered his interest in electronics and
specifically in communications. His M.S.E.E. was then
obtained from the Univeristy of lllinios in 1948. Finally,
in 1959 he completed work on his Ph.D. at the University
of Michigan while simultaneously serving as the director
of Cooley Lab.
The 22-year mark is quickly approaching in Prof. Farris's
tenure here at U of M. Six of those saw him holding the
title of Associate Dean of the College of Engineering. A
very active member of the I.E.E.E. he has held various
regional and sectional offices. Presently he is a member
of its longrange planning committee. Also active in the
National Electrical Conference, he has served as its Presi-
dent and Chairman.
In January, Prof. Farris will hit the bright lights and big
times hosting a 15 segment T.V. series that will deal with
the engineer in modern society. The series is slated for
airing over public television. Giving talks interpreting engin-
eering to laymen is one of the communications expert's
main interests - probably the ultimate communications
problem. His 120 students can verify his proficiency in this
area.
Engineering aside. Prof. Farris enjoys playing tennis.
(His goal is to beat the somewhat older Prof. Tai.)
14


that his game is not quite as good as it used to be in his
college days.
Prof. Farris talked at length during my interview about
engineering education, an area of great concern to him.
He feels there is a tendency to go the wrong way. Too
much emphasis is placed on math and science and not
enough on engineering. There should be less time spent
proving theorems and more time on physical orientation.
Part of the problem, he suggests, stems from the fact
that many professors have little or no practical experience.
They've spent their lives in educational institutions and
don't precisely know what real world engineering is like.
They've never worked in industry. As a result students
gain little from them concerning what to expect.
The prerequisite structure of the E.C.E. department is
another target of Prof. Farris. As it currently stands, E.C.E.
300 and 305 are about the only prerequisites for all other
E.C.E. courses. That is improper, he believes, because there
are courses (for example, 432) in which the teacher assumes
knowledge obtained from these two courses.
Engineering as a profession is a major goal Prof. Farris
would like to see achieved. Presently, engineering is a
technical career, claims the professor. Engineers should be
professionals, not technicians. A professional, as he defines
it, is a person who has a fair measure to say about his
destiny. A professional has a distinctive title rather than
one which refers to anyone from the operator of a train to a
garbage collector, ^^^mmm^^a^mi^^^^m^^

by Mary Goodreau and Ellen Katz
Any student who has taken a computer course can re-
member taking all of his homework along with a novel such
as War and Peace to the computer center with him. He was
usually able to finish his other homework and do some
reading before his program would execute if it was lengthy.
The problems with the turn around time and large queues
were caused by frequent break downs and the inability of
the central processing units to cope with the large influx of
programs. Hopefully these problems will be eliminated as
we say goodbye to the present IBM 360/67 and hello to the
IBM 370/168 in January.
Contrary to popular belief there should be little problem
adjusting to the new system. Since the new system is an
IBM, it is compatible with the present system. If another
system such as Honeywell or CDC was obtained, there
would be a need for vast reprogramming of the system
(virtual memory mode, instruction set, command set,
system routines and language processors) because of incom-
patibility. This reprogramming could have easily led to
errors which would cause noncorrectible errors in programs.
With the IBM 370/168 there is no need for the vast
reprogramming so that programs which are syntactically
correct should run.
There is a need for a number of changes in some of the
internal components of the IBM 370/168; there should be
little trouble with the changes since the University of
Michigan will be using the University of British Columbia's
version with necessary changes. The University of British
Columbia has been using the 370/168 version of MTS as
their principle operating system since January 1974.
University of Michigan staff members are going to test the
UBC version to discover what changes need to be made in
the system sometime in November. The changes will be
made before January so that user's programs should run
with as few problems as possible. As it stands now applica-
tions programs which are written in higher level languages
such as FORTRAN and PL/I should need no conversion.
If a program is written in assembly language, there might be
a need for conversion since there are certain instructions
which are available on the 360/67 which are not available
on the 370/168. As a Result, object modules using these
instructions will fail to execute properly.
_7T
As we say hello to the 370/168, we should also be
saying hello to faster turn around time. The speed of the
central processing unit of the 370/168 is, on the average,
six times greater than that of a single processor on the
360/67. Since the present 360/67 has two CPUs, the total
CPU capacity will be increased by a factor of three. Since
the saturation of the processors is a principle factor
governing throughput, hopefully there will be a significant
decrease in the turn around time for batch jobs and re-
sponse time for terminals. Another advantage for users who
forget to put on time limits the default time will be five
seconds instead of the present thirty seconds.
Even though new higher price rates will go into effect,
the increased speed of the new processor should lead to a
reduction in run costs. Which will mean that a user can run
the same number of runs in an evening as he does now with
a reduction in both time and cost.
The 370/168 should not be down as often as the 360/67
which will also cut down significantly on turn around time.
There are certain instruction retry capabilities and the built-
in error detection and correction functions of the storage
units on the 370/168 which are an advantage. There is a
disadvantage in the fact that the ability to isolate a failing
component and to operate the rest of the system while the
failing component is being repaired is not as good on the
370/168. As a result, the time between hardware failures
in the new component should be greater, but when a
failure does occur, the computer might be down for a
longer time.
As a whole the change over should be advantageous to
the users, since it will not interrupt their use of the system
as it will be done over break. All of the parts will be tested
before the change over is completed; most of it before the
360/67 is removed. The faster turn around time and im-
proved dependency of the IBM 370/168 should be worth
any small system problems in January. With the large
number of users the University of Michigan has needed a
new system. Hopefully the new IBM 370/168 can handle
the work load.

make light of phone calls...
by sending them through tiny glass fibers on
beams of light pulses. To this end, Bell Labs
ceramic scientist Ray Jaeger has helped design a
new system to make such fibers — using a
powerful carbon dioxide laser.
In the future, one hair-thin fiber might carry several
phone calls within big cities or as many as 4000
long-distance calls. But many
problems must still be solved. Ray
tackled one of them — the problem
of today's glass fibers, which
contain impurities that absorb and ^ i ,
weaken light beams. One impurity
source is the conventional heaters
used to melt glass rods that are
drawn into fibers.
Ray had to find a "clean" heat
source that also would be precisely
controllable, to assure uniform
diameter throughout a mile-long
fiber. Using his broad knowledge of
ceramic materials — he's a 1967
ceramic science Ph.D. from Rutgers — Ray
studied many heat sources. But he finally
explored a new approach: melt the glass rod
with a carbon dioxide laser.
To make fibers, Ray had to devise a way of
focusing the laser beam uniformly around the
rod's circumference. He solved this major
problem with a rotating lens and reflectors, to
form a doughnut of radiation around the rod.
Now Western Electric engineers are studying
variations of such a laser system to develop the
most practical manufacturing procedure.
To make optical communications useful, other
Bell Labs scientists are working on ways of
splicing glass fibers. And on better, cheaper,
longer-lasting light sources and efficient ways
of getting calls on and off light beams.
Although today's communications systems are
more than adequate, someday there will be a
need for the added versatility and capacity
of optical systems. And the Bell System
will be ready because of Ray
and others like him.

Many people we know couldn't
stomach what some college
students eat jn one day.
Luke warm coffee.
Peanut butter on crackers.
Beer.
Two chocolate bars.
And a hamburger.
But for millions even this
epicurean nightmare would be a
welcome feast. It's no secret, hunger
is one of the major problems facing
many people in the world.
And helping nations produce
more food is something FMC can
do very well.
We can engineer giant land
reclamation programs.
To increase agricultural
production we make machines that
prepare the soil and plant the seeds,
enabling large acreages to be
worked efficiently.
To protect the crop from pests
and disease we produce special
agricultural chemicals, such as
Furadanf an insecticide-nematocide
that's boosting the yields of rice,
alfalfa, corn, peanuts and
sugarcane.
We make mechanical harveste
for special crops such as tomatoes,
corn, peas and beans and--to help
make low-cost food possible, we
make automatic food canning and
freezing equipment.
We even design machines to
form and fill bags and boxes, and
manufacture many types of
transparent films for packaging.
And while we don't have the final
solution to the hunger problem, we
do offer more ways and means of
growing, harvesting, processing
and packaging food than any other
single company in the world.
Helping to feed hungry people
is one of our major concerns, but
it's not our only concern. We are
also into pollution control

handling systems, power trans-
mission equipment and much more.

"REGENTS SQUELCH R.O.T.C."
"At a recent meeting the Regents decided that the
demobilization of the S.A.T.C. should mark the end of the
Military at Michigan. The suggested re-establishment of a
unit of the Reserve Officer's Training Corps was turned
down, and we are sure that a large majority of the
students back this decision. A year of R.O.T.C. and a term
of S.A.T.C. have ably demonstrated that if the military
work is not absolutely necessary, it should be left out
entirely. There are ever continual and severe conflicts be-
tween the military and scholastic to the detriment of
both."
What's a 1969 Michigan Daily and article have to do
with the field of engineering? If you read the article a little
more closely, you'll notice a few terms you feel you should
be more familiar with, but aren't—such as "S.A.T.C"?
That's the Student Army Training Corps. Still don't re-
cognize it? Well, that's all right. Maybe it's because the
article was not dredged up from the Daily's files, but from a
Michigan Technic dated December 1918. Are you still
confused? Even more so? Do you even care?
The story behind the headlines is that we (the EDITOR)
here at the Technic are on a nostalgia kick (isn't everybody
these days?) and thought that recycling some of the
'good old days' stuff would provide an interesting sidelight,
not only into engineering, but also into a time different,
with a unique culture, yet not at all unlike the world of
today.
The following insights into the everyday life and manner-
isms of the nineteen twenties may seem a little strange to
you, but try to take them with a grain of salt, or whatever
you're into—they had hip flasks back then.
The "College Notes" and "Transitory Slants" were
filled with wonderful little items about when "Johnny
Comes Marching Home Again". When the S.A.T.C. was
formed in 1918, "the companies were quartered in many
different houses including the following fraternities: Alpha
Tau Omega, Alpha Delta Phi, ..." and so on down the
alphabet until "Zeta Beta Tau, the government paying the
fraternities a rental of seven cents per day per man
quartered there ... the S.A.T.C. men were quartered in
barracks for only a few days before an epidemic of in-
fluenza broke out . . . the men were quarantined in their
barracks for 10 days, marching to mess and back." Here's
some military humor:
NOT FRIGHTENED
Private Jones was doing his first guard duty. An officer
approached and Jones failed to salute. The officer halted
and said pompously "My man, do you know who I am?"
Jones admitted his ignorance. "I am a colonel," the
officer said. Jones grinned and said, "Gee you wuz
lucky. They made me just a private."
PROMOTION
The rookie was being taken to the guard house. "Quick
promotion" he muttered to himself. "I am already in
charge of a squad of men."
Granted, those two jokes were not of the usual high
standard of quality, but that's the military, and what's so
funny about war? While it seems that the military has
changed little since then (or has it?), I've found that the
students themselves have not changed. I guarantee a lot of
good ones representative of the student life at the time:
EMPTY THOUGHTS
The school instructor was teaching a class in which
there were some pupils whose vocabularies were not
very extensive. "Now," he said, pointing to one of them,
"tell me what is a vacuum?" the pupil thought hard for
a moment, and then answered: "I have it, in my head,
sir, but I can't express it."
22


LOTS OF WORK
"Now, in case anything should go wrong with this
experiment," said the professor of chemistry, "we and
the laboratory with us will be blown sky high. Now
come a little closer, boys, in order that you may follow
me."
Prof: "Only fools are positive."
Student: "Are you sure?"
Prof: "I'm positive."
"I went to a wooden wedding last week."
"You did? How was that?"
"Two Poles got married."
A little Irishman was being examined for admission to
S.A.T.C. He seemed all right with one exception. The
doctor said, "You're a little stiff." Quickly the Irish
blood mounted as the applicant roared "And you're
a big stiff/"
We notice many fellows wearing hunting coats who

With the arrival of the new year, the Technic takes time
to do a little face-lifting. We are dropping two "regular
features" and adding a new one. Hopefully this will im-
prove the quality of our product.
The two departed features are "In Stercore Veritas Est"
and "Technic Writers." The former, whose title was Latin
for "in bullshit there is truth," was beginning to get stale,
and we had the feeling that is just wasn't being read. We
may resurrect it in some other form sometime in the fu-
ture, though.
"Technic Writers," which use to occupy this space, was
quickly becoming a cute ego-trip. It started out (back in
1973) as a vehicle to publicize our authors and staff. But
once is enough, and we were going a bit too far. The re-
placement, which you are reading now, will make mention
of any guest authors, but its main intent will be to tell you
why we are printing what we are printing, as well as to slip
in any items that don't quite fit into an article.
So much for the preamble. In this issue, we continue
our series on alternate energy sources with an article by
Dave Voss on nuclear power-both fission and fusion.
Nuclear power has been feasible for some time now-many
plants are in operation—but it recently has come under fire
for economic and ecological reasons. Still, it is a viable
energy alternative that should be utilized. By the way,
Dave is our new Associate Editor.
Our story cover is on the latest development in sound
systems—4-channel, or quadraphonic, or quadrasonic, or
whatever. One of the problems is the multitude of names
that have flooded the market recently, causing no end of
confusion for the consumer. Ray Barry's article not only
explains the differences between various 4-channel systems,
but also traces the history of 4-channel.
Perhaps the least understood group of people in the
College are the foreign students. Usually alone in an un-
familiar land, speaking an unfamiliar tongue, very few of
them develop relationships with many American students.
In an effort to bridge this understanding gap, we publish
Gerald Wong's excellent article about the foreign exper-
ience in collegiate America.
One regular feature that we've decided to keep is our
Technic Teacher Feature. The month's victim—er, subject-
is Prof. Benford of the Naval Arch. Dept., who was highly
recommended to us by some students of his. By the way,
if any of you have a prof whom you would like to see
profiled in a Teacher Feature, submit his name to us for
consideration.
We also have a short essay by Tom Spoering (ECE/AOS
75), recently initiated into Tau Beta Pi. In fact, his essay,
"Preparing for the Future," was one of the winners in the
chapter's electee essay contest. It points out several
classic examples of "experts" saying "it can't be done,"
and then watching helplessly as "it" was done. So much for
the experts.
That's it for the February Technic. Hopefully, you'll
find it better than previous issues, but in any case, we
invite your comments. Send them to me.

I don't like surprises. I turned on the shower the other
morning and stepped in only to find cold water. After let-
ting the adrenalin return to wherever it came from, I
thought about the incident and my reaction. I had always
had hot showers; I had a right to be angry. This particular
morning I didn't get hot water because the hot water heater
was overloaded and there wasn't enough to go around.
Suppose that we turned on our light switches and nothing
happened. We have all become so used to having a switch
to provide light, telephones and televisions to provide
communication, cars to provide transportation. We have all
become so used to hot showers in the morning that when
it is all gone we won't believe it.
It happens very suddenly. One day you walk past the
Graduate Library and notice all of the waste that is
supposedly necessary in building an addition. You go into
the store and buy an aluminum can filled with soda pop,
realizing the fact that the aluminum is made by a very
energy-expensive process. You go home and sit in front of
your television, watching advertisement upon advertisement
explaining the joys of owning an electric carving knife,
or an electric toothbrush. You read a book called Limits to
Growth in which the world dies ten times because of the
inefficiency that someone programmed into a computer,
and are reassured that it can't happen here. Question
Without Answer No. 497: Do we have the sense to turn
off the lights when we leave the room?
Only recently have people been thinking about effi-
ciency. Edison is a genius because he invented the incan-
descent light bulb. Ask anyone you meet if they know who
invented flourescent lighting and fifteen times out of ten
they don't. Flourescent lighting consumes two-thirds less
energy than an incandescent light of the same brightness.
The gas-turbine car was almost a reality. If it had been
developed, the present pollution standards might not be
necessary, and the high development cost of the turbine
might have been balanced out by the hundreds of dollars
worth of pollution reducing equipment that is being put
on piston engines.
The point of all of this is not that we should return to
those Romantic Days of Yore, when dinner was cooked in
the fireplace instead of in an electric oven, and even a cold
shower was a luxury. Rather, we should think a bit more
about how we use our resources. I don't mind color
television, electric can openers, or trips to the moon, but it
seems to me that an examination of priorities is in order.
Whether we go on wasting energy at enormous rates or
concentrate on making what we have go farther is up to
each of us. If we don't choose wisely we all may be sur-
prised one morning.

^&lt;rnr&gt;-B^5S
by Ray Barry
Since it's inception several years ago four channel sound
has been revolutionizing the audio scene. The engineers and
technicians have been having loads of fun, but the chaos
surrounding four channel has left the consumer befuddled.
Most of the confusion has been caused by the numerous
incompatible and constantly changing systems with which
the manufacturers have flooded the markets with no set
standards, the industry remains splintered on which direc-
tion four channel should take.
Indicative of the state of disarray is the indecision about
what to call it: quadraphony, quadrasonic, quadriphonic,
tetraphonic, tetrasonic, quadraphony, quadrusonic have all
been used. Not all, by the way, are grammatically correct.
Why Is Four Better?
First, there are two questions to be answered: Is four
channel more than just a new gimmick to soak the consu-
mer for increased profits and why? It is undeniable that
four channel has the potential to line the pockets of the
manufacturers; it is a veritable gold mine if it ever becomes
as popular as stereo. However, four channel is more than a
profit boosting scheme; it is a sound reproduction tech-
nique that out-performs conventional stereo.
Keep in mind that what we're talking about is high fidel-
ity; that is, reproducing sound with a high degree of
simularity to the original. Four channel can reproduce a
live performance more faithfully than two; therefore, high
fidelity-wise, four channel is better.
It became apparent in the 1950's that good frequency
response and low distortion were not the only requirements
for a high fidelity system. Recordings could not approach
the dimensions of a live performance no matter how good
the system was. To improve the fidelity of recordings,
stereo was introduced. With two speakers being fed two
different signals the locations of the performers on stage
could be constructed. Mono provided a point source for the
sound, but stereo provided a "wall" of sound which is
considerably more realistic. If a vocalist was at center stage
during recording, the vocalist would appear midway be-
tween the listener's speakers when played back.
As stereo was perfected it became apparent that two
channels were not capturing the fullness of a live perfor-
mance. Stereo is better than mono, but not as good as the
real thing. The audience at a concert hears not only sounds
coming directly from the instruments, but also sounds
arriving indirectly via reflection from the walls and ceiling.
These reflected sounds, known as ambience, are responsible
for the quality of a live performance and are not captured
in a conventional stereo recording.
Again, the solution was to add additional channels.
These new channels would carry the ambience information.
With two speakers in front of the listener and two behinc
him, sounds originating from anywhere in a full circle
around the listener can be reproduced. Four channel re-
cordings can make a typical living room sound acoustically
as large and alive as the original concert hall.
This is fine for music intended to be heard live, but
what about music produced in the studio with no relation
to a live environment? For this, recording engineers have
been using a "surround sound" effect, positioning the
performers in a circle around the listener. The "surround
sound" effect has resulted in a new creative medium for
recording artists.

Shown above is the method of taping four channel sound on
standard one-quarter inch open reel tape compared to the conven-
tional stereo method. Since all four tracks are used for quad,
recording is limited to one direction and playing time is halved.
Crude Beginnings
Four channel sound emerged from the laboratory in
1969 after several years of development. The Vanguard
Recording Society, a small record company noted mainly


market. Their product was discrete four channel open-reel
tapes which sold for outrageous prices. At that time tape
was the only format capable of handling four separate
signals. All four tracks of the standard one-quarter inch
tape were used, limiting recording to one direction and re-
ducing playing time by one-half (see fig. 1). Needless to
say, a limited number of machines were capable of playing
them.
The first four channel broadcasts, surprisingly enough,
took place in 1969 also. Two Boston FM stations cooper-
atively broadcast the Boston Symphony Orchestra. Each
station carried one front and one back channel. Two
stereo systems were required to receive the broadcast in
quad.
Also at this time David Hafler of Dynaco announced
the "Hafler system" of producing four channel. While it
carries his name, he is not the real inventor, several
variations having been in use in Europe for at least four
years. The "Hafler system" is a rather simple method in-
tended for recovering ambience information from stereo
recordings already contain some ambience. About half of
this ambience to reach the microphones is 90 degrees out of
phase. The "Hafler system" attempts to extract this infor-
mation and feed it to the extra speakers. If additional am-
bience were added intentionally, reasoned Hafler, the
effect could be enhanced. The best part about this method
is that it does not require decoders or extra amplifiers
(see fig. 2), but the separation of adjacent channels is only
3dB -far from ideal.
The Matrix Mix-up
The audio industry realized that in order for four
channel to become a marketable item it must be made as
convenient as possible and compatible with present stereo
and mono systems. A compatible four channel disc became
; the ultimate goal. Squeezing four channels onto a disc is no
simple problem.
Pete Scheiber developed the first of many methods of
doing just that. The Scheiber technique is known as
matrixing. Matrizing involves mixing four channels into
two with specific phase and amplitude relationships and
then reconstructing the original four channels from what
is known about how they were mixed. Encoding (reducing
four channels to two) is easy. Decoding (reconstructing the
four original signals) is like solving two equations for four
variables: impossible. Fortunately enough information can
be extracted to construct four different signals simulating
the originals.
Scheiber's original system had very poor adjacent
channel separation. To overcome this problem he devised
special logic circuitry to enhance the separation of adjacent
channels. The logic'circuits monitor all four decoded sig-
nals to determine when one of them is sufficiently greater
than the signal in the opposite channel. When such condi-
tions exist the adjacent channels are shut down, in-
creasing the directionality of the signal. The logic circuits
were useless when all channels were driven and sudden
changes in relative volumes of the channels occurred when
channel emphasis changed.
Following Scheiber, many other interested parties jump-
ed into the matrix scene with both feet. A plethera of ma-
trix systems were developed, most of which have sub-
sequently been dropped or never seriously considered.
This is where the confusion began; the consumer was given
the hopeless responsibility of choosing a matrix system.
The thing to remember about matrices is that all use the
same principle. The only things that change are the propor-
tions and phase relationships used to mix the four channels
into two. This does not make them all compatible, though.
Pete Scheiber joined forces with Electro-Voice, improved
his matrixing technique and scrapped his logic system to
create the original Electro-Voice Matrix. The assumption
used to get the matrix coefficients (proportions and phases)
is that not a great deal of frontal separation (side to side) is
necessary, but a front-center "vocalist" should not wander

Three simple methods of ambience recovery for use with con-
ventional stereo systems are demonstrated above. A. The original
Hafler system required one speaker in front for the right plus
left information, one in back for the right minus left signal, and
the normal two channels on either side. B. The early Dynaco
system shifted the speakers to the corners of the room using this
scheme. C. Adding R^ to the Dynaco system yields yet another
method. R^s resistance should be equal to the individual impedance
rating of the speakers used and have a power rating of about 10
watts. The proper polarities should be observed in all set-ups to
insure proper phasing of the speakers. One word of caution: Before
trying either A or B make sure the ground or common terminals
of the amplifier can safely be tied together.

side separation was poor, (see fig. 3).
In Japan, R. Itoh developed a "90-degree-rotation"
matrix which Sansui adopted and named "QS" (Quadra-
Phonic). The QS matrix attempts to achieve better spacial
definition than E-V with more symetrical channel separ-
ation (see fig. 4). A 90 degree phase shift is introduced in
the rear channels during encoding and decoding so that
signals intended for the rear speakers appearing in the
front are 90 degrees out of phase and signals intended for
the front appearing in the rear are also 90 degrees out of
phase. This improves the subjective front to back separa-
tion.
In the QS matrix, signals intended for the rear channels
are almost completely lost in mono reproduction. This is a
serious defect because the statistical majority still listen in
mono. This defect did not bother the Engineering Com-
mittee of the Record Association of Japan; they adopted
it as the standard matric in 1972 and dubbed it RM
(Regular Matrix).

Shown here is the comparison of the original Electro-Voice
matrix coefficients and discrete figures. The numbers refer to
deciBells of seperation between the channels shown and the
corresponding channels of the figure. Only the left side is shown,
the right side is just a mirror image. The arrows indicate the phase
relationships; arrows pointing up are in phase with the original
discrete material.
Meanwhile Columbia Records was developing their own
matrix. They desired compatibility with mono and stereo
and good side to side separation. Compatibility was
achieved by stipulating that signals intended for rear
center reproduction could not be recorded. Side to side
separation was gained at the expense of front to back
separation. CBS called its matrix "SQ" (Stereo Quad-
driphonic), only adding to the confusion, (see fig. 5)
It is not really correct to talk about the SQ or the QS or
the E-V matrix because there have been several versions
of each. The original E-V was changed to make it
compatible with each other but they are still essentially
incompatible.
In the U.S., Columbia's SQ has dominated the record
market and SQ decoders are included in most Four
Channel hardware sold in America. Sansui's QS dominates
in Japan.

A Logical Return
The biggest advancement in matrixing has come with
the return of logic curcuits to enhance separation. Pete
Scheiber's original system was a flop, but it provided the
stepping stone to better, more sophisticated logic systems.
The first form of logic to be used was gain-riding
logic. Columbia utilized it to improve the poor front
to back separation of their SQ. It was similar in operation
to Scheiber's method. The logic circuits scan the front
channels and back signals to determine which is trying
to dominate. If the front channels dominate, their intensity
is increased about 3 dB and the rear channels are cut
back about 10 dB. The opposite occurs when the rear
channels dominate.
The second type of logic to come into use is called
wave-matching logic. This type compares the energy levels
of all four channels to determine which channel dominates
and then proceeds to emphasize it. Claims as large as
20 dB of separation in all directions have been made for
this system.
The better logic systems incorporate both gain-riding
and wave-matching logic. These logic systems are rendered
useless when all channels are fully driven; however, this
is a more or less rare occurance. Sudden changes in the
volume of individual channels can occur when the channel
emphasis changes. The more carefully mixed recordings can
avoid these pitfalls and sometimes sound discrete when
played with full logic.

ducted an investigation of the psychoacoustic effects
underlying the detection of the direction of a sound
source. They found that direction is determined by the
relative intensity of our of phase signals reaching the
ear.
Using this information they designed a circuit to monitor
the phase and intensity of all four signals and determine
which channel is the loudest and producing the best
directionality. This channel is emphasized, not by varying
gain but by varying matrix coefficients. The matrix
coefficients are changed from moment to moment de-
pending on the signals. Sudden volume changes and the
ineffectiveness when all channels are driven is eliminated
by Sansui's logic. Sansui divides the audio spectrum into
two frequency bands for more effective control action.
They call their system Vario-Matrix.

The above track arrangements are necessary to make all cassette
systems compatible. Note that four channel operation requires
halving the stereo track width, a major drawback.
Discrete
Discrete systems provide the best performance achiev-
able in four channel sound, but require four separate signals
at all stages. This can cause almost as many problems as
matrixes.
The open reel tapes discussed earlier never caught
on although they provide good results. Excessive cost
and the lack of prerecorded tapes made them undesirable
to all but the most devoted audiophile.
Cassettes haven't made it either but not for the lack
of demand, the technical problems have held this
format back. Cassette's liscensor the Phillips Co. of
Holland, has imposed the restriction that all cassettes and
machines be compatible. Mono, stereo, and four channel
tapes must all play in each other's machines. The only way
to adapt the cassette format to four channel is to reduce
the already narrow track width (see fig. 6). This would
sacrifice the recent gains in signal-to-noise ratios and
frequency response, not to mention tape alignment prob-
lems. High fidelity four channel cassettes are still a
questionable reality.
The only tape format to meet with success has been
the right track cartridge. RCA introduced it and calls
it Q-8. This wasn't particularity exciting to the serious
audiophile because eight tracks have been notorious for
wow-and-flutter, low signal-to-noise ratios and poor fre-
quency response.
Discrete Discs
While everyone else was hassling over matrices the
Japanese Victor Co. dropped the bomb, so to speak. They
announced they had a practical method of recording
discrete four channel on discs. The basic technique is not
new, it had been proposed in the 1950's for recording
stereo but the present method of placing one channel on
each of the groove's "walls" proved simpler.
The J.V.C. system, called CD-4 (Compatible Discrete 4
Channel), involved recording the information for the extra
two channels on two ultrasonic carriers each recorded
on one of the grooves "walls" along with audio signals.
The ultrasonic carrier is frequency modulated with a
center frequency of 30,000 kHz. This does not mean
the frequency response of the carrier is 25 kHz.
J.V.C. made their system compatible with stereo and
mono by recording the RF+RB signal in stereo's right
channel and the LF+LB in stereo's left channel. The
audio signals to reconstruct the original four channels.
Channel separation is limited only by the separation
achieved by the pickup.
Special cartridges with frequency response up to 45 kHz
are necessary to recover all four channels and a de-
modulator/decoder is needed to decode the original in-
formation. These discs can be played on conventional
stereo systems without restriction.
Originally it was feared that the ultrasonic carrier
would be wiped away in the first few plays, especially
when played with conventional stereo cartridges. Con-
sequently, RCA developed a new record material with
better wear resistance. Special stylii have been designed
to reduce noise from the ultrasonic carriers and reduce
sensitivity to wear in the ultrasonic range. As the result,
tests have shown the CD-4 disc to be comparable to
conventional discs even after 100 plays (very few people
play a disc 100 times). It should be noted, though, that
CD-4 discs require a higher degree of cleanliness.
J.V.C. was given a big boost when RCA opted to go the
CD-4 rout. All new RCA releases are recorded using CD-4
While RCA has made a special effort to keep the price of
their records the same as stereo, matrixed records have
been demanding a premium price.
Broadcasting in Quad
Some FM stations are currently broadcasting matrixed
four channel but discrete four channel FM is waiting in the
wings. Last October the F.C.C. in conjunction with several
manufacturers and west coast radio stations conducted tests
on several proposed methods of broadcasting quad. The
F.C.C. will base it's decisions on these tests but it may be
some time before they made a ruling. It was FM that
popularized stereo, it can be expected to do the same for
Four Channel.

FOREIGN STUDENTS IN THE COLLEGE
by Gerald Worn
The College of Engineering at the University of Michigan
today has an international student body that represents
young men and women from almost every corner of the
world. Foreign students comprise almost 9% of the
engineering students. Although all of us are receiving the
same education here as any other American student, our
experiences and reactions as college students are quite
different.
Most of us come to UM for two reasons. First, we
come here for certain areas of study that are not available
back home. Fields like Aerospace Engineering, Bioengineer-
ing. Industrial Engineering, and Nuclear Engineering are
not available in many universities outside of the United
States. Also, many advanced and specialized areas in the
popular Civil, Electrical, and Mechanical Engineering are
not available in foreign universities. Secondly, the College
of Engineering has always had enough foreign students in
the past to form an "advertising agency" for itself. Once
in a while, a foreign student would write home and tell
his friends: "... if you are looking for a U.S. college,
why not come to UM . . . it's a good school ... at
least I'm here and I can take care of you when you
arrive ..." In fact, there are quite a number of foreign
students who come here partly because they know friends
studying at UM.
Coming to the United States for an education is not
just as simple as "flying across the ocean on a 747."
Most of us had undergone considerable hardships from
the day we decided to go abroad to study to the day
we are able to understand what the professor is talking
about in class. The first obvious requirement is that we
know English. All of us have studied English for at
least seven years back home. And studying English in a
place where few people speak the language is not easy.
The only chance you get to practice English is probably
in class. Once you are out of class, you will seldom
use it unless you watch an American T.V. show, or
read Newsweek, or Playboy etc. To prove that we are able
to use the language fluently, we are required to take
examinations. The most popular one is called TOEFL
(Test of English as a Foreign Language).
To be accepted into the College of Engineering, we
are not only required to have a good score in our high
school record and in TOEFL. We must also be at least
in the sophomore level academically. The College of
Engineering seldom accepts foreign students that are in
the freshman or sophomore level. The reason behind this is
to allow foreign students to get a "feeling of" college life
in the United States before transferring to the "extra
tough" UM College of Engineering. Almost every foreign
student here in the College transferred from another
U.S. college and would agree that the average work load
is much heavier. For those who transferred directly
from universities back home, they will have a much
tougher time. They would have to learn to adapt to
a new environment and try to study at the same time.
We have great difficulties in communication the first
few months here at UM. It affects us both academically
and socially. How often does a native Engineering student
look up words in a dictionary when he is studying techni-
cal subjects like calculas or physics. But we do. There are
always key words that we do not understand. Also we have

Some companies still start you off
with a number of weeks of training
courses. Then a number of months
in one department. A number in
another. And so on.
Not Celanese. We're still growing
too fast to fuss with that sort of thing.
We won't crank you through a
long, tedious training program.
You'll be assigned immediately to a
project, one that tests and develops
your skills. It's your project. Your
responsibility. If you need help,you'll
get it. But nobody will be breathing
down your neck. This means, of
course, that you're judged entirely
on performance. And grow as fast
as your ability allows.
If you're a mechanical or chemical
engineer, or chemist who'd welcome
this kind of professional freedom,
we'd especially like to talk to you now.
We'll tell you that Celanese ranks
among the top five U.S. chemical
companies. That sales are over 1.5
billion dollars annually. That we
have large and expanding stakes in
four important high-technology in-
dustries—fibers, chemicals, plastics
and coatings. That, although our re-
sources are great, our day-to-day
operations are highly decentralized.
That you'll find a shirt-sleeve, first-
name feeling of openness, where you
know and work with the people who
make the decisions. And a lot more
about why you'll find Celanese a good
place to carve out a rewarding career.

Q.
tzl_r\N tbC/l'i equal opportunity employer m/f


For the first couple of months, most of us do not talk to
American students. Either because we find it hard to ex-
press ourselves in English, or that they find it hard to under-
stand us and stay away from us. How would you like re-
peating every sentence two or three times slowly to
another person?
The language problem does not exist only in students,
but also in members of the faculty who are foreign. Many
students, both American and foreign, find it very difficult
to listen to lectures presented by some foreign teaching
fellows. But it is especially hard for the foreign student to
understand English spoken by a non-native speaker of
English. The accents are very different which is confusing
to any person. As a result, many of the students have to
"work on their own" in these courses.
The language barrier is not the only difficulty we have.
More so than many people, we have financial difficulty.
Even before we come to the U.S., we have to show docu-
ments to the United States Consulate Office in our country
proving we are 'financially' qualified to go to the U.S. These
documents include bank savings accounts of parents or
sponsors, stock holdings,, bonds, etc. In some countries,
applicants have to show their parents or sponsors have in
their savings accounts the equivalent of four years of ex-
penses in the United States, and that this sum of money
had been in their savings accounts for a certain period of
time. (This is to prevent someone from borrowing a sum of
money just for a while.) In other words, if one wants to
come to UM on Sept., 1974, in some countries his parents
must have at least U.S. $4,000 X 4 = $16,000 in their ac-
counts as early as, say, March, 1973!
A college education in the United States is extremely
expensive compared to many countries of the world. How
much is an equivalent college education cost in other
countries?

Naturally, not many can afford such a shocking price.
But things sometimes happen and we are not able to
get financial support from home after some period of time.
In this case, we have to turn to one of the three alternatives:
get a scholarship, find a job, or pack our bags and go
home. There are very limited amount of funds available for
foreign student scholarships. Therefore granting foreign
financial aid does not necessarily mean that American
students are deprived of their privileges for aids. Despite
the College claim that aid is given primarily on the basis of
"need" and then on "grades", the reverse always seems
true. There are many cases when a rich foreign student
gets aid and a poor student, who has a slightly lower G.P.A.
receives nothing. This is because evaluation of a foreign
student's financial situation is difficult. The evaluation is
based solely on the application form; there is no means of
checking the information given.
Finding a job as a non-citizen is very difficult, especially
when the country is in a recession. There are some part
time jobs available, but usually these do not help out much.
Most of the students who support themselves by working
summers have a very hard time, especially if they are
working for employers who are not natives of this country.
The employers take advantage of the foreign students
by saying that since they are not U.S. citizens, they are not
supposed to work, but now that they are hired, they will
be paid below the minimum wage, or work eleven hours a
day with no overtime . . . etc. in order to compensate for
the "risk" of hiring non-U.S. citizens! Working conditions
are terrible in some "foreign" restaurants, for example.
I have seen students who wash dishes by hand without a
pair of gloves for ten hours a day. Imagine hands soaked in
corrosive detergent for ten hours . . . Well, if you need the
money, I guess you have to suffer a little . ..
There are two "types" of foreign students in the College
of Engineering. The majority is called the "studious" type
who put in twice as much time studying than the average
American student. The main reason is that we have another
type of pressure on us called "responsibility". We have a
great responsibility to our parents or our sponsors, who
spent so much effort and money to get us to the United
States, hoping that we can get a decent and "high-class"
education. It would be a disgrace if we fly thousands of
miles back home having flunked out. To an American
student however failing to succeed in a college education is
definately not an end to everything. There are always other
things to do, and other colleges to enroll in. Therefore,
this sense of "pressure from responsibility" is very unique
and is the biggest pressure exerted on us.
The other type is called the "loaded" type. They come
to the U.S. mainly because they are rich enough. They
wanted to come here either because of academic, or
political pressures back home. U.S. colleges are places to
"retreat and relax".

studying at UM is a very interesting and challenging exper-
ience. We feel we are being treated very fairly by both
faculty and native students here in the College of Engineer-
ing. In fact, many faculty members even make a special
effort to see the language barrier does not affect our
academic work. In the past three years, I have only heard
of two cases of discrimination, involving the same faculty
member (now retired). This professor would come into
class at the beginning of the semester and tell the class that
foreign students should not expect to get an A grade in his
course because they cannot write English well. Even if the
latter is true, students should not be discouraged at the
beginning of the term. What is more unreasonable is that
the course is not even a rhetoric, or a humanities course
but an Engineering course!
There are many things about which we feel "impressed"
at the College of Engineering: the fantastic operation of
the IBM 360/67 computer, and the fact that it will be re-
placed by an even bigger and faster IBM 370/168 computer
in the Winter, 1975 term; the keen competition in academic
grades, compared to many smaller U.S. colleges we have
transferred from; the signing of the "Honor Code" during
quizes and examinations. Many of us simply do not see how
writing a sentence on a bluebook can deter a person from
cheating, especially when the instructor is not around.
And finally, where does the University get donations for
buildings on North Campus. In foreign universities, dona-
tions from alumni are not large enough for construction.
Socially, we can get along well with most American
students. They are interested in knowing more about our
country, and we are equally interested in learning about
the "typical American college life." Things like going
out to "boogie" on weekends and watching a football
game (the "wierd" sport that is played only in North
America and no where else in the world!) with a can of beer
in hand. Incidentally, it takes quite a while for a foreigner
to understand a football game and it takes even longer for
him to enjoy watching it. (about 18 months!)
As a whole, the faculty members of the College of
Engineering, the American students and the Interna-
tional students are moving along extremely well here at
the College of Engineering. Foreign students look towards
the native students as a source of advice, help, and fun. On
the other hand, we provide native students an opportunity
to learn something about the other side of the world. Both
groups learn and experience how to get along internation-
ally and peacefully. Both look towards the faculty as a
source of learning and challenge. All three groups look
forward to a vacation break ....

FOURTH IN A SERIES

With depletion of our natural resources in sight, the
world will be turning more and more to an electric energy
economy. This is primarily because electricity can be put
into a useful form, such as flourescent light or resistive
heat, with high efficiency. Coupled with improvements
in the efficiency of energy use, new sources of energy
must be developed to meet the demands of the electric
energy economy, the most important of these being the
nuclear reactor. In this article I shall look at the status
of this highly controversial energy source, and some of the
future plans for fusion power.
Types of Nuclear Reactors
There are four important types of fission reactors
operating, or planned for the future: pressurized water
reactors, boiling water reactors, gas cooled reactors and
breeder reactors. In both the pressurized and boiling water
types, light water (as opposed to 'heavy' water, which
has an extra neutron on each of the hydrogen atoms, also
called 'deuterium oxide') circulates through the hot reactor
core and carries the heat energy to steam turbine gener-
ators. The difference between the two is that the water in
the PWR goes to steam generator and is liquid throughout
the first loop (fig. 1). In a boiling water reactor the
coolant passes directly to the turbines, eliminating the
secondary loop. In a gas cooled reactor helium is used
to transfer the energy of the core to the heat exchanger.
The majority of the nuclear power plants in the United
*The reader is referred to texts such as Kaplan, Nuclear
Physics for a description of fission and fusion reactions.
States is the light water variety, while Britain is using
primarily gas cooled reactor plants.
These reactors are called "thermal" because the neu-
trons in the fission process travel at "thermal" velocities,
typically 2200 meters/second. In the so-called "fast"
reactors the neutrons travel at about 9000 times this
speed.* Because of this fast neutron activity "breeding"
can take place, that is, more new fissile nuclei are pro-
duced than are consumed. At a breeding ratio of about
1.3 the compound doubling time is about 13 years. In
the advanced-design breeders planned for the future this
doubling time will be reduced to 7.8 years.' The coolant
in proposed breeders is molten sodium, because it does
not slow the neutrons as the moderator in thermal
reactors does. (fig. 2). There are no breeder reactors
operating commercially now, but the newly established
Nuclear Regulatory Commission is reviewing the license
application for the Clinch River Breeder Reactor in
Tennessee. The facility is an LMFBR (liquid metal fast
breeder reactor) demonstration plant scheduled for oper-
ation in 1982.
The Clinch River Breeder Reactor Construction permit was
denied on the basis that the application lacked sufficient
information for detailed review. Once the required informa-
tion is submitted, the AEC will formally review the applica-
tion. This news was announced after the deadline for
publications at the Technic office had passed.

familiar terms.

Some Statistics
As of December 1973, 199 nuclear power plants were
operating, under construction, or pending licensing. This
represents 187, 779 Mw of electrical generating capacity
at an estimated cost of $74.4 billion. This trend, shown
in tables 1 and 2, will probably decline sharply this
year and become established in the future, depending
on how the economy goes. The results of research by NERA
(National Economic Research Associates) regarding recently
announced cancellations by the various utilities are re-
produced in table 3. The fact that nuclear plants comprise
the greater part of these cancellations is unfortunate; the
fuel costs for operation of a nuclear power plant are
substantially lower than for fossil-fueled plants, and this
tends to dominate the higher capital cost of a nuclear
plant." ... the economics of power plant construction
and operation favor nuclear over fossil-fueled plants,
the burden of curtailments should fall more heavily on
planned fossil additions," stated Dr. L.J. Perl, vice president
of NERA, before a conference of the Atomic Industrial
Forum^ Table 4 shows the generation costs for oil,
coal, and nuclear powered plants.
In terms of safety, nuclear reactor plants have a spot-
less record. There has never been a fatility caused by the
accidental release of radiation from a nuclear reactor. Six

people have died in criticality accidents resulting in
$4.5 million in damage. One such accident was the
excursion at the SL-1 reactor in Idaho on January 3, 1961.
A maintenance crew was assembling a control rod mechan-
ism and, against all correct procedure, manually removed
the control rod. Power levels rose higher than was safe for
the reactor and an explosion occurred (not as in an atomic
bomb) killing three of the crew members and causing $4.35
million in property damage. ^ This is to be contrasted
with the case of a chemist who was killed by radiation
poisoning when he prepared a solution containing a
critical amount of plutonium. The chemist received a
radiation dosage sixty times greater than any reactor
exposure incident.^ It is important to note that most
of these criticality accidents did not involve reactor plants,
and that the incidents were a result of human error rather
than faulty design.

much strontium-90 and other long lived radioactive poisons
as the fissioning of about 1,200,000 Hiroshima bombs .. ."
In the same pamphlet the Committee presents a very
rosy picture of a world whose energy problems could
be solved through "safe and natural" solar power. To
back up their point they quote from a report by the
National Science Foundation on the potential of solar
power:
By the year 2020 solar energy could economically
provide up to—
35% of the total building heating and cooling load,
30% of the nations gaseous fuel,
10% of the liquid fuel,
20% of the electric energy requirements.^
No one disputes these predictions, but can we wait until
year 2020 for solar energy to solve our problems?
What seems to elude the intervenors in their pro-
nouncements are the facts of exponential growth. This
country, let alone the world, is going to need increasing
amounts of energy, despite what the advocates of no-growth
policies suggest. Even if population and capital investment
were stabilized, the delays inherent in the world system
would insure the critical depletion of our natural resources.
Even if all Americans were to accept a 40% reduction in
their personal consumption of energy (as Mr. Nader
suggests, neglecting to explain how it is to be done)
the rest of the world would go on using energy at increasing
rates. Does anyone think that the policies of birth
control and economic stabilization needed for a "no-
growth" society will be forthcoming?
Recently the construction of several nuclear power
plants has been cancelled or delayed. It is important
to remember that this is an economic problem; it isn't
because the plants aren't working. The construction in-
dustry has been suffering the impact of rising interest
rates for years and nuclear power plants are no exception.
Their high capital costs make them especially vulnerable.
What this may mean is that more money will have to be
diverted from other science programs, such as the space
flights, so that work in the development of energy
resources and high efficiency technology may continue.
Until a solar energy economy can be created and until
the fusion reactor can be put on line, something must
fill the gap. With the oil situation becoming unstable, coal
and nuclear plants, which are economically competitive,
will have to be built. As mentioned before, of oil,
coal, and nuclear fired plants, the latter has the lowest
generation costs. With pollution standards as they are,
nuclear will win out over coal because of the desulfur-
ization equipment costs on coal plants.
There's Fusion in Your Future
Nuclear energy promises to be one of the most im-
portant new fields as the world becomes less dependent
on fossil fuels. In a forecast by the AEC, 1200 Gwe of
electrical generating capacity will be installed by the
year 2000 ( a more likely forecast would be lower
owing to current economic trends). This means that the
equivalent of twelve hundred 1000 Mwe plants will have
to be designed, built and operated by highly skilled
people. There is also research to be done in the breeder
reactor program: The AEC has published a "problem state-
ment" of goals and tasks in LMFBR development which
takes up 2% bookshelf feet. But by far the most promising
nuclear energy source is fusion.
Fusion means not merely a different plant design,
it means an entirely different nuclear process. It is the
mechanism of the sun's energy, unleashing 3.8 x 10*°
joules every second, 173 x 10^ joules of which fall
upon the surface of the Earth. At the Sun's center the
temperature is 20 million degrees Kelvin and the densities
exceed 100 times the density of water; under these
conditions the fusion reaction proceeds spontaneously.
While this environment can not be duplicated in the
laboratory, a highly energized plasma can be generated by
pumping energy into it in short time intervals. In these
plasmas the deuterium-tritium reaction can take place.
A major problem is the containment of the plasma: the
hot, ionized, gaseous matter will vaporize the walls of any
ordinary vessel. Several designs of containment reactors are
being developed at laboratories across the country. The
main types are the magnetic confinement and the laser
driven reactors. In the "magnetic bottle" design electro-
magnetic coils are positioned so that when a plasma is
injected it remains stable (fig. 3). In the laser driven design
a small pellet made of deuterium and tritium is vaporized
by a high energy laser pulse. As the outer portion of the
spherical pellet boils off the pressure of the expanding
gases causes the remaining solid pellet to implode. The
implosion theoretically results in conditions for the fusion
reaction to proceed. KMS Fusion, Inc. of Ann Arbor has
been at the forefront of fusion research and is now
developing laser fusion techniques.
There are features of fusion power that make it inherent-
ly safe. When a plasma is released from confinement the
fusion activity falls off very rapidly. Also the fuel require-
ments of the d-t reactor are very simple. Deuterium can
be found in ordinary water and tritium can be produced
by bombarding lithium with neutrons. Once the reactor
has been operating for a while, enough tritium will be
produced in the lithium blanket to make further ship-
ments of tritium unnecessary. If some of this lithium were
to leak into the water cooling loop the hydrogen gas
produced would not raise the pressure enough to do any
damage.
I have not tried in this article to cover all of the
aspects of nuclear power, nor to examine any one aspect
in overwhelming detail. Not enough space has been given
to the safety of nuclear reactors, nor to an explanation of
fusion power. In future issues of the Technic there will
appear reports on waste disposal, fusion power, breeder
reactors and other important topics. This article is an in-
troduction, an attempt to stimulate interest and intel-
lectual debate. Nuclear power is a field which combines
many areas of engineering and with which all engineers
should be familiar.

Glossary
Blanket: in a breeder reactor it is U^° placed in the core so as to
produce fissile material from fast neutron reactions. In a fusion
reactor it is the lithium or other material that is converted into
tritium during operation.
Breeding ratio: a ratio representing the number of fissile nuclei
produced for every fissile nucleus consumed.
BWR: Boiling Water Reactor
Capital costs: Costs representing the actual construction of the
plant, involving land, labor, materials, etc. As opposed to fuel
costs or operation and maintenance costs.
Control rod: a piece of neutron absorbing material which when
placed in a reactor core will slow the fission rate.
Core: the arrangement of fissile material in a reactor; the structure
containing the material.
Critical: a reaction in which the fission rate is constant; if the
rate is increasing with time it is supercritical, if decreasing it is
u (critical.
Deuterium: a hydrogen atom having an extra neutron in the
nucleus; the nucleus is called a deuteron. Heavy water (U.,0!
has the property of slowing neutrons very quickly.
Doubling time: the time required for some quantity which is
growing exponentially to become twice as great as at some previous
time.
Exponential growth: growth following the relation
Q - Q0a'
where t is time, Q the quantity at time t, QQ the quantity at t = 0,
a is a constant.
Fission: a nuclear reaction in which a heavy nucleus absorbs a
neutron and splits into fragments. Example:
235u + Jn •» 140CS + 93Rb + 3on
Thus, the three neutrons produced can lead to more fissioning
and so on.
fusion: a nuclear reaction in which a light nucleus combines with
another light nucleus. Example, a D-T reaction:
fr + ^D*$He + £n+ 17.6MeV
Gwe: giga watts electrical. Giga = 109.lndicates the actual electrical
output rather than the thermal output (Gwt, gigawatts thermal).
HTGR: high temperature gas cooled reactor.
Intervenor: a legal term, not one devised by nuclear engineers.
When a hearing is being held, for example, on licensing of nuclear
power plants, an interested party may be included in the proceedings
if they have important information to present.
Joule: a unit of energy defined as the work done by a force of one
newton over a distance of one meter. A watt is a joule per second.
LMFBR: liquid metal fast breeder reactor.
Moderator: a material which slows neutrons to thermal velocities
(2200m/sec).
Mwe: megawatts electrical. Mega = 10 .
Plasma: a highly energetic, ionized gaseous state of matter.
Power excursion: a condition in a nuclear reactor where the fission
rate, and hence the power generated by the core, exceeds safe design
levels.
PWR: Pressurized Water Reactor.

As we look back over the years, it is apparent that the
concerns of students have changed very little. In the
thirties students here had the same types of problems that
engineering students are faced with today. There is a direct
correlation between the economies. The students then were
also faced with the problem of financing their education
in a recession.
In order to get full benefit from their hard earned
money, students worked to get everything possible out of
their education. For some students it meant complete
emersion in their studies. They would walk into class
study until lecture started and leave immediately following.
These students ended up knowing the material, but knew
very little about getting along with other people.
Other students pushed for a well rounded education
and became involved with student organizations. Many
of these organizations such as Tau Beta Pi, Engin Council,
A.S.M.E., A.S.C.E., Vulcans and Pi Tau Sigma are around
today, while others have died. Triangles was the junior
honorary society which tapped students who were active
in student organizations. Sigma Rho Tau, better known as
the Stump Speaker Society, was a forensic society which
would present their oratories from the cement stump near
the Arch. (Which should explain the stump and the circle
of benches by West Engineering). Sigma Xi was the
honorary research fraternity.
If politics was more interesting to the student, there
were Student Government Council, Engineering Council and
Class Offices. Student Government Council was very cor-
rupt and eventually disbanded. "As one well known
professor rather appropriately puts it, 'It has been interes-
ting to be on the outside looking in and watching the
children playing about with the deceits and treacheries of
the really grown up political world. But, frankly, it is more
damaging to their usefulness (sic) as good citizens than
anything we could allow them to do for it destroys every
bit of their respect for public office."^ That could be a
quote about last year's SGC. Engin Council was rather
inactive and was used as an arbitration board for organiza-
tions. Its main duties were managing class elections, caps
and gowns for graduation, and the Engineering Smoker.
Class Officers collected dues, tried to unify their class,
and during thier junior year ran the junior jacket sales.
Students also began to take a more active role in
administrative decisions. They pushed very hard for open
book exams in upper level departmental and non-depart-
mental required engineering courses. Courses such as phy-
sics and math were to remain closed book since every
engineer needed to know this material. Open book exams
were advocated because engineers in the field did not rely
on their memories but were able to look up the information
when they needed it. It was also decided that an engin-
eer needed a more rounded education, so the humanities
requirements were increased.
Over the years the problems and behavior of the students
here have changed very little. Many direct parallels can be
drawn between the students of the thirities and those
now. The technology is more advanced and there is more
to learn, but student life is basically the same. The idea of
getting a complete education and being a well rounded
individual is as important now as it was then. It will be
interesting to see if the students in fifty years have the
same basic interests and problems as today.

ThE
FUTURE
Prediction of the future is risky business; no one has yet
invented a foolproof crystal ball. Therefore, it can't be ex-
pected that anyone will be able to predict details with 100%
accuracy; however, general trends are somewhat easier and
less prone to error. Of course, one cannot account for un-
foreseeable trends, discoveries, or events which often can
change history drastically. Two problems that most often
block people from thinking rationally about the future
are the failure of nerve and the failure of imagination.
Arthur C. Clarke has devoted a good deal of attention to
these ideas and has illustrated them with classic examples
from history in his book entitled Profiles of the Future.
It has proven a common mistake to underestimate the
future; we are all familiar with many "they said it couldn't
be done" stories: the automobile, the electric light bulb,
the airplane, etc. When Edison announced in 1878 that he
was working on an incandescent lamp (he already had a
formidable reputation as an inventor) gas company stocks
plummeted. The British government set up an investiga-
tive committee which reported that the light bulb ideas
were "good enough for our trans-atlantic friends . . . but
unworthy of the attention of practical or scientific men."
Even stronger statements were made against the possibility
of a heavier than air flying machine. In this case the
criticisms were not restricted to the general public or to
governmental committees but were also made by most of
the scientific and engineering communities as well. And
even stronger still were comments on the idea of any kind
of space flight. There are many examples of scientists,
using very detailed calculations and seemingly sound
reasoning, who proved that space flight was impossible.

were the assumptions.
A prime example is that of Professor A.W. Bickerton,
who in 1926 proved (at least to himself) that flight to the
moon was impossible. He carefully worked out the energy
per gram necessary to escape earth's gravitational field and
reach the moon and then pointed out that the energy per
gram of the most violent explosive known (nitroglycerin)
was only one-tenth of this critical energy. One mistake he
made was in thinking that a violent explosion was what was
needed. Many chemical reactions which were known even
in his day give much greater energy per gram than nitro-
glycerin, kerosene with oxygen, for example. But even this
is beside the point. He assumed that he would be propelling
the explosive itself. What needs to be done, in this
example, is to impart the explosive's energy to a payload
to be sent to the moon. Thus, all that would be needed is
ten pounds of nitroglycerin per pound of payload.
One of the mistakes often made by would-be prophets is
to remain fixed in thinking in present day terms. This is like
saying that everything to be discovered already has been.
Fortunately, once in a while an original thinker comes along
to upset the trend. Perhaps the greatest example of this was
Leonardo Da Vinci. His work included designs of things that
had to wait centuries of invention and discovery before
they came to pass. Another who was able to free his
imagination was Friar Bacon (c. 1214 - 1292). He
thought of things whose principles he could not have
understood or even foreseen. The following is an excerpt
from his writings, and try to remember that this came from
the thirteenth century:
Instruments may be made by which the largest ships,
with only one man guiding them, will be carried with
greater velocity than if they were full of sailors,
chariots may be constructed that will move with incre-
dible rapidity without the help of animals. Instruments
of flying may be formed in which a man, sitting at his
ease and meditating in any subject, may beat the air
with his artificial wings after the manner of birds . . .
as also machines which will enable men to walk at the
bottom of the seas...
There are more examples of men who were able to see
ahead of their times, and, alas, even more of those who
couldn't. But the point has been made. To anticipate the
future one must free oneself of present-day conceptions
of the possible and the impossible. It is only then that any
attempt to understand and predict the future can succeed.
Clarke has summed the matter up quite well in the Clarke's
Law: "When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that
something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he
states that something is impossible, he is very probably
wrong." Note: "elderly" today in physics, mathematics,
and astronautics means anyone over thirty, according to
Clarke. Unless a basic physical law prohibits something
from being done, and sometimes even if it does, it will
be done. It may occur overnight, or it may take a
thousand years, imb^

FEATURE -
Prof. Harry Benford
by Steve Haynack
The Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering Depart-
ment is deeply concerned with the development of bigger,
more economical ships engaged in oil transport. Bigger
ships mean fewer ships, and the decreased number of oil
tankers will reduce the chances of collisions and resulting
oil spills devastating the seas and shores. The Naval
Architecture Department maintains a large wave and man-
euvering basin in the G.G. Brown Laboratory on North
Campus. Under support from the U.S. Coast Guard, naval
architecture researchers are now testing a number of
devices designed to contain and clean up oil spills. More
fundamentally, the same facility is being used (in alternate
periods) to study the maneuvering characteristics of super-
tankers in shallow water. This work, being done under NSF
support, will play a role in preventing oil spills from occurr-
ing in the first place.
While Professor Harry Benford is optomistic on this
phase of ship design, he is not too enthused over the newer
creations — the hydrofoils and the air-cushion vehicles,
calling them noisy, inefficient oil burners. He says that
"What is needed in this area is a new lightweight, compact,
and safe nuclear reactor. He thinks fusion reactors may
eventually provide the answer.
Even though he wasn't born in Michigan, and he loves
to travel. Professor Harry Benford still has deep roots in the
Ann Arbor area. Born in 1917 in Schenectady, New York,
where the closest navigable body of water was the Barge
Canal, he reveals, "It was the seafarer's blood in my
mother" that had something to do with his coming to
Ann Arbor in 1935 to study naval architecture.
One evening in his freshman year, he went on his
first blind date with a girl named Elizabeth Smallman from
Martha Cook. They married five years later. Now they
have three sons, one of whom is a U. of M. engineering
graduate.
Professor Benford graduated in 1940 and went to work
at the shipyard in Newport News, Virginia. He remembers
that calculations were "real dry work" without the compu-
ters of today. Because there is no formula for the hull form
of a ship, all mathematics had to be done by hand - no
plug-in equations. Prof. Benford feels, "The computer has
aided naval architecture tremendously, perhaps more than
any other engineering field."
In 1948, he came back to U. of M. and was appointed
to an assistant professorship although he had, and still has
today, only a B.S.E. degree.
However, after he had begun teaching the design courses
he realized that, based on his experience at the shipyards,
existing design methods left much to be desired; they didn't
adequately prepare the student for a job in the marine
industry. This realization was what launched Prof. Benford's
career.
While he did have experience in some aspects of ship
design, his knowledge of economics was limited. So he
became self-educated in economics, applied a common
sense approach to ship design, and called the process cost-
analysis. This involved the basic premise that a commercial
ship is an investment in a profit-making business. The
central idea revolved around the fact that owners of the
ship wanted the ship that could provide a socially useful
service in the most profitable way. Because Professor Ben-
ford laid the groundwork and developed the practical
applications of cost analysis, he can be acknowledged as a
pioneer of the field.
Being the originator of a new idea, many opportunities
for writing and speaking assignments were opened — and
30


those chances. His lecture tours and love of travel have led
him abroad thirteen times in the past ten years. He has
lectured at universities and conferences in Berlin, Brazil,
Japan and Australia, as well as all over the United States and
Canada.
His writings are as varied as the countries to which he
has traveled. "Computer-aided economic studies of Pre-
liminary Ship Design," "Economic Criteria for Decision-
Making in the Transport Industry", and "Your Future in
Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering" are some of
the ship-design-related books and pamphlets Prof. Benford
has written.
He was commissioned by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers to make recommendations about future ship
sizes regarding construction of a new lock at Sault Ste.
Marie. Professor Benford advocated as a minimum a lock
capable of handling 1000-foot long and 100-foot wide
ore freighters, and the new Poe Locks were built about
five years ago according to his specifications. (A leaflet
concerning this research is in the Undergraduate Library.)
Other books related to his work are there also.
He has had a bright orange, soft-covered, 24 page manual
printed at his own expense entitled, "The Literate Naval
Architect," in which he details common errors in grammar,
spelling, and punctuation for forgetful naval architects,
and schemes for their correction. Professor Benford calls
it his best seller — he gives it away.
During 1959-1960, he took a leave of absence to be head
of staff for a committee within the National Academy of
Sciences — National Research Council.
. . . From 1966 to 1971, he was chairman of the Navai
Architecture and Marine Engineering Department.
For the past thirty years Professor Benford has been an
enthusiastic admirer of Gilbert and Sullivan, writer and
composer respectively, of thirteen comic operas during the
reign of England's Queen Victoria. He has been continually
impressed ever since by their relevancy and timelessness.
Both he and his wife, Betty, are occupied by publishing
a monthly newsletter dedicated to spreading the good word
about Gilbert and Sullivan. One of the highlights of
Professor Benford's career happened when he gave a lecture
at Purdue University - not at a ship design conference -
for a theatre class called "Wit and Wisdom of Gilbert and
Sullivan." (I was given some advice before the interview
by a student who'd had Professor Benford for a course, who
said, "If you or he start to get bored, just mention 'Gilbert
and Sullivan' and he'll wake up, but you won't be able to
talk about anything else. " That wasn't quite true.)
In regard to the employment situation. Professor Ben-
ford recommends strongly that you, the graduating senior,
definitely look into the opportunities to be provided by
the potential employer. He quotes an old engineering
maxim, "In engineering practice, you should devote 30
percent of your professional time to continuing your
education. Ten percent so that you don't forget what you
learned in college. Ten percent to stay on top of your field.
Ten percent to be a better engineer that those young
graduates."
Professor Benford warns against specialization within a
narrow field, or any over specialization, with good reason.
He believes that creativity comes from combining differing
viewpoints. So therefore, become proficient in areas other
than your specialty so that you will see a problem in a
different light, from various angles. Be aware that a
college education is not a prerequisite for creativity, but
that originality is enhanced through knowledge.
Professor Benford also mentions a tabulation of a
questionnaire sent out to U of M Naval Architecture
engineering graduates who'd been on the job for three to
five years. They concurred, by a margin of over two to one,
that what they lacked most was the ability to write clearly.
And that is just what Professor Benford is talking about. He
says he first started writing because he was inspired by the
demand for good writers and because he was interested in
the field, in informing people, and in entertaining them.
He suggests, "When you write, write for people to under-
stand."
Professor Benford advises engineers to take up a hobby
that doesn't involve engineering in order to have a balance
between work and relaxation. This is just what Professor
Benford has done with the Gilbert and Sullivan operas.
Professor Harry Benford has designed a means for a
successful career in engineering — combining a knowledge

engineers who were
born to lead.
Are you the kind of engineer who has what it takes to move into management someday?
If you are, you already know it.
Now what you need to know is which companies can offer you the best oppor-
tunities. We think you'll find General Electric is one.
We're a high technology company. And that means we have to have manag-^
ers who understand technology—women and men—to run the place.
Today, over 60% of the top managers at General Electric hold technical
degrees. In fact, over 65% of the college graduates we hired last year held
technical degrees.
Of course, just leadership ability and a technical degree won't get
you into management. First, you're going to need solid engineering
experience and a broad understanding of business.
And we have a lot of ways to help you get it.
One is our Manufacturing Management Program. A two-year
program of rotating assignments that gives you broad experience
with different products and manufacturing processes.
Another is our Engineering Program. For engineers with an
interest in product and systems design and development.
There's also a Field Engineering Program, a Technical Market-
ing Program, plus a number of programs sponsored by product
operations.
And all with just one aim. To give you all the responsi-
bility and all the perspective you need to move into man-
agement. As fast as you can manage it.
Of course, starting on a program isn't the only way
to make it into management at GE. If you have a
specific product interest, we have many direct-
placement opportunities that can get your career
started fast, too.
What kinds of products can you work on
at GE? Over 230,000 different ones.
Maybe nuclear power plants. Or
more efficient fossil-fuel plants. Or
better mass-transit systems. Or medical
equipment. Pollution controls.
Engineering plastics. Cleaner, quieter
jet engines. Communications products.
You name it.

We have gotten a few comments on the "For Sale" sign
that we hung on the outside of West Engin last month.
Most people appreciated the joke, and we even got a few
offers. Unfortunately, it was taken down early in the day,
so quite a few people never saw it. As for the perpetrators
of the deed, their identities shall forever remain a secret.
We were somewhat disappointed that it never made the
Oa//X-they weren't impressed enough, I guess. Maybe they
will be impressed enough when we do it to President
Fleming's house.
We also got some feedback on the changes that were
made in the last issue. Several people wanted to see the
quotes page return, and since "several" is quite a lot where
our feedback is concerned, we probably will re-instate it
again in the fall.
This issue could well be called our Growth-No Growth
Issue. The subject, or controversy, of the growthless society
has become more and more relevant as Planet Earth reels
under the growing economic crunch (which is about the
only thing growing these days). Last fall, the Humanities
Dept., in conjunction with the Program in Engineering
for Public Systems, sponsored a series of lectures titled
"On the Consequences of No-Growth Policies." But even
before that, the subject had been tossed about some, to the
extent that an essay on no-growth policies, written by Dan
Holloway, Ch. E. '74, won the 1974 Cooley Essay contest.
Belatedly keeping with a long established Technic policy,
we publish his essay, "Prospects for Technology and Man-
kind" in this month's Technic.
Complimenting the Cooley essay, we have Dave Voss's
book review of Mankind at the Turning Point by Mihajlo
Mesorovic and Eduard Pestel. The book covers the authors'
work on developing a computer model of the world-system,
and using this model as a socio-economic-political predictor,
somewhat like Dennis Meadows's Limits to Growth; in fact,
Mankind at the Turning Point is intended to be a follow-up
to Meadows's work, and it reaches basically the same con-
clusions. Between them, these two articles on no-growth
comprise the fifth in our series on the engineer and his
environment.
Also in this issue, we try something new with Jim
Epperson's "The First Day." The article is a blend of
fiction and reminiscences about a freshman's first day at
the big U.
Of course, we keep our regular features, "The Good Old
Days" and our Teacher Feature, this month on Mech
Engin's Prof. Quackenbush. And, as a final note, this
piece of grafitti from an unknown source: "The brilliance
of today may be the sewage of tommorrow."

One of the most laughed at and talked about comedy
acts on campus is SGC — Student Government Council.
Everyone knows how corrupt and impotent it is, and
everyone gets a big kick out of following their antics in
that second-best comedy act, the Michigan Daily. To
most engineers, all of this is amusing but rather remote
and unimportant. There is, however, a student government
in the Engineering Council, and it does deserve some
attention. Engineering Council has often prided itself for
last year, when Bob Mathews tried to usurp the presidency
by suit, they have succeeded in avoiding any scandals like
those that envelop SGC. Unfortunately, they have also
succeeded in avoiding much in the way of accomplishments.
The usual fare of yearly Engin Council projects looks
something like this: at the end of each semester, they run
Tech Day, where incoming freshmen are given tours of the
several North Campus Labs; they also are in charge of the
Teacher Evaluations, and appointments to student-faculty
committees. These are rather routine functions, however.
The main purpose of Engin Council seems to be the
disbursement of funds for use by student groups in the
College. In fact, this has become so much a part of the
Coucil's business that they finally got around to setting
a policy for deciding who gets how much — this was at the
Feb 13 meeting.
In all fairness to Engin Council, however, the lack of
activity can not be laid entirely at their door. Nor should
the routine work that they do get downplayed. It seems
that the student body of the Engineering College suffers
from an acute case of apathy. The cause of the apathy is
unknown; its effect might be fatal.
This may come as a surprise to some of you out there,
but there is more to college! life than the inside of your
Sonntag and Van Wylan; and even more important, there
is more to an education than Prof. Whatsizname's lectures.
This is not to say that you should maybe ignore classes
(although I know some people who do), but compliment
them. You are paying no small amount of money to go to
school here, so maybe you should think about getting your
money's worth. Almost all of the student societies are
choking for a lack of students. They survive but it is the
same three people doing all of the work in about five organi-
zations each.
Participation, or the lack of it, is not all the apathy
affects. It is obvious that people just don't give a damn.
In the case of Engin Council, one gets the feeling that
they could try anything and still get zero response.
The TG's that they have started in the last year seem to be
generating some turnout, but they an engineer will do
anything for a beer. Come to think of it, the biggest
crowd of engineers that I ever saw same out to watch Pi
Tau Sigma's "Beer Lover's Le Mans" last spring.
Maybe that's what it takes. But meanwhile, between
slugs of Stroh's or Coors, or whatever, think about your
education and what you're getting - and not getting. Then
get off your rump and do something about it.

FIFTH IN A SERIES
The question of whether or not the Earth can
support the limitless growth of the past century
has only recently been considered. Rampant in-
flation, scarcity of resources, and starvation among
plenty clearly indicate that something is wrong
somewhere. The prospects for the future, however,
are the most frightening. Here the Technic presents
two articles each dealing in its own way with the
question of limitless growth.


A. Prospects for Growth in Modern Technology with
Zero Economic Growth: An Analysis and Conclusion
Technology in the pragmatic sense can be described as
merely a collection of tools, but, in essence, it is much
more. More importantly, it consists of an ideology regarding
the purpose of these tools and regarding a certain concept
of man in the universe.' Stated alternatively, this ideology
can be regarded as that part of the state of mind which
primarily concerns two ideas: 1) The idea of progress and
2) the idea of nature. This ideological 'sphere'encom-
passing technology must be specified with regard to these
two ideas before any conclusions can be arrived at con-
cerning technological growth3 in the absence of economic
growth". In order to analyze this ideological sphere within
the context of current civilization, the historical phenomena
which gave rise to the current beliefs regarding progress and
nature must be discussed.
Since the dawn of creation man's search for intrinsic
satisfaction and 'happiness' has been intimately entwined
in all of his pursuits. Happiness, in particular, is the all
embracing and naturally determined object of all acts of
will. Jacques Maritain wrote that it is the distinction of our
humanistic civilizations to place happiness in happiness, the
end of man in human happiness.^
Mere organic existence is not sufficient to attain this
ultimate sense of well-being, however, for through man's
everdeveloping, incessantly active brain, he has more mental
energy to tap than he needs for survival at a purely animal
level. The necessity of canalizing that energy and man's
desire to express his 'latent super organic potentialities'
is manifested through his pursuit for happiness. Thus the
concept of Progress, the continual fulfillment of certain
perceived essential and fundamental needs in man's cease-
less pursuit toward a state of well-being was born.
For many centuries predominant religious structures
provided avenues toward and transcendental goals of
'attained' happiness. Consequently, progress constituted
needs in the pursuit of wellbeing. Then, for a multitude of
men, it became 'apparent' that the kingdom of God was to
be realized here, and now, on this earth. It was at this point
that the spiritual idea of progress became material. Progress
in this new category secularized our goals, goals still far
beyond our reach, but almost universally believed to be
goals of ultimate well-being, a state to be obtained by our
continual fulfillment of perceived material needs.
This new idea of material progress as being synonymous,
with the road to 'happiness' and represented by our contin-
ual fulfillment of 'desired' material needs, along with the
necessarily consequential increase in our material 'standard
of living' through the accumulation of material wealth be-
*The term 'technological growth' in this paper will refer to the
punuit of effectiveness in producing desired results, material or
otherwise, depending upon the concept of progress within the
Pertinent ideological sphere.
kthe term 'economic Growth' will refer to the classical sense of
the word, increases of material output per man-hour input, often
called increased productivity, and with the principle end result
being an increase in the material 'standard of living.'
yond our basic organic needs, is best exemplified by Jeremy
Bentham's statement that, 1) Each portion of wealth has a
corresponding portion of happiness. 2) Of two individuals
with unequal fortunes, he who has the most wealth has the
most happiness.^ The age of material progress toward a
universally perceived 'transcendental' goal of well-being was
born.
And so technology, the instrument of progress, became
Modern Technology, the instrument of Material Progress.
Yet there is one other crucial element of the ideological
sphere encompassing Modern Technology which is as yet
unspecified. This element is man's view of nature, of man's
conception of his place in the universe.
The curretn idea of nature held by mankind traces its
roots back to the Renaissance. Long before the Renaissance,
the ideological sphere of Ancient Technology contained an
element different than Modern Technology's regarding
man's idea of nature. In Ancient Technology the wor,ld, in-
cluding man, was perceived as constituting nature under the
dominion of the gods. Nature was perceived as a separate
entity apart from man. During the Renaissance, however,
nature external to man was 'discovered.'4 Nature thus
became objectified and the basis was laid for the complete
characterization of the modern technological sphere.
The pathway was soon laid to quick progress in the
control of physical nature. For nature, first an object of
aesthetic contemplation, soon became the object of ex-
ploitation as the result of the efforts of such heralded
scientists as Francis Bacon, with their quantification of
nature.^ This Modern Technology became fully cha-acter-
ized: The instrument of Material Progress through its
growth and the conquest and subjugation of objectified
nature. The stage was then set for Modern Technology's
growth and resultant propulsion of Material Progress in
the civilized world to its present extent in our ceaseless
pursuit of the state of well-being.
Modern Technology grew slowly at first, motivated by
the element of its ideology promising ultimate well-being.
Material Progress. Other factors promising an 'additional'
happiness greater than that experienced by the general
social benefactors of material progress as a whole and
providing more immediate realization of this were often
instituted to further motivate potential innovators to
contribute to Material Progress. For instance, special
privileges were granted to innovators who had the favor of
rulers of European states. Work on the chronometer was
stimulated by the prize offered in France and England for
C
a means of determining longitude at sea.
Instilled esteem and professional pride also became
additional motivating factors in man's quest for material
progress. Innovators became self-conscious about the recog-
nition of the priority of their achievements with regard to
technological growth and the consequent material progress
realized by the social benefactors, mankind. For they felt
that this constituted their claim to fame and high esteem
in men's eyes. Also, much of the work of innovators was
associated with gainful professional work, especially in the
field of engineering. More recently research and develop-
ment, which includes all organized efforts to advance
technology, became a recognized duty in major universities.


that the rapid expansion of Modern Technology which
exists today began. For economic growth effectively closed
a loop forming an accelerating cycle where there had pre-
viously been a unidirectional path leading from technologi-
cal growth, which propelled Material Progress, to economic
growth, the realization of this progress.
For Material Progress is ultimately realized by its social
benefactor, mankind, via the economic system. It is through
the economic system that we realize increases of our mater-
ial 'standard of living,' theoretically increasing our measure
of happiness, or social welfare, according to the concept
behind an ideological element intrinsic to Modern Technolo-
gy, Material Progress. The instrument of Material Progress,
Modern Technology, provides, through its growth, impetus
for economic growth (for growth in Modern Technology
increases effectiveness in producing material objects and
thus increases productivity) and our subsequent material
'satisfaction.'
At the turn of the century the economic system, par-
ticularly in the western hemisphere, began providing return
stimulus in the form of material 'investment' back upon the
technology which propelled it, greatly accelerating the
growth of Modern Technology and consequentially giving
the economy net positive returns for its investment in the
form of increased productivity. A cycle providing the rapid
acceleration of material progress was thus generated, as
economic and technological growth could stimulate each
other to unprecedented heights.
The stimulation of technological growth by free enter-
prise economies is best exemplified by the advent of system-
atic industrial experimentation. In the mid 1800's there was
a certain amount of industrial research and development,
and a burst of important innovations contributed to
technology's advance in the second half of the century.
Yet the deliberate employment of investigators to create
or refine the technology of production and increase material
productivity was considerably delayed in arriving. In the
United States the first private industrial laboratory was not
built until 1900 by the General Electric Company, and
organized research and development on a large scale did not
really get under way until 1913.7 Only then did companies
recognize the potential profitability of in-house research
activities for the advancement of technology. The resulting
large scale industrial R&amp;D constituted a significant de-'
parture from the earlier era of Modern Technology, where
technological growth was primarily the result of indepen-
dent innovators who often had very limited resources and
funding.
During the twentieth century, the number of industrial
laboratories grew by leaps and bounds. By World War 1
there were around 100 industrial laboratories in the United
States. The number increased greatly during World War II,
and by 1960 there were more than 5400 major industrial
labs.8 Since World War II the prevalent idea has been that
investment in R &amp; D is essential to corporate growth.
Today the fervor for material progress is greater than
ever, and so, consequently, tremendous emphasis is placed
by society upon the growth of Modern Technology, the
instrument whereby material progress proceeds. The pres-
sure for technological growth is most readily revealed
by the process through which material progress is ultimately
realized by society, the economic system.
There is scarcely a corporate report to stockholders or a
major speech by a corporate executive which does not make
favorable reference to the twin ideas of research and
growth. At the government level constant emphasis
is placed on increasing the Gross National Product (GNP).
With the establishment of the National Economic Develop-
ment Council in 1962 economic growth has become an
official feature of the Establishment. Thus pressure for tech-
nological growth by the strong emphasis on rapid economic
growth is very evident in all segments of today's society.
The ideological sphere of Modern Technology within the
context of today's society has been characterized with the
growth of Modern Technology to the present discussed.
Thus some conclusions can be arrived at with considerable
confidence concerning the prospects for growth of Modern
Technology in the absence of economic growth. The super-
ficial interrelationship between technological growth and
economic growth involving their reciprocating stimuli
is quite complex, but when the intrinsic characteristics
of Modern Technology are noted, specifically the elements
of its ideological sphere, conclusions are forthcoming.
The concept of economic growth, which is accomplished
through increased efficiency of production provided by
Modern Technology, is rooted in the idea of Material
Progress: The continual fulfillment of certain perceived
material needs in our quest of social welfare. It readily
follows that if there is no economic growth, there cannot
be Material Progress, for continued fulfillment of our
material 'needs' exemplified by increased 'standards of
living' and perceived as being essential to our happiness
requires further economic growth and thus cannot occur.
Since Modern Technology is the instrument of Material
Progress through its growth, and a crucial element in
its intrinsic ideological sphere is the idea of Material
Progress, it follows that without Material Progress not
only is there zero growth in Modern Technology, there

zero economic growth necessitates zero growth in Modern
Technology. If one factor subsequent to modern man's
primary pursuit is zero, all must be zero, for all factors
are interdependent:
B. New Prospects
The actual prospects for growth in Modern Technology
are less readily discernible for we are confronted with
a much more difficult problem than that generated
by the assumption of zero economic growth. For here
we are concerned with the future possibility of zero
economic growth, or more generally, the possibility of
zero Material Progress. With the present ideology held by
man of material progress for the realization of happiness
and social welfare, zero Material Progress will occur if:
1) Man achieves total material satisfaction (which
does not necessarily imply he has reached a
state of well-being).
2) Material Progress reaches some maximum con-
straining limit.
3) Man decides material progress is futile and
proceeds along some other course of progress,
fulfilling perceived needs which are not material
in his quest for happiness.
In light of the conclusion arrived at in the analysis detailed
in the first part of this essay. Modern Technology will
become obsolete if any of these situations occur.
The first of these possibilities of zero Material Progress,
the achievement of total material satisfaction by man,
is discussed by a number of authors, notably economists.
Robert Heilbroner, at one point in his book. The Limits
of American Capitalism, concerns himself with the loss
of the 'traditional' stimuli of capitalism as material needs
diminish with their fulfillment. He states that, "(One
reason for) the erosion of the market ... is the effect
of technology in steadily raising the average level of
well-being, thereby gradually bringing to an end the
condition of material need as an effective stimulus for
human behavior."^ In order to alleviate possible false im-
pressions of the occurrence of 'ultimate' well-being through
total material satisfaction in this quote of Heilbroner,
it must be added that Heilbroner later states that poten-
tially 'higher' levels of well-being will still exist with the
cultivation and enrichment of all human beings, in all
their diversity, complexity, and profundity.10
Another economist which concerns himself with the
total material satisfaction of man is Jean Fourastie.
Like Heilbroner, Fourastie indicates higher levels of well-
being beyond that supplied by fulfillment of man's material
needs. According to Fourastie, however, intellectual, spir-
itual, and moral life will never mature except when life is
able to start from a complete satisfaction of its material
needs. He states that material progress occurs automati-
cally, and the inevitable role of (modern) technology is
the guaranteeing of such material development as allows
the intellectual and spiritual maturation of what has
been up to now only potentially present in human
nature.11 So both Heilbroner and Fourastie indicate
man's ultimate realization of fulfilled material needs
through Modern Technology, with potential levels of
well-being reaching higher heights with subsequent forms
of human cultivation and spiritual maturation.
With the fulfillment of man's material needs through
Modern Technology as prophesied by Heilbroner and
Fourastie, Material Progress will have realized its end.
For, although an 'ultimate' state of well-being would not
be attained, further progress would have to be non-
material by nature providing 'spiritual maturation'. Hence
the instrument of Material Progress, Modern Technology
with its ideological elements, would be essentially obsolete,
have performed its task.
If Heilbroner and Fourastie are correct regarding man's
eventual material gratification, a new instrument to propel
the new non-material 'spiritual' progress must come into
being to fulfill his perceived needs of further human
cultivation and enrichment in the quest for higher planes
of satisfaction. This new instrument will be intrinsically
different than that of Modern Technology's. For the
new concept of progress will be of one that is intellectual
and spiritual, not material.
The analysises of Heilbroner and Fourastie neglect
a crucial aspect of Modern Technology, however, which
will inhibit (or does inhibit) the realization of the ful-
fillment of our material needs. For Modern Technology
'desires' to sustain itself. This is accomplished through
what some critics call the 'tyranny of artificial needs',
material needs imposed on man and 'fulfilled' by Modern
Technology but which do not contribute to individual
well-being or to social welfare.
A great number of philosophers indicate that Modern
Technology is a 'creature' in itself. Jacques Ellul calls this
creature the 'technical milieu,' which has replaced the old
milieu, nature, and within which rests all social phenomena.
In his book. The Technological Society, Ellul says.
Technique has become autonomous; it has fa-
shioned an omnivorous world which obeys its own
laws and which has renounced all tradition ....
Technique has progressively mastered all the elements
of civilization .... man himself is overpowered by
technique and becomes its object."
Modern Technology, acting autonomously, insures its
survival. Through its growth it has instituted into society
material items which have become 'necessaries' for the mass
of the people. Such items include the telephone, the pri-
vate automobile, and the television set.
In free enterprise systems the economy effectively
generates artificial needs and impresses them upon people
through advertisements. Through advertising, entrepreneurs
hope to increase consumer demand by creating new desires
such that greater profits are realized. Advertising is thus an
attempt to increase the overall mass of desirousness by
artificial creation of desires in people for new things or for
more things.
Technological growth via technical innovation is essential
to corporate growth and is the principle means of corpor-
ate competition. Free enterprise competition requires
companies to innovate at an increasing rate if they are to
remain competitive. Thus the free enterprise economy
nurtures the creation of artificial needs by requiring
10


entrepreneurs also have an eye on the 'overnight fortune',
which is less likely to be made producing some staple item
then by inventing some 'gimmick', by discovering some new
'need', or by creating some fashion.
In the area of agriculture Modern Technology has
effectively driven off its chief 'competitor', nature. For by
increasing the 'efficiency' of soil fertility through inorganic
nitrogen fertilizers, the nitrogen fixing bacteria supplied
freely by nature are destroyed, requiring the continued use
of fertilizer.^ Likewise, insecticides destroy the freely
available natural predators of insects. Additionally, like an
addictive drug, fertilizer nitrogen and synthetic insecticides
literally create increased demand as they are used; the
buyer becomes hooked on the product. So it is apparent
that fertilizers and insecticides are artificial needs in the
truest (and most gruesome) sense.
In socialist economic systems the generation of artificial
needs is also prevalent because the obsession with economic
growth is global. The increase of material 'standards of
living' is the goal of every country, regardless of any actual
gratification realized by the citizens.
At the world level there is competition among nations
requiring technological growth. This competitive spirit
generates huge artificial material needs, needs which are
fulfilled by the economy's cohort. Modern Technology.
National defense and the 'balance of power' requirements,
as well as the space race, are excellent examples of this.
So it would appear that the perceived attainment of the
total material gratification of man is a rather remote
remote possibility in light of the continual generation of
artificial needs. It appears that Material Progress will con-
tinue infinitely, unless it reaches some maximum con-
straining limit. Barry Commoner, in his book, The Closing
Circle, deals with this ultimate limit, the exploitation capa-
city of the ecosphere.
Barry Commoner describes the vast detrimental effects
of ecologically defective Modern Technology. The detailed
accounts of pollution in our air, earth, and water leave
little doubt about the magnitude of the current crisis.
This crisis is the result of the element of Modern Technolo-
gy's ideology which complements the idea of Material
Progress: The idea of objectified nature, nature to be
conquered and controlled. Economic growth, the mani-
festation of Material Progress, depends upon the exploita-
tion of the earth's ecosystem via Modern Technology.
This exploitation must necessarily have an upper limit,
which Barry Commoner refers to as the reflection of the
intrinsic limit of the ecosystem's turnover rate. There is an
upper limit to the rate of exploitation of the biological
capital on which any productive system depends. Common-
er states.
Since the rate of use of this biological capital cannot
be exceeded without destroying it, it also follows that
the actual rate of use of total capital (ie., biological
capital plus conventional capital, or the means of
production) is also limited. Thus there must be some
limit to the growth of total capital, and the produc-
tive system must eventually reach a 'no-growth' con-
dition.^
Thus economic growth, as well as the material progress
which it represents, is intrinsically limited and a state of
zero growth is inevitable. For reasons discussed earlier,
Modern Technology will become obsolete when this in-
evitable 'no-growth' condition is attained.
Commoner condemns Modern Technology and em-
phatically states that all our (material) progress has
greatly increased the impact on the environment.'° He
later elaborates on the necessity of creating a new
ecologically sound technology. Growth in the new techno-
logy would result with facilities to return sewage and
garbage directly to the soil, as well as the creation of
effective biological pesticides, processes for the complete
recycling of glass, paper and metal, and methods for the
complete containment and reclamation of combustion
products. The new technology would, in effect, be a
return of man to nature. The ideological sphere surroun-
ding this new technology would treat nature as part of man,
treating it as subject and not object as does Modern
Technology. Furthermore, the concept of Progress would
have to be compatible with the inherent growth limitations
of the ecosphere which Commoner discusses. Material
Progress is incompatible, for this sort of progress can
only proceed up to the limiting material growth capacity
of the ecosphere, at which point it must cease or destroy
the system which supports it (and destroys itself). The
technology present then would be an instrument of an
alternative form of progress, non-material by nature.
Technology with an ideological sphere containing the
elements of non-material progress and the idea of nature
as subject, not treating man independent of his environ-
ment, I will call FUTURE TECHNOLOGY. Barry Common
er essentially states that the implementation of a FUTURE
TECHNOLOGY is ultimately manditory if human civili-
zation is to sustain its existence.
There are considerable arguments that man immediately
abandon as futile his quest for happiness through Material
Progress and its instrument. Modern Technology, rather
than waiting for its inevitable abandonment (which must
occur in light of the continual generation of artificial needs
within the context of the limited exploitation capacity of
the ecosystem). Such arguments were put forth as early
as the Eighteenth Century by men such as Jean-Jacques
Rousseau (1712-78), who represents the first revolt against
the ideology of Modern Technology. He effectively argued
that technology has imposed artificial needs on man, and
that the pursuit of these needs has deprived man of his
humanity. Artificial needs created by technology are
fundamentally impoverishing man's life. Rousseau's solu-
tion was the defiance of artificial needs and the return to
nature J 6 This solution is consistent with that posed by
the ideological sphere of FUTURE TECHNOLOGY.
A more recent critic for change, Henryk Skolimowski,
argues that we are "at the mercy of an increasing quantity
pf objects which saturate and atomise our human environ-
ment, which constantly require our attention, and which
condition us to new and artificial needs ..."'' He goes
on to say that (modern) technology was created to
gratify our genuine needs but that in reality needs are
artificially created to satisfy the demands of (modern)
1 1


ideology of Modern Technology consists of treating nature
as part of our outer skin which cannot be damaged without
causing damage to ourselves. A return to a religious
reverence of nature is suggested. This would render Modern
Technology harmless, useless as an instrument for the
exploitation of nature, and obsolete, useless as an instru-
ment for the attainment of well-being.
In conclusion we will look at one of the most outspoken
critics of the current drive for material progress. E.J. Mishan
in his book. The Costs of Economic Growth, argues very
convincingly that man's pursuit of happiness down the road
of economic growth is not only futile, but regressive. He
states that, "for today's generation in particular, it is a fact
of experience that within the span of a few years the
unlimited marketing of new technological products can
result in a cumulative reduction of the pleasure once freely
enjoyed by the citizen."^ ° He goes on to say that the social
process by which technological growth is accomodated is
almost certain to reduce our sources of gratification in life.
An alternative technology for a new Progress must be
forthcoming, now, if we are able to regain those lost sources
of gratification.

Ecologist,
In accord with Mishan's arguments and in parallel with
the rapid expansion of Modern Technology which exists
today (primarily resulting from the accelerating economic
investment stimulus elaborated upon earlier), it is becoming
all too apparent that the organized pursuit and realization
of modern technological growth themselves act to destroy
the chief ingredients that contribute to men's well-being.
What is the chief ingredient being destroyed? It is this
element which must be restored and enhanced by a
successful alternative nonmaterial 'spiritual' Progress in
man's ceaseless pursuit.
It was mentioned near the beginning of this paper
that man abandoned the religious structures which pro-
vided him avenues toward 'attained' happiness with the
advent of 'scientific thought'. The prevalent atheistic
attitude which resulted stripped man of the comfort of
his most cherished 'illusions', the love of God and the
assurance of eternal life. The consequential material pro-
gress since then has deprived us of a certain innate love
between one another, between us and God, channelling
us into a 'rat race'-putting our energies toward the
pursuit of material success, new knowledge, fashions, new
sensations-and leaving little to flow directly between
people; isolating us and stealing our ability to realize our
intrinsically compassionate beings only made possible by
communion with one another and God. It is evident that,
at least in this respect. Material Progress has not contributed
to our well-being but has stolen from it. Accordingly, it is
becoming increasingly obvious that an immediate return to
some form of spiritual progress is required, with the im-
plementation of a new instrument to carry out this
progress, a new technology, one bearing respect for nature
and providing avenues for spiritual growth and realization
of well-being, a true FUTURE TECHNOLOGY.
It seems that man has lost sight of something, something
very basic and intrinsic yet immaterial. Man must regain
his vision if he is to ever have any hope of achieving
true fulfillment and happiness. Maybe man should regress
for a moment, not 'progress', to rediscover that 'some-
thing' lost to Material Progress: Love, love for one
another, love for God. For love and happiness are in-
separable.

A BOOK REVIEW
by David Voss
In 1972 a book was published which described a
computer model of the world and stated that in 70
years the world system would collapse if nothing were
done about it. That book. Limits to Growth, evolved
out of a unique study made by Dennis Meadows of
Dartmouth and Jay Forrester of the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology. They constructed a computer model that,
when supplied with vital global statistics, would calculate
theoretical trends in population, natural resource usage,
industrial output and other parameters in a world system.
The MIT study was an important ground breaking step
in making the public aware of the finiteness of our planet.
In 1971 Meadows' findings were reported to the Club
of Rome, an international group of scientists, statesmen,
and educators who came together to discuss and evaluate
the situation of Mankind. In July, 1974 Mihajlo Mesarovic
of Case Western Reserve University and Eduard Pestel of
the Technical University at Hannover, Germany, presented
another study involving computer modelling to the Club
of Rome, which was distributed in North America in
early February of this year. This "Second Report" uses
a fundamentally different approach to modelling the
world system that does the Meadows Report, going
deeper into the political and social influences as well
as the economic factors which are determining the future
of our planet. As an attempt to expose more of the
engineering community to the implications of a finite world,
we will examine the Mesarovic- Pestal Report and compare
it to the earlier work of Meadows and Forrester.
Some background is necessary for those who haven't
already read Limits to Growth. One of the earliest
endeavors growing out of the early Club of Rome Meetings
was the Project on the Predicament of Mankind. In
these meetings Dr. Jay Forrester of MIT presented a
model of the world system based on interlocking relation-
ships and feedback loops that approximate the dynamics
of the real world. The computer model itself is a fascin-
ating piece of software engineering and much too complex
to go into at this writing, but Dr. Forrester has written
a number of books dealing with what he calls System
Dynamics and global modelling.^ "The basis of [System
Dynamics] is the recognition that the structure of any
system - the many circular, interlocking, some-times time-
delayed relationships among its components - is often
just as important in determining its behavior as the
individual components themselves."
In Limits to Growth twelve different scenarios are
analyzed, ranging from a view of the effects of historical
trends on the future, to a world in which population and
capital growth are regulated. In the first scenario, for
example, no changes are assumed in the "physical, econom-
ic, or social relationships that have historically governed
the development of the world system." * As one can see
in fig. 1, the prospects seem pretty grim; the level of natural
resources declines sharply around the year 2000 (model
time, i.e. the year for which these trends are calculated, run-
ning from 1900 to 2100). Food per capita and industrial
out put per capita reach a peak at about 2010 and drop
off quickly, with rising pollution levels following not
far behind. Population is the last to rise and fall due
primarily to the natural delays in the world system and
the high death rates following severs food shortages.

Presumably, the flexibility of the model allows the
programmer to vary such things as population levels,
pollution and industrial output. In another scenario it
is assumed that the planet has "unlimited resources,"
(i.e. resources are fully exploited and 75% of those
used are recycled), pollution controls, increased agricul-
tural output, and "perfect" birth control (more effective
methods are made available to more people). One might
think that this would do just the thing for our ailing
world, but rather, it only treats the symptoms, it really
doesn't attack the problem. Fig. 2 shows how the world

reacts to these primarily technological measures. During
a period of apparent prosperity the levels of food produc-
tion and industrial out-put shoot off the computer graph
while population remains relatively stable. At 2030, how-
ever, the pollution becomes too much for the controls
to handle and the trace shoots up sharply, followed
by plummeting food production levels and a downturn
in the population growth rate. In every scenario where
only technological "improvements" were made this "over-
shoot and collapse syndrome persisted.
In the most important computer run the only changes
made were in stabilizing population and capital growth.
No methods were suggested in the Meadows study for
establishing these policies, but they are interesting hypoth-
eses nonetheless. Population might be stabilized through
strict birth control or taxation, and capital growth by
equating capital investment to capital depreciation. The
results of this scenario are shown in fig. 3. There is
o

quite a long period of stability before the population
and food levels begin to decline, and this only because
of the gradual depletion of resources. A scenario incor-
porating all of the technological changes, pollution control,
recycling, increased agricultural productivity, and more
efficient use of capital, seems to remain stable indefinitely
(fig 4). This is a nice situation but it would take a lot of
motivation to achieve it in the real world. The most
disturbing aspect of these analyses is that the changes
are supposed to have been instituted by 1985, and after
delaying the changes until 2000, the report tells us,
the overshoot and collapse syndrome reappears.
The Meadows Report seems to be an indicator of the
clear and present danger in our future; what, then,
is the need for a Second Report to the Club of Rome?

mental attempt to model the complex world system.
And as in many experiments it is the duty of succeeding
research to improve upon the methodology of its pre-
decessors. This is the tack taken by Mihajlo Mesarovic and
Eduard Pestal in their book Mankind at the Turning
Point.
While it would be impossible to adequately document
the Mesarovic-Pestal model in these pages, we can look
at it briefly and compare it to the Forrester model.
To give some idea of the complexity of the new approach,
the Forrester model was based on some one hundred
interlocking relationships, whereas the new one contains
upwards of 100,000. A major innovation allowed in
a model of such detail comes in the programmer-computer
relationships. A user of the Forrester model is mostly a
passive observer: once all of the initial parameters are
set, the operator sits back and watches the computer
crank out trends in world development. To modify
the trends the programmer sets new initial conditions
and puts the machine back to work. In the more detailed
global model, the computer can respond to changes
as the computer is running. In this interactive mode the user
can alter the behavior of the system when he sees
that a change should be made, rather than wait until
the computer is finished printing out 200 years of trends.
Making faint references to the Meadows research the
authors say, "Our approach is not based solely on a
numerical representation of the system nor on an optimi-
zation algorithm for narrowly defined criteria. Rather, it
includes qualitative and logic-type relationships appro-
priate, and also relies on the heuristic or interactive
approach to decision making..."
Mesarovic and Pestal discard entirely the notion of
"monolithic" world development. In the Meadows study
the Earth is supposed to be a homogeneous organism,
having uniform birth and death rates, industrial output

and pollution generation. The Second Report suggests
that this is far from a realistic conception of a dynamic
global system. Instead the world is divided iinto ten
regions: 1. North America, 2. Western Europe, 3. Japan,
4. Australia, South America, and the rest of the "market
economy developed world," 5. Eastern Europe and the
Soviet Union, 6. Latin America, 7. North Africa and the
Middle East, 8. Tropical Africa, 9. South and Southeast
Asia, and 10. China. These regions were chosen on the
basis of ". ... shared tradition, history and style of life,
the stage of economic development, socio-political arrange-
ments, and the commonality of major problems . .."
There is a great deal of flexibility in this method, since
regions can be further subdivided into "member" countries
in order to consider specific problems, or grouped into
larger units for still other situations.
So much for the methodology of the report; what
did it come up with? In their problem statement the authors
suggest that the question is not one of growth or no-
growth, but whether we should have organic growth or
undifferentiated growth; the book uses cell division to
illustrate their point. In undifferentiated growth each cell
splits into two replicas of itself, the growth being in
number only. The number of cells turns out to be an
exponential function of time, and the cell system grows
rapidly, usually until the food supply runs out. In organic
or differentiated growth the cells form separate groups
that become the larger organs of the system, each having
a special function. While the growth, say, of a human,
reaches an equilibrium level, the organism continues to
change, new cells replacing old. "It is [a] pattern of

industrial and the developing or underdeveloped regions.
Their first scenario assumed that no changes in the
historical trends take place, but that population control
policies have been effective. Fig. 5 shows annual per capita
income ($US) plotted against computer model year. The
next three scenarios show the effect of delay on the
amount of foreign aid that would have to be given by
the developed countries (regions 1,2,3, and 4) in order
p
to significantly close the gap (a 5 to 1 reduction).
In scenario 2 aid is given continuously for 50 years,
reaching about $500 billion annually in 2025. In scenario 3
this aid is not started until 2000, and fig. 6 shows the net
effect; the total annual aid would have to surpass $1000
billion. In the fourth scenario an increased amount of aid
is transferred until 2000 when the gap is reduced 5 to 1.
The advantage of giving an increased amount of aid
early is evident: the total cost of aid in the early
action scenario is about $2500 billion as opposed to
$10,700 billion for the late scenario.9
Another problem to which the book addressed itself is
the consumption of natural resources. To analyze this,
the authors have chosen to model the world oil situation
as a representative case. The analysis was divided into
two parts: first, determine the "optimal" price level for
oil from the point of view of the Middle East; then,
apply this optimal price level to world development.
Gross regional product as a function of oil price is shown
in fig. 7. One might think that the best price for the
Mid East would be "all that traffic will bear," but in a more
comprehensive analysis factors such as resource limitations
substitutions, and changes in technology begin to affect the
unbalanced and undifferentiated growth which is at the
heart of the most urgent problems facing humanity."
While this is an extremely broad generalization, it does
offer something new.
The authors tried to answer some basic questions in the
context of organic growth: Are the crises (food, energy,
resources) that undifferentiated growth leads to per-
sistent, or are they just fluctuations due to neglect?
Can the crisis be solved by each nation separately, or
is a global solution necessary? How far reaching must
the solutions be? Will delay help or hurt the solution?
To guage the persistency of these crises Mesarovic and
Pestal analysed the growing economic gap between the

optimal price range. In the second part of the analysis,
a comparison is made of development in the four major
region groups where the price of oil is fixed, and where it
is optimal (fig. 8). It is apparent that all nations are
benefitting from optimal pricing, which tends to point
out that co-operation rather than retaliation is in everyone's
best interest.
This is only about half of the book. Other studies in-
clude population trends, the food situation, and the effect of
technology on world development. It is unfortunate that
a complete review is not possible because this is indeed a
fascinating study. But even though the authors claim that
this is not a series of predictions of the future, the report
does have some elements of forecasting to it. As such, and
as with any other computer modelling scheme, the con-
clusions presented must be examined very carefully. It
is only by looking into the future that we can plan for it.

L. J. Quackenbush
by Steve Haynack
Looking dapper in his neatly trimmed beard and
light checkered sport coat, Professor Leland J. Quackenbush
entered the luxurious Technic office to be the subject
of this issue's Teacher Feature.
This well-dressed professor, it was revealed later, had
"made in Michigan" imprinted all over him. He was born
in Jackson, Michigan, entered University of Michigan
as a twenty-two year old freshman in 1942, married
a Michigan girl after he graduated in 1945, has made
his home in Ann Arbor, and two of his three children
are now doing graduate work here at U of M.
Professor Quackenbush is one of the more student-
oriented professors in the College of Engineering. He
is the faculty adviser to the Vulcans, to the Pi Tau Sigma
Mechanical Engineering Honor Society, and he is also
the program advisor to undergraduates in mechanical
engineering.
The Vulcans, founded in 1904, are the senior men's
engineering honor society. During the more active years,
the Vulcans have been involved in fund-raising for de-
serving causes. They have sponsored concerts, dances and
films to finance lectures, banquets and a loan fund.
In recent years, the Vulcans have been selling the Engineer-
ing Class Rings, and the revenues go to a scholarship
and loan fund. Professor Quackenbush emphasizes that
the Vulcans are entirely a student-run organization, his
role being purely advisory.
Prof. Quackenbush is also the faculty adviser to the
sponsors of the "egg drop" and "beer can energy"
contests Pi Tau Sigma, the mechanical engineering
honor society. As of this date, the type of contest to be
held is up in the air. Again, Prof. Quackenbush's function
is to officiate the contest and be an adviser. Whatever
the contest, students always rush to compete for the
popular alcoholic first prize.
However, being a program adviser to the M.E. under-
grads is what occupies most of his non-class time. Prof.
Quackenbush notes that what he usually hears most from
students is their gripes about all of the prerequisites
they have to take; "Do I really have to take this course?".
Without being negative on the subject. Prof. Quackenbush
sumpathizes with the student, answering, "you've got to
have the background to be able to take higher level courses"
the usual reply. But Prof. Quackenbush goes a
step further. He believes that an engineering education,
stressing the problem-solving approach and developing
a feeling for finding solutions, is an excellent back-
ground for any career.
Prof. Quackenbush speaks from personal experience
in this matter. As a high school student, he did fairly
well in math and the physical sciences. He came to
Michigan and, after four years of an engineering education,
went into industry. After a short stint on the company's
drafting boards, he went into "traditional" design work.
He came back to U of M for his master's degree in 1947-48
and then left for industry again. With a little more
20


in manufacturing processes (he now teaches a course,
M.E. 381, of the same name) as the liasion engineer between
the production and design departments. However, after
seven years in manufacturing. Prof. Quackenbush decided
that being in management was not what he really wanted
to do, so he came back to teach.
In each case, his education gave him a broad enough
background to enable him to switch jobs without being
underqualified.
Today's graduating engineers, Prof. Quackenbush notes
have increased awareness of society and the role they
will play in it. He feels that students are beyond "what
is good for the company is good for the country". They
should look toward what they can accomplish with the
company.
Perhaps, Prof. Quackenbush observes, the basic quality
of the University is changing changing for the better.
The freshman students are coming into the University en-
vironment better prepared, having more extensive pre-
paration in math and science. "They seem better able to
cope with life at the U of M than in my day."
The faculty has remained, more or less, statis, but
still responsive to the inquiring minds of the students.
Prof. Quackenbush sees the mechanical engineers' in-
fluence of the future of industry directed towards a more
direct numerical control over processing and manufactur-
ing. That is, trained computer specialists operating the
factories. This results in a de-emphasis on manual control
of machines.
As an example. Prof. Quackenbush cites the designing
process of the automobile. Before the advent of the
computer, models were constructed, calculations compiled,
and many decisions made all in all, a time consuming
process compared to today's methods. In designing a pro-
totype car, the modern engineer merely chooses a design
pattern in the computer, and is given a whole range of
figures immediately to consult, including the cost of raw
materials, labor, instrumentation, and safety character-
istics. Then the real engineering can begin. The fine-tuning
of the trade-offs, which are necessary to produce the final
product after a minimum of time and decisions, can then
begin.
In his spare time, Prof. Quackenbush and his wife like
to collect antiques, but the rarity of antiques here in
Michigan may take them south of the border.
Prof. Quackenbush concludes that a quality institution
of higher learning depends on the merits of the students,
faculties, and facilities. And the U of M's Engineering
College has emerged as one of the better institutions
in the country. People like Professor Quackenbush have
been instrumental in this rise.

by Jim Epperson
The day had not started out auspiciously. I had forgot-
ten to pack some things, and when I tried to stuff them in-
to my trunk, it wouldn't close. So, while Mother fidgeted
and looked insistently at the clock, I had to decide what
stayed and what went with me—a life and death decision,
you understand.
That crisis passed, we finally made it to the airport in
Hartford, where I kissed Mother good-bye and boarded
American Airlines flight 519, non-stop for Detroit. One
hour and twenty minutes later, I stood in the terminal
building at Metro, amid a pile of two suitcases, a gymbag,
one trunk, and assorted books (which collection rep-
resented all my worldly belongings), and said to myself,
"What the hell do I do now?"
Fortunately, I had been to Detroit once before, so I
almost knew what I was doing. The limousine ticket was
$4.50 in those days, and I soberly shelled it out, won-
dering how the Dickens I would get my stuff from the
Union to Bursley Hall.
"How long till the driver leaves for Ann Arbor?" I in-
quired.
"Oh, should be about twenty minutes or so," was the
reply.
So I waited outside...and waited...and then waited some
more. Twentv minutes was fast approaching an hour, and
21


was at 3:00, and it was already 11: 30. Figure an hour to get
to Ann Arbor, an hour to get squared away in my room, an
hour for lunch, and that's 2:30 already!
I soon discovered what the problem was. Seems that
one of the Metro drivers had decided to take an unan-
nounced, unscheduled day off, leaving me (among others)
in the lurch. However, I was able to team up with three
young ladies who were all Ann Arbor-bound, and we split
the cab fare four ways, which actually came to less than
$4.50. Still, despite its inflation-fighting characteristics,
this plan did have some drawbacks.
"OK, where're you all headed in Ann Arbor?"
"The girls are all going to the Union. I'm going to Burs-
ley Hall."
"The Union, huh? That's fine. Where was it you're
going, son?"
"Bursley Hall."
"Where's that?"
"North Campus."
"Where's that?"
"Uh, ..."
After a classic exercise in a sightless man leading one
who cannot see, we finally arrived at the back of Bursley
Hall, by the bus-stop, where I and my luggage were de-
posited to fend for ourselves. I think the luggage could've
managed better by itself.
I immediately took stock of the situation. It was a
warm September day. I was wearing my (one and only)
sport coat, my trenchcoat (it wouldn't fit in the trunk),
and a long-sleeved shirt. First observation: I was
sweating to death. Second observation:
'Where the hell am I?'
•-•• .
Trusting that no one would try to walk off with my
trunk (who wants a free hernia?), I took up my suitcases
and gymbag, and struggled to the nearest visible door.
After being carried down a flight of stairs by the luggage,
I found myself in a wide open expanse which apparently
was the main lobby. I walked over to the desk, grand-
iosely announced my arrival and asked what happened
next. I was not left wondering for long.
"Bartlett House, eh? That's West Side. Go thataway
through those doors into the tunnel then up the stairs to
your left no right up to the lounge and you can't miss
it's where you check in!"
Right)
Aiming myself "thataway", I picked up my cargo and
headed out. After several wrong turns and missed turns,
I mounted the top of some stairs to see a smiling R.A.
sitting behind a table.
"Welcome to East Lansing, Michigan, home of the Mich-
igan State Spartans! Go Green!"
I could've shot him.
After convincing Smiley that I knew where I was (a
matter of some debate), I got my room key and directions,
along with the other inevitable paraphenalia that goes along
with dorm check-in. After a few more escapades in invol-
untary dorm exploration, I found myself staring at a green
door.
"7253— this is it. Wonder what my roommate will be
like? Probably some gargantuan linebacker who eats whole
sides of beef for dinner."
And I was a I30-pound weakling—which was better than
my roommate, who turned out to be a 120-pound weakling
with the deadliest pool cue this side of Minnesota. Rack
'em up, Willie!
But he wasn't in yet, so I simply deposited my suitcases,
etc., on the floor and collapsed onto the bare mattress. I
was about to fall blessedly asleep when my trunk reached
out from the back of my mind and said, "Hey, stupid! I'm
still down here by the bus-stop!"
So, I completely retraced my steps—down stairs to
where Smiley still beamed from behind the table, down
some more stairs to the main desk, then up a flight of
stairs outside to the bus-stop. I picked up my trunk-
or tried to, to be more precise—and lugged it about three
feet before I had to put it down. I looked around me,
but couldn't find anyone to help, so I tried again. I man-
aged, after considerable toil and trouble, to manhandle
the thing up to my room via the stairs (one of Burs-
ley's wonderful features is the Bartlett elevator—it has a
distribution function with a mean value of "out of order"
and a standard deviation of "always."). I would've
collapsed again, except that my watch read 1:30. I had
to find some lunch and then get to Hill Auditorium for
orientation. The cafeteria was not yet serving, so my op-
tions for lunch were rather low. Fortunately, one of the
myriad forms that I now possessed gave the location of
both a candy machine and a Coke machine. Well, it may
not be filet mignon, but it would do.
Half an hour and $1.50 later, I staggered away from the
enemy into my room, soundly beaten in what was to go
down in history as the First Battle of the Vending
Machines. For my time and labor, not to mention money,
I feasted upon one package of stale Lorna Doones and a
warm Coke!
I was beginning to wish I had gone to Rensselaer.

This month we take a look at the war-torn years be-
tween 1940 and 1945. For most American students, this
was a time of victory gardens, war bonds, and-possibly-
a time for leaving school to go fight. In the early Forties
students were wondering if college was worth continuing.
The following passage from a 1941 Technic sums up this
feeling: "War!! up until a week and a half ago war was
something in a distant land...Some students have expressed
the sentiment that there is no point in going on with their
studies. 'After all, we only get our brains blown out...'"
This issue of the Technic appeared just after Pearl Harbor.
As the United States became more involved with what
was going on "over there," engineering students at Michigan
were faced with the possibility of going to war. Unlike the
recent Vietnam tragedy, the agony of the decision did not
so much revolve around the morality of war, but rather,
how best to help the war effort. After all, engineers had
technical skills that were needed elsewhere; the homefront
was already feeling the pinch in the way of trained tech-
nical people. The Technic finally took a stand on whether
or not students should continue their studies or quit school
to fight. In a 1943 editorial, it was stated that some upper-
classmen could receive a deferment and remain in school;
unfortunately, the local draft boards were never able to
clarify an individual's status properly—hence making it nigh
impossible for the student to plan for his future. The
Technic encouraged students to stay in school as long as
Possible, and hence the College became the target of much
criticism because of this stay-in-school attitude. But, the
editorial went on to say "we are conscientiously deter-
mined to see this war through to an eternal peace, and to
this end we will give unstintingly of ourselves, our time, and
our talents, whether it be on the battlefront, or the home-
front."
Wartime Technics had a look all their own, and war-
related articles such as "Revolution in Artillery," "The
World's Largest Bomber Plant," and "Broaching Pigling
in Gun Barrels" were common. An article in the January
1943 Technic called "Engineers at War" points out that
the engineer is instrumental to the war effort both on the
battlefield and in using the sliderule.
Even our advertising had a distinctive flavor during the
war years. When the war started, virtually every national
advertiser switched the emphasis on his ads from simple
engineering to the war effort. One example of this is a
series of Timken ads run between 1940 and 1945. Prior
to the outbreak of the war, it reads like any other ad in the
Technic. But in March, 1942 issue, the ad reads, "Timken
bearings are keeping the wheels and shafts turning for vic-
tory. They'll keep them turning for prosperity afterwards."
Also: "Better lungs for America's fighter planes," from
Westinghouse, complete with artwork showing a Japanese
fighter being shot down by an Air Corps plane. This
wartime "victory" attitude was carried on down the line
by the majority of Technic's advertisers.
The war had many effects on University life and the
Michigan Technic. ROTC returned to campus, to turn out
officers for the Army and Navy. And even the Technic
joke column was affected, as it turned out nothing but
war-related humor, although the military content of this
gem has not yet been ascertained: "Extra: Local yokel
makes good. He is happy. Miss Good could not be reached
for comment."
To sum it up, we can say that good prevailed over evil,
peace prevailed over war, and the Michigan Technic pre-
vailed over the Michigan Daily. Hopefully, we won't ever
see a wartime Technic again.

engineers who think
like Thomas Edison.
Ever since Thomas Edison helped O O
start our business, GE has been known as an innovator.
Today, more than ever, we need original thinkers to
help keep that kind of thinking going. Not only
engineers who can invent products. Just as impor-
tant, engineers who can help find better ways to
design them, manufacture them, market and
service them.
With so many problems today in areas like
energy, the environment, and productivity, the
challenges to technology have rarely been greater.
And few companies can offer you more ways to
help solve these problems than General Electric.
At GE you might go to work on nuclear
power plants. Or more efficient fossil-fuel plants.
Or maybe one day work on one of the de-
veloping energy technologies like the fast-
breeder reactor. Coal gasification. Solar heating.
Battery storage for peaking power. Laser appli-
cations for fusion and fuel enrichment.
Or you might help build better mass-transit
systems. Pollution controls. Or cleaner, quieter jet
engines.
Or perhaps work on sophisticated medical devices
like GE's heart Pacemaker. Or engineering
plastics like our virtually unbreakable Lexan" resin. GE is
big in lots of areas you might not have known about.
But a word about that word "big." Some people worry
that General Electric might be too big for them.
Actually we're not like some big companies. We're decen-
tralized. Into strategic business units. Each with its own
plans and business objectives.
The whole idea is to give everyone plenty of responsibility
and plenty of room to try new ideas. And when you look at our reco
of innovation and growth, you can see that it works.

doesn't have to become a nightmare.
There could be as many as
20 million of them out there.
They lie rusting on streets
and countryside like a pox on
the American landscape.
Although they're 85% re-
usable metal, they've piled
up for years.
Why? Simple economics:
It often cost more to transport
and process a hulk than it was
worth.
But now, junked cars are
moving faster than ever.
Higher demand for steel and
growing concern for conser-
vation have made steel scrap
look better and better.
Helping tip the scales is
something Union Carbide
helped develop: the ultra
high-power electric furnace.
It can make new steel
using 100% scrap. It's cleaner
than other furnaces and it
uses less energy.
It's also relatively small, so
it may be located economi-
cally near the source of scrap,
reducing transportation costs.
Union Carbide created the
electrode that makes possible
this versatile furnace.
It's only one of our many
contributions to the steel
industry.
But it's helping the coun-
try get rid of a nightmare.

FMC's business is machinery and chemicals, a
combination which gives the company two billion
dollarsannual sales. And an unusual depth of capa-
bilities in such fields as energy, food production,
municipal services, construction, materials han-
dling, and transportation.
This wide variety of opportunities generates a
need for an equally broad variety of professional
skills, from business administration to major fields
of engineering. Here are three examples:
Chemicals
FMC is a major producer
of industrial chemicals, agri-
cultural chemicals, packaging
film and man-made fibers,
which, together, account
for approximately 50%
of the company's
dollar volume.
An illustration of
how FMC's chemical
and machinery
capabilities work in
combination is
agriculture. FMC
designs and builds
automatic equip-
ment for cultivating,
planting, and
harvesting, manufac-
tures chemicals to
protect the crops, and mechanized sprayers to ap-
ply the chemicals, and packaging films to protect
the products.
FMC has developed numerous proprietary
chemical products, such as
Furadanf an insecticide which
is improving yields of many
basic crops throughout
the world.
Energy
With the intensifying
; effort to recover
more of the world's
petroleum reserves,
there is growing
demand for a broad
line of petroleum
specialtyequipmentwhich FMCdesignsand manu-
factures. The products range from wellhead flow
controls, swivel joints, and valves to mechanized
loading systems and ocean-going vessels.
FMC also designs and builds equip-
ment to mine and process coal, the world's/!
most abundant reserve of energy fuel.
Environment
Throughout the world there are
urgent problems of urban decay,
overcrowding, pollution, the
shrinkage of open space.
FMC designs and builds
construction equipment for
builders and re-builders of
cities; treatment systems for
sewage, wastewater, and
industrial wastes; outdoor
power equipment and
chemicals for the
maintenance of recreation
areas; mechanical
sweepers to maintain
streets, airports, and
parking lots; even
fire-fighting g_
apparatus.
The opportunities
These examples suggest some of the varied
opportunities this company offers for self-realization
and self-achievement.
FMC is solid, successful, and has been profit-
able throughout the 47 years of its corporate history.
Because it is involved in growth markets, it provides
many opportunities for its people to grow with it in
their individual capacities.
And to contribute solutions to some of the most
urgent problems of our time.
If this sounds like the kind of work life you could
enjoy, see the FMC representative on campus, or
write for further information.

craze of the last few years is no longer just a "craze",
though, what with the rising cost of fuel, and air
pollution from auto emissions. Tom Baines, a graduate
student in I. &amp; O.E., contributes this month with a
cost-effectiveness analysis of the bicycle as competition
for the automobile in an urban setting. This is the
sixth and last installment in our series on the engineer
and his environment.
Outgoing Editor Jim Epperson contributes an article
on the history of the calculus as his last piece before
retiring to the real world. Jim's interest in the history
of math started with a course in it last year, and we
thought that the students might like to know where
those damn equations came from. If the response is
favorable, we may do another article in the fall, especially
since Jim couldn't cover all that he wanted to in the time
and space allowed.
Last month we printed the winning essay in the 1974
Cooley Essay contest. This month, we publish some of the
winners from the 1975 Cooley. Usually, we go to print
before the judges are finished, but they were pretty
quick this year, so we were able to slip in a short story
and excerpts from a poetry collection. The short story,
My Abuelo, was submitted under the pen name Otomi
Chixoy, and won Second Prize in the contest. The poems,
part of a collection titled Blast Off!, were written by
John Darango, a senior in Computer Engineering,
who won both Third Prizes with his poetry and a full
three-act play.
Retiring Prof. Streeter of Applied Mechanics is the
subject of this month's Teacher Feature, written by a
former student of his, Mary Goodreau, who also is re-
tiring, as our Business Manager. Prof. Streeter is well
known in his field of fluid mechanics, and, as Mary's article
shows, retirement does not mean he intends to stop working.
Finally, Ray Berry, who takes over as Business Manager,
tells about Marion Sarah Parker, the first woman graduate
from the College of Engineering, in his effort at "The
Good Old Days."

Sometimes I wonder about the education we are
getting in the College. Sometimes I wonder if I've been
shelling out my kilobucks for an education—or training.
Now what's the difference, you ask? Am I splitting hairs?
I don't think so.
Webster defines educate thusly: "to develop morally
and mentally," he defines train with: "to form by
instruction, discipline, or drill ... to teach so as to be
fitted, qualified, or proficient." I see the training in my
four years here, but I am hard pressed to find the
education. Most of our courses are cookbook methodology
—how to deal with certain engineering problems. Un-
fortunately, life presents us with more than just "engin-
eering problems," and unless you decide to stick your
head into the technological sand and ignore the world,
someday a non-engineering problem is going to knock
your socks off.
What is missing from the College is the true spirit of
education, of learning for learning's sake. Instead we have
a mad rush to fill departmental requirements, then full
speed ahead into our specialty. The Humanities require-
ments are brushed aside quickly, with easy courses that
say nothing (and hence mean nothing). "Why should I take
this course? What good does it do me?" Does every course
have to teach you how to build the better mousetrap?
What am I suggesting? Here we are, in the midst of one
of the best state universities in the country—use it! There
is an entire community of learning out there, and we are
isolating ourselves from it daily. Oh, I know, engineers don't
exist to the rest of this university. Maybe if we went
further west than West Engin they might discover us again.
The College doesn't make it easy, though. Most pro-
fessors and counselors act as though their courses were the
only ones that you were taking or could take. "Why
should you take that course? What good is it?" (Seems
I've heard that line before.) Nor are they notoriously
friendly to extra-curricular activities—inside or outside
the College. "Professor, I've been really busy lately with
E.I.1.1.—can I hand in that homework late?" I doubt it.
If you want to be a narrow-minded, calculator-toting
numbers jock, if all you came here for was a training,
then fine. But if you came here because the university is
supposed to educate you, open your eyes a little. You mighl
like what you see.
OOPS!
Due to error on our part, a portion of last month's
editorial was not printed correctly, resulting in some
inevitable distortion of our meaning. To correct this error,
we reprint the following lines from the first paragraph.
The italicized parts were omitted in the original:
"Engineering Council has often prided itself for its clean
record. Except for last year, when Bob Mathews tried to
usurp the presidency by suit, they have succeeded in
avoiding any scandals like those that envelop SGC."
The Technic is sincerely sorry that this error took place.
We apologize to anyone affected.

In the United States, a fourth of all the energy is devo-
ted to transportation, and of that fraction close to sixty
percent is supplied in the form of gasoline to roughly
100 million automobiles and small personal trucks. [1 ] The
combination of depleting oil supplies, increasing oil costs
and concern for environmental impacts of oil production
and the automobile suggests the need to improve the
energy performance of automobiles. One possibility for this
improvement is not to use automobiles at all, but use
bicycles instead for all short urban trips. There would be
many benefits associated with such a change, benefits such
as a reduction in urban air pollution, improved health
of the cyclist and less energy expended. Just how much
energy could be saved is the subject of the following
investigation.
Figure 1 and Table 1 present a total energy use esti-
mates per mile of bicycling. These numbers are derived
by first estimating dollar costs for bicycles, repairs,
maintenance, tires and bikeways—all on a bicycle-mile
(passenger-mile, PM) basis. These dollar costs are then
multiplied by appropriate energy coefficients obtained from
reference 2.
The incremental human energy required for bicycling
[3] at 10mph is about 110 Btu/mile. This is the energy
consumed in addition to that required for sedentary
actwffies such as sitting, standing or driving a c3
1500 Btu/hr- 400 Btu/hr

In order to develop this human energy output, the
cyclist consumes additional food. In 1971, about 7.2 Btu
of primary energy (coal, oil, natural gas, falling water,
uranium) were consumed to grow, process, transport, sell
and prepare each Btu of food in the U.S. [4]. Therefore,

and a moderately priced 10-speed. About 60% of the
purchaser's price for a new bicycle is due to manufac-
turing costs with 40% going for transportation, whole-
saling, and retail trade [6]. The bicycle cost is based on a
10-year life time for bicycles (not necessarily with the
same owner) and 1,500 miles of riding per year, assuming
a 4-mile trip to work for 30 weeks/year plus 300 miles of
recreational and miscellaneous riding annually.
Bicycle repair and maintenance costs are taken as
$5/year. These figures assume that the owner does minor
repairs and that an adequate system of bikeways is
available. Currently, cyclists must often ride in the street
gutter where glass and trash collect which increases main-
tenance, repair, and tire costs.
Bikeway construction is estimated to cost $25,000/
mile for a two-lane bikeway [7]. Bikeway lifetime is
taken at 20 years. The capacity for a two-lane bikeway
is calculated to be 5900 bicycles/hr. This assumes that the
moving cyclist requires an area 4 ft. wide by about 18 ft.
long. (6 ft. for the bicycle plus 12 ft. headway). This
leads to a capacity of:
(5280 ft/mile) (4 ft/lane) R 1fJmi/nr =
(4x 18)ft2/bicycle
2930 bicycles/lane-hr
In order to estimate construction costs per mile of
bicycle travel, an average "use factor" (i.e., the fraction of
capacity actually used) is needed. Reference 6 develops a
use factor of 4.2% based on actual studies, weather con-
siderations and daylight hours. This then permits the cal-
culation of the cost of bikeways per mile of cycling as
follows:
$25.000/mile/20 years =
(5860 bicycles/hr) (0.042) (8760 hrs/yr)

Figure 2. Total energy requirements per PM for bicycles
and automobiles.
With these figures, an estimate of costs are made as
summarized in Table 1. The estimated bicycling cost is
2.6 cents/mile of which half goes for food. The energy
estimates are derived by multiplying the dollar costs by
energy coefficients obtained from reference 2. These co-
efficients are approximations and introduce an additional
source of potential error. The total energy use is then es-
timated (Table 1) at 1,300 Btu/mile. This is equivalent
to 100 miles/gallon gasoline for a motor vehicle.
Before dollar, energy and time tradeoff comparisons can
be made between bicycles and automobiles, the relevant
data on automobiles, must be reviewed. References 6 and 8
give energy requirements for automobiles under two driving
situations, general urban use and urban commuting. These
two driving situations were selected because they represent
the areas in which the bicycle becomes competitive. These
references analyze total energy use for urban automobiles
and consider energy costs associated with gasoline (con-
sumption, refining, transport and sale), lubricating oil, the
automobile itself (manufacturing, transport and sale), re-
pairs, maintenance, parts, tires, insurance, parking (plus
garaging and tolls) and taxes (highway construction). Con-
sidering these direct and indirect energy uses, urban driving
requires 19,000 Btu/vehicle-mile (VM).
In order to compare this energy expenditure with that of
a bicycle, several additional factors must be considered in-
cluding the average passenger occupancy and efficiencies
as a function of trip distance. This latter relationship is
shown in Figure 2. It will be noticed that urban commuting
is significantly more costly from an energy consumption
point-of-view than general urban vehicle use. This is be-
cause the occupancy is lower and all trips to work ar
back are assumed to be driven with cars started co
(choked vehicle operation consumes significantly mo
fuel).
Therefore, from Figure 2, total energy use for autom
bile trips less than or equal to 5 miles averages 11,2(
Btu/PM which makes the bicycle 13 times more energ
efficient.
So far as dollar is concerned, for trips of five miles i
less the typical urban automobile costs 7.2 cents/PM whi
is nearly triple the cost of bicycling. The urban commul
spends about 10 cents/PM for these trips which is almc
four times the cost of riding a bicycle.
These advantages are offset by problems associat
with the bicyclist's personal safety, bicycle security, &lt;
posure of cyclists to auto exhaust, inability to cai
heavy loads on bicycles, and the need for reasonably go
health to cycle. Also, bicycling instead of driving takes m
time. For trips shorter than one mile, the bicycle is fas
but as trip length increases, the temporal advantage
cars grows rapidly. However, the average time penalty I
trips less than five miles is only six minutes. If a trave
values his free time at more than $1.10/hr, then it m
not be in his self-interest to shift to bicycles. For co
muting trips, the break-even point is $1.70/hr.
However, money and time considerations do not 1
the whole story. In addition to energy efficiency m
tioned above, potential benefits of cycling include
duced urban parking problems, reduced air and no
pollution, improved health for cyclists, greater mobil
for cyclists and the possibility of combining recreatii
exercise and transportation in the same trip. All thii
considered, the bicycle appears to be a convenient, ener
efficient alternative to the automobile for short urban tri

I'd also say it's time to get with learning all the ways asphalt paving
can be used wisely, because asphalt pavement is an energy saver.
It's a money saver, too. Especially with stage construction. You
can design the asphalt pavement needed now for today's traffic,
and plan to add more pavement strength in stages as traffic vol-
umes and weights increase. Road upgrading's big now, too, for
economy reasons, and asphalt's the ideal material for road over-
laying, strengthening or widening. So it pays any civil engineerto
know all he can about what can be accomplished with asphalt
paving. That's what this free Library helps you do. What's more, I

My Abuelo
OtomiChixoy
The situation I have to cope with and the one I have
chosen to discuss is that of the not too far off death of my
abuelo. Abuelo, in Spanish, means grandfather. His name is
Ramon but as far back as I can remember I have always
called him Abuelito. This is a difficult topic for me to write
on as I feel that it is very personal and private but I have had
it on my mind for some time now and I feel that I should
let some of my thoughts come out.
My abuelo lives in the Rio Grande Valley in south Texas.
My abuelo says that long, long ago our ancestors used to
live in a place called Aztlan but that they moved south to
Anahual (the place by the waters). Anahual is now called
Mexico by other people. In Anahual our ancestors stopped
in two places, Tenoch Titian (Mexico City) and Oaxaca,
near Monte Alban. My abuelo says that about two genera-
tions ago the part of the family that lived near Tenoch
Titian had moved back north to Texas. The last move was
my father finally moving: all the way back north near
Detroit. My abuelo still knows many of the old legends and
old ways that his grandfather showed him when he was
young: his abuelo is the one who had moved north from
Tenochtitlan. My abuelo told me that many of the things
that he taught me were the same as the things that his
abuelo taught him. I'm sure that they are the same teachings
that my great-great-great-great grandfather recited when
his grandfather talked to him and tried to show him atx
the world we live in.
The way I got to know my abuelo is that every sumr
except for the last two, of my life I spent at his house in
Rio Grande Valley. The Rio Grande Valley is a pecul
place, or so it seemed to me at that young age. The a
that we were in might have been all palm trees and w
fruit trees with monkeys in them, almost like a chapan
The peculiar thing was that if we were to move abou
mile in any direction we might run into vastly differ
terrain. It seemed as though desert was all around us.
abuelo used to pick me up and set me on his horse, in fn
of him, and ride out in the country side. Sometimes
would be gone for days, when we got back though
mother used to be angry because we would sometimes j
leave without telling her, and all the time that we were gc
my abuelo would be telling me of the old ways and atx
life and the land. I guess in this way most of the ideas
life and its values were implanted in my head. I have I
feeling that this is the way my abuelo was taught al!
Being taught alone in the country is the old way. I'm goi
to teach my son and grandsons the things my abuelo taue
me. I feel that my relationship with my grandfather h
little closer than the relationships of my friends and th
grandfathers. Through my abuelo I feel that I have a dirt
10


this is more than most people can say.
When my abuelo and I were together he used to tell me
about his life, too. He used to say how content he was be-
cause he had lived long and had a large family and that they
had enough to eat. He used to tell me about the best job that
he had and when he talked of that I remember that his
whole face would kind of light up and he would smile the
rest of the day. In Texas there is a large ranch called the
King Ranch. My abuelo used to be one of the foreman for
the ranch and had some of the best times of his life there.
To me, as a child, I couldn't understand why, when he
talked of work he would smile and feel good. Not until
lately have I understood this: for my abuelo it was im-
portant to live, (some people would say a hard life but I'm
not sure that is the right word) a life that was busy and one
in which he worked close to the earth. My abuelo is a
simple man with simple needs. Now when he talks, he tells
of his life and how he is satisfied with what he did with it.
One of the most important things my abuelo feels is that a
man should think about whatever a man does with his life
and that he should feel satisfied with his actions when he
comes to the end of his life. This simple criterion is some-
thing I try to live by also. So now my abuelo knows he is old
and getting senile and that he won't live much longer. My
family knows that he feels that he should be allowed to die
soon because in his mind he has lived a good life and its al-
most at its end. He doesn't want to be a burden to the rest
of the family. He gets mad because he'll be talking to some-
one and then he stops in the middle of a sentence because
he forgets what he was talking about. He gets mad because
his body is no longer strong. He has lost control of his
bowels, and sometimes when he goes to church he'll be
walking and his legs will bucket under him and he can't get
up. The thing that hurts him the most is that sometimes
my grandmother (they will have been married for 50 years
this February), will be talking to him and he asks who she
is and then he remembers and cries because he loves her so
much and he knows that it hurts her to see him like this. My
abuelo feels that this part of his life is over and his family
knows that deep down he wants to die soon even if he
won't say it. My abuelo doesn't want to become a vegetable.
When I think of my abuelo my mind goes back to the
times when we were together in the desert, on horses, with
him telling me about things. I think; my abuelo knows
so much, he has seen and done so many things. Here I am
just starting my life. I wish that there was some way he
could have some of my youthfullness so that he could get
better, so that I could talk and ride with him again.My
abuelo knows so many of the old things that my great-
grandfather knew. I think: what a waste it is for him to
die without his passing on that knowledge. I remember one
time we were out riding near the Rio Grande and I was
walking my horse when I slipped on a rock and fell and cut
my leg. I was about to put some medicine and a bandage,
that I had in my bag, on the cut when my abuelo told me
not to. He pointed around to some plants that grew near
the river and said "When you see these plants near the water
YOU can take the mud from around them and put it on a cut
and the bleeding will stop and you won't have a scar after-
wards." It's so many little things like that that will die with
him. I think that both my abuelo and I feel that this is the
greatest sorrow for us because the last time I saw him he
asked me to help him walk down by the river because he
wanted to tell me two things. The point of that walk was
that he asked me to remember all that he had told me
before, and not to forget it, and to think on it. That was
the last time I saw him, two summers ago. After we (my
family), left and got back to the north we found a letter
from my grandmother. They must have sent it right after
we left. In it she wrote that my abuelo felt that maybe
we shouldn't come down again because my father and
mother cry when those bad things happen and he doesn't
know what to do, and it makes him feel sad when people
cry because of him.
That was almost two years ago. Now when I think of
death, I remember those things my abuelo told me. I have
thought about them and they seem to me better than the
Christian's idea of hell and heaven and all that other bull-
shit about how to live your life according to their books.
I remember one bright sunny morning, (with a little breeze
coming from where the sun rises) my abuelo telling me that
a man comes into and leaves this life alone. I remember
that he told me that there was a reason for this and that I
should think about it until I found out what the reason was.
1 recall one night in the desert, with the stars so close you
could reach up and touch them he told me that a man
should live strategically because death is always just behind
you. When I think of death, mostly what I think about is
something my grandfather told me the last time I saw him
2 years ago. We were walking by the Rio Grande and I was
sad because I remembered how when I was little he used
to put me on his shoulders and carry me that way, and I
could see so far because I was so high up, and now I had to
help him walk because if I didn't he would fall. He saw that
I was sad. I remember he said that people and animals and
plants and every thing else were the same and that I shouldn't
be sad because as long as I lived and thought about him he
would still be around; that what was in my head was what
was real and that all I had to do was close my eyes and he
would be there. I said that that was just a memory and not
the same. My abuelo told me he loved me and that I made
dicing both harder and easier. He saw that I was about to
cry so he said, "My grandfather told me something once that
I think you should know. He said that life is like a circle.
There is really no end. He said that this body we live in is
just like a seed. When we die the seed breaks open and the
flower inside grows and grows trying to reach the sun, but
sometimes it doesn't, so it makes seeds and trys again.
So you shouldn't be sad; what you should do is say good-
bye and have a good trip." So that's what I think death is.
It is when a body breaks open and lets your spirit out and
it tries to reach the great spirit. If it makes it then you are
one with everything. If not, you go back and start again.
Sometimes the seed is rotten and then you have bad
people. Sometimes the seed is put in good earth and ma-
tures strong and straight.
I love my abuelo. When he dies, I think he will go and
touch the great spirit. If I live the way that was taught
to me I will touch the great spirit also.

MEN, AS WELL AS MflThEMflTJCS
Most of us, I'm sure are too caught up with trying to
understand the calculus to pay much attention to its
historical development. However, once past that first barrier,
it becomes natural, I think, to wonder about the men that
came up with that "limitless" expanse of mathematics, and
how they did it.
Although Issac Newton (1642-1727) and Gottfried
Wilhelm Leibniz (1664-1716) are generally credited with
having discovered it independently, the real development
and perfection of the calculus spanned thousands of years
before their time, and still continues today.
In the usual college course on the calculus, differen-
tiation is studied before integration. However, in the actual
development of things, it was the other way around. Inte-
gration, as a means of finding areas, was first crudely
approximated by a Greek, Eudoxus of Cnidus (408-
-355 B.C.), in what is known as the method of exhaustion.
This technique, which is based on an axiom loosely equiva-
lent to our

VS &lt;r&lt;1
was used repeatedly by Eudoxus and his followers
prove relationships (as ratios, usually) between the ar&lt;
and/or volumes of various figures. Unfortunately, t
method of exhaustion is useless when it comes to deriv't
the relationships, rather then merely proving them. S
while its discovery marked a great step forward in matl
matical rigor, it was a somewhat sterile advance.
It wasn't until Archimedes of Syracuse (287-212 B.I
that a constructive means of finding areas was four
Ironically, Archimedes' Method as it is known, was li
until 1906, when it was found amid a collection of ten
century manuscripts in Constantinople. Although not
rigorous as Eudoxus' method of exhaustion, it was infinit

even with the full use of the integral calculus!
Archimedes died during the Roman capture of Syracuse
(Legend has it that a Roman soldier discovered him calmly
working with figures drawn on the ground. When Archi-
medes rebuked the soldier for disturbing his "circles," the
Roman drew his sword and killed the old man.), and after
him Greek mathematicians concentrated on other areas.
Eventually, the Greek mathematicians became more and
more just commentators, and the center of mathematics
moved to Arabia, where the foundations of our number
system and algebra were laid (our word algebra comes from
the title of one of the best known Arabic texts on the
subject). Still, the calculus - such as it was - languished un-
known.
In the century or so preceding Newton and Leibniz,
however, there was a flurry of activity leading directly to
the calculus. The astronomer Johannes Kepler modified the
Eudoxian method of exhaustion (and possibly Archimedes'
Method, too) in his calculations which led to his three laws
of planetary motion. Later, he expanded this work in a
short treatise on the volumes of wine barrels (Stereometria
doliorum, 1615). This work caught the eye of Bonaventura
Cavalieri, a student of Gallileo's, and Cavalieri used it to
develop his "method of indivisibles." Out of this work,
which appeared in 1635, he was able to derive the special
result which we would write as
n +1
(Although this was known to others at the time, Cavalieri
was the first to publish it, in 1647. This confusion over
attribution of discoveries will crop up often in this article.)
Still, the most significant development of the early 17th
century was undoubtedly the discovery of analyticgeometry
by Rene Descartes and Pierre Fermat J Without it to
provide the link between geometry and functions (a concept
not clearly defined until the late 17th century), the calculus
may never have been born.
Although they were contemporaries and rivals of a sort,
Descartes and Fermatwere entirely dissimilar. Descartes was
a "gentleman," a professional soldier who wandered about
Europe looking for a good fight—and often finding it. His
major mathematical work. La Geometric, Published in
1637) in which he first presents his analytic geometry, was
merely an appendix to a more general (and voluminous)
It is interesting to note that three of the most significant develop
nwnts in modern mathematics - analytic geometry, the calculus, and
ion-Euclidean geometry - all were discovered independently by
different men at the same time. In addition to the Descartes/Fermat
and Newton/Leibniz co-discoveries, both mentioned in this article,
we have the work of both Janos Bolyai and Nikolas Lobatchewsky
on non-Euclidean geometry during the early Nineteenth Century.
Interestingly enough, both of these men were proceeded by
"The Prince of Mathematicians," Carl Friedrich Gauss, who simply
"ode notes in his diary without publishing them.
Archimedes of Syracuse. One of the greatest of the Greek
mathematicians, Archimedes developed an integration tech-
nique with which he found areas and volumes of complex
figures. Although he viewed himself as a pure mathe-
matician, he is considered the first engineer, because of
his work in hydrodynamics and levers, two areas still
governed by Archimedean laws. When the Romans under
Marcellus attacked Syracuse, Archimedes designed the
war machines which held off the Romans for two years.
Finally, they took the city, and Archimedes was killed.
work on philosophy and truth, whose title is twenty-six
words long.^ Descartes fancied himself a philosopher as
much as a mathematician, and his religious views kept
him in controversy with the authorities, wherever he lived.
Fermat, on the other hand, was not so much a limelighter,
and wasn't even a professional mathematician. (He had no
formal mathematical education.) His lifelong work was as a
bureaucrat in Toulouse. Fermat rarely published, and often
didn't even prove his assertions, but he was almost always
proven right, if only by someone else. Most of his work in-
cluding that on analytic geometry, has come to us through
letters to contemporaries, as there were no mathematical
journals in his day.
While the two of them share historical honors for
analytic geometry, Fermat by himself laid some important
groundwork for the calculus. Archimedes had done some
work on the problem of tangents to curves, but this general

WHAT'S IN A NAME?
Rene Descartes, who along with Pierre Format, discovered
analytic geometry. Among his other accomplishments,
Descartes began our modern exponential notation, as
in Xn, and also pioneered in imaginery numbers.
Many, if not most, mathematical formulae are identified
(supposedly) with the name of the person responsible for
their discovery or proof: Taylor's Theorem, L'Hospital's
Rule, etc. Ironically, many of these are misattributions.
For example, Stirling's Formula, is due to Abraham
De Moivre, a friend of Newton's; but Stirling is repaid when
Colin Maclaurin is given credit for Stirling's development of
the Maclaurin Series - some 25 years before Maclaurin used
it!
The best comedy of credit comes from L'Hospital's
Rule, however. The Marquis G.F.A. de L'Hospital was not a
mathematician per se, merely a student of Jean Bernoulli's.
Bernoulli, however, allowed L'Hospital to publish a book
on the differential calculus - the first ever - using Bernoulli's
work. The book appeared under L'Hospital's name in
1696, and the rule for indeterminate limits has ever since
been known as L'Hospital's Rule.
sort of problem, which characterizes the differential calculus
had not received nearly the attention as had area (quadra-
ture) problems, which characterize the integral calculus.
About 1629, however, Fermat began work on what we
would call maxima-minima problems. In this unpublished
treatise, he describes a method equivalent to requiring
,im f (x + E)-f (E)
E-0 E
which is the same as requiring that the derivative of f(x)
is zero. Later, Fermat was to generalize the method to
finding the slope at any point, rather then just an extreme
point.
As with Cavalieri's quadrature formulae, Fermat had
only been studying special cases, curves of the form
y=xn. Furthermore, few mathematicians of the time had
yet recognized that tangent (differential) and area (integra-
tion) problems were inverses of each other, although
Fermat should have, simply by looking at his tangent
formulae and Cavalieri's area formulae. One of the first
to do so was an Englishman names Isaac Barrow, who was
followed as a professor at Cambridge by another Isaac, Isaac
Newton.
Newton was born, prematurely, on Christmas Day,
1642. During his childhood on a farm in Woolsthorpe, Isaac
showed a knack for tinkering and experimentation. He
made a toy gristmill (powered by a captive mouse) and a
water clock. But his scholastic progress did not pick up
until one day in grammar school. The class bully picked a
fight with Newton, and the future genius beat him badly.
Supposedly, this incident spurred Newton to prove his mind
as good as his fists, and he promptly rose from the bottom
to the top of his class.
Eventually, it was decided to send the boy to college, so
in 1661 he went to Cambridge and enrolled in Trinity
College. His interest in mathematics was tweaked at this
time by, of all things, a book on astrology. During
most of 1664-1665, the College was closed because of an
outbreak of Bubonic Plague in London, so Newton went
home to Woolsthorpe.
It was probably the most productive college vacation in
history. In this two year period, Newton 1) proved the
binomial theorem for rational exponents; 2) invented the
differential calculus; 3) discovered the univeral law of
gravitation;^ 4) and established his three laws of motion,
which were fo form the foundation of Classical, or
Newtonian Physics.
''Actually, Newton did not "discover" the law of gravity. The
idea of an inverse-square law had been discussed by others before
him. Newton, however, was able to show (with his calculus) that
an inverse-square law was compatible with Kepler's Laws of
Planetary Motion, thus gaining credit for the "discovery."
16


Isaac Newton was so disgusted by controversy that he
refused to publish after his first works on optics were
ill-received. Years later, this was to draw him into a bitter
feud with Leibniz over who had discovered the calculus
first Newton's work proceeded Leibniz's, but he had not
published any of it. Ironically, his ill-received work on
optics was eventually modified, and the Newtonian cor-
puscular theory of light was viewed as correct until
modern times, when the concept of light as a "wavicle"
was developed. Newton's accomplishments outside math-
ematics were so great, and his services to his country so
appreciated, that he was buried in Westminster Abbey
in 1727. The French philosopher, Voltaire, who attended
the funeral, later said, "I have seen a professor of
mathematics, only because he was great in his vocation,
buried like a king who had done good to his subjects."
Ironically, when Newton returned to Cambridge in
1667, he devoted his time mostly to research in optics, a
field he had also devoted some time to while quarantined
from the Plague, and one in which he was to make the least
impact. However, this work was to have far-reaching con-
sequences, if not for optics, then for mathematics.Newton's
ideas on colors were vehemently attacked by critics, and
Newton was driven to vow that he would never again
Publish anything on science. Every one of his later works,
including the massive Principle, was published at the in-
sistence of friends, but this delay in publication was only
to draw him into a far worse controversy over the calculus.
The keystone to Newton's calculus, which he eventually
called the method of fluxions, was his recognition of the
validity of infinite analysis. Ever since the ancient Greek
mathematicians had tried to avoid the infinite, except for a
few pioneers like Eudoxus and Archimedes (whose Method
was lost by now). In the course of his work on the binomial
theorem, Newton came to the realization that infinite ex-
pressions have the same inner consistency as do finite ones:
"And whatever the common Analysis performs by
Means of Equations of a finite number of Terms. . . this
new method can always perform the same by Means of
infinite Equations."
This first form of the calculus was communicated to
Barrow by letter in about 1669. Later, in 1671, he revised
it some, gave it the name and notation of fluxions, and
wrote The Method of Fluxions; typically, the book was not
published until Newton was nine years dead.
Newtonian calculus proceeds much like present informal
treatments. He considered points on a curve to be moving
in the plane (hence the name fluent, to indicate flowing
motion). If x represents the changing quantity (or fluent),
then x is its fluxion. Newton also defined a quantity
o, an infinitesimally small time interval. Then xo was the
moment of a fluent, and in any problem, we may ignore
terms containing powers of o higher than two. Then, using
the quantity (x+ xo) as we use (x + Ax), he was able to cal-
culate derivatives for most functions then known. With this
ability, Newton solved problems in maxima-minima; radius
of curvature, integration and arc length, and differential
equations.
Although he had made his tremendous advances at an
early age. Newton continued to work, primarily in celestial
mechanics and in perfecting his law of gravity (which was
still not published). It wasn't until 1684, at the prodding of
the astronomer Halley, that he began collecting his ideas for
publication in what became Principia, his monumental
treatise on science in general. It was finally published in
1687, at Halley's personal expense.
His steadfast refusal to publish anything prior to this
eventually involved Newton in a disgraceful controversy
over prior discovery of the calculus. Between 1673 and
1676, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz also developed his version
of the calculus. Leibniz was a true universal genius, who
taught himself Latin and Greek as a child, and was a master
of law, philosophy, theology and mathematics. Except for
notational differences, which were imense, Leibniz's
calculus was very similar to Newton's. It was Leibniz who
introduced the dy/dx notation for derivatives, and he was
the first to use a script S as an integral sign. Although, he,
too, delayed publication (until 1684), his work still appeared
publically before Newton's. And, to fuel the fire of
controversy, charges and counter-charges flew that the one
had been aware of the other's work through private com-
munications.
Actually, neither of the two mathematical geniuses
wanted any part of the argument. But their nationalistic
adherents drew them into it, until such petty acts as New-
ton dropping all reference to Leibniz in Principia took place.
Both men were extremely embittered by the feud, and
English mathematics was done great harm, for they with-
drew in indignant disgust from the European community,
with the result that English mathematics foundered in a sea
of poor notation and isolation, much to its own detriment.
While the adherents of Newton and Leibniz were making
17


Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz was an admirer of Newton's
until the feud split them. Leibniz taught himself the
classics as a boy, and eventually earned a doctorate of
laws from the University of Altforf, in Nuremburg, at
the age of twenty. He also studied theology, philosophy,
and mathematics as an undergraduate. Professionally, he
was a diplomat for the royal family of Hanover, who
eventually gave us King George III of England. He visited
London twice, and these visits were much touted during
the feud over the calculus, for he could have seen some
of Newton's work in manuscript form. However, modern
scholars doubt that it would have meant much to Leibniz,
for he was not yet well-versed in geometry or analysis.
Outside the calculus, Leibniz worked with the binary
number system and complex numbers. He also developed
the kinetic energy concept along with Christopher Huygens.
When the Elector of Hanover became George I of England,
Leibniz was left behind to find new employment for him-
self. Two years later, in 1716, he dies, a lonely man.
Only his personal secretary attended the funeral.
LEON HARD EULER
1707- 17S3
monumental contributions to the theory of controversy and
poor taste, mathematics moved on. In a last fling of
prominence before spite drove them into isolation, two
British mathematicians made a mark that college math stu-
dents have since regretted. Brooks Taylor published his
infamous expansion theorem in 1715, with, incidentally,
absolutely no consideration of convergence. Two years
later, James Stirling set down what we know as the Mac-
laurin Series expansion, which is simply Taylor's Series
about the point x 0.
By 1700, however, most of what we consider the
calculus had been developed, although not rigorously. The
rest of the century was taken up with the rampant applica-
tion of the calculus to every imaginable area by the
Bernoulli family, and a Swiss named Leonhard Euler.
The "rigorization" of calculus, and the emergence of
analysis per se did not come until the 19th century, and
men like Cauchy, Gauss, and Weierstrauss.

Prof.
Victor Streeter
When most students think of fluid mechanics, they
think of their text. Fluid Mechanics, written by Professor
Victor Streeter of the Civil Engineering Department. Pro-
fessor Streeter will be remembered by his students for his
teaching ability besides his book when he retires this May
after a career devoted to fluids and hydraulics.
Professor Streeter, born in Michigan, received his BSE
ICE) in 1931, MSE in 1932 and ScD in 1934 from the
University of Michigan. He engaged in postdoctoral studies
at Gottingen and Karlsruhe in 1935-36 after being awarded
the 1935-36 ASME Freeman Travel Scholarship. In 1952
he was the visiting Fulbright Lecturer at the University of
New Zealand.
In 1934, after he received his doctorial degree, he went
to work for the Hydraulic Laboratory of the U.S. Bureau
of Reclamation in Denver. He changed employers in 1939
to the U.S. Section of the International Boundary Commi-
ssion working on river investigations. In 1941 Professor
Streeter decided to teach and went to I IT where he taught
mechanics and hydraulics at Armour Research. In 1954
Professor Streeter came to the University of Michigan to
teach hydraulics and has remained here since.
In the fall of this year Professor Streeter was awarded
the ASME Worcester Reed Warner Medal for his outstanding
contributions to the permanent literature of engineering.
The most well known of his books is Fluid Mechanics,
which is in its sixth edition. Two of the editions are trans-
lated into Spanish and it is reported to be used in Africa
and to have been translated into Russian. He has also
written Fluid Dynamics, which is a basic reference book,
and is co-author of Hydraulic Transients, a summary of his
work in the analysis and design of unsteady fluid problems.
The most widely used reference book in fluid dynamics.
Handbook of Fluid Dynamics, was edited by Professor
Streeter.
Even though Professor Streeter is retiring, he is not
giving up his research. He plans on continuing his present
work and possibly becoming involved with new projects
which the department is working on. Retirement will also
give him time to do some studying and reading. It will also
give Professor Streeter an opportunity to rewrite his
hydraulic transients book. There will also be more time to
guest lecture, attend conferences and hold intensive short
courses. There will also be more time to continue to do
consulting work.
At the present he does consulting work for Bechtel,
TV A, El Paso Natural Gas and Tippets Abbet McCarthy
Stratton (TAMS). Currently he is working on the problems
with the Tarbella Dam in Pakistan. When water goes
through the pipes downstream, the entire dam shakes to the
extent that seismographs record the tremors 10 miles away.
There are so many factors to take into effect that it is an
extremely complex problem.
Most of the work which Professor Streeter is doing now
deals with hydraulic transients. Work on this subject was
greatly restricted until computers were utilized to solve
complex multivariable systems of equations. Flow of
blood in the body, hydrofoils, feeder system of the Los
Angeles Power Supply, and diesel fuel ejection systems
are all transients; all use the same basic equations with
different parameters.
Professor Streeter has little leisure time at the present
because of his involvement with computer work. Retire-
ment should make little difference in the amount of
leisure he has because of his dedication to research.

Ill Ml
by Ray Barry
Every year about this time the atmosphere around the
college becomes noticeably tense; normally calm people
develop a nervous twitch, unexciteable students carry
worried looks, and those less stable verge on collapse.
An outsider might attribute these symptoms to finals or to
the telltale signs of a difficult year nearly completed.
Not so; as any engineer will testify, it's the anticipation of
the Marian S. Parker award.
Never heard of the Marion S. Parker Award? Never
heard of Marion S. Parker? With the controls of the Technic
Time Machine set for the early 1900's we are about to
find out.
The Marion S. Parker Award is an annual award given
to two outstanding female engineering or architecture
seniors. (The award was originated when the Colleges of
Engineering and Architecture were the same.) When the
college split into separate schools it was decided to
alternate the award between them. That is, one year two
engineering students receive the award and the next year
two architecture students get the honors.
Marion Parker was the one-and-only, bona-fide original,
female graduate of the College of Engineering and Archi-
tecture. Ms. Parker graduated way back in 1895 with a
Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering. She was hired
by a New York city based firm of consulting engineers
where she wasted no time in distinguishing herself in her
chosen field. Marion designed the structural steel work
and foundations of what were at that time some of the
most famous skyscrapers highlighting the New York
sky-line.
Ms. Parker's success was so great that it even warranted
mention in that publication of publications, you guessed
it, the Michigan Technic. just ten years after her graduation.
Today such achievements would go unnoticed, but in
an era when women were not allowed to smoke, vote, show
their ankles, and belonged in the home, Ms. Parker's
achievements are monumental. Imagine the guts it would
take to enter the college; the ridicule of friends and
relatives added to spending four years alone with other
students who felt you didn't belong there. Not only were
there no other women in engineering, there were fewer
women in college altogether. A woman didn't need an
education to have babies and take care of the house.
Prejudice doesn't end with the diploma. How many
open minded and courageous employers would be willing
to hire her for a "man's" job? After she was hired, how
much dirt did she have to take from her fellow workers,
presumably all male? How much less was she paid than
her masculine counterparts? At the very least she must have
felt constantly put to the test, always being asked to
prove herself. But she did prove herself and she did endure.
How immensely brave and determined she must have been
just to embark upon such a treacherous and untrodden path.
It's nice to know that such a person has not been
forgotten. To teach is a respectable accomplishment, to
open a mind is a miraculous one. Marion S. Parker must
surely have opened a few minds.
This year, the College of Engineering had the honor of
awarding the Marion Sarah Parker Award to an outstanding
graduate and undergraduate woman. The awardees were:
Shirley Delong (I &amp; O.E., grad) and Karen Bilich (Ch. E.,

engineers who were
born to lead.
Are you the kind of engineer who has what it takes to move into management someday?
If you are, you already know it.
Now what you need to know is which companies can offer you the best oppor-
tunities. We think you'll find General Electric is one.
We're a high technology company. And that means we have to have manag-
ers who understand technology—women and men —to run the place.
Today, over 60% of the top managers at General Electric hold technical
degrees. In fact, over 65% of the college graduates we hired last year held
technical degrees.
Of course, just leadership ability and a technical degree won't get
you into management. First, you're going to need solid engineering
experience and a broad understanding of business.
And we have a lot of ways to help you get it.
One is our Manufacturing Management Program. A two-year
program of rotating assignments that gives you broad experience
with different products and manufacturing processes.
Another is our Engineering Program. For engineers with an
interest in product and systems design and development.
There's also a Field Engineering Program, a Technical Market-
ing Program, plus a number of programs sponsored by product
operations.
And all with just one aim. To give you all the responsi-
bility and all the perspective you need to move into man-
agement. As fast as you can manage it.
Of course, starting on a program isn't the only way
to make it into management at GE. If you have a
specific product interest, we have many direct-
placement opportunities that can get your career
started fast, too.
What kinds of products can you work on
at GE? Over 230,000 different ones.
Maybe nuclear power plants. Or
more efficient fossil-fuel plants. Or
better mass-transit systems. Or medical
equipment. Pollution controls.
Engineering plastics. Cleaner, quieter
jet engines. Communications products.
You name it.

In a recent movie and current television show called
"The Invisible Man" the main character is a scientist who
invents a method of rendering objects, including human
beings, invisible. The military applications are obvious.
The company that employs the young brilliant scientist
reneges on it's promise not to market his inventions to
the military or for military applications. The main charact-
er obviously has strong convictions about the military
applications and the end consequences of his research.
Since World War II and the dropping of the bomb on
Hiroshima science and ethics have become inescapably
intertwined. Focusing in on the problem, the scientist
and engineer are often involved in an ethical conflict
with the government. The cover story for this month deals
with this subject. The article is one of last years winning
Cooley Essays. The author is Robert Wise, a Junior in
Electrical Engineering. The article is entitled "The Conflict
of Science and State: The Physicist's Dilemma."
Also this month Technic delves into the worlds com-
bining science and aesthetics. Electronic music is the
subject of this article. Beethoven's Fifth emanating from a
computer may sound ridiculous but it is a reality. Mark
Sankey reports on the subject of electronic music in an
article entitled "Man, Music, and Machine." For the hows
and whatnots of electronic music be sure to read this one.
Last year's regular feature "The Good Old Days" re-
turns this year in a new revised format. We're calling it
"50 and 25 Years Ago." Look out Scientific American!
In "50 and 25" we will be examining the Technic of the
years 1925 and 1950, pulling out poignant and pointed
pieces relating engineers, engineering thought, and life in
general of the past to the present.
Next, Technic digs into it's fabulous photo file with-
drawing some real gems! This may be hard to believe, but
these rejuvinated pictures were actually taken on this cam-
pus. Ah! To be an engineer in 1902 ....
Finally, because of large turnover in staff, the Technic
is looking for writers. If you would like to write for the
Technic, even though you don't think you are good enough,
come on up and see us. We would be more than happy to
talk to you. Unfortunately, there are no monetary benefits
but there are many other benefits. Working for us can be

Crisp: Need We Say More?
At the beginning of this term thousands of students had
the unique experience of standing in line for hours upon
hours in order to drop and add classes. The system
that made this all possible is a relatively new approach to
registration and drop-add known as Crisp. Crisp stands for
Computer Registration Involving Student Participation.
Crisp was conceived last year with the idea that regis-
tration could be accomplished with less hassle if the
student could "talk" to the computer directly through a
computer terminal and operator. Crisp worked remarkably
well last term to register students, and most students would
agree that it is quite an improvement over the old system
used for registration. Crisp, however, does not work very
well at all for dropping and adding classes. The fact is. Crisp
is one of the poorest methods ever adopted for drop-adds.
Why? The answer is simple: Standing in line for two
(or more) hours is not really necessary for drop-add.
Most of the students who stood in line for over two hours
were not there to completely re-vamp their schedules,
but only to drop and add one of two classes. The system
used last year to drop and add is almost one-hundred
percent better than Crisp because student participation is
not limited to standing in line. Previously students partici-
pated by filling out an optical scan form, getting a couple
of signatures, and delivering a few drop-add cards. The
former system also eliminates the hassle of arriving at a ter-
minal and finding out that the course you want to add is
full, having to go back and get a signature from a
prof, or TF, and then returning to Crisp only to face those
long lines again. The total time spent last year to drop and
add classes compared to Crisp is about one-third less, and
the old way involved students to the same degree, with the
exception of standing in line.
Participation seems to be the key word here. How does
the university define student participation? Standing in
line for two hours, possibly missing a class; being treated
as though you are a side of beef at a Chicago stock yard,
and finally getting to a terminal, sitting down, and watching
the operator punch the attention key thirty-seven times?
Is this student participation? If so, count me out.
Another fault of Crisp is the bad manners of the people
who are employed to operate the system. The last thing a
student needs after standing in line for two hours is
some lady (in the hall) yelling point blank into his (or her)
face. After this unfriendly person is passed by, the student
is quickly pushed into Crisp headquarters. The first thing
noticed is the fact that Crisp is guarded by a security
system equaled only by those to protect minuteman
launching sites: No one enters the wrong way without a
pass, and then, even if your credentials are in order the
already busy computer is asked to verify that you are really
you. If one is dropping and adding classes (as opposed to
registration) its different: There are two lines at Crisp,
one for drop-adds (the long one), and one for those who
were too lazy (or forgot) to early register. Drop-adds have
bottom priority: In other words the drop-add line doesn't
move unless everyone has registered for the day. This creates
a good excuse for people not to early register as the lines
encountered then are longer than the privileged late regis-
tration line at the beginning of the term.
Moral? Only this: This university has a bad habit of
treating it's students as if they are numbers instead of real
people. Crisp is a sad de-humanizing ordeal and in the
future it should be re-worked or abolished completely for
dropping and adding classes.

- Physicists' lament
1946
The tremendous growth of America's scientific com-
munity in the last thirty-five years is to a large extent the
result of the successful marriage of science and state.
Scientists have become dependent upon the federal gov-
ernment for the vast sums of money necessary to carry
out research today. However, this new relationship between
the U.S. Government and the scientific community has
posed a moral dilemma for scientists because of the under-
lying conflict between the purposes of science versus
those of the state. In an ideal sense, science is concerned
only with the discovery of truth, a universal pursuit
which knows no boundaries. However, the state is inter-
ested in science only insofar as it can be applied as a tool
of national policy. Thus, the new partnership arrangement
between science and state in this country has taken
science from its ivory tower and placed it into the turbu-
lent realm of politics.
The new relationship between science and state has
posed many ethical problems to the physicist. Physics was
once regarded as a pure art, with its ultimate purpose
being that of understanding the universe. However, today,
physics is often used as an instrument of the state, with
practical technological developments being stressed over
pure scientific research. Modern physics is responsible for
the creation of nuclear energy and its profound implica-
tions for civilization. Physicists have, in the words of the
late Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer, "knowingly interfered
with history." (2)
The development of the U.S. government's close rela-
tionship with physics research since World War II has
forced many physicists into the political arena to preserve
their integrity as scientists. In this article, I shall analyze
how physicists in this country have dealt with the ethical

entered their laboratories. How has the relationship between
the U.S. government and physics research evolved since
World War II? How has this relationship caused many
physicists to reevaluate their professional ethics to ac-
comodate their new role in society? After tracing the his-
torical development of the relationship between the U.S.
government and science since 1940, I will look at the views
of physicists themselves on the subject of political involve-
ment. These opinions will be based upon interviews which
I conducted with physicists at the University of Michigan.
I will then follow the movement into political activity of
those physicists concerned with the possible applications
of their work on society. Finally, I will examine what
scientists can actually accomplish in the public sector by
presenting an illustration of how a few concerned physi-
cists have had a tremendous impact on society in recent
months.
Prior to World War II, government and science in the
United States were quite independent of each other.
Research was carried out in small laboratories, and most
was financed by private institutions, such as the Rocke-
feller Foundation. The Constitution of the United States
provides Congress with the power to "promote the progress
of science and useful arts" by providing a patent system. (3)
Aside from the Patent Office, the United States government
did very little to promote science during the 160 years of
its existence prior to World War II. Science evolved apart
from government influence throughout this period. In
1939, the federal government allotted only $50 million
for research in all fields of science. (4)
World War II marks the turning point in the govern-
ment's relationship with science. World War II revived the
New Deal philosophy of government as a powerful tool
for dealing with social evils. (5) Scientists, like everyone
else, were caught up in the fight against Hitler. With the
achievement of nuclear fission in 1939, physicists became
aware of the potential power of a weapon which exploited
the energy of the atom. Concerned that Hitler's scientists
might create an atomic bomb, physicists in America urged
the United States government to initiate an atomic bomb
program of its own. Albert Einstein's famous letter to
President Franklin Roosevelt in 1939, in which Einstein
suggested the possibility of the development of the atomic
bomb, set into motion a chain of events' which led to its
creation. More importantly, Einstein's letter ended the
independence of science from government. (6)
Once the United States decided to proceed with the
construction of the atomic bomb, an entire army of
scientists was mobilized to complete the project. In 1940,
the National Defense Research Committee was organized
to support and coordinate weapons research. (7) The
Manhattan Project, which was the code name for the pro-
gram to build the bomb, evolved from this committee.
Unprecedented sums of money were spent for research on
the bomb. At that time, physicists viewed their work as a
"patriotic chore" which would end with the war. (8)
After the successful completion of their task and victory
over Japan, physicists returned to their universities and
laboratories. Unfortunately, the physicists were unable
to return to the relative isolation of the small laboratories
of pre-war vintage. "Big Science" had been created by the
many breakthroughs which occurred during World War II,
and physics had suddenly become a very expensive under-
taking. (9) Physicists turned to the government for money,
and the government was more than willing to finance their
projects.
The relationship between science and state developed
rather smoothly through the 1950's and into the 1960's.
There were a few minor setbacks, such as the 1953
Oppenheimer security case, which will be discussed later.
However, everyone was generally pleased with the arrange-
ment. Then, in the mid-1960's the tide began to turn
against the government. Vietnam was the catalyst for a
feeling of alienation from the government. Physicists be-
gan to take a second look at their relationship with the
government.
Before delving into the "problems of conscience" which
have led some physicists into the political arena, let's take
a look at the tie which most closely binds physics research
to the U.S. government—money.
Only the federal government can provide the huge sums
of money required to operate a modern physics laboratory.
The fantastic growth of federal support for research and
development (R&amp;D) is apparent when one looks at the
statistics. According to William D. Carey, former assistant
director of the U.S. Budget Bureau, the national government
spent $75 million for scientific R&amp;D in 1940. By 1953, this
figure had jumped to $2 billion, and in 1968 a whopping
$17 billion was spent for R&amp;D in the United States. (10)
In 1973, the federal government was expected to spend
$1.1 billion for research in the physical sciences alone. (11)
The federal government does not pour such vast sums
of money into research projects without expecting some sort
of return for its money. The major reason for federal
support of physics research becomes more apparent when
one looks at this fact: Military-related research receives 12
times as much money as research in the civilian field. (12)
Because physics has become an integral part of national
security, it seems that society has no qualms about pro-
viding funds for physics research entirely out of proportion
to its true value as a science. For example, in 1965 the
federal government provided $14 billion for research in the
physical and biological sciences. By comparison, research
in the social sciences was allotted $1 billion, and the

ment for research in 1965. (13)
The Department of Defense (DOD) is by far the largest
sponsor of physics research in this country. DOD agencies
find it easy to receive the money they ask for because the
word "defense" has an element of urgency about it. (14)
Money from DOD is not given altruistically to research
scientists in pursuit of "pure" science. The money is
given primarily for military purposes. (15) Harold Orlans
of the Brookings Institute asks this question about the
implications of federal funding in the physical sciences:
Has the dispassionate pursuit of truth
been redirected to the pursuit of truths
useful to the government and to that
subgovernment to which the power of
sparing life or inflicting death has been so
often delegated: the Department of
Defense? (16)
The mission-oriented type of research sponsored by the
Department of Defense is a far cry from the independently
conducted research of physicists before 1940. The entrance
of the state into the world of the scientist has generated a
considerable amount of turmoil within the scientific com-
munity.
The relationship between the physics community and
the government cannot possibly be a truly harmonious
partnership, because, by nature, science and state have con-
flicting ambitions. Science has traditionally involved the
search for truth, and this search is a pursuit which tran-
scends national boundaries or political ideologies. (17)
By contrast, the state serves the self-interest of a nationalis-
tic group of people whose primary concern is the mainten-
ance of their own well-being, possibly at the expense of
other people. (18) Robert Reid, author of Tongues of
Conscience, says:
Nationalism and chauvinism too have
raised their ugly heads in science. The
State, which looks upon itself as the
legitimate guardian of national resources,
has welcomed with open arms as many
of these applied offerings as it can con-
sider useful. And since every State, and
there are no exceptions, allows that war
is a valid instrument of national policy,
science finds itself up to the hilt in war-
fare, and itself involved in internal con-
flict. (191
How have physicists responded to the government's
intrusion into their laboratories? There are basically two
points of view within the physical scientists' community
on their relationship with the federal government. I will now
take a look at these views, as expressed by physicists them-
selves.
Professor Marc Ross, dean of the Residential College
and a faculty member of the Physics Department at the
University of Michigan, represents the "liberal" spectrum of
thought in the physics community. He is keenly aware of
the social relevance of physics as a science. A few years ago
Professor Ross actually switched fields, from high energy
physics to energy resources research, because he felt that
his new field has more relevance to the problems facing
society today.
According to Professor Ross, only about four out of
fifty faculty members in the Physics Department at Michi-
gan are very active politically. Ross believes that the attitude
of the great majority of physicists in this country is based
upon the belief that scientists should stay clear of politics,
and have faith in the "system" to make the right decisions
concerning public policy related to physics. It is Professor
Ross's estimate that only about 10% of the physicists in
this country actually do believe that scientists should make
their voices heard in the political arena, and then actually
act on this belief.
Professor Ross was very active in the campaign against
passage of the Safeguard anti-ballistic missile system. During
the period when Congress was considering Safeguard, Ross
engaged in activities opposing congressional approval of
the system. He wrote letters to magazines, newspapers,
and congressmen; gave talks on radio and to local organi-
zations in an effort to rally public opposition to Safeguard
within his department. Professor Ross believes that the
ABM controversy was a very viable political issue for
physicists to deal with because the system was feeble on a
technical basis. For this reason, some conservative physicists
were induced to add their voices in opposition to the Safe-
guard system, because of its weaknesses from a purely
scientific standpoint.
The only real control which Professor Ross believes that
physicists can wield over the type of research which the
federal government authorizes is through an indirect voice
in Congress. Congress controls the budget, and the budget
controls the type of work which is done. Ross says that
scientists' organizations are now attempting to have scien-
tists placed on legislators' staffs as congressional aides. In
that position, scientists would have a more direct input to
the people who make decisions which affect the scientific
community.
In contrast to Professor Ross's "activist" stance toward
physicists' relationship with the government, stand the
opinions of Professor Ken Ludema of the College of Engin-
eering. I believe that Ludema's beliefs are fairly representa-
tive of those of a great majority of physicists in this country.
Professor Ludema does not believe that the roles of
scientist/politician are compatible. According to Ludema,

from the military, and give scientists some voice in
decisions regarding the development of new weapons. (29)
The NSF was designed to promote pure science by stressing
basic research in the projects it sponsors. (30) Although
neither program was entirely successful in providing physi-
cists with control over the type of research which they
perform, the mere fact that physicists had become lobby-
ists marked an important milestone. (31) Physicists had
destroyed the myth that science is "neutral," and they
were intent upon informing society of the possible effects
of their work. (32)
Throughout the 1950's, physicists become more closely
involved with government as advisors. However, the inten-
sity of their contest with government over the direction
of physics research was greatly diminished by a change in
the political climate. Senator Joseph McCarthey's "Witch
hunts" caused most people to think twice before uttering
a statement which might cast the government in a bad
light. (33) Physicists were no exception. The Oppenheimer
security case sent many physicists "scurrying" back to their
laboratories, where they once again immersed themselves
in their work. (34)
The leader of the Manhattan Project, Robert Oppenhei-
mer, began to have serious misgivings about the atom bomb
after World War II. During the early 1950's, Oppenheimer
voiced his strong opposition to the development of the
hydrogen bomb. He symbolized the conscience of America's
liberal intellectuals. (35) In 1953, Oppenheimer's security
clearance was revoked because of his opposition to the
hydrogen bomb. An attempt to organize a scientific work
stoppage to protest the government's action in the Oppen-
heimer case fizzled. The general attitude of physicists on
the subject of political involvement during the 1950's was
expressed by Vannevar Bush of the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology (M.I.T.), when he said, "There should be a
complete removal of the system from politics. There will
be no scientific strike." (36)
The conscience of the physicist was revived in the 1960's,
"problems of conscience" in the scientific community led
to serious disenchantment with the symbiotic relationship
between science and government. (37) Physicists became
increasingly radical in their opposition to government policy.
The M.I.T. break with the Instrumentation Laboratory
in 1970 is a prime example of the anti-government feelings
which swept the campus scientific community during the
late 1960's.
The Instrumentation Laboratory was responsible for
the development of inertial guidance systems. On May 20,
1970, M.I.T. President Howard Johnson announced that
M.I.T. would no longer sponsor the Instrumentation
Laboratory. This announcement followed a year long
:ontroversy over military related research on campus. (38)
The controversy was ignited by a group of students and
faculty members who demanded the conversion of univer-
sity technological resources toward the solution of social
aroblems. Included in the activists' group were physicists,
as well as biologists, chemists, and mathematicians. (39)
M.l.T.'s decision to sever its relationship with the
Instrumentation Laboratory reflects a growing concern of
universities over government-supported on-campus research.
The controversy surrounding the Instrumentation Labora-
tory is an example of the overt political action which was
undertaken by many physicists during the 1960's. Although
these actions had developed from the postwar "ethic of
responsibility," the attempt to bring about institutional
action which would effect a change in government policy
was a new idea. (40)
A proliferation of activist scientific organizations occurred
during the late 1960's. (41) Parading the theme, "Science
for the People," these organizations hoped to shift the
attention of research scientists to matters of more pressing
social concern. (42) More than ever before, physicists had
become conscious of society and their role in society.
One of the newly formed groups. Scientists and Engineers
for Social and Political Activity (SESPA), a radical caucus
within the American Physical Society, circulated a petition
during June, 1969, at the Berkeley campus of the Univer-
sity of California. The petition, signed by 80 faculty
members, read as follows:
/ pledge that I will not participate in
war research or weapons production. I
further pledge to counsel my students and
urge my colleagues to do the same. (43)
In addition to on-campus activity, efforts were under-
way throughout the latter part of the 1960's to enlarge
the content of physics journals and societies to encompass
matters of social and political concern. The activist physi-
cists have sought to remove the "precious sanctuary" aura
of physics research, and force physicists into the real
world. (44)
Political activity among physicists has been more muted
during the last few years. One possible explanation is
because the United States is no longer militarily engaged in
southeast Asia. The question of the morality of weapons
research is no longer in the forefront of people's minds.
However, although the conflict of science and state may not
be a burning issue in the minds of physicists at this time,
the dilemma remains unsolved.
Opposition to government policy often leads to un-
pleasant consequences. An article in Look Magazine called,
"The University Arsenal," presented the case of a Stanford
physicist:

of two, is opposed to the Vietnam War.
In February, Dick heard Stanford Re-
search Institute President Charles Ander-
son argue that no researcher was forced
to take on any project he found morally
objectionable. Dick stood up: 'Sir I
was pressured into doing chemical warfare
research.' That candor, he learned later,
nearly cost him his security clearance...
When I found Jerry Dick, he'd been
fired. (45)
Physicists in industry are especially vulnerable to pressure
against opposing research projects. Their jobs are on the line.
Regardless of what one's moral beliefs are, one still must
support one's family. Professor Marc Ross believes that
physicists who work for private firms are, for the most
part, very submissive to demands that they perform research
projects, even if they find these projects to be morally
objectionable.
An expression of dissent with government policy can
lead to denial of federal research grants. Physicists are
inhibited from publicly expressing their views on political
matters because of their dependency on federal funds to
continue their research. (46) The federal government also
denies government positions on the basis of political beliefs.
In 1969, President Nixon offered Dr. Franklin Long the
directorship of the National Science Foundation. Two
weeks later Nixon withdrew his offer because Dr. Long
had expressed his opposition to the anti-ballistic missile
program, and his strong support for arms control. Apparent-
ly one must hold the "correct" attitudes toward the
military-industrial complex if one is to be appointed to a
high level post in even the most civilian of science
agencies. (47)
Physicists are well aware of the possible consequences
of their political activity. However, the development of the
"ethic of social responsibility" in the years following
World War II has caused many physicists to accept these
consequences as the price for their professional mtegrity.
For all the risk they take, can concerned physicists actually
accomplish political objectives worthy of their gamble?
The answer, fortunately, seems to be "yes." I shall conclude
my paper with an illustration of how Professor Ralph
Cicerone of the University of Michigan and several other
physicists have recently had a great impact on government
policy.
During the last few years. Professor Cicerone and
several colleagues gathered sortie very disturbing information
on the effect of freon upon the ozone in the earth's
atmosphere. For a detailed account of the technical back-
ground to the problem, and the calculations which led
them to their findings, see Flourocarbons—Impact on
Health and Environment. (48) Briefly, what Cicerone
and others found is that freon, a substance most com-
monly used as a propellant in aerosal cans, is destroying
the ozone layer in our atmosphere at an alarming rate. If the
use of freon is continued at present levels of consumption,
the incidence of skin cancer resulting from exposure to
solar radiation will increase markedly as the earth's ozone
shield is depleted.
In September, 1974, Cicerone, along with Richard
Stolarski and Stacy Walters of the Space Physics Research
Laboratory at the University of Michigan, went to the
public with their findings. (49) The freon problem made
headline news last fall, and since then Professor Cicerone
says, "I haven't had any time to myself." He has been on
the move ever since, testifying before congressional com-
mittees, attending conferences, and satisfying demands for
public appearances. These demands on his time have de-
tracted from his work as a scientist. However, the impact
of his action will very probably be the enactment in the
near future of state and federal laws designed to prohibit
or severely restrict the use of freon. It was not an easy
decision for Cicerone to go public with his findings, and he
is the first to admit that he is no lobbyist. However, Professor
Cicerone believed that the threat to public health was
serious enough to warrant the type of action which he and
the other physicists took. The fact that Cicerone's actions
are having a very positive impact on the government's policy
with respect to the use of freon should serve as an en-
couraging sign for other scientists concerned about their
ability to affect public policy.
As a result of the development of the relationship be-
tween the U.S. government and physics research since
World Way II, physicists have developed conflicting attitudes
about their new role in society. We have seen that a majority
of physicists do not believe that they should play a
politically active role in the shaping of public policy.
However, we have also seen that for a small but active
minority of physicists in this country, the role of physics
in today's society has forced them to respond to new
social ethic. These physicists have chosen to enter the
political process as active participants.
Modern physics is not a "pure" science. The results
of physics research may have social or political impact far
greater than their scientific significance. Because the phy-
sicist no longer works in the "ivory tower" of the past, he
may often encounter situations when he must weigh the
value of his work against its possible effects upon mankind.
It is the new feeling of "social" responsibility for their
work which has led many physicists from their laboratories
and into the political arena. The growth of the relationship
between science and government in this country has served
as the stimulus for the politicization of these physicists. The
French author Rabelais once wrote, "Science without
conscience is but ruination of the soul." (50) Hopefully,
physicists have saved their souls. Lftafl

whereas that of a plucked instrument would look more like:

Another electronic source is the noise generator. The
name noise is generally given to sounds that are produced
by air particles in random motion. In contrast to the output
of an oscillator, noise contains many unrelated frequencies.
Since the musician can separate many sounds out of this
noise, implementing noise is very useful. Clearly, the
dictionary definition of noise, which implies unwanted
sound, does not apply here. Noise plays an important role in
the sounds of percussion instruments.
The "raw" sounds produced by the above sources are
altered by any combination of modifiers which can turn
theseuncut sounds into something more in much the same
way a stone would be shined to become part of a mosaic.
One widely used modifier is the filter. A filter changes
the tone color or timbre (frequency content) of the signal
passing through it. A typical synthesizer would have many
different kinds of filters whose characteristics can be changed
via a control voltage. By changing the frequency character-
istics rapidly, one may obtain the popular "wah-wah"
effect or that of a muted trumpet.
Another commonly heard effect in popular music is
deliberate distortion. This is done by clipping the signal
above a maximum level. This causes sharp edges in the re-
sulting waveform which, when heard, sounds fuzzy.
Envelope generators, control the shape of a sound on a
more long-term basis than oscillators. This can be used to
simulate the sound of conventional instruments to a certain
extent. For instance, a blown instrument has a waveform
that might look like this:
Reverberation is that spatial effect created by sounds
reflecting off walls and reaching the listener at a slightly
later time than the direct wave. This delay can be done
electromechanically by a tape recorder or by passing the
sound through a set of springs.
Ever hear a song with that whooshing turned inside-out
sound? This is what happens when a tone is mixed with a
changing phase-shifted version of itself. This kind of altera-
tion is especially useful with drum and cymbal sounds;
the result of a "smoky" percussion sound.
The last type of modifier I will describe (there are many
others not dealt with here) is that which includes ring
modulators and frequency shifters. These devices alter the
input signals in rather complex ways to produce something
not possible with regular instruments or anything else for
that matter.
These sources and modifiers may be intercorfnected in
any number of different ways to fashion sounds from the
everyday to the bizarre.
Next these tones are put together to make a song with
multiple-track tape recorder and mixer. Because it may take
some doing to obtain the desired note, and because the
synthesizer is basically a one-note-at-a-time instrument, this
process takes much time and effort even for a short piece.
This, unfortunately, limits the synthesizer's use as a perfor-
mance, real time instrument. There are smaller synthesizers
available, oriented toward performance, but these pay the
price of being less flexible.
Another means of producing electronic music involves
the digital computer. When I first heard of computers
making music, I was skeptical. After all, how can something
as pragmatic as a computer be responsible for anything as
aesthetic as music? Well, the computer merely does what
it is told to do by the player, just like with any other in-
strument.
Music programs have been developed at Bell Labs and
elsewhere to allow the user-composer to specify every aspect
of a song; rhythm, tempo, pitches, durations of single note
spaces in between, relative loudness and tone quality, and
even orchestral accompaniments. In addition many of the
modifying functions of a synthesizer can be selected by the
user of desired.
Out of the computer comes a bunch of numbers which
are converted to analog form and recorded on tape. Again,
the major disadvantage of all this is that it takes a lot of
time and clerical work to translate a music score into
something suitable as input to the music programs. Possibly
a new standardized music notation would solve this problem.
Just as the new technology has been used to produce
new sounds, it has also been used to mimic the sounds of

extent, but somehow it never sounds quite real. The ques-
tion is, what makes a clarinet sound like a clarinet? Or,
what determines our perception of a specific sound? One
thing is the tone color or timbre of the sound. Physically,
this is relative amplitudes of the overtones of the note
played. While a wide variety of tone colors may be pro-
duced on an organ or synthesizer, once selected it does
not change for that note. In a regular musical instrument,
this tone quality changes rapidly with time in a way that
is not completely understood. This difference makes it easy
to tell the original from the mimic. One approach to this
problem in synthesizers has been to vary the timbre
randomly during the course of a single note. This has still
not resulted in realistic limitations.
Another factor in the perception of for instance, a
piano, is the initial sound made when the hammer strikes
the string. If this transient is not heard by a listener, he is
not as likely to associate the sound with a piano.
Imitations of regular instruments by electronic ones often
lack these initial sounds. This coupled with the lack of
harmonic variations described above made the attempts at
mimicking often sound plastic.
This new music has changed the relationship between
a writer of music and his audience. Conventionally, the
composer writes a piece of music, then a performer (possibly
the composer) plays and interprets this piece to an audience.
In the electronic medium, due to the fact that the song is
put together on tape, the composer moves into the role of
performer and has more of a direct relationship with his
audience. This allows more freedom for the artist, since
he is no longer limited by the abilities of human perfor-
mers, but on the other hand, the interpretations made
by these performers are lost. Further, the composer of
electronic music is limited to what a very human audience
can hear and respond to. In other words, a composer of this
music can control every facet of a musical production to a
fine degree except for room acoustics and audience re-
ceptivity.
According to M.L. Eaton, in the future, it may be that
composers will gain control of this audience receptivity.
Increasingly, music is being written to have a desired and
contrived effect. Witness for instance the soft happy music
they play in waiting rooms and department stores as well
as the catchy, attention-getting songs heard on commercials.
Eaton envisions a control system with the audience as that
being controlled. If the desired effect from a piece of
music can be made objective and measured, then this can
be fed back to the sound source to modify the sound so it
produces more of the desired effect. It would therefore be
possible to shape and fashion music as chemicals are made
and mixed into medicines for a specific purpose. This would
make music a very powerful tool, even more than now.
It has even been speculated that someday these psychologi-
cal and physical states may be induced directly without any
need for sound at all!
In summary, what we have here is a relatively new means
of musical communication in which, because of ingenuity,
flexibility and control, the roles of the people in the music
chain are changed and the future appears bright. |\/|

We have a whole library for you. So you can start learning
for yourself how Full-Depth (Ta) asphalt paving can be
used to great advantage. It's an energy saver and money
saver, too. This becomes particularly clear with stage
construction. You can design the asphalt pavement needed
now for today's traffic and plan to add more pavement
strength in stages as traffic volumes and weights increase.
Another big area is road upgrading—for economy reasons
—and again, asphalt is the answer. It's ideal for road
overlaying, strengthening or widening. There's a lot more
to know about asphalt. And it's all worth knowing. To get

50 and 25
Years Ago
By Ray Barry
50 Years Ago
An ad in the Oct. 1925 Technic listed new Chevrolets
ranging in price up to S825. They don't call them the "good
old days" for nothing, however, given the choice between
a 1925 Chevrolet and a 1976 Camero .... is there really any
comparison?
Mass transportation is a topic on the minds of many
modern day politicians and engineers alike. Mass transit
is not a new concern, though. An article entitled "Electric
Railways - Do we need them?" garnered the cover story
slot at the Technic this month 50 years ago.
According to the article, the first street railway operating
in the U.S. was opened in 1832. The cars were horse
hauled, naturally. Did they measure mileage in miles per
bushel? The first cable car, according to the author was
introduced in San Francisco (where else?) in 1873, and the
first electric trolley in Richman, Va. in 1888. So, mass
transit is hardly a new concept.
Some interesting predictions were made by the author. He
predicted that the bus would not survive under the control
of private companies, it would survive only as a public
utility. Aren't people saying that still today? He also pre-
dicted the electric railway would prosper in the future in
big cities, but he probably never envisioned the likes of
BART. And he predicted a rosy future for mass transit
caused by a waning in the use of the private automobile.
The use of the automobile was to begin declining when the
public realized the high cost of operation, estimated at ten
to twenty-five cents per mile. Considering inflation, we are
not doing so badly in comparison.
Expressing the need for improved roadways to alleviate
the automobile traffic congestion problems, the author
offers the opinion that the taxes to complete such a task
could not be raised because the taxation situation had
reached the "limit of financial endurance." Sound familiar?
Another article appearing in that same issue dealt with
the study performed at U. of M. concerning the measurement
of sound. The concern with measuring sound was not direc-
ted at the effects of noise on humans, it was directed
toward applications in industry. That is, the inspection of
manufactured goods, the theory being that faulty products
could be detected by the amount of noise they produce.
An article entitled "Current Studies In Engineering
Education" made note of the fact that about sixty percent
of the original freshman class fall by the wayside before
graduation. Evidently it wasn't any easier then.
Finally, there was a story on how fire resistant, sturdy,
sanitary, earth quake resistant, sound proof, and well
insulated concrete houses are known to be. It's a funny
thing they didn't catch on better.
25 Years Ago
Bigness, it appears, was something to brag about in
1950, a source of pride. Some of the advertising placed in
the Oct. Technic a quarter century ago emphasized the
theme of "bigness." One ad in particular had the very
word capitalized in bold face display type. Evidently
"bigness" was considered a sign of goodness and greatness
in these post-war years.
Twenty-five years ago there used to be a regular feature
in the Technic called "The Deans Page" where the dean of the
college would expound on various issues of the day. This
month's installment of the dean's message began with a
rather interesting note which graphically demonstrates the
way the times have changed. It refered to the recent U.N.
police action in Korea. "The Student and Military Prepared-
ness."
"Again many American youths face a disruption of
their carefully laid plans. A tour of duty in the military
services looms ahead for those who have not already made
a payment of Uncle Sam on the debt they owe for the
opportunities open to youth of this country." Would you
buy a used Ford from that man?
On the same note, the editorial in that issue had some-
thing to say concerning military service, this time from a
student's perspective. To sum up the drift of the editorial,
the writer was of the opinion that engineering students
should be granted deferments from military service until
they graduate because their "precious skills" were needed
for developing weapons and defense mechanisms. Perhaps
he was serious or perhaps he was looking for a way of
avoiding the front lines. In either case, no one seems to be
worried about being connected with an institution designed
to kill people.
A comforting notice appeared in an ad from Standard
Oil of Indiana. It read as follows:
"Will we ever run out of gas?"
"Running out of crude oil that powers and lubricates
our civilization is not an immediate danger . . . Standard
Oil already known how to make high-quality gasoline from
coal or oil shale. The supply of these raw materials is far
greater than the reserves of petroleum."
Feel better?

In the near future,
American industry
must solve four
critical problems.
At Babcock &amp; Wilcox, you can work on any one of them.
Where there's action, there's
opportunity. As an involved
technological leader, Babcock
&amp; Wilcox offers quick respon-
sibility in many of today's areas
of major concern.
Energy shortage. One of
the world's leading producers
of specialty steel tubing for oil
production and refining and
a major manufacturer of nu-
clear and fossil-fuel systems,
B&amp;W is also working on fuel
alternatives such as coal gasi-
fication.
Environmental control.
This is an important area of
business at B&amp;W. We produce
fuel injection systems and pre-
cipitators to make combustion
and its products cleaner; huge
boilers that run on refuse;
specialty valves which control
noise pollution.
Productivity. B&amp;W safety
and control systems and auto-
mated machines help people
in many industries work more
efficiently.
Inflation. The fight against
inflation starts with greater
productivity; B&amp;W heat-saving
refractories, machine tools and
computerized control systems
help supply it. And B&amp;W's
experience as a pioneer in
boilers and nuclear steam sys-
tems helps produce efficient
power for scores of utilities
throughout the country.
In short, with over $1 billion
in shipments a year, B&amp;W can
put you to work in a number of
vital areas.
We need creative people
who can handle responsibility
early. People who can help run
a company with the most
demanding standards of
management and engineering.

(An Interview With The President)
CONRAD: Mr. President just what do you mean when you say
Engineering Council does good work?
PRESIDENT: Conrad, I'm glad you asked that. As you know
Engineering Council is the student government of the
Engineering College. We serve the students the best
way we know how. Our way of serving the students
is as follows: representing students at faculty
meetings; sponsoring social events (TG's); doing
whatever else we can to improve student life.
CONRAD: With all this "good work" you should be happy, so
why aren't you smiling?
PRESIDENT: Well, Conrad, I'm not happy! There are many pro-
jects that we just can't undertake because we don't
have enough members.
CONRAD: Then you need more members?
PRESIDENT: Right you are, Conrad. But we understand that
engineering students are busy. Yet, what the students
don't know is that our work takes at most one hour
a week.
CONRAD: That doesn't seem like too much time at all. Then
how does one become a member?
PRESIDENT: It's really simple, Conrad. Any engineering student
is welcome to join. All he or she has to do to become
a member is to come to 2 out of 3 consecutive
meetings.
CONRAD: Any undergraduate engineering student?
PRESIDENT: Anyone!
CONRAD: When and where are your meetings held?
PRESIDENT: Once again Conrad I'm glad you asked me that. Our
meetings are on alternate Wednesday nights at 7 P.M.
in 3201 EE. We will have meetings on Oct. 8 and 22,
Nov. 5 and 19, and on Dec. 3.
CONRAD: Well, Mr. President, we are just about out of space, so,
if you don't have anything else to say .. .
PRESIDENT: Well Conrad, I do. I want the folks out there to
know who to contact if they have any questions. We
do good work!

Moving phone calls
bit by bit.
To meet the growing demand for communica-
tions facilities, the people at Western Electric
and Bell Labs have developed digital
techniques, which dramatically increase the number
of phone calls that can be carried over existing wires.
In digital communications, a voice signal is
sampled 8,000 times a second. Each sample
represents the amplitude of the voice's wave pattern
on a scale from 1 to 256.This measurement is coded
in binary form as a series of pulses or "bits."
And the code is transmitted to the receiving end
where it's decoded to faithfully recreate the voice.
Because this is a sampling technique, the pulses
representing a number of voice signals can be
interleaved. For example, the T1 System, work-
horse of the Bell System's evolving digital
network, transmits 24 simultaneous conversations
on two pairs of wire.
Development of digital techniques has
demanded close coordination between designer
and manufacturer. Interleaving 24 conversations
on wire pairs originally intended to carry a
single voice signal meant designing the T1
System to fit the characteristics of cable already
in place. It meant manufacturing components
that operate with clockwork precision, since
the system must transmit a "bit" precisely every
648 nanoseconds. (The time it takes light to
travel about 650 feet.) And because the stream
of pulses must be regenerated at about one mile
intervals—often in manholes under busy city
streets-the components must be extremely stable.
Engineers at Western Electric's plant in
Massachusetts are working with Bell Labs on a
wide range of design and manufacturing innova-
tions. For example, previous timing circuits used in
the regenerator for the T1 System were tuned
manually. Western Electric engineers have
developed a computerized process that
tunes the circuits faster and more accurately.
Meanwhile, Bell Labs has developed even
higher capacity digital systems.The latest
can interleave 4,032 simultaneous conver-
sations on a pair of coaxial conductors.
Benefit: Digital communications
techniques are one more way the
Bell System is working to meet
your communications needs
reliably and economically.

The T1 System samples 24

The timing circuit is an
inductor-capacitor It is brought
to a specific frequency by
abrading the exposed elec-
trode of the thick-film capaci-
tor. A computer controls the
process by measuring the
frequency of the timing circuit
during trimming.
The automatically ad-
justed timing circuit helps
make the latest regenerator
smaller, less expensive
and even more reliable
than its predecessors.

Ever since Thomas Edison helped
start our business, GE has been known as an innovator.
Today, more than eve;*, we need original thinkers to
help keep that kind of thinking going. Not only
engineers who can invent products. Just as impor-
tant, engineers who can help find better ways to
design them, manufacture them, market and
service them.
With so many problems today in areas like
energy, the environment, and productivity, the
challenges to technology have rarely been greater.
And few companies can offer you more ways to
help solve these problems than General Electric.
At GE you might help build better mass-
transit systems. Or cleaner, quieter jet engines.
Or you might go to work on nuclear power
projects. Or more efficient turbine-generators.
Or maybe one day work on one of the devel-
oping energy technologies like the fast-breeder
reactor. Coal gasification. Solar heating. Battery
storage for peaking power. Laser applications for
fusion and fuel enrichment.
Or perhaps work on sophisticated diagnostic medical
devices. Or engineering plastics like our virtually
unbreakable Lexan® resin. GE is big in lots of areas you
might not have known about.
But a word about that word "big." Some people worry
that General Electric might be too big for them.
Actually we're not like some big companies. We're decen-
tralized. Into strategic business units. Each with its own
plans and business objectives.
The whole idea is to give everyone plenty of responsibility
and plenty of room to try new ideas. And when you look at our record
of innovation and growth, you can see that it works.

Who've been Living and Breathing
Physics, Math, Engineering.
When you begin your search for an
interesting job, what will you be looking for?
A job that will let you put all those science,
math and engineering courses to work? A job that
will challenge you, right off, with a program of
extremely advanced technical training, and then
with almost immediate responsibility?
Would a job that promises that you won't see
much of a desk interest you? A job that holds the
offer of steady advancement? A sense of pride and
accomplishment?
Would Nuclear Power
Sound Interesting?
Of course, we're aware that a good many
seniors don't start thinking seriously about a job
until later in the year.
But if you didn't know about our program
until then, it might be too late. Our program last
year was two-thirds filled by the end of April; many
men selected after that had to wait. A few
highly-qualified men who applied after graduation
had to be turned away.
We want to give every qualified man a fair
chance at our program and the job it leads to. So,
if what we tell you sounds interesting, we urge
you to act quickly.
The name of the program is the Navy's
Nuclear Power Program.
Comprehensive. Rigorous.
The first thing you should know about the
Navy's Nuclear Power Program is that it is
probably the most comprehensive training avail-
able in the nuclear field.
The second thing you should know about it
is that it is probably the most rigorous. Since we
expect you to begin doing the job we need you for
as quickly as possible, it is an accelerated program.
The hours are long. The work difficult.
But, if you're the kind of man who will find
our program interesting, you're used to this
kind of personal challenge. You have regularly
chosen the most difficult academic programs
available because they promised the potential for
exciting achievement.
But you must also be a man who possesses a
unique sense of dedication. For, once you have
completed our program, you are placed in a
position of responsibility quickly, as an Officer in
the United States Navy.
Within a year, you could be in charge of the
supervision, operation and maintenance of a
division of the reactor plant on a nuclear-powered
surface ship or submarine.
What Else You Should Know:
1. We turn down most applicants. More than two
thirds of this country's nuclear reactors are run
by Navy men. Those in charge must possess such
a unique blend of intelligence, capability,
flexibility and dedication that passing written and
physical examinations is not enough. Each and
every qualified applicant is interviewed by the
Director, Division of Naval Reactors, in
Washington, D.C. Those who make it join a very
small community of excellence.
2* We also have openings for instructors.
Because of the nature of our program, we use only
our own instructors— not civilians. If anything,
those who apply to be instructors must be even
better qualified, academically, than the Nuclear
Officer Candidates.
An interesting job. A job that lets you do the
things you know you do well.
If that's the payoff you'd like from all your
years of study and work, find out more about the
Navy's Nuclear Power Program from the Navy's
Officer Programs Officer when he visits your
campus. Or, for even faster action, call the
following toll-free number-800-841-8000-
anytime, day or night.
It could be the most important phone call of
your life.

Announcing a major
development in fire fighting.
Faster water.
Fighting a fire is fighting time.
Every minute wasted may cost
thousands of dollars in property
destroyed. Every second saved may
be a life.
And yet, a fire fighter can't al-
ways move as fast as he would like.
Because his basic weapon, the
2!/2-inch fire hose, when full of
water, is about as hard and unyield-
ing as a steel pipe. The only way to
bend it around a corner is to shut
the water off.
And to lug it up a flight of stairs
is a test of any man's stamina.
All of this makes it easy to un-
derstand why a Union Carbide
product called UCAR Rapid Water
Additive is revolutionizing fire
fighting.
Rapid Water Additive mixes
easily with water and makes it flow
faster through a hose by reducing
friction.
Because the water flows faster,
fire fighters can get just as much
water as before using a smaller 1%-
inch hose that weighs half as much.
The smaller hose makes a much
better weapon. It bends around cor-
ners. It can be carried up a stairway
fully charged. In short, it helps fire-
men get water to the fire faster.
At the same time, it makes their
job safer and less strenuous.
Rapid Water Additive was in-
vented by Union Carbide and per
fected in cooperation with the New
York City Fire Department.
It's already helping fire fighters
do their job more efficiently in
many American cities.
Yours may be one—now or soon.

THIS MONTH'S TECHNIC
^

It's a bird! No, it's a plane! No, it's Randy Warsaw!
Higher than a kite, the Technic takes to the skys this
month with the lead article entitled "The Ups and Downs
of Hang-gliding." Randy is a Nuclear Engineering Junior
who has come out of the dark room long enough to submit
this article. This is Randy's first year with the Technic,
emigrating across the office from Datum. He has done a bit
of hang-gliding himself and knows both the ups and
downs ....
For as long as man has existed he has longed to soar with
the birds. Hang-gliding is the closest man has ever come to
soaring like the birds. As one of the newest sports around
it is a quickly growing one despite the well publicized
dangers. The lure of free flight understandably manages
to draw participants in spite of the perils. For those who are
tempted to take to wing and follow the birds south this
winter Randy has a few words of advice.
Some night, without warning, when sound asleep or
perhaps returning from a long night at the Grad Library
you may find yourself completely surrounded by a
notorious group of hooded maniacs who proceed to
silently whisk you away. It sounds like fantasy but it does
happen. This group which confronts innocent engineering
students in such a covert manner, call themselves Vulcans
for no particularly good reason. To the average student the
most prominent sign of their existence is the anvil with
their name inscribed mounted on a concrete pedestal near
the arch. The select few who's fate it is to be chosen for
the infamous initiation rights experience a much more
graphic proof of their existence not to be forgotton
quickly. In an unprecedented move toward openness
the Grand Imperial Vulcan allowed Your's Truly to
interview his Imperialness for the Technic. I have recounted
this most extraordinary occurrence with the kind permission
of the Vulcans for your enjoyment and information.
It may seem at times that the people at the North Cam-
pus Computing Center are playing musical computers.
However, it is encouraging to know that the Computing
Center plans on keeping the present machine, for a few
years anyway. In search of just what exactly was happening
at the Computing Center, Alex Pittman boarded the North
Campus bus to do some investigating. Not only did Alex
find out what was going on up there but he ended up with
the entire scoop on the technical aspects of the new
machine, too. This latest machine was designed by the same
man responsible for the old machine although it is made by
a different manufacturer. It is reported to be one of the
first production models of its type and represents the latest
in computer technology. Alex is also new to the staff this
year and this is his first effort for the magazine. Alex is a
Junior in Computer Engineering.
Ray Barry has plunked out another sequel to the con-
tinuing drama entitled "50 and 25 Years Ago." Ray has
looked at issues of the Technic from 1925 and 1950 and
reports on his findings.

our chemists went to work.
It was the worst communications fire in U.S. history.
The blaze, in one of the world's largest telephone
switching centers, silenced more than 170,000
phones covering a 300-block area of New York City.
But while the fire was still burning out of control,
the Bell System mobilized to restore service, and
people from the New York and other Bell System
companies, AT&amp;T, Western Electric and Bell Labs
jumped in to help. People like Barbara Reagor
and Doug Sinclair.
Barbara, who is working toward her master's
in chemistry, and Doug, who received his Ph.D.
in chemistry in 1972, are part of a team of Bell Labs
materials researchers. They specialize in telephone
equipment problems caused by contaminants in
the environment, flooding and fires.
In this case the problem was caused by smoke-
deposited on switching equipment contacts-that
would interfere with the electrical continuity
needed to make telephone connections.

In the laboratory, Barbara used a scanning electron
microscope with an X-ray fluorescence detector to
analyze samples of the smoke deposits. And at the fire
site, Doug collected samples and tested methods of
removing the smoke from the contacts. The answer:
dissolving the deposits with trichloroethane. This
procedure was used by craftspeople to clean the more
than six million switching contacts in the building.
The fire is already history. Telephone service was
restored in just over three weeks-a task that
ordinarily would have taken over a year. It was an
achievement made possible by the combined resources
and teamwork of the Bell System-including
people like Barbara Reagor
and Doug Sinclair.

North Campus, Engineering, and the Real World
Imagine if you will a world in which you actually have
time to do something other than study. Unfortunately,
for most of us this world does not exist without some
sacrifice in grade point or credit hour. Rare is the 4.0
engineering student who is involved in extracurricular
activities and also has a part time job. Granted there are
a few, but not many. In effect what we have here at the
College of Engineering is an educational system that
requires its students to live "outside" of society for
four years. Is this college producing engineers who,although
being well trained, have lived the last four years of their
lives in a void? Is the greater portion of our contact with
what's happening in the "outside" world through our
weekly subscriptions to Newsweek or whatever? Now
many of us have missed out on history being made
because we were too busy trying to beat out the other
guy with respect to the almighty grade point.
Some comments that are often heard in the student
sector are: "Professors don't take 'C students seriously"
and "My program advisor won't let me take this course
because he says that I don't need it". "Thou shalt not
take less than twelve credit hours" seems to be the
first law of the engineering student according to some
program advisors. The responsibility for this disharmony can
not be put on one person or group of persons. The responsi-
bility rests on the educational system itself. It is a bad
situation.
How will the college's planned move to North campus
affect the above situation? Every rational student should
indeed give this some thought. Why are we moving is a
question that everybody should ask themselves just once.
How will the move affect your lifestyle, your daily routine
(pretend that your going to be around)? Remember
no more V-Bell, Mr. Tony's, Brown Jug, etc. After you
have thought it over try this experiment: Take the
bus to North campus twice daily for a week, pretend
that you have a large program to run (if you don't, that is)
and try taking the bus back to central campus at three in
the morning. There are many flaws to a North campus
sort of lifestyle once you sit down and think about it.
How will the said move to North campus affect our
relationship with the rest of the university? Our relationship
with society once we graduate? The move will obviously
sever us completely from the college of Literature, Science
and the Arts. No more Diag, Michigan Union, or Angell
Hall. Engineering students will almost certainly be taking
less LS&amp;A classes. We will not be exposed to as many
LS&amp;A students, hence we will be living in more of a
social and academic vacuum than we already are. We
will be separated from the people with whom we are
going to deal with in the real world. Michigan engineering
students will make better trained, less well rounded
engineers who will have to relearn how to deal with the
real world. We'd better look before we leap.

The Ups And Downs Of Hang-Gliding
by Randy Warsaw
You look at your telltale, staring for what seems like
hours. That fourty pound weight of the glider is compress-
ing your shoulders. Then the telltale, a thin plastic
streamer attached to the nose of the kite, indicates the
winds are perfect. A short run down a steep incline, and
you are airborn. A feeling of freedom surrounds you. You
are bird/ike.
Hang gliding is one of the fastest growing sports in
America today. It is a sport in which your life and well-being
depends on your equipment, coordination, and knowledge.
Hang gliding is not a sport that one should expect to learn
in one day, it takes time to develop the coordination.
There are two different types of glider, the fixed wing
and the Rogallo wing. The fixed wing is almost a direct
copy of the early gliders. Most fixed wing gliders have the
traditional Bernoulli airfoil for the wing and stabilizer, they
have rudders for directional control. The newer design, more
expensive fixed wings, have a reflexed wing thatmakesthe
stabilizer and rudder unnecessary. The Rogallo wing (kite)
was developed for NASA for use as a re-entry vehicle. The
wing takes a shape when air fills a Dacron sail, this glider
consists of two tubes connected in a V called leading
edges. The name leading edges is used because these edges
are the first to come in contact with the airflow. A keel
tube is connected to the center of the V and is used for a
control bar connection and to suspend the pilot in a harness
from the center of gravity of the kite. A cross tube is used
to maintain an angle in the other tubes. It is perpendicular
to the keel tube. A Dacron sail is attached to the tubes.
A control bar is a triangle made of alumnium tubing and is
the only control the pilot has to worry about. The airshape
of the kite in the air is determined by the kingpost and
several cables. The kingpost is a small tube that comes
directly out from the middle of the keel tube. It is pointed
straight up.
The controls of a Rogallo are simple. One must maintain
a speed (air speed) above the stall speed (approx. fifteen
miles per hour). Air speed means the velocity of air
passing over the wings. In a fifteen mile per hour wind a run
of a few miles per hour is all that is needed. Very few hu-
mans are capable of running fifteen miles per hour with
forty pounds of glider on their back, therefore, windless
days make it very hard to get airborn and impossible to
stav airborn.

should be blowing directly up the hill. Lift comes from
wind that has been reflected off the hill. Hold the glider
with the nose to just above the horizon. When the wind
speed picks up, start running and move the control bar for-
ward to fill the sail and gain lift. As the glider lifts the control
bar is brought back toward the body to increase the velocity
of the glider. As one picks up flying speed altitude must be
sacrificed. One must try to avoid two dangers, the stall and
the dive. The stall is far more dangerous to life and equip-
ment. A stall is when the forward velocity is below the stall
speed and some times becomes a negative value. This
is a type of backwards flight into the hill. To survive a stall,
a pilot must force the nose downward by pulling the control
bar back all the way. After air speed resumes, the stall condi-
tion no longer exists. Sometimes a dive will result. A dive
is a rate of decent that is faster than the pilot desires. Dive
speeds have approached forty miles per hour. The remedy
for a dive is to get the nose up, thus dropping the speed
and gaining the altitude. Stalls may result. Both stalls and
dives are very hard on the fragile bones (tubes) and skin
(Dacron) of a glider. Stalls of one wing tip are also possible
during turns. Broken leading edges usually result. During
the one wing tip stall, the wing that stalls drops lower than
the keel tube.
Kite size depends on pilot weight and the winds that are
desired to fly.

These are typical wing loadings for a Rogallo. For light
wind sailing one pound per square foot is ideal. For moderate
winds 1.25 pounds per square foot is desireable. The larger
the wing area, the slower the kite behaves.
Tow kites, are the kites that are towed behind a ski
boat. They are available but cost more. The tow variety are
smaller and heavier due to the much greater stress involved.
The heavy frame and small wing area make the tow kites
almost unsuitable for foot launched flights. They are hard
to get up and impossible to keep up in any wind less than
a gale. Due to the handling characteristics of tow kites, they
are fun in high winds of around thirty-five to forty miles
per hour.
When shopping for a glider, one should be careful and
shop wisely. A too large or too small of a wing can be a
regal pain. Most people assume the bigger the better, but if
one weighs a hundred pounds and purchases an eighteen
foot kite a four or five mile per hour wind will blow he or
she on his or her respective rear end. On the other hand, the
real jocks might choose a cut keel (high performance wing
with the same wingspan but a shorter keel) and find it too
hard to control or too fast for sport flying. Shop around,
talk to experienced people, and fly in a well taught repu-
table school before purchasing.

his hand at longer flights and even soaring. Soaring is a
condition in which the lift of the wing in moderate winds is
equal if not greater than the sink rate of the glider. The
sink rate of the wing is a characteristic of the semipermiable
nature of the dacron sail. When a fine wind exists and with
a good slope a pilot is capable of soaring for hours with an
altitude of over five hundred feet. A flier will fly back and
forth across a ridge gaining altitude with each pass. This
violates the number one rule of most pilots. NEVER FLY
HIGHER THAN YOU WOULD CARE TO FALL! Other
sensible rules are:
Learn to fly at a reputable school.
Fly only the winds you can handle.
Fly only the hills you can handle.
Check the aircraft to make sure it is airworthy.
Wear a helmet.
In the halls of the Engineering Buildings there have been
rumors of a foolish N.E. junior that went on an outing with
two other students. It was a bright sunny Thursday with a
ten mph breeze blowing off Lake Michigan. In his haste
to fly this semi-experienced flier neglected to check his
rigging and airworthyness of the glider. This mistake resul-
ted in an improper airshape, a dive, quickly approaching
pavement, blood, a pleasant afternoon spent in the Niles
hospital for the treatment of multiple cuts and abrasions,
and a lot of money spent to repair the kite.
Michigan has some very fine hang gliding areas, espe-
cially in the west shoreline. This is due to the steady winds
that blow from Lake Michigan and the sand dunes. Some of
the fine areas in this state are, Warren Dunes St. Pk.,
Pyramid Pt., Frankfort, and North Shore.

The Latest In Computer Technology
by Alexis J. Pittman
TECHNOLOGY
The AMDAHL 470v/6 computing system uses large-
scale integration (LSI) semiconductor technology to obtain
high reliability and speeds measured in trillienths of a second.
An LSI version of bipolar emitter-coupled logic (ECL) is
used throughout the central processing unit (CPU). Metal
exide semiconductor (MOS) LSI circuits are used in main
memory and ultra high-speed bipolar components and are
used for the buffer cache memory.
Dr. Gene M. Amdahl custom-designed the CPU circuits,
using emitter-coupled logic with speeds on the LSI chip on
the order of 600 piceseconds. The resultant CPU cycle time
is 32 nanoseconds.
The AMDAHL 470V/6 Computer is an air cooled system
thus lowering the space requirement of an installed system
vs. that of a liquid cooled system.
One of the more interesting parts of the AMDAHL
47O//6 support equipment is the Operator's Console
(System Console). This unique piece of equipment con-
tains an independent NOVA minicomputer with 32k-word
memory, a disk storage device, a tape cassette drive device,
a modem, a CRT display terminal and an Operator control
panel. The console has a direct computer-to-console inter-
face to permit static readout of over 16,000 system latches
and setting of certain data and control registers.
The console can operate in three distinct modes, which
are: a device support mode, hardware command mode, and
maintenance mode.
The more interesting mode of operation is the Mainten-
ance Mode and the Hardware Command Mode. In Mainten-
ance Mode, the NOVA minicomputer can perform diagnos-
tic tests that are stored on NOVA.'s disk on the main
computer under the operator's command. In this mode of
operation, the NOVA system can test and display status of
over 16.000 latches in the main computer. In Command
Mode, the console governs a variety of functions within
AMDAHL System hardware.
CPU-MAIN STORAGE SYSTEM
The AMDAHL 470v/6 consists of four logical, indepen
dent units. These four units are the instruction unit (l-Unit),
which implements the pipeline, the execution unit (E-Unit),
which performs arithmetic and logical instructions; the
storage unit (S-Unit), which controls the high-speed buffer
and main memory requests; and the channel unit (C-Unit),
which executes channel commands.
INSTRUCTION UNIT
The instruction unit pipeline performs instruction fetching
and decoding and coordinates the execution of an operation
with the other units. Since the l-Unit is principally devoted
to controlling instruction execution, it must handle and
resolve priorities like interrupts; status switching; CPU-
channel control interface requirements, and scratch, general
purpose and floating point register requests from the E-Unit.
The CPU contains sixteen general purpose registers,
eigth floatingpoint registers, eight scratch pad registers and
eight control registers that are under direct control of the
l-Unit. The l-Unit controls all reading and writing of data
to and from these registers.
A typical RX-type instruction execution sequence in the
l-Unit pipeline is illustrated in Figure 1. Each individual
instruction's execution is divided into six phases plus the
initial fetch phase, called the l-Fetch phase. The l-Fetch
phase begins with the l-Unit requesting the S-Unit priority
in the l-cycle. A high-speed buffer access is initiated in the
B1 cycle, and the instruction word becomes available in the
B2 cycle from the buffer. Now with the instruction word
fetched from the buffer, the l-Unit begins instruction
interpretation. The next phase is called the Phase-A.
Phase-Aconsistsof an instruction decode and general purpose
register read cycle. Since RX-type instructions have an
operand address consisting of the contents of at least one
reqister plus some modification, the register reads are done

at this time by the l-Unit. Phase-B then generates the operand
address using the effective address generator, (operand
address of the instruction plus the base register are usually
added together for the effective address), and initiates
a buffer read using the computed effective address. This
request may be four or eight bytes, depending upon the
instruction type. In branch instructions, the location of the
branch is requested such that both paths are available, this
insures that the pipeline processing doesn't stop and waste
extra processing cycles, waiting for the conditional-branch
instruction to determine the path that will be chosen. After
the branch instruction has been processed and the branch
determined, the branch-not-taken path continues to be
fetched and decoded, but are not executed. This process
"dries-up" after the first instructions in the pipeline of the
path-taken are completely executed.
After data has become available from the S-Unit in
Phase-C, the l-Unit passes this data to the E-Unit to begin
processing it. The E-Unit sets early condition codes at the
end of the El cycle, thus speeding the process for the l-Unit
for determining the proper path for branches before in-
struction completion. Phase D is the second cycle (and
subsequent cycles for long operations, like divide, etc.) of
the E-Unit execution. In Phase F, the l-Unit checks the re-
sults of the E-Unit from the Phase E cycle and does the
final update and writing of results in Phase F if no error is de-
tected from the E-Unit.
Since no results are stored in the data registers until the
Phase F, but are retained in temporary storage and in in-
ternal buffers, the AMDAHL 470v/6 has the unique ability
to process interrupts fast. When an interrupt occurs, the
pipeline can be immediately cleared (except for an in-
struction in the Phase F.then it is permitted to finish) and
*e next instruction's address in the pipeline to complete
execution is saved, permitting instruction processing to re-
start at point of interrupt.
EXECUTION UNIT
The AMDAHL 470V6 execution unit consists of many
major functional components, registers for data storage and
control logic for the coordination of the functional units
during instruction execution.
The l-Unit controls the E-Unit and tells the E-Unit when
to start operation and supplies intermediate scratch space
for long operations (like MULTIPLY EXTENDED).
Data is presented from the l-Unit to E-Unit through the
logical unit and checker, called "LUCK". LUCK scans oper-
ands for any information that can be obtained before execu-
tion actually begins by performing the following functions:
LOGICAL OPERATIONS (AND, OR Exclusive OR)
OPERAND COMPARISON (Magnitude of two operand is
compared)
SETTING EARLY CONDITION CODES
PARITY CHECK (Input parity is checked and predicted)
DECIMAL DIGIT CHECK (Input data is check for valid
digits and sign)
BIT COUNTER
The LUCK unit helps give the E-Unit a "head-start" for
certain operations. The in.. .Jon generated from the
LUCK unit and control information from the l-Unit
initialize the E-Unit processing.
The principal E-Unit functional units are multiplier,
adder, shifter and byte mover. Each functional unit is able
to perform its function in one machine cycle (32 nano-
second). Error checking is done in all functional units. Out-
put data is checked for good parity and overflow conditions.
STORAGE CONTROL UNIT
All storage requests from the CPU and channels are
processed by the storage unit. The storage unit accepts
addresses from the l-Unit or the channel unit returns data
to the l-Unit, channel unit or the execution unit. Priorities
are resolved and facilities are provided bases on the S-Unit's
internal priority structure and the priority of the request
from the l-Unit or channel unit. The S-Unit also deter-
mines whether requested data comes directly from the high-
speed buffer or must come from main storage. The S-Unit
performs all virtual-to-real address translations. The virtual
address implementation in the AMDAHL 470v/6 follows
the System/370 architure, but performance is further en-
hanced with a high-speed translation look-up buffer and a
segment table origin stack.
HIGH-SPEED BUFFER
The AMDAHL 470V/6 high-speed buffer is organized as
a 16,384-byte set-associative memory consisting of primary
and alternative halves. Each half contains 256 32-byte lines
that can be accessed on a double or single word basis. The
buffer cycle time matches that of the CPU (32 nano-seconds)
plus enhancing the pipeline technology of the AMDAHL
machine.
A line (32 byte in size) can be put in the buffer from
main storage in about 150 nano-seconds. After a line has
been put in the buffer, any access to that data in the buffer
such as read or store command doesn't require a reference
to main memory for updating. Thus, frequently referenced
data may be accessed many times without updating main
storage. Any buffer line that has been modified by a mem-
ory reference instruction, is marked as modified, and main

storage control unit.
MAIN MEMORY
A two megabyte system is four-way interleaved, thus
when a request for data from main memory is made, a line
of 32-bytes is referenced. Maximum interleaving allows as
many as four 32-byte storage accesses to be overlapped
for an eight megabyte system. So, a four megabyte system
allows two 32-byte storage accesses to be overlapped. At the
maximum data transfer rate, two lines are transferred from
main memory to the high-speed buffer in approximately
300 nanoseconds.
If a two megabyte storage unit should develop an un-
correctable error, it is possible to configure out the mega-
byte containing the error. The remaining good megabyte
can then be used as a one-megabyte storage unit, thus in-
creasing the system availability.
The AMDAHL 470v/6 System includes error checking
and correction that permits automatic correction of all

Amdahl at U of M
The following are excerpts from an interview with
Director of the Computing Center, Dr. Robert Bartel.
Technic: Does the University own the Amdahl machine?
Dr. Bartel: The University has entered in a purchase agree-
ment for the Amdahl, in which we will own the
machine on completion of payments. The
Amdahl machine is financed with an installment
plan that will cover a six year period.
Technic: Is the Amdahl system cost effective compared
to the 370/168?
Dr. Bartel: The Amdahl machine is more cost effective of
the two machines if you compare the relative
speed of the two machines, the relative cost of
two compatible systems and the potential of
growth in the Amdahl vs. that of the IBM
370/168.
Technic: Is the cost of the Amdahl system and the IBM
370/168 in a compatible configuration about
equal or very close?
Dr. Bartel: Yes, very close, if you consider financing of
both of the machines as we had configured the
370/168. When you talk about the 370/168,
you must ask what is the configuration of that
machine, how many channels, how much main
memory you are going to require, and looking
at cost efficiency, we ask the question what is
the cost to us over the long range period, namely
six years, of an Amdahl machine with four
megabyte memory and a 370/168 with four
megabyte memory and eight channels. Now that
is the minimum configuration for the IBM
370/168 that we felt would be reasonable for
the period of the time under consideration. The
Amdahl machine that we're comparing it with
has sixteen channels as a standard configuration,
so in that sense, it has growth capabilities
beyond that of the eight channel configuration
of the 370/168 which was considered the
minimum acceptable 370/168 configuration.
That, with the relative pricing, proved to be
the factors that were considered in the price/
performance study that was conducted.
Technic: Do you expect the Amdahl system to handle
the system load two, four, and six years from
now?
Dr. Bartel: We are assuming that the system will handle the
load through the six year financing period, under
the conditions that we increase the memory
capacity from the present two megabytes, to
three megabytes next year, four megabytes the
year after and possibly extend it beyond that if
there is need of more memory. There is at the
present the expectation that a four megabyte
system with the difference of the order of
speed of 1.5, 1.6, and 1.7, these figures are all
reasonable figures to apply to the difference of
the 168 and the Amdahl machine, that would
enable us to live through the six years.
Technic: Does the center plan an increase in disk storage?
Dr. Bartel: Presently the total capacity of the I.T. disk
system is 2.4 billion bytes of storage. We have
gone through an extensive review of equipment
available, making price comparison of several
equipment vendors and made the decision on
the system rented by Storage Technology Corp.
and that will have the total capacity of 3
billion bytes when installed this November.
Technic: Will this increase in disk storage meet the ex-
pected growth of mass storage requirements of
the next six years of the Amdahl system?
Dr. Bartel: No, the rental of the disk system is a two year
agreement, during which we can upgrade the
equipment. There are plans, that S.T. had for
increasing the capacity of the same equipment
we will have on the floor by a factor of 1/3.
This would rise disk storage close to four
billion bytes.
Technic: The number of MTS users are growing, is this
a growth in any particular area?
Dr. Bartel: The use of the machine has been on an increase
greater than the growth of University students.
Social science use of the machine has been on a
noticeable increase. With the introduction of
MTS, use of terminals, and conversational
languages available, the use of the system is made
more attractive to fields like social science and
education.

INCORPORATED
An equal opportunity employer


by Mutad Cinhcet
What you are about to read is one of the strangest ex-
periences of my college career. After many unanswered re-
quests, I was finally able to receive an interview with the
Grand Imperial Vulcan (GIV) - the head of Vulcans, that
secret engineering society. I received a letter instructing me
to be at the Vulcan's anvil behind West Engineering the
next evening from where I would be led to the GIV. So
clutching my pad and pencil, I set out to set the record
straight on this mysterious organization.
I arrived at the anvil at the appointed time. It was quiet
on the diag as most people had already deserted the Ugli
for home or the V-Bell. Suddenly the stillness of the night
was broken by the roar from within the West Engin Arch
and I turned to see a badly rusted '63 Chevy pull up along
side me. The driver, his face hidden by a black hood, leaned
out of his window and yelled, "Hey, are you the one from
the Technic?" . . I was a little bit stunned but I finally ad-
mitted that I was the one he was looking for. Once my
identity was clear, two more hooded figures emerged from
the back seat and informed me that if I wanted an audience
with the GIV, I must be blindfolded and led to his secret
sanctuary. By now the two Old Milwaukee's I'd downed
were resting fairly well so I figured I'd play along with their
game. I didn't want to risk losing this interview, and besides,
how often do you get to drive through the Arch?
The drive was unexpectedly long and the walk seemed
even longer, as I was led blindfolded into a building and then
up and down stairways and along endless corridors. I was
thoroughly confused and becoming more annoyed by the
minute when I was informed that we had finally arrived
at the secret sanctuary.
My blindfold was removed and as I stood blinking in the
dim light; a most unusual scene appeared before me. It was
in a large room containing an enormous oval table. At the
center of the table was a glowing red anvil. This and a few
flickering candles afforded the only light. At the opposite
end of the table, robed in the now familiar black cloak and
hood, sat the Grand Imperial Vulcan. The three people who
had brought me there faded into the background and I was
left face to face with the GIV. He took a drink from a can
he was holding and gestured for me to sit before him. What
follows is an account of the interview.
I: I've put up with about all I can take. Now just what. .
Voices from background: SILENCE!'You have not been
given permission to speak.
GIV: We have granted you this unprecedented interview in
an effort to combat bad publicity. It is our wish that
the location of this room, the identity of the members
and especially the identity of the GIV remain secret.
If you agree to these terms we can dispense with the
usual formalities and you may ask any question you
deem appropriate.
I: I agree. For starters, just exactly who or what is
Vulcans?
GIV: Vulcans is a secret honorary engineering society made
up of juniors, seniors, and grad students. We exist only
at U of M. We elect into membership those who show
leadership and service to the College of Engineering.
I: But isn't this secrecy stuff a bit overdone with the
robes, blindfolds and all?
Voices: SILENCE! Criticism is not tolerated from non-mem-
bers.
I: Sorry! but why is there such an emphasis on secrecy?
GIV: I am pleased that you asked this question. There are
several reasons for the secrecy. The first is that we are
an honorary society where we bestow private recog-
nition on those whom we feel deserve it. We feel this
should be a personal recognition on those whom we
feel deserve it. We feel this should be a personal
recognition from the leaders of the college to other
leaders and this should not involve any public acclaim.
Secondly, we realize that there are deserving students
who are not elected to membership and we wish to
avoid insulting anyone. We do not wish any public
status connected with our organization. Thirdly, we
have 71 years of tradition to uphold. This tradition
18
Michigan Technic


we are a bit reluctant to admit to.
I: Speaking of rituals, what was it that you were doing
last spring to the people you dragged out of classes?
Five of you guys took the kid sitting next to me
right in the middle of a ME 381 hourly. He was
screaming when you separated him from hisBluebook.
A half hour later he staggered back into the classroom
trailing a river of water, beer and broken eggs. What
did he do to deserve such treatment?
GIV: You have again pleased the GIV with your question.
There are many reasons for the severity of our tapping
ritual. I suppose the most significant is the Vulcans'
pledged many decades ago to have the most severe
tappings procedure in the university. We feel the
honor bestowed is well worth the punishment.
I: Why is it worth it? What does Vulcans do besides
going around disrupting classes and trashing unsus-
pecting students?
Voices: Insolent comments from outsiders will not be
tolerated! This is your second warning!
GIV: This is exactly the kind of bad publicity we wish to
rebuke. Our tapping and initiation rituals may be
severe, and perhaps the most visible indication of
our organization's presence, but the real purpose of
Vulcans goes far beyond that. The reasons for our
existence are five fold as set forth in the Vulcan's
Statement of Purpose:
1. To promote comradeship among its members
based upon their mutual interests.
2. To develop cooperation between student or-
ganizations by promoting this friendship among
leaders.
3. To bestow private recognition upon those who
are deserving by electing them to membership.
4. To provide service to the College of Engineering
in situations where VULCANS has unique capabilities.
5. To maintain the decades of tradition on which
our organization was founded.
So you see, we intend to uphold our tradition no
matter how inappropriate it may seem to those out-
side the organization. I should make it very clear that
absolutely nothing is done to initiates that they do
not freely admit to. Our victims are entirely willing.
I: OK, so the ritual does have its place, but you have to
admit, it's not as important as the other organizational
purposesyou mentioned. For example, if a member of
Vulcans conscientiously served the organization but
would not bow to the ritualistic procedures, like,
keeping this tomb's location a secret, how would the
organization respond to him?
GIV: Fortunately this regrettable circumstance has occurred
but once. That would be the case of "Indiana Bob".
': Indiana Bob? Is that because he was from Indiana?
GIV: No, that's because his remains are scattered over the
entire state of Indiana ....
There was snickering and chuckling from voices in the
background.
I: I see. Well, getting back to the other purposes you
mentioned, you claim you provide some sort of
services to the College of Engineering. That appears
to be the only direct means of contact between
Vulcans and the student body. Just what services
do you provide?
GIV: Our organization provides both scholarship and loan
funds that are available to any engineering student.
Scholarships are awarded yearly, and awards are based
on three criteria: financial need, activities, and
scholarship. Vulcans have a loan fund available to the
student body through Ray Carroll's Office in the
Chrysler Center on North Campus. No interest loans
of up to $100 are available to those who are "caught
short."
I: A no-interest loan fund huh? That seems to be a pretty
risky venture. Has anyone ever failed to repay a
Vulcans loan?
GIV: Again, this unfortunate circumstance has occurred
but once. That was the case of "Minnesota Mike" ...
I: I think I've heard that one before. Is there anything
else you do?
GIV: Although you might not see it as a student service,
our annual ring sales serve as a source of income for
our loan and scholarship funds. So not only do stu-
dents benefit a worthy cause by purchasing their
class rings from Vulcans, but they get the only offi-
cial College of Engineering class ring, emblazoned
with a beautiful rendering of the West Engin Arch.
Say, could I interest you in this little number? White

on my HP-21 . . . Are there any other services you
provide?
GIV: Well, perhaps our greatest service is to the entire Ann
Arbor community by the fact that we keep our mem-
bers off the streets and out of the bars until at least
10PM on Monday nights. We feel this has prevented
as many as 14 rapes during the past month alone.
I: 14 rapes? That must be quite a rowdy bunch of guys
you have.
GIV: No, the guys are fairly well behaved. It's the women
who are hard to keep in line.
I: Then Vulcans does have female members. I have
heard Vulcans described as a men's senior honorary.
GIV: Yes, I am afraid that that definition does still appear
in print. It dates from the time when women engin-
eers were scarcer than a sunny day in Ann Arbor. Now
that women are assuming a prominent role in
engineering, particularly here at Michigan, Vulcans
has seen fit to accept female members who prove
themselves worthy through college oriented service.
I: Has anyone ever refused membership?
GIV: Once again this unfortunate circumstance has occurred
but once. That was the case of "Oregon Sam" . . .
I: I'm beginning to catch on . . .
GIV: Are you now? Then are you sure you wouldn't care
to purchase a class ring? They're guaranteed to fit - if
they don'tyourfinger will be adjusted absolutely free!
I: I believe that's an offer I can't refuse. I'm sure we

CHANNEL UNIT
The standard AMDAHL 470v/6 configuration provides
16 channels for attaching input/output equipment to the
system. Any equipment compatible with the System 360/370
input/output interface standard can be attached to the
AMDAHL System. Each of the 16 channels can be con-
figured as a byte multiplexer, block multiplexer or selector
channel.
A total of 1024 subchannels are available to the byte and
block multiplexer channels. Each channel can have 64, 128,
or 256 subchannels assigned to it.
An AMDAHL 470v/6 channel can support a data rate
of two megabytes per second on a one-byte interface. With
an optional two-byte interface, a four-megabyte data rate
is possible. The total instantaneous aggregate data rate for
the channel unit is approximately 16 megabytes per second.

How does the AMDAHL 470v/6 compare against other
large-scale computers that employ PIPELINE technology?

interview. I certainly have a better understanding
of Vulcans and I hope the Technic readers will also.
Just one final question - are the rumors about you
true, that the GIV can chug a pitcher of beer in just
14 seconds?
Laughter from the background.
GIV: You have once again pleased the GIV with your
question. I believe this calls for an official demonstra-
tion. The GIV will drink - but he will not drink alone.
At a signal from the GIV, two pitchers of beer were
set before us. I realized what was expected of me.
GIV: If you are ready, we will begin at the count of three.
One, Two
I don't remember much after that - I vaguely recall the
count of three. I regained consciousness, lying next to the
anvil on the diag, just in time to catch a glimpse of the GIV
driving off into the sunrise in the old Chevy. As I lay there
collecting my wits, an old man wearing sunglasses and
carrying a guitar case and a pile of T-shirts came up to me
and asked "Hey, who was that masked man?".
I replied, "I don't know, but I wanted to thank him."

50 Years Ago
The lead story of the Nov. 1925 issue of the Technic was
"Transportation In India," not a particularly exciting topic.
There is one interesting passage in light of various posi-
tions taken in American foreign policy since 1925.
The railway policy of the Government of India has
been, for a long time, a subject of considerable contro-
versy between the Indian and British publicists. The
Indian publicists almost unanimously contend that the
railroads in India, built and constructed with foreign
capital and operated and managed by foreign agents, with
no or little knowledge of local conditions, have been
economically ruinous to the country. On the other hand,
some of the British publicists maintain that the growth
of the country's foreign trade and the amount of traffic
passing on the railroads, both conclusively prove their
success.
The article does not mention what the British are getting
for their generous efforts. Isn't there something familiar
i" the attitudes of the two sides? The Indians seem to be
saying, "Take your technology and go home." The British
seem to be saying "Our technology is good for you, it will
make you big and strong." There is a mysteriously familiar
ring in these statements.
As if the Indian transportation wasn't thrilling enough,
there was "The Use Of Condensers For Correcting Power
Factor," an overwhelmingly absorbing subject as any E.C.E.
310 students will tell you. What is interesting is the fact
that what was a relatively new technique back then is taken
'or granted today.
Here is an important message for stereo shoppers that
appeared in the 1925 Technic: "Unfortunately synchronous
motors of the usual type are not practicable in sizes much
below 100 horsepower. . ." Miraculously enough, synchro-
nous motors are widely used in modern turntable design.
So if your thinking of buying a turntable be sure to have
lots of room and don't forget to get special permission
from the power company ....
From the "Oh ya, remember those!"Department:
ln a surprisingly short time the electronic calculator has
buried some traditional engineering practices. The article
Tips On Logarithms" reminds one of a time when
50 and 25
Years Ago
by Ray Barry
logarithms were found in tables and interpolation was otten
required. Who says those were the good old days?
Speaking of change, the following quote appeared in a
Rex Chain Belt Company advertisement: "It is significant
'that the one resource in which Americans have been defi-
cient - human labor - is the one resource in the utilization
of which we have made the greatest progress." Maybe it was
worth having to use log tables - at least there werejobs.
25 Years Ago
A graph appearing in the Nov. 1950 issue of the Technic
plotting the amount of money spent by outside organizations
to fund engineering research at U of M over a period of
time shows that between 1941 and 1950 investments in-
creased from .4 million to over 2.6 million dollars. That is a
2.2 million dollar increase, of that 2.2 million the U. S. gov-
ernment is singly responsible for 2.1 million. The percen-
tage of that which is related to the military was not given.
The theme of the cover was: "American industry .... the
backbone of the hope for peace." No further explanation
is given. Evidently the average reader would have under-
stood in 1950.
The following quote was taken from the editorial page:
"An all-campus poll of Michigan coeds showed that socially
engineers rated third among the colleges. Significantly,
numerous coeds stated that because engineers think of
everything in terms of the slide rule, they prove to be dull
companions." Perhaps they had the annual "Slide Rule Ball"
in mind when they made that comment. The point that the
editor was trying to make is not unfamiliar to the contem-
porary engineering student, that is: "Should we not get
something more from our years at Michigan, something
beyond the comparatively narrow confines of engineering?"
This seems to be one of those eternally asked questions.
On the Deans page of this issue Dean Crawford dealt with
another one of those perpetual questions; specialist or
generalist? One important piece of advise offered is that
"The greatest evil present in specialization from the point
of view of the engineer, particularly the young engineer, is
the manner in which it limits his bounderies and, conse-
quently, his early opportunities." How true.

The people who have been waiting for you.
Months and months ago, the group knew they
needed help. It was not easy getting the requi-
sition approved for an additional engineer. But
approved it was, and several candidates have
been considered, and a selection has been made,
and you're it.
Whatever idea you had had about how your
career would begin, these happen to be the peo-
ple who took a particular liking to you. The
boss saw that. Now prove them right.
The proper way to accomplish that is to pro-
ceed on the assumption that you have bought
into a small company in which these people are
your partners. Since Kodak is not really a small
company, you may be surprised by this advice.
Surprise is good for you at this stage of your
life. And what's good for us is when a new
engineer turns up with the attitude of a private
entrepreneur, full of ambition and schemes to
make the newly joined team look hot as a pistol.
The other way is to assume that you are just
one person among many thousands, in which
case that assumption may well prove correct.
Safer but less enjoyable.
We know whereof we speak. We are Busi-
ness and Technical Personnel, Eastman Kodak

cuss your ambitions with us? We make photo-

born to lead.
Are you the kind of engineer who has what it takes to move into management someday?
If you are, you already know it.
Now what you heed to know is which companies can offer you the best oppor-
tunities. We think you'll find General Electric is one.
We're a high technology company. And that means we have to have manag-
ers who understand technology —women and men —to run the place.
Today, over 60% of the top managers at General Electric hold technical
degrees. In fact, over 65% of the college graduates we hired last year held
technical degrees.
Of course, just leadership ability and a technical degree won't get
you into management. First, you're going to need solid engineering
experience and abroad understanding of business.
And we have a lot of ways to help you get it.
One is our Manufacturing Management Program. A two-year
program of rotating assignments that gives you broad experience
with different products and manufacturing processes.
Another is our Engineering Program. For engineers with an
interest in product and systems design and development.
There's also a Field Engineering Program, a Technical Market-
ing Program, plus a number of programs sponsored by product
operations.
And all with just one aim. To give you all the responsi-

distance and resistance.,
to help provide better rural telephone service.
Bell Labs electrical engineer Joe Nemchik, shown
checking the performance of a circuit board, was
one member of a team that tackled a major prob-
lem: telephone signals are weakened by electrical
resistance in the copper wires that connect remote
communities to switching offices. Up to now,
reducing the resistance required costly large-
diameter wires.
Joe and his colleagues designed a new electrical
circuit that both amplifies the voice signals and
strengthens the signals that set up the call's
switching path by taking advantage of the simple
fact that the talking and signaling occur at
different times.
It's an inexpensive circuit, and
deceptively simple. But getting it
simple was the hard part. Joe,
who joined Bell Labs in 1970,
had to thread his way through
conflicting requirements. The
circuit would need state-of-
the-art electronics and had to work with all
switching equipment, some 40 years old. But
high-voltage transients from older switches could
damage the new electronics. So could lightning
hits and power-line induction on rural telephone
lines. The new circuit met the requirements.
Joe and his team worked closely with Western
Electric to get the circuit to Bell telephone com-
panies quickly. Later, Joe improved the design,
cutting down the number of parts by 25 per cent.
With this circuit, Bell telephone companies
can use smaller wires, helping conserve copper
and saving about $15 million a year.
And provide our rural customers with
better telephone service as well.

This month Technic explores PI RGIM, remember them?
PIRGIM is that organization you hear about once a semester
when you go through registration. At least that was the
case until recently, now PIRGIM is that mysterious debit
which automatically appears on your bill from the Univer-
sity. Since the students at U of M contribute more than
half of PIRGIM's student based income, Technic decided
to find out what PIRGIM is or is not doing.
On November 6 Randy Warsaw, accompanied by Doug
Johnson, packed up their tape recorder and headed up to
PIRGIM headquarters in Lansing armed with questions
about PI RGIM and about some of PI RGIM's reports. Randy
had made arrangements to interview three of PIRGIM's
directors: Joseph Tuchinsky, Executive Director; Marion
Anderson, Projects Director; and Edward Petrini, Legal
Director. The article that resulted from the interview is
this month's cover story and is called, "PIRGIM: Public
Interest?" The article is a verbatim transcript of parts of the
interview. Randy is a Nuclear Engineering Junior, Doug is
an Aerospace Sophomore. Both are Technic regulars.
Professionalism in Engineering is the subject of our
second feature this month. In the past few years a move-
ment for professionalism in engineering has been gaining
support. Many engineers feel they are being exploited
by the hiring practices of employers and the treatment they
receive while on the job. The article is called, "Engineering
and Professionalism" and was written by Angelo Muzzin.
This is Angelo's first piece for the Technic. Angelo is a
Senior in Engineering Science, he has been interested in the
subject of professionalism for some time.
1-275 is a new freeway presently under construction near
Detroit which has some interesting problems and innova&lt;
tions. It is a good example of what is involved in|
building a modern highway. "1-275: An Innovative High-
way" by Pete DeCamp discusses some of the features thai
set this highway apart from others. This is Pete's first
article for the Technic.
Technic does not receive much correspondence as a
general rule, but is always glad to receive responses. This
month we received a letter from a somewhat enraged
Sophomore who addresses a pertinent problem. He has a
gripe with which most of us can identify, his letter appean
on the letters page. Where else?
Ray Barry developed a bad habit. For the third month ir
a row he has poured over ancient Technics and expoundec
on them in our column "50 and 25 Years Ago." Since Ray
is an editor they always get printed.
That's it for this month. Happy Holidays!

Letters to the Editor
To the Editor:
Since coming to the University a year ago, I've en-
countered several things that disturb me to no end. Number
one on my list is the testing techniques employed by the
Math department. On Tuesday, Oct. 21, I took another
departmental exam and to no surprise it was very similar to
the 115, 116, and 117 exams I've already encountered.
Taking exams doesn't bother me as long as I'm tested for
what I do know. The Math Department continually tests
what I don't know.
The Math Department of the University of Michigan
uses basically the same form for its midterms and finals:
True-False and Multiple Choice. Actually, a more appro-
priate name would be Multiple Guess; this would include
both the above categories. Why Multiple Guess? It's not be-
cause the questions are so outrageous but because of the
time element involved in selecting the proper answer from a
multitude of equally possible answers. It may take between
five and fifteen minutes to solve a single homework pro-
blem. The Math Department will give between twenty to
forty problems, similar to the homework problems, to solve
(answer) in one hour. The Department will argue that it
gives the answers and all the student has to do is choose the
correct one; the given answers usually differ by a sign, limit
of integration, or the slightly more obvious interchange of
sine and cosine. The most frustrating part of this lies at
the end of each list of answers: NONE OF THE ABOVE.
Why bring a pointless dimension such as this into an exam?
It would seem to have no place at all on a true test of
knowledge.
What is the problem with this type of examination?
Does it really test the student's knowledge of the material?
There are several factors involved in the ability of a math
student to succeed. First of all, students are Human Being
we are susceptible to error. We are not machines. In bein
Human we are affected by pressures, internal and exterm
The greatest pressure is brought about by the desire I
achieve and excel. The primary purpose of any exam is I
test the student's knowledge of the material. In math, it is I
test the students ability to make the proper computation
This can be subdivided into understanding the theory an
applying the theory. A secondary purpose of any exam is I
separate the better students from the average students. Th
Multiple Guess exam fails to accomplish either objective
A good math student should be able to make computatiot
without error whereas a not-so-good student may fail on
minor point. This type of exam leaves no room for erroi
The answer is either right or wrong. Here total loss c
credit, for minor infractions, is terribly unfair. What
Multiple Guess exam does test is how well one can se
through the cleverly disguised solutions and how well on
can beat the odds. The Multiple Guess math exam doesnc
test what students do know but what we do not kno*
The solution is simple. When making up the exam th
department should first consider the purpose of the exai
and then consider the students. Students are Human; w
do make mistakes. Should we be crucified for minor it
fractions? One argument that I have heard in favor of thi
type of testing is that they are easy to grade. As farasl't
concerned, that's ridiculous. The faculty of the Universit
are here, being paid, to help the students learn. If that meat
grading an exam that will benefit the student by being fat
and a better educational tool then they damn well better d
it.

Public Interest?
by Randy Warsaw and
Doug Johnson
Pirgim (Public Interest Research Group in Michigan)
has for three years been funded by the students of five
major universities while the majority of students of these
universities remained somewhat in the dark about the
group's workings and structure. Technic recently had the
opportunity to interview three of the Pirgim hierarchy. The
interview took place over lunch in Lansing. Pirgim has come
under a great deal of criticism both from the students
that support Pirgim and the students that generally do not
support the public interest organization over a new fee or
Pirgim dues collection system. This system was instituted
for the first time in Ann Arbor for the fall term of 1975.
Pirgim works inseyera[_area^_^Qrne of which are toy
safety, utility rate setting issues, safety of nuclear power,
access of citizens to Public Information, licensing of
various occupations, a roP'truth1? ^otti" ***", and various
ecological issues. Of the nine Pirgim staff members, three
were available for interview: Joseph S. Tuchinsky, the
Executive director; Ed Petrini, Pirgim's Legal director and
U of M Law School graduate and finally Marion Anderson,
Pirgim's Projects director shed a little light on her controver-
sial report dealing with nuclear power: Fallout on the
Freeway.
Technic: What is Pirgim?
Joe: Pirgim is a student created, and student controlled,
and student funded social change organization, three years
old, which got its start at the University of Michigan and has
spread state-wide, which involves students working with
their own professional staff to try to influence social
problems which students identify as their own priorities
for change.
Technic: How many Pirgim members are there?
Joe: There are forty thousand students at five Michigan
university campuses who have joined Pirgim in the sense of
contributing up to three dollars per year through the regis-
tration system at their school. There are a far smaller num-
ber of students, numbering in the hundreds or occasionally
maybe getting in the low thousands who have joined
Pirgim in the sense of participating actively with their time
and their energy and their knowledge in a project or in
communications or in the decision making structure as
board members.
Technic: By professional staff do you mean full time?
Joe: I mean the nine paid staff members who work ofr the
Pirgim office near the Capitol in Lansing.
Technic: How many issues is Pirgim currently dealing with?
Joe: We are working in about half a dozen major areas,
but we are working on a number of issues in each of those
areas as well as several issues often left over from projects
of several years ago which don't really fit into today's
priorities which we feel a responsibility to see these through
to completion. For example, one of Pirgim's very first
projects in 1972 was surveying toy stores around Christmas
to see if the Federal Toy Safety law was being violated.
In terms of today's priorities, that does not seem like
quite as big an undertaking as utility intervention, nuclear
power and action on unemployment problems, but we none-
theless see a duty to follow it through. Our project resulted
in both a successful federal lawsuit, forcing the federal
government to institute better rules and a successful legis-
lation effort in Lansing whereby the state government
adopted a toy safety law. But we still feel an obligation to
monitor the state agency to see to it that it's going tc
enforce the law. And we continue into this fall to stay in
touch with the state agency to find out what enforcement
plans it has and how adequate they are, although toy
safety has long gone from our active projects list.
Technic: One of Pirgim's main points in their report
State Secrets is that all governmental files except those
vital to national security be opened to the public. Who will
decide what is to be kept secret and what will be mad&lt;
public?
Ed: Well, first of all, it's not quite true that the point of the
report is that all governmental files be opened to th&lt;
public except those which relate to national security
You may be confusing the law in Michigan with the federa
statute which deals specifically with national security
issues. Michigan is not in a similar position with respect
to national security. In our freedom of informant
project is addressing solely freedom of information issue:
as they relate to state and local government agencies. Nov
as to who decides as to what information is to be public
one of our main purposes in undertaking this project ha
been to make the law clear in this area so that citizen
can understand what is available to them and what is not
So I guess a very important facet would be to make the lav"
decide what is available to the people and what is no
and to limit the area of discretion by agency administrator
at the state and local level in making that decision
Michigan Technic


partmental memos be turned over to the public for their
scrutiny. How would the memos be published and who
would want to wade through the mountains of material?
Ed: Well first, no part of the proposal that we are making
would turn over wholesale information to the people.
Information would only be made available upon request.
So an agency would not be publishing all the hundreds of
thousands of memoranda that are generated yearly in
wmecases to the public. They would only be turning over to
the persons who request certain types of records. There
ire many cases in which a request is for single documents,
I can hypothesize that such a request would come when an
n depth study or survey is being made by a citizen
)rganization, by a reporter, by a faculty member at a
jniversity, by a student who is interested in working for
that agency, who would be interested in more than just
i very small amount of information but in a rather
arge request.
Fechnic: How much would you estimate this would cost in
:ax dollars?
loe: Zero or pretty close to it.
Ed: The only cost I can imagine would result from a
equirement that certain indexes to forms by published
)y the larger state agencies and some of the larger local
igencies and we suspect that this cost would be minimal.
Wiere it's nor minimal we have specifically provided that
Jurdensome cost considerations will eliminate the require-
ment for publishing those indexes but not eliminate the
•equirement for their compilation.
Joe: Now the other side of this is that the government
will actually save money, by having clear explicit guide-
lines to follow when dealing in citizen requests for
information. Now as Pirgim and almost any reporter can
tell you, agency personnel are confused by the vagueness
of present laws and spend huge amounts of tax-payer paid
time trying to find out what they should and should not
provide or trying to resist disclosure. We have sometimes
Nad to take people to court to get a judge to rule that in
fact they should have provided the document in the first
place. Thousands of dollars were spent by Pirgim and the
government contesting the case in lawyer's time and costs
and the time of people who were involved in the process.
Clear law would save all that money of the tax-payers, and in
my opinion more than counter-balance extra costs because
of index compilation.
Ed: Whenever a citizen is forced to go to court and
Edward Petrini
whenever a state or local agency is forced to defend
an action in court, the costs are enormous. We calculated
in two of the examples that we used in the report
state secrets where a citizens organization called The Citizens
for Better Care in Detroit was required to go to court to
force disclosure of certain inspection reports in the hands
of the departments of Mental Health and Public Health
that the attorney's fees alone excluding the out-of-pocket
expenses, just the fees that those attorneys would have
been charged, has they not been legal aid attorneys in
that particular case, would have amounted as I recall, some
five thousand dollars in one case and seven thousand
dollars in the second. That's a considerable amount of
money for a citizen's organization to bear. The converse of
course is the State was forced to defend those suits, and
likewise attorneys at the state level were required to
devote considerable amounts of time just because the
law was too vague.
Technic: Is Pirgim for making public governmental
expenditures, i.e. budgets?
Joe: The law, the Constitution already requires that
tax-payers have access to information about the use
of tax money. They already are public by law.
Technic: Do you feel the same about smaller agencies?
Joe: I have personally gone to the Department of
Management and Budget and the Legislative Service Bureau
looked at individual vouchers for individual expenses as
small as ten cents and as large as thousands of dollars
by state agencies. Every piece of financial book-keeping
by state, and I presume also by local government is
public and it has to be. The tax-payer has to have a right
to know how tax money is used, just as Pirgim members
have a right if they wish to know how Pirgim's money is
being spent.
Technic: Then Pirgim feels the same way about itself?
Joe: Oh, our finances are an open book.
Technic: Then would you mind giving Technic your
budget?
Joe: To know exactly I would have to check the papers
in the office, which I would be delighted to provide.
Technic: Could you possibly tell us your staff salaries?
Joe: I could if I have the paper in front of meJ And I
would be glad to. You can know how much my Blue
Cross-Blue Shield costs if you want to.

administration and the regents as well as interested
groups of students toward a refund or credit system
which will be as simple as it possibly can be and as
convenient as it possibly can for the non-supporters
of Pirgim."
Technic: With all the money Pirgim receives from the
students, what have you done that directly benefits the
students?
Joe: Are students citizens? Then let's ask the real question,
which is what have we done that benefits all the people
of the state of Michigan? As I am sure that you are
aware, and that Technic's readers are aware, Pirgim has
defined itself as a student effort to benefit all of the
people of Michigan and which focuses on off-campus issues;
recognizing that student government, student publications
and other student organizations have been created to
focus on the student's needs as students. Pirgim was
created three years ago specifically to focus on the student's
interest as citizen, as consumer of goods, and of the
environment and of government in the student's role as
citizen. And so the real question is has Pirgim well served
the student in the student's life as citizen and consumer?
And students do become tenants, and need protection from
conscionable lease terms and Pirgim has focused on that and
students do pay utility bills and install telephones and all
the other things people do that affect their safety, their
economic lives. Pirgim's programs have been related to.
Technic: Why was the present fee collection system
instituted at the University of Michigan?
Joe: Pirgim has had collections at the University of
Michigan since 1972 using what I would call an optional
or yes-no collection mechanism which depended for its
operation on a very concentrated registration process where
everybody passed the same checkpoint during a single week.
When the Crisp system was introduced in 1975 it was
recognized that there was no way that that could take place
once the registration process became mechanized and decen-
tralized, spread over a longer period and eventually spread
to a number of locations on campus. We were told that
it would be at twenty-six different locations where computer
terminals would be on campus. And there was simply
no way that Pirgim could staff a booth for several weeks
at each of the twenty-some locations. At that time
we approached first administrators and then Regents
about some alternative that would enable Pirgim to
continue to exist on campus as a student funded organiza-
tion. What finally resulted from the discussions was a
decision that Pirgim would have the negative check-off
system which is even more similar than the yes-no system
to what students originally petitioned for in 1972 but at
that time the regents were unwilling to adopt because they
didn't feel confident that the amount of student support
was there. This year we were able to point out first that
something like fifty percent of U of M students had been
voluntarily contributing to Pirgim under circumstances
that didn't make it all that easy. Since registration is such
a hasseled time, the emotional pressures are so great
on people and being asked at that point to make a decision
about a contribution is just not reaching people at the ideal
time on their calendars. Despite that, half of the students
on campus had been giving to Pirgim. Second, it was endorsed
by the largest number of student government organizations
who joined with us, and with the Michigan Daily and with
the members of the faculty and administration in going to
the Regents and asking for essentially the original proposed
system to be adopted on the U of M campus, since that
seemed to be the only method by which the Pirgim
financing could be continued. Now our proposal to the
administration when the Regents directed us to sit down
with the administration and try to work out a specific
mechanism for the process was that the bill contain
the Pirgim fee and the notice that it would be refunded or
never even charged to the person who didn't want to
pay it. But we further proposed that the credit or refund
process should be handled in a decentralized manner with
students staffing tables in a number of convenient places on
North Campus and Main Campus to minimize the inconven-
ience to students who would wish not to contribute to
Pirgim, since our basic principle is voluntary support with
convenience for the majority who choose to contribute but
also protection of the minority who choose not to. The
Administration looked at our proposal and offered an
alternative which required students to come to the Student
Accounts Office on the second floor of the Student
Activities Building and asked that the system be adopted
instead of Pirgim's, a decentralized and student run
procedure because they thought it was administratively
more manageable. Well, it probably was administratively
more manageable, but it was inconvenient to a lot of
students, and there have been protests. Pirgim agrees with
with validity of the protests. It should not be made
inconvenient for a nonsupporter. We are now re-entering
discussions with the administration and the Regents as
well as interested groups of students toward a refund or

WE RECRUIT
ENGMEERSWHO
DONT BELIEVE
RECRUITING ADS.
Not that recruiting ads are
misleading. They aren't.
But there's a special kind
of engineer who doesn't accept
what appears to be true on face
value. He accepts only what
he has verified for himself
firsthand.
And then uses what he's
learned as a springboard for
creative, innovative engi-
neering.
That kind of engineer is
our kind of engineer.
We're Combustion Engi-
neering. The Energy Systems
Company.
Over the past half century,
we've helped provide energy
for over 74 countries. In fact,
40% of the Free World's
thermo-electric power is pro-
duced with equipment of C-E
design.
But we want more engi-
neers, especially since there's
an energy shortage we're
trying to do something about.
C-E Lummus, for example,
recently created a clean-burn-
ing liquid fuel from coal that
meets EPA emissions
standards.
C-E Natco developed a
unique method of separating
oil from contaminants, making
it more feasible to recover
oil too costly to recover before.
C-E Crest is designing
better systems to handle gas
and oil, on-shore and off-shore.
C-E Power Systems is
engineering ways to make
more efficient use of fossil
and nuclear energy for today's
needs and tomorrow's.
At C-E, we offer more than
jobs. We offer creative engi-
neers the chance to show the
world what they can do. And
if you're still skeptical about
us, maybe you're the kind of
engineer we need.

organized at the University of Michigan. At the time
I was a law student and very heavily involved in the
effort to have Pirgim adopted. Pirgim received at that time
help directly from literally hundreds of students who
wanted to see a fee collection system adopted that would
refund to students who did not wish to contribute the
dollar fifty per semester that was involved. Some sixteen
thousand students signed a petition to the Regents to urge
Regential approval of Pirgim's fee collection system. Numer-
ous student government organizations including as I recall
the Engineering Council supported that effort. It was not
sense, the offer was publicly made and made known to
every student who registered at U of M this fall that a
dollar fifty credit on their financial statements would be
made to any student who requested it during a particular
week at the Students Accounts Office. In effect, that
could be preceived as a referendum on Pirgim in which
the reward for voting "no" was a dollar fifty and the
reward for voting "yes" was avoiding the inconvenience'
of leaving your house. Now remember that in any
referendum held in a polling place there is that in-
convenience of having to go at a certain time to a
certain place to cast your ballot. In this particular case
"The reward for voting 'No' was a dollar fifty and
the reward for voting 'Yes' was avoiding the incon-
venience of leaving your house."
unanimous. There were some students who felt that Pirgim
should not play a part in the fee collection process, but in
large the vast majority of students supported it at the time.
Subsequent to the petition drive, a referendum was held in
which as I recall something close to eighty percent of the
students supported a Pirgim organization to be formed on
the campus of the University of Michigan. So we conclude
that at the time student support for us was overwhelming.
And in every conceivable way that we were able to obtain
student support we tried and almost unanimously succeeded.
Technic: Very few students who were around in 1972 are
still on campus today. Is this study still valid?
Joe: Let me see is I can address that question in a couple
of ways. One is that student government organizations were
consulted in 1975 on behalf of this proposal, so did the
Daily. Second, the very fact that under the difficult con-
ditions of class registration something like half of all of
the students, undergraduates, graduate and professional of
the University of Michigan were not merely endorsing
Pirgim's existence, but were putting their money behind
their endorsement by voluntarily contributing would in-
dicate the existence of support, term after term. Third,
in effect, this fall another referendum was held in this
though we agree as a refund mechanism it's not a good one.
As a real reelection of a referendum it does have some
validity and I think it's significant that only ten percent of
the students at the U of M despite what amounts to a dollar
fifty bribe to vote no, went during that week of refunds to
request that Pirgim's item be taken off their bill. All those
things combined indicate that while there is valid, legitimate
and widespread dislike for the particular system adopted for
collections which Pirgim agrees with, that there is none-
theless widespread support for Pirgim by the students of
the U of M.
Ed: Pirgim was originally conceived as being an effort
to allow students to participate in affecting their lives
through advocacy of research. Students up to that time
had been in a -difficult position because of the dis-
continuity of their lifestyles. There are always exams,
students have to devote a lot of time to periodically
during the year; there is the summer break, students are
dispersed around the country. There are other activities
which compete for their time. Pirgim was an attempt to
lend some continuity. One of its main purposes for being
organized was tol lend some continuity to student efforts
at social change through hiring a professional staff to work
with them that would be there all the time. The attempt

lives through advocacy of research."

petition drives, to continually conduct referendums, but
provide continuity so that professionals would be attracted
to an organization with some stability in its funding base.
I think that's relevant in considering the level of student
support through the past three years when Pirgim has been
active. The attempt has been made at continuity here
and that student support has been as Joe indicated
continuous.
Marion: I think there is one other aspect which is worth
thinking about, which is any organization on campus would
be in a constant state of chaos, this of course includes the
University itself, if the rules are endlessly being changed, the
sort of ground rules. I mean basically one of the reasons for
having a system of government and voting is to set up rules
or in the case of the U.S. government, laws by which people
expect to abide over a period of years. Essentially, if you say
that all the students that originally voted for Pirgim have
graduated, we could surely say that probably ninety five
per cent of all U.S. laws should then be obviated every few
years as the generation of people who voted for them
or who elected representatives to vote for them had died.
And surely we aren't going to say that all laws that predate
1925 for instance should be again voted on. I think another
nuclear power plants. Another aspect is I think the kind
of moral problem of nuclear power plants. To me there
are two critical problems: One is what are you doing
to the generation presently on earth when you build
a source of power which contains so much radioactivity with-
in it? And the second is what do you do with the waste?
And if the United States does indeed go with the
breeder reactor which produces not only as bad waste as we
have now, but far worse waste, it being Plutonium, the
whole situation of anxiety and possibility for disaster be-
comes greatly exaggerated.
Technic: Isn't the purpose of a breeder reactor to produce
Plutonium to use as fuel in other reactors?
Marion: Yes, but the major problem then is that if
two pounds of Plutonium distributed throughout the
world can give everybody in the world lung cancer, we
have a situation in which ninety-nine point nine percent
containment is not enough. There have already been times,
especially in Oklahoma, where Plutonium has simply
escaped. Nobody knows where it is, nobody knows how
much, nobody knows whether it was stolen or mishandled,
what? It's just plain gone.
Technic: By escaped, we trust you don't mean escaped as
a gas from a containment vessel?
"We further proposed that the credit or refund
process should be handled in a decentralized manner
with students staff ing tables in a number of conven-
ient places on North Campus and Main Campus to
minimize the inconvenience to students who would
wish not to contribute to Pirgim, since our basic
principle is voluntary support."
aspect of that simply is that any organization that depends
on constituent participation is always in essence utterly at
the mercy of the enthusiasm of the constituents, because,
if there is no participation, in a longer or shorter period
of time, usually shorter, the organization ceases to exist.
Technic: With the energy crisis at America's door, why
does Pirgim take such an anti-nuclear power stand?
Marion: Pirgim has suggested a number of ways for
resolving the energy crisis which have nothing to do with
building more nuclear power plants. One of which is
putting major sums of money into what is now called
alternative energy research, solar power, wind power, and
so on. Another is in the widely discussed Pirgim's report
Lifeline by Richard Conlin which indicated that it would
te quite easy for consumers to use considerably less
electricity. This has to do partly with using electricity at
different times of the day, because as you undoubtedly
know, the extra power plants, ie. the nuclear power plants
are built because of the so-called incremental demand or
the peak load demand; the demand either during the day or
the season of the year when energy usage reaches a very
yery high peak. So there are a number of ways to involve
fte citizenry in conservation of energy without building
Marion: I don't know in what form it escaped. It was not
clear in the Times story which I have read, along with a
number of New York Times stories on the subject.
Technic: According to most of the reports that technic has
gone through . . .
Marion: That what has gone through?
Technic: Michigan Technic, That's us.
Marion: Oh, that's the name of the paper, I see.
Technic: ... the feasibility of solar power will, and can
exist only after the early twenty-first century in large scale.
Marion: Well, I assume that if in 1942 you had said to the
average American "when will we get to the moon?" they
probably would have said in 3005. The simple fact is that
the United States can produce practically any technology
if it were: a) determined enough to, and b) put enough
money into. As is undoubtedly known to you all the big
energy combine companies, the big energy trust companies,
by that I mean the big oil companies who also own
half the coal and well over half the uranium love to go
into types of industry which involve very very high
capitol investment. The reason is very simple: They make
an enormous amount of money that way. One of Ralph
Nader's best points in discussing this whole subject is that

agencies of government does not stop at lying or
trying to defraud or mislead the public."
the reason they are so anxious not to have solar technology
is because nobody owns the sun. As a matter of fact,
I've also done a great deal of reading in the subject of
solar technology and get a number of news letters and
so on on the subject. Solar is one thing: just using the
heat from the sun persay . . . and another is the whole
concept of using windmills, and offshore windmills, using
electrolysis to separate out the hydrogen and oxygen and
shipping the hydrogen ashore as a gas. So there are
already several somewhat different technologies involved
here and the one of the offshore windmill has already
been developed. And according to today's Free Press
a major news story has been made for fusion power which
is of course considerably safer than fission.
Joe: On the question of new energy sources possibly not
producing energy until after the year two thousand.
Research the Pirgim has done and was reported before
hearing of the energy research and development authority
indicated that the presently projected development of
nuclear power plants will not yield any net increase in
energy as a result of nuclear power until after the year
two-thousand because the energy used in the construction
of those plants will exceed for that long periods of time the
energy produced by those plants.
Technic: You state that fusion power is much safer
that fission power?
Marion: Somewhat, yes, considerably safer.
Technic: Are you aware that Tritium, which is used in fusion,
is much more radioactive than Plutonium, and is a very
dangerous and highly radioactive gas?
Marion: I'm not sitting here as a great proponant of
fusion, I am mainly sitting here as a major opponent
of fission.
Technic: Yes, but you suggested fusion.
Marion: On the general theory that anything is better than
a breeder.
Joe: We may oppose a new energy source, if when it is
concrete after research there are serious drawbacks to
public safety or economics to it as there are in fact to
fission energy.
Technic: What economic repercussions would exist if all
the nuclear plants on line, under construction, or on the
drawing board were to be abandoned? Would we have more
layoffs in heavy industry, higher energy costs with lower
reliability?
Marion: Higher energy costs and lower reliability, I don't
know that anything has lower reliability than nuclear
power plants. The major problem as you know the plants
in Michigan are endlessly getting shut down. The Consumer's
Power or Detroit Edison or whatever has to go around and
buy more power and then they come up to Lansing and
put pressure on the public service commission to charge
us more money because they have shown the incompetence
to build nuclear power plants which then don't work very
well.
Joe: Let's recognize that the questions asked was a some
what rhetorical one, because it is an extremely unlikely
hypothesis that at an instant in time all of the fission
power plants would be stopped.
Marion: Unless there is an accident, in which case they all
would be stopped.
Technic: Is Pirgim aware that the Atomic Energy
Commission (AEC) has had a review of the Pirgim report
Fallout on the Freeway?
Marion: Oh, certainly, wehave had a copy for a considerable
amount of time. They ordered hundreds and hundreds of
copies of Fallout on the Freeway apparently in order to
have all of their department meeting together for months
on end to make comments on it.
Technic: In the AEC report they accuse Pirgim of using
quotes out of context, selected half truths, accusations, and
unsupported judgements to form a series of overstatements
and mis-statements to frighten and mislead the public.
Marion: They're simply wrong. We didn't. Well, the
Atomic Energy Commission like most other major agencies
of government does not stop at lying or trying to
defraud or mislead the public. The point is very simple,
Pirgim is a very very small organization. We have to tell the
truth. If we don't produce good data absolutely nobody
will ever listen to us. The data we supplied in Fallout
on the Freeway was widely reviewed throughout the
country. We had people at a number of major universities
look at it Johns Hopkins, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Michigan.
MSU and so on. And it was widely considered accurate
and if anything conservative. We stand by all the data in
Fallout on the Freeway. What the Atomic Energy Commis-
sion did was very much what Nixon did during Watergate.
They set up a series of straw men and proceeded to hack at
them. They never answered the major points in Fallout
on the Freeway. The straw men they set up was the fact
that the casks carrying the radioactive waste will not open
under impact. We agree, we also think it is quite unlikely
they will open on impact. This question is never even
addressed in Fallout on the Freeway because we basically
14
Michigan Technic


We brought out two entirely different things which the
AEC never addressed itself to at all. The first is that
the casks would fail under conditions of severe fire. The
casks are tested at fourteen hundred and seventy five degrees
fire for thirty minutes. There are substances going down the
Michigan highways which burn at as high as forty two
hundred degrees. This is close to three thousand degrees
higher than they are tested. There were three thousand
truck-truck accidents involving two or more trucks the
year we studied in Michigan several years ago. It seems
to us entirely likely that one of the truck-truck accidents
will involve a highly flammable substance, many of which
are enumerated in the report, butane, propane and so on
and radioactive waste of some sort. If that happens and
the truck is doused with this liquid or surrounding fire
starts, the cask is indeed very likely to fail. The rebuttal
of the Atomic Energy Commission never mentioned
this. The other point was the failure of mechanical
devices on the casks themselves. The casks are as you
know, water cooled. In other words you have the rod sur-
rounded by water, the water is kept cool by mechanical
devices and so on. If there is a failure by a mechanical
device, or any kind of a leak, in other words, a gasket
leaks or a valve malfunctions and the water begins to leak
out. The rods will then begin to rise to a heat approxi-
mating the temperature they were in the reactor, in
other words twelve to fourteen hundred degrees. This is
the point which the Cesium and a lot of the other elements
will become gasious, and will escape through the same
route that the water took. The AEC, I repeat, never
answered this. Whether or not they like Marion Anderson's
prose is somewhat beside the point. I think it is somewhat
immaterial. The major point is that they didn't answer
the key points we made in this report. They simply, as I
said, set up straw men.
Technic: The AEC takes the position that Professor
Marc Ross' report, the report that much of your report
uses is in error on several points. The AEC states that in
*e case of a fission product release from the casks, the
Cesium level would be extremely low. They base that on
experimental evidence. What is Pirgim's response to the
AEC comments?
Marion: Dr. Ross' data was also based on experimental
evidence. He did almost nine months of research. He has
3 very fine reputation both in Michigan and throughout
the United States. His work was carefully reviewed by a
number of professors in the country prior to the release
of Fallout on the Freeway. The Atomic Energy Commission
has a long history of attacking any scientist not on its
payroll that comes up with critical material. I think that
the comments they made should be taken with that in
consideration. Dr. Ross has nothing to gain personally
either going along with or attacking the AEC. He is at
the University of Michigan and such as an independent
and highly thought-of expert.
Technic: Did Dr. Ross work with you on this report?
Marion: No, Marc Ross and I worked, so to speak, at the
same time. The basic work I did was the analysis of cask
design, and to find out the conditions under which
they would open. For this I did a great many interviews
at the Michigan State University School of Engineering.
I talked to many scientists and physicists and so on. The
work that Marc Ross did along with some of his graduate
students, with the advice of his colleagues, was entirely
on the question of Cesium.
Technic: What qualifications do you have to write a
report on something of a very technical nature?
Marion: The basic concept of public interest research
groups is that a hard-working and intelligent citizen can
by careful research and the use of the prior works and
subsequent work of experts in the field can put out
intelligent analysis bearing directly upon the society.
Technic: On page twenty one of your report Fallout
on the Freeway, you state fuel rods (spent) were left
over night in a lot in Joplin Mo. Pirgim's report states that
the casks containing the fuel rods were left unprotected
from the small hands of children. According to Dr.
Wilkinson, a source that was used in your report, the
trucks were stored in a fenced-in area. They were
protected by fences that few if any children could
climb. Furthermore he claims that they were shipped
dry so that the contamination Pirgim states was due to
cask leakage according to Dr. Wilkinson, could not have
come from the contents inside, and was probably due to
the improper cleansing of the cask after loading of the
fuel rods. The level was stated to be two or three
times the AEC maximum, but according to experts still
twenty five times too low to cause any not ble radiation
damage. According to the AEC typical cask temperatures
run around one hundred and eighty degrees Fahrenheit. Dr.
Wilkinson states that a child would have to scale ? fence
climb on a truck, climb to the top of the cask where the
contamination occured and either lick the cask in specific
"What the Atomic Energy Commission did was very
much what Nixon did during Watergate. They set
up a series of straw men and proceeded to hack
them. They never answered the major points in
Fallout on the Freeway."

areas, or put his burnt hands (from climbing the cask)
in his mouth. What, in your estimation, is the probability
of these events taking place?
Marion: Well, the first point is, when I discussed this matter
with Dr. Wilkinson, he in no way mentioned that the trucks
were in a fenced-in area while in Joplin Mo. I took
extremely careful notes in the interview which I remember
vividly, being quite surprised at all the things he was
telling me, not that he was telling me things as they happened.
I will recount what he told me. He was waiting with his
group of people at MSU because the casks were supposed
to arrive on a Friday night. We waited to very, very late
at night and they never came. So he went home very
disturbed, very worried, didn't know where they were, did-
not know what was happening. He came back to work Mon-
day morning and sometime Monday morning the truck
showed up. What Dr. Wilkinson said to me was, "These men
were driving from my recollection from California, their
families were in Joplin Mo. They, you know, like most
people get lonesome for their families, decided to go to
Joplin, not directly to Michigan and stay there prior to
coming to MSU." I question whether or not Dr. Wilkinson
knew that those trucks were in the lot behind the high
fence so that little children could not scale it. Maybe
they were parked out in front of people's houses. No,
maybe they were, and it is conceivable that the drivers
told Dr. Wilkinson, but my own speculation is that I
doubt when those drivers arrived two and a half days late
and I assume both anxious and apologetic they were sitting
there recounting where the truck was parked overnight.
That doesn't make a whole lot of difference however.
Another aspect is that Dr. Wilkinson told me that the
cask, that a great deal of the cask was contaminated.
He did not tell me just on top. He said, and I quote,
"My people were crawling all over that cask cleaning it up."
Specific areas obviously can mean three areas or ten areas
or one hundred and twenty five areas. What he told me was
"My people were crawling all over that cask and cleaning
it up."

Angelo Muzzin
It wasn't long ago when a large number of engineers
faced what was the most disastrous situation of their lives.
The West Coast Aerospace industry was forced to let go a
large number of employees during the difficult period of
1969 to 1971. The industry's firings brought in view the
frail nature of the profession that the engineer belongs. Mass
firings and job insecurity were the scourge of many.
In this atmosphere of career chaos many of the inadequa-
cies of the profession came into focus. Many felt they were
only small nuts and bolts in the large industrial machine,
many lost pensions and benefits because of the gypsy like
Coving from job to job. Many felt they received inadequate
Pay raises, many feared being branded as obsolete after
only ten or so years on the job, and many suffered the in-
ability to return to engineering. Forty percent of the
engineers during this period felt that they should have
chosen a different profession. Today the situation is not as
critical. The employment of engineers is stable. Yet many
of the problems that face our profession have not been
solved.
The profession of engineering, being both what an en-
gineer does and the group that does it, has many inadequacies
compared to other professions. In the U.S. the number of
engineers varies depending on how an engineer is defined.
A rough estimate would be 1.5 million; less than one fourth
of these belong to any of the professional societies. This
means that the majority of engineers have no identity or
association with the profession as a group. In this situation
an exchange of ideas and the concern for the welfare of
engineers is almost impossible. Those engineers who do be-
long to a professional society also suffer a degree of isolation
because there is no single organization that represents all
engineers. There is a lack of unity between present pro-
fessional groups in representing the interest and welfare of
engineers. Engineers unfortunately don't have the benefit of
Member 1975

as the center of medical activity. For the engineer there is
no single organization that will take interest in his pro-
fessional performance, identify with him in both technical
and social problems and affairs and that will serve as his
advocate in response to his role in society.
The engineering profession is ambiguous in the make up of
its members. Professional engineering societies, with the
exception of National Society of Professional Engineers,
have no educational prerequisite for membership. Hence
the direction of policy of these organizations may be
influenced by non-engineers. This same lack of homo-
genousness can be found in industry. It is common among
some industries to define in their own way who is an
engineer. Often a company will reward an experienced and
successful draftsman, mathematician, physicist, etc., with
the title of "engineer". It is difficult to define a professional
group that does not strictly define its members. Those non-
engineering degreed creative individuals should be rewarded
and given due respect, but this does not justify the lack of
control on engineering status. Have you ever heard of a
successful physician's assistant being promoted to doctor?
This would never happen due to the strict control of the
A.M.A. and state licensing boards.
A predominant aspect of engineering is the function an
engineer is given by industry. An oversupply of professionals
can yield a difficult situation similar to that described
in the Aerospace industry. A surplus of engineers in any
field leads to improper use of them. An engineer can be
hired to perform a technical or non-engineering job not re-
quiring the knowledge and skill required of engineering
activities. Being hired for a non-engineering position until
"a job opens up", regardless of the pay is obviously a denial
of the stature of the engineer. This type of practice does not
only occur to some junior engineers but also to an exper-
ienced person in a situation of oversupply or transition.
These technical jobs should be performed by engineering
technologist and technicians who are trained for such. The
profession has a responsibility to itself to maintain a
product scarcity, (engineering manpower), in order to
attain the stature due it. It is not hard to see why an
engineer soon after graduation may feel his four to six
years in school create an illusion of what engineering is all
about, and find that it does not exist.
There are many changes that must be made. The
engineer, as long as he is regarded only as an employee and
not as a "free artisan", he can not consider himself as a
professional in the true sense. That is, a professional being
one who practices his skill for the betterment of mankind
and following his own perspective as to what his contribu-
tion should be. If an engineer is not free to serve the
public with the knowledge and skill of his art how can he
be considered a professional?
Rights are gained by a group that society regards as a
profession. Some engineers are engaged in that difficult
process of securing those rights. One of these rights is the
accreditation of private practice for all engineers. This
should include any situation regardless of whether or not a
person is an employee of an entity such as a corporation.
The engineer being a professional should be viewed as self-
employed. It an engineer's work is confined to one company,
his work should be viewed as a professional service on a
contractual basis. This contractual agreement should not
exclude his perogative to serve others in this capacity. The
nature of a contract between an engineer and employer
must be uplifted from what exists for most. He must
never be viewed as simply a paycheck at the end of the
week and this required to punch a time clock or log his
working hours. The engineer offers his specialized and
costly services in terms of a contract with specifications of
the services to be rendered.
There are various practices that exist now that should
be totally eliminated. Engineering is one of the few pro-
fessions or maybe the only profession where age and ex-
perience can count against you. It is not unheard of fora
company to force into retirement engineers in the prime of
their activity and at the same time to hire new graduates.
Employers seem to view a person in his '50's, 60's 70*5
as less desireable for their use. It is hard to believe that
an engineer that reaches the age of retirement is suddenly
transformed into a less qualified person. Therefore it is
strongly advocated that engineers should be allowed to work
until he feel the need to retire. Another form of unpro-
fessional control is the practice of limiting the employment
of engineers based on their physical fitness and state of
health. This type of discrimination can be found where the
hiring policies of the institution are influenced by concerns
for the company's employee health care plan. The engineer
is obviously hired for his mental abilities and not his body.
He should not be subjected to a physical exam. It is the
responsibility of the engineer to see that his physical state
would not hinder his work. Another unprofessional activity
that engineers have recently been subjected to is surveillance
and psychological evaluation techniques used for job
evaluations. These practices take on various forms de-
pending on the "progressiveness" of the personnel manage-
ment. But regardless of the new method used, these prac-
tices do not inherently view the engineer as a self-reliant
professional.
In addition to the above proposed rights, the pro-
fession needs a national professional society. This pro-
fessional society would serve to register engineers on a
national basis and thus giving engineers the right to practice
anywhere in the U.S. The state registration system must be
surplanted by a national system. There are presently
fifty-five state licensing boards each with his own definition
of engineer. At present an engineer registered in one state
has no legal basis to practice in another. Since most engineers
will practice in more than one state, the problem of
additional registration is met. Under a uniform registration
system there would be a standard definition of what an
engineer is. In addition to aiding registration, a national
organization is needed to advocate for the engineering view-
point on problems confronting society. The needed pro-
fessional organization must be able to collaborate with
existing legal institutions. This type of activity should in-
clude lobbying by a professional staff in regard to federal
decisions on technology and appropreations. At the other
end of the spectrum it should include grass roots support
of local projects that require engineering judgement.

applies here. With the increased professional nature of en-
gineering comes the responsibility of the engineer to main-
tain his professional status. Continuing education is a must
for an engineer to stay abreast of the major developments in
his field. Not only are new theories to be learned but also
new techniques are constantly being developed. A surgeon
can perform a tonsillectomy with techniques used he
learned 20 years ago and still made a viable living. Can you
think of many phases of engineering that has not changed in
the past 20 years, and can be performed with the same
tools and techniques used then? One proposed guideline
for continuing education is to require an engineer to com-
plete a certain number of class hours every few years. An
example is requiring 30 hours of in class work every year.
At present there are many industries with foresight that
assist engineers in keeping up with developments in tech-
nology. This objective is also aided by membership in
technical societies. It is the responsibility of the engineer
to insure himself as a timely and accurate source in his
field for his benefit and also the benefit of his client.
An engineer's responsibilities will increase as his role in
society expand. When an engineer is under contract to a
firm it is his responsibility to see that the rights of that
firm are not abused. One area of difficulty is the loyalty
a company deserves. For no reason should an engineer re-
lease confidential material in order to increase his own gain.
With job changes engineers made, it would be very conven-
ient to take with him private technology to a competitor.
This same type of loyalty is required of a consulting
engineer who must keep his work with one company con-
fidential if he does work for a competitor.
Civil involvement is a responsibility shared by all engin-
eers. Engineers must take an active role in government at
all levels, (federal, state, local). The analytic training and
logical approach to problems is needed to solve many of
the technological dilemmas that face our society. Engineers
active in politics and policy making are necessary to insure
proper perspective on highly technological issues. This
civil responsibility has to become an integral part of how an
engineer views his role in this world.
If and when an engineer views himself as a professional
a new dimension of moral responsibility will have to be
shouldered. The public's welfare is the utmost in his evalua-
tion of his work. If the time comes for an engineer to
choose between taking an assignment which is not in the
Public interest or following his moral guides, will he be
free to make the proper choice? At present most com-
panies do not respect the right of an engineer to refuse
unethical activity without prejudice or loss of contract. The
engineer lacks the backing of a strong professional organi-
zation to aid him in his decision. In the medical field if a
doctor refuses to perform an operation he felt was wrong,
a hospital would have to respect his decision, otherwise it
would be censured by both the medical profession and the
Public. The engineer therefore finds it more difficult to
follow his own moral convictions if tested. Engineers have
no strong professional support.
The movement of engineers into a consciousness raising
in regards to his role in society is not a self-serving attitude.
Engineers affect public welfare to a larger magnitude than
any of the established professions. When professionalism
becomes an inherent factor in engineering the benefactor will
not only be on the engineer but also the public.

An Innovative Highway
by Pete DeCamp
Created under the concept that routes which avoid the
business centers of cities are needed to serve traffic bound
to or from points other than the center of the city,
suburban Detroit's 1-275 is nearing completion. First con-
ceived in the late 1950"s, the thirty miles of north-south
pavement from I-75 near Monroe to I-96 in Novi costing
roughly 8.2 million, is justified, according to the preliminary
engineering report, by the industrial development of metro-
politan Detroit which has createo* a demand for routes
'capable of carrying large volumes of traffic in a north-
south direction' around the city. I-275 was also designed to
serve industries along its corri'dbr, whose need for adequate
transportation facilities have increased.
The highway, one of its kind, has some special innova-
tions, but also is afflicted with some special problems un-
expectedly encountered in its construction. For starters,
a major steel supplier of bridge beams for the project
collapsed, and as a result, the Michigan Department of State
Highways and Transportation (MDSHT) has had to advertise
new contracts for bridge steel. Until the contracts are won,
various bridge completions are delayed, due to the lack of
steel.
Another problem along a five mile stretch near New Bos-
ton, is the water table that lies just beneath the soil surface.
This, in addition to the heavy rains suffered in the area
during the summer and fall, has played havoc with the
grading projects along this stretch. The decision by engin-
eers to haul sand into the project to replace the clay that is
usually used as a subbase, was costly, but a 'sand embank-
ment' is a more reliable foundation in wet conditions, and
will prove to be considerably less costly in future highway
maintenance bills. The first priority of the MDSHT is to
hope for good weather and to complete the grading this
winter. In anticipation of the MDSHT's plans for paving next
summer, contractors are competing in a race to find sand
to be used as a subbase to the concrete. Charlie Sugden,
a principle contractor, complained of the difficulty of
finding available sand, and foresees the need to haul it from
great distances.
A typical highway bridge is supported by concrete
piles, steel beams, and flexible rockers between the piles
and the beams that adjust to the bridge's expansions and
contractions. One of more unusual problems that has
hindered construction is, in the words of project engineer
Carl Christenson. an 'error in soils calculations.' The con-
20
Michigan Technic


River are shifting, causing the rockers underneath the
beams to tilt at full capacity. The material used in the fill
which supports the road on the south side of the bridge
abutment is too heavy for the soil underneath to support
it making the soil, the riverbed and making the piles move.
To alleviate this problem, the fill must be removed from the
south side of the bridge 40 to 50 feet behind the abutment,
and will be replaced with lightweight conders. The rockers
will then be restored to equilibrium by jacking up the
bridge beams.
Two of the highway 275's project engineers are 'IT gra-
duates Ross LaVanway and John Baxter. LaVanway's job,
a two mile stretch from Ford Rd. south to Michigan Ave.,
is primarily a 'grading contract' only. Baxter's job runs
from 6'/2 Mile Rd. to 8'/2 Mile. These, and the other
project engineers must work with some innovative highway
designs that did not originate on the planning table in
Lansing. One of the new highway's frills is a bike path that
runs its entire length, added to the plans by the same Lan-
sing legislator that initiated the annual Lansing to Mackinac
bike ride. The bike path, accessible by a break in the fence
at every mile road, presents a problem of keeping bikers at a
safe distance from the road, especially through interchanges
and under bridges. The slope paving underneath the bridges
have built-in flat paths which will be at about the same
elevation as the highway and bikepath, and that means
directing bikers close to the highway. The only means of
eliminating this hazard is with the protection of a sturdy
fence.
Construction of new highways in the present day is
subject to much public opposition. Constructing a subur-
ban highway has the further disadvantage of passing through
a residential area which makes it even more susceptible to
public opposition. The purchasing of the real estate through
the process of "eminant domain" is itself very unpopular.
Beyond that, highways tend to be unsightly, noisy, and gen-
erally not ecological. Consequently residents in neighborhoods
alongside the highway who were there before the highway
was built felt that they were entitled to protection from the
noise,so the MDSHT incorporated long mounds of dirt into
theirplans, which will run the length of these neighborhoods.
These mounds, eventually to be covered with grass, trees,
or shrubs, will be effective in reducing all of the sight of
the traffic, and most, but not all, of the noise.
Another new twist to this interesting bypass is an
experimental 'tower lighting' which will be used at the
1-275 and 1-96 interchange, in place of ordinary street
'amps. Eleven 100 ft. towers, and nineteen 80 ft. towers are
Placed strategically throughout the interchange. The 100 ft.
lowers house eight 1000-watt 'symmetrical luminaires'
'hat emit light in all directions and can be raised or lowered
°Y a gearbox at the base of each tower for replacing bulbs.
The shorter 80 ft. towers house four 1000-watt luminaires
that emit light in two directions only. "The advantage to
'his type of lighting", says Dale Morse, project engineer for
the interchange, "is that they can be placed further away
'rom the roadway, thus reducing the risk of collision."
So if you're driving around, looking for the latest techno-
!ogical marvel, take a cruise down I-275 (when it's opened).

50 Years Ago
"It is not my intention to deprecate the engineer-by edu-
cation, but to point out that the mere acquirement of
knowledge from books or from the experience of others the
ability to pass an examination and to exhibit a diploma - does
not constitute an engineer. "The author of the above passage
is unknown but it appeared in the January 1925 Technic.
Truer words were never spoken.
The 20's and 30's were the golden age of radio, but
that doesn't mean the technology for television did not
exist. As a matter of fact, a device existed that could trans-
mit 10 pictures per second over telephone lines or radio
waves. This device was reviewed in the January 1925 Technic
in an article entitled "The Transmission of Photographs By
Radio," The mechanism was quite ingenious; it consisted of
a set of circular rotating prisms that scanned a picture or
scene in a series of horizontal lines. The output of the
prisms was presented to a photo-sensitive device which
produced an electrical signal. The picture was reproduced
by a light beam which scanned over a plate of ground glass.
The light beam was modulated as it scanned by the electri-
cal signal produced by the camera. "One may see around
obstructions, over mountains, perhaps ultimately around the
earth," marvelled the reporter. (Would he have believed in
full color from the moon?) "An entire opera might thus be
enjoyed through both the ear and eye, as all the family, old
and young, listens in and looks on amid the comforts of
the home fireside." (He probably never imagined the heights
of banality which it would eventually reach).
It does not need to be said that many little things that
we take for granted today were once considered great
luxuries. Examples abound, but automobile tires is not one
of the more obvious examples. The article "Shoeing A Car
With Low Pressure Air" discusses the advantages of the
latest development in tire technology: "Balloon tires."
These so-called "Balloon tires" were about 6 inches wide.
For those who have never ridden in a vehicle with high
pressure tires the luxury of the ride with low pressure tires
can not be appreciated, but, there were many other advan-
tages to wider and lower pressure tires, for example, in-
creased mileage, better handling and better traction and
stopping.
The Technic could probably go down in history as the
most risque magazine of 1925. An advertisement for Crane
showed an actual lavatory with seven visible toilets.
Scandalous!
50 and 25
Years Ago
by Ray Barry
25 Years Ago
When looking through the issues of the Technic from the
1920's it becomes evident that there was a preoccupation
with electricity, electric devices, and the production and
transmission of electric power. If the preoccupation in the
20's was with electricity, the preoccupation in the 50'swas
with nuclear power. The entire December 1950 issue of the
Technic was devoted to nuclear research, at U of M, or
more specifically, the Phoenix Project.
The Michigan Memorial-Phoenix Project was a creation ot
U of M students and alumni as a living memorial of the
579 members of the University family killed in World War
II. The purpose of the project was to investigate the peace
ful uses of atomic science. The project would involve the
construction of a new building to house the operations.
There was great hope and optimism in the air, hope and
optimism for the prospects of atomic science in solving
many problems and curing many ills. Senator Homer
Ferguson defined the project as follows: "The project will
not only serve as a center for technical and scientific re-
search, but will draw together all other branches of know-
ledge of the University in a coordinated effort to explore the
significance of atomic science in all human endeavor."
The emphasis was on the coordination of all branches ot
knowledge. The senator also made it clear that "The pro-
ject seeks and will accept no money from the govern-
ment." This statement underlined the fact that the project
was a private endeavor, separated from politics and which
did not exist for political purposes.
"The Michigan Memorial-Phoenix Project is a great step
closer to the complete realization of the Utopian era," one
student optimistically stated. It is not clear what he meant
by "the Utopian era", it does show the kind of optimism
that existed at that time, though.
Some of the proposed areas of study were: the study
of power plants, the study of atomic fuels, of radiation
shielding, measurementation, carbon 14 dating, and the
safe handling, storage, and transportation of atomic mater-
ials.
The most profound statement concerning the project
was made by University President Alexander G. Ruthven.
He said, "The Phoenix project stands as a trading post
where hope can freely be exchanged for fear." t\I\

I am Kodak's Director of Business and Technical Personnel
If you would like to work for Kodak, write and
tell me about yourself. First, though, let me
tell you about us.
We make photo materials and image-
handling equipment in Rochester, N.Y. and
Windsor, Colo. In Kingsport, Tenn., Longview,
Tex., and Columbia, 5.C., we make industrial
chemicals, fibers, and plastics.
Most of the people who make our business
decisions thought they were being hired for
technical work.
Those who resist the drift (or the draft) into
business matters obviously burn with desire to
keep doing technical work. Only that type
ought to make a life career of technical work.
We are impressed by an engineering degree
because engineering courses are tough. If you
acquire an engineering degree despite having
had to keep your mind on other pressing
matters at the same time, you look all the
better to us.
You also look a little better to us if you do it
in one engineering discipline like chemical,
mechanical, electrical, etc. The interdisciplinary
stuff you learn after you get here. Yet most of
our engineering is in fact interdisciplinary.
Whether you come as a chemical, mechanical,
or electrical engineer, what's important is
evidence that you know how to dig down deep
enough into fundamentals to understand a
problem.
Good grades in college provide that evidence.
Deeper understanding is the academic goal.
But Kodak is a business, not an academic
institution. Understanding the problem is
necessary but not sufficient. To do something
effective about it takes drive, fortitude,
persistence, thoroughness. It takes ability to
juggle a lot of things at the same time. Grades
are only part of the evidence of the strength
needed on both the business and technical sides.
If you are confident you have that evidence
and are still interested in us, please so inform
me, Ed Butenhof, Kodak, Rochester, N.Y. 14650.

I960: The Xerox 914 Copier-
fast, clear, clean reproduction.
1975: The Xerox 9200 Duplicating System—
ultra-fast duplicating and collating—plus a host
of other Xerox Information-handling products.
Xerox Copiers are so well known today that it's
hard to believe we unveiled our first, revolution-
ary, commercial copier in the early 1960's.
Since then, the fast pace of our growth has made
us a classic of success in the annals of busi-
ness. Xerox people have brought into practical
reality several new generations of xerographic
copiers, high-speed duplicators and color
copying equipment, and other communication
innovations such as the Telecopier facsimile
transceiver, plus supporting products.
Today the great thrust at Xerox is toward
integrating varied technologies into the informa-
tion handling systems of the future. We are
now shaping a company that will provide capa-
bilities for originating, organizing, processing,
storing, retrieving, reproducing, transmitting and
communicating information. The era immedi-
ately ahead is going to be one of genuine
professional challenge and opportunity for
talented engineers of many interests.
We have a wide range of openings for imagina-

THIS MONTH'S TECHNIC
If you get a feeling of deja vu reading this issue, it is
for a good reason. The issue is predominantly written by
last year's staff, some who have already graduated and
left the fair city of Ann Arbor. But first things first.
The lead article this month is called "How Biofeedback
May Change Your Life." What is biofeedback? Hopefully
this article explains that in a certain amount of detail.
Biofeedback is a subject on the frontier of science. It
didn't really get off the ground till a few years ago when
the concept was accidentally discovered. The prospects
for biofeedback are amazing and enormous. It is surely
an area that will stir much controversy in the upcoming
years; something to keep an eye on. The author of this
article is Ray Barry, who tries to edit this magazine. Ray
buried himself in the library for two weeks and emerged
with this verbal conglomeration. I'm not sure Ray has
been the same since: if you see a funny character
bumping into the walls in East Engin., don't pay any
attention, it's probably Ray concentrating on his alpha.
Returning from last year's line-up is former editor
Jim Epperson. Jim graduated last year and passed on to
the big, bad, cold and cruel "real world." Jim has a few
thoughts on what it's like to make the transition from
being a student to being an "elght-to-fiver." Jim, who
must hold some kind of record for all-nighters, is finally
enjoying that great prize in the sky which awaits the
graduate engineer: a night off. Jim graduated last year with
a B.S. in Applied Math.
Once again Technic presents that beloved feature, "The
Good Old Days." This month it covers such diverse topics
as the first snowmobile and women engineers.
"Pictorial News Briefs" is a new type of feature in the
Technic. It cannot be described, it simply must be seen.
Unfortunately, no one is willing to take credit for this
adventure, but that is perfectly understandable.
On the letters page there are two letters this month. The
first letter is from a Prof, of Nuclear Engineering and it
concerns the PIRGIM interview in the Dec. '75 issue. The
second letter is from a senior in Chemical with a gripe about
lazy professors.

from the editor's desk
A letter came across my desk the other morning. That,
of course, is not very unusual; a lot of mail comes across
my desk. This one was different, however; this one had a
professor attached to the other end. This professor was a
little distraught. I opened his letter to see who he was; I
recognized the name but not the face. I knew him as a
professor who demonstrated his concern for the students
and college and as a man with insight in human affairs
that so many others lack. It wasn't as much the contents
of the letter that hit me as it was the ensuing conversation.
It was an article about cheating which appeared in that
morning's daily that spurred him to come up to our office.
The subject had been on his mind for some time. He cited
several different cases in the last couple of semesters in
which he highly suspected cheating, but he gave the student
the benefit of the doubt. I had to admit the cases were quite
suspect. Then he posed the question, does the Honor
System work? I didn't have the answer, but according to
his experience, the system was falling short. If he noticed
several cases, then how many were there that he hadn't
noticed?
The Honor System was initiated in 1916 as the result of
a student petition. It was a high ideal based on the principle
that it is dishonorable for any person to receive credit for
work that is not his own. It is a principle professional
engineers are expected to uphold, so why not students? The
faculty have agreed to accept the student's word of honor,
and it is a matter of self respect to uphold that trust.
Breaking the Honor Code simply demonstrates that th
offender is not worthy of that trust.
Inherent in the Honor System is that the prevention o
dishonesty should be left to the students—not the faculty
This means that anyone who sees an offense must report it o
the system will break down. The good of the whole colleg
is at stake. Anyone who receives a diploma and does no
deserve it discredits himself, the reputation of the teachim
staff, and the college.
The suggested method for handling an offender is firs
to warn him that he is in violation of the Honor Code. If hi
persists in his violation he should be reported to the in
structor or the Honor Council.
Since the system seems to be falling short, the questioi
arises; Is it a workable system? Is it even realistic to expec
the system to work? In most instances the honest student
are usually too busy with their own work to notice what th
other students are doing. Then, too, classrooms have be
come so crowded recently that it is not difficult for evei
the most honest students to see another student's pape
without even trying. Or, perhaps students have mor
loyalty to students than they do to their professor, th
profession, and the honor code. Maybe it's just that student
don't fully understand the Honor Code. Everyone know
about the pledge, but how many students realize there i
more than just a pledge involved in the Honor Code
The Honor System is a respected tradition at Michigan
and a high ideal. But, is it working, or is it workable? W
would like to know what you think.

Change Your Life
by Ray Barry
Some believe it is a panacea, others doubt that it has any
merit. Some say it will raise man to undreamed of
heights of accomplishment, yet others refute such in-
flated claims. What's all the controversy about? Biofeedback
training, also known as visceral learning.
Despite the controversy, biofeedback has turned the
medical world upside down. Using biofeedback training,
subjects have been able to learn to control such body func-
tions as heartbeat and blood pressure. This has forced a
change in some of the traditional physiological assump-
tions about how the body functions, especially the "in-
voluntary" systems. Body functions such as heartbeat and
blood pressure were thought of as being uncontrollable
or autonomic until biofeedback training proved otherwise.
Eastern cultures which practice Zen, yoga, and other forms
of meditation have known this for centuries, it wasn't till
just recently that the western world woke up to it.
Formal biofeedback experimentation began about six
years ago. Dr. Barbara Brown working in a laboratory in a
Veterans hospital is generally credited with it's discovery.
Although some primitive biofeedback experiments had been
done as early as 1900, serious study had to await the
development of modern technology, some of which re-

suited from the space program.
What is it?
In biofeedback training the subject is given some type of
signal which indicates the condition of a particular body
function, for example he might be allowed to watch his
heartbeat on an oscilloscope. The.i he is told to try to in-
crease or decrease his pulse without physical exertion.
After several such training sessions the subject is usually
able to increase or decrease his pulse at will without the
help of biofeedback.
There are many different types of biofeedback depending
upon which body function is being monitored. The most
common functions are: skin temperature, skin conductivity,
skin potential, muscle tension, heartbeat, blood pressure,
and brain waves.
Many claims have been made for biofeedback, some
true, some uncertain and others outright lies. Some of the
claims made are: it helps conquer pain without drugs, helps
quit smoking, cures insomnia, increases salesmanship, stimu-
lates increased happiness, increases creativity, improves
memory, improves health, increases number of friends,
helps lose weight, enhances meditation, helps reach instant
nirvana, cures headaches, helps conquer asthma, helps
epilepsy victims, puts one in touch with the universe.

cures hypertension, helps victims of diseased hearts, cures
indigestion, ad infinitum.
Revealing Skin
According to Dr. Brown the skin can yield much in-
formation about a person, his intelligence, psychological
state, ability to learn, motivation; memory, awareness,
perception, thought process, sex, and age. The skin speaks
a language all its own, the problem is deciphering it. There
is considerable disagreement over the skin's vocabulary. All
of the lines and scribbles made by the chart recorder which
monitors the skin's electrical activity mean something, but
scientists cannot agree on what. One thing is known, how-
ever, electrical activity of the skin surges upward with
emotion and excitement and falls off with relaxation. Be-
yond this, the importance of what the skin is saying is
debated widely. Some say the skin's reactions are simply
due to sweating and other simple physiological phenomena,
others claim that the skin is a mirror of the mind's emotional
state.
In one experiment subjects were given a harmless elec-
tric shock accompanied with the words "receive a shock".
As was expected the skin reacted to the shock. After the
subjects had been given several shocks all that was necessary
to get a skin response was to say "receive a shock." What this
experiment shows is that skin responses can be learned;
the amazing thing about it is, the subject didn't know his
skin was reacting. This suggests that the learning was
subconscious and the subconscious mind was reacting. In
other words, the skin could be a direct route to the sub-
conscious mind. If this is true, someday the measurement
of skin responses could be a key tool in psychotherapy. It
could also be catastrophic if applied, for example, to the
development of a'mind reading machine.
One simple application of skin responses is in aiding the
determination of schizophrenia. Schizophrenics' skin re-
sponses are not consistent, when given a repeated stimulus
their skin reaction will vary.
Since the electrical activity of the skin surges up when the
subject is experiencing emotion or excitement the measure-
ment of skin response can be used to detect and perhaps
control anxiety. When we are young we are trained to
withhold our emotions. This makes it particularly tough
for a psychotherapist to know when his patient is experien-
cing anxiety unless the patient tells him. One form of pro-
posed therapy would be a fairly normal session with a
therapist except that the patient would be connected to a
skin monitor. Both the patient and the therapist would be
able to watch the monitor so that they could pin point
stress and sources of anxiety. Such a method could save
time and help prevent a mistaken analysis.
Measuring skin responses has also been proposed as a
method of controlling anxiety. The subject would connect
himself to a monitor, using biofeedback training tech-
niques, learn when he was in an anxious state and how to
control his anxiety. There could be some dangers in this
type of biofeedback training. We have been trained to
suppress the expression of our emotions, our skin response
is one remaining expression of our emotions (according to
one theory). What would happen if we learned to suppress
this expression also? Would we become zombies? More
research is needed in this area before everyone's anxieties can
be exorcised.
Another application in this area might be the develop-
ment of a reliable lie detector. There is already a drawback
here; several people have been taught to make their skin
lie. Besides this practical consideration there is the question
of the desirability of such a device and the question of
morality. A reliable lie detector is akin to a mind reading
machine.
Muscle Management
One form of biofeedback that has already found much
application involves sensors which inform the subject of
muscle tension. The subject watches a monitor that indi-
cates muscle tension and is told to try and relax. At first
the monitor responds to very slight relaxation. As the subject
becomes more adept at relaxing, the monitor is made less
sensitive so that it takes a greater degree of relaxation for it
to respond. The subject is put through numerous training
sessions and in most cases fairly rapidly learns the art of
profound relaxation.
This all sounds quite ridiculous. After all, what is so
difficult about determining when your muscles are tense
and when they are relaxed? Actually, you can't. What your
body feels is relative tenseness. When you feel that you are
relaxing your muscles, there may actually be consider-
able tension in them; it's just that there is less tension
than before. This tension arises from our intricate system
of balance. Our muscles work in pairs to keep us balanced.
If one muscle tenses another must pull in the opposite
direction to keep us balanced. Just because we think we
are resting does not mean that our muscles are not working.
We actually have no awareness of the effort being made by
our muscles to keep us balanced; it is a subconscious
operation. The result is that we forget that we are tense.
Problems with extreme muscle tension arise from the
fact that our muscles are our prime avenue of expression.
When we experience mental tension our muscles tense,
while other muscles react to keep us balanced. Thus,
tension builds. We may become aware of tense muscles
and try to relax them, but what we feel is only a relative
relaxation, there may still be quite a bit of tension. We
become so used to muscle tension we do not know what it
feels like to really relax. The results can be sore muscles,
tension headaches and improper blood circulation. Im-
proper blood circulation can lead to increased susceptibility
to diseases and premature death.
One application of biofeedback training in this area has
been the relief from chronic tension headache. People who
suffer from chronic tension headache can learn to relax
their forehead and neck muscles through biofeedback
training and avert a great deal of their headaches.
Muscle tension feedback has applications to psycho-
therapy also. Dr. Ralph Hefferline, one of the earliest
researchers of internal muscle states, found that chronic
muscle tension sometimes stems from blocking. Young
children are continually reminded to repress their emotional
expression. At first the child consciously tells his body to
hold back. After a while he learns to hold back and the
act soon passes into the unconscious. In one of Hefferline's
10
Michigan Technic


dicator and told his subjects to explore and become aware
of their muscle tension. He did not tell them to relax, just
explore. The subjects reported remembering forgotten
incidents, usually these incidents were the ones that were
initially responsible for the blocking.
Subjects in other experiments who had learned profound
relaxation reported changes of consciousness and in their
state of awareness. This has been likened to the eastern arts
of yoga and meditation. Generally, though, the sensations
differ with different subjects.
Or. Robert Gregg, a clinical professor of obstetrics and
gynecology at Loma Linda University near Los Angeles, has
a unique application for muscle tension biofeedback. Dr.
Gregg has been using it to teach expectant mothers to
relax. Expectant mothers develop a great deal of anxiety
and tension. The women were allowed to rent a portable
monitor which they took home and trained with for at least
thirty minutes twice a day. The monitor emitted a high
pitched noise indicating tenseness. The pitch increased with
tension giving a relative indication of tension. The women
were trained for several weeks in preparation for delivery.
According to Dr. Gregg labor goes much more quickly and
smoothly when the mother is relaxed. His study shows that
there is a considerable decrease in the length of labor and in
the amount of medication such as pain killers and
tranquilizers required by women who were trained to relax
than those who weren't.
Other unique applications are arising for biofeedback
training. One of these is helping asthma victims prevent
attacks. It is estimated that about fifty percent of asthma
victims, emotions play an important role in instigating an
attack. Doctors at the Children's Memorial Hospital in
Chicago have taught asthmatic children to relax when tjiey
feel an attack coming on. They have also been teaching them
to expand the breathing tubes in their lungs. This doesn't
involve muscle tension feedback. The sensing device used
here measures the amount of oxygen entering and leaving
the child's lungs. The child is taught, or teaches himself, to
^crease the amount of oxygen entering the blood. The
child can repeat what he learned and prevent an attack
*vhen he feels one coming on.
It has been found that coronary patients generally are
uptight and tense. Biofeedback training can be used to help
*em learn to relax.
There has also been some work done in helping cerebral
Palsy victims gain control over their muscle spasms. In one
Procedure the victim's finger is connected to a device that
tellshim what his finger muscles are doing. He is first told to
trY to and control the large movements. When he gets these
under control he progresses to smaller and smaller move-
ments.
Biofeedback has also been suggested as a means of
Piping patients recover from muscle surgery. One of the
Problems in recovery is that the messages from the brain
to the muscles get mixed up. When the patient tries to
re'ax his muscles he tenses them instead. Biofeedback could
tea means of providing the brain with accurate information
a"d help the patient regain control over his muscles.
Modern prosthetic devices operate on the principle that
muscles are abundant with electric currents when they are
contracted. Sensors are placed near certain muscles on the
owner of the device to detect these currents. The actions
of the device are controlled by the signals it receives from
the sensors. In other words, the device is controlled by
manipulating the correct muscles. Biofeedback training can
be helpful in teaching the patient to control the muscles that
control such devices.
Biofeedback is also helpful in a form of psychotherapy
known as desensitization. In desensitization it is important
that the patient relax. When the patient is relaxed he is
confronted with situations which are particular problems
with him. For example, if the patient has a fear of crowds,
he is confronted with this situation and encouraged to talk
about it. The patient learns to confront the situation in
a relaxed manner and to cooly analyze it. This method is
particularly helpful in exorcising emotional devils. It is
important that the patient remain relaxed, this is where the
biofeedback comes in.
Controlling the Uncontrollable
As stated earlier, blood pressure and heartbeat were
traditionally considered autonomous body functions in
Western cultures. It was well known that they could be
manipulated by using the skeletal muscles; muscle tension
can raise blood pressure. What wasn't known is that both
could be manipulated without the use of skeletal muscles.
The experiment that proved this was done with rats.
The rats were paralyzed with an artificial curare, which is
an extremely powerful paralyzing drug. The rats had to
be put on artificial respirators to keep them alive. As a sys-
tem for rewarding the rats they were given a small electrical
shock in their brains at an area known to cause extreme
pleasure. The rats were divided into two groups; those who
were to learn to increase their pulse and those who were to
learn to decrease it. The results were successful. The rats
learned to do what they were supposed to. In other experi-
ments rats were trained to control their blood pressure
and in one of the more famous experiments the rats were
trained to control the blood pressure in each ear separately.
One ear would become pink and the other pale.
Some interesting side effects were observed from these
experiments. The rats which were trained to increase their
pulse still looked frightened a month after the experiment.
The rats which were taught to decrease their pulse suffered
deaths from heart failure or contracted cardiac disorders.
These results lead to some serious implications when
applied to humans. For one, it indicates what the effects
of social stress on humans might be. For another, it lends a
certain credibility to those stories about people dying of a
broken heart.
The adverse effects of such training when applied to
humans is uncertain, but some beneficial effects have
been demonstrated. Dr. Bernard Engel and Dr. Eugene
Bleecker in Baltimore trained eight heart patients with
premature ventricular contractions to control their heart-
beats. In another experiment patients with arterial fibrilla-
tion learned to raise and lower their pulse. Arterial fibrilla-
tion is when the upper chambers of the heart flutter wildly.
It was found raising and lowering their pulse prevented this
condition.

biofeedback will help control. A combined program of
biofeedback training to learn how to lower blood pressure
along with psychotherapy to eliminate problems and causes
of anxiety is proposed as a drug-free method of treating
hypertension.
Some of the more talented Yogis have reportedly been
able to stop their hearts. In one documented case a Yogi
raised his pulse to such a fantastically high rate that his
heart was effectively pumping no blood and held it in that
state for 17 seconds. The implication is that biofeedback
training may provide, for some, a quiet, painless, and
simple method of suicide. The hazards of biofeedback often
seem as numerous as the benefits.
A Warm Touch
Blood pressure and pulse are not the only parts of the
cardiovascular system that can be controlled, subjects have
been known to actually direct the flow of blood to
different parts of the body. In these experiments a skin
temperature sensor is used and the object is to raise the
temperature of the areas where the greatest flow of blood is
desired. If one were suffering from cold feet he could learn
to direct more blood to his feet and warm them. This is
similar to the experiment in which the rats flushed one ear
and blocked the flow of blood to the other. Some subjects
have been known to make one hand hot and the other hand
cold.
Controlling the blood flow can also be useful in con-
trolling migraine headaches. The throbbing headache pain is
caused by blood vessels being stretched by the flow of
blood. If more blood can be diverted to the limbs the
blood pressure in the head can be reduced and pain is re-
duced. The long range effects of diverting blood flow are
not fully known, there could be some danger in such proce-
dures.
Brain Waves
Brain waves are probably the most intriguing of all the
signals send out by the body. The actual concept of bio-
feedback grew out of brain wave research. The experiment
that led to the development of the concept was performed
by Dr. Brown in her lab at the V.A. hospital. She had wired
up several subjects to detect their alpha brain waves in
such a way that a blue light would turn on when the
subject was producing alpha waves. The subjects were to
watch the light and notice when it was on and try to relate
how they felt when the light was on. Dr. Brown discovered
that the amount of alpha waves they produced increased
with time. The production of alpha waves was associated
with feeling of relaxation (not sleep) and pleasure. Dr. Brown
came to the conclusion that the subjects were learning to
produce alpha.
Alpha waves are the easiest brain waves to detect of the
four different kinds, although they are not the most
common or the most frequent. The other three types of
waves are beta, delta, and theta. Alpha waves range in fre-
quency from eight to twelve cycles per second and are not
always present. Scientists have been trying to figure out
just what the presence of alpha waves indicates. As stated
above, alpha waves are generally associated with relaxation,
a tranquil alertness, or a heightened awareness of feelings
and senses, and have been associated with the eastern arts of
Zen, yoga, and other forms of meditation. Their association
with meditation has caused alpha wave biofeedback training
to become popularized in the last few years. Biofeedback
was heralded as a method of reaching instant nirvana, or at
least a method of learning the art of meditation quickly.
Some test subjects reported losing awareness of time and
environment when producing alpha. (More research is re-
quired before it is known if these effects are real or ima-
gined.) However, there is still a large amount of disagreement
as to what alpha waves originate from and whether they can
actually be controlled.
Experiments done by doctors D.A. Paskewitz and M.T.
Orne seem to indicate that alpha waves are associated with
visual processing. Instead of using a visual signal to inform
the subject when alpha was present, like the light Dr.
Brown used, they used an audio tone. This allowed the
experiment to be done with the subject's eyes closed. When
the subjects closed their eyes the level of alpha rose rapidly
and attained a peak. When the experiment was done with the
subjects' eyes open the level of alpha started out at a very
low level and gradually increased by several hundred per-
cent over a period of time. While the level of alpha increased
several hundred percent, it never reached the plateau quickly
attained with the eyes closed. The experimenters con-
jectured that alpha waves were caused by visual processing
in the brain. When the subjects had their eyes closed there
were no visual signals to process and therefore much alpha
was produced. When the subjects had their eyes opened
they learned to increase alpha by learning to block out the
visual signals. Dr. Brown associated the large amount of
alpha present when the eyes were closed to the fact that the
eye turns upwards when it is closed and that this action
produces alpha. Other scientists claim that eye movement is
not producing alpha but that it is easily mistaken for alpha.
In any case, the fact still remains that subjects who had their
eyes closed could not learn to increase alpha, while
subjects who had their eyes open did not increase alpha
beyond the level automatically achieved with their eyes
closed. This suggests that producing brain waves can not be
learned as Brown's research seemed to indicate.
The problem with analyzing anything to do with alpha
waves is that they are very complex. Alpha waves of
different frequency and intensity seem to have different
meanings. There also seems to be a dependence on the part
of the brain the alpha waves are taken from. To further
complicate things everyone has their own unique alpha
wave pattern. Since this is such a new area of research it will
probably be a long time before any conclusions are made.
Conclusion
This is by no means a complete treatise of the subject.
At present date literature on the subject is not very
abundant. Much of what is available is hard to locate or just
plain out of date. Biofeedback is a rapidly expanding field
which makes it difficult to follow. Perhaps, as some people
predict, these endeavors may one day lift mankind to un-
envisioned heights, or perhaps the results may prove
disastrous. In any event, you're liable to hear more about
it in the future and it's likely that biofeedback will become
a more controversial subject.

50 and 25
Years Ago
by Ray Barry
SO Years Ago
One of the biggest kicks we get from looking at old
issues of the Technic is noticing what the new technological
advances were, especially the ones which were considered
particularly exciting. The January issue from 1926 exhibits
some fairly good examples of this.
The following quote was taken from an article entitled
"The Conquest of Snow" which heralded the invention
of the first snowmobile. Notice the optimism and the
general feeling that progress is the fulfillment of man's
inevitable destiny to prevail over nature and rule the
universe (heavy, eh?).
Snow, one of the few remaining barriers to modern
transportation, is now under human control. No
longer will the trend of progress be restrained by the
dominance of this natural force over the intelligence
of man.
They had a quaint name for the device; it wasn't called
a snowmobile, it was called a snow-motor. It didn't look
much like present day snowmobiles either (basically it was
a converted tractor). Despite its primitive nature the
machine was quite impressive. According to the article it
was capable of hauling more than 80 tons of logs over
level ground, or more appropriately, level snow.
The snow-motor employed the principle of the "Archi-
median screw" (that is a direct quote). The device resembled
a small tractor with two torpedo shaped drums on either
side in place of wheels. On the outside of the drums was
wound a strip of metal called a skate. With this skate
attached to the drums they became gigantic screws. The
drums were oriented with their point forward: when the
drums were spun the machine was propelled forward.
Turns were accomplished by rotating the two drums at
different speeds.
The inventors would probably be disappointed to learn
how the great grandchild of their machine is misused today,
ravaging the woods, polluting the natural environment with
noise, and frightening its inhabitants.
Another of the recent technological advances, which
was reviewed in the same issue, was a device for making up
airship ballast while in flight. As can well be imagined,
lighter than air craft burn up thousands of pounds of fuel in
"'9ht and must somehow retain the proper ballast. The
helium used to inflate them is too expensive and rare to
exhaust in order to compensate for the lost fuel. The
problem was a perplexing one, however, there was a way
out. The exhaust of the engines proved to hold the answer.
In the process of burning the fuel about 1.4 pounds of water
is produced for every pound of fuel burned. Even an in-
efficient condenser could extract enough water from the
engine's exhaust to maintain even ballast. A gigantic
condenser was built to test the scheme and it proved tre-
mendously successful. Sheer ingenuity!
25 Years Ago
If any woman's lib advocates feel that they have made
little progress in the last twenty-five years it would lift their
spirits to read an article entitled "Engineering Coeds" pub-
lished in the January 1951 Technic. The article was written
by a woman engineering student about what it was like to
by a woman engineer. By today's standards her opinions
are awfully amazing, if not hopelessly chauvinistic. For
example:
I do not believe in an all-out crusade to increase the
enrollment of women in the engineering schools. I
think engineering is still a man's field and will con-
tinue to be so for a long time to come. Women have
invaded many fields that were thought to belong
entirely to the men, such as medicine, and law; how-
ever, engineering is unlike these professions in that
few women can ever become adept at it. It is much
easier to think of a woman doctor or lawyer than it is
to imagine a woman engineer.
If that didn't get you this next one will.
Instructors who have only men in their classes often
get in the habit of using rather profane language at
times and of course think nothing of it .... At one
meeting which I attended I was the only girl present.
During the course of the talk the speaker had used
several profane words. He finally looked at me and
said, "I notice there is a young lady present; you will
have to excuse me but I am talking to MEN and I
want to talk THEIR language." I was quite peeved but of course I said nothing.
That's real progress!

And Then What -2
by Jim Epperson
I first realized it while driving to work, flying down
1-84 at the blistering pace of 15 m.p.h. Something was
wrong-more so than usual, that is. It wasn't the traffic, or
the ungodly time (7:30 a.m.). Something was missing. The
whole experience had a sort of off-key, out of kilter deja-
vu about it. That should be normal, since I drove this way
to work every day, but it was anything but normal.
It wasn't until I came to the exit marked "1-91 North
-Bradley International Airport" that I realized what was
wrong. It was the first Tuesday in September; for the past
four years, I had been driving this route, taking that exit,
catching "Agony" Airlines flight 848, Hartford to Detroit,
and proceeding on to Ann Arbor. But now, having taken
a job just 45 miles from home, I drove the same roads to
work every day. My internal clock was still set on Student
Standard Time, and as I passed the exit I had to fight off
an involuntary urge to turn my Gremlin down the ramp and
head for the airport. As the exit faded away in my mirror
it finally struck me: I was out of school, out in the Real
World. Ye gods and little fishes, what a shock!
Now you might think that after four years frying my
brain at the Big U, I would rejoice at being "free." Sure,
it's great to be "outside," making bucks instead of paying
them out. But there was a lot to be missed. After all, what

instead of shouting "Go Blue!"?
One thing is for sure. The Real World is quite different
from the sheltered life of Academia, U.S.A. Oh, yes,
you've heard that so often you're sick of it, right? Well
pay heed, my friends; it may be a cliche, but it is all too
true.
Let's start with the little things. It is morning; early
morning. Your alarm clock begins its daily orgasm of
noise designed to ruin that blissful night's sleep. You eye it
malevolently across the room, thinking, "Do I have to go
to class? We aren't doing anything important today. I'll
get Bob to give me his notes." With that, you turn off
the electronic rooster, roll over, and go back to whatever
it was you were doing. However, out here in the R.W., the
dock screams, and the hustling (take that as you will)
young engineer jumps out of bed. Rise and shine at 6:30,
every day!!!
The next difference comes at the closet. The closet? you
ask. Listen, when blue jeans do not comprise your entire
wardrobe, it takes some thought (especially at 6:30 a.m.)
After all, one must match slacks, shirt, and tie (ugh!); after
four years of "jeans, blue" and "shirt, dirty" this decision
making process takes some time, although in my case it is
helped by the fact that I only own two ties, neither of which
match anything else that I wear.
Breakfast consists of one glass of O.J. (the liquid kind),
then it's out the door to do battle with the rest of Hartford's
commuters. Twenty minutes later, after riding the infinite
and divergent sequence of potholes known as 1-84, we plop
down in our» chair at The Job, ready (?) for another day's
exciting work.
Zzzzzzzz!
Here is the big difference. Not only are you totally un-
prepared for the kind of problem solving that industry
wants, but you are no longer master of your own fate. The
workload at school was neither light nor trivial, but at
least you could do the E.C.E. over a beer some night, and
read the Econ during the evening news. Unless you did all
your work from 8 to 5, and nothing else, you cannot be
ready for the continual eight hour grind. This takes getting
used to. Those extra hours between classes don't exist out
here-not even the ten minutes from one class to another.
Vacations, surprisingly, are few and far between. Oh, sure,
there are a few three-day weekends, but no Christmas vaca-
tion, no spring vacation, no summer vacation; only the two
weeks that are begrudgingly handed out annually. The year,
which formerly began in September and ended in May, has
no beginning and no end. That takes getting used to.
Even the days are different. Classes ended when you
wanted them to, sometimes as early as two or three in the
afternoon; now, you finish up with the others, at 5:00 p.m.,
*hen the flag is dropped and the great commuter race
begins.
(One small tip here: don't pick an apartment directly
wesf of your job. You get the rising sun in the morning, the
setting sun at night, and a headache all the time. Ever try
to drive blind through a 4:45 rush hour? 'Tis no fun, I can
assure you.)
Apartment dwelling is not much different, but it should
be a lot less expensive, except if you insist on trying to live
alone. However, unless you are living in another college
town, furniture will have to be bought, as there are few
furnished places. (I know of one recent graduate who at
last word was still living with only a bed and card table for
furniture.) Still, the overall cost of living will probably be
less, because of Ann Arbor's high prices. Your neighbors will
certainly be of a different stripe than before, and that can
force some adjustments: three young, single, and somewhat
rowdy engineers do not always get along in the staid
neighborhoods of Middle Class America. If you don't get
that hassle, you may get the Saturday morning kiddie
chorus blasting through your hangover (Northwood dwellers
know what that's like anyway).
You may get the idea that I'm sorry I ever left A2. Well,
yes and no (how's that for positive definiteness?). Regardless
of the town, there is a lot to be said for the academic life-
style, and being in Ann Arbor is only the icing on the cake.
On the other hand, it is nice to have a steady and sufficient
income. And there are some good elements to being on the
Outside. For one thing, even though your time from 8 to 5
belongs to the Company, your time afterwards is usually
your own, rather than being devoted to your five problem
sets and two papers. That alone is a luxury. Also, you'd
be surprised how much traveling can be done on even a
two-day weekend, especially if you can afford to fry.
The key to happiness and survival in the Real World
is The Job. The most obnoxious roommates and bitchiest
neighbors can be suffered if your work at least interests you;
conversely, even the most compatible roommates and con-
genial neighbors cannot make life bearable if one spends
eight hours a day slaving away at work that positively
bores him. Clearly, then, it would pay to be very careful in
your choice of job. Granted, the present employment
picture is such that you may not have a choice; but even
in the interviewing process, you can help yourself. First of
all, ask questions; many questions, both at the interview
and during the plant trip. Be sure you know what you are
going to be doing before committing yourself to an offer.
You may have to do a bit of research on the company in
order to ask intelligent questions, so do it. Check with any
of your profs who might have had dealings with the company.
This may all sound like a lot of work (which a senior
already has enough of), but you will be doing yourself a big
favor. Above all, don't be overwhelmed by the Great God
Greed. Sure money is a consideration, but what price
satisfaction? You could well end up the richest, unhappiest
S.O.B. around. And after four years of busting your ass to
get out into the Real World, that would be a real bummer.
It's all a memory now: the V-Bell, the Diag, the Arch;
watching the Big Blue charge out onto the Tartan Turf;
sitting in the Technic Office and watching the sun rise
over the Church St. parking structure. I was over the
Bulkeley Bridge by now, on Rte. 2. I downshifted the
Gremlin and took the Willow St. exit, passing under the
highway and cruising into the parking lot. It was a typi-
cally miserable New England morning, wet with cold, and
the Engineering Building was a good 150 yards away from
where I could park. Oh, well; another day, another dollar!

Letters to the Editor
To the Editor:
I would like to commend both Randy Warsaw and Doug
Johnson for the revealing article on PIRGIM: Public
Interest?, showing how certain critics of our technologies
go about raising public issues. It seems to me that every
engineer and every engineering student should read the
article and study it carefully. Because of our training, we
strive for accuracy, and for this we check, double check,
and even triple check our results, consequently, we assume
that members of the non-technical sectors of our society
are also equally responsible. The disconcerting fact brought
out by the Warsaw-Johnson article is that there are some
who rush to print to raise public issues without first
checking to see whether the printed information presents
technical facts in the proper technical context.
What I found most appalling was the fact that the
PIRGIM Projects Director, in preparing the report on
Fallout on the Freeway, did not even bother to go back to
the interviewed and quoted scientists and engineers before
printing the report. As the result, even the Kalamazoo
Gazette noticed one mistake. There are of course many
others, and the Michigan Technic noticed others.
If an accident involving the release of large quantities
of radioactive materials during transportation had actually
occurred, there could have been reasons to rush to print, and
under such conditions, perhaps mistakes made in reporting
should be forgiven. The fact, however, is that nothing
happened during the shipment of radioactive materials
from San Diego to the Michigan State University campus.
Furthermore, the quoted Ross report has to do with a
railroad accident—not an accident that might occur on
Michigan freeway—during a ten year period around the
Year 2000!
Why then was PIRGIM in such a hurry? Was PIRGIM
afraid to ask experts in the field to review the report before
Publication, as is done with professional publications?
It is time, it seems to me, that we start demanding that
our non-technical critics rise to our standards of carefulness.
Precision, thoroughness, and sense of social responsibility.
Prof. Chihiro Kikuchi
Dept. of Nuclear Engineering
To the Editor,
After two years at the College of Engineering, I have a
bone to pick with many of the college's professors; they
are lazy. Many professors are too lazy to write new tests
each semester. They just re-use the same tests from year
to year. Granted, some of the professors apply various
cosmetic alterations, like changing the numbers, but many
of them don't even do that.
The objective of testing is to evaluate a student's under-
standing of the course material. Yet, due to the laziness of
these professors, the test becomes more of an evaluation of
a student's ability to gain access to the professor's previous
tests than an evaluation of the student's scholasticism. Many
students who live in fraternities, dorms, or have friends who
have taken the course before, can gain access to the tests,
and therefore have an unfair advantage over the student
who cannot study from the tests. Testing under these
circumstances becomes a joke. The smartest student will no
longer, necessarily, receive the highest grade.
The continual re-use of the same test also places many
students in an unpleasant predicament. A group of students
may study the professor's previous tests together and
write up joint answers. Hence, their answers on the test
may be quite similar. The professor, upon noticing this,
submits the students' names to the Honor Council for
cheating. The student then faces possible disciplinary
action.
It is time that something be done about these lazy
professors. Engin Council tried to alleviate this problem
by setting up a test file, so all students could have access
to the previous tests. But most of the professors do not
contribute to the file. The problem now rests with the
administration. If the administration has any concern for
the quality of tests in the college, it should either force
the professors to change their tests at least every year
or two, or, more practically, force them to contribute to
the test file. This problem must be solved soon. It is unfair
to the students and it wastes Honor Council's time. It is
time that these professors come to the realization that if it
takes too much of their energy to write new tests every term,
maybe it takes too much of their energy to be a professor
and they should look for a simpler job, one they can handle.

"They must have dangled quite an apple in front of
Shakey's mouth to get him to work for the Technic"
exclaimed one passerby.
"No," replied Shakey, "they promised me a nose job.'

Hang in there, baby!
We have good news for you.
With a little cooperation on your part—more than a little,
actually—you will awaken to find yourself transformed into
a scarce commodity, which is even nicer than turning into a
lovely butterfly.
You will owe this good fortune to two notions, both false:
1) engineering has proved an evil profession, 2) therefore
engineering jobs are drying up. The prevalence of these
notions in some circles has cut down the competition for
your share of the action in the world.
Yes, there has been a slackening. There have been times
when an emerging engineer might have had a choice of 30
offers. Today it may be only 5 or 6. Check with your non-
engineering friends on campus how many offers of profes-
sional-level employment they get these days. But then they
maY not like engineering. (Switch out fast if you hate it
yourself.)
One rumor is true: that your engineering faculty, despite
their apparent friendliness, is out to make it as tough as
possible for you. It is your ability to survive their efforts to
grind you into the wall that makes you the precious com-
modity you are. Perhaps you already knew that.
And what's in it for you? Good access to the things that
money can buy and more of a chance than most people get
to shape the future as you think it ought to be shaped. We
are not the only organization that draws its decision-makers
from among those who came in expecting to spend their
careers contemplating engineering tables.
Nor are we the only company that could have signed this
ad. No matter how many offers you garner, you can accept
only one. A note about yourself is a first step toward deter-
mining whether that offer ought to be from us. Address it to
Kodak, Business and Technical Personnel, Rochester, N.Y.

We're looking for
engineers who were
born to lead.
Are you the kind of engineer who has what it takes to move into management someday?
If you are, you already know it.
Now what you need to know is which companies can offer you the best oppor-
tunities. We think you'll find General Electric is one.
We're a high technology company. And that means we have to have manag-
ers who understand technology—women and men —to run the place.
Today, over 60% of the top managers at General Electric hold technical
degrees. In fact, over 65% of the college graduates we hired last year held
technical degrees.
Of course, just leadership ability and a technical degree won't get
you into management. First, you're going to need solid engineering
experience and abroad understanding of business.
And we have a lot of ways to help you get it.
One is our Manufacturing Management Program. A two-year
program of rotating assignments that gives you broad experience
with different products and manufacturing processes.
Another is our Engineering Program. For engineers with an
interest in product and systems design and development.
There's also a Field Engineering Program, a Technical Market-
ing Program, plus a number of programs sponsored by product
operations.
And all with just one aim. To give you all the responsi-
bility and all the perspective you need to move into man-
agement. As fast as you can manage it.
Of course, starting on a program isn't the only way
to make it into management at GE. If you have a
specific product interest, we have many direct-
placement opportunities that can get your career
started fast, too.
What kinds of product areas can you
work in at GE?
Maybe nuclear power. Or more
efficient turbine-generators. Or better
mass-transit systems. Or medical
equipment. Engineering plastics.
Cleaner, quieter jet engines. Communi-
cations products. You name it.

Is the leg mightier than the atom?
Before you say no, keep in mind
that we know very little about many
forms of energy available to us.
Including good old muscle
power.
For too long a time we've relied
on oil and gas to serve our needs,
and failed to take full advantage of
other sources of power.
Including the atom.
But recent events make it clear
we must learn about all the options,
and how best to apply them.
At Union Carbide we're study-
ing a wide range of energy tech-
nologies and resources for the
Energy Research and Development
Administration.
From something as basic as bi-
cycling to the complexity of con-
trolling nuclear fusion.
For instance, we are learning
how to turn coal into oil and gas in
a way that is practical economically.
We're deeply involved in nuclear
research, particularly in finding
ways to make this important source
of energy safer and more efficient.
Our work in fusion power, at
Oak Ridge, Tennessee, offers the
most exciting possibility for the
future: the ultimate source of in-
exhaustible energy.
If we succeed, there will never
be another energy crisis.
But for the present, the answer
to our energy dilemma is not likely
to come from one source, but many.
All the way from the leg to the atom.

RECRUmNG ADS.
Not that recruiting ads are
misleading. They aren't.
But there's a special kind
of engineer who doesn't accept
what appears to be true on face
value. He accepts only what
he has verified for himself
firsthand.
And then uses what he's
learned as a springboard for
creative, innovative engi-
neering.
That kind of engineer is
our kind of engineer.
We're Combustion Engi-
neering. The Energy Systems
Company.
Over the past half century,
we've helped provide energy
for over 74 countries. In fact,
40% of the Free World's
thermo-electric power is pro-
duced with equipment of C-E
design.
But we want more engi-
neers, especially since there's
an energy shortage we're
trying to do something about.
C-E Lummus, for example,
recently created a clean-burn-
ing liquid fuel from coal that
meets EPA emissions
standards.
C-E Natco developed a
unique method of separating
oil from contaminants, making
it more feasible to recover
oil too costly to recover before.
C-E Crest is designing
better systems to handle gas
and oil, on-shore and off-shore.
C-E Power Systems is
engineering ways to make
more efficient use of fossil
and nuclear energy for today's
needs and tomorrow's.
At C-E, we offer more than
jobs. We offer creative engi-
neers the chance to show the
world what they can do. And
if you're still skeptical about
us, maybe you're the kind of

This month we have put together a rather special issue.
It has been some time since the Technic has focused much
attention right here at home base, the College of Engineering.
This month should make up for that. As indicated by our
cover, we are focusing our attention on the North Campus
move, what's happening, why, and some of the different
viewpoints on it.
We start out with an article by the student representative
for input to the North Campus planning Committee, Randy
Force. Randy has compiled a current account of plans, ideas
and dreams. As the student representative Randy has the
inside scoop on all of that jazz. Randy has also pilfered
some artist's conceptions, these aren't final plans mind you,
just ideas floating around in the nebuli. Randy is a
Mechanical Engineering Senior.
Following that we have a special Technic interview with
your and my favorite Dean, David V. Ragone. Ray Barry
and Randy Warsaw, investigative reporters (equal to Wood-
ward and Burstein, no less) bore the cold winter winds
between East and West Engin. for a discussion on North
Campus in the Dean's cozy office. Ray and Randy posed a
number of questions which they considered of interest to
which the Dean responded. The results are herewith
printed. Ray and Randy are both regular staff members, if
you've seen the Technic before, you know them both.
There were a number of things that came up in the
interview with Dean Ragone which required response from
the University, so we sent rookie Bill Chomic to Vice-
President Pierpont's office. Vice-President Pierpont is the
Chief Financial Officer for the University and responded
to some of Bill's questions. The Article resulting is called
"North Campus Commitment by the University." Bill is a
Senior in Materials. This is his first time on the Technic
line-up.
To express an opposition point of view we selected Prof.
Walter Debler. Lately, there has been a rising opposition tc
the North Campus move. Prof. Debler has been one of the
most vocal of the opponents, so we asked him to outline
his position for us. Before you count him off as a reaction-
ist, read the article, you will find it interesting. Prof. Debler
hails from the Applied Mechanics Dept.
To find out just what the faculty sentiment was concer-
ning the North Campus move, we sent out a survey. The
response to the survey was surprisingly good. The survey was
prepared and reported by Angelo Muzzin. This is Angelo's
second outing with the Technic, but he has been active in
the background for much longer, balancing the books to
suite his taste.
Finally, Ray Barry, the infamous author of 'The Good
Old Days" has prepared something special this month. After
some digging around Ray found some old photo's of North
Campus, and has compiled a photographic history of North
Campus.

the problems, but how can you check yourself if there are
no answers?
Don't you just hate teachers who cover material on a test
that was just covered in the last lecture, not even giving
you time to become familiar with it?
Don't you just hate lab instructors who design labs without
the level of the majority of students in mind?
Don't you just hate it when a lab scheduled for three hours
takes eight, and then the course is only worth two credits?
Don't you just hate professors who think their course is the
most important course for every student?
Don't you just hate professors who think their course is the
only one?
Don't you just hate graduation requirements that make it
impossible to graduate in four years. And don't you just
hate how they make it look in the catalogue (i.e. that you
really can graduate in four years).
And don't you just hate how they insist a five years pro-
gram is not necessary while most students end up taking at
least four and a half?
Don't you just hate it when a professor tells you to ignore
certain aspects of a problem, and then tests you on them?
Don't you just hate staying up to 5:00am finishing a
homework assignment only to have the professor postpone
the due date?
Don't you just hate lab instructors who assume you already
know what you're supposed to be learning?
Don't you just hate it when you flunk the first test but
don't find out until after the last day to drop it?
Don't you just hate professors who consider something
simple, about which you haven't the slightest notion?
Don't you just hate professors who assume you've taken
a course you never heard of?
Don't you just hate counselors who think they know your
limitations better than you do?
Don't you just hate professors who lecture into your next
class?
Don't you just hate the way they encourage you to partici-
pate in extracurricular activities while piling on so much
work that you couldn't possibly?
Don't you just hate professors who decide not to follow the
course description in the catalogue, especially when the
course is a prerequisite?
Don't you just hate professors who can't work an example
right out of the book (especially when they wrote the book)?
Don't you just hate having your computer account cut in
half?
Don't you just hate it when an unfinished example done in
class appears on the exam?
Don't you just hate it when you are filling out employment
forms which ask for academic referrals and you realize
you don't know any professors to ask?
Don't you just hate the phrase "The student can readily
show ...."?
By now, don't you just hate the phrase "Don't you just
hate"?

The Move to North Campus:
Where Are We Now?
Think a minute about the industry you hope to join
upon graduation. Now, did that industry even exist in
1904? If it did chances are it was small. There were no
Computer, Nuclear, Aerospace, Environmental, or Industrial
Engineers. In fact, special titles hardly existed. It was in
1904 that the brand new Engineering Building, which we
now call West Engineering, was opened and 993 students
moved in. The College has grown since then (now over
3000 undergraduates and nearly 1000 graduate students),
but more importantly, engineering has grown -tremendously!
Nearly thirty years ago the decision was made to
eventually relocate the College of Engineering on the newly
acquired North Campus. Since that time all of the College's
expansion has been on the North Campus. Twelve buildings
on the North Campus are now occupied primarily by the
College. In terms of activities the College is neatly divided
in half.
In April of 1974 at a special rally in Chrysler Center,
Dean D.V. Ragone kicked-off the Capital Campaign program
aimed at completing the move to the North Campus. The
College is seeking $12,000,000 toward new buildings and
equipment and $8,000,000 for endowments. To date the
Capital Campaign Committee has received over $11,000,000
from interested foundations, companies,alumni, and faculty.
While these figures sound impressive, they are not nearly
enough to build the facilities required by the College.
Over half the construction funds must come from tne
State of Michigan. Pick up any newspaper, it will tell you °t
the financial problems of this state. These economic woes
may delay the construction program.
The problems and considerations in the move to the
North Campus go beyond finances. For one, there are the
buildings themselves. Professor L.M. Jones of the Aerospace
and the Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences departments
chairs the Facilities Planning Committee that has been
working for two and a half years on the logistics of tne
move, which will ultimately determine the plans fortfie
buildings. At their present stage the plans call for a lar9
8
Michigan Technic


Industrial Engineering, Humanities, Applied Mechanics and
Engineering Sciences, the College Administration, and a
new Instructional Media Center. In addition plans are
for two smaller buildings. One for Materials and Metallurgi-
cal Engineering and Chemical Engineering, and one for
Electrical and Computer Engineering. The Naval Archi-
tects are hoping to add their own new classroom and
towing tank building. Besides these engineering buildings
there will be a need for a major North Campus library to
serve all the North Campus schools.
Then, there is the problem of our-old real estate. The
Psychology Department has spoken for the newer East
Engineering building, but inspite of the Technic's attempts
to sell the older West Engineering last year, no "buyer"
has yet been found. The building needs extensive refur-
bishing and roof repairs, and too, not everyone needs a
swimming pool in the basement. Still, West Engineering
remains one of the most majestic buildings on this campus.
By far the largest part of the planned construction pro-
gram is "Building I". This facility is intended to house the
Departments of Civil, Mechanical, and Industrial Engineering;
Humanities, Applied Mechanics, and Engineering Sciences.
This building is also planned to contain the Engineering
College Administration and the proposed Instructional
Media Center. The estimated cost to house all of these is
fifteen million dollars. This compares to the one quarter of
a million dollars to build West Engineering between 1902
and 1904. One proposal is for this to be a six story building
located between the G.G. Brown Laboratory and the
Automotive Engineering Laboratory. In this position it will
form the center of the new Engineering College.
The departments of Mechanical Engineering and Civil
Engineering are currently the most divided. Mechanical
Engineering is divided almost equally over four buildings
on two campuses! Building I will reunite these departments
at one location.
The departments of Humanities and Applied Mechanics
and Engineering Sciences have been included in this first
building due to their role as service departments. Both
offer several courses required for all engineering students.
By moving these departments and the Administration it is
hoped to establish the center of the College on the North
Campus. Industrial Engineering has been included because
their space requirements fit in well with the other units.
Included with the Engineering College Administration in
the Prospectus for Building I are offices for the Mathematics
Professors and teaching assistants now located in West
Engineering. Also included are facilities for alumni relations
and the college wide student societies. These organizations
include; Engineering Council, Datum-Technic, Tau Beta Pi,
Vulcans, S.W.E., and S.M.E.S. Current plans would locate
these student offices in a cluster around a small student
lounge. Those student organizations associated with indivi-

dual departments (e.g. IEEE) will have offices in a student
area within the department. Each of these student areas
will include a reference room, study area, computation
room, and a lounge. This system of departmental lounges
is seen as a better alternative to one large lounge, as in West
Engineering.
The last intended occupant of Building I is the Instruc-
tional Media Center. This is an exciting idea for using some
of the technology engineers helped develop as an aid in our
education. The faculty would be an expansion from the
College's present Instruction Television system. Besides
continuation of televised courses to engineers in industry,
the center would provide facilities for computer aided in-
struction, computer graphics, and increased audio/visual
equipment to aid instructors. The computer aided instruc-
tion concept allows the student individually take lessons
or study with the aid of a computer. Private carrels would
be used for this purpose. A similar facility is currently at
use in the School of Dentistry.,
Building II is planned to house the departments of
Chemical Engineering and Materials and Metallurgical En-
gineering. In October the Herbert H. and Grace A. Dow
Foundation of Midland gave the College of Engineering
$4,000,000 toward the funding of this building. This is
the largest private gift ever made to the College, conse-
quently this building will be named after Herbert H. Dow.
With these funds the Dow building is hardly number two
anymore; the College now hopes it can be constructed
simultaneously with Building I.
With the departments of Nuclear Engineering, Aerospace
Engineering, and Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences already
on the North Campus, only Electrical and Computer
Engineering and Naval Architecture would remain on the
Central Campus. Building III is planned to house Electrical
and Computer Engineering and possibly additional spaces for
Nuclear Engineering. The Naval Architects are conducting
their own capital campaign and hope to raise all the funds
needed to construct a new home on the North Campus.
This would include, of course, more, bigger and better test
tanks.
When will all this happen? Well, unless your stay here
is longer than most, you will never have a class in one of
these buildings. The administration is hoping that Building
I and the Dow Building can be ready for the Fall, 1979
semester. But a project of this magnitude involves many
steps, state approval and funding is needed before each
phase can procede. The buildings have not yet even reached
the drafting table.
If the Engineering College on the North Campus is
going to be a real improvement over our present situation
many things are needed besides just these four buildings.
There are all the things to add life to a campus. Businesses
from banks to bars, improved housing and transportation,
and perhaps a Mini-Union. Where can we put an Arch;
after all, it is the College's traditional symbol?
The lifestyle on the North Campus five years from now
depends greatly on what the students, faculty and admini-
stration do now. The planners like Professor Jones and
Dean Ragone have been thinking about this for years. The
faculty interest and concern has increased greatly in the
last year. At meetings where the subject has been presented,
students have shown a concern for the environment that
future students will come to. All of this mutual concern
should not go wasted. Professor R.P. Weeks of the
Humanities Department is chairing a committee on the
North Campus Environment. This committee is composed
of faculty members, students, and representatives from
the other schools on the North Campus. They will be
10
Michigan Technic


be made in the North Campus environment and lifestyle.
Among the issues to be examined by this committee
are transportation (anyone got 10 million for a monorail?),
establishing a commercial zone, and recreation. They are
also good people to send suggestions for improving the
College's facilities. Suggestions pertaining to the Engineering
College's planned facilities may also be sent to the Facilities
Planning Committee, either through Professor Jones or
through Engineering Council.
Stronger ties need to be developed between the North
Campus and the Central Campus. On the other hand students
should not have to make 6 bus trips a day back and forth
between the campuses. The College is now looking for ways
to offer introductory Chemistry and Physics on the North
Campus. This should make life easier for the freshpersons
and sophomores. The transportation load is reduced if most
required courses can be offered on the North Campus.
However, students should be encouraged to take the
broadening courses offered on the Central Campus and to
continue to use the better living and recreational facilities
there. The Engineering student desiring the best education
will be active on both campuses.
There are two buildings that could do much to improve
the North Campus. A major North Campus library is an
obvious need. Perhaps not so apparent is the need for an
Engineers Club or Mini-Union. Both of these are places
to go when not in class and would serve to bring students
closer together.
The future need for a major library on the North
Campus has long been seen. But its time will not come
until the engineers have arrived to triple the current
population studying there. Hopefully a library to serve
Music, Art, Architecture, and Engineering can be construc-
ted a year or two after our Buildings I and II. In the interim
the College will have to depend on the small North Engin-
eering Library and the planned departmental reference
rooms.
An Engineer's Club, patterned after the Lawyer's Club,
would offer recreation areas, some sort of snack bar or
dining area, and a major hall. Such a facility could be used
for a wide range of special events including meetings
and Engineering Council sponsored TGs and dances. As a
social center it might become a focal point of the college.
To enhance this an old style Engin Arch might be included
in the architecture. The state will not fund a social building,
so all funds must come from private sources. The College
might be talked into a funding drive after the current
capital campaign or perhaps the engineering students could
work to raise the funds. After all the funding drive for the
Michigan Union was initiated by student organizations.
The College of Engineering is more than just buildings.
Students are an important part and most students would
Probably say that the faculty are the most important part.
E'ght million dollars of the Capital Campaign goal of
twenty million is intended for endowments and scholarships.
The endowed faculty chairs will aid attracting the country's
test engineering professors. The scholarship funds will
certainly be important to many students.
The sketches that appear here artist's conceptions done
by Swanson Associates (architects) to assist the College's
Capital Campaign Committee. This committee does not
design, but to a large extent the final project depends on
their efforts. The state will provide some of the funding,
but will most likely only fund vital needs. What we end up
above these in niceties, conveniences, and specialties will
depend on the success of the capital campaign.

On North Campus
-A Teehnie Interview
by Ray Barry and Randy Warsaw
Technic: Are there any plans to improve the transportation
service between Central Campus and North Campus when
the Engineering College moves out there?
Ragone: Well, there just has to be some kind of an
improvement in the bus system. The problem is: What can
I promise you? You ask the question as if I control it. I
don't.
Technic: We realize you don't control it. We would like
to know if somebody is trying to do something about it.
Ragone: You have to understand how a university
operates. There is a political system within the University.
Getting things to run your way, getting the things you want
done involves getting your thoughts, desires, or what have
you in front of those guys that made the decisions on it.
Now there is a committee on the North Campus environment.
The reason for setting up such a committee is that there
are a number of questions, transportation is just one of
them. How about a commercial zone up there? Just how
are we going to live out there? I think when we go out
there we're going to start to put a real strain on the
system, transportation being just one of them.
How about the questions of where to buy books?
Where are we going to buy a beer? Where are we going to
sit down and have a cup of coffee? I, for one, don't care
how good or bad any one particular eating place is, I think
there ought to be alternatives to give people the opportunity
to select. If we could pick up South U. and take it with us,
I'd like that. It's a nice little shopping area, it's comfortable,
and we know it. So somehow, we're going to have to &lt;io
some planning for how we live out there. That includes
some way to buy little odds and ends, some way to bank, a
post office, how we get back and forth, the whole question.
Now,the way you ask the question: What am I 9°in9
to do about it? Well, OK, I can thump my chest and say,
'I'm going to do this, that and the other thing. But it
really doesn't mean a thing, really. It takes a number o
people. It's the students and the faculty, that's where the
strength of this move has to come from. The students an

take it with us, I'd like that. It's a nice
littleshoppingarea,it'scomfortable,andweknow it.'
the faculty must say, 'We really want a pleasant environment
out there, an useful environment, one in which we can live,
and then, 'let's see what it takes.' You know that when
you have a political force of that kind you have a much
better chance of getting it.
I could go in and talk to Mr. Weienbach, or whoever it is
that runs the bus service, I could send all the reports to Mr.
Pierpont, or some place or another, everybody else yells at
them, too. Well, so they try their best. What we have to do is
present a very serious, cogent case for the fact that we are
going to need a much better system, a much better way of
getting back and forth. You can think of all kinds of ways
of improving the present bus system. Life, how about
widening that road, having a dedicated bus lane. That makes
good sense. I'm no transportation expert, but the business
of putting up a monorail, or something like that, is kind of
far fetched. It's five or six million dollars a mile, and it's a
couple of miles between here and North Campus. Nobody
is going to find that kind of money in the near term. But
there are some real improvements that could be made for not
that much money.
Technic: You say you are forming a committee to look into
these problems, that leads to the question of how much
power is this committee going to have, what ability are
they going to have to solve them? All they can do is make
suggestions.
Ragone: So can anybody else. In any political system,
especially around universities, power belongs to those who
take it. In advance of any of their recommendations you
can't say what kind of power they are going to have. If they
"lake completely ridiculous suggestions no one will listen to
*em. If they make good, strong suggestions that really are
wll thought out people will listen. Let's take the commer-
cial zone, for example. If someone stands up and says, 'We
ought to have a commercial zone, let's tell all these people
out here to shut down and move up to North Campus, - now
that is nonsense, and nobody will listen to that. Suppose
you came up with a business plan. There are two alterna-
tives: You either lease them the land, or you build
Gildings and lease them the buildings. This is the kind of
pro-form of balance sheet you could come up with and it
would show that it's a reasonable economic proposition.
People will listen to that. So the question as to how much
Power they are going to have: They are going to have as
much power as they can generate.
Technic: Sure, people will listen. But say they suggest
something that is going to take some money. What are they
9oing to do. From that point they are under the control of
whoever says, 'We can't afford the money for that even
though we think it is a needed improvement or a good idea,
"agone: That's the same situation everybody else has
around here. Universities operate that way. I can go in and
ask for money for a new assistant professor, I don't have
anV power. Sometimes I get it, sometimes I don't. It
March 1976
depends on how strong my argument is relative to the
arguments of the Lit. School. There is no such thing as
power in advance. It doesn't happen with me either. I've
got a certain amount of money already, I've got to convince
the state legislature to come up with the rest. What power
do I have? None, except persuasion.
As far as I'm concerned, we appointed the committee
within the College of Engineering, in that sense they've got
some power around here. I've got to read their report, or
I've got to listen to them simply because I commissioned
the group and said, 'Please won't you tell us what to do.'
Now, what will I do with the information? It depends on
what ideas they have. If we've got the dough, as much
money as we can muster for ourselves, then fine. By and
large, the kinds of things we're talking about (the North
Campus environment) will mean University commitment
more than College commitment. That's going to depend on
our ability to convince people.
Technic: Would it be more energy efficient to build a
single structure than it is to build four separate buildings?
Ragone: No, you are thinking in kind of straightforward,
what we call elementary heat transfer terms. That is, you're
thinking in terms of surface to volume ratio. People have to
live in these buildings and people want to look outside, how
about having no windows? That's much more efficient. Even
if you had all the departments in one building it doesn't tell
you anything about energy efficiency. There is a certain
amount of outside surface required just for living.
Technic: Are there any plans for having a library up there?
Ragone: There is a North Campus library that is on the

FORTHE LAST 100 YEAR
And we're still working on it
You see, the invention of the telephone didn't stop with Alexander
Graham Bell. It just started.
Because the telephone is just the beginning of a telephone call.
Ifs part of an intricate network of a trillion parts and nearly
a billion miles of circuits.
To build this network, we at Bell Labs and Western
Electric have long worked as a team with AT&amp;T and your
Bell telephone company.
As a result, America has the best telecommunications
system in the world.
And the world has the benefits of such Bell System
innovations as the transistor, the coaxial cable and direct
distance dialing.
Working together, we've created entirely new communi-
cation systems. Like our latest switching machine that can
route 550,000 calls an hour.
At the same time, we're constantly improving existing
systems. Like tripling the capacity of our major microwave radio
system in the last ten years.
Even the standard telephone that you probably think never
changes has had virtually every major part improved since 1972.
In fact, we've made more than 2,500 improvements in your
phone in the last twenty-five years.
Not just to make it look different. But to make it work better.
And to keep its cost down.
Improvements like these don't just happen.
The Bell System invests more than $750 million a year
in research and development.
As an outgrowth, we receive an average of more than
two patents every working day. And nearly half the things
Western Electric will make this year didn't even
exist four years ago.
In the next 10 years, we plan to
expand the capacity of the telephone
network as much as we have in the
past 100 years.
To keep this network operating and
growing takes the innovative teamwork
of Bell Labs and Western Electric.
The kind of innovative teamwork
that makes us say:
One Bell System. It works.

books now, and up in front of the legislature. I don't
know when it is "going to be funded. My guess is that it
won't be funded before our two buildings are funded. How
soon after that? I don't know. That could be a problem.
Of course, there is a small library up there. It's in 1ST. It's
too small, really. There ought to be, I think, every effort
made to move the Engineering library up there. But no
matter what you do the Engineering buildings and the
library will never move at the same time. So as a way to
compensate for that, or to accomodate that sort of
mismatch in time, and then, in the long run, to provide a
place where people can just sit and study we are planning
the following: The idea is to have a student service center
in every department that acts as a place where people can see
their program advisor, professional societies can be there,
and a reading room and a small library.
Technic: We'd like to go back for a second and look at
the energy considerations. We're wondering what this move
will do to the energy bill of the University. What will it
cost to heat and cool these buildings?
Ragone: In that you're building more buildings, it is
going to cost more.
Technic: Is this wise now that we have an "energy crisis?"
Ragone: It depends upon what these present buildings are
going to be used for. Are you going to stop all growth or any
progress in the United States? How about stopping all
building in the United States? That's a way to save energy.
It's also a way to bring the whole economy down. I would
tend to say, 'Well, look, it depends on the use to which these
buildings are put.' Let me postulate. If West Engin. were to
become a storage building for the libraries it wouldn't
have to be heated as much as it is now. I'd bet we'd come
out saving energy because this thing is a sieve energy-wise.
If it turns out that these buildings are completely occupied
the minute we leave, where do those people come from? In
other words, if there is pressure to build somewhere in the
University, then it was a question of either we were going to
build a building or somebody else is going to build a
building. Then it's a toss up.
Technic: Yes, but is the University able to afford this with
rising energy costs?
Ragone: I guess you could say they wouldn't let me build
it unless they could. In general, in terms of the operation of
the Engineering School, we're going to end up cheaper out
there because they will be newer buildings and they will
be better insulated and better designed than these.
Technic: Is the budget balanced that way?
Ragone: No. As far the Engineering School is concerned,
we're going to be all right. As far as the University is
concerned, it's going to cost more. The University has
just built two recreational facilities, is that going to cost
more money? The University is going out for $140 million
for a new hospital, where are they going to get the money
to run that?
Let me just make my little speech of what I'm worried
about with the College. There are three things you can
control around this place: faculty, students, and physical
facilities. From there on in the system runs. Deans,
department chairmen can't do a thing. It just goes. The
reputation of the place depends upon what these three
independent elements do when they get in and mix it up.
We're having troubles in all three dimensions, I think.
We're getting budget cuts up one side and down the other
on faculty. You've probably noticed larger classes. Classes
are going to be cancelled because we can't get enough
students in them. Unless they get up to a certain size we
can't afford to teach them. In the Capital Campaign we're
going out to alleviate that to some extent. We're trying to
get some endowed shares with which to retain some really
outstanding faculty during this down period. I think students
are a very important part of educational atmosphere around
here. You learn as much from students as you do from
faculty. How do we attract very, very good undergraduate
and graduate students? With scholarships. Somehow we've
got to compete with MIT, Berkley, and Stanford: The
big cats, and cats that are in our league by and large.
With physical facilities it's the same sort of thing. Have
you gone around and looked at what MIT is doing in terms
of building? Stanford? Berkley? Illinois? Purdue? We have
fallen behind. The expenditures over the last five to ten
years for capital equipment and buildings are way down.
There was a time when The University of Michigan was one
of the great places in terms of buildings: When West Engin.

was built in 1904, this was it, bigger and better than any
school in the country. That isn't true any more. And
there is the question of just plain reputation. If we sit
back and take the attitude that we're here, we are meeting
expenses, and we're comfortable Oh! We'll be all
right, but we'll be 5th or 6th this year, 7th or 8th next year,
tenth of twelth the year after that and it's going to get to be
a terribly dull place to be. And I'm not just going to let
that happen. You don't stand still in any of this business.
Your reputation doesn't stand still. You've got to run like
the devil in order to stay with the pack or get out ahead
of them.
One could easily ask the question: What's reputation
about? Reputation is what brings bright, active faculty and
students, which are what makes the place intellectually
alive. And as graduates of the place, what's it worth? If
you're from a good engineering school that carries a certain
amount of weight. Our reputation goes with you. So it's
easy to sit back and say, 'Just let it go by and we'll save
energy .... 'Well, the hell with that, that's my attitude.
Technic: The traffic situation is another concern. There
will be many more cars going out to North Campus,
coming from all directions. A lot of it will be coming down
Fuller, Ann, and Catherine streets. These same streets are
being heavily used by hospital traffic. During rush hour
it's a disaster area. We were wondering what is going to
happen in this area.
Ragone: There have been some traffic studies done by the
People at the University Planners Office. There have been
traffic studies concerning widening Geddes-Fuller which
would make an enormous difference. Studies have been
TOde, people are talking about it. I don't know where the
Plans are. I guess I'll believe it when I see the road being
widened.
Technic: Is it up to the city to widen the road?
Ragone: I think it is a little more complex than that. The
city is involved and the county is involved too. It's a messy
°ne. In any of this business you'd like to do it to anticipate.
Good engineering would anticipate these troubles. You can
Project what it's going to be like and plan for it. Society
doesn't always run that way. Political systems often wait
for the scream. That is part of this committee (on North
Campus Environment). What I'm trying to get at is to
start a little attention to those subjects before we get out
there. I've asked three people; one from Art, one from
Architecture and one from Music, all professors, to be on
this committee because they live on the North Campus. If
we can set this up as a committee, and in a responsible way,
tort making some noise early we're liable to get that done
a '°t earlier than would otherwise, happen. Let's look at
*e situation, let's anticipate, let's make some of those
n°ises now, before we get out there.
'ethnic: v\/e were also wonderipg about the parking.
Ra9one: That's the same thing: University Planners Office.
That ought to be integrated into the whole thing. There are
studies that have been done. Whether anybody is going
to do anything about it depends on the pressure.
Technic: We were wondering what your thoughts were
on the isolation that would be caused by our moving to
North Campus. It has been said that the isolation would
be bad for the academic atmosphere. The lines of com-
munication between the Engineering School and the other
schools would be pretty much severed.
Ragone: I guess I would react in this way: It is unfortunate.
We are a university. One of the great advantages of a univer-
sity is that there are a variety of people around. But when
you take a look at what it takes to go between, for example,
the Chemistry Department and the Chem. Engin. Depart-
ment . . . there should be an enormous interchange. There
isn't. I guess my attitude is that you see these people
socially, when an event is important enough people go,
but inhibitive geographical separations already exist on this
campus. How many of our people interact with Physics, for
example? Very few. We just had an accreditation visit from
the ECPD (Engineering Council for Professional Develop-
ment). One of their comments was that there was very
little interaction on this campus between the Engineering
School and the Math Department, the Physics Department,
the Chemistry Department. It's been that way for many
years. It's unfortunate, but isolation in that sense exists now.
Moving out to North Campus isn't going to make a bit of
difference with that.
Technic: Another problem is that it is going to be a real
pain in the neck, especially for Freshpersons, jumping
between campuses all the time. What is the possibility of
holding math and chemistry sections and the like out on
North Campus.
Ragone: We have already talked to a representative from
the Math Department. There are a number of Math
Department professors who have offices on the third floor
of West Engin. We plan to take them with us. We are
planning offices in our buildings out there to give them some
offices with us. They may want to either live with us full
time or they may just want to hang their hat there. The
general thought is that most of the math courses will be
taught out there. As far as Chemistry and Physics go, I don't
know about those. I don't think we'd have any trouble with
the lectures, it's the question of the laboratories. If we
could design and build a chemistry lab into our buildings,
I'd like that. I don't know whether we're going to have that
much money.
There are all kinds of schemes that could be worked up.
It's all a matter of moving images instead of people. One way
to solve the transportation problem is this: while a
chemistry lecture is being given here, there could be a class
out on North Campus where people sit and watch the
lecture on TV at the same time. Is that so bad? I'm not so
sure it is. I think that could be worked out rather well.

is going to be funded. My guess is that it won't
be funded before our two buildings are funded.'
Technic: That might cause a few problems like hiring some
people to operate the equipment.
Ragone: Yes, it could also solve a number of problems.
It doesn't cost us that much. We do it. Our system breaks
even. By sending over the wires to Detroit it is no cost to
the College. You'd have to have, for example, in a Chemistry
lecture, TV cameras on the lecturer and you'd have to have
someone to run them. But, you know, one of the other
problems they have in chemistry is the multiple lecture
sections, they can't get enough people in. Here is one way
to break the bind, a bind they have already.
It depends on the subject, but if you were studying
something like metallurgy or botany where you had to
zero in, or some of the chemistry experiments where you
really focus in there could be a real advantage here. In
metallurgy where you're talking about looking through a
microscope, or in botany where you want to look through a
microscope; you never see these except in slides, well heck,
that is easy to do on TV.
I react and perhaps over-react. There seems to be such a
fear of 'My God! There will be a change!' Of course there
will be a change, the point is to maximize your own benefits
during change. The chemistry example is one. There is liable
to be all kinds of things we can do. Once you've got that
lecture going over the circuit, why not tape it? You can see
it at 8:00, or 9:00, or 10:00, or 11:00, or go for lunch or
something. That kind of degree of freedom is the kind of
thing I think we can achieve.
One of the things we're trying to put in is called a media
center. It consists of a number of TV carrels where you can
go and watch TV tapes of a lecture or experiment. The
Dental school has a magnificent set-up where the lectures on
various subjects are available and you can go and watch
them. I would say, if in the process of moving to North
Campus we took an exact replica of what we had here and
moved it over, we would be pretty dumb. What you've got
to do is start from scratch. What is it you want? What is
teaching going to be like 20 to 30 years from now? What
kinds of devices are we going to have? You're going to put
some high speed lines in all over the place no matter what
so you can have communication lines, so you can have
computers in every class, so that you can pipe things
around. I don't know what's coming in the next 20 years,
but whatever it is, let's loosen up to the point where we can
easily pipe things around these buildings. Take advantage
of the move.
This decision to move was made before I arrived on
campus in '53. The decision was already made before then,
we built the Mortimer Cooley building out there and it was
finished in 1953-54. We were committed right then. The
Mechanical Engineering Department is split. We've got half
out there and half in here. I think that's more serious than
worrying whether you're going to talk to the philosophers.
I have nothing against philosophers, I happen to like them.
But having the Mechanical Engineering Department split
in two, and the Civil Department split, and the Water
Resources Department split, I think that's more serious,
intellectually, then worrying about whether you're going to
talk to the rest of the campus.
Technic: But back in 1953, were they really committed to
move? One alternative might have been to have all the high
level research and graduate work out there and under-
graduate work on Central Campus.
Ragone: That's a mistake. I can make you an argument
against that. I think that's an intellectual split you don't
want to make. I think the undergraduate-graduate interaction
should be strong. One of the reasons for having a fine
research institution, and we're a research oriented university,
is for the spinoff you get for the undergraduate. If you go
through your undergraduate career and never get any
notion that there is research going on you've really wasted
a great opportunity that you had because it's here and you
should take advantage of it. You have to ask what you are
going to split? Where are you going to draw the boundary.
If you ask me, 'Do you draw the boundary between
undergraduate and graduate vs. the College of Engineering
and the rest of the place, 'I'd say, 'For God's sake don't
tear the College apart.' I think those intellectual bonds
within the College are much stronger.

Commitment by the University
During the interview with Dean Ragone about the move
to North Campus by the Engineering College, several
questions were raised that the Staff of the Technic felt
needed further clarification. These included issues on
student transportation, parking on North Campus, and a
commercial zone on North Campus. For further answers to
these questions Vice-President Pierpont, the chief financial
officer of the University, was sought out to provide the
Technic with this information. A synopsis of that interview
is presented here to help clarify previous interviews and
information.
Concerning student transportation we asked Vice-Presi-
dent Pierpont about the state of the present bus system and
future plans for the system, as well as alternate systems of
moving students to and from North Campus. He indicated
to us that a great deal of thought is going into ideas to
improve the present bus system. With the main concern
being that expansion of the service will be necessary to
handle the additional students using the system when the
Engineering College moves to North Campus. Vice-President
Pierpont indicated to Technic that scheduling of these
services to be a critical point A point that needs further
study to work out He assures us that everything possible
will be done to insure students adequate transportation to
9etto class easily and on time. Assurance was also granted
fiat adequate amounts of money would be allotted to
^ieve these goals.
Another area that Technic queried Vice-President Pierpont
«»ut was that of alternate modes of transportation to
North Campus. The Vice-President informed us that other
systems were indeed being- considered, but the major
Problem that arises is cost. Of all the systems studied or
under scrutiny none can match the efficiency on a cost per
student basis of a bus system. This point is always one of
we foremost in prescribing what systems we will have in the
foto'e and why.
Further question was raised about the late night operation
0 tte bus service. Presently, buses suspend operation around
a-m., and Technic wondered what could be done to aid
students returning from late night activities on Central
a"ipus. Vice-President Pierpont reminded us that at one
lm* the bus system did remain active considerably later,
t lack of student usage proved the additional operational
hours to be too expensive. As a result the operation time
was cut. He also told us that if sufficient demand could be
shown, it is conceivable that the service could be reinstated.
Another major area of interest that was discussed during
the course of the interview concerned parking facilities on
North Campus. Considering the large numbers of students
that might need to drive to North Campus, I asked Vice-
President Pierpont about these facilities. He assured us
that the University views this as a definite problem, one
which would have to be met regardless of cost. At present
there are plans to construct additional parking facilities
on North Campus for both students and staff. A problem
arises in that these facilities may not be immediately
adjacent to the Engineering buildings and students may still
have to board the buses for a short ride across North Campus
or else walk to their destination.
Traffic congestion enroute to North Campus, with the
additional influx of students to the area, is potentially
another problem. Technic was informed by Vice-President
Pierpont that studies by the city of Ann Arbor as well as
the University have been carried out. They have determined
that Fuller Road between the Medical Center and North
Campus will need to be widened to a full four lanes. The
problem is that neither the University or the City have the
funds available to finance construction of the new road.
As a result the headache rests with either the County or the
State. Neither of these two have shown a willingness to carry
out this construction at the present.
Finally the question of private businesses being drawn
to the North Campus area was discussed. At the present,
restaurants, bars, etc., are at a premium to the residents of
North Campus. Vice-President Pierpont was asked about
the University providing land either for sale or lease to
private business to fill these needs. He pointed out to us
that the recreational sports facilities could be foreseen to
be provided by the University. These included such
facilities as tennis courts, archery ranges, and basketball
courts. Although nothing has been definitely planned
beyond the completion of the new North Campus Gymna-
sium. Vice-President Pierpont did make it quite clear that
space for private enterprise would not be provided. If there
is the need for this sort of enterprise it would be up to the
individual private businesses to acquire land by their own
means, probably along the Plymouth Road area.

The seed catalogs have started to arrive. It's time to
think and plan. What worked out well last year? Are there
any new hybrids worth considering for next year? Before
you know it, Easter will be here. Now as I remember it, the
peas should be planted by Good Friday. You know, what
is true of gardening is also true of college planning. Unless
the faculty and administration of the College of Engineering
carefully survey the coming years and the genuine needs,
what we put into the ground today may not bear real
fruit 25 or 50 years from now. In 25 years the children
of the class of 1976 will be coming out of college. What
should that school be like?
This question is the one that should occupy us intimately
as plans to add new strength and resources to the College
are formulated. Part of these plans, and only a part, is the
Capital Campaign. It has been successful in harvesting a lot
of money. At the last count it was 11.5 million. That's
not enough to move the College, but it is enough to make
people think. The climate has changed suddenly and a move
for the College is no longer idle talk. Some dream about
putting up buildings. Some think about the destiny of the
College. Until now, the dreamers have been in the driver's
seat. Personally, I think that there are times when dreams
can be important. Is there not a line from Shaw that goes
something like, "... to dream what others dare not dream
and ask, 'Why not?'"? But some dreams are made of lesser
stuff. They are the wishful fantasies of those who lack the
imagination to make constructive steps when hemmed-in
by reality. Reality will rule in the end, so it is necessary for
us, as engineers and informed human beings, to examine
closely the situation and how it applies to us.
Reality is occasionally difficult to discern, and all too
often difficult to accept. In 1955, reality for the College
was a continuation of the post-war enrollment growth
with its veterans and, subsequently, their children. Suburbia
was also part of the times. Thus, the College looked to the
open fields that became North Campus for the place where
future expansion should take place. Wind tunnels, automo-
tive laboratories, and atomic reactors were placed there
initially. This was prudent because the facilities were large.
Moreover, each was occasionally noisy, and possibly poten-
tially dangerous in a densely populated area such as the
Central Campus. It was accepted practice to put such
facilities in remote areas, and those who enjoyed working
in them accepted the inconvenience of sometimes being
isolated from the mainstream of activity on the Central
Campus. The engineering buildings were augmented halting-
ly by the two-stage construction of the G.G. Brown
laboratory. In those days it seemed probable that the College
would grow to such proportions that a move to the North
Campus was inevitable.
How times have changed! They may change again, but
today it is widely held that the era of college expansions
and should be, over. What does this mean? It means that the
old solutions should be examined to determine their men
in the world that has taken distinct shape since 19&amp;
Since that time our nation has re-examined its position
vis-a-vis China. Perhaps a close look at the future of t«
College, with all of its facets and ramifications, would not
be a useless luxury.

ssessment, but they may raise some topics which could
irove useful in the present times. Briefly, the stated
eeds for the move to the North Campus are:
1. the need for more space in general,
2. the need for more laboratory space in particular,
nd
3. the need to re-unite the College, which is current-
ly divided between the two campuses.
.et me address these points and attempt to show that
hese needs are closer to wishes. Perhaps we have other
*eds, such as new programs, that are being diluted by our
inoccupation with those listed above.
HEW IS BETTER
The need for more space should be demonstrated in view
if the multitude of projections about the declining college
wpulation. Today's babies will be part of the class of
1995. The number of these infants is about 30% less than
the baby population that resulted in today's college students.
Hie implication is clear that, unless there is a drastic change
in age, sex, and race profile of our students, college
anrollments will decline, or, at best, remain relatively
static over the next generation. Currently, the College has
considerable space on the Central Campus. Some of it is not
utilized in a cost-effective way.
"Togetherness" will not affect only the students. The
faculty will reap its share of benefits. Until now, there
certainly haven't been many pluses for those who are
assigned teach ing functions on the North Campus. There has
been too little apparent, converted planning of the working
schedule of these individuals. They have their share of
classes in the middle of the morning with the attendant
parking problems, and they always show up on the Central
Campus for those meetings on Tuesday at 11:00, an hour
that makes it impossible for them to spend an uninterrupted
day in their laboratories. (It may not be too late to follow
the lead of the IM group and install an electric gate on the
fool of the Church Street structure and issue "keys" only
to faculty who have North Campus and Central Campus
teaching responsibilities.)
If in 10 or more years most of the engineering faculty
"ids itself billeted in their new facilities, the density
of faculty who return to the Central Campus will be
'ittle different than today. Whereas now a few of the
'acuity oscillate back and forth, later many will be going
lo University meetings, lectures, and engineering library,
ar&gt;d lunch on a daily basis. Has the physical separation of a
relatively small part of the Engineering College been
oversold as an issue in the present campaign? When one
considers the alternatives, the answer is a qualified yes.
THE POINT OF NO RETURN
Such thoughts about the validity of the purposes for the
search for new quarters are nearly pointless today. The
College appears to be committed to moving to North
Campus. Part of the commitment is due to the thrust of
tne Capital Campaign. Part of the commitment is due to
l"e Philosophy of the Bump Campaign. The former has
madean issue of the hapless conditions in which we present-
V struggle. Honorable parties have seen our apparent
pl'9ht and have pledged monies to rescue us. If it is decided
to "go to China" and admit that the purposes of the
College can be served honestly and better by a course other
than moving to North Campus, a rationale must be provided.
Otherwise a host of people who have worked vigorously,
dedicatedly, and effectively will be left at Dunkirk. They
must be rescued. They can be with honesty and integrity,
but it will take some doing on the part of many. It will be
hard at times, but I think that we have enough domes for
the job. We might even find honor in our accomplishment.
The Bump campaign is exemplified by the move of Art
Architecture to the North Campus. Now the Math Depart-
ment can move the building, just as soon as someone finds
the money to renovate it. At present, the money is
unavailable. The seers of the University have put the stamp
of PSYCH on East Engineering Building. So as soon as
Chem-E and Met-E move into the new "Dow Building,"
the Psychology department will "bump" into new quarters.
It seems the die is cast, in this regard, so that any
hesitation on the part of the College to vacate East
Engineering and rush to North Campus would cause
embarrassment within the University. Color us blushing
pink.
Yes, the obstacles to a reassessment are many and they
are great. Consider the 5.5 million that have been donated
for a specific building. There are strong forces to put the
building on North Campus. If one thought that Central
Campus was a more appropriate place for it, would the
money still be donated? Has anyone asked that question?
Should we ask that question?
DON Q AND THE GOOD-OLD-DAYS SYNDROME
Despite the obstacles just mentioned, let's dream the
impossible dream, and ask, "Why not?" This means that the
merits of the alternate plans would have to be examined.
People who take their engineering seriously do that all of
the time. If there is limited need to expand to North
Campus and accept some disadvantages, are there any clear
advantages for the College to remain where it is? Let me
offer the following brief items as being genuine advantages.
I'll let you pare, modify, and extend the list according to
your own experience.
1. A centralized University is efficient.
2. A centralized University is educationally superior
to a scattered one.
If the College were to remain on Central Campus the size
of the bus system would not have to increase. That would
entail short and long-term savings of substantial amounts.
The cost of each bus that must be purchased, or replaced,
would be a significant portion of any parcel of land that the
University would have to buy as part of a Central Campus
consolidation program. Such land would not need any
diesel fuel either, especially at tomorrow's prices. Besides
the elimination from the budget of items that serve no
direct educational function, such as the snow-removal
charges for the walkways (?) on North campus, many
redundant facilities need not be constructed. Here, the
proposed "North Campus Mall" is not the issue. The
physical isolation of classrooms and lecture halls on North
Campus creates resources that are not easily accessible to
the entire University community. In times of changing
needs and demands, University-wide flexibility is necessary.
1976

necessary, is sometimes administratively difficult, but
possible. If the buildings are two miles apart, the admini-
strative difficulty ceases. It's simply impossible. But this
may be one of the luxuries that a non-centralized University
can afford. Or can it?
The cost of refurbishing East and West Engineering to
enhance their usefulness would undoubtedly be less expen-
sive than building new structures, the long-term durability
of which would have to be tested. For the college, investing
in the present location might make mortar-money available
for many good purposes. Also the interest money on
$1-10 million is a nice bundle that could be used for
scholarships, rotating faculty and staff endowments, our
multi-media center, etc., ect. These are the building blocks
of a college with vitality.
One item that should be studied, in view of the climate
in which we live, is the relative cost of heating buildings
on the Central and North Campuses. The University boasts
of the efficiency of its electrical generating plant. Not only
does electrical power result, but the waste heat is used to
warm our buildings. Is this heating system capable of some
small additional load with the promise of a continual saving
on the energy bill? About five years ago, before the step-
jump in fuel prices, the University's annual heating bill was
in the millions of dollars. I wondered aloud to the admini-
stration at that time about the savings that would result from
"dialing down." Now the situation has a new dimension.
People who should know the facts have warned that an
energy crisis would result in shutting down buildings on
North Campus. Even without an energy crisis, the construc-
tion of new buildings on the Central Campus could yield
enough revenue from the heating savings to keep our
libraries from having to beg for money to buy journals and
periodicals.
Any discussion about the financial aspects of the
alternatives to the move to North Campus must face up
to the issue of the effective use of the buildings there now.
No one person can presume to have all the answers for that
complex problem. But let me offer one possibility. (No, I
don't intend to trade LS&amp;A all of North Campus for Angell
Hall).
We could make North Campus our center for graduate
engineering education. Of course, the undergraduate courses
in automotive engines would still have to be held out there,
and other limited exceptions would have to be recognized.
But at the present time we have classrooms, office space, and
laboratories that could be combined effectively into such a
graduate center. All graduate classes might be scheduled for
the afternoon. This would facilitate participation by
engineers working in the Ann Arbor area. Innovative
scheduling of mathematics classes, as well as some other
graduate electives, would keep the wear-and-tear on the
students at a minimum. There would be fewer students
inconvenienced. The transportation and parking hassle
would be kept down too. Are there other advantages? Why
don't you, the reader, think about them?
While the matter of the financial advantages for limiting
the University expansion to North Campus can be calculated
as being high or low, plus or minus, the educational
advantages to keeping our students on Central Campus may
be more controversial.
In order to provide a truly broad education for engin-
eering students, the College should give them, to the
maximum possible extent, the opportunity for intercourse
between people. This would mean a great variety of people
and their ideas. They could be lawyers, psychologists,
linguists, architects, dentists, librarians, liberals, radicals,'
racists, whites, blacks, Arabs, Jews, and all those in between.
A real experience. To me this means that the "suburbia"
concept or satellite campuses should not be fostered need-
lessly in a university. Sometimes it may be necessary to
locate a new school in a remote locale. Schools and centers
of research are the agents of demography, or the result of it
as exemplified by Akademgorodok at Novosibirsk, or the
campus at Santa Barbara. In our case I am inclined to keep
the College of Engineering within the University, in
accordance with definition of the term college. Our future
students should go to The University of Michigan, not
North Campus Tech.
Besides the social stimuli and a vibrant exchange of ideas
facilitated by it, the Central Campus offers a range of in-
tellectual activity that is exciting. It may not be the
ambition of many students to earn the title of Proteus, which
Steinmetz's peers granted him because of his great scope,
but our students' interests also transcend their technical
subjects. The ability for them to exercise a free choice of
electives will be seriously curtailed by the need to trek in
from their North Campus surroundings. Perhaps few of
our graduates will revolutionize A.C. machinery as Steinmetz
did, but all will realize the advantages of a college life that
offers broad ideas and varied opportunities.
Questions about "space" usually evoke a comment about
"distribution." We need some large lecture halls. We need
larger classrooms. But why? And what merit does this have
as an argument for the move to North Campus? Are there
spaces in East and West Engineering that could be converted
economically into one or two large lecture rooms? East
Engineering might provide the space for a needed amphi
theatre if the foundry could be moved to more modest
quarters that befit its utilization in the present scheme of
things. Perhaps the foundry cannot be spared, but then
what is the real use for the 300-seat lecture room that is
being planned for the North Campus?
The subject of classroom size has many ramifications.
Do students want large and impersonal classes? Do they want
to be "talked at" instead of taught? The answer is
evident. The matter of how classes are taught in the
future and student/teacher ratios should not be a subject
solely for union bargaining. These are topics that are every
bit as important as 100 ft? offices. The attitude of faculty
concerning the presentation of classes for groups smaller
than 8 students is public. Until now, few have expressed
surprise or indignation at classes of 35, or 100. The matter of
large classes is an issue that should be discussed prior to
planning the classrooms for any new facilities, provided
they are, in fact, needed.
There is a second inference in the increase in classroom
area for the buildings that are currently planned to replace
East and- West Engineering. A 30% increase in size will have

Michigan Technic


by Angelo Muzzin
The anticipated move to North Campus has been
enveloped in a cloud of controversy. The pro's and con's
of the move are still being debated. The Technic in an
effort to define the feelings of the faculty of the college
of Engineering, conducted a survey in the early part of
February on the subject of the North Campus move.
Questionnaires were sent to approximately one fifth of the
faculty. The sample was chosen at random with all of the
departments represented. Of the surveys sent out, forty one
percent were returned to our office.
The survey was enlightening with respect to the questions
we asked and also for the numerous additional comments we
received. A sample of the comments will be given after each
question. Please note if the percentages of a question do not
equal 100%, the balance is due to non-response. The first
question
Yes No What are the advantages ot the move to North
Campus?
45% 11% 1) to attract more and/or better students
52% 15% 2) need for more lab space
44% _§% 3) to attract more and/or better faculty
Jl% 26% 4) availability of funded research increased
41% 18% 5) need to keep pace with new technology 6) other reasons (please list)
It can be seen that need for more lab space is shared by
the majority of the faculty, and the availability of funded
research does not depend much on the move in their view.
A look at some of the comments forwarded by the faculty
introduces some additional advantages. One person writes,
"Advantage: Cutout the need for two offices which is very
inconvenient. In which office do you keep books, equipment,
etc.? They are 'always' in the 'wrong' one", another
Points out, "The planned Media Center will be a big
advantage. No room for it in present buildings.". Many of
'he faculty indicated that instruction would be more
efficient in the new buildings. "Eliminate Commuting and
Separation of Office and Lab.", this comment recurred
!• Another person points out, "Old buildings require
maintenance". As a final comment, one person
'epiied on the subject of the move"(the move will) Complete
an irreversible process. To escape parasitic creeps that infest
Central Campus."
7)16 second question is:
es No What are the disadvantages of the move to
North Campus?
S£* _4% 1} isolation from Central Campus
S0» 32% 2) inefficient transportation
—•*&gt; 30% 3) inappropriate expense or funding
-*?° 21% 4) inappropriate energy usage or demand
— — 5) other reasons (please list)
"he results above indicate that most view isolation from
^Pus as the major liability of the move to North Campus.
This is followed by concern of the transportation system.
In addition to the above the following comments point
out further disadvantages:
"Lack of facilities like stores, restaurants, bars, etc. Even a
good 'Union' would not replace So. U or State St. type
areas."
"The faculty offices are ridiculously small"
"Isolation from Central Campus will, I think, be purely
temporary. The student body and the University are large
enough to require several, rather than a single, central
focus."
"Don't like State of Michigan restrictions on architecture."
"Isolation from the General Library and the UGLI."
"I interact with many Math, faculty and use Math, and
Physics-Astronomy libraries often. I will miss these and
find them difficult to go to."
"Super-Austere (cheap) architectural features likely to be
forced on us, cramped offices, etc."
The faculty is acutely aware of the problems with access
to the library system. This concern is generally shared by
most students in the college. As seen from the survey
questions the aspect of energy usage or of funding are not
major disadvantages.
The third Question is:
Yes No For the engineering student what advantages
are inherent in the move to North Campus?
48% 19% 1) an improved interface between academics
and present technology.
67% n_% 2) more lab space
52% 11% 3) improved engineering climate
4) other reasons (please list)
Again lab space is a positive factor in the move to North
Campus. The majority of the faculty felt that the engin-
eering climate would improve. Item 4 again provided a good
deal of comment. Some of the more representative remarks
are as follows:
"Improved contact with faculty regarding laboratory re-
search"
"Old buildings-inadequate class rooms, inadequate labs,
costly maintenance"
(Re: labs) "There will actually be less space."
In regards to faculty support of the move to North
Campus, the majority of the staff surveyed showed an
active involvement. This involvement was discerned by
the willingness to contribute to the Campaign Fund.
The followingquestion shows the results;
Yes No
63% 33% Have you or will you contribute to the
North Campus fund?
A final part of the survey asked for additional comments,
and our faculty, true to form, was more than willing to
give them. Some of the more outstanding comments
(perhaps tongue in cheek) are;

new frontiers."
"The move to North Campus is analagous to the Vietnam
War in showing the unwillingness of decision makers to
admit they are wrong."
"Present facilities are outmoded, ideal solution, in my
opinion, would be to renovate and replace existing buildings
(EE and WE) with classrooms and labs suited for present
day needs."
"There are disadvantages to the student also in making it
harder to take non-engin. courses (except for Art, Arch, &amp;
Music), and in isolating them from the non-engin type of
students and their thoughts and attitudes. The enqin.
students have less chance of a broad education although
their specialized work will be enhanced."
"When you're seven months pregnant, why fight it?
Just make the best of it. Let's generate some enthusiasm
for doing what we know must be done."
As a final bit of information the sample had offices as
indicated by this final question.

an effect on the quality of future graduating classes. If we
are planning on expanding our share of a shrinking student
population, we shall do so by non-traditional means. It seems
incongruous to want ever-larger freshman classes, even with
a hopeful increase in the admissions of capable minorities,
without recognizing that the standards of our school will
be eroded. If we want this to happen we should discuss
and plan it. We shouldn't let the situation come upon us
through our own negligence.
DRY LABS
One of the recurring themes about the Capital Campaign
is the need for new laboratories. The plea has a hollow
ring to me. Oh, not that laboratories are unimportant in my
view. I think that a student's ability in a laboratory is a
distinct indication of the degree to which the subject has
been mastered. Laboratories are very important. But I know
what value is placed upon laboratory experience by a host
of university personnel. Questions like cost/student/hour/
square foot/BTu are sure to arise. Laboratories are expen-
sive to operate. They get a lot of lip-service. A popular
view of the importance of faculty effort in laboratories
has been recently documented by the issuance of the faculty-
effort scorecard. It has been decided that a faculty member
should receive one point for each hour of lecture, but only
2/3 of a point for each hour of laboratory effort. The few
faculty members who actively prepare laboratory sessions
know that their time in the lab is no "free ride."
THE COLLEGE DIVIDED
It has been said that when a questionnaire was circulated
concurrently with the search for our present dean, a
large majority of the responding faculty members expressed
a belief that the North Campus was a major issue fn the
College's future. This seems to be non-controversial even
today. We now have had 20 years of inconvenience that has
resulted from the slow transplanting of teaching facilities
from the Central to North Campus. Some of this inconven-
ience is due to the distance between the two locations.
Buses and cars became a necessary part of getting to class.
Half-hour time differentials in the starting times permitted
punctuality, if one hurried, to class. This may change if the
College is centralized on the North Campus. Then only the
students who take a variety of mathematics, physics,
chemistry, and LS&amp;A electives will have to be bused.
without time differentials. There may be a few others, too.
not all of the Departments are scheduled to move in the
first major exodus. Some, like Naval Architecture, will
wait for a private or governmental benefactor who will give
them the 0.5x-million dollars to build facilities that are more
extensive than those at present. Until this money is
available, they too will have to commute. So the move to
North Campus will not alleviate the transportation problem.
It will only alter the nature of the users. Now a relatively'
small group travels to and fro; later nearly all will, even
if only to go to the library.
Does not the balance of assets and liabilities for the
North Campus starkly indicate that a reassessment is
reasonable, even now? Think about it.
VOX POPULI
The clouds of change have gathered quickly. For years,
things concerning a move for the College were talked about
abstractly, almost like the weather. Now building plans are
being drawn in earnest. It certainly is not too early for us to
ponder our catalogs. Easter, a time for revitalization and
hope for some, is just around the corner. What kind of re-
sults do we want from our toil? Where should our new
facilities be located? What should they contain? What in-
tangible things must be planned?
The future of the College will affect you even though
you may graduate shortly. You will be part of the Alumni
You will be part of a significant source of the College's
financial support in the future. So, if you have an opinion
about college development, give it now; today it is more
valuable than $100 in 1999. Student recommendations
have an avenue for consideration and positive action in this
College. There are many media including the Council and the
printed word. There is also Professor Weeks' committee that
is dedicated to making our exile less than cruel and unusual
punishment. Given enough ammunition they may even
decide to quit Elba and return to the mainland. After all,
we want another 100 years of glory. Your efforts may even
make it legitimate for the reactionaries to sing their anthem,
"How ya gonna keep 'em down on the farm after theyve
seen Pariel"
The effort is worth it, because the fruits of your labors
will be a College that the class of 1999 can inherit with
satisfaction and profit.

A History of North Campus
by Ray Barry
In keeping with the theme of this issue I am departing
from the usual format of "50 and 25 Years Ago". In it's
place I have substituted the following pictorial history of
North Campus.
North Campus was born in the late 40's as an idea. The
idea began to take shape when the University purchased
the original 300 acre plot and appropriately named it "North
Campus". The rationale behind the acquisition was that
room for expansion was needed, more room than was
available on Central Campus. From the start it was envi-
sioned as a technology center. The times were such that a
technology scare existed; that is, the U.S. had a shortage
of technically trained personnel. This fact combined with a
fear of falling behind the Communists, spurred action to
relieve the situation. A technology center on North Campus
was one step taken under these premisses. Through
subsequent acquisitions. North Campus grew to over 1000
acres.
Thefirst building to go up was Cooley Lab. (shown under
construction below). The Mortimer E. Cooley Memorial
continued
March 1976

Above: This shows North Campus circa 1969. Notice the
buildings not present are Art &amp; Architecture, Engineering
iA, and the Computing Center.
Above Top: This is an older version of North Campus,
about 1963. Note that the Music School is under construc-
tion, G.G. Brown (known then as Fluids) is in a miniature
form and Chrysler Center, the Commons, and Space Re-
search have not begun construction.
Right Top: This is the Chrysler Center for Continuing
Education created for the continued education of the
graduate engineer.
Right Middle: This is North Campus about 1965. The Music
School has not been landscaped yet. The Commons is under
construction. Notice that the additions to G.G. Brown are
under construction.
Right: The latest completed structure is shown here,
Engineering 1A. This building is attached to G.G. Brown and
was completed just last year.

Laboratory was established in 1951, the building was
finished in 1953. Phoenix Memorial Laboratory was the
next lab. to appear. It was a result of the Phoenix Memorial
Project which was created in 1950. The lab was finished
iround 1955. Phoenix is seen under construction to the
also shown is the library annex (under construction).
he Auto Lab. and the Aerospace Building followed. The
lab. had previously been in a shack next to the West
ering Annex. Both the Auto Lab. and the Aero
ling were dedicated in October 1957. The Ford
ear Reactor was also added in 1957. It was the first
Dr not in a large fenced-in area and the most powerful
i any campus at one Megawatt.
The Fluids Lab. was built in 1958. In case you've never
heard of the Fluids Lab., there have been several subsequent
additions to it, and it is now known as G.G. Brown.
The Chrysler Center for Continuing Education was
finished in 1968, the Computing Center in 1971, and
Engineering 1A in 1975. The Institute of Science and
Technology was created as a U-M research group in 1957
and the building was completed in 1963. The Music
School was completed in 1964, the Commons was started
about 1965, and Art &amp; Architecture was finished in 1974.

General Wahn Santchez DeNose Technic, distant cousin
of Shakey, shown above, is now in the Democratic
Monarchy of San Saliva, Chile's next door neighbor. Wahn
is on assignment for MSA. He has become the dynamic
leader of the Salivic Unifaction Revolutionary Party
(SLURP) and is working to overthrow the present CIA
established dictatorship.
"I became a revolutionary because I needed a vacation
from working on the Technic. Besides, they don't prose
cute child molesters down here." said Wahn. "Why do I
read Technic?" he continued, "I particularly enjoy the
"Forum" section, and the centerfolds are quite revealing,
but mainly it makes me look intelligent."
When will Wahn be returning to the Technic?
think I'll stick around for the next three revolutions."
We expect him back next week. Wahn is asking everyone
to donate their spare widgets to the cause.

of creating
a better environment
If you are concerned, put your capability and professionalism to work with the
Corps of Engineers. Today we are facing many challenges to better the quality
of life. One important area is to balance the development of our water resources
with the preservation and enhancement of our natural environment.
A career with the Corps of Engineers offers outstanding professional opportu-
nity and personal satisfaction to engineers working to help solve critical environ-
mental problems.
We need engineers—professionals who have a creative approach, who want
to work with economists, planners, landscape architects, biologists—to better
the quality of life.
You'll find challenging opportunities involving planning, design, and construc-
tion for water resources development and navigation projects, development of
non-structural solutions to flood control projects, and hydro electric power
projects. You'll find these also on a wide spectrum of facility systems, including
industrial plants, missile and space exploration launch and control facilities,
medical centers, communications, and family housing.
The Corps of Engineers is the world's largest engineering/construction orga-
nization. We apply all the techniques of modern technology to the improvement
of our construction capability—system analysis, computer technology, advanced
materials research and more.

engineers who are
revolutionary
at heart.
By revolutionary, we mean we're looking for engineers who
thrive on change.
There's a revolution going on, a technical revolution.
Every day, there are new changes. Changes in components
Products. Systems. Materials. Changes in processes. And even
in whole technologies.
General Electric needs engineers who like change.
Who can adapt easily to change. And who can use change
creatively.
Generally, we've found that the engineers who are
most responsive to change are those well grounded in
the fundamentals. Who have a broad view that helps
them evaluate and make use of changing technologies
Who are flexible. And who haven't become too special
ized yet. /
Are you that kind of engineer? General Electric is
that kind of company.
GE is constantly evaluating, developing, testing
and applying new technologies. That's one of the
reasons we're into so many
ness areas. And coming up
many new products.

Now problems that once took hours
can be solved in seconds.
Some of the toughest, most com-
plicated mathematical problems
you can possibly encounter are
being solved in seconds on a pro-
grammable calculator you can
hold in your hand and carry on
your hip. It's the way complex
problems are getting solved now
-and it'll be the way for years.
That's why you're ready for a
programmable right now. Be-
cause you're on the threshold of
a career. You need every edge
you can get. And, a program-
mable is indeed a big edge,
whether you stay on campus for
a couple of years, or soon leave
to join industry. Because it does
more for you than just get an-
swers. It lets you respond to the
pressures of making accurate
decisions faster. You can cope
with masses of data. Optimize
mathematical models. Perform
statistical reductions. Develop
broad "what if" matrices. Ana-
lyze trends. The list could go on.
Is programming difficult? Abso-
lutely not. It's really no more
than a calculator's capability
to: Learn what you teach it.
Remember what you want it to.
And automatically execute the
series of steps, or respond to the
decisions you put into it.
Most of the important deci-
sion-making functions found on
computers are available on
TI programmables: Looping.
Branching. Flags. Sub-routines.
Yet there's no special language
to learn. TI's full Algebraic
Operating System (AOS) is nat-
ural-left-to-right. It's easy to
use, and so flexible that you can
aPply it to your own personal
Problem solving techniques.
SR-52. Card programmable
Offers twice the capability of
the only other programmable in
&gt;ts class - at half the price.!
Records up to 224 keystrokes
on reusable magnetic cards. Has
20 user memories. Preprogram-
med card libraries are available
which can be integrated into
your problem solving routines.
Repeat a program as often as
needed. Change values. Explore
"what if" possibilities.
Enter calculations exactly as
stated —left-to-right. Nine levels
of parentheses, plus an 11-
register stack handle problems
with up to 10 pending operations.
Literally teach the SR-52 your
own calculating methods. Key in
your program directly from the
keyboard. If you wish, record
your program on a magnetic card
to use again and again. Used
manually, the SR-52 is one of the
most powerful handheld, slide
rule calculators available today.
A Basic Library of 16 programs
comes with the SR-52. Optional
SR-50A and
SR-51A offer
exceptional
slide rule
math power
and value.
SR-50A $79.95* Full func-
tion, on-the-go portable
featuring algebraic entry
with sum-of-products capa-
bility. Performs trig and
hyperbolic functions, logs,
e to the x power, xth root of
y and much more.
SR-51A $119.95* Per-
forms all functions found
on the SR-50A, and more:
Mean, variance and stan-
dard deviation. Permuta-
tion. Slope and intercept.
Trend line analysis and lin-
ear regression. Has 20 pre-
programmed conversions
and inverses.
libraries containing extensive
programs in engineering, math,
statistics, finance, etc., are also
available.
SR-56. Super slide rule
with key programming.
$179.95*
The ideal student program-
mable. No programmable is
easier to master. Use up to 100
programming steps with 10 user
memories, nine levels of paren-
theses, plus an eight-register
stack that handles up to seven
pending operations. Add, sub-
tract, multiply, divide within a
register without affecting the
calculation in progress.
Two unique features. A special
test register permits comparison
with the displayed value at any
point in a calculation —without
interfering with what's in pro-
gress. A pause key keeps the
display visible for Vz-second dur-
ing program execution. It also
lets you go through a problem
one step at a time.
Supply the input data, then
execute the solution of a stored
sequence automatically. Get an-
swers without the tedium of
remembering and pressing keys
repetitively. Three uncondition-
al branches and six conditional
branches —which includes four
levels of subroutine and two loop
control instructions — give the
SR-56 great decision making
power.
An Applications Book contain-
ing over 50 programs in math,
electrical engineering, finance,
statistics, surveying, etc. comes
with an SR-56.

If we don't wash our wastewater
he may have to drink it.
Every day, a million people
living in a typical American city
generate about half a million
tons of wastewater.
Sewage systems in many cities
cannot cope with these amounts.
So wastewater is not cleaned thor-
oughly before it's discharged
into rivers and lakes, and con-
tributes to their pollution. The
same rivers and lakes we rely
upon for our drinking water.
Union Carbide has developed
a wastewater treatment system
called UNOX. It cleans the dirty
water of towns and cities faster,
cheaper, and uses less energy
and space than any system de-
vised before it.
The Unox System uses high-
purity oxygen instead of air.The
oxygen is forced into a series of
closed treatment tanks where it
increases the efficiency of the
microorganisms that feed on pol-
lution and improvewaterquality.
Nearly 100 cities are now us-
ing or installing the Unox Sys-
tem. As the population of Amer-
ica grows, so does our need for
clean water. And if we don't
clean our dirty water, no one is
going to do it for us.

Last month we dealt with a single theme. North Campus.
This month we have a wide variety of material. Starting
off, we have a short piece by Paul Heinmiller, President of
Honor Council. Paul has a few things that he is concerned
about regarding the Honor Code so we asked him to write
about it for us. As President of Honor Council, Paul has
some pertinent comments to make.

admit that he is indeed prolific.

If you think the Honor Code is working now, you're
fooling yourself. What have YOU done to help the Honor
system lately? Remember that guy next to you who was
using a crib sheet in your last closed notes bluebook?
What did you do? If you are like most students, you
probably thought that someone else, maybe the guy on the
other side of him, would turn him in. Well, that's where
you're fooling yourself. The Honor System is based on
you, not someone else, telling the Honor Council or your
professor about that student next to you.
Most students don't understand the Honor System and
don't know that confidentiality is strictly kept. The accused
student's name isn't printed for public scorn and witnesses
aren't put on public display for praise. You might ask,
"Why should / turn in the next guy to me? What do I get
out of it?" True, you don't receive a Medal of Honor for
helping the Honor Council, but when was the last time you
received a material gain for paying your taxes? When you
live within a system, subject to the benefits of that system,
you must live by the system. The Honor System is based
on students, not Honor Council, not professors, and not
TV cameras in air vents. Students must be responsible
for "taking care of their own." Living in the Honor
System is very convenient for the honest student and too
convenient for the dishonest student. It is up to the
honest students in the college to look out for the dishonest
ones. While you work hard to memorize that formula
for MM 250, they are making up a cheat sheet to bring to
the exam.
Because most students are uninformed or misinformed,
the Honor Council has developed a plan for increasing the
student awareness of the Honor Code. This article has been
written to let you know what our new plan is and how
you can help. In order to make this plan work we need the
hefp of students, administrators, and faculty. We would
like to increase student awareness of the Honor Code, im-
prove Honor Council investigations, and cut down on un-
necessary cases. Our plan is centered on increased communi-
cation between students, faculty, and Honor Council. The
primary step in the plan is the acquisition of Honor Coun-
cil office space for discussions with students and pro-
fessors.
Increased Student Awareness
Our drive for student awareness is based on better two-
way communication between Honor Council and the rest
of the students. At the present time there is virtually no
communication in this vein and improvement is sorely
needed. Honor Council needs to be more accessible to the
students. Face-to-face discussion with students has no
equal for effective communication. This cannot be accom-
plished without office space. A suggestion-response system
will be available as a back-up to discussions.
Increased input to the Honor Council from students is
needed for more effective operation of the Honor System.
In order for the Honor Council to work with the students
we must be available to answer questions and talk with
interested students. Establishment of an Honor Council
office will allow this necessary communication to take
place.
A suggestion-response system will allow students to
make suggestions and present ideas with an option of
anonymity. Anonymous suggestions should dwindle after
the Council becomes more understood by the students
Development and publicity of the suggestion-response
system will be an improvement over the present situation
although not as much face-to-face discussions.
Short summaries of current cases will be posted on the
Honor Council bulletin board outside 218 WE and printed
in Datum. This will give students a feedback device to
show how the Honor Code works. Summaries will be altered
to insure confidentiality.
Improved Case Investigations
Improving case investigations shortens the time required
for an Honor Code case to be processed. Following a case
hearing, the investigator writes letters to the involved
students and a case report to the President. The Secretary
then writes a recommendation and returns all paperwork
to the President. The President delivers the prepared case
work to the Faculty Committee on Discipline for action.
At the present time this sequence takes 3-5 weeks. Upon
the establishment of an Honor Council office it should
take 1-2 weeks to process a case. This is in the best interests
of all parties involved. An Honor Council office will allow
for a guaranteed confidential meeting room for case in-
vestigations and a location for central record-keeping to
prevent loss of confidential records.
Elimination of Unnecessary Cases
Elimination of unnecessary cases lets the Honor Council
devote time to cases of a more serious nature. Unnecessary
cases are cases which could have been bypassed by a slight
restructuring of the examination or by a discussion of cases
with instructors.
If instructors will alter their examination methods, this
will help to remove unnecessary cases. Removing accent
from take-home exams reduces pressure. Rewriting exams

from the editor's desk
The proverbial mad scientist is no science fiction
antasy. They seem to exist all around us. Perhaps that's
rash statement, sometimes I think not.
I was listening to the news on the radio not too long ago
vhen I heard a most astonishing item. A scientist was being
interviewed. He was predicting the implantation of minia-
:ure computers in human brains to assist memory and
linking. His prediction was targeted for 50 years hence.
To me it sounded like something from Star Trek, one of
those far fetched dreams with no basis in reality.
I wasn't really astonished that anyone considered it
possible, I know as well as anyone else that what we con-
sider impossible today may be the commonplace of to-
morrow. No, I was left open mouthed by the enthusiasm
with which this scientist approached the subject; he was
obviously advocating such a development. Just walk into
the nearest hospital and emerge with an IQ of 200, or what-
ever you please, forecasted this scientific soothsayer. Obtain
effortless learning, remember everything, become a god!
Would you call this man mad? I would. He's a technology
idiot. He must have watched too much of that bionic stuff
on TV. He's like a racehorse with blinders, he can see only
what is in front of his nose and races after it while not
bothering to turn his head and see what is around him.
There are too many people like him, wrapped up in their
own little technical world. They praise technology for
technology's sake. They are so interested in doing something
no one else has done, to have glory heaped upon them-
selves, that they don't accept the responsibility for the
monsters they create in the process. They lose touch with
humanity.
The first thing that came to my mind was a vision of
'954. Implant a chip in the brains of an entire population
and they'll do whatever Big Brother tells them to do. Just
each term places less emphasis on exam files and more on
course content. Retaining answer sheets until all similar
make-up tests are taken lessens the chance of an inadvertent
error by the student. Adequate spacing between students
^creases the possibility of an accidental glance at another
student's paper. It is essential that these methods be im-
plemented by present faculty and impressed upon in-
coming instructors.
A Provision must be made for two-way communication
between faculty and Honor Council. There is no adequate
method at present for ideas to pass from one group to the
otner. Faculty must be made aware of the inherent problems
Wlth the Honor Code and the Council must have input
the machinery for some luney to out-do Hitler. And if you
think there could never be another Hitler you are being
naive. Envision an entire military force wired to kill,
completely without fear or emotion. Imagine an entire
minority group (pick your favorite) wired for automation.
Visualize a madman wired with an IQ here-to-fore unheard
of, running lose to ravage society.
Does that scare you? It does me, but then maybe I've
watched too much Star Trek.
When will man realize there are certain technologies that
are best not developed? There are some things that are not
worth the risk. When will scientists and engineers take the
blinders off? Unfortunately, I think most only care about
those almighty bucks running through their fingers than
what they are doing.
Sure there would be benefits to such technology, but are
they really necessary? Could man even cope with the
benefits? Do these technology idiots really care?
This type of problem in technology is becoming more
prominent. Recombinant DNA is another example. Our
technology has overwhelmed us, in some instances controls
us, and contains the awesome power to destroy us with
the slightest slip-up. It's about time we all started taking a
serious look at it and stop plunging blindly forward.
This is not an anti-technology argument. I fully realize
the human race could no longer exist without it. We need
technology to provide our food, clothing, housing, power,
and yes, comfort. Our survival depends upon technology
but, there are limits. Our efforts should be directed in
worthwhile areas. We need a computer implant for our
brains like we need a hole in our heads.
Beware! Not all of the lunies are in cages, some of them
even carry a Ph.D. at the end of their name.
on problems with testing procedures.
Conclusions
Honor Council needs office space, without it we will
remain as ineffective as we are at present. The entire plan
for a more effective Honor Code is based on increased
communications which are extremely difficult without
office space.
We need you, the student, to help us. This is your
system not just ours. Without student cooperation we
might as well return to proctored exams. If you see a viola-
tion of the Honor Code, call one of us or leave a message
for the Council in the Dean's office. Watch the bulletin
board outside 218 WE for more information.

NUCLEAR PHYSICS AND WEAPONS DESIGN
by Randy Warsaw
Congratulations, you have just enrolled in the Michigan
Technic's Nuclear Physics and Weapons design course.
This course is designed to develop the feel of weapons de-
sign and the problems therein. If completed satisfactorily
and with a nominal five dollar donation to the Michigan
Technic, you will be presented with a certificate that
enables the holder to do government research at the follow-
ing highly thought of institutions to wit: Washtenaw
Community College, Huron High School, and the ever
popular Residential College of the University of Michigan.
This course will cover the difficulties in the construction
of atomic weapons by non government controlled groups.
LESSON 1 (The Basics)
Certain atoms in the Universe have been given the
ability to split into two rather uneven pieces. This process
is called fission (pronounced almost like a drunk would
pronounce fishin). The most important fissionable materials
are certain isotopes of uranium and plutonium. Isotopes
are elements with different nuclear masses and the same
nuclear charge. The two isotopes favored by the nuclear
people are U235 and Pu239 a simplified view of the pro-
cess is that a neutron collides with a nucleus of U235 or
pu239_ 7hjs causes an instability in the nucleus. The new
compound nucleus is one neutron heavy. It is inherently un-
stable. From an energy (binding) point of view, it is easier to
split into two fission fragments with an average of 2.2
neutrons. This split releases energy. No partial neutrons
are allowed to exist; therefore, only combinations of one,
two, and three averaging out to 2.2 exist. The energy
in the process is a hundred thousand times to millions
of times greater than a chemical reaction. It is this energy
that enables reactors and weapons to function. Last year
Technic devoted several issues to peaceful use of the atom;
and now for all you destructive minded folks who wish
to know how to make your favorite city disappear, its
weapon time.
LESSON 2 (Chains, My Baby's Got Me Locked Up In Chains)
A chain reaction may be formed with fissions. The
neutrons released by a fission may trigger another fission if
the circumstances are favorable. This means that one
fission may trigger two and the next generation may
trigger up to four and so on. This looks like it may never
stop, but no chain reaction may last forever. A neutron
may scatter or leak out of the system, a neutron may be
absorbed, or a neutron may run out of fissionable material.
This unfortunately rules out the very popular science
fiction theory that a chain reaction may envelop the
world. The chain will continue if the number of fission
neutrons produced is equal to the number that are
absorbed by the fuel, air (or any other material) or leaked
out of the system. This condition is called critical. The
positioning of the elements in a fission system is called
critical assembly. The mass of material that is bare mini-
mum to achieve criticality is called critical mass. Critical
mass is dependent on the shape of the critical assembly or
the critical geometry. Also important in any critical system
is the concentration of the fissionable material and any
impurities in the system. The impurities in the system
absorb neutrons and therefore make it less likely that a
neutron will be absorbed. Last but not least is the type of
reflector used in the system. A reflector increases the chance
that a neutron will be scattered back into the system and
not be lost to the outside.
The simplest of all geometries to get critical is the
sphere. Next, all impurities need to be removed to pre-
vent absorbtion loss. Both uranium 238 and other Plu-
toniums are neutron absorbers and must be removed.
Separation is difficult due to the fact that all isotopes
of the same element have the same chemical properties.
Separations are difficult and expensive. Work in this area
has been successful with gaseous diffusion and ionic
separation. Gaseous diffusion depends on the different
weights of the molecules diffusing at different rates through
a semipermeable membrane. The uranium is separated in a
flouride compound.
The ionic method is based on the theory that different
weight ions are pulled at different velocities through
magnetic fields. These plants cost millions to build and
operate. The only slightly promising small scale technique
that is possible is centrifuging. This will not separate large
amounts, and only modest purity can be achieved. Ninety
percent purity is needed for a bomb. To make matters
worse, large amounts of electrical power are needed
(therefore, Detroit Edison and the U.S. Government will
know what you're up to). The greater amount of material

material needed for criticality.
SSON 3 (The Doctor Strangelove Effect)
The third lesson in this course is bomb design. In this
;on a twenty kiloton device will be used in the demon-
ition. This device will not be set off until after today's
ture. A twenty kiloton device means the bomb has as
ch explosive force as twenty thousand tons of T.N.T.
b device requires around eight kilograms of plutonium
9 of greater than ninety percent purity. It must be
med into a sphere of six or seven inches across,
lally it must be surrounded by a suitable reflector,
nple, right? Wrong!!!! Plutonium is radioactive. Activity
governed by the halflife of a material. Plutonium has a
flife of 24400 years. Activity equals (number of atoms)
In2)/(halflife).
Activity = (number of plutonium atoms) (In 2)
(7.694 x 10"11) seconds,
lere (7.694 x 10"H) represents the half life in seconds.
:tivity = (9 x 10'13)x (number of plutonium atoms)
i units being disintegrations per second.
The quantity of material to build a bomb is around
)ht kilograms. This represents about 33.5 moles of the
etal. This means that the number of atoms in a bomb is
iual to 2.2x1025. Plugging back into our activity equation
B find that the number of disintegrations per second is
18x10.13. yhis is defined in units of curies with the
suit being 490 curies. A curie is 3.7x10^0 disintegrations
sr second. This is a large amount of radioactivity.
ESSON 4 (The Care And Feeding Of A Baby Bomb)
Large amounts of radioactive material must be handled
i special ways. Plutonium is radioactive and is an alpha
article emitter. An alpha particle is an ionized Helium
ucleus. It has a charge of +2 and a nuclear mass of 4.
Vlpha particles are stopped very rapidly in the light metals.
"his material may be handled easily and safely behind a
ew layers of aluminum. The problem lies with the
nachining of the radioactive material. Small slivers of the
netal are always kicked into the air in any machining
irocess. These slivers, like the original metal, are alpha
emitters. If ingested they are bone seeking and tend to
rradiate the bone marrow. This will cause cancer of the
wne marrow. If inhaled even the smallest amount is
carcinogenic. Lung cancer can result. Plutonium is a
very toxic material. Any machining that is done should be
done in an airtight glovebox with the air in the box finely
filtered. Plutonium is much denser than lead so any notions
°f it being a feather weight material that enter your mind
must be forgotten.
To make matters worse, plutonium must be kept in
small amounts to keep it from going into a critical state.
"* aluminum sheets used to shield the alpha particles
r°m decaying plutonium look like paper to a cannon ball
or the fast fission neutrons accompanying a critical state
or Plutonium. You must make all efforts not to let your
Pfebomb work go critical. If it does you will not have to
Worry about filing your income tax late next year.
Reality calculations are extremely difficult and com-
Pex- Graduate engineers and physicists have trouble with
them.
LESSON 5 (How To Beg, Borrow, Or Steal Plutonium)
Possession of plutonium without a license is a federal
crime. It is illegal to own and very hard to beg or borrow
from any lab. The federal government (N.R.C.) grants
permits if you show competency in the handling of
nuclear materials, if you show safe facilities, and if you
show reason for possession. A valid reason is not that you
hate the town of Pittsburgh. The alternatives left are to
forget about plutonium, break into a U.S. weapons lab
(usually guarded) break into a reprocessing lab (fuel re-
processing labs usually have' tight security also) or steal
a spent fuel shipment and do the processing yourself. It is
the fourth suggestion that the opponents of nuclear power
worried about until they found the reasons why this was
invalid.
Fuel shipments have very low security if any. Fuel is
usually shipped in three metric ton lots to a reprocessing
plant. The spent fuel in a shipping cask represents usually
over one hundred thousand curies (mostly strong gamma
ray emitters). Fuel reprocessing plants have walls three or
more feet thick. Special ventilation systems are needed. All
work is done with mechanical hands. Air ducts in the plant
must follow a non-straight course. All chemicals used to
separate the elements become radioactive. This is a risky
business and not to be entered as a whim. Fuel reprocessing
plants must have items such as large cranes and machinery
to keep the spent fuel cool while it is waiting to be
separated.
LESSON 6 (What A Bomb Looks Like)
A bomb consists of a sphere of pure plutonium with a cyl-
indrical plug removed. The whole sphere (with the plug) is
critical. The sphere is surrounded by an appropriate reflector.
The plug is located away from the sphere in a tube that allows
it to slide into the hole in the sphere. If the plug is moved
into the sphere rapidly enough a power excursion takes
place and the bomb goes supercritical. It becomes an
atomic bomb. There are still problems with the design thus
far. If the plug does not slide in fast enough a meltdown of
the system may occur. The plug must come in at a frightful
velocity. This is done rather in the way a bullet is fired from
a gun. Behind the plug is an explosive charge. When this is
detonated the charge sends the plug into the sphere in a
very short time. How much explosive is needed to send the
plug in at the right velocity? This question depends on the
type of explosive, the length of the tube and the friction
of the sliding plug. The types of materials used in the
casing and the tubes are questions for materials people and
lie well beyond the scope of this article.
Neutron triggering of the bomb is used to ensure that
there are enough initial neutrons to start the chain. Usually
a berilium compound is used to start the chain. It should
be clearly obvious that no highschool or college under-
graduate has the funds or the knowledge to construct a
bomb. Most countries that are into atomic weapons
research employ thousands of scientists, physicists, and
engineers. Funding is incredibly large, the technical pro-
blems are almost insurmountable and the danger is great if
the calculations mentioned in this article are not carried
out checked and rechecked. Quality equipment is also
important, the costs running into the millions.

Take
a lesson
from a tennis pro.
A tennis champion's powerful backhand looks as smooth and
unhurried as a ballerina's graceful bow. What's the secret? Being
in the right position in plenty of time.
"Remember this about the backhand," the pros advise. "Get both feet
around pointing toward the sideline. And always make sure the right foot's
forward, so your body doesn't cramp your swing."
Getting into proper position early is good advice for college seniors, too.
Here's the first step:
When companies interview on your campus, make sure they interview you. When The Timken
Company representative stops by, don't let him go without seeing you.
He'll fill you in on our work (maybe your work) with the aerospace, automotive, construction,
chemical industries. Our openings in production, engineering, sales, marketing, finance,
metallurgy. Our continuing expansion and modernization program. And our strict policy of
promotion from within.
So you won't get caught flat-footed when it's
your turn to make your move.

STEREO ON A.M. RADIO!
by Robert Watson
The advent of stereo P.M. broadcasting was a great
milestone in public radio, and now that several broadcasters
are using matrixed 4 channel techniques, many people have
been wondering if A.M. broadcasting might be upgraded
too. Japan's powerful NHK television network has already
broadcast stereo audio and the logical question is, "When
will stereo come to A.M.?" The answer to this question
is that it already has!
The first experiments in stereo on A.M. were really
simultaneous transmissions of one stereo channel on P.M.
and the other channel on A.M. Obviously, this is not really
what most people had in mind, and when P.M. went stereo
on its own, something else had to be tried. It did not take
the resourceful A.M. engineers more than a few months to
decide that what an A.M. and P.M. station could do, could
be done just as well with two A.M. stations. Several
clever designs were developed to take advantage of this
scheme. One Japanese design is shown in figure 1.
There were several disadvantages to this method but the
most significant disadvantage was that the Federal Communi-
cations Commission (F.C.C.) decided that the system was
illegal. The F.C.C. has established a doctrine of manda-
tory compatibility in regard to commercial broadcasting.
The F.C.C. requires that owners of old equipment be able
to receive signals from new broadcast systems without
significant loss in audio quality. For example, owners of
mono-only P.M. receivers hear essentially the same signal
regardless of whether the transmission is stereo or mono.
In the fall of 1975, at F.C.C. request, the National
Association of Broadcasters (N.A.B.), the Electronics In-
Radio Frequency

dustries Association (E.I.A.) and the Institute of Electrical
and Electronics Engineers (I.E.E.E.) met as the "National
A.M. Stereophonic Radio Committee" in order to formu-
late recommendations of appropriate methods for A.M.
stereo broadcasting. Theirs was not an easy task as we shall
see.

F.M., as broadcast in the U.S., has broad bandwidth
capability which allows the transmission of frequencies
as great as 53kHz (5.3x10^ c.p.s.) as required by the stereo
multiplex system. This is not possible with standard broad-
cast band A.M. because of the restrictions in the way the
channel frequencies are assigned by the F.C.C. The F.M.
channel allocations are in odd multiples of 100kHz i.e.,
88.1MHz, 88.3MHz, 88.5MHz, etc., which produces a net
interchannel spacing (I.C.S.) of 200kHz. A similar spacing of
channels on the A.M. broadcast band would allow only six
channels in the 540kHz-1600kHz spectrum. Prudently, the
F.C.C. established an I.C.S. of 10kHz for the A.M. band.
Then, is A.M. stereo doomed? Not yet! But before we con-
tinue, a brief general discussion of the A.M. signal is in or*
The two audio "sidebands" are symmetrical in fi
quency about the carrier frequency. They are "min
images" of each other. This means that both sideban
carry essentially identical information. The significance
this fact will be discussed later.
The signal bandwidth of an A.M. signal can be calcuiat
by the formula:
B.W.
Wm
n
where B.W. is the bandwidth in Hertz and Wm is i
highest modulating in radians per second. For examf
if a 10kHz tone is the signal transmitted then:
B.W. = [27T(104)1 = 2fJkHz
n
This indicates that an A.M. signal containing au&lt;
components up to 10kHz will produce "sidebands" up
Jl 10kHz from the carrier frequency. Since the F.C
controls channel frequency allocations so that two bra
casters in the same receiving area are separated by at le
20kHz, 10kHz is a realizable upper frequency limit:
A.M. audio fidelity. It should be immediately obvious tf
the method used to produce F.M. stereo, with its 53kl
transmitted frequency response requirement, is not appln
ble to A.M. broadcasting.

Modulated Signal
Note that the A.M. sidebands are "mirror images" of
h other in frequency. This redundancy of the A.M.
lal suggests a possible scheme for stereo A.M. If one of
side bands were removed, the signal still contains the
le audio information, but now it is possible to replace
missing sideband with a new sideband which contains
ferent audio information. If one of the sidebands con-
is the left stereo channel and the other sideband contains
i right stereo channel, all the information required for
reo broadcasting will be contained in the signal. A
ick diagram of a system using this plan is shown in figure
The "independent sideband" (I.S.B.) system shown here
lighly simplified, but it is important to note the relative
"nplexity of the design. The bandpass filters have to be
pensive components if good stereo separation is to be
lintained. However, this system is mono-stereo compati-
. A mono receiver will demodulate the two sidebands
mltaneously to produce the audio sum of left plus right
ich is the mono equivalent.
There are other schemes to produce stereo A.M. which
i either too costly, complex or of poor quality. The
rpose of this paper is not to recount all these methods,
t instead this paper is intended to introduce a revolution-
1 new method of A.M. modulation.
Recent work in a U.S. Naval communications R&amp;D
moratory is responsible for the development of a new kind
signal modulation called "asymmetrical envelope modu-
tion" (A.E.M.). Originally classified, the details of the
stem were officially declassified in late 1973. It was'my
tv good fortune to be working in communications R&amp;D
* the Navy at that time. After some consultation with my
sociates, possible application to stereo A.M. broadcasting
as proposed.
As indicated previously, the standard A.M. signal is fre-
uency "Symmetrical" with "mirror image" sidebands,
ess frequently noted, is the symmetry of the modulation
"envelope" as shown in figure 5.
This symmetry is ignored by the typical A.M. demodula-
tor circuit as can be seen in figure 6.
Note that the detector diode passes only the positive por-
tion of the A.M. "envelope". This indicates that the nega-
tive portion could be completely different and yet the
positive peak detector would be unaffected! If the positive
and negative portion of the envelope were modulated in-
dependently and demodulated independently, A.M. stereo
would be possible! An experimental set-up is diagrammed
in figure 7.
While the test set-up is crude, it is easy to see how the
right and left channels could be transmitted independently
on a single carrier. There is one further requirement how-
ever, in order to fulfill the F.C.C. compatibility criterion.
Note that the typical A.M. demodulator shown in figure 6
detects only the upper half of the envelope. If the upper
half contained only the right stereo channel, mono
listeners would not receive the half of the original signal
which contains the left channel. Figure 8 shows a simple
scheme to overcome this problem:
Using this system, it is easy to see that mono will be
received normally by detectors of the type shown in
figure 6 while stereo is simply retrieved from the composite
signal by the circuit in figure 8.
The real elegance of the system is its relative simplicity.
With a minimum of circuitry it is possible to achieve over
40dB of stereo separation, a feat which could only be
accomplished at great expense with other systems. No
special filtering is required to demodulate the signal.
Almost certainly, one of the major semi-conductor manu-
facturers will produce the demodulator in a single I.C.
package. Of course, initial units would be expensive due to
engineering and production start-up costs, but by April
1st of next year, it is certain that the confusion will have
cleared and that we all can take advantage of stereo on A.M.!!

transmission techniques, are referred to "AM Stereophonic
Broadcasting—An Historical Review" by E.L. Torick in the

he has verified for himself

(Editor's note: This is the text of an address given by
Irving S. Shapiro, Chairman of E.I. du Pont de Nemours
&amp; Company at the National Engineers Week Banquet on
February 17, '76.)
The third American Century is shaping up quite a bit
differently from the second.
Our Second Century began, as you know, with the great
Centennial technological exhibition at Philadelphia, where
the mounting marvels of American ingenuity were put on
display before the world. Though the economy was not in
the best of shape that particular year, the exhibition
exemplified a sense of American boldness and adventure,
a national conviction that we were capable of doing great
and expanded things.
Events bore out that conviction. What followed was a
hundred years in which we completed the settlement of our
nation, built our agricultural and industrial economies, be-
came a world power and a global economic force without
precedent.
Now, it seems to me, we are heading in quite another
direction. The Bicentennial is hallmarked by widespread
forecasts that America has run out of steam, that our rate
of economic growth is going to slow down, that excessive
inflation has set in for the indefinite duration. There are
predictions of investment capital gaps, raw material short-
ages, and of lingering high unemployment. In place of a
sense of boldness and adventure, it is now in vogue to
question our abilities to fulfill present commitments, let
alone make new progress, to raise doubts about the entire
American future.
More pertinent to this meeting, the public's traditional
support for technical innovation and probing the unknown
seems to be in some danger of turning into public demands
for guarantees of security with the known, or even less
than the known.
We have legislation pending in Washington, about which
I'll have some more to say later, which would give the
government the power to ban any substance unless its maker
could provide advance proof of its absolute safety-a
"no harm" guarantee beyond the power of science and
engineering.
We have environmental laws on the books which call for
the installation of more technology than the facts show is
necessary to protect our water and air, a potential major
waste of. investment funds in a time of extremely scarce
capital.
And, in a potential landmark dispute, we have demands
for the prohibition of fluorocarbons because an unproven
theory suggests they might be damaging the ozone layer in
the stratosphere. In this case, there are those who would
rush to judgment with the theory alone, denying industry
even the opportunity to test the concept with actual research.
Undergirding such developments, nodoubt, are the widely
read attacks on technology itself which have been published
in recent years by such social critics as Lewis Mumford and
Charles Reich. In their writings, and in others, it is argued
that technology itself has somehow grown out of human
control and, itself, is a villain, a despoiler of our way of
life, and a generally dehumanizing influence.
I'm here tonight to register one man's vigorous disagree-
ment with such shortsighted views and to record my
positive conviction that the very opposite is generally true.
• In the face of new economic and energy realities, we
are going to need more—and not less—science and engineer-
ing if we are to maintain and advance the standard of
living that our people desire and deserve to have. Our
grown-ups won't step back and our young people won't
settle for a second-class future—nor should they have to.
• In the face of new international realities, we are going
to need more—and not less—science and engineering if the
developed nations and the Third World are to become
partners in pragmatic progress, instead of antagonists

the politics of resentment and the economics of envy."
• And in the face of new social realities, we are going
o need more—and not less—science and engineering if we
re to satisfy clear demands by the American public that
conomic progress be made only if the environment and
he public health are fully safeguarded.
To engineers, these are not philosophical considerations,
nit are hard realities that strike directly where you live.
Riereare those who would purposefully restrict the advance
if technology, and as Samuel C. Florman pointed out in a
ecent book, "if the antitechnological argument is allowed
tostand.theengineerishard pressed to justify his existence."
Mr. Florman—an engineer, businessman and an overseer
at Dartmouth's Thayer School—also observed that "at the
very core of antitechnology, hidden under a veneer of
aesthetic sensibility and ethical concern, lies a yearning
for a totalitarian society" in which an elitist self-appointed
few would decide which products and activities were best
for the rest of us. I'm not going to pursue that concept
here tonight, but I commend it to your consideration.
On a practical level, industry and its engineers confront
a more immediate challenge: The growing idea, reflected
in new legislation and regulations, that risk can somehow
be banned from daily life—and therefore should be banned.
The ultimate answer to such impossible demands, of
course, will lie in no other area but in the quality of your
performance. You must continue to demonstrate, as you
have done so well in the past, that you are, first, sensitive
enough to identify the risks necessarily involved in progress
and, second, are ingenious enough to manage and contain
those risks—so that progress can be achieved with the
highest possible safeguards to public and environmental
safety.
We must continue to develop new products and new
processes, but we must from the beginning anticipate and
satisfy the new public demands for improved assurances
of health and environmental safety. This is not an option.
This is a mandatory requirement.
On the other side of the coin, we—industry and its
engineers—must never compromise our integrity for any
kind of short-range advantage. When a risk cannot be
adequately managed, then we must not hesitate to scrub an
old product or abandon a proposed new product.
We must come forward immediately and completely
to the public when a previously unnoticed hazard is dis-
covered—we can't justify or afford the long-range costs
°f any corporate cover-ups for the sake of short-term
Profitability.
But we will not be able to avoid risk, which permeates
human experience and always will. If we shy from anything
entailing risk—either by our own choice or by legislative
Mandates forced upon us—we will, in fact, be programming
the nation, and our people, for stagnation and retreat.
Anyone who tells us "do it without risk" is really telling us:
Don't do it," and any protestation to the contrary adds
UP to an attempted deception of the public.
While the level of public concern may be new, the
reality of risk is not at all new. Since the founding of the
RePublic, we have made progress only by identifying the
risks inherent in the goals we sought—and then succeeding
to manage and contain those risks with technology in order
to reap the benefits we had perceived. I see nothing to
suggest that this reality has changed, nor has Philip
Handler, head of the National Academy of Sciences.
"It's been extraordinarily easy," Dr. Handler said recent-
ly, "for a few persuasive people with some technical back-
ground to allege that harm is being done—and it's extra-
ordinarily difficult to demonstrate that this isn't so."
Dr. Handler also had some words of advice for anyone
seeking a world freed from all dangers by governmental
mandate. Reasonable people, he said, will take on "moderate
risks for great benefits, small risks for moderate benefits and
no risk if there are no benefits." He added:
"Policymakers must learn that the world is risky and
that the problem isn't whether something is safe, but what
therisksare.andwhether the benefits are worth those risks."
If we could get governmental regulation shifted to such
a rational basis as that, we really would be a step ahead on
the road to sound, reliable progress through the benefits
of excruciatingly careful science and engineering.
To the contrary, however, Federal legislation and regula-
tions that pose new controls over industry contain recurring
demands that I feel must be resisted and moderated:
One such demand—seen in the ozone theory—is that
industry, carrying the burden of negative proof, should
show that a product is absolutely risk free before it can
be launched or continued in commerce.
Another, contained in our environmental laws, is that
the best of all possible technology must be applied to a
particular effort, even though all that technology might
not be needed to accomplish the particular public policy
goal involved.
The answers to those two demands are to be found in
our common sense experience or making unprecedented
progress in a world that is inherently risky.
In the case of the first demand, the answer is that
proving the absence of harm is a human impossibility.
Aristotle told us that centuries ago. The fact that a new
product passes a thousand tests is no assurance that one more
test might not reveal a hazard. Here we must settle for the
objective best that our scientists and engineers can provide:
Assurance that a new product has passed all of the tests
that our best technical brains, experience and integrity
suggest are indicated.
In the case of the second demand, we must respond that
it is not always necessary to do something just because it
might be possible to do it. Here our objective must be to
apply that measure of technology that will accomplish the
desired goal of public or environmental protection, plus a
sensible margin of safety. Anything above that adds up to a
waste of resources—something that we just cannot afford to
do in these times of scarce investment dollars. This could be
achieved if government would confine itself to defining the
desired result and leave it to industry to choose the means
for achieving that result.
The record is replete with specific examples of errors
and disproven doomsday theories in the nation's new,
quixotic search for ironclad protection against risk. We
could discuss such matters as the banning of cyclamates, a
April 1976
17


DDT restrictions, which have been counter-productive in
many food-short areas of the world—water pollution stan-
dards which will require the installation of additional ex-
pensive equipment even after water quality has been
achieved—tougher air pollution standards which would
improve air quality only 2 per cent more than will the
existing standards but which would force the burning of
millions more gallons of gasoline—the "ban now, facts
later" hysteria in the fluorocarbons/ozone controversy—
the environmental resurrection of the Great Lakes, once
written off as dead by activist Cassandras.
Instead, let me focus on one item pending on the
Congressional agenda, legislation to provide new Federal
controls regulating the safety of toxic substances, i.e.,
chemicals. To me, this one subject provides a good case
history illuminating the problems of contemporary relation-
ships between industry and government.
We are, as usual, agreed on the goals: Industry and
government both recognize the need for further public
protection against chemical hazards.
Where we part company, as usual, is on the scope of
the means to be used in achieving that goal. In some ver-
sions of the legislation, industry sincerely sees many of the
handicaps I mentioned as concepts earlier—the implied
demand for zero-risk assurance; the likelihood that more
safeguards than needed will be ordered, thus unnecessarily
escalating the costs and operational problems; the reluc-
tance of the government to set priorities, and instead
make it possible to require that just about everything be
tested; and excessive precautions that would tend to stifle
new inventions, or at least their end-use development, and
hamper other kinds of technological innovation.
Everyone knows that almost any product or substance
can be dangerous if mishandled, but that even the most
overtly dangerous product or substance usually can be
handled with safety if proper safeguards are designed and
observed. This is where the engineering profession, and the
scientists with whom you work, make your sizable contri-
butions to society—and our people have done this extreme-
ly well. Thanks to our engineers and scientists, the overall
safety record of the chemical industry is twice as good as
that of industry in general—despite some highly publicized
cases in which previously unrecognized hazards were
discovered. Our employees, as a group, are safer on the job
than off the job, and mishandled hazards are infrequent
discoveries.
A slew of existing Federal laws already regulate chemi-
cals, including the conditions under which they can be
made and transported; the environmental discharges connec-
ted with their manufacture; and their uses in certain kinds
of consumer products. In addition, a number of the larger
chemical companies have extensive in-house testing facilities,
many other companies contract out a lot of product
testing research and 18 companies now have banded together
to form the Chemical Industry Institute of Toxicology
to test large-volume chemicals.
Nevertheless, the chemical industry does not oppose
a new law providing for a central overview of chemical
dangers. But some of the pending legislation would go far
beyond what is needed to do that job effectively.
Here are a few examples:
Some versions of the toxic substances legislation would
permit the administrator of the Environmental Protection
Agency to move against any substance he thought, and I
quote the words, "may present" an unreasonable risk. Now,
before I joined private industry, I worked in the government
in Washington. I know the basic good intentions of most
administrators. But I also know their sensitivity to publi-
city and political pressures, their tendency to protect them
selves from criticism by covering every possible threat, no
matter how minor. If this particular unqualified grant of
power is made, I can see an administrator of the EPA
ordering expensive and extensive tests on every substance
that has ever been mentioned as a hazard, no matter how
remotely. If some of my industry's basic feedstocks were
included, for example, we could be forced to shut down
until those long tests were completed.
Clearly, in this basic facet of the law, some Congressional
priorities should be set so that the administrator's actions
are directed first to substances actually found to present an
unreasonable risk to people, or to the environment. If such
guidelines are not included, the administrator is going to be
devoting equal attention to all instances of suspected risk
and this adds up to a de facto neglect of the larger hazards.
I also see problems in provisions that would require
extensive and expensive testing of substances in experimen-
tal development or in premarketing testing, both of which
are carried out by highly trained professionals under
stringent laboratory safety procedures. The public is not at
all involved. If we have to run a full range of tests on tenta-
tive discoveries—or on new substances for which we don't
yet see a specific use—a lot of invention and innovation
is going to go by the board, to the public's detriment.
DuPont's "Teflon" is a case in point. This was a
laboratory curiosity before major markets were found for
it. If, in the beginning, we had to justify long tests of the
then experimental substance, costing perhaps as much as
$800,000, I venture that we would not have our major
"Teflon" business today, nor would we have all the jobs
and all the improved consumer products that "Teflon
fluorocarbons now make possible.
Admiral H.G. Rickover, the father of our atomic navy,
a few years ago wrote that "how in the future to make
wiser use of technology is perhaps the paramount P"D'|C
issue facing the electorates of industrial countries. It will
tax their mental resources and challenge their politick
acumen."
I agree with the Admiral and believe that certain
things suggest themselves.
As we approach the further regulation of chemicals
and all the other unavoidable risks of progress-in order
to manage them and thus reap the public benefits containe
therein—it seems to me that the public interest would be
served if more of the approach of the scientist and t«
engineer could be introduced into public policy decision •
This would include a basic reliance on the scienti
facts, wherever they might lead, instead of unsuppof,e
fears and conjecture.

versarial postures that now, in my opinion, hamper
nstructive relationships between government and in-
stry, that slow down what should be our mutual search
r the scientific and engineering facts.
This would include acknowledgment that the most
mans can do is reduce uncertainty to acceptable levels,
at science and engineering have their limits as well as their
iponsibilities.
This would include continuing recognition that more
an one kind of risk normally is involved, that we must
ly on the path of scientific evidence to guide public
cisions on the inevitable trade-offs among environmental,
fety, economic, employment and energy risks. All these
ctors are vital to the national interest, and that national
terest will suffer to the extent tunnel vision is applied
i any one of those factors to the relative exclusion of the
thers.
In the face of new economic realities and new political
)ncerns, I see the role of the engineer as central to our
uest for a higher quality of life amid tightening resources.
And I see that role as embracing more stringent perfor-
lance demands than your profession has ever before faced.
Admiral Rickover has summed up the challenges and the
pportunities that await engineers with his usual precision
if expression:
"As I see it," the Admiral has declared, "the most
mportant aspect of the engineers' code of professional
ethics ought to be the obligation to do nothing that will
unnecessarily aggravate future conditions of life ... his
greatest task is to do everything he can do to preserve
opportunities for a good life to coming generations who will
not be as rich in land and resources as we are today."
I know that you will be equal to such tasks because you
already have done so much in exactly that fashion.
We can and we will continue to fashion a higher quality
of life for our people through imaginative advances in
technology.
We can and we will continue to do that with safety
because the engineers and scientists at work on tech-
nical progress are people of high ethical caliber, who
will make certain that innovations do not raise unmanage-
able risks to public health or to the environment.
And I, for one, hope that you will go about your tasks
with a calm confidence in your obvious capabilities, re-
capturing some of that earlier sense of American boldness
and adventure that a temporary onset of national pessimism
has dulled.
Our country has been for 200 years a sort of continuing
risk that our tough-minded ingenuity permitted us to
manage and direct successfully—that is why we have made
so much unprecedented progress.
The day we start avoiding risks—in a futile search for a
totally safe society—will be the day our national greatness
starts to fade.

The biggest ice cube captivity — 20 feet square and
4 feet deep — is being put to work for heating and cooling
an experimental home at the Westinghouse Research
Laboratories here.
"Based on analytical studies done at the U.S. Energy
Research and Development Administration's Oak Ridge
Laboratory, we have built an experimental residential
heating and cooling system that uses a heat pump and
about 8000 gallons of water for its source of heat,"
said H.W. Szymanowski of the Westinghouse Laboratories.
"The electrical energy required by this combination is
about half that of today's conventional heat pump systems.
"We extract heat from the water during the winter
using the heat of fusion — the scientists' name for energy
released when water freezes — so that the pool is slowly
frozen. By spring it has become an almost solid block of ice.
"During the summer we use the ice for cooling, causing
it to melt. By fall the water is again ready for freezing."
Completed in March, 1975, the experimental heating
and cooling system at the Laboratories is serving as a trial
installation for working out the operating and control
procedures necessary to "balance" the system's output
for year 'round operation — to maintain the rati
freezing and thawing so that the right amount of I
and cooling capacity will be available as needed.
"The basic advantage of using the water-to-ice
source is that large energy exchange provided by the
process," said Mr. Symanowski.
"For example, each pound of water that is frozen \
yield 144 Btu's of heat energy to the heat pump systen
while the water-and-ice mixture remains at 32 degrees I
"In comparision, a pound of water above the fre
temperature yields only one Btu of heat energy for i
degree it is cooled.
"Thus, by utilizing the heat released when
freezes, we can provide a large capacity heat source i
a relatively small volume — about one cubic foot of I
for each square foot of floor area. Furthermore, the I
pump only runs during the winter heating cycle — the io
that results at the end of the cycle provides an essentrsHy
"free" sink of summer cooling."
I he advantage of the experimental system can k
appreciated by comparing it with a conventional heat

A huge block of ice — 20 feet square and four feet
deep - buried in the backyard of a test home at the
Westinghouse Research Laboratories here — is the source of
"heat" and "cold" for an experimental residential system.
During the winter heating cycle, heat is extracted from
the pool of water, causing it to freeze. During the summer,
the ice is used for cooling, causing it to melt.
(COP) for an conventional heat pump during winter heating
is about 2.0. In comparision, the COP for the experimental
system in the heating mode is about 3.0.
For summer cooling, the conventional heat pump runs in
the "opposite direction", with a COP of about 2.5 in the
Pittsburgh area.
The experimental system, on the other hand, operates
during the summer from its "free" source of cooling,
so that its combined heating and cooling COP is raised to
about 5.0.
Modified Experimental System
In northern latitudes, where heating requirements are
greater than cooling, the experimental system may make
too much ice. For this situation the system can operate
with a smaller pool of water — sufficient to provide
enough ice for summer cooling — and the winter heating
mode modified to control the rate of making ice so
that the pool is not completely frozen before the end
of the heating cycle.
"To test such a modified system at the Research Lab-
ortories, we have added solar heat collectors on the roof,"
said Mr. Szymanowski.
"The solar collectors will be operated during winter to
add heat to the pool and slow down its rate of freezing.
"Toward the end of summer, if the ice should be melting
too fast because of an unusually warm summer, the heat
pump can be operated at night to make more ice.
But instead of pumping heat into the house where it is not
yet wanted, the heat is rejected through the solar collectors
on the roof — which will become in effect a large cooling
radiator.
"Thus, the solar collector/radiator cooling system on the
roof provides the means for balancing the freezing and
thawing rates of the pool. The system can be used in
latitudes where there is a yearly imbalance in total heating
and cooling requirements, or it may be needed to handle
short term variations such as an unusually warm fall or an
unseasonably cold spring."
Installation of the solar heating/radiator cooling coils
on the roof of the building has been completed, and is
being tested during this winter's heating cycle.
"Operation of the experimental system will provide the
emperical design data that is needed to help optimize
its performance," said Mr. Szymanowski.
"Although Westinghouse has no present plans for
marketing this particular system, the information gained
should be useful in developing the energy-saving heating
and cooling system of the future."
*The COP of a heat pump is the ratio of heat energy provided for
housing heating to the electrical energy required to operate the heat
pump.

50 Years Ago
In 1926 commercial radio broadcasting was merely five
years old, yet a General Electric ad in the March 1926
Technic pictured a 250 kilowatt transmitter. As a com-
parison, the most powerful AM Broadcast stations in the
U.S. today have a maximum output of 50 kilowatts. 250
kilowatts is not bad for 1926. The transmitter looked more
like a plumber's nightmare than an electrical apparatus. It
contained inductors several feet in diameter. The resistors
were constructed from series-parallel combinations of
power resistors and there were enough gauges to stymie
an airplane pilot. Obviously something comparable to an
E.C.E. 331 lab.
Trivia question of the month: What was Prof. A.D.
Moore doing in 1926? It would be no gamble to say that he
was at Michigan, and you would be right. (Prof. Moore is a
veritable institution around here.) Handsome and musta-
chioed, the distinguished professor was also the National
President of Tau Beta Pi that year.
The following is an energy note extracted from the March
1926 Technic. It concerns alternative uses of natural Gas.
The first gas known or used to any extent
was natural gas, the gas that comes out of the
earth. In ancient Greece, a shepherd was once
wandering with his flock on a certain hill, on
which the oracle of Delphi was eventually
located, and suddenly for no reason that he
could see, he was partially overcome and
became hilarious, as if he had imbibed too much
of the fermented juice of the grape. The town-
folk saw in him and his plight incarnation of
some evil spirit but the priestecraft of the
country soon realized that here was an agency
of which they could make use. Thus was
founded the oracle of Delphi on the spot
where natural gas issued from the earth and the
priestess, being overcome by this earthly emana-
tion, delivered the oracle of the gods.
From the "Oh, ya! I knew I heard that somewhere before,'
Department:
Natural gas is still used in large quantities
in the United States, although the limited
character of the supply makes further develop-
50 and 25
Years Ago
by Ray Barry
mentof it's use impossible and in fact is already
curtailing the present uses to which it is put.
That was in 1926, with a few quick calculations youwil*
be surprised to learn that we ran out of natural gas
supplies 20 years ago.
25 Years Ago
What is the most bizarre example of recycling you've
ever heard of? Here's one that will compete for the top
slot in that category: chicken feathers can be made into
chicken feed. Find that hard to swallow? It's true, the
idea was presented in the March 1951 Technic. Chicken
feathers, which were previously useless and difficult to
dispose, were found to have potential as a raw material.
The process involved the collection of the feathers from
chicken processing plants, cooking them in a pressure
cooker, drying them, and grinding them into meal. The
processed feathers contained a large amount of a certain
amino acid important in chicken feed. The product
also had applications in fertilizers. Perhaps the process
could be expanded to other areas; human hair contains a
good deal of protein soylent green anyone?
One of the most consistent features of the Technic
of 25 years ago was the Dean's plug for the military on
"The Dean's Page", a regular column. It seems he never
missed an opportunity to encourage youngsters to join
the military. That's insulting, and what an attitude for a
Dean to have; telling his students to go get their brains
blown out! This month the Dean pointed out the financial
advantages in toting a gun for Uncle Sam and the travel
benefits. He seems to have forgotten that Korea was not
one of the hot tourist spots of the world, especially in
1951. MacArthur seemed to like it, but then there is no
accounting for taste.
From the "Gee, way back then?" Department:
Pollution control, contrary to popular belief, was not a
product of the '60's heightened social awareness and was
not invented by Ralph Nader. According to an article
in the May 1951 Technic England had smoke control
measures as early as the 14th century. The real problems
started with the industrial revolution. In 1930 sixty-three
people were killed and hundreds became ill in one inci-
dent. In 1948 eighteen persons were killed in Donora,
Pennsylvania. It makes one wonder, if the problem has
been around so long, then why?

With a little cooperation on your part—more than a little,
actually—you will awaken to find yourself transformed into
a scarce commodity, which is even nicer than turning into a
lovely butterfly.
You will owe this good fortune to two notions, both false:
1) engineering has proved an evil profession, 2) therefore
engineering jobs are drying up. The prevalence of these
notions in some circles has cut down the competition for
your share of the action in the world.
Yes, there has been a slackening. There have been times
when an emerging engineer might have had a choice of 30
otters. Today it may be only 5 or 6. Check with your non-
engineering friends on campus how many offers of profes-
sional-level employment they get these days. But then they
may not like engineering. (Switch out fast if you hate it
yourself.)
One rumor is true: that your engineering faculty, despite
their apparent friendliness, is out to make it as tough as
possible for you. It is your ability to survive their efforts to
grind you into the wall that makes you the precious com-
modity you are. Perhaps you already knew that.
And what's in it for you? Good access to the things that
money can buy and more of a chance than most people get
to shape the future as you think it ought to be shaped. We
are not the only organization that draws its decision-makers
from among those who came in expecting to spend their
careers contemplating engineering tables.
Nor are we the only company that could have signed this
ad. No matter how many offers you garner, you can accept
only one. A note about yourself is a first step toward deter-
mining whether that offer ought to be from us. Address it to
Kodak, Business and Technical Personnel, Rochester, N.Y.
14650.

engineers who are
revolutionary
at heart.
By revolutionary, we mean we're looking for engineers who
thrive on change.
There's a revolution going on, a technical revolution.
Every day, there are new changes. Changes in components
Products. Systems. Materials. Changes in processes. And even
in whole technologies.
General Electric needs engineers who like change.
Who can adapt easily to change. And who can use change
creatively.
Generally, we've found that the engineers who are
most responsive to change are those well grounded in
the fundamentals. Who have a broad view that helps
them evaluate and make use of changing technologies
Who are flexible. And who haven't become too special-
ized yet.
Are you that kind of engineer? General Electric is
that kind of company.
GE is constantly evaluating, developing, testing
and applying new technologies. That's one of the
reasons we're into so many
ness areas. And coming up
many new products.
If you're the kind of pe
who thrives on change, join
the technical revolution at
General Electric.

interview
an
Suppose you're having an interview with a
recruiter from Celanese.
Start by showing you've done your home-
work. Ask "Is it true that Celanese
Corporation is a diversified, multi-national
organization with important stakes in five
basic, high-technology industries—chemi-
cals, coatings, fibers, plastics and resins?"
Now you've made an impression.
Hold it with, "Am I correct that Celanese
has a very strong leadership position in
production of man-made fibers? That it
pioneered acetate and triacetate? Devel-
oped Fortrel polyester, including high-
efficiency processes for textured yarn,
staple and industrial yarns?'
You've got the interviewer's head bobbing
up and down.
But donl overdo it. Throw in a leading
question like, "What's the Celanese
position in chemicals?"
Pay attention when you're told that
"Celanese is now one of the largest U.S.
chemical producers. A world leader in
the production of formaldehyde, acetic
acid, vinyl acetate and methanol"
Good. Now sing out with this erudite bit,
"Those are the basic chemicals that in-
dustry's clamoring for, aren't they?"
You've got the idea. Lead him or her into
telling you that...
"Celanese is ahead in the plastics revolu-
tion with the development of a family of
engineering resins. The most complete and
useful available anywhere'.'
The art of making a great
impression by asking all
the right questions.
"Celanese offers thousands of coatings and
resin products including the resins used in
coating the Alaskan pipeline. It's one of
Detroit's leading suppliers of automotive
topcoats and undercoats"
Now hit home with a straight question,
"What kind of company is Celanese to
work for?'
Notice the smile with the reply, "Celanese
is a friendly place to hang your hat. With
an informal, shirt-sleeve, no-baloney at-
mosphere. Where there's opportunity for
fast professional growth, a sense of per-
sonal responsibility. Where you're never
slowed by formal programs or seniority.
But where performance and contribution
are always rewarded'.'
O.K., you know how to do it. Do it. If you
have a degree in engineering or chemistry,
have your placement officer set up an in-
terview. Or write John D. Grupe, Celanese

Where did the summer go? Wasn't is just yesterday that
we were scurrying around trying to meet the April deadline?
I guess there is no rest for the wicked. Here it is, October
already and all those articles I was going to write over the
summer are still floating around in the nebulous of my brain.
Oh well, maybe later.
The cover story this month is about amateur radio
satelites. "What?" you say. That's what I said, like most
people I did not know of their existance. I learned of them
one day last spring when a member of the U of M Amateur
Radio Club stumbled into the office and invited someone
over for a demonstration of their use. Ray Barry went over
and was enlightened. With the help of club member Larry
Koziel, Ray was able to compose the article contained
herein.
Next on the slate is the second place winner of last
year's Cooley Essay Contest. It is traditional for the Technic
to print the winners, and as usual, they're excellent. For
some reason there was no first place winner last time, so
we have the second place winner. It is a short story called
"New Standards" and was written by A. Stephen Toby.
Because of its exceptional length we have been forced torun
it in two parts. Next month we will print the second half
of the story.
New to the staff this year is Stephen Stathos, the author
of "Anatomy of a Bluebook." Steve has some interesting
experiences to relate concerning test taking. Steve is i
Senior in Electrical engineering.
Back after a period of inactivity is Steve Hayneck.Ste*
is also a Senior and has a few thoughts on school and
graduation. He calls it "Welcome Back?" Its somethii
you'll probably relate to.
Also from last year's batch of Cooley Winners we ha*
a couple of Poems that we hope you'll enjoy. And of
course, psuedo historian Ray Barry has put together another
revealing "50 and 25 Years Ago" containing the answers to
all the world's problems.
Note: We are looking for people to help with the publi-
cation of Technic. Artists and trainees for managers and
editors along with writing and layout people are needed now
Come by 3077 East Engineering, we're looking forward to
seeing you.

by Ray Barry
I wound my way up the stairs of the Union with a bit of
anticipation. Reaching my destination, a little out of breath,
I stepped into a small room. Facing me was a window;
emerging from the window was a bundle of cables which
led to the opposite side of the room. I turned and saw a
young bearded gentleman manipulating the controls to
station W8UM, the station belonging to the DM Amateur
Radio Club. The gentleman was Larry Koziel and W8UM
consisted of any equipment that could be begged, borrowed,
bought, or home built by the members of the club. I had
been invited up for a demonstration of Oscar 7, an Amateur
Radio communications satellite.
Larry gave me a brief explanation of what was to happen
as we waited for the satellite to appear over the horizon.
Using two antenna rotors, like those used on TV antennas,
Larry pointed his directional antenni at the point where the
satellite would first appear. One rotor was used to adjust
azimuth, the other elevation. Since the satellite would pass
over head and sink below the horizon in a matter of
twenty minutes, the antennae would require frequent
readjustment.
Just as I was wondering how one could tell the satellite
had risen, the noise level from the receiver increased and the
"di da" of Morse code communication could be heard. It
was like magic: now you hear me, now you don't.
Immediately Larry reached for his keyer and began
transmitting his own Morse code signals, trying to get a
contact.
On the surface the whole event might not seem very
amazing. However, the frequencies being used are normally
good for only line-of-sight, short range communications.
Larry was communicating with people thousands of mile5
away, far over the horizon. And the whole project was an
"Amateur" operation.
AMSAT (acronym for Radio Amateur Satellite Corpora
tion) is the organization responsible for Oscar 7 and it's
predecessor Oscar 6 (Oscar is an acronym for Orbiting
Michigan Technic


tellite users and supporters based in Washington D.C.
esent membership is estimated at 3000. Oscars 6 &amp; 7
;re conceived, designed, and built by AMSAT. They were
sembled in one of the members' basement. Although
VISAT has sponsored the satellites, their use is open to
y Amateur Radio operator throughout the world.
The Early Days
Oscars 1 - 4 were sponsored by a group called Project
scar. Inc. It was formed in 1961 by a group of engineer-hams
ho worked in the aerospace industry. Oscar 1 was launched
ec. 12, 1961. It was a 10 pound transmitter which
mply sent out the word "hi" in Morse code. Oscar 1
ide piggyback into space aboard a launch vehicle with
ime other prime payload, as all of the Oscars have. It
iased transmitting on Dec. 30, after having wetted the
iste of hams for more.
Oscar 2 was launched on June 2, 1963. Besides
ansmitting a simple "hi" message it also transmitted it's
imperature. The temperature controlled the rate of speed
t which the message was transmitted. Oscar 2 transmitted
3r 20 days.
A new phase of satellites began with Oscar 3. This was the
irst two way communications satellite for amateurs. It
eceived signals transmitted on the two meter ham band,
hifted the frequency of the signal, and retransmitted at a
ligher frequency. On March 9, 1965 Oscar 3 was put into
i 570 mile orbit. 176 two way contacts were made and
housands listened in before it died. Oscar 3 also transmitted
i beacon and telemetry parameters.
A launch vehicle malfunction prevented Oscar 4 from
fulfilling its expectations. However, it did manage to supply
the link for the first satellite communication between the
USandthe USSR.
AMSAT was formed on Jan. 9, 1969 consolidating
Project Oscar and several other groups from around the
world. The first AMSAT satellite was Oscar 5. It was built
in Australia at Melbourne University. Launch was Jan. 23,
1970 which was at the peak of the sun spot cycle. This
allowed for the study of the propagation of high frequency
radio signals during the peak of the cycle. The sunspot
cycle is known to have a big effect on lower frequency
signals which reflect off the ionosphere.
When Oscar 6 was launched in October 1972, its pro-
jected lifetime was one year. It is now celebrating its
fourth birthday and is still in use. Signals transmitted on a
portion of the two meter ham band are received by the
satellite which changes their frequency and retransmits them
on the ten meter ham band.
The path which Oscar 6 travels in is called a circular sun-
synchronous orbit. That isa polar orbit in which the satellite
always travels north to south on the Sun side and south to
north on the dark side. The period of the orbit is 115 min.
and its altitude is 900 miles. A permanent bar magnet which
aligns with the earth's magnetic field is used to stabilize the
satellite and keep the antennae properly oriented. Because
°f this the satellite flips over every time it crosses the poles.
Power is supplied by solar panels which charge Nickle-
Cadmium storage batteries. Regular on and off periods are
scheduled so that the batteries can be kept from running
down. The satellite can be turned on and off by any of
several ground stations around the world.
Oscar 6 also transmits telemetry data. It monitors
twenty-four different parameters, things like battery levels,
battery temp., temperatures of various other parts, currents
in each solar panel, voltages, and transmitter power. For
tracking purposes a beacon is transmitted.
The most recent satellite to be launched is Oscar 7.
It was launched into an orbit very similar to Oscar 6 on
Nov. 15, 1974. In fact, the two satellites are similar in
many ways. One of the major differences is that Oscar 7
was designed with a positive power budget so that the satellite
does not have to be turned off. Another major difference is
that Oscar 7 has two transponders and four beacons instead
of one of each.
Oscar 7 has four different operational modes. In mode A
two meter signals are received, converted to ten meters and
retransmitted. In mode B 70 cm signals are received and
retransmitted as 2 meter signals. Mode C is the same as
mode B except the power output of the transmitter is
reduced. Mode D is a recharge mode, only a beacon is
transmitted. The satellite can be commanded into any of
these modes from the ground stations, usually this isn't
necessary. The satellite is programmed for automatic
control. On even days of the year it goes to mode B, on
odd days of the year it goes to mode A. If the battery
charge drops below 60% the satellite switches into mode
C, then if the battery charge does not come up within 24
hours it switches to mode D. Modes C and D are not normally
used. They may become useful in extending the life of the
satellite as it ages because the solar cells and storage
batteries wear down with age.
There are 84 telemetry measurements for Oscar 7, 24
are available in Morse code, and 60 over teletype.

about 10 out of every eleven hours. ^——^^—^-,■
The Future
Just recently a launch opening became available for
late 1977. At the time there were no plans for another
Oscar 7 type satellite, all work was aimed at a new Phase III
satellite. Since the launch date became available and Phase
III could not be readied in time, AMSAT decided to put
another Oscar 7 type into orbit.
Phase III will be a new generation in Amateur Radio
satellites. It is presently AMSAT's main project and it is a
substantial one. First, and most importantly, a new type of
orbit is planned for this satellite. The orbit will be a polar
elliptical one similar to those used by the Russians. The
low point in the orbit (perige) will be over the South Pole
at an altitude of 900 miles. The high point in the orbit
(appoge) will be over the North Pole at an altitude of
24,000 miles. This is an obvious advantage for the Northern
Hemisphere. The satellite will be available for use in the
Northern Hemisphere for ten out of every eleven hours.
This type of orbit is more advantagious to northern areas
than a synchronous orbit.
Putting a satellite into such a high orbit requires that the
satellite have its own booster. The Phase III satellite will be
the first amateur radio satellite to have such. Firing a booster
requires precise attitude control, therefore electromagnets
will replace the bar magnets in previous satellites. A higher
orbit will also demand a more powerful transmitter. Oscar
6 has a one watt transmitter, Oscar 7 puts out eight watts
at the most. Phase III will have two fifty watt transmitters
Construction of the Phase III satellite is a world wide
project. The engineering design is being done in Germarry,
some of the electronics and checkout equipment is being
made in Canada, the Australians are making the command
and telemetry equipment, the US is organizing the project,
making the major purchases, and doing the final check-out
Another innovation with Phase III will be the use of a
CMOS microprocessor on board the satellite. This mini-
computer will take care of the regular "housekeeping"
routines as well as controlling the attitude and engine
firing. Since the engine will be fired at the South Pole, out
of reach of any command station, it must be fired by on
board command.
How to Use the Satellites
The first thing one must have is a sensitive receiver.
Since the transmitter power is not more than a few watts,
and this is split among the various signals being picked up.
a sensitive receiver is a must. The 10 meter down-link can
be picked up (frequency-wise) on most short wave receivers,
however,a preamplifier may be necessary to hear the signals.
The next thing one needs is a transmitter. If the 10
meter down-link is going to be used a 2 meter transmitter is
essential for the uplink. An amateur radio license is necessary
to operate such a transmitter. The recommended combina-
tion is an 80 - 100 watt transmitter and a non-directional
antenna. The non-directional antenna does not have to be
pointed at the satellite and frees the operator from constantly
adjusting it. If a directional antenna is used, the power must
be cut or the satellite will be over loaded because directional
antennas concentrate the power in a beam. Note that separate
antennae are necessary for the transmitter and receiver
because they use different bands.
Once the station is set up, the operator must be able to
predict the orbits. AMSAT publishes regular schedules of
equator crossing times. Using these times, the station loca-
tion and a few other pieces of information, the operator can
predict when the satellite will arrive.
With Oscars 6 and 7 a range of about 5000 miles is
possible, when Phase III is launched, the entire Northern
Hemisphere will come within range at one time. These
frequencies are normally capable of covering only a couple
of hundred miles. The unique aspect of using the satellite is
that transmission is on a different frequency than reception,
it is therefore possible to pick up one's own transmission
coming back from the satellite. Care must be taken in
trying to tune in a certain frequency because the dopp'er
shift is quite evident and will shift frequencies from where
one would expect them to be.
Experiments
AMSAT members are not simply satisfied with building
the satellites and getting them up. Using them and
experimenting with them is at least three-fourths of the
fun, especially since only a small portion of the members

jery fascinating experiments have been done.
One experiment involved locating the position of an
ergency locator transmitter (ELT). An ELT is a small
"table transmitter carried aboard airplanes and is used to
d downed aircraft in the event of a crash. The transmitter
•d had an output power between one-half and one watt
i a non-directional natenna. The return signal was tape
orded at Goddard Space Flight Center Optical Sight.
&gt;cessing of information obtained from the doppler shift
ulted in locating the ELT within 12 km. Estimates pre-
3 - G km potential.
Using a method designed by the AMSAT members,
!Ctrocardiogram signals were transmitted from Santa Ana,
lifornia and received at Bethesda, Maryland after passing
rough the satellite. The signals were recorded on paper
ae. The received pattern was an acceptable one much like
e original.
Contacts have been made through the satellite from cars,
tats and airplanes. In fact, there is no limit that a ham
an't go to in order to make a unique contact. They have
ten known to climb mountains and go to various other
rtremes.
The Oscar satellites have been used in a research project
/ one University professor. They were used in gathering
ita for a study on the propagation of radio waves through
ie upper atmosphere.
AM SAT-Oscar users were granted a special permit by the
CC to use ASCII on the frequencies used by the satellites.
iSCII is one coding system for transmitting teletype sig-
Oscar 6 and 7 travel in circular polar orbits. These
satellites cross the equator at a 101 degree angle which give
them a slightly westward movement as shown above.

Our search for energy begins with people.
America needs energy.
Its economy depends on it.
But to find it, Gulf needs minds.
Good minds.
The search for energy is not a simple
problem, and there will be no simple
solutions.
It demands people with a wide
variety of talents and skills. People with
imagination, determination, ingenuity,
and perseverance.
No other industry today offers such
an amazing diversity of complex, sophis-
ticated problems—problems that must
be solved today and problems that may
take 20 years to solve.
The energy business has changed.
Its no longer simply a matter of locating
and producing crude oil.
We need to search for it in strange,
difficult locations.
We need to develop energy resources
without destroying or polluting our
environment.
We need to go beyond known sources
of energy and explore alternatives such
as oil shale, geothermal power, tar sands,
coal, and solar power.
But first we need people.
Chemical and petroleum engineers,
geologists, geophysicists, geological
engineers, chemists, and mining engineers.
Gulf Oil Corporation has allocated
some $1,000,000,000 to be spent this year
on energy development programs in the
United States alone.
If you think you can contribute to
the search, see your college recruiter or
write Virgil Hanson, Human Resources
Department, Gulf Oil Corporation, Gulf

••* The permit was a temporary one which has since been
^newed several times. The importance of this permit is
1 it allows communication between computers and
wrcmunication between teletype and computer through
e satellite. Some very successful experiments have been
done in this area.
Just
recently some of the first pictures to come back
m the Viking lander were transmitted via the satellite
'° England using slow scan television (SSTV). SSTV is a
form of television which takes up less band space than
regular TV and which hams are allowed to use.
Some very freaky contacts have been made with the
satellites. One was made between California and Iceland,
another between California and England, and another
between the West Coast and Japan.
Microprocessors are the latest development in electronics,
and like everyone else, the satellite users are finding their
own application for them. One ingenious user has his micro-
computer set up to calculate orbits, doppler shifts, antenna
azimuth and elevation, and current position of the satellite
for four different locations simultaneously. This micro-
processor communicates with a second microprocessor which
adjusts his antenna and corrects for the doppler shift auto-
matically.
Hams have always been known for their public service
activities. One of their most important has been providing
communication links in disaster areas; getting help, relaying
messages, notifying authorities, etc. Many hams pride them-
selves on their ability to set up an emergency station at
any time. This tradition is not to be lost in the satellite age.
Work is being done on the development of portable stations
to be shipped to disaster areas in time of need. They will
have the capability of working through the phase III
satellite.
Miami area hams aren't waiting for a disaster to happen,
they have set up a hurricane watch network which operates
through the satellites.
The American Radio Relay League (ARRL), one of the
major supporters of AMSAT is promoting the use of the
satellites in education. They have published a manual for
classroom use which covers the basics of satellite operation,
prediction of orbits, directions on tracking, and the mathe-
matics involving orbits and telemetry signals. The manual
is intended as a tool to be used in the classroom for
augmenting mathematics, physics, science, astronomy, com-
munications and electronics classes. Many of the users go
around to schools giving demonstrations and explanations.
Teachers have used it as a motivational tool in high school
physics and mathematics classes. Wednesdays have been
set aside as demonstration days. On these days all users are
asked to refrain from using the satellites unless they are
participating in a demonstration.
One thing is for sure, this is a long way from CB, good
buddy.
For anyone interested, AMSAT is currently looking for
help (with or without experience) in the design and con-
struction of satellites and computerized ground stations

1976 Cooley Essay Contest Second Prize Winner
A Short Story by A. Stephen Toby
It was a fine summer afternoon in 1990, and the sea
seemed to stretch our into infinite distance on all sides as
the flagship steamed northwestward. The long, regular
swell approached the ship's starboard bow, whitecaps
glittered in the sun, but there came to the officer on the
bridge no sensation of its passing. The ship advanced
without sound and without motion, except for the faint
whistle of the wind in the rigging and the graceful rippling of
the brilliant blue ensign at the main gaff. From the
taffrail the onrushing sternwave sounded like distant
thunder and one might detect some slight vibration from
the engines; on the open forebridge one was above all that.
The ship seemed to move forward of her own accord and
with complete indifference as to her destination.
To the officer on the bridge, there was something not
quite right about the entire situation. As Captain Hendrik
Jarvis, Royal Netherlands Navy, he had grown used to
ships that rolled crazily in this kind of sea, shook as if
falling apart at this speed, and completed with their
stealthy gray presence a scene of high and confused gray
seas under an overcast sky. This ship, though a warship,
seemed more like an ocean liner, with her teak decks and
white-enamel sides. The ship seemed to gleam like a
mirror under a dazzling sky. And the officer was in a
different service, with a different rank. At Jarvis's elbow,
inlaid in solid gold bullion into the teak railing, was the
North Pole projection of the world that had long been the
symbol of the United Nations. And now Hendrik Jarvis
was Fleet Admiral of the United Nations Navy, supreme
commander of the new strategic battle fleet, and answerable
only to the Board of Admiralty, the Code of Honour,
and his conscience for anything he did.
His flagship was the most powerful ship in the world.
The UNN Guided Missile Dreadnought "Valinor" was over
1600 feet long and displaced 300,000 tons. She had a
regular service speed of 51 knots and a maximum of 55;
the power came from twelve nuclear reactors driving four
steam-turbine water jets with directional nozzles. No
rudder was necessary. The "Valinor" was heavily armored,
including her water jets, so that she could absorb a large
number of hits from conventional weapons and remain
fully operational. It had even been calculated that a
direct hit from a fifteen megaton nuclear warhead would
leave her still afloat and under command. The UNN had
spent nearly a hundred billion dollars on the ship; nothing
had been spared to make her the finest warship afloat. She
was armed with guided missiles of five types. On her
builder's tactical diagram they were represented by five
concentric circles, representing the extreme range of each
type of missile. Admiral Jarvis had nicknamed them the
Ringsof Power. The Strategic Ring was composed of MIRVed
ICBM's for all-out strategic offense. The Tactical Offense
Ring, five hundred sea miles from the ship, used Russian-
built surface-to-surface "cruise" missiles. At one hundred
sea miles the Antisubmarine Ring stood guard with missiles
that could drop homing torpedoes over the target. The two
remaining rings were defensive, and were called the
Skyshields. The Outer Skyshield used one type of missile
with two types of warheads. One was a sophisticated
active-homing SAM that could destroy either airplanes or
missiles in mid-flight up to two thousand miles away; the
other was a nuclear ABM. The Inner Skyshield comprised
dual-purpose missiles (modified U.S. Navy Standard 2's)
for "hard-point" defense at thirty sea miles.
The waterfront was an ugly place, raised above high-water
mark on rotting piles before an irregular row of crumbling
buildings. Piles of garbage choked the narrow streets running
inland from it, and oil and floating debris filled the harbor.
In places, sections of the piers had collapsed into the water.
Grass was growing up through the broken pavements. The
United Nations ambassador to Tanzania felt ridiculously
out of place driving through the ruins in his air-conditioned
Rolls-Royce. He had been thirty years in Africa, but places
like the waterfront at Dar es Salaam still dismayed him
after the smart, efficient little Embassy. What disturbed
the ambassador most were the clotheslines stretching from
their glassless windows, their hoists of laundry like signal;
of distress from the derelict buildings. This annoyed hirr
because, in his younger days, he had always assumec
places like this were abandoned. They obviously were not,
in spite of vigorous efforts to make them so; and the
ambassador felt uncomfortable when reminded of them
The car door swung open, and the ambassador had tc
gasp for breath as he stepped out. The blinding sun anc
awesome heat seemed to deal his head a crushing blow, anc
to stab him through the chest every time he inhaled. Ar
honor guard stood more or less at attention, the Tanzaniar
and UN flags side by side, drooping limply. They walkec
slowly over rotting planks, as soft underfoot as damp earth
to the boat-landing at the pierhead. The officer of the guarc
offered the ambassador a pair of binoculars; they wen
large and heavy.
The ambassador stared through the binoculars as througt
the porthole of the world. He was eager to see the "Valinor/

for he did not think of her as a ship, but as a daydream tha

Finally she slid into the harbor, leaving very little wake.
She was low and graceful, with three black airfoil - section
masts spaced with exquisite symmetry; white sides and
stainless deck fittings shimmered in the sunlight. The
ambassador thought her strangely insubstantial for anything
so huge, like a vision; and indeed she was that, he thought,
looking ruefully about him. There was no sharper contrast
on earth than this one, between the heat and the stench
and the squalor of Dar es Salaam fading away into the
wilderness ashore, and the lovely white flagship like a
dream of order coming in from sea.
With the blue ensign streaming from its stern-staff, a
resplendent white fiberglass launch with teak deck and
sheer rail came howling in from the ship. Flying spray
glittered in the sunlight as the launch sped in towards the
landing, planing at fifty knots. Cries of dismay from
shore were echoed by the shriek of twin gas turbines at full
throttle. The boat came to a stop not six inches from the
pier. Admiral Jarvis stood up in the sternsheets, saluted the
officer at the helm, then the six sideboys dressed in white.
Then he stepped onto the dock, and the boatswain's
whistle died away into silence.
The admiral's light blue uniform glittered with gold
braid. The UN insignia was embroidered onto his front
pocket; above it hung medals won in the service of Queen
Juliana. At his belt he wore a sword in a platinum scabbard;
set in a golden hilt, the pommel flashed with jewels.
"Attendez-moi ici," he told the officer at the helm; then,
turning towards the ambassador, he said, "Bonjour, Monsieur
I'Ambassadeur. Vous connaissez ma consigne, n'est-ce pas?"
"I am sorry, sir," replied the ambassador. I speak only
English. I was informed that an interpreter would not be
necessary —"
"Quite right. My father was English, so it's just as well
that you speak it. English and Dutch were my first
languages, but French is the official language of the UNN,
so I try to use it as much as possible."
The ambassador could not suppress a sigh of relief; a
clerical error in his orders could have confused matters
badly. The admiral preceded him into the capacious back
seat of the car as he announced that they would go to the
Embassy. "There I can explain the situation that brought
you here, and tell you the recommendations of the Board
of Admiralty. Afterwards you are scheduled to visit the
President. "Jarvis remained silent. Theambassador continued,
"Would you mind answering a few questions while we're
driving to the Embassy?"
"I suppose not." The car was gliding smoothly down a
narrow street lined with buildings of several stories, with
storefronts on the ground floor. The buildings seemed to
waver in the heat, as if over a flame.
"When I watched the 'Valinor' come into port I was
surprised. I had expected something new and revolutionary,
and what I saw took me back to the turn of the century.
One does not expect a force which is a new and revolution-
ary concept to use the ceremonial of the British Navy of a
century ago. And for the first time since the world wars, a
ship of war has been made beautiful. Not only beautiful, for
when I was young there were many warships of graceful
design and fine proportion, but . . . pretty. What possess
the Board of Admiralty to paint her white, or to waro
money on teak decks? Don't you think it smacks of r«
seventeenth century?"
"Absolutely," Jarvis agreed. "And I would not be hat
if it didn't. Naval officers are traditionalists, after all, if
things have been done one way for a thousand years, that is
the way that works. You do not win a man's loyalty ny
rejecting the long-established tradition that made him, even
if some new idea is objectively better. But if you can maie
him believe your new idea will add to the tradition without
destroying it, if in fact you can consummate the longings it
has always carried with it, at a stroke you will makethi
tradition greater and the man more loyal, to it and to you
Nevis Talbot, the fellow who invented the UN Navy, for
that very reason represented it as a step backwards, 3'
attempt to recapture bygone splendors and achieve the
dream of every navy since the world began - dominion
over every sea in the world. And thus was the alliance
formed; and the Old Guard marched out to strike a blew
for the brave new world."
"You mean this isn't for the benefit of potential
aggressors?" asked the ambassador. "I thought it was a
way of flaunting the UN's power before the nations."
"Well, I suppose there's that too .. . Talbot is a brilliant
man, and it may be that the full intent of his aesthetic stan
dard is beyond the vision of the officers that serve his ships
For I thought only of the morale of the officers and men,
and the satisfaction of our financial supporters throughout
the world. It never occurred to me that sucha force might also
demoralize an outsider. But you too are of the old guard.
Modern men would not understand either of these reasons
for emphasizing good looks in the new ships. Glory has passed
beyond their comprehension, and they are the poorer for it.
"I have always thought it a triumph of what is best in
man for evil to be surrounded by beauty. It is a silly gesture,
perhaps; but it diminishes the horror somewhat."
Shocked, the admiral stared at the ambassador for some
time. "You don't understand . . . you see the irony, but not
the glory." He sighed. "I have heard much of the relativity
of all things, but the nature of the men of today is such that
after speaking a great truth they throw dust in each others
eyes and it avails them nothing. Man has not changed, the
world is the same. In every age there have been certain
things against which mens minds are locked and barred
and shuttered. For the Victorian age it was sex; in the
Dark Ages, religion; and for us it is war. Can no one see
that war is relative too, that at times peace can be a greater
evil? Because of the fleet which I command, billions of men
live without fear of attack. Because of my fleet, no ship
fears to fly her flag by day, or burn her lights at night
Because of my fleet an order reigns on land and sea that

more loudly, he added, "Yes, I too would have this evil.
But let us never forget that any good you do will be at the
cost of some evil. This does not mean that it won't be well
worth it, and a great triumph. When you fight your first
battle, you may win great honor for yourself and for your

you will never, never be pure again."
The car came to a stop at the foot of a long marble
staircase leading up to the embassy. The building looked
surprisingly small, almost the size of a suburban house. The
admiral and his companion got out of the car and walked
slowly up the steps, somewhat dazzled by the heat and light
that radiated from the staircase.
The ambassador's office was cold, and so dark by com-
parison with the sunlit staircase that the admiral nearly
tripped over his chair. The ambassador began, "How much
do you know about your mission here?"
"I was told to come to Dar es Salaam because the
Tanzanians were making threatening maneuvers with their
army." Jarvis replied. "I was told that you would advise
me further on how the situation looks at the moment."
"To begin with, what you were told was all we knew.
But since last month we have discovered that the Tanzanian
military demonstration was not intended to frighten neigh-
boring countries.
The UN fact-finding probes and UN Naval Intelligence
both agree that the maneuvers are actually a prelude to
sending a large force of infantry, aircraft and armor south
into Zambia ..." the ambassador paused a moment so that
his next word would have maximum effect. It struck the
admiral like a mine hit in waters already cleared by
minesweepers: "Unopposed."
"Do the Zambians know that this invasion is coming?"
asked the admiral after a long pause.
"Yes. They have prepared fuel and stores for it. The
experts say that the Zambians are also making ready forces to
accompany it to a point near Victoria Falls just short of the
Rhodesian border. Furthermore, large numbers of Kenyan
infantry and armor are gathering on the outskirts of the
port of Nombasa, where several transports recently comman-
deered for the Kenyan Navy are based. A number of
warships have also come to call recently at Diego Suarez.
There was a major naval base there during World War II,
though of course you can't remember it. Let's see," the
ambassador rummaged around in a filing cabinet. Finally
he drew out a bulging file. Stamped on its front was the
title: "Major Warship Movements, Sector Two, Indian
Ocean: January to June 1990."
"According to Naval Intelligence," the ambassador
began, with the open file on his desk, "Several Chinese
submarines have moved into the area, along with a full
squadron of some thirty patrol boats and two small des-
troyers and several supply ships. There is also a very
considerable Dutch detachment; you will not of course
have to be reminded of Holland's treaty with Kenya.
The Dutch have two cruisers, an aircraft carrier, and seven
destroyers, all at Diego Suarez, and some ten gunboats and
a supply ship somewhere at sea. I think at this point it is
safe to say that Kenya, Zambia, Tanzania and possibly
Uganda have pooled their forces for an assault on so^
common enemy. I suggest that, whatever country they
intend to attack, this action is international aggressionaid
you should try to stop it. Therefore I suggest that, wber.
you talk to the president of Tanzania, you might make *
clear that you won't stand idly by while an invasion is going
on. It is important that you make a good impression, since
the heads of state of the other countries involved will be
listening on television."
The office of the President of Tanzania was a pteassrr
place, well-lit by picture-windows from floor to ceiling anc
side by side along two of its walls; these windows were
separated by narrow girders. The view was blocked only by
a waist-high handrail. The President's desk stood on a to*
platform at the corner where the two walls of windows met
The desk itself was so vast that not even its stark, un-
aesthetic design succeeded in offsetting its ostentatiousness.
It was made of some dark, polished wood.
The president himself was a huge, vigorous African in his
fifties. Whenever he leaned back his black vinyl cha;r
creaked alarmingly; his bulk seemed ready to overflow the
chair at any moment and spill across the floor. Admiral
Jarvis thought the President's skin was exactly the same
color as the "Valinor's" masts, that is, off-black; this was
the natural color of boron-carbon composite, the strong,
light material of which they were made. The admiral
advanced towards the desk as a servant announced his
arrival, then hastily left and closed the door behind him.
Television cameras were nowhere in evidence.
The President heaved himself up from his chair with
astonishing speed, rushed up to the admiral, and shook his
hand so violently that Jarvis thought it was about to come
off. The President greeted him with great show of friendship
and offered him a large chair upholstered in black vinyl; it
was in fact identical to the president's chair. President
Mbwerere then navigated his way back to his own chair -
the floor shook at his every step — and turned to face
Jarvis.
"Well," the president said, "To what, or whom, do I
owe the honor of this visit?"
"I think, Mr. President, that the answer to that question
is well known to you. Your country and some of its
neighbors are preparing armament. It is my duty to inform
you that I am obliged to resist any attempt at offensive
warfare with all the force at my command."
The president replied, "But you don't know who we
plan to attack. It happens that the free nations of East
Africa are at last ready to liberate the oppressed people of
South Africa from the racist, fascist government now in
power there . ..." A long and obviously well-rehearsed
speech followed, given with great conviction. The president
ended by saying, "our comrades from China have come to
help us, and the Dutch, your own people, have sent ships
to help our allies. Would it not be better to side with us
yourself than to make idle threats? Freedom is like
progress; once it takes hold it cannot be stopped.'
The admiral could not help being annoyed. This was the
same warmed-over rhetoric that had been used for half a
century to justify bloody expansionist wars on humanitarian
grounds. In most cases Jarvis could have laughed outright,
16

happened to be quite right about the government of South
Africa; Jarvis himself would not be sorry to see that
government fall from power. But the Code of Honour was
quite explicit on the conduct of the UNIM with respect to
any war. The Code said: "The UN guarantees the territorial
integrity of all nations regardless of their form of govern-
ment. The UNN must therefore defend all countries with
equal vigor even if the officers in authority believe the
attacking country or countries to be justified in any
specific case." The Code was thus forcing Jarvis to play the
part of the villain. Understandably, he was resentful about it,
but, determined to put up a good front and do his duty,
he responded decisively after a long echoing pause, 'The
purpose of the United Nations Navy is to make all nations
safe from attack and avoid the waste inherent in large
national military establishments. 'All nations' includes South
Africa. If your forces attempt to invade that country I
shall reduce this city to radioactive rubble. It's my job.
Don't you see that if I had the liberty to take whichever
side I wished, I would have attacked your much-vaunted
ally, China, as soon as I had taken up my command?
China is just as oppressive as South Africa."
The admiral stood up, turned around, and walked
quickly to the door. As he opened it and passed through, he
was fully aware that the president had launched into another
tirade.
The UN ambassador to Tanzania sighed as he shut off his
closed-circuit television set. The admiral had been too
blunt; he was taking the advice of the Board of Admiralty
('Take a firm, forceful stand,") a bit too literally. But of
course he knew his job best; the ambassador decided to
withhold praise or blame until the results became evident.
The admiral sat in the "Valinor's" launch as it sped
away from shore. He held a briefcase in his lap; it was
stuffed full of papers covering warship movements in ex-
haustive detail. He was still irritated, but the steady,
rumbling whine of the engines and the fleeting coolness of
wind-thrown spray on his face had a tranqualizing effect.
BY the time the launch came alongside "Valinor" at the
foot of the accomodation ladder, Jarvis was half asleep.
Early the next morning, the admiral sat at a computer
console in the Battle Command Room far below the water-
line. The captain of the "Valinor" sat beside him. Between
them the papers on warship movements were scattered
across the desk-like shelf jutting out of the console above
knee level. The BCR was a large room with no ports of any
kind. All four walls were lined with electronic equipment:
computers, radar repeaters, sonar repeaters, and computer-
fun display screens labeled "Strategic Data System,"
"Tactical Data System," and other such names. Imme-
diately in front of the admiral was one of these screens.
It looked like a television screen, but a sign above it said:
Major Warships". The captain pushed a button, and a
sheer and deck plan of a small aircraft carrier appeared on
th|e screen. "That's the 'Van Tromp,' " said the captain.
A long succession of lists — of the carrier's aircraft and
other weapons — succeeded the carrier on the screen.
'Van Tromp'doesn't look like a very serious challenge,"
a|d the admiral. "She has no nuclear capability and no
missiles. Her planes don't carry anywhere near enough
electronic deception gear or air-to-air missiles to penetrate
the Skyshields, even all at once leaving their ship undefen-
ded."
"Quite true, sir," replied the captain. "But the Dutch
have other ships." Looking at his papers, he continued,
"For instance, there's the cruiser 'De Ruyter.' " Reading
from the screen, he continued, "Built 1953. Guided missile
conversion 1977 - 8, to double-ended surface-to-air US
Navy Standard Ones and Asroc. Twelve thousand tons,
service speed 31."
"You need not tell me about 'De Ruyter,' Captain. I
served in her as first lieutenant. You need not remind me
that 'De Zeven Provincien' is with her, single-ended with
Standard Twos; I commanded her for five years."
"I'm sorry,"the captain responded contritely. "I suppose
it isn't pleasant to be pitted against your own ships."
"It's quite terrible of course — but we can destroy
them easily, even with the Chinese ships you've shown me
on their side. It will be no contest, and I intend to confer
with the Dutch commander and tell him so. Then, perhaps,
we won't have to engage the Dutch fleet at all. Have warnings
been sent to the military and naval commanders-in-chief?"
"Yes," was the captain's response. "Your conference
with the Dutch Admiral has already been scheduled, for
tomorrow morning at 0900 hours. And, one more thing .. ."
"Yes?"
"The Tanzanian Government has served us a 24-hour
notice to leave this port. They are, of course, within their
rights, so we had better leave after our appointment with
the Dutch admiral."
"That's not very friendly of them," Jarvis remarked.
"Was this in response to my conversation with the president,
or my warning to the commanders?"
"Both apparently. They don't seem likely to back down,
regardless of the force arrayed against them."
The admiral thought otherwise, and said so. "It's not that
they are so determined, I think, but that they don't quite
believe that we are willing to use that force. If necessary,
we can resolve their doubts for good. It will be an example
to the world that the UN is at last a force to be reckoned
with."
Admiral Jarvis's cabin occupied nearly the whole of
Forward Bridge Deck 02 directly under the command
bridge and open forebridge. The cabin comprised a large
living-room or "day-cabin," with large portholes on three
sides: a night-cabin or small bedroom; an office; and a
bathroom. The Dutch Admiral had been shown into the
day-cabin at precisely 0900. When Jarvis entered the room,
his colleague was sitting on one of the leather-upholstered
armchairs, his legs extended comfortably under the marble
tea table. He got up as Jarvis entered and they shook
hands. They sat down on opposite sides of the table, as
if squaring off for a fight.
"Vice-Admiral Jan Doorman, Royal Netherlands Navy,"
the Dutch Admiral introduced himself. Jarvis responded in
kind. Doorman began in Dutch. "I take it you have called
this conference to add something to the warning you broad-
cast on the radio. It was most forceful. I congratulate you
on it."

understand that I am willing to back up that warning. You
•nust have read the UNN Code of Honour. My obligations
are clear, and you would do the same in my place."
"Indeed," Doorman replied. "But you must know my
position also. I believe that South Africa and its neighbors
are unjust, oppressive governments. The path of justice is
to make war upon them, for otherwise, when do you
think they will be stripped of their power to do evil?
Never, save by revolution, and revolution always creates
more evil that it destroys. Remove the power behind the law,
however unjust the law, and the natural tendency of man
to judge himself less harshly than his neighbor will take
over and make injustice universal. But if such an order is
conquered, it is replaced immediately by the conqueror's
and a better one can be created. This is what I am trying
to do; if I succeed, the world will be made better; would
it not be better for you to fight on the right side?"
The sunlight seemed unbearably bright. It glared through
the portholes with the pitiless intensity of a searchlight
beam in darkness. The Fleet Admiral said, "This is the
flaw in the new order of things. It protects all governments
equally, and all governments are not equal. But if it did
not guarantee autonomy for all governments, none would
have consented to it. And although it is true that the new
order is not perfect, it is still a good order. It has ex-
changed the evil of war's continual threat for the evil of an
end to the possibility of deliverance from without in the
case of bad governments. All wars of conquest are prohibited.
Of course some of these wars are good, but the world
will not continue to pay a huge price for such rare benefits.
Doorman, we can no longer afford crusades. War is grown
too vast, the weapons too deadly, the cost too great.
I command a force much greater than yours. If you resist.
I shall destroy you, and then assault the allies you were sent
here to protect. The side of justice is not always the right
side to fight for. It would be better, for the peace of the
world and for your own safety, if you did not stand in my
way. I do not ask that you fight with me, only that you
take the gunboat in which you came, go back to Diego
Suarez, and remain there while I follow my destiny. For
there lies the path of honor."
Doorman put his head in his hands and after a long
silence, began in a subdued voice, "You are right. The
world is not perfect and cannot be made so. My battle
against you shall be without hope and without purpose.
But I will still fight it, because I would not be a man if I
did not strike a blow for justice where I could. The act
itself is its own purpose, its own triumph. Who is right
I do not know; perhaps no mind of mortal man can say;
but I too have obligations, sir, to the past and to my
allies. You are a man of honor, among the few that re-
main; you shall sink my ships and kill my men, but I hold
Vou blameless, if you will only say you know why I resist.
I can see the right on your side; can you see that there is
honor also in the course I have chosen?"
Jarvis had sunk back in his chair until he was almost
lying down. His voice came dimly as from great distance:
I see now . . . you can see that I am right, but you must
De faithful to what you are. It is the same with me. We
fight each other, yet we both struggle for the same thing.
You see. Truth is like a vast gem with a billion facets, a
jewel that makes its own light from within, sometimes
more intense, sometimes faint, and always changing color.
Each man can see only his tiny facet, and perceive the
changes in the light that reaches him from it. But it is to
our overlasting glory that through words, spoken and written,
we can give other men a glimpse of what our facet is like
at the time we see it. Through the mirror of language I
have seen your facet and you have seen mine, and we know
other facets from long ago by reading what dead men have
written. This is our glory, and our anguish. I absolve you
of all blame as you have absolved me; for though we
would kill each other, we are fighting on the same side.
Someday, perhaps, we will know many facets of the jewel
of Truth, if we are spared death in the coming battle.
Then we will be able to act with more complete knowledge
and will have a greater chance of doing good in an absolute
sense. For now, each of us must follow his own vision of
truth, with the thought continually in mind that it may
not be the right one. And this thought makes us greater,
for I will show mercy if I can, to make the evil I do as small
as possible."
"Thank you, sir. I shall do the same if such an unlikely
situation occurs. Also ..." He paused. "If I live ... I
should be proud to serve under you in the UNN, because
. . . because I have realized that in the light of our united
perception of several facets of Truth, I am wrong. The
truth in my facet, the good done in crusades, is but a
phantom of the past. It is wrong for two men of honor
to set out to kill each other for the sake of the same
jewel. Only very rarely can one smite a man who has turned
from the light, to make a genuine crusade. But this is one of
those times. For this I have waited and hoped all my life;
to let this chance go by would be to close my eyes to all
the light I know. Therefore, I shall strike a blow for what
I have known to be right and yield only afterwards to what
is generally true. I have no choice."
"Admiral Doorman, you are a Lord among men in the
ancient sense. Your only fault is to have understood several
facets of Truth only after the light had faded from them as
the world changed. I am honored to have served as your
mirror, and will be proud to have you serve with me as you
follow the light; for you are the richer for having understood
the ancient facets of the warlords before their light faded, and
I shall be richer to have you under my command. Farewell!
The glory of your knowledge is great and your deeds in
the coming battle will not be the less glorious because you
know they may be wrong."
And they said their farewells, and the little gunboat
motored away from the "Valinor's" side as the great UNN
battle-ensign dipped slowly in salute from the stern-staff.
The gunboat picked up speed fast; then, near the harbor
entrance, it rose slowly and majestically on its foils, until
its hull was clear of the water. Spray flowed smoothly up
from its foils and around its gray hull, to swirl like smoke
in its wake. Then the flag came in from the stern-staff, the
capstan began to turn, and the anchor chain clanking in
through the hawsepipe, as electric motors somewhere in the
depths of the "Valinor" weighed anchor.
To be continued next month.

a Bluebook
Steve Stathos
I awoke that fateful morning with sudden awareness of
an ominous sound. I immediately realized that one of two
things had occurred; either the enemy had launched an air
attack on the building, or my alarm clock had just gone off.
Fortunately for the rest of the world it was my alarm. I
wasn't quite sure myself, for I had an hourly this morning.
Actually it was only a "fifty minutely" but in engineering
you learn to make approximations. This was one of the
crudest.
To prepare for my confrontation I knew it was essential
to keep my mind off the exam material. I forced myself to
recite state capitals aloud. All was going well until I got to
Delaware, but by then it was time to leave anyway.
I arrived on campus about ten minutes to the hour with
only one thought in mind: "Don't forget to buy a bluebook."
Entering the bookstore, myr right hand instinctively
searched my pocket for a quarter. This was going to be an
open book test so I wasn't about to take any chances.
Having checked my baggage, I proceeded through customs
and received the usual suspicious glance. I scooped up one
lined bluebook of the two for fifteen cents variety, opting
to pay the extra penny rather than buy two and give one
away to some forgetful stranger.
Quicker than you could say "cash or charge", I was
standing in the treacherous checkout line. In front of me was
a man attempting to purchase a 1947 picture postcard of
the Union, three paper clips and a single bookend. Of course,
the bookend had no price on it; a fact which the cashier
chose to determine emperically by holding it up to the light
at every imagineable angle.
I heaved a long sigh and began to wonder why bluebooks
were so named. Perhaps the name had evolved from the
observation that after an exam students felt blue, and color
was merely added later as an advertising gimmick by some
sadistic pundit.
I returned to the world of reality, realizing three things:
it was possible to buy one bookend; the bookstore accepted
First Bank of Cleveland travelers checks; and my last
vestige of monetary worth was ten feet away guarding my
books. Mumbling sheepishly I rescued my quarter from the
clutches of that permalloy protectorate.
I returned to the checkout and saw the cashier was
busy repeating her previous ritual, this time with an unpriced
ashtray. Not wanting to infringe on anyone else's rites, I
quietly removed my still to be purchased bluebook from the
counter and replaced it with my quarter. The economics of
the transaction bothered me somewhat. However, my
displeasure was more than compensated by the fact that
my effort in self service had indeed been noticed by the
store security. I wouldn't have to worry about missing the
exam because I was accused of shoplifting bluebooks.
Arriving at my normally spacious classroom on the hour.
I found it packed. I mean it was full. It was so full, there
wasn't even room for Jello. I made my way to a seat in the
back, passed several people I hadn't seen in years. How
unfortunate, I thought, that all these people chose this, of
all days, to add the course. Taking my seat, I claimed
sovereignty over the three square feet before my by staking
out the area with books, and other assorted paraphernalia.
Once firmly entrenched, I became increasingly aware of
the people around me. In front of me, a group of students
were engaged in a panel discussion. Today's topic probed the
underlying social significance and potential ramifications
of one of last week's impossible homework problems; in
other words, how is it solved and will it be on the test?
To my left, two of my peers were playing verbal volleyball
with many of the words, phrases, and equations relevant to
the test material, I had no idea what they were talking
about and decided to quit listening before I did.
Lacking anything better to do, I began to fill out the
front of my bluebook. I did this very carefully because I
had noticed a definite correlation between the appearance
of the outside and the content within. Anyone need a
thesis topic?
Completing the short answer section consisting of name,
course, and date, I decided to go all out and write the
honor pledge. After doing so I was very pleased with
myself, for not only has I spelled both "received" and
"neither" correctly, but I had once again suppressed a latent
desire to write "I didn't cheat."
At precisely five minutes after the hour, the professor
entered the room carrying a stack of papers. He was a very
20
Michigan Technic


personable sort of fellow. In fact, at any other time, I
might have even considered him to be a nice guy. Under the
circumstances however, I felt justified in reserving him an
honorary position on my "Most Contemptable People of
All Time" list, right between my dentist and the quack
that gave me my swine flu shot — not the vaccine, the
disease. Without saying a word, the professor handed the
Papers to the first person in the first row and then left. I was
beginning to seriously doubt the laws of diffusion, when a
copy finally reached me.
Staring at the paper before me, I began to panic; it dealt
with material which was not to be covered on this exam.
Controlling my rage, I began to do what little I could. After
about two minutes, the professor re-entered the room
carrying another stack of papers. It was then that I
realized I now had a healthy start on next week's home-
work assignment.
After passing out the exam row by row, the professor
wrote his office location on the board, flashed an insidious
smile and, left.
The first problem was quite straightforward. To get the
answer all I needed to know was the Pythagorean theorem,
'be integral of cosine squared, and Issac Newton's birthdate.
Unfortunately, I didn't remember the last item and spent
considerable time deriving it from the other two. Eventually,
1 arrived at a reasonable answer.
'glanced at my watch and discovered that there was now
0nlY twenty minutes left in the exam. Transposing partial
answers from the bottom of one page to the top of the
ne*t had apparently taken longer than I had anticipated.
Currying on to problem two, I quickly constructed a
Ia9ram and formally set up the problem. After a consider-
able amount of plugging and chugging, more than the
average LS&amp;A student encounters even on a good weekend,
I obtained an imaginery negative quantity less then one.
Since my answer was to represent an area, I knew it-was not
rigorously correct. Going back over my work, I soon
discovered that the method of analysis I had used was only
valid on a blackboard.
Moving quickly to problem three, with only ten minutes
to go, my mind suddenly went blank. I had absolutely no
idea how to begin. After thinking slowly and carefully
for a full minute, I still couldn't do the problem, however
it suddenly struck me that the capital of Delaware was
Dover. I wrote this down both to clear my mind and for
partial credit. Gettin nowhere fast, I decided to make a
reasonable assumption which would simplify matters con-
siderably. I assumed problem four couldn't be as bad as
problem three.
With two minutes to go, I began problem four, and
discovered that my previous assumption was indeed invalid.
All was not lost however. I still had one last faint ray of
hope. Placing my feet together I closed my eyes. Slowly,
I began clicking my heels and repeating very softly "There's
no place like home." My faith in Hollywood was shaken a
bit, for I didn't end up on a farm in Kansas with a dog named
Toto. However I was spared further misery thanks to the
omnipotent three word phrase "Hand them in."
Trudging down the hallway feeling dejected, dismayed,
and dumbfounded, not to mention bewitched, bothered,
and bewildered, I was sure of one thing. Bluebooks did not
get their name from the way students feel after an exam.
For it that had been the case, they undoubtedly would be
brown.

Back?
by Steve Haynack
Back at school again. September = School. The one
equation that has always held true for as long as you
can remember.
How about last May, two weeks after you got out of
school, when you moaned and groaned that your summer
job (if you had one) was boring you to death? You couldn't
wait to get back to school, could you? And how you kept
yourself going all through the dull, dreary summer telling
yourself over and over you'd be back at school soon,
partying down with your friends and finally taking — no
choosing — interesting, relevant courses.
Well, here we are. You don't like it? What's that you
say about sour grapes?
Oh, I see. You never expected, you never even dreamed
your situation could be this bad. You found out that there's
no such thing as a 'cake' senior elective. That a design
course is not an easy four credit 'A'. Design means
putting together everything you've learned from those
basic courses like AM 211, Physics, and Mat-Met 250 • plus
some of that often-ignored, little-used imagination into
a reasonable, workable product. Hey, that's a lot of work.
Remember that Math course you dropped a couple
semesters back because you couldn't hack the professor?
No, you'd forgotten about that. Well, your program advisor
didn't. And you can't graduate on time in April until
you've fulfilled your requirements." That gives you
nineteen credits to take this term. Brand new, starting
this year, you pay extra for any number of credits over
eighteen.
Well, at least you can still party down with all your
friends, right?
Nope, no such luck. All your buddies are getting haircuts
and hitting the books to keep their grades up so that the
job recruiters will love them. Job? Wait a minute, a job?
You mean work?
Popping out of nowhere you hear words of wisdom
from relatives, friends, employers, and rock stars.
"You're a big boy now. Get out there and earn your
keep."
"Hey man, what're gonna do when you grow up?"
"Think of what you can do for the company, son."
"A working class hero is something to be, ..."
And Frank Zappa on why he keeps writing and playing
music, "Like what else are you gonna do, man. Work in
a gas station?"
You get two cents' worth from everybody every whioi
way.
So now you realize that you were foolish even to imagine
that your situation would stay the same. OK. So let's look it
your change of 'status' from the positive side.
Senior's Grade Point Average's are higher than other
student's. That's because after the three years of cruisin'
along as under classmen, the seniors finally woke up and
said, "I don't know anything. How can I do what I want
to do if I don't know anything?"
So you see things differently, huh? That's especially
evident when you watch the freshman and sophomores
become more familiar with the campus. Doing the same
things you did, for the same reasons.
Missing homework assignments, "I'll do two next week.
Pulling all-nighters before big exams. Yawning, "If'
could only figure this problem out ..."
Sleep-time in class exceeds class time awake. Zzzzz. ■ ■
A couple years back that was your head nodding.
You even landed a job as a student grader. A job with
limited power that's both a lot of time and fun. The
majority of the papers have the right idea, the right appro3*
to the problem. Which is reassuring. And if the students show
their work, that they're learning something, they'll get credit.
Don't you just love those snow jobs? The tricks youthought
you were the first to try had really been done many times
before. Like playing word games with definitions:
"Define viscous: 'A viscous material is one that is viscous.
Oh yeah? This is a middle level course, too. He'll get his.
And as to the future, you've got a fair chance for
either a decent job or graduate study.
Let's step back and look for a minute. So you came'0
Ann Arbor this fall with well-made plans, all thoughto"'
meticulously and far in advance. And these plans v«re
bent, folded, amd mutilated beyond all recognition- "e •
it wasn't the first time.
Hell, I guess I'll always be a freshman.

NAVY NUCLEAR PROPULSION.
THE FASTEST WAY UP IN NUCLEAR ENGINEERING.
If you want to get into nuclear
engineering, start by getting into
the Nuclear Navy.
The Navy operates more than
half the reactors in America. So
our nuclear training is the most
comprehensive you can get. You
start by earning your commission
as a Navy Officer. Then we give
you a year of advanced nuclear
technology, training that would
cost you thousands if you could
get it in graduate school. During
your career, you'll get practical,
hands-on experience with our
nuclear powered fleet. Maybe
you'll work on a nuclear subma-
rine, maybe a nuclear cruiser. But
wherever you work, you'll really
get to prove your worth-as a
young Nuclear Propulsion Officer
entrusted with the most advanced
technical equipment known to man.
If that sounds like the kind of
responsibility you're looking for,
speak to your Navy recruiter. He
can tell you if you qualify as a
Nuclear Propulsion Officer
Candidate. Or call toll free 800-841-
8000. (In Georgia,800-342-5855.)

IT'S NOT JUST A JOB, IT'S AN ADVENTURE.


50 Years Ago
Honor codes, it seems, are never without their contro-
versies. The most recent and well known incident is the
one at West Point. A few may even remember those
rumblings about our own Honor Code last Spring before
the West Point scandal broke. All of this is not new; an
interesting article dealing with the problems of honor codes
was published in the May 1926 issue of the Technic. The
article was written by then Assistant Professor A.D. Moore
who was the national president of Tau Beta Pi. He was doing
research on the various honor codes at schools around
the country and how well they were working.
Why have an honor system?" . . . once a school is
created, along with it is brought into being a system of
rewards and temptations," argued Prof. Moore. "Given
a school, there follows a group of young people striving
to pass courses; inevitably, the situation is more or less
conducive to cheating." When a system is set up which
strains the good qualities of human nature in the formative
periods of students' lives, his argument continued, it is
only fair that proper character building steps be taken. (One
must agree that the philosophy of the University regarding
its role in the students' lives has changed considerably over
the last 50 years.)
What makes an honor system work? Prof. Moore, suggests
that the emphasis should be placed on honor and integrity
not on the system. Failure-prone honor codes were quite
systematised. They had taken care of policing, reporting,
trials, convictions, and penalties. Unfortunately they did
not address themselves to instilling a sense of integrity.
A simple change of authority from faculty to student does
not make an honor system; honor must be given first
consideration not system.
Prof. Moore went on to explain where to place the
emphasis: Freshpersons should be told, "Be honorable . . .
you ought to be anyway; if you are not, learn how; we
want your respect; we will give you ours, if you earn it;
Incidentally, if you violate our trust the penalty issevere,
sure and quick." They should not be told "if you cheat, our
efficient honor committee will certainly throw you out of
school; every man will watch you closely, and you are
under suspicion until you get your reputation with us;
we insist on honesty and incidentally, we believe it pays
to be honest anyway." Then each freshperson is asked to
sign a pledge that it understands the honor code. This is
not a pledge that he won't cheat, just that it understands.
Prof. Moore also suggested that explanations appeal to
the students' sense of honesty. Peer pressure can be an
important aspect in a successful system; a favorable attitude

of the average student, expecially the upperclassmen, c
essential. Full support of the faculty cannot be ignorec
either.

The advertisements found in current publications sucr
as magazines provide a good barameter of public sentiment
and concern. For example, in reviewing the advertisemen:;
in the Technic over the past year, an emphasis of energy,
ecology, and quality of life issues can be seen. In the post *?
year of 1951 an emphasis of military /defense issues cants
seen. The red threat was very much alive in the minds of
people. Some examples follow.
Standard Oil ran an ad explaining how "used up" or
wells were being rejuvinated, which ended with the state
ment that "... research helps Standard Oil meet America's
vitally important civilian and preparedness needs." Excep;
for the military reference, the ad is exactly like those
being run today.
United States Steel ran an ad showing examples of the
many varied uses of steel. Two out of the five examples
were military oriented. Their motto: Helping build a better
America.
"Electron tubes with a military mind" boasts an ad for
RCA. "Electron tubes are the nerve ends of military in-
telligence," it continues, "So important is this area of
military intelligence that RCA Service field engineers have
lifted their efforts to new peaks." The ad goes on to explain
how they help the military.
An ad for Boeing offers graduating engineers the challenge
of working B-47s, B-52, and guided missiles, along with the
traditional benefits.
An Ad for Corning glass explains how one of their
products is involved in the operation of laying an artificial
fog with an airplane. Obviously this is a military operation-
The advertisements were not the only references to this
subject, many can be found in the "meat" of the magazine
A small piece about steel allocation in the U.S. noted that in
the opinion of a magazine called the Engineering News-
Record "There'll have to be a change in the thinking of
mobilization officials before highways get a larger (and much
needed) slice of the steel supply. Right now, government
officials don't seem to think highway modernization ana
reconstruction is essential to national defense - with few
exceptions."
Interestingly enough, a quick survey of last years adver-
tisements in the Technic shows that none of the ads men-
tioned anything military or defense related except ads run by
the armed services. Even the Army Corp of Engineers
emphasized their work involving the environment.

At some companies,
engineers run departments,
At Babcock&amp;Wilcox,
they run the company.
The challenge is clear-cut. If
you're a graduating engineer
looking for personal growth,
management responsibility
and the chance-to make a
major contribution early in
your career, what better place
to look than at Babcock &amp;
Wilcox, a company that's run
by engineers.
It's true. Many of B&amp;W's
top management people were
where you are now, not too
many years ago. And with the
opportunities B&amp;W offers for
engineers to become managers,
you could be in one of those
top positions not too many
years from now.
At B&amp;W you'll get involved
fast. As a major company man-
ufacturing urgently needed
high technology products for
power generation, energy con-
servation, pollution control
and related fields, there just
isn't time for B&amp;W to keep
bright young people waiting.
Babcock&amp;Wilcox is a
leading supplierof nuclearand
fossil-fuel steam systems, the
world's largest supplier of spe-
cialty steel tubular products
and ceramic fibers. And we're
a fast-growing force in compu-

Little known Presidential candidate Chevy Ollie is shown
above on his recent visit to the U of M campus. His
purpose in Ann Arbor was two-fold: While doing the usual
campaigning he was also in town to solicit the services of
the U of M marching band for his inaugural address. "If
Gus Hall can have them, I certainly deserve equal time,"
demanded Chevy. President Fleming was not available for
comment.
At his political rally Chevy boasted of his previous
experience, "Not only have I completed correspondence
courses in nuclear engineering and brain surgery, but I'm
also an experienced peanut picker. Besides, I can do things
none of the other candidates are capable of: I can walk,
chew gum, and not smile at the same time." During his stay

engineers who were
born to lead.
Are you the kind of engineer who has what it takes to move into management someday?
If you are, you already know it.
Now what you need to know is which companies can offer you the best oppor-
tunities. We think you'll find General Electric is one.
We're a high technology company. And that means we have to have manag-
ers who understand technology —women and men —to run the place.
Today, over 60% of the top managers at General Electric hold technical
degrees. In fact, over 65% of the college graduates we hired last year held
technical degrees.
Of course, just leadership ability and a technical degree won't get
you into management. First, you're going to need solid engineering
experience and a broad understanding of business.
And we have a lot of ways to help you get it.
One is our Manufacturing Management Program. A two-year
program of rotating assignments that gives you broad experience
with different products and manufacturing processes.
Another is our Engineering Program. For engineers with an
interest in product and systems design and development.
There's also a Field Engineering Program, a Technical Market-
ing Program, plus a number of programs sponsored by product
operations.
And all with just one aim. To give you all the responsi-
bility and all the perspective you need to move into man-
agement. As fast as you can manage it.
Of course, starting on a program isn't the only way
to make it into management at GE. If you have a
specific product interest, we have many direct-
placement opportunities that can get your career
started fast, too.
What kinds of product areas can you
work in at GE?
Maybe nuclear power. Or more
efficient turbine-generators. Or better
mass-transit systems. Or medical
equipment. Engineering plastics.
Cleaner, quieter jet engines. Communi-
cations products. You name it.

What For?
by Chuck Schatz
Since the Space Shuttle's inception in 1969, there have
been many questions from numerous sources concerning
the usefulness of a Shuttle. Questions arise constantly from
the "man-in-the-street", from politicians and social scien-
tists, as to why we need one at all. It's been called a
money-eating boondoggle, the military's secret weapon, a
waste of time, a competitor in the space race. The big
question people ask, "what do you do with?" is a
perfectly valid one, and this article will try to deal with
that.
In 1969, with the Apollo program on the wane,
aerospace engineers were ready to attempt a shuttle. The
technology from the earlier programs was developed enough
to design and implement a shuttle without as much re-
search and development as in the more intense Apollo
program. Preliminary groundwork had already been laid in
the 1950's with an experimental device (originally designed
for the Air Force by Boeing) called a "lifting body," the
forerunner of the Shuttle.
As government and private studies increased in number,
it became clear that the Shuttle was an excellent starting
point for the development of cost-effective space exploita-
tion. The cost savings implied by its large payload capacity
would make it the basic system for deployment of many
kinds of satellites and observatories, military or otherwise.
It could carry the largest satellites currently conceived, one
or more at a time, along with a scientific crew to keep a
close check (or repair, if necessary) on deployment.
Furthermore, it doesn't have to take up any payload at all,
and could pay for itself merely by retrieving or repairing
expensive special purpose satellites and orbiting laboratories.
Just on launch savings alone, the Air Force in 1971 said
it could phase out all of its current big launch rockets.
Against costs of $20 million to $35 million for each major
launch, a shuttle launch would run about $5 million. Cost
savings over Apollo missions were even greater, since they
needed long countdowns and assistance on recovery by the
Navy and Air Force. The Shuttle would have a countdown
of two or three hours and return on its own.
The Air Force is interested in the Shuttle to upkeep
its web of reconnaissance, communication, early-warrin
and other possible satellites. (Keep in mind that the A
Force is co-developing the Shuttle.) Until several years age
spy satellites had to be launched every two or three week
at a low orbit to get useable photographs. Using newer hig*-
resolution lenses, they can now stay up for two or thre
months, but it's still an expensive proposition. The higl
cost factor could be reduced considerably by using th
Shuttle to retrieve satellites before their orbits' decay, am
subsequently reusing them at another time or location
Maintenance of defensive recon and early warning satellite
can help deter major wars; the more the military know
about the other powers, the less prone they would probab
be to reckless actions.
Civilian uses for the Shuttle cover many areas of interest
especially those in the sciences that treat natural resources
Earth resource orbiting laboratories and satellites wouk
check for new resources of minerals, oil, coal, and geother
mal heat. Geological trouble spots such as earthquak
faults and volcanoes could be observed over a very large are
simultaneously. Agriculturalists could examine the healtl
of crops, and the degree of infestation by insects o
disease. Pollution control analysts could locate land heatin
or radiation, levels from possible accidents in nuclear powe
plants, or determine dissipation and motion characteristic
of smog in the atmosphere. Meteorologists could gain i
greater knowledge of weather patterns over the expanse
of ocean, where data is sketchy. Marine biologists couk
track key life and ocean current processes.
The potential for industrial exploitation of space is
enormous. It has become clear that we can't bend the
environment much more than it already is. In space, there
is no weather environment for machinery to contend with,
such as humidity or salt air, and very little gravitational
forces. This is particularly important for large-scale space
construction. Raw materials might be attained for that
construction by extraterrestrial mining of the Moon and
asteroids, while energy could be received from the sun and
converted directly for use in smelting processes. Zero
gravity is excellent for industrial processes that don't allow
Michigan Technic


ravitational influence such as large telescopic lense casting,
nd the manufacturing of very high precision ball bearings.
)ther functions of the Shuttle would include space-medicine
tudies of long-term weightlessness, such as might be en-
»untered on a manned Mars flight. Biochemists could
rtudy possible new classes of organic compounds found
n space, possibly even leading to new pharmaceuticals.
Electronics manufacturers could research new techniques
for growing semiconductor crystals.
The most persistant opposition to the Shuttle comes
surprisingly, from a group of scientists, mostly nuclear and
theoretical physicists, who have attacked manned space
'light as being too dangerous, expensive, and unproductive.
,n an article ("Machines, Not Man, Into Space," New York
Times magazine) an astrophysicist from Cornell University,
Dr. Thomas Gold, wrote that electronic automata and
unmanned satellites could do everything a manned shuttle/
station could do, and less expensively — an argument which
since has been contradicted by a cost analysis done by
Fortune magazine in 1970. Dr. Gold also concluded that
the possible delerious effects of extended weightlessness
was cause enough for the abandonment of space travel for
*e time being.
The Shuttle is designed for the first, most difficult task
°&gt; getting heavy loads into space, while being cost-competi-
tlve. Following it in development would be a Space Tug, a
Waller, strictly space-bound shuttle to be used for servicing
and/or deploying high-orbiting satellites, and for ferrying
men and supplies between the Moon and space stations to
be developed sometime in the near (10 to 15 years) future.
Nuclear powered spacecraft would eventually replace the
Tug for Moon trips and interplanetary trips, such as a Mars
voyage or asteroid investigations.
Aerospace people believe that cost-benefit analyses take
too little notice of one of the most important principles of
transportation: as transport becomes too frequent, faster,
and routine, it will attract more usage, lowering the cost of
operations. With a shuttle in operation, space stations,
manufacturing and observational platforms would be assem-
bled and maintained at a cost that is reasonable compared
to current methods of space transport.
But we must return to the question — why have a
shuttle at all. Isn't it just a luxury? The degree of interde-
pendence of the different disciplines of science (agriculture,
natural resources, weather, industry) in research dictates
much of the political, social, and economic structures of
countries all over the globe. The shuttle represents a
tremendous step forward, just in observational capabilities
alone, but would enable us to equitably attempt social
restructuring as a learning tool for astronomy, physics
(atomic and celestial) and space flight, the shuttle is a
key device for testing and development of other, larger
scale systems for use in space that could benefit us all
economically.

Conserving Energy?
by Bill Chomic
Ever since the oil embargo by the Arab oil cartel in 1974
a multitude of ideas and solutions have been proposed by
every imaginable interest group. Consumers have been
asked to do everything from limiting gasoline consumption
under threat of rationing to lowering the heating tempera-
ture of our homes. Other alternatives such as electric and
steam automobiles, solar heat, and wind energy have also
been presented. Granted all of these would definitely save
our alleged short supply of fossil fuels. (Whether there is
indeed a shortage of oil and natural gas is not the point of
this article. I will assume for the sake of discussion that
there is a shortage.) But are we headed in the right
direction or are all these efforts just stabs in the dark by
misguided agencies and advisors? In an article entitled "A
Technical Basis for Energy Conservation" by Charles A.
Berg, the Chief Engineer for the Federal Power Commission,
the efficient use of our energy resources is discussed as a
means of conservation. Presented here is a few ideas from
that article for the more efficient use of fossil fuels for
conservation and how they might possibly affect the
quality of life.
According to the. Stanford Research Institute, consump-
tion of energy falls into three basic categories. 1) The
operation of residential and commercial buildings, 2) The
processing of industrial materials, and 3) Transportation of
goods and people. The operation of residential and commer-
cial buildings uses about one-third of the fuel consumed
each year. The breakdown of this is presented in table 1.
When one segment of life requires one-third of our fuel
a closer look is warranted.
Space heating and water heating are by far the largest
fuel consumers. An improvement in efficiency in these areas
would undoubtedly produce significant reductions in fuel
consumption. Water heating is an area of special concern
Todays water heaters according to manufacturers specifica-
tions deliver a heat energy transfer ratio of 70%. If °ne IS
familiar with thermodynamics, this ratio of heat supplied
to useable output is good. This is the confusing fact; these
ratings are given for new equipment. In service a great deal
of dirt and mineral deposits are likely (more often than
not) to collect on the coil surfaces and reduce the efficien-
cy rating a great deal. Quite often to as low as 35%. It|S
clear that water heaters show a capability to waste more
fuel than some industrial processes which raise greater
objection.
Concerning space heating and gas type water heaters we
have a unique situation. At the present these processes are
performed by burning fossil fuels directly. These fues
burn at about 1000°C in an air environment. The heat
released is then used to heat various objects or spaces wrn
are at a much lower temperature. For example home heating
is usually maintained at 20°C, water heating at 60 C, a
cooking at 150°C. Often times, as with water heaters,!«
heat cannot be absorbed as quickly as it is released. Conse
quently a great deal of heat energy is vented to
surrounding atmosphere where it may not be *ant
In cooking, for example, the wasted energy is actua
greater than just that wasted at the range. This wasted he
must often be removed by an air conditioning SV"6
resulting in more wasted energy.
What kind of solution do we seek to correct
seemingly necessary waste? One thing that a few

A heat pump does exactly what it's name implies; it
moves heat from a source and transfers it to another
cation (a sink). An air conditioner is a heat pump, so is
refrigerator. They absorb heat from the inside and dump
outside. Notice that the heat source can be at a lower
smperature than the sink. In fact, a home can be heated
■\ the winter by removing heat from the outside and
'ringing it in — an air conditioner in reverse.
For home use, a system using ground water for the heat
ource has been proposed. Water is removed from the
jround and heat is drawn off by a heat pump. This heat
s used to heat the house or water. The unique advantage
Df this system is that the water, now very cool, can be
used for refrigeration and cooling. The only energy needed
is that to run the pumps. The ratio of fuel used for the
heat pump process to that used in conventional methods is
approximately 12%. This is clearly a savings of valuable
resources which can be used for processes that have no
alternatives other than direct use of fossil fuels. The
process can easily be adapted for many other domestic
uses.
Because of the temperature differences required to run
a heat pump efficiently and the limitations of our present
technology, the process becomes less efficient as the size
of the system increases, mandating an individual dwelling
basis of installation. This runs into the same problem that
solar energy and heating have encountered. For the project
to be useful as a means of saving fuel a large number of
users is necessary. This calls for a great number of conversions
which are both bothersome and costly to the individual.
In the area of material processing we run into two
large consumers of fossil fuel, a direct heating and steam
production (TABLE 1). There is a 70 - 80% waste in these
processes which is vented to the atmosphere, much to the
dismay of environmental groups. For example, a good deal
of metal and metal products require some heat treating and
air cooling. This results in a tremendous waste of energy
that could be put to use in various ways. One method used
by manufacturers of steel has been to use this heat to
pre-heat melts of metal or parts so that less energy is needed
to finish the process in the furnace. Presently we possess
the technology and the ideas to recover great amounts of
this wasted energy, but can we rearrange present produc-
tion schemes and plant layouts and still provide a useful
product at an economical price? The experts in this field
are few and far between. A great response from the technical
community is needed.
Transportation tends to be a redundant area in relation
to energy conservation. Most everyone recognizes that
burning a high grade fuel to propel an object over the
9round is wasteful in many respects. Steam propelled cars
have been suggested by many. Again as mentioned earlier
the heating of water tends to be an inefficient operation
'f done by direct fuel combustion. The effect of a dirty or
corroded steam generation plant in a car is to waste more
available energy than is needed for the process.
Electric cars have their disadvantages too. In converting
electrical to mechanical energy, they are more efficient.
However, one must consider the original power source
used to charge the batteries. Most likely it was a fossil
fuel burning power plant. There is still no savings of
fossil fuels. On top of that, there are losses in trans-
mission and the storage batteries.
One bright spot appears to be hydrogen as a fuel source.
Several reasons support this. First is the abundance which
is limitless, if one considers dissociation of water. Secondly
hydrogen costs less to transport to the point of consump-
tion than other fuels per energy unit. Third, hydrogen
burns more completely and cleaner than conventional
fuels. Thus there is less fuel being blown out of the system
as pollutants. For the near future our best course seems to
be using existing technology to upgrade present engines to a
greater efficiency, conservation by the individual (always
painful), and better and expanded mass transit systems.
Because of the inconvenience put on the individual by
these they become difficult to implement, as we have
already seen by the disregard for the 55 m.p.h. speed
limit.
A final note: heating processes, cooling processes, and
engines all waste a large amount of energy. In the case of
refrigeration units which use a throttling value, a great deal
of energy is wasted. By replacing this valve, with a more
expensive part the efficiency increases greatly. But the
consumer is not willing to pay for these improvements.
The same is true for most other energy consuming equip-
ment. The relation between initial cost and operational
costs down the road is shown in Table II. Generally the
more expensive units are more efficient, but the consumer
so often sees only his initial outlay because the other
savings are so gradual in nature. Another area of concern
is in the design of various energy consuming equipment.
Refrigeration equipment for example has a 20% excess
power consumption designed into it so that there will
never be a deficiency of power. This type of thing needs
to be controlled more carefully.
Obviously a great deal of work needs to be done
towards energy conservation. This means a greater response
by the technical community. And if what we read is
correct concerning the amounts of fossil fuels we have left,
the sooner the better.

A Short Story by A. Stephen Toby
Part II
The ship's computer informed the bridge that the anchor
was secured dripping at the bows through a panel of dials
and flashing lights. The Fleet Admiral stood on the wing of
the bridge while the orders flew through the wires from
captain to computer to engines and helm-nozzles. Slowly
the great ship turned, ever so gradually she gathered way,
and the water gleamed white at her bows and under her
counter. Just as she passed the sandspit at the entrance to
the harbor, her flag rose to her main gaff and floated there,
translucent, shining in the sunlight, and the whole ship
seemed ennobled by the gleam of silk and golden thread.
And the bow-wave rose to throw shining spray in the deck,
and then flattened again as the ship reached cruising speed,
and the Tanzanian coast sank away in utter silence beyond
the horizon. And the flagship was alone again on the
glittering sea under thesky,steaming north towards Mombasa.
The first test of the United Nations Navy came at dawn
the next day, before Jarvis and his ship were quite ready
for it. It came in the form of a bell clanging through the
ship's PA system just before sunrise, and an officer shouting
through the admiral's door that aircraft in large numbers
were approaching the ship. It came as Jarvis ran out onto the
wing of the bridge, buttoning his shirt with one hand and
pointing his binoculars with the other. On the wing of the
bridge was a two-way intercom, a device that could transmit
and receive simultaneously. The intercom informed the
admiral that the planes had not responded to radio warnings.
"Engage inner Skyshield," he said. A casemate on the after
superstructure swung round to point off to starboard; four
armored scuttles swung open for an instant, and in a flash
of golden smoke four long, slim missiles went screaming
off into the darkness with such speed that they were
above and beyond sight long before the smoke had faded
and the scuttles had snapped shut.
Jarvis blinked. The image of the missiles leaping from
their launcher had not even faded from his eyes sufficiently
for him to see the intercom when it announced, "Three
hits registered and confirmed. Three planes destroyed.
Contact with fourth missile lost." Four more missiles
gleamed, dully now in the broadening day, and were gone.
This time the admiral heard the account from the BCR,
which was recorded on tape for the log as it came in:
"Four missiles registered and tracking on R and I. Enemy
launching decoys. Missiles still tracking. Enemy evasive
maneuvers. Missiles homing. Four hits registered ..."
Another salvo of missiles lanced out into the golden
morning, cutting off the last words of the missile-guidance
account.
And so it went through the morning. Salvo after sate
of the small Standard Twos thundered away in the goWer
sunlight. It was a lovely day. The sun was warm, but a
fresh breeze drew whitecapsfrom the sea. And missile ah?
missile scored its path on the boundless, crystalline air in
snow and fire, and drowned the rushing sound of the stern
wave with sonic booms. And not a target could be seen
the flagship seemed to be spending her weapons on an
empty sea. The sun was soon well above the horizon, and
it occurred to the admiral that no missiles had been fired
for some time. In response to his question the intercom
informed him that the enemy had retired from the sky,
but that a vessel was in sight by radar. Shortly afterwards
the formal announcement, "Ennemie en vue," reached th»
admiral as he hurriedly ate a belated breakfast in the ward
room.
A few of the small Standard Twos were fired by the
enemy a little before noon. Jarvis saw one reach thetopof
its trajectory and begin to descend towards him. Then one
of "Valinor's" missiles flashed upward like a huge needle,
too quick for mortal sight; and when the slow descent of
the enemy's weapon had not quite reached the golden trail
oftheflagship'sdefense.aflowerof gold budded and bloomed
and withered in the sky in a few moments. And still the
"Valinor" glided onward, effortless, tireless, on the same
immutable course; her wake lay behind her like a train of
lace, straight as a beam of light. There was something that
turned the admiral's stomach in this, this cold, indifferent,
enormous machine that did not even change her course as
she shrugged off the attacks of an enemy that Jan"S
knew to be brave, determined, and in every way worthy of
a serious engagement. But still the ship plunged on under the
sunlight, superior, calculating, inhuman. And the worst of it
was that the ship's computer was absolutely right- The
battle, when it came, would not be a battle at all, but a
massacre.
It was standard procedure in the UN Navy for Admiral
Jarvis to remain in the BCR with most of the ship's officers
during an engagement. But on this day the Battle Command
Room seemed too small, the armor plate and depth below
the waterline which made it safe seemed to impriso"
rather than protect the admiral. Jarvis had had lunch on the
navigation bridge and had afterwards resumed his station
on the exposed starboard wing. The enemy was reported to
be slowly closing the "Valinor" from ahead and to starboard.
The admiral paced back and forth across to the forebridge
and back. He could not understand why the enemy.

the UN Fleet Admiral knew what was going on. It was
: possible for his opponent to defeat him; the battle was
&gt; unequal. In fact, unless the Dutch admiral had been
ssed by incredible luck, no organized battle was possible
all, for the simple reason that "Valinor" had a full
enty knots' superiority in speed over Doorman's three
avy ships. Doorman knew that he could not win; he also
lew that Jarvis would try to intercept the Kenyan trans-
its as they left Mombasa, which in fact was exactly
hat the flagship was now doing. Jarvis saw that Doorman
as only fighting delaying-actions so that the Dutch
imiral and the Chinese fleet could come to the aid of the
ansports and cover their advance against "Valinor's"
ventual appearance. So Doorman had selected a goal that
e had some chance of attaining; after all, it was unlikely
hat any ship could beat off attack after attack without
naneuvering in such a way as to hinder her progress. It was
vith awe and dismay that Jarvis contemplated the obvious
act that the "Valinor's" computer already knew this, and
was acting upon it. On speed rested his chance to beat back
the Kenyan invasion, and the computer was steering his
ship straight and true in the right direction, never wavering,
never stowing down for a moment, and perfunctorily beating
off attacks that could have been eluded or overwhelmed
by an officer with a tactical turn of mind.
Hard on the heels of this revelation came an even more
painful one: the computer would not take the time to
circle around the ship now sailing to engage his vessel. The
flagship would steam straighton. And even if the enemy was
his old command, she would be engaged and probably
destroyed. For a moment the desperate thought of
overriding the computer and ordering "Valinor" to avoid
action nagged at the Fleet Admiral. Then, his mind seemed
clearer. He would engage the enemy, because he knew that
it was what he must do. Otherwise the UNN would fail and
the world would be doomed to war again: in fact. Doorman
would be vindicated. His duty might be painful, but it was
clear and inescapable. Suddenly it came to him in the voice
of the Tanzanian ambassador "You will never be pure again."
"De Zeven Provincien" appeared within the circle of
Admiral Jarvis's binoculars fine off the starboard bow. The
cruiser turned broadside to her enormous opponent. To the
admiral, the cruiser was just as she had been when he had
known her, a handsome, well-balanced ship of World War
"design, painted dull grey all over. The replacement of her
after guns with Terrier (later Standard Two) surface-to-air
missiles, with the cooperation of the US Navy, had harmed
both her appearance and speed, although very slightly.
Jarvis had not known her in her original form, as he had v
been only two years old at the time of her first reconstruc-
tion. The reason for the retention of such an old ship
in the Royal Netherlands Navy was that, as planning for
the UNN advanced, nations became more and more
reluctant to spend money on warships whose function
would soon be taken over by a more efficient international
agency.
The Dutch cruiser's bow wave curved huge and menacing
from her cutwater to her forward turrets, dazzling white
against the gray hull. Spray swirled about her in the wind,
blurring the well-remembered silhouette like the smoke of
battle, or the mists of time. Her sternwave was even larger
than its counterpart up forward; it towered well above her
taffrail, its silvery edge just touching the ship's stern.
Black smoke poured from "De Zeven Provincien's" two
funnels, as she steamed at maximum speed to cross "Valinor's"
bows. And still the huge white flagship sped on without
taking any action, and the shining flag rippled easily in the
wind. Jarvis estimated the range at less than six sea miles; a
Standard Two could still be used, beam-guided from the
ship, but the computer made no attempt to do so.
As Jarvis watched, "De Zeven Provincien" slowed, her
bow-wave shrinking to a tiny glint of white at her fore-
foot, and the great mass of foam behind overtaking her as it
shrank away to nothing. Her forward turrets, six-inch
twins (vintage 1953), swung slowly around until they
pointed at "Valinor." Orange smoke edged in white and
gold leaped from the gun-muzzles, shrouding the bridge and
foremast; the sound came to Jarvis sharp and high down the
featureless swells of the years, and he put his head in his
hands so that he would not see the proud old ship roll in a
graceful sweep with the recoil of the guns. A louder, nearer
report made him look up through his tears just in time to
see the second shell strike his ship. Full on the armored
casemate for the tactical surface-to-surface missiles it
struck with a ringing blow and a dull red flash; shrapnel
spattered the teak sheathing of the steel deck, dust and
smoke spread and rose to be swept away on the wind.
The stroke had been dealt in the ancient way with
millimetric accuracy, but to no avail: the steel plating
of the casemate, two feet thick, had not even been scratched.
And the battle-ensign floated high like the sun on the sea,
blue trimmed in gold, invincible by might of mortal arms.
The flagship plunged on, towards the cruiser stopped now
in her path. The old ship blazed away with her little
popguns at point-blank range, without hope, without fear.
Jarvis was in the midst of a nightmare. It was as if,
having struggled to pick up a heavy broadsword with which
to strike some fancied enemy, he had found the weapon
moving forward of its own accord. Now that his only
wish was to spare this old ship, the silvery sword of his
flagship was speeding forth on a course he felt powerless
to change. And "De Zeven Provincien," faithful beyond
measure, would make no attempt to escape, "Valinor"
struck Jarvis's former command just forward of No. 2
funnel. The flagship's bows sliced through armor plate,
steel girders, fuel tanks and boiler room, like a knife through
cheese. The nuclear turbines never even missed a beat as the
upper part of the sonar dome struck the cruiser's heavily
reinforced steel keelson. The huge structural member bent
and twisted like cheap tin, folded up around "Valinor's"

flagship sped through the second half of her opponent and
sailed on into the sunlit day. She had split a 12,000 ton
cruiser in half and Admiral Jarvis had felt nothing, heard
nothing of the old ship's passing. The severed halves of the
Dutch cruiser flashed by, one on either side. And the UNN
battle standard fluttered unconcerned in the wind, sunlight
on the sea.
And then Jarvis intervened. The "Valinor" swept round
in a circle surprisingly small for such a large ship. Her
engines thrust shining water forward along her sides, and
she glided to a stop. Davits swung out over the water and
boats were lowered. They sped off towards the cruiser's
stern, floating amidst an oil-slick a little to the south.
"Valinor" had come alongside the bow section. Rope
ladders snaked down into the shining air. The last survivor
to come aboard the flagship from "De Zeven Provincien"
was Vice-Admiral Doorman. And meanwhile, Kenyans,
Chinese, and Dutch were gathering for battle beyond the
horizon, off Mombasa.
"Here is my sword, sir," said Doorman. He approached
Jarvis on the wing of the bridge.
"Keep it," said Jarvis. "Much honor have you gained,
and now you are relieved of your obligations, as you no
longer have power to fulfill them. You did what you could;
but you were doomed from the beginning. For history,
once set in motion, has a power and momentum all its
own. The hopes of many men rush forward towards
fulfillment, and no single lord has the strength to stop
them. Even so, if these hopes are evil, men of honor every-
where must resist with all their strength, even without
hope of victory; by such methods has victory come in the
past. But here, you have set yourself up against a hope
more universal than any, perhaps, in the past, and less
evil. Ever since the last world war, this hope has grown
among men, and each of many, myself included, furthered
it in his own way. Now is your time. Redeem your word,
join me, and seek to consummate the hope, for it is good."
Doorman followed the admiral's gaze to the flag,
floating high at the mainmast, azure against azure, mortal
thought reaching outward to the eternal sky from the
eternal sea. "As I promised, so shall I do. But I do not
agree that history is as you say. It does not start to move,
then use us as blind instruments as you seem to imply. Men
begin it, and if enough men are dissatisfied with its course,
they end it and set a new direction for it. Was it not one man
who thought of the UNN?"
"Aye, that was true of the UNN, and of all things in
their beginnings. But if the course of prior history had not
been implying a need for such an organization for a long
time, no one would have listened to Talbot. Even so, as
you remember, nothing might have happened were it not
for the Greek crisis in 1983 throwing a scare into everyone."
"Quite right," said Doorman. "But that does not prove
that history is the master; it only shows that a man's
accomplishments are limited by his times. This is no surprise
to me, and it does not change one's responsibility for one's
acts; for the truly great accomplishments have worth inde-
pendent of their times."
"That may be," said Jarvis. He stared at the wreck of
the cruiser, abandoned now and sinking. "Yet behold^
results of opposing the thrust of history."
"You regret her passing, sir? I do not. The ships n
build are much like man himself. They too are mor*
products of a particular tradition at a particular time.Thq
too are obliged to do what their tradition asks of them.^
they too can act beyond their traditions to benefit rro»
people in the future. And in a time when it is not 9m
to men to be sure which choice is right in the long view.a
use tradition as a guide is legitimate. History is one; j
worked once at least before; if the opposing admirals cannot
see all sides of the gem of Truth before battle, is each not
obliged to follow the truth he knows? That is what I did
And still I am not certain. Who knows what the UNN will
become, fifty years hence? You may yet live to regret its
founding.
"How can you, or anyone, mourn dead men of a wrecked
ship? Men and warships pass away into the silence of the
years, storm-tossed or battle-torn, or live beyond their time
to be broken up for scrap, or die in bed. Afterwards, whs:
remains? Though flesh and steel will rot and rust, mortal
men can still win honor that will last forever. That ship's
act, now safe in the past, is part of the present. Maybe men
will remember it, maybe not. Maybe it was right; who will
ever be able to tell if freedom or order is the greater ideal'
But whatever the wise may say in the future, that ship's
gesture is everlastingly to her credit, for it was made with
faith and courage on behalf of a cause that seemed the best
available. Even if no one praises this deed, does that make it
any the less worthy?"
The flagship gathered speed again and resumed her
northerly course. As she advanced the weather began to
deteriorate. A cold wind arose in the east and blew clouds
across the sun. The battle-ensign snapped furiously at the
halyards; the sky grew blankly overcast with high white
clouds that swirled and writhed with the wind. And the sea
grew gray, and the flag seemed the only blue thing left
upon earth. White as the sky, the ship plunged on into the
afternoon. And the admirals agreed that the teak deck, a
reflection of life in its delicate shade, looked out of place mi
the colorlessness of the world.
It was 1500 hours, after Jarvis's late and flavorless lunch
on the navigation bridge, when a peculiar apparition was
sighted. It had approached from ahead in a curious zigza99in9
course at a slow speed. The computers could not classify it
with certainty, but, as it made no hostile maneuvers, Jaw*
chose to ignore it. This decision was the cause of some satis-
faction for the admiral, as the computer could give him no
assistance. The apparition came into sight as a white triangle
on the horizon. In the admiral's binoculars it finally resolved
itself into a low sailing yacht with one aluminum mast
gleaming dully under the clouds. She was close-hauled,
Jarvis could see her red underbody through rifts in ,ne
spray that swept up from her bows and almost hid her
hull. She had long, slim overhangs at either end. On net
mainsail near the top the admiral finally succeeded.in
reading the letter "M" despite her pitching. As "Valine
swept silently past Jarvis glimpsed men running across her
deck as she tacked. Then she heeled over to the other side,
and Jarvis saw the helmsman wave at the speeding vwarshiP-

Michigan Technic


ire was an M-class, Universal Rule sloop, probably dating
jm the 193O's. She carried no cargo, no passengers, and
i weapons; even by sailing ship standards she was slow;
e had cost a fortune to build and had earned nothing in
!r entire sixty-year career. This yacht was a plaything for
le rich while the poor were starving. But somehow the sight
f her brought the admiral such joy as he had not known
&gt;r a long time. For as long as such a thing could exist,
ope shall remain; and this sloop's right to sail the seas was
uaranteed by the UN Board of Admiralty. And so it
wuld be forever, if Admiral Jarvis had anything to say
bout it; and even though he himself was shut up in the
nnpregnable prison of his own making, such echoes of his
lays of freedom would remain to cheer him. So he turned
[gain to his task with an easier mind, because the yacht that
lid good to no one need justify her existence to no power
&gt;n earth. And the "Valinor" sped past into a deepening
iarkness, a cloud ceiling creeping downwards from the sky
ind inwards from the horizon, and the sloop vanished in
distance.
Some time later the "Valinor" was still steaming north,
laminated in dark gray, the sea below, the sky above. Like a
butterfly embalmed in amber, she alone kept the colors of
life in the gloom of the days. A large ship had been detected
onradar. She responded to "Valinor's" radioed challenge with
the proper recognition signal for a UNN vessel. Then, at first
dimly through the mist, a low white ship appeared. Like
"Valinor", she had a white hull and teak-sheathed decks;
but her missile launchers, instead of being flush-deck,
armored devices, stood in plain sight on her upper deck.
She had two Standard Two/Asroc dual-purpose twins, one
forward and one aft of the superstructure. A Russian-built
tactical surface-to-surface single launcher stood on the
superstructure between the two towering black airfoil
masts. Huge radar antennae at the mastheads gleamed
weirdly in the dim mockery of sunlight; they were made of
stainless steel, and gave this vessel, nuclear-powered through
twin water jets, an incredibly accurate and long-range radar
capability. Thence came her name, "Palantir," the Far-
Seeing. "Palantir" was a huge 1,000-foot aluminum destroyer
of scarcely 20,000 tons displacement. Her water-jets
squirted their spray into the air through small ports in
the stern above the waterline. Because of her exquisite
clipper lines and powerful engines she was capable of well
over hull speed; indeed, it was said in the UNN that she had
made seventy knots on her trials, so confounding her cap-
tain that she overran the measured mile and smashed her
sonar dome on a sandbar before he could stop or turn her,
and had to be towed home for a refit. Of course one
should not put too much stock in the tales sailors tell
about their ships, but as Jarvis watched her overhaul his
s"ip briskly and pull out in front, trailing a ghostly plume
of spray behind her, he could well believe in this one. The
way she slipped through the water could confound any
officer. "Palantir" took up station somewhat ahead of
Valinor", and soon four ghostly hydrofoils appeared, two
on each side of the flagship, and held station there, sound-
In9 the depths with their sonars. These small, fast vessels
Wr* armed only with antisubmarine torpedoes and the
'ittle "Slingshot" surf ace-to-air missile. They were essentially
antisubmarine warships, using the forty-pound Slingshot only
for defense.
Although it was as yet only early evening, and should
have been broad daylight, dusk appeared to have come.
The wind, too, had risen to well over forty knots. The
swell came from the starboard bow, now laced with
whitecaps and streaked with flying spray. Jarvis could see
that the swell was much worse than before, because the
"Palantir" was now rolling heavily, her masts sweeping out
wide arcs; her main radar antennae, and the smaller ones
lower on the masts, were now flickering intermittently
with light, like jewels. But "Valinor" sped onward unshaken,
on an even keel, for no storm of this planet could do her
harm. First among ships, she bore the Rings of Power,
that no wind could stir, nor rain wash out, nor wave sweep
away from the position chosen for them. It began to rain,
and the forms of the ships grew blurred, and the squadron
sped onward, white wraiths in the grayness. And it seemed
to Jarvis that no light would ever return to the world.
And then the flagship sped out of the rain, as it parted
for her like fog before the wind. And ahead the "Palantir"
glowed and sparkled, sharp and clear in the rain-washed
air. From her port spreader on the mainmast, below the
shining radar antenna that crowned it, a hoist of signal
flags was flying. The admiral stared at the flags snapping
bright and gay in the grayness, as flags have done for time
without measure, sending their message to all with eyes to
see: "Enemy in sight." The flags then sank swiftly out of
sight and were replaced by another hoist soaring up to
take their place: "Enemy in sight to windward." The
intercom crackled into life at Jarvis's post on the bridge,
informing him that "Palantir" had detected a large fleet
closing from ahead. "Estimate aircraft carrier, cruiser and
large numbers of destroyers and smaller craft. "Palantir"
also reports subs detected at long range."
It must, Jarvis thought, be the united Chinese and Dutch
fleets, as yet far beyond the edge of sight, but closing fast.
"General signal," he spoke into the intercom. "Alter course
to Two Eight Zero." Signal flags rode to "Valinor's"
foremast spreaders, furled within their halyards, then were
poured free upon the wind. And aboard the "Palantir" the
battle-ensign dipped slowly in response, then rose again to
the gaff, whipped out hard and tense in the wind. "Execute,"
said Jarvis. "Palantir" sliced round in a high-speed turn, spray
flying across her deck and sweeping through her rigging like
a veil of silver lace. She made a splendid picture, heeled
well over with the force of her speed, sparkling in the thin
light, slim and frail and lovely. And the hydrofoils and
"Valinor" followed round in her wake, presenting their
broadsides to the approaching enemy.
And the intercom spoke: "Signal from ambassador at
Dar es Salaam, "Invasion force entering Rhodesia. Engage-
ments reported. Recommend immediate action.' End mess-
age. Computer recommends destruction of enemy fleet
immediately, then token attack on Dar es Salaam." That
seemed indeed a good course of action, so Jarvis decided
to carry it out.
"Tactical Offense Ring, stand by," said the admiral.
"Engage automatic guidance on enemy fleet. Have compu-
ter control destroy all vessels in order of offensive rating,
directing guidance independently of BCR."

guidance engaged on enemy carrier. Ready to open fire."
"Open fire," said the admiral. The gray steel casemates
rotated slowly, like turntables set flush with the deck,
until the foremost and aftermost casemates (the only ones
belonging to the Tactical Offense Ring) pointed off to star-
board. The scuttles swung up, revealing that in fact they
were both scuttles and launchers, for each held a missile
underneath it, ready to fire. These missiles had been
waiting in ready position, almost at deck level, cradled
under the armored scuttles. Then a burst of lovely golden
flame lit up the gray world like the returning sun, beating
back the edge and roof of darkness, reflecting with eerie
silver brilliance from "Palantir's" radar antennae. The
missiles themselves had faded to a dim afterglow in the
gray clouds before the wind swept the mantles of gold from
above the decks of the speeding flagship. After the warmth
and light had faded, although Jarvis knew the destroyer
was still keeping station about a half a mile ahead, she was
lost to sight. He found this most disheartening; the re-
splendent white ship had been a great comfort to him,
reflecting bright memories, beauty that was complete of
itself. And then the flagship fired another brace of missiles,
and another, and another, and the battle dragged on and on.
But with each broadside of the computer-guided weapons
the darkness drew back, and the "Palantir" glimmered back
into view. And each time the light faded, the darkness
seemed thicker and closer and lower, and weighed heavier
on the admiral's mind.
The two great ships (the hydrofoils had faded from sight)
altered course several times during the battle. While
"Palantir's" radar and infrared sensors kept the flagship's
computer informed on damage done to the enemy,
missiles continued in a steady stream from "Valinor's"'
casemates. Finally, the glare of one set of missiles faded
away and was not renewed, and a voice in the gray mist
told the admiral that no enemies were left on the surface.
The admiral asked where the hydrofoils were, and after a
short pause the voice replied that they were about fifty
miles south of the flagship, having evidently missed one of
the turn signals. The admiral ordered the voice to transmit
a radio order to the hydrofoils which would send them to
destroy the enemy's submarines, if they could be found; and
he added that another message should be sent to the am-
bassador in Dar es Salaam. "Say'Get under cover. Intend
to destroy presidential palace.' End message." The admiral
fell silent. He had already given the orders for the attack
on Dar es Salaam; although "Valinor" was to launch the
single missile as soon as she came into range, "Palantir"
would be sent ahead to a position from which the pinpoint
accuracy of her sensors could be used to guide the missile
in its descending trajectory. A direct hit in Mbwerere's
office, the admiral thought, with one of the tactical missiles,
would convince the Tanzanians that it was best to abandon
the war, and make a nuclear attack unnecessary.
Although it was not yet sunset, it was fairly dark. It
was not black as night, but a sort of dark gray, an emptiness
into which "Palantir" had long disappeared. It therefore
made no apparent difference that the destroyer was now
heading for Dar es Salaam at over sixty knots, and would
soon be out of sight even in perfect weather. It did make
a difference that the flagship was now steering soirhj
southeast; the wind was behind her and Jarvis oa.i
unzip his windbreaker. The flag now rippled easily in n
grayness, relieved of most of the weight of the apparrt
wind, and a low hum replaced the whistle from the rigginc.
The thin gray mist that had been closing in around "Valine'
all afternoon was thicker than ever; it was becom x
difficult to see the jackstaff from the wing of the bridge
where the admiral now lay in a deck chair. Further, a to*
fog of spray now lay over the sea's surface, swirling or
tinuously in the wind. And the roof of cloud had droop*:
lower and darker. It was a dim, shrinking bubble of a work
featureless gray dome above shading down to a featured
white floor. The living sky and sea were gone, and event's
300,000-ton ship was beginning to look less solid.
When the missile was finally fired after untold eternities
of steaming through the void, its brilliant orange vapor-
cleared the mists away for a moment. An eruption of light
swirled upwards, and the admiral felt its warmth on hs
face. The clouds seemed to recede upwards before the
blow, and when the wind swept the glowing veil away
Jarvis could see the jackstaff clearly, like an upraised
finger at the end of the long foredeck; beyond, he
caught a glimpse of a gray wave laced with white
Then the grayness closed in again, and the ship slowed unt;
she barely had steerageway. The mist was now swirling past
the ship with some speed towards Dar es Salaam. Jarvis
laced on his foul-weather hood. It was getting quite coid
and damp, and darker. The admiral watched the mists
go sweeping by, and for a long time he stared fixedly as if
mesmerized by the sight.
Then a voice said, quite loudly, "Messages. From
'Palantir': Missile hit on target 1920 hours. This vesse
attacked by submarine 1927. Vessel not damaged. Out-
maneuvered and finally sank submarine by Asroc. Rescued
five Chinese survivors. End message. From ambassador, Dar
es Salaam: 'Attack complete success. Broken glass and
rubble scattered all over town. Mbwerere says armies re-
treating and war over for his part, but late report has most
of Rhodesia in revolution. Naval Intelligence claims massacres
taking place. Refugees now in South Africa say same.
Mbwerere says can't fight progress. I suspect however that
Board of Admiralty will concur with me in congratulating
you. External tampering eliminated; problem is internal
now and out of your line.' End message."
The admiral closed his eyes and thought he saw loops
drawn on blue paper. Suddenly the circles swung upright
and started rolling and he imagined himself chasing them.
He ran as fast as he could, but somehow they always rolled
just a little faster. It was very important that he catch them,
so he jumped, arms outstretched — and then found himself
lying in his deck chair with a cold wind blowing damp mist
into his face. He must have fallen asleep. He still couldn't
see for a moment, even after he had opened his eyes.
Then he knew why. "Et nox facta est." He had carried
out the duty appointed to him, struck the blows that
could be struck, guided by the wisdom gathered slowly by
many men over long epochs. And there had been mobilized
a great fleet, and with it war was driven back into the
shadows. And then, there was night, and cold wind and
rain, and many ships scattered in the darkness.

President Ford recently resurrected a committee called
the White House Office of Science and Technology. The
committee consists of a group of engineers and scientists
who advise the President directly on matters of scientific
importance such as energy, agriculture, the environment,
the economy, and the use of resources. It is important
because the President needs a ready reliable source of
scientific information much in the same way that he needs
economic and political information.
The White House Office of Science and Technology had
its beginnings as a science advisory board in the early
sixties. The trend for.such a committee began at the end of
World War II. During the fifties, in the wake of the "red
scares," a good knowledge of science and technology
seemed vital to the nation's survival. Fear of Soviet
technological supremacy put the first organized scientific
committee with direct access to the President in the White
House. It was called the President's Science Advisory
Committee and was instated in 1957, following the
Soviet Union's Sputnik Launches. The committee continued
to gain importance and in 1962, the President's Science
Advisory Committee was expanded into the Office of
Science and Technology. The expansion came a year after
the Soviet Union put the first man in orbit and was again
precipitated by the fear that the Soviets were becoming
more scientifically advanced.
The committee continued through the sixties and into
the seventies, although it appeared to be losing some of
its former importance. In early 1973, Richard Nixon
eliminated the program in efforts to cut back federal
spending. The duties of the committee were to be absorbec
by the larger National Science Foundation, and there would
no longer be a scientific group with direct access to tte
President. The scientific community raised vigorous oo
jections to the elimination, and it was thought by man,
that the office was done away with because many of tf*
scientists disagreed with Nixon on issues such as ttw
Vietnam war.
When Ford took over as President, he immediate1)
expressed interest in re-establishing the defunct committee,
A bill was drafted for this purpose and was passed by the
House in November 1975. After a few revisions, it was
passed by the Senate in April 1976. In early May 1976.
President Ford signed the committee into existence again.
Upon signing the bill, he said the White House doors were
again open "to draw on the knowledge and expertise of
our scientific and technical experts."* The new committee
consists of a director, four associate directors, and a staff
of 15. It was allotted a budget of S3 million for the fiscal
year 1977.
One of the interesting aspects proposed for the committee
was the idea of a "science court." A debatable issue could
be brought before a panel of impartial judges and both sides
presented, similar to a court of law. The judges would sort
out what was presented and submit a report to Congress.
This was proposed for issues in which a government body
would need a clear-cut statement of scientific facts.
The first step in deciding an issue would be to pick a topic
and a panel of judges. Topics such as pesticides, drug safety,
fluoridation of water, fluorocarbons, and nuclear reactor
safety are possible topics. There would be two opposing
sides, and each would prepare a list of factual statements
of their opinion to be read. The opposing side would then
either accept or challenge each statement. The judges would
weigh the statements and the arguments and, from them,
publish a report on their conclusions.
Opponents of the court idea say it would be costly to
implement, many cases contain conflicting evidence, and
there is the possibility of the judges not being impartial in
their reports. There is also concern that science would
become automatized with no room for value judgments.
An example of this would be a case concerning the use of
pesticides. The pesticide DDT was used for many years to
control malaria, encephalitis, and other mosquito-borne
diseases. On the island of Ceylon there were 80,000
deaths due to malaria in 1934-35. In 1963, after the use of
DDT to control mosquitoes, there were 17. When the use
of DDT was discontinued in the late sixties, over 60,000
cases of malaria were reported in 1968-69.^ The toxicity of
DDT could be proven, but was it more important to saw
animals or human lives? Who is to decide such things?
Questions such as these involve value judgments. These
would be unresolvable in a "science court."

Michigan Technic


Years Ago
Looking through the old Technics I run across many
all items which are amusing, and revealing of the times,
t about which there is not much to say.
For instance, in the May 1926 Technic there appeared
article outlining the city plan for Detroit. It was quite
jcific about how the streets were to run and how they
juld be constructed. The main thoroughfares were to have
ass rail transportation down the center, lanes for high
eed automobile traffic on either side of the railroad, and
ten lanes for local traffic on the outer most edges. It is
iteresting to note that the roads now appear where the
ity plan called for them; and in many areas the lanes for
seal traffic still appear next to the high speed lanes; but
telroit still does not have a mass transit system.
Lost Panacea: What building material held the promise
tf solving all of our housing problems in 1926. Rammed
earth you say? That's correct. Rammed earth is just that.
Forms are put up for the walls and then clay dug up
during excavation is used to fill the forms. Air hammers
are then used to pound the clay solid. The first record of
this type of construction is dated about 50AD. At the time
the record was made the structure had been standing for
280 years. Its advantages are: low materials and trans-
portation costs, hardness increases with age, resists wrecking,
and can be easily painted. I wouldn't want to be the
electrician to wire that house, or for that matter the
plumber; can you see running wires through the walls?
^eah, right.
Indy racer: No one knew it at the time, but a picture
of the first prototype of a modern Indy racer appeared in
the May '26 Technic. Picture it, a 1916 open air touring car
with a wing mounted above it on a flimsy looking wooden
frame. Crude, but definitely Indy. Actually, it was a scheme
'or testing large scale wings since wind tunnels at the
time were not big enough. Now picture a 747 on the back
of a Honda Civic. ..
Extinct: Next time your playing trivia and someone
asks for the name of the car that got laughed off the
market, don't say Edsel, say Hupmobile. Let's run that
bV one more time, it is spelled H-u-p-m-o-b-i-l-e. If you
thought it was something else you're reading too fast.
Ffeud would understand.
Historical note: In 1926 some obscure author by the
name of Arthur E. Morse published a comprehensive book
On the history of radio. What made him think he knew
50 much about it? Well da da da di di di da da da to you
too'.
50 and 25
Years Ago

25 Years Ago
Last month we examined the emphasis on military/
defense issues in the Technic at 1951. Keeping to this same
topic, as promised, portions of an ad for Republic Steel
appearing in the October '51 Technic are reprinted below.
It shines a little light on the attitudes of people in 1951.
"It was spooky down in the celler.
"The wife had taken over the upstairs radio for
her pet soap opera, and the kids had their eyes
glued to the western on TV. So I had to dig up the
old portable, hidden away in the basement storeroom.
"When the newscast was over, I clicked off the set
and just sat there, thinking about other men in
cellars of communist-dominated countries. Men listen-
ing at the risk of their lives to broadcasts from beyond
the Iron Curtain. To words of Freedom.
"The Great Red Father doesn't like hidden radios!
I don't wonder he cracks down, because Freedom
and dictatorship don't mix. We took hold of our
Freedoms back in 1776 and, through wars and
depressions, we've hung on to them mighty hard.
"Those Freedoms are all in our Bill of Rights, and
the chances of any outside enemies taking them away
from us seem pretty slim to me. But we mustn't forget
the enemies inside out boundaries, too.Thereligious
and race hate-makers . . . the pint size dictators . . .
the wild eyed reds and the slimy parlor pinks. The
woods are full of 'em.
"And if we aim to keep our Freedom of religion
and speech and press ... if we want to keep our jobs
safe, like mine down at the Republic mill, helping
produce important steel . . . then we've got to keep
our eyes and ears wide open to spot these inside
enemies. They might be miles away ... or living
within out own community.
"In other words, we must keep informed about
what's going on today. That's why I didn't want to
miss the newscast . . . even if I had to risk my
rheumatics in the dark, damp cellar."
One can see the paranoiac attitude that McCarthy so
effectively played upon. It seems a bit odd, though, for a
steel advertisement. Republic Steel could be obtained by
simply writing to Republic Steel.
No malice intended toward Republic Steel, our only
intention has been to examine attitudes 25 years ago.

HEALTH SERWCE 2001
by Steve Hayrao
My belly started to rumble. "Uh-oh," I thought. "Not
again." Traditionally we students get the raw deal —
especially in food and books.
I could just feel the hot dog turning my stomach. Damn
food-a-matic. Chuck said it wasn't working this morning.
The machine gave him a half-synthesized fried egg for
breakfast. And cold hash browns. And three gooey drops
of orange whatever. He said the stuff was awful. My hot dog
tasted like a 'cold' dog. I touched the half-eaten meal in
the center. Not even warm and right out of the slot. I bet
it didn't even cook the soymeat.
I tried to think of other things. I'd better get to work
on that homework set due tomorrow. Just how many
nuclear fusion reactors in the United States and twenty-
three other 'free-world' nations could be constructed to
reduce the overworked, environment-polluting, dirty coal-
fueled electrical power plants by one-half in five years?
Assuming, of course, that the fission reactors could be
counted on to handle the increased peak loads during the
aforementioned's construction time before their own final
phase-out. If not, phase them out completely and redesign
for fusion power production.
Atypical engineering problem — ambiguous wording and
insufficient data. I just couldn't get started. My gut was
killing me.
Suddenly the front door slammed open. A robot in
white rushed in and, not hesitating in the least, headed
straight for me. Before I could say a word, the white blur
picked me up by the waist, lifted me over its head, carried
me into my bedroom, dropped me into my bed, and stripped
me.
Oh no," I thought. "Somebody sent over a sadistic,
ugly 'rent-a-whore' robot. I bet that son-of-a-bitch Jerry did
this.
But the robot covered me up, grabbed a wrist for a
couple of seconds, then released me. The other hind
pressed against my shoulder. I felt the slight tingle of a
hypo. Immediately I got drowsy.
What was happening? I'd been dazed and drugged. My
mouth opened, "Uhhh .. . duhh, huh?"
In an icy, antiseptic voice the robot replied, 'Will the
patient please speak English? I am not programmed to
respond in any other language."
I tried to regain my composure. What was I doing babbling
in front of a robot ? The anger growing with in me struggled to
fight off the surrounding sleepy mist. My voice sounded
weak and disgusting and so far away as I tried to shout
I heard a mouse-like squeak. It was my voice. It said.
"Patient? Who's patient?" I felt stronger. "What the hell
are you doing here? What gives you the right?"
"I am programmed to answer only one question at a
time. I will account for my actions retroactive to entry.
The dull monotone continued. "You are Citizen #345D-8A2
You are a Patient of the State. I, Nurse #C4T3Z, have the
responsibility for your care during your illness. My patients
call me 'Florence.'
The robot paused.
"Good God," I thought, battling the clouds. "Florence'
Oh yeah, now I remember. So this is a Florence,
huh'
Revolutionizing medicine and bringing back the house call.
I yawned.
The robot droned on, "Your Abnormal Health indicator
is 29.6 for your specific health inefficiency. This numb*"5
compiled from your medical history; from the Arti'lCI3
and Biological pollution indices for this building. '"'J
sector, and this district; from the MURC index forthlS

Michigan Technic


luest made through proper channels, available free of
ardje to the public. The data is correlated and predictions
; projected as to the probability of a human contracting a
alth inefficiency."
My eyelids momentarily closed, bouncing lazily. On
id on and on ...
"I am now quoting The Mandatory Health Act, passed
to law on January 1, 2001, Statute #26, Paragraph 6
action C: 'Whenever a Citizen's AMI reaches 25.0 or
-eater a nurse is notified and sent to the Citizen's home.
he Citizen becomes a Patient of The State, waiving all of
ie Individual's Rights. He must cooperate in every way
ossible whether or not he requires attention.' This is the
nd of the quote. This service is performed free of charge
or all University-affiliated personnel whose credit is in
icod standing."
I squinted, seeing flashes of red and smoky gray, on a
milky-white background. Then the sensor lights grew
dimmer. And dimmer. The fog was everywhere. I had never
seen a Florence before . . . my first Florence. I could
hardly stay awake I was so excited. I dozed off.
Silence.
"Your AH I of 29.6 for appendicitis is critical. As soon
as the body temperature stabilizes, I will remove the
appendix."
Pain. Scorching pain. I tried to massage my stomach, but
my hands wouldn't move.
I opened my eyes. The damned nurse was holding me.
How 1 hated those blinking sensors.
"Let go of me DAMMIT!"
"Your body temperature has not stabilized as yet. Please
remain lying face up. Stabilization will occur in four
minutes."
"DAMMIT! MY BELLY HURTS. LEAVE ME ALONE!"
"I will administer pain-killer and a sedative in accordance
with pre-operation procedures."
"'Pre-operation procedures?' " I repeated. This was
getting serious — time to watch out.
I switched voices, coming on super-sweet. "Wait a
minute, Florence. All I've got is an upset stomach."
"An upset stomach is a symptom," recited Florence.
Inches away from my face a needle popped out of the
rock-steady left hand.
Keep that needle away from me.
The nurse's right hand clamped even tighter to hold me
down for the shot. But I didn't want no metallic heavy-duty
nurse cutting me up. I had to distract that robot - and get
away.
"Symptoms of what, Florence?" (Ever try to sweet-talk
a robot?)
Keep that needle away from me.
The shoulder tingled again. Another minute and I'd be
9one, long gone. A refugee from a junkyard scrap heap
would dissect me like a frog.
'You have appendicitis."
I screamed my lungs out. "NO! IMPOSSIBLE! I had my
appendix removed when I was eight years old — before you
even had this stupid law." I struggled but the nurse's grip
was too strong. I cried out bloody murder — my murder.
MY heart beat wildly, the sweat poured off my body. I
kicked up a storm, flailed my arms futilely. I was fighting
for my life.
But the battle was over. I was slowing down, fading fast.
The knockout drugs were getting to me. My arms weakened.
What could I do? When Florence sees I have no appendix,
will it cut out my intestines - or my bladder - or maybe
my kidneys instead? I felt so tired, so helpless.
"That's it," I thought. "I can fake sleeping, then jump
the robot as soon as I'm released."
So I stopped everything, my arms lying listlessly around
my head, shutting my eyes to a slit, waiting. But I was so
tired.
I had to stay awake. Think of how I'm going to kill that
ugly robot . .. must stay awake . . .
My mind jolted back to reality. My wrists were freed!
Through my ever so slightly cracked eyelids, I watched
the callous robot moving to my side, standing there like the
ape-like bouncers at the Nova's Star Lounge. Up jerked
the right arm. Click. Phhhffft. A scalpel appeared on the
robot's right hand, gleaming in the light of the sensors,
flashing the hated red and gray, red and gray. A lamp
focused on my bared belly. Chills rattled my spine.
Luckily, my hands were out of robot's sight and behind
my head. Groping, my eyes still barely open, my hands
found the window sill behind me, then the drapes. The
drapes!
The nurse bent over my abdomen slightly, poised,
ready.
1 pulled the drapes with all my might. The drapes
floated, sinking, trapping the robot beneath.
I scrambled out of bed, running into the kitchen.
RIP. RIP. I heard the scalpel shearing the curtains into
shreds. Whew! That could have been me.
The robot charged out of the bedroom, making a beeline
for the kitchen. Now my kitchen has two entrances. I
could keep going in circles, but not forever.
Let's not overlook the easy way out.
"Florence," I yelled. "I don't have an appendix."
No answer. The robot, still relentlessly circling the
kitchen, just one step behind its naked prey, ignored me.
Weapon. Weapon. I need a — a baseball bat! I escaped to
the living room and flew to the closet, grabbed the old-
fashioned wooden baseball bat, and swung with all I had,
smashing the robot smack in the face.
The nurse stopped. Lights blinked, gears grinded, circuits
shorted. But the thing kept coming.
And I kept swinging.
Finally, in a skin-singeing shower of sparks, wires, and
oil, the head fell off, clanging on the floor.
I did it! I congratulated myself. I danced jigs around my
vanquished victim. But my elation was short-lived. My
knees buckled, and I slumped to the floor, my overdrugged
system finally catching up with me. I yawned, "Ha, ha, ha,"
and laid down on the rug, curling up into a comfortable
fetal position. Man is just too dependent on machines.
We're bound to, hell, we're asking to get screwed.
Crash! The door caved in. A robot in a white uniform
with blinking scarlet red and smoky gray lights headed
right at me.
I yawned again, and nodded off into oblivion. Zzz . . .
ZZZ . . ZZZ .

Yes, some magazines you read in the closet. Indeed,

Dick Dent's job was made in Belgium.
Dick and his family live at 2905
Phillips St. in South Charleston,
West Virginia.
He works just ten minutes away
at the local Union Carbide plant.
But his job was created thousands
of miles away.
You see, Dick's job is to make spe-
cial chemicals called catalysts.
These catalysts are shipped to
Belgium and other countries where
Union Carbide plants depend on
them to make petrochemicals that
are sold abroad.
This interdependence is not un-
usual in the countries where Union
Carbide and its affiliates work.
By manufacturing abroad we have
actually increased the foreign
demand for many products we make
here at home.
This in turn has created more jobs
here at home. A recent study shows
our investment overseas has directly
created at least 2,500 jobs in our
plants in the U.S.
Still, we manufacture abroad only
when it becomes unfeasible to supply
and maintain a market from the US.
In fact, we export products from
America to 100 foreign countries."
All of which is another way of say-
ing that our international investment
is helping improve the standard of
living for people abroad and at home.
Including Dick Dent and his
family.

Sue is studying how crystal and thin-film
semiconductors interact with light. Using special
high-vacuum equipment and an electron gun built
to her specifications, she has been bombarding
such materials as gallium phosphide and gallium
arsenide with electrons. Then she examines the
change in electrical current as the surface reacts to
light. Data from these experiments are used to
analyze the behavior of semiconductors under
development at several Bell Labs and Western
Electric facilities.
Sue's research today may yield important

Higher Than Your Average Kite-
The University of Michigan Flyers!
by Chuck Schatz
On a cold, cloudy and foggy morning of November 4,
1976, I found myself in a red VW Beetle on the way to Ann
Arbor Airport. The ride was courtesy of Bart Naughton, a
member of the U. of M. Flyers, Incorporated, who kindly
invited me to fly with him as guest passenger for Technic.
I was thrilled to the core, at first. The reality of going into
anything but a Boeing jet hadn't quite struck me yet.
We arrived not more than ten minutes after leaving the
campus, and got out at the Club's Airport headquarters.
Bart pointed out the hangars that housed the Club's
aircraft: four Cessna' 150's, a 1976 Grumman American
Cheetah, and a 1975 Cessna Cardinal. The Club is currently
leasing a Bellanca Citabria, a stunt plane for the more
adventurous members, and plans to purchase or lease a
complex aircraft in the near future.
The plane schedules were checked, and Bart booked us
on the Grumman Cheetah. After preflight checkout of the
airplane, we got in, noted the fuel was running low but
still acceptable, taxied to the head of the landing strip,
checked the engines, and took off on cue. There started
one of the stranger experiences of my life, and I ended up
asking myself, "What am I doing here?"
In between turning green from forces my body wasn't
used to, I pulled my shattered nerves together long enough
to take pictures of a large, brown, sprawling complex which
I later realized was Briarwood Mall. "You're now going on
a grand tour of Ann Arbor," proclaimed Bart. No shit,
Sherlock. Just get me down in one piece, that's all I as

The Flyers participate in the National Intercollegiate
ing Association competitions (called by some the Rose
jvl of college flying), which includes accuracy landings,
drop events, and navigation and instrument proficiency
nts. NIFA meets are held once a year, in the spring, at
at ions all over the country, with teams consisting of
/one qualified to pilot an aircraft, student pilot or other-
ie. In fact, the Flyers have done very well in competition
iey have an impressive trophy cabinet) as evidenced by
•mber Sandy Bacsayni, who is the 1976 nationally top-
lkecl collegiate woman pilot.
The Club has facilities for instructing pilots of various
:ings through certified flight instructors, and the cost
:ms reasonable, compared to other flight schools in Ann
bor. Through the Flyers, the estimated cost of a Private
lot's License is $1000, whereas elsewhere in the area it
Duld run about $1500 to $2000 in instruction.
Typical Club dues run $17 to $25 a month, depending
t the amount of flying done. Most members fly an hour a
ionth, the minimum that must be flown as an active
lember. However, there is a clause for members who can't
Y for a few months for reasons such as summer vacation;
lese people do not have to pay dues. The cost can be paid
Dr by a ten-hour per week job, or by cleaning up hangars or
cashing and waxing airplanes, whatever is around.
Pilot's licenses are broken up into four main grades (each
n order of importance): Student, Private, Commercial, and
Airline Transport.
Student licenses are equivalent to learner's permits, which
ire assigned only if the instructor believes the student is
qualified to pilot on his own. It is called a Third Class
Vledical Permit, and allows the student pilot to solo for a
period of 90 days from the date of issue of the permit.
After 90 days the student pilot must be re-examined by the
instructor and certified before another permit is issued, and
process is repeated until issuance of a Private Pilot's
License. The student pilot is only allowed to fly VFR
(Visual Flight Rules), which simply means "see and be seen."
Private Pilot's Licenses are issued on certification by a
flight instructor, if the student pilot has flown at least 40
hours, 20 with an instructor, 20 solo. More typically, 50 to
55 hours of flight time, half instructed and half solo, are
needed before a private license is given.
A Commercial License is roughly equivalent to a chau-
ffeur's license, and is given on certification and completion
of 250 hours of flight time. It is mainly a polishing license
given to pilots who have some experience in adverse weather
flying and emergency conditions. It is a required license
if the pilot charges money to transport people as a livelihood
(such as an air taxi), and is useful for flying company-owned
aircraft as well.
Airline Transport Licenses are the top licenses, and con-
sequently are the hardest to attain. They require 1500 hours
of flight time, and needless to say, not many pilots get them.
Starting at the Private Pilot level come the numerous
ratings. The ratings determine what special skills pilots
possess to be able to fly certain kinds of aircraft and
the conditions under which they can fly. The most basic
rating is the IFR (Instrument Flight Rules) rating, which
allows flight through clouds and poor weather conditions.
The IFR rating requires 200 hours of flight time, 40
hours simulated (20 with an instructor, 20 with a passenger
anda"visor"thatobstructseverything but the control panel).
Other ratings include multi-engine, sea-plane, glider, helicop-
ter, and acrobatic flying.

t ier , open to all who could conquer it. But in the last
scades it has become increasingly apparent that some
of constitution for the sea is needed. Countries could
go to war over just one of the sea's many resources.
resources include fish and mineral resources such as
&gt;re oil, natural gas and deep seabed minerals, the most
tant being manganese nodules, which are abundant
; deep waters of the Pacific. There are other issues too.
ation rights, marine pollution, and scientific research
I topics which warrant careful discussion and some sort
ju/ation for the countries of the world,
camples illustrating these problems that have recently
ared in the news are:
ne United States had only a 12-mile fishing limit.
;equently Russian and East European fishing trawlers
3 thorough fishing techniques have fished so much off
*4ew England banks that the American catch has dropped
lercent in ten years.
teven American tuna boats fishing in the Pacific Ocean
ost 200 miles from the coast of South America were
ed by Ecuadorian naval vessels for fishing illegally. The
lers had to pay S3 million in fines and other costs to
the boats and crews released.
A United States company filed a claim with the U.S.
te Department for a large section of the Pacific seabed
mine manganese nodules. A dispute began when another
npany claimed that the ocean bottom is no one's
&gt;perty and announced it would take the nodules without
.ing anyone's permission.
Canadian officials were fearful that ship-borne pollution
&gt;uld wreck Canada's northern ecology so they declared
i Northwest Passage through the Arctic Ocean as an in-
•nal Canadian waterway, subject to its own pollution-
ntrol regulations. Other countries have followed suit in
claring rights and regulations over waterways adjoining
eir territories.
Marine law is as old as civilization itself. In ancient
.Ties, it was believed that the sea and its resources be-
nged to everyone and to no one. The Romans viewed the
■a as "public gifts" like sun and air. But even by the 13th
intury, several city-states were demanding that passing
lips pay a toll for passage through adjoining waterways.
\% nations grew and developed commercial and naval
ivalries, the fight for control of the sea grew fiercer. In
he late 15th century Spain and Portugal attempted to
livide whole oceans between themselves as a papal grant.
They were challenged by the emerging maritime powers of
Britain, France, and Holland. In 1609 a Dutch jurist, Hugo
Grotius, published a treatise which outlined the concept of
the sea which was followed for more than 200 years. In it
he admonished that "the sea is common to all, because it is
so limitless that it cannot become a possession of anyone
and because it is adapted for the use of all, whether we con-
sider it from the point of view of navigation or of fisheries."
Countries have traditionally claimed a narrow strip of
Water around their shores as under their complete control.
The distance was originally three miles wide-the maximum
range of a cannonball in the 18th century. More recently a
nine-mile "contiguous zone" was added in which the border-
ing country had control over fishing and mineral resources
and could board and inspect vessels passing through the
zone, but it could not prevent ships from navigating the
waters or laying underseas pipelines and communication
cables.
The United States was the first to breach these tradition-
al rules when in 1945 it claimed jurisdiction over the
mineral resources contained in the submerged continental
shelf extending from the shore. Other countries began to
follow suit by extending their territorial seas to varying
distances of 12, 50, 130, and 200 miles from shore. The
grab for the oceans had continued ever since.
In order to cope with the demands of the countries of
the world and the conflicts surrounding the seas, the United
Nations organized a Law of the Sea conference to try to
resolve the many conflicts and write up a constitution
governing the sea for all countries. The conference is made
up of 2000 delegates, representing more than 140 countries
from all over the world.
The first meeting of the conference lasted 10 weeks and
was held in Caracas, Venezuela in 1974. Only three major
points were agreed upon: the territorial sea adjoining the
countries should be widened from 3 miles to 12 miles;
an "economic zone" extending 200 miles from the shore
should beestablished with the coastal countries having control
over all the resources in that zone; and the minerals in the
ocean beyond the 200-mile limit should be shared among
all nations as "the common heritage of all mankind."
But even these three points raised more questions than
they provided solutions for. For instance, was every speck
of land entitled to a 200-mile limit? What would happen to
countries which are close together and whose boundaries
overlap? And from what point is the 200-mile boundary
drawn?
The conference was roughly divided between 106 less-
developed countries, led by China, and 20 leading industrial
and maritime nations, including most of Western Europe,
the United States, the Soviet Union, and Japan. The less-
developed countries sought to limit the advantages of the
developednationsby puttingrestrictionson mineral resources
taken out of the 200-mile zone and keeping exclusive rights to
the 200-miles of sea surrounding their countries. The
developed countries sought limited national jurisdiction in
the 200-mile zone and freedom of action outside the zone.
On every issue there was hot debate, but the one that
drew the most discussion was navigational rights. If the
territorial seas were extended to 12 miles, 11 6 straits of the
world would be ruled by the countries adjoining them.
The countries could limit ships' passageway through these
straits and board and inspect them at random.
Clearly this indicates that a new law of the sea is needed.
The Law of the Sea conference is seeking a solution to the
many problems of the world concerning the oceans, but they
seem rather far away from reaching even a basic agreement.

I'd been talking to a friend of mine, Marvin, and the
topicgot around to how he happened to get into engineering.
Marv, a freshman, said the story was kinda long and weird.
"How do you mean?" I asked.
"Well you know how engineering language is so wrapped
up in the particular jargon of its own individual field?"
I nodded.
"Well that's how the story goes," he began, "When I was
a senior in high school, this is what happened:"
A familiar voice shrilled from the living room of the
farmhouse where I lived.
"Maaarrrvin. Where are you?"
"Damn," I said into the phone. "What does she want
now? Listen Rosie, I..."
"Who's that, Marvin?"
"That's my mother, Rosie."
"Marvin, please come here. Your father and I would like
to talk to you."
"Uh, listen Rosie. I gotta hang up now. Look, I'll come
over later tonight if I can, O.K.?"
"You never want to talk to me do you? All you ■"
"Bye, Rosie." Click. Girls. Sometimes, just sometimes I
wish, . . . But then again, the big high school dance was
next week.
Running into the living room, I found my parents
looking over a book. The white soft cover book was the
University of Michigan Bulletin for the College of Engineer-
ing, 1976- 1977.
Not that college stuff again. I winced as I remembered
the past few weeks of irritation. My parents were on a
crusade to find the perfect college for me. They had already
chosen my career for me ■ engineering, having previously
picked out dentistry for my older brother George and
nursing for my older sister Marie.
"Sit down over here, dear," my mother pointed to the
large stuffed easy chair next to her.
"Ma," I protested, "I don't wanna be an engineer."
My parents ignored me. They sat calmly on the couch,
flipping the pages of the little white book. Then they
stopped.
"Listen, son," said dad. "Here's a course you'd like. I
don't really know that much these courses, being so techni-

"No, pop, I think they mean that when something can't
take the heat anymore or is just plain overloaded, it fails."
"That's just what I'm talking about." Dad was really
hot under the collar. "They're telling you that you can't do
your job 'cause you've been fretting on in shock or you're
cracking up. You get sick and your operation's a failure too.
Then you get the adhesion, abrasion, pitting, and the
spalling. Sounds like hell. You'd have a tough time trying

Wide-eyed and seeing her husband's anger growing
steadily, my mother shook her head emphatically from side
to side.
Meanwhile, I'd completely forgotten about Rosie. I was
loving every minute of pop's tantrum. I wanted more. I

"My father was a proud man," Marv said. "He'd already

he wasn't going to back down from his gut feeling that his
youngest son was meant to be an engineer."
"So?"
"So he made me promise to get to the bottom of this

for convenience. Programming the computer for mass
production is convenient. Unfortunately, forgetting techno-
logical know-how is just as convenient.

the
Law of Gravity
till Cowie
&lt;Aany years ago, Isaac Newton formulated two relations
.veen a force and a mass. One of these relations stated
t thie force exerted on an object is equal to the product
the mass of the object, and the acceleration caused by
t force. The other relation is that any object in the
verse exerts a force on any other object. The magnitude
his force is equal to the product of the two masses, times
onstant, G, (the universal gravitational constant), divided
the square of the distance between the two objects.
wton assumed that the 'mass' in the first case, that is,
: property Which causes it to resist the acceleration by a
•ce is identically the same as the property which causes
gravitational attraction. In other words, you could not
il the difference between standing on earth, and standing
an enclosed rocket ship, deep in space, which was acceler-
\n«j at 32.2 ft/sec. For many years, it was taken for
•anted that this equality, called the theory of equivalence,
as valid. But recently, a number of physicists have ques-
oned this assumption. The controversy has yet to be re-
al ved.
A few hundred years after Newton, Albert Einstein pre-
ervxed his special theory of relativity, and soon thereafter,
V»vs general theory of relativity, showing that Newton's
laws were a special case of more general laws^. The first-order
predictions of the general theory of relativity have been
tested and found to be accurate. The higher-order predictions
include gravitational waves and black holes. But the most
significant prediction is that G, the gravitational constant, is
precisely a constant. None of these higher order predictions
have yet been confirmed, nor have any been disproven.
But recently, there has been some observed evidence
that G may not be a constant at all, but rather, a variable
dependent upon either absolute time (the age of the
universe), or the distance between the objects, or possibly
both. If this preliminary evidence is confirmed, it would
seriously shake up both the theory of equivalence and
the general theory of relativity, a rather substantial portion
of physics! Following, is the evidence.
In 1937, P.A.M. Dirac formulated what has become
The special theory of relativity says one can not travel
at the speed of light. We are not concerned with this here,
but rather the general theory of relativity.
^Although different cosmologists will give different values
for the radius and the age of the universe, they generally
agree within an order of magnitude. Since these ratios
are only of orders of magnitude, this accuracy is sufficient.
known as the large-numbers hypothesis. Basically, it goes
as follows. The largest basic unit of length one can think of
is the radius of the theoretical edge of the universe. The
smallest basic unit of length is the radius of the electron's
orbit in the hydrogen atom. The ratio of these two numbers
is of the order of magnitude of 10.42. Similarly, for time,
the ratio of largest to smallest is that of the age of the
universe to the time required for a photon to cross the ato-
mic radius (travelling at the speed of light)2. This ratio is
also about 10^2. A third ratio is that of the electrostatic
force to the gravitational force, or E/G. This, it turns out,
is also of the order of magnitude of 1Q42i So what we have
then, is either an incredible coincidence, or, as Dirac pre-
fers to believe, a previously undiscovered relationship.
But Dirac also noticed that the first two of these ratios
are constantly changing, as the universe is slowly getting older
and expanding. Since the 3 ratios are apparently related, this
would then imply that the third ratio, that of the 2
"constants", E/G is also changing. But which one is
changing? This is where the first observational evidence
comes in.
If G is decreasing, then the force of gravitational
attraction between the earth and the moon (of any two
bodies) is weakening, and the distance between the earth
and moon is slowly increasing, causing the period of the
moon's revolution about the earth to slowly increase.3
An experiment was set up 20 years ago to detect any change
in the period of revolution of the moon, based on atomic
time, using cesium clocks. But the rate of change which
they are attempting to detect is estimated at about one part
in 20 billion per year, and the error in the experiment is
greater than the change in time of one revolution of the
moon. But after 20 years of collecting data, the cumulative
change has become large enough to measure, and it has
become possible to determine the change in the moon's
revolutionary period. The results of this data, and various
philosophical arguments beyond the scope of this article
indicate that E is a constant, but G is indeed changing!
Meanwhile, two other experiments have been set up to
attempt to detect changes in the distances between various
heavenly bodies. One experiment involves bouncing pulses
of laser light off mirrors left on the moon by the Apollo
astronauts, and measuring the time it takes for the pulse
to return to earth. This gives a direct measurement of the
distance to the moon. The other experiment involves
bouncing radar pulses off the inner planets, to measure
changes in the distances between the earth and Mercury and
Venus. Again, due to the error in these very precise measure-
ments, the experiments must be carried out over a long
period of time, so that the cumulative change in the quantity
being measured becomes greater than the error in the
experiment. Therefore, the results of these two experiments
are not yet known, although some preliminary indications
should be produced by the end of this decade.
continued on page 18
^Even if G is not changing, the moon is still slowly receding
from the earth, and its period of revolution is increasing,
due to the frictional effects of the tides which the earth
and moon produce on each other. This, and other possible
effects, have been carefully measured and accounted for.

11 - A Plant Tour
by Randy Warsaw
By 1980, the Detroit area will be receiving its power
from a new source, Fermi-2. Fermi-2 is a nuclear power
plant located a few miles from Monroe Michigan on the
same property as Fermi-1. Fermi-1 was an experimental
LMFBR (Liquid Metal Fast Breeder Reactor) that was
built as a prototype power plant. A Fast Breeder produces
more fuel than it uses. Fermi-1 had an accident; a partial
core meltdown crippled the plant for three years. The
plant was put back into operation and the rest of the
fuel inventory was burned. It was then decommissioned
by the A.E.G. (Atomic Energy Commission) because the
plant lacked the safety equipment required on the newer
reactors. Now it has been converted to a rather inefficient
and expensive oil plant that is only operated during peak
loads in the system. It has a generating capacity of around
one-hundred megawatts of electric power.
Fermi-2 construction started in 1968 on land near Lake
Erie which Detroit Edison (Fermi's owner) reclaimed from
swamp. To do this four and one half million tons of rock
were quarried to form a base for the plant. The estimated
cost of the plant in 1968 was 550 million dollars. The
estimate at the present time is 990 million dollars. The
difference in the costs is due to the rising costs of labor and
materials, new mandatory safety systems that were not
required when construction began and construction delays
due to the lack of funding. It is interesting to note that the
cost of constructing coal plants has risen the same amount
percentage-wise.
When I first saw Fermi II, I was overcome with a feeling
of awe. The buildings are over one hundred and thirty feet

The core is housed in a steel tank called a Press
r ttnp\ |fl
vessel. The Fermi vessel contains almost 770 tons ois
this vessel the steam is produced. The whole steam sy
operates at 1000 pounds per square inch. Cooling
flows at 100 million pounds per hour. The steam

produced carries away the core heat. When the s

flows at 14 million pounds of steam per hour.
The s'63

is dried to prevent the pitting of the turbine blad«
velocity liquid water. The steam goes to the turbm6
the separator (dryer). The turbines are linked to a9e
14


V a common shaft. The generator produces the power, and
team is then condensed and sent back to the core.
The condenser is a simple heat transfer mechanism. It
ontains two loops of pipe. One loop carries the steam and
he other carries the coolant (cold water). These two loops
ire very close together so that as the steam passes through
ts loop it is cooled by the cold water passing through the
nher loop. Two things happen: first, the steam is cooled
and condenses back to liquid, second, the coolant water
is heated. The warm coolant water cannot be dumped in Lake
Erie because it would raise the temperature of the lake and
cause ecological damage. Therefore, it is one to two cooling
towers.
The cooling towers are like two big chimneys. The warm
coolant water enters the cooling tower near the base. Here
the water gives up its excess heat to the air by convection.
The heated air then rises. When the ascending warm air
reaches the necking of the tower its velocity begins to
increase. By the time the air reaches the top of the tower it
had gained a large enough velocity to shoot it 1000 ft. in
the air. At this height the warm air is dispersed without
disturbing the local climate. Once the coolant water is cooled
in the cooling tower it is returned to the pond.
The radioactive material in the core is isolated from the
environment in three levels. The first level is the massive
Dressure vessel. The second is the primary containment; a
115 foot dry well. This well has first, a one inch steel plate
first layer and then seven feet of steel reinforced concrete.
The dry well is tested at several atmospheric pressure to in-
sure airtightness. Once the drywell is tested no welding may
be done on the system. The last level is — the actual reactor
building. This building can withstand earthquakes or winds
three times stronger than hurricane strength.
The safety of the plant was the primary concern for
the designers. Every system has at least one back up
system and every part of the plant has complete documen-
tation. The information contained on a typical part includes
where the material came from, in what batch it was processed,
how and where it was stored, and a log of routine main-
tenance performedon it.The Nuclear Regulatory Commission
(NCR) may ask at any time to inspect the documents of any
part in the plant.
The NCR further demands the plant conform to all the
safety requirements put into effect during construction.
This means constant re-design. There must also be several
ways to scram (emergency shut down) the reactor. Some of
these are automatic and some are manual.
Fermi-2 is a very impressive example of high technology
engineering. Most people have very little idea of all that goes
into a power system or the lengths that are gone to to
insure the safety of the population and ecology. Fermi-2
will be a modern day pyramid of our society.

with engineering
or other technical degrees
for careers in shipbuilding.
Let's talk about it


What IB an 0Dm?r?
Indignation - that was thfe feeling of one woman when
lifornia public schools chose to phase the metric system
fh over the inch-pound-quart. "Why," she exclaimed, "it's
wrt of a conspiracy to brainwash the children to favor
Communism. Everyone knows that the Soviet Union and
ill Communist nations use the metric system."
Whether a conspiracy or not, most of the nations on
this earth have converted to metric. The metric system is a
simple decimal form of weights and measures. Formally
called "Le Systeme International d'Unites", the metric
measure has been standardized by the International Bureau
of Weights and Standards in Paris.
Why bother with "Le Systeme International"? Well,
history provides plenty of reasons. The most prominent is
that man is not gifted with an intuitive knowledge for exact
measure.
Earliest known records point to the ancient Egyptians
as establishing the first system of measure. The most
obvious utensils for this measure were the limbs of the body.
A digit was the width of the middle section of the middle
finger. On an outstretched hand, a span was the space between
the tip of the thumb to the tip of the little finger (9 inches).
The cubit was the distance from the elbow to the middle
fingertip and ranged from 18-22 inches.
The Romans are considered responsible for developing
the inch. Using the duodecimal system, division by mul-
tiples of twelve, a unicae (inch) was the twelfth part of a
man's foot. They also developed the yard which was taken
from a man's nose to the tip of his middle finger.
Most importantly, however, was the later evolution of
the English system, for the United States adopted this. The
base measurement was the inch and consisted of ten
peppercorns, of three barleycorns, round and dry. King
Henry II, realizing the need for a standardized system,
composed a confusing inter-relation of monies, weights and
measures called the Assize of Bread and Ale. It states that
the English penny "shall weigh 32 wheatcorns in the midst
December 1976
17


a pound; and 8 pounds do make a gallon of wine; and 8
gallons of wine tto make a bushel . . . ". It was undoubtedly
an improvement to have such a sure base for measure!
Other old English measures define a foot as twelve
barleycorn inches, a furlong as the length of a furrow plowed
by an ox-drawn plow, and an acre as the amount of land a
farmer could plow in a day.
It is very evident that problems with these definitions
could arise. An acre may change with the size and age of
the oxen and the relative perseverance of the farmer.
Barleycorns may differ on a lean or peak year, as would
the weight of wheatcorns. Concerning the Roman yard, I
imagine Sammy Davis Jr. would measure quite differently
than would Moses Malone.
So, in recent years most nationshavefound it advantageous
to define weights and measures in more precise unchanging
terms. The gram is determined to be the weight of a cubic
centimeter of water at maximum density. A precise measure
of this is kept by the International Bureau of Weights and
Standards as a kilogram of platinum-iridium meta .?.'.*
The meter is defined as 1,650,763.73 wavelengths;'

The United States' system of measure has evolwefm

There have also been other observations, whose causes
have not yet been satisfactorily determined, which could
be explained by a decreasing G. For instance, a decreasing
G would cause the gravity of a body to decrease, causing it
to expand and leave huge cracks in its surface. These
cracks, called rift faults, have been observed on both the
Moon and Mars. Also, the expansion of the universe itself
could be due to a constantly decreasing gravity.''
But aside from the possibility that G is changing as the
universe grows older, there are now some preliminary indica-
tions which, if confirmed, would complicate matters even
further. Earlier this year, Daniel R. Long, of Eastern
Washington State College, reported that G may be a func-
tion of the distance between the two bodies. Although the
Mm
inverse square relationship, F=G72~ , has been verified to
a high degree of accuracy at interplanetary distances. Long
decided to test it on a much smaller scale, on the order of
10's of ceritimeters5. His data indicates a change in G as the
distance between 2 objects changes, and proposes that G be
multiplied by .002 times the natural logarithm of the dis-
tance. This would not only complicate matters it would also
indicate that at very small distances there would no longer
be a force of attraction between two objects, but actually a
small repulsive force!6 Long is now waiting for someone to
confirm his results before working on modifications ir w
theory.
These results seem to indicate that one of the am
stones of classical physics - that G is a constant -
be crumbling. This would mean several things: fits.**
inertial mass and gravitational mass are not the a
thing. Second, since the general theory of relativity i«
diets that G is a constant, it would cast serious douot
the validity of this theory. And finally, all the theories,
results based on these assumptions might also

all have to re-learn elementary physics, since part' ^

obsolete. But wait, before you get any ideas about uf^
down the Physics &amp; Astronomy building, let ie'
you that these are preliminary results, which have ye
confirmed.
Nevertheless, if the observations and evidence
are confirmed, we might now be on the brink o ^

'oday, a good percentage of college students are in
)ol because they want to improve their chances for a
d job. This was not always so; at one time, when college
a luxury affordable only to the wealthy, one went to
ege to become "educated", to learn about the arts and
.ellectual" subjects, to make one's life more fulfilling.
! college graduate was not sought by employers as he is
v. In fact, during the transition period between the time
ployers had little use for college graduates and the time
V began to seek them out, there was a long, lingering
judice against them.
In the November 1926 Technic an article entitled "Are
liege Men Wanted?" was reprinted from the Atlantic
mthly (the title is a bit chauvinistic, but those were the
tes). In 1926 the effects of American Industrialization,
i increasing dominance of big business, and a general
:rease in the standard of living were shaping the times.
ie question "Are College Men Wanted?" would be a silly
estion today, in most cases, but 1926 was a transition
ar, employers were hiring college grads but were still
eptical of them.
This particular article focussed on the college graduate
id big business. According to the author, business execu-
ves preferred energetic, intelligent high school grads with
stential for development into tomorrow's business leaders
ver college grads. This created a dilemma; most men with
lose qualities were going to college. A college education,
&gt;' the first time in history, was within the reach of the
mage man, and many were taking advantage of it. Business
'as forced to hire grads against its desires.
According to the article, the main complaint about the
»Hege graduate "is of his overwhelming desire to be ad-
vanced faster than his own development and the exigencies
if business permit." Furthermore, executives felt that
"... no educational training whatever can offer an
acceptable substitute for a reasonable period of actual work
in a business organization." Modern attitudes are certainly
not the same; not only is the college grad sought, room for
his advancement is provided by mandatory retirement.
Behind it all, though, is the fact that a vast majority of
business executives in 1926 did not go to college; they
did not have that opportunity. They were, perhaps, a bit
\ealousanddid not understand what a college education was
all about nor what advantages it provides.
These comments, however, were not intended to apply
to those fields where highly specialized training is required,
such as engineering.

25 Years Ago
One of the greatest technological leaps in the last 25
years has to be the development of the transistor and
associated solid state devices. In the November 1951 Technic
appeared an article on the newly developed junction
transistor. To anyone but an electrical engineer the article
would be gibberish, but it does give a good indication of the
difference in the "state of the art" between now and then.
First of all, the technology for manufacturing transistors
was primitive by today's standards and their cost was out-
rageous, more expensive than vacuum tubes. This, of course,
was partly because they were not being manufactured in the
large quantities they are now. The early transistor was not
usable at frequencies high enough for use in television,
FM radio and many other applications which are common
today. Little hope was given to extending its usable
frequency range. It was also a noisy device, producing
unwanted noise when operated. This further inhibited its
application.
Technological advancement in many areas, such as the
transistor, has been phenomenal. Progress in many non-
technical areas had been stagnant. This irony is acutely
pointed out (not intentionally) in the November '51 Technic.
The article on the transistor reminds one of the great
technological progress while two other articles discuss issues
which are essentially unchanged today.
The first of these articles provides a very convincing
argument that engineering students should be exposed to
some kind of basic economic theory or accounting. There is
a little too much to summarize here, but an effective argu-
ment is built that all engineering students could use some
exposure to these subjects, whether the student will work in
research, design, development, production, sales, or field
engineering. Where are we today? Most students graduate
without any exposure to these fields, even though the need
has been recognized for years.
Thesecondarticleisaneditorialconcerning the profession-
al registration of engineers. It argues for the nation-wide
registration of engineers. The crux of the argument is that
engineers are concerned with the quality of life, public
health and well being, and many areas with associated
social and environmental impact, therefore a means of
assuring that engineers are competent to handle these
responsibilities is needed. Doctors and lawyers are re-
gistered; so should engineers. The issue stands today as it
did twenty-five years ago. A few states have laws requiring
engineers to be registered, but it varies from state to state.
There is no national consensus or procedure.

in bull manure). ISTVE is simply a conglomeration of
notable and not-so-notable quotes compiled by the Technic
staff. To all you throbbing masses who demanded it, here
it is.
The cover this month graphically displays the subject of
the lead article "Dial a Computer: The Merit Computer
Network." The Merit computer network is an arrangement
between UM, Wayne State, and Michigan State which
allows users of one University's computer system to access
any of the other systems, expanding the resources of the
user. The network has been around for quite a few years
but is not widely known. The author of the article is Greg
Werth, whom we are welcoming aboard this month.
Maybe a few of you noticed last November that an
article I talked about in this column did not appear. That
was not a belated April fools joke, just a common everyday
flub. The article is "Nuclear - It's More Than Just hm
and appears on page twelve of this issue (if all goes««
The article was written by resident Nuke Head M
Warsaw who was thoroughly disgusted at having to torn
himself of the layman's level.
As a special feature this month we have an article»
the director of business and technical personnel for Eastmsf

from the editor's desk
Will you be three credits short when you intend to
aduate? Did you have to drop that math course mid-
ay through the term because you couldn't handle the
ork load? Have you ever had to repeat a course (which
robably had nothing to do with your major)? Maybe you
idn't realize until too late that you need another social
;ience? If you are nodding your head in anguished affirma-
ion, you are not alone. The fact of the matter is that
here are a good number of people in the same boat. You
ay that you hadn't planned on another semester, and
'ou can't afford it. That too, is not uncommon.
The root of the problem is very simple. Engineers are
equired to have eight more credits to graduate than
L.S.&amp;A. students. This means one extra credit per semester,
/vhich can often times mean an extra class per semester,
^/hat about that semester when all your courses were three
credits? You had five of them, that's only 15 hours. Oops,
one short. Oh well, make it up next term right? That
means 17 hours next term, but by chance, one of the
courses you take is only two credits. You must now take
six courses and two of them happen to be labs. You will be
a busy student. Now, to top things off, one lab instructor
expects you to spend 5 hours per week in lab, even though
only three hours were scheduled. At this point there are two
options, you can either shoot yourself, or drop something
and go an extra semester. But you hadn't planned on that
extra semester, and with the way tuition is rising, you
can't afford it so you get an ulcer.
This problem should not exist. There are several ways
that it can be solved. One solution is to lower the graduation
requirements (I can hear academia screaming already). If
only 120 hours were required for graduation, the tension
would be eased. Essentially this would mean dropping
three courses from your entire program. However, easing
the graduation requirements would degrade the school's
fine reputation for academic excellence. None of us want
that, Particularly students — because that helps us get jobs.
Another, but sneakier, method would be to turn a number
of popular 3 credit courses into four credit courses
(academia is rumbling again). This would lower the number
of courses necessary for graduation by two or three.
The solution proposed most often is switching to a
five year program. The frankness of this approach is
excellent. It symbolises the end of telling prospective
Freshpersons that they will graduate in four years, when in
fact, a good number of them won't. Most students and
their families expect a four year internment, and plan
their budget around that. It's about time to tell the students
that the program will be tough to finish in four years, or
else lighten the schedule.
A five year program has a number of advantages. The pace
can be slowed down so that even if a course needs to be
repeated, the student can finish his program in the allotted
time. It would also provide more time for seniors to
spend on interviewing and finding a job. But I fear the
proponents of the five year program will want to add
another 32 credits to the graduation requirements. That
would be a disaster. If a five year program were instituted,
it should be set up in such a way as to allow brilliant
students to finish in 4V4 years by placing out of pre-
requisites, while the majority of students could take a
lighter load and go the full five years. 150 credits might
be a good compromise.
Before such a move is made, the lowest common denom-
inator must be examined: i.e. the cost. At present rates,
four years at this institution can devastate one's finances.
Five years might prove unmanageable. Many students may
decide to opt for a four year program elsewhere — and
who could blame them.

The MERIT Computer Network
ireg Werth
What is MERIT? No, it's not part of the engineering
lor code. It's a computer network; a powerful tele-
nmunications network which interconnects the computer
terns of Michigan's three largest universities: Michigan
ite University, University of Michigan, and Wayne State
liversity (See figure 1). From the inception of the network
1965 to its most recent advance, that of the Telenet
terconnection, its development has resulted in a very
ccessful computer network, considered by some to be
ie of the most advanced in the world.
History and Development of the MERIT Network
Planning for MERIT began in 1965, and in the spring of
366 Michigan State University, University of Michigan,
id Wayne State University joined in forming the Michigan
iter-University Committee on Information Systems (MICIS).
Originally the objective of MICIS was "to facilitate
laximum interaction and effectively and significantly
slate the efforts of the three universities in the broad
rea of information processing and exchange by computer
nd other electronic media". This original objective was
efined through the early development stages of MICIS
nto a proposal for a statewide network concerned with
haring and developing educational and research facilities.
When the computing facilities of a single
university are joined by a common network
to the computing facilities of other uni-
versities, the computing resources will
then be greater than the sum of the
resources of all the universities in the
network. This seeming paradox occurs
because of the cooperative connection
of machines with significantly different
system characteristics, and because of the
ability of a network potentially to take
advantage of varying system demand.
Thus, to any given user at any single
point of entry to the network, the
whole system appears more powerful
and responsive to his needs than the
collection of individual systems would
be when addressed on an individual basis.
In July, 1969, the Michigan Legislature passed two
Figure 1
enabling acts and associated appropriations for the MERIT
Network, requiring that the $400,000 if made available for
development be matched by the National Science Foundation.
After provision of these matching funds was made by the
National Science Foundation, through its Office of Com-
puting Activities, the new total of $800,000 was further
bolstered to $1,200,000 from contributions of computer
time and other services from the three participating univer-
sities. Continued support for operation and development is
provided by the Governor and the Legislature.
The designing of the overall system and the writing
of the software was done by computer scientists and
engineers from the three universities. The Applied Dyna-
mics Division of Reliance Electric Company in Saline,
Michigan provided the final design and construction of
special hardware. In December 1971, MERIT'S first com-
puter-to-computer transmission of information was accom-
plished. This was followed by several months of required
testing to eliminate errors. In April 1972 two computers
became available for public use followed with the availa-
February 1977


full operation of the network. Further additions and im-
provements are continually being made.
Since then computer users at any of the three univer-
sities are able to "dial a computer" from their own terminal
location. This enables computer users to reach a certain
computer which offers services which pertain especially
to a required task. The system is easy and convenient to use.
A user merely types a few simple instructions into his
terminal and in a matter of seconds he will be on line to a
remote computer. Accomodation of batch jobs by the
system, permits the results to be printed at any of the three
sites of the system.
As its creators intended, the network has become, "an
operational, interuniversity, packet-switching network ser-
ving the computing needs of students and faculty members
at three major universities." On the average, each month
five-hundred individual users transmit over fifty million
bits of information.
MERIT-Telenet Interconnection
The "dial-a-computer" potential of the vase MERIT
Network was recently amplified this past November with
the provision of a MERIT-Telenet interconnection.
Telenet is a large public-packet-switching network
for data communications which has been commercially
available in the U.S. since August 1975. MERIT recently
authorized Telenet to establish an interconnection between
the two networks. This tie became operational in late
November 1976. The "dial a computer" potential has been
increased considerably due to this interconnection. MERIT
can now be accessed through the Telenet network, which
has terminals located in 30 cities throughout the nation,
providing the use of any of the three hosts on MERIT.
Currently there are no plans to offer connections fra
MERIT to other hosts on Telenet, such as MIT'sMUU'3
system and Dartmouth's Kiewit Computing Center.
Packet switching, the fundamental technology used ■
the network, is a method in which transmitted data isforns
into discrete units known as packets. When a message n
be transmitted each packet formed to represent part of *«
message also contains a header which specifies certa^
control functions and the destination where the data s
be transmitted. This enables packets to be delivereditii

MERIT Network Description
The three large systems can act together as a single
)werful computing resource. Three minicomputers, DEC
Jigital Equipment Corporation) PDP-11/20's, provide
e network interconnections between the three hosts.
nese are known as Communication Computers or CC's,
ie of each of which is connected to its respective host
jmputer. (see Fig. 3). The CC's are in turn connected to
ie another through a full-duplex (simultaneous transmission
i both directions) telephone circuit, which transfers data
: 4800 baud. Under normal conditions, network data
ansfers occur between the appropriate pair of CC's.
owever, if a line or modem were to fail, the CC's automa-
cally reroute data transmission through the alternate path,
his feature greatly aids networking reliability, which is
jrther enhanced by sophisticated error checking.
The following is a list of the broad range of services
ffered by the network:
) Classic Interactive, the interaction among two or three
of the network hosts without the expense of normal
long distance telephone transmission. The network
reduces the rate of communication error and makes it
possible for users to work with the local terminal opera-
ting conventions and keyboard editing modes to which
they are accustomed.
?) Enhanced Interactive, which means simply that data
bases from one of the host computers can be used with
an executing program at another host, or on more than
one additional host; it is also possible to display or
print out data from a network task at any of the hosts.
3) Direct Terminal Access, the capability for dialing directly
into the network from a terminal and accessing a remote
host without going through local host. This facility is
provided by HERMES, MEftlT's network-to-terminal
interface, which runs in the individual communications
computers.
4) Network Batch, the most economical of all the MERIT
services, which allows large batch jobs to be entered
into the network at any point and executed at any one
of the hosts, with printed or punched output also
independently routable to any desired host.
5) File Transfer, which allows data to be copied from one
host to another, e.g., from disk to disk, disk to tape, or
disk to printer.
6) Inter-Process Communications, the process of running
programs on one or more host computers concurrently;
programs may be employed simultaneously or sequen-
tially, and they may transfer data from one host to
another.
7) External Access, exemplified currently by the two 300-
baud telephone circuits that provide an interactive link
between the Telenet and MERIT networks. These lines
allow Telenet users to access any of the three MERIT
hosts.
As an example, a user of the network could combine a
state outline map at WSU with a water quality map at U-M
and display the output graphically at the desired host.
When a user at one university would like to use the
resources at another computing center, the following process
is typically followed:
1) access to the local host computer through a local port;
2) access to the MERIT network through the local CC;
3) access to the remote computer through its CC;
4) performance of the computing task.
Many benefits to all three universities have resulted
from the MERIT Network. The network makes it possible,
for the first time, for collaboration in collecting and lumping
together of costly, ponderous data. For network members,
this kind of cooperation in joining acquisitions and sharing
resources has led to considerable savings.
Another important benefit, perhaps somewhat more in-
direct, is the fact that the network has increased the flow
of information between universities. This is significant for
two main reasons. First, researchers on different campuses
working on similar projects have been brought together.
Second, researchers now find pertinent data pertaining to
their project on other campuses which they might otherwise
have missed. This increased cooperation and coordination
among universities helps reduce unnecessary duplication
among different researchers, arid comes at a time when
economic pressures make such duplicate efforts difficult.
The MERIT network has accomplished
its basic goal. It has demonstrated the
feasibility of interconnecting three large
dissimilar academic computing facilities,
and shown that it is possible to share
human and machine resources among
three academic communities to the benefit
of each.

NAVY OFFICER.
IT'S NOT JUST A JOB, IT'S AN ADVENTURE.


There are many uses for nuclear materials, theory, and
byproducts other than large scale power generation. The
atom has made its way into geology, biology, medicine,
criminology, metallurgy, fluid mechanics, and scores of
other fields. The byproducts of reactors may be as beneficial
to man as the reactors themselves. These byproducts are
coming to age in the seventies. They are no longer being
buried indiscriminately in the ground.
Background
Radioactive materials decay or emit radiation in a
manner that may be described by the following first order
rate equation: N(t)=N(0)e-^t. Here N(t) represents the
number of nuclei that have not decayed after time t.
N(0) represents the original number of nuclei and X
is the decay constant for the material in question. X
may be found by introducing the concept of halflife.
Halflife is experimentally determined. It is defined as the
time it takes for half the sample to decay. That is, N
(halflife)=y2N(0). For the balance of this article halflife
will be represented by V/2. From here we may find X.
N(r/2)=N(0)e-XTy2. Substituting we have: %N(0)=N(0)e"^T1/J.
Taking the natural log we have: 1n2=^TV2. Therefore
1n2/TVi=X. The activity of a material («) at time t is equal
to the decay constant multiplied by the number of nuclei
remaining. «=N(T)X. The specific activity is the activity
per gram of a given material and is constant for any given
material. This decay theory becomes more complex when
the material decays into another material that is also
radioactive. The original material is then called the parent
while the subsequent materials are called daughters.
The number of daughter nuclei is dependent on the
rate of production of the daughter and the rate of decay of
the daughter. The rate of production of the daughter is the
rate of decay of the parent. The parent to radioactivedaughter
decay is more prevalent than the decay to a stable daughter
so these more complex calculations must not be ignored
in nuclear work.
Radiodating
Many dating techniques have been used in anthropology,
biology, and geology, but the most well known is radio-
carbon dating. Radiocarbon dating utilizes carbon"14 con.
stantly being produced in the atmosphere by the carbon
nitrogen cycle. Carbon -14 decays with a halflife of 5739
years. When a living object dies it no longer inhales carbon
-14 from the atmosphere. The carbon -14 in it decays
according to decay theory. By measuring the ratio of modern
day carbon to carbon -14 to the object in question we have
an N(0) and an N(t) respectively. All that remains is to
solve for the time t. rrmre-^t Taking the In of each side
,ffl, , Nm' NiO„
mN(t)=At- And solving for t we finally have: tHnfjp.
Since the halflife of carbon-14 is 5730 we can substitute?
and arrive at t=ln^&gt; X5730/ln2. Geologists have been aS«
to estimate the age of the earth with decay techniques. A
major assumption is necessary to do this. The quantity of
uranium-235 is assumed equal to the amount of uranium-238
at the time of creation. This is a valid assumption and s
is based on the building block theory of the heavier
materials. Since the two materials were equally abundant
at the creation of the earth and they both have differert
decay rates, we have two decay equations and two un-
knowns. The unknowns are t (the time since the creationl
and N(0) (the abundance of the isotopes). We will cat
N(0) N for the remaining of the calculations. The present
relative abundances of uranium-235 and uranium-238 will
be written N1 and N2 respectively. The decay constanB
will also be numbered with 1 and 2. The two equations
are N1=Ne-^1tand N2=Ne"X2t. Dividing the first equation
by the second we eliminate N. We have: N1/N2=e(-A,+^'!
Then we take the natural logarithm of both sides. Then
ln(N1/N2)=(X2-Xl )t. Finally solving for t we have Hn(NI/N2
and N1/N2=.00752. The natural log of this ratio is-4.926,
After looking the two halflives up in a table of the
isotopes we may calculate the two decay constants.
Xl=ln2/™i-ln2/7X108=9.9X10-10year-1
X2=ln/T,/42=ln2/4.5X109=1.5X10-10year-1
X2-Xl=-8.4X10-10year-1
t=-4.926/-8.4X10-10=approximately six billion years.
Six billion years is the theoretical age of the earth. The
oldest rock that has been found to date is 3.5 billion.The
moon rocks brought back have been found to average 4.6
billion years. This probably means that the earth was formed
during the first million and a half years of earth history
The earth's age may also be checked with other dating
ratios. The potassium-40 to argon-40 and the rubidium-
strontium methods are favorites of geologists. The potassium
argon method is a simple decay into a stable isotope
while the rubidium method involves daughters that are also
radioactive.
Nuclear Batteries
Power may be extracted from radioactive decay. W"en
a decay occurs an energetic particle or gamma ray is 91*
off. In passing through a material it will deposit the kine i
energy it has as thermal energy. Nuclear batteries are no
only possible, they already power pacemakers, arctic station
and space equipment. The amount of power generated W
Michigan
Techi*


nuclear battery is proportional to the number of decays per
unit time. This is the activity P(t)=pN(t)X: p is the power
generated by one decay. Remembering that N(t)=N(0)e~At
we haveP(t)=ApN(0)e'^t. Jo simplify things we will set
ApN(0)=P(0). P(0) is the power generated at the beginning
of the battery's life. P(t)=P(0)e-^t. The power generated by
decay is thermal and must be converted to electrical energy.
There are many techniques to do this: 1) The conversion
may be done with a thermal couple, 2)using the decay heat
to boil water to drive turbines that turn generators, 3) the
energy can be deposited in a semiconductor releasing an
electric current, 4) the emission of beta particles (electrons

fitted with a suitable ground.
Nuclear batteries have one big advantage over conventional
batteries; they may be designed to last almost forever. A
nuclear battery that is designed to operate continuously
for fifteen years at maximum power is not uncommon. This
sounds great, but don't throw away your Everready yet!
Nuclear batteries are expensive, inefficient, and those
competitive with high power batteries require substantial
shielding. They are only advantageous where it would be
inconvenienttochange the power batteries, as in pacemakers.
Presently pacemakers use plutonium-238. Plutonium-238
hasahalflifeof 87.8years and a decay constant of 7.89X10"3
years'^ The ratio of s^is the percentage of maximum power
after t years. The ratio also equals e*Xt. Plugging in the
decay constant and a time of approximately ten years we
find the exponential is equal to 92% of full power.
Plutonium-238 has an isotopic power of .56 watts per gram.
Plugging in and chugging we find that 92% of that is .508
watts per gram. Not much difference over ten years. Modern
pacemakers require about 160 microwatts of electric power.
If we assume only one percent conversion then 16 millawatts
are required. The device must last for over ten years so we
divide 16 millawatts by .92 and we find that we need
only 17.4 millawatts for the original source. At .56 watts
per gram we need 31 millagrams, a very small amount.
The typical chemical cell for this device needs to be re-
placed after two years.
Another possibly useful isotope is strontium-90. It has
an isotopic decay power of .93 watts per gram, a halflife
of twenty-nine years, and decay constant of .024. For
an isolated dwelling in the mountains or on an island
unable to receive power from a local power company a
strontium battery may be feasible and desirable in the
future. Assuming a 33% efficiency could be reached in the
conversion of thermal energy into electrical and a fifteen
amp line were desired we would need 5400 watts of power
at 120 volts. This is twelve pounds of strontium-90.
Placing our decay constant and ten years into our equation
for percent power we show that e •°24x 10=79%. This large
of a battery is quite radioactive and must be shielded from
all life. A good shield would be rock or dirt. The battery
could be buried for its lifetime.
Detective Work
Neutron activation analysis is a very important tool. In
neutron activation analysis a sample of unknown is put into
a reactor. In the reactor's high neutron flux some of the
sample's elements absorb neutrons and some of the activated
atoms (those that have absorbed a neutron or two) become
unstable and decay. The decay process emits gamma rays.
These rays are distinctive for each element. In other words
the gamma ray energies form a type of fingerprint of the
material. This tool has been used in geology (analysis of
rock and soil), archeology (tools and various implements)
art (analysis of the composition of the masters' oil paints),
and surprisingly enough even criminology. Soil on suspect's
shoes may pin him to the geographical area of a crime, or
the analysis of a single hair on a criminal's clothi
tie him to the murder. And, amazingly, a small
of the surface of a suspect's skin (hand) will show
he fired a gun recently and if so how many times,
inner precision is possible with this type of
Radioactive tracers are important in biology
and medicine. Radioisotopes (radioactive isotopes)
chemically exactly the same as the stable isotopes. Iso:
tagged fertilizer was used in 1930 to determine the(*
phorus uptake of crops. In 1948 scientists at the Uniien
of California used tagged CO2 to determine that the o«n

compound. After a time a slice is taken from the am
and placed on an unexposed photographic plate, j

developing, the darker the film the more of the tag^
is concentrated in the area.
In medicine, the use of tracers is common. A he*
organ will take up certain minerals. Each organ has its 01

Too Little and Too Late?
BY: EDWIN BUTENHOF
Business &amp; Technical Personnel

Rochester, New York
Each year hundreds of thousands of college graduates
seek employment with industry. For many this means in-
terview after interview without success. Others are able to
choose among ten or more offers for industrial careers.
What's the difference? Those in the second group are not
necessarily brighter, nor are they necessarily more per-
sonable than those in the first group, but they do have
specific quantitative skills that industry feels are appro-
priate to its needs and which others lack.
I am not suggesting that the only goal of education is to
obtain a job — that must be an individual decision.
Neither am I suggesting that all jobs are in industry —
obviously government, retailing, banking, insurance, educa-
tion and many other areas seek college graduates. I am
suggesting that realistic counseling concerning the require-
ments of these various careers is often lacking.
College years can yield disappointing returns if career
counseling comes too late or comes from a base too narrow
for the formation of realistic employment goals. We in in-
dustry see the confusion daily as college graduates come to
us with academic backgrounds suited neither to our needs.
nor to their stated goals. Many students, of course, ha*n
listened even when counseling is offered; but eventua V,
they are faced with the realities of the job
The following focuses on industrial needs not
that's all there is, but because that's the segment IJ
familiar with. I feel there is a crying need for « ^
counseling which focuses on the real world of H
employment requirements. If some decide they a
interest in industry and, therefore, choose not o
those requirements - fine, that's their choice; but a
they should have the facts. This counseling shouldpru|dbe
any student decision on course majors and mpu
provided by teachers, guidance counselors, pare
dustry itself, throughout high school and college. ^ ^
One of my sons, who thinks he might want to^
dentist, is, at my suggestion, majoring in chemi ^
than pre-dentistry because I know his options ^
chemistry degree are far broader than with a P'e
degree. Those options will include dental schoo
still interested and if he qualifies. Another of ^
taking electrical engineering rather than mat
reasons.
All too often in our experience, recruiters
default career counselors to graduating studen •
come that far with no employment objective
Michigan^""


ars usually seek students about to graduate in engin-
g, chemistry, computer science, and quantitative busin-
&lt;^ few liberal arts majors can still find career paths with
sales, but quantitative demands are increasing steadily
lat field, as well. When our recruiters are approached,
jxample, by pre-dentistry majors seeking positions in
strial administration, they can only explain why their
ground is insufficient and suggest alternate career
s. Such counseling is, unfortunately, rather late,
ounseling must start as soon as the student begins to
choices. In many high schools today, a student can get
with perhaps one course in mathematics and earn a
ama. Counselors, however, should encourage students
take as much mathematics and science as they can
die so that they have as wide a choice as possible when
ege majors and career directions are chosen. Should they
go on to college, a strong math background would
ble them to pursue valuable apprenticeship and tech-
il school courses. Without math, many career options are
ady closed to the high school graduate.
I believe industry will be willing to participate with
ools in the counseling role if the schools are open to
; participation. In Rochester, for example, Kodak
ers programs in which students and their teachers are
ited to spend time talking with company representatives
Dut our needs. We spend time on college campuses to
cuss our company and its staffing needs with placement
ficers and faculty. Whenever possible, we comply with
quests from student groups for tours and discussions.
Because they have the day-to-day contact, however, the
iools must take the initiative to see that students receive
rrect information on the business world. Incorrect infor-
ation is readily available. The newspapers tell us, for
ample, that engineering graduates encounter sweeping
cles of demand and thereby discourage enrollments,
hile it is true that demands for engineers are higher some
sars than others, it is also true that even in "poor" years,
igineers have been in greater demand than any other
ichelor's degree holder.
I have had discussions with professors in some fields
ho are very proud if 30 percent of their students get jobs
Hated to their college training. Engineering professors, I
link, would be very concerned if less than 90 percent of
leir students were so hired. I personally would be sur-
rised if more than ten percent of history graduates get jobs
1 their field.
At Kodak, we will hire perhaps one of every 80 chemical
ngineering graduates in the United States each year. At
he other extreme, we will hire perhaps one of every 17,000
iberal arts graduates that same year. The contrast, I think,
s striking as an illustration of supply and demand.
Graduates of liberal arts programs often feel that in-
justry should hire tham because they are having a tough
time finding a job and because they are bright. They might
better have found out early what training is really needed
for industrial jobs, since they are competing with others,
equally bright, but better prepared. Liberal arts majors
are often said to excell in communications skill, leadership,
persistence, tact, ability to learn, etc. What is not well
understood even by many counselors is that for industry
these things are not sufficient by themselves. We also need
technical knowledge relevant to industrial problem solving.
To say it another way, industry needs broadly trained
people who can tackle a variety of jobs. I may differ from
educators, however, in my definition of "broadly." In my
opinion, no one today can be classed as "broadly trained"
who has no knowledge of engineering problem solving; no
knowledge of computers, of science, or of finance. Breadth
also includes knowledge of philosophy, history, writing and
speaking; but our experience shows that a bright, well-
motivated individual with the right technical knowledge can
pick up the latter knowledge by experience and self-study
on the job. The reverse, unfortunately, is rarely true.
From the starting point of a technical job, employees
may grow in specialized technical knowledge and become
technical experts of managers of technical work. As an
alternative, they may become more general and grow more
toward staff or administrative work. It is often these people
who later fill more generalized jobs in industrial relations,
public relations, advertising, training, and the like, since
their technical knowledge and company experience give
them an advantage over the new liberal arts graduates for
that work.
Because many students do not have clearly defined goals
when they begin college, it seems wise to me to keep the
options open as long as possible. This can be done by
earning the most quantitative degree the individual can han-
dle regardless of the ultimate objective. One can easily
become less quantitative in the course of a career and many
do, but moving the other way is difficult.
Incidentally, I wouldn't expect a job-seeking student
to be able to tell me where his or her background would
fit at Kodak. But I would expect students seeking careers
with our company to have examined themselves and their
goals as objectively as possible.
As an illustration, a graduate recently asked me for a job
in sales. Unfortunately, he did not have the personal capa-
bilities necessary to work with people. He didn't even want
to travel! This demonstrated to me a complete lack of self-
analysis. It is equally unrealistic for those who can't
communicate with others to want to be managers or for
those with poor scientific achievement to aim for a position
in research. Counselors who are knowledgeable about job
requirements can help students be realistic in their goals.
Teachers and guidance officers are the ones who can
reach the students early when important choices are being
made. If they wish to ask industry for information and
assistance, I feel sure industry will respond. It's sad to see a
student realize that four years have been spent in obtaining
a degree not relevant to his or her career goals. It happens
too often.
February 1977


Over the years attempts have been made to correct the
sight of individuals with a lens that fits into the eye which,
for all intents, is invisible to others. Until recently the
contact lens has had some serious drawbacks. As the
result, a vast majority of the weak eyed people in the
world continued to wear what were often unattractive eye
glasses. Today a new type of contact lens is available that
allows more people to enjoy the greater comfort of contact
lenses. This is the soft contact lens, a pliable lens which is
easier on the eye than its hard, more conventional counter-
part.
Even though contact lenses have only been important in
optometry in the last twenty years, they date back to the
times of Leonardo da Vinci who first put the concept on
paper. Their first application is attributed to a German glass
eye maker, F.A. Malter, who used them to cover the
eyes of people who had damaged corneas. These first
contact lenses had no corrective capabilities and were only
for protection from dirt and infection. In the 1940's and
50's they were made of a hard plastic which could be
ground like a conventional lens to correct for sight impair-
ments. Then, in the mid 1960's, the development of a clear
spongy plastic made possible the first soft contact lens.
Today they are classified as a drug for reasons presented
later.
The soft contact lens is a disk of water absorbant clear
plastic that conforms to the surface of the cornea. The
material is hard when dry, but when brought into contact
with the persons' own eye fluids becomes soft and pliable.
A common material is hydroxyethl methacrylate which
can absorb up to 38.6% of its own weight in fluids. Another
is a polymeric combination of the above and polyvinyl
pryolidine which absorbs 55% of its own weight in fluids.
These lenses are slightly larger than the hard lens.
The softness of these lenses produces several advantages.
First of all is comfort, which is greatly increased with the use
of the soft lens. There are no irritating sharp edges to
scratch the eyes. The soft lenses fit more snugly because
they conform to surface variations of the eye. This helps
prevent dust particles from being admitted under the lens.
Secondly, they require only a minor break-in time, while
hard lenses sometimes require months. Third, because of
the right fit, they are less likely to fall out of the eye. This
is attractive to participants of contact sports such as
football. Fourth is longer wearing times. The pliability
of the soft lens makes possible wearing it for almost a 24
hour period. Another advantage is increased side visibility.
The lens covers the entire cornea so a person can see to the
by Bill Oori
side better than with conventional eye glasses.
The tight fit and absorbant capabilities of soft lenas
have led to several medical applications. First of all, tte
can be used as a corneal bandage to fight abrasion w':
protect delicate tissues in a corneal transplant. Seam*.
their absorbant capabilities have found wide spread use«
applying medicine for extended times to the cornea for
example, in the case of glaucoma, the lens is soaked i
philocarpine (which it absorbs), is placed on the cone.
and the medicine is thus released into the eye. Finerexib
have been accomplished in this area. Excessive cornea!
dryness and ulcers of the cornea have also been treated
successfully by this technique. Because of these applications
the FDA in 1968 classified soft contact lenses as a druj
which means only a licensed optha/mologist can prescribe
them.
Of course, with any new development there are certain
disadvantages that come with the advantages. There as
three major ones: corrective capability, ease and cost of use.
and contamination. Corrective capability rs severely limited
by its design; the soft lens can only correct for nearsighted
ness. Farsightedness requires a lens which is thick m
center and thin at the edges. As a result of the pliability
of the soft lens the thin edges tend to fold under«
wrinkle when the wearer blinks, blurring vision or*»
falling out as gaps form at the folds. Secondly, becauset«
lens must be molded instead of ground they cannot^
made to the exact specifications of the eye shape. Pre
five basic lenses are made with varying degrees of co
power. A person must accept the closest power, wni

, eye irritations. Proteins also tend to adhere to the
i causing some infections while oils and atomized
i tend to attack the surface and cloud it. If cleaning
and sterilization procedures are carefully observed these
problems are minimized and infections are rare.
Overall the soft contact lens rates last behind conventional
glasses and hard lenses for vision correction. The majority of
today's users do so for greater comfort and for cosmetic
reasons,ignoring the inconvenience and limitations for these
reasons.

Future Plans

intercomputer communication services it offers.
has been learned through experience from opera-
te network thus leading to improvements simplifying
user's control of network resources, speeding data
fers. and expanding the range of network capabilities.
ie existing three university network is only an initial
toward the establishment of a more complete statewide
2r education network. The remaining four year in-
tions were added to MICIS in 1973 and if MERIT
ces follow this same expansion, more students, teachers
researchers throughout the state will have access to
network at a reasonable cost. This expansion of the
vork will provide modern, sophisticated resources to
;e who previously would have foregone such needed
efits.
\t present, MERIT has the commitment from three state
ported universities to join the network upon obtaining
■ansion funding. These are Central Michigan University,
rthern Michigan University, and Western Michigan Uni-
sity. The implication of their commitment is that once
y become active members of the network, they must
ire in the operational expenses. Other members of
CIS have expressed interest in joining the network, but
i delaying any commitment until they can fully determine
»ir exact computing needs.
There are four basic ways to expand MERIT network
rvices to other colleges and univeristies (see Figure 3).
Direct Access
Other institutions may tie into the network through one
: the host computing centers. For example, Oakland
niversity and other Detroit area community colleges
ave gained such direct access to MERIT through Wayne
tate University's computing center. This type of access
jquires no additional equipment, but the user is required
a pay the usual rate for host and network services.
Additional Communications Computers
Institutions possessing large host computers can enter
he network after acquiring their own communication
:omputers. For example. Central Michigan University and
Western Michigan University, both committed to joining
MERIT upon acquisition of expansion funding, will enter
the network in this manner.
Network Satellite Computer
For institutions having limited local computing capacity
and/or those too far removed from the current hosts to
obtain convenient direct access, a network satellite com-
puter is proposed. The satellite computer differs from a
communications computer in that it will not have a local
host connection. Rather, it will serve users directly via
terminals, a card reader, and a printer. For example.
Northern Michigan University would function ideally in
this fashion. Upon obtaining expansion funding, Northern
Michigan University if committed to acquire a satellite
computer to enter the MERIT network.
Interconnection to Other Computer Networks
Along with the expanding resources the Telenet inter-
connection may bring, a similar TYMNET interconnection
could also prove valuable. TYMNET is also a commercial
network, considerably more established than Telenet,
serving seventy-five cities in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, and
Europe. TYMNET provides access both to its own company's
Tymshare hosts and to about thirty others, such as the
Cornell University computer and Stanford's Artificial In-
telligence and Library Management systems.
"The development of a highspeed, bilateral internetwork
tie represents a challenging technical development that
offers substantial long-term rewards." As a note of interest,
MERIT participates in a committee concerned with in-
ternational internetwork standards called the International
Network Group, whose members come from thirteen
countries.

The following conglomeration of award winning quotes
was drawn from the January 1927 issue of Technic.
This first one is the winner of the Earl Butz Great Tact
Award.
"Do not worry too much about what our contemporary
sociologists are deploring, machinery is not making morons,
but it is helping morons to make a decent living."
The Archie Bunker Social Progress award goes to the
following.
"Once we had a great movement called "Welfare Work.'
That word welfare has been expunged f rorn the dictionary.
As the chemists would say, it was too labile."
The Richard Nixon "We did it for your own good"
Award was won by this next one.
"We (the older generation) think our fathers left a mess
for us. We were sure we had the goods on them. You
(the younger generation) will think we are leaving a mess for
you to clean up, but, confidentially, if the old folks had not
left something for us we would have been very sore. They
gave us our opportunity. We are giving you yours, and
plenty of it."
The Jimmy "The Greek" Crystal Ball Award belongs to
the author of the following.
"... at the present time the United States had a surplus
of oil and is producing much more than its requirements.
There cannot be a shortage of motor fuel for centuries to
come when one takes into consideration the supply of
crude petroleum, tar sands, coal, oil shale, and wood tars."
The Godfather "So what if he stepped on a few people?"
Award is given to this next brilliant quote.
"The wealth, tremendous as it was, which society gave
to Mr. Rockefeller, was infinitesimal compared to the
benefits society received when his genious so organized the
distribution of kerosene oil that during the latter part of the
last century, in cities, on the farms, in the far distant
corners of the earth, the kerosene lamp vanished the hours
of darkness with which the world had been imprisoned
and gave the ambitious boy the time and opportunity to
improve himself."
The "Where would you be without me?" modesty
Award goes to the elitest who wrote the following.
"... the college trained man and woman are the saviors
of human society."

Dear Sir:
Thank you for your interest in me during your recent visit to my campus. I always enjoy interviewing-the
wrestling match at 7:30 in the morning to get signed up after waiting an hour to be tenth in line,skips
the class I'm getting a D in to get dressed up in my monkey suit just to talk to you, and then getting a flff
letter three months later. Yessir, interviewing has to be one of the most fun things I do, right up therewith
sharpening pencils.
Unfortunately, after carefully reviewing your company's qualifications, I have come to the conclusion that
you are a bunch of jerks. And as far as working for your company, I believe I would rather be a sharecroppe'
or even a waiter in a sorority. Thus it is with a certain amount of nasty pleasure that I inform you that my
employment interests lie elsewhere — like as far away from your scuzzy company as I can get.
However, I don't mean to give the impression that everything about your company is bad. As a matter of
fact, some things even rather impressed me. For instance, I did notice that your interviewer used a handker-
chief to pick his nose, which I thought was very tasteful considering the company for which he works. And
I'm sure the Salvation Army appreciates the business he does with them when buying his clothes.
I also noticed some rather encouraging things on a more company-wide basis. For instance, I just noticed tna
your stock rose 3 points to a new high of 5 on the NYSE. It's too bad, though, that your president and
board of directors who died in the plane crash could not see the rise which, ironically, happened the day
after their tragic demise. But I'm sure that this recent upswing reflects the confidence of both of your stoc
holders that the company will be even better managed than before by Ms. Kit E. Litter, former secretary
the president and now acting president.
I was further impressed by your employee bonus plan. I'm sure all of your workers appreciated thesix-p
they were able to buy with that generous bonus.
But on the whole, let's just say that our interests don't quite coincide. Better luck next time, fellas, an
an elephant caress you with his toes.
Yours,

... and then you accept your best offer
and embark on a dignified career.
That used to be the general idea.
Today college may have to be its own reward,
distantly related, if at all, to the problem of
earning a living.
There are exceptions, and as an engineering
graduate you are a prime exception.
In the eyes of the kind of people who run
outfits like Kodak, a B.S. or M.S. in
engineering marks you as a potential
successor of theirs.
Your attractiveness depends on the fact that
your engineering faculty, despite its apparent
friendliness, is out to make things as tough as
they can for you. Yet you SURVIVE!
When the business cycle is up, bare survival
in a rugged engineering curriculum may prove
sufficiently impressive. When it's down, the
bare survivors may find the pickings a little
better than their less technically minded friends
and a little slimmer than they are for the
hotshot who keeps a 3.9 GPA while running
a fleet of garbage trucks in order to support
honorable parents.
If we don't snare that character, it's probably
because an employer almost as desirable as
we are got there first.
To prevent that, waste no time before

engineers who were
born to lead.
Are you the kind of engineer who has what it takes to move into management someday?
If you are, you already know it.
Now what you need to know is which companies can offer you the best oppor-
tunities. We think you'll find General Electric is one.
We're a high technology company. And that means we have to have manag-
ers who understand technology-women and men-to run the place.
Today, over 60% of the top managers at General Electric hold technical
degrees. In fact, over 65% of the college graduates we hired last year held
technical degrees.
Of course, just leadership ability and a technical degree won't get
you into management. First, you're going to need solid engineering
experience and a broad understanding of business.
And we have a lot of ways to help you get it.
One is our Manufacturing Management Program. A two-year
program of rotating assignments that gives you broad experience
with different products and manufacturing processes.
Another is our Engineering Program. For engineers with an
interest in product and systems design and development.
There's also a Field Engineering Program, a Technical Market-
ing Program, plus a number of programs sponsored by product
operations.

Dick Dent's job was made in Belgium.
Dick and his family live at 2905
Phillips St. in South Charleston,
West Virginia.
He works just ten minutes away
at the local Union Carbide plant.
But his job was created thousands
of miles away.
You see, Dick's job is to make spe-
cial chemicals called catalysts.
These catalysts are shipped to
Belgium and other countries where
Union Carbide plants depend on
them to make petrochemicals that
are sold abroad.
This interdependence is not un-
usual in the countries where Union
Carbide and its affiliates work.
By manufacturing abroad we have
actually increased the foreign
demand for many products we make
here at home.
This in turn has created more jobs
here at home. A recent study shows
our investment overseas has directly
created at least 2,500 jobs in our
plants in the U.S.
Still, we manufacture abroad only
when it becomes unfeasible to supply
and maintain a market from the U.S.
In fact, we export products from
America to 100 foreign countries."
All of which is another way of say-
ing that our international investment
is helping improve the standard of
living for people abroad and at home.
Including Dick Dent and his
family.

"he past winter has forced us all to once again face
to the hard realities of an energy shortage. It is as if
ire has given us a second warning; some day our
ent energy resources are going to run out. The sooner
face that fact the better off we will be. This month
hnic has decided to examine the current energy
lation.
We have divided our treatment into two areas. The first
concerned with the technology of energy production, its
rrent status, and where it is likely to go. Bill Cowie's
:icle "Energy Technology Alternatives for the Future"
als with this subject. Bill is a Junior in Aerospace
lgineering.
The second area of concern is the politics of energy. To a
eat extent our energy situation depends on what Washing-
rn decides to do about it. Ray Barry investigates what has
jen done or has not been done and why in his article
Energy Politics 1976".
Within the last six months a somewhat unofficial ban on
iNA research has slowly lifted. A number of research
rganizations, including the University of Michigan, have set
afety standards and are carefully starting up recombinant
)NA research laboratories. The benefits of such research
could be astounding, yet so could any resulting calamity.
Its another example of the dilemma a modern science:
risk vs. benefits. This is the subject of Mark DesCamp's
article "The DNA Controversy: Science can be Hazardous
to Your Health".
One of the most crucial issues in an age of nuclear
weapons proliferation is the issue of weapons verification.
Verification is the cornerstone of any practical arms
limitation agreement. It will necessarily be the building
block for future world safety and security. Steve Stathos
discusses the complexities of this subject in his article
"Verification: Key to Arms Control".
In a more bizarre state of mind Steve decided to write
another article revealing some little known facts about the
history of aviation. Unfortunately he actually wrote it.
However, not to be accused of. censorship, we decided
to run it anyway. He calls it "The Grover Cleveland
Effect." We think it qualifies Steve for the hot air award.
Not to be outdone by Steve's "humor", Ray Barry
reprints the results of a survey taken in 1952 in "50 and 25
Years Ago." The survey dealt with the question; "What
do you think of women in engineering?" There were some
interesting reactions.

March 1977


by Bill Cowie
Unless you have spent the past decade in the jungles
of Lower Zambiziland, I am sure you are well aware of the
fact that the citizens of this planet are currently facing a
problem which has become known as the energy crisis. I
don't plan to bore you with a discussion of whether or not
it really is a crisis, whether it is real or contrived, et cetera.
Rather, I would like to take a look beyond the immediate
problems of supply and demand to the long term problem.
That problem is this: An increasing per capita consumption
of energy on top of a growing human population means
that the rate of world wide energy consumption at the end
of this century will probably be somewhere between Sand
10 times the current rate, and growing exponentially. The
primary sources of energy currently being used will not be
able to keep up this increased demand indefinitely. Sooner
or later, we are not going to be able to get enough coal, oil,
natural gas, uranium, or other source of fuel, unless we are
willing to incur higher costs and further damage to an already
wounded environment. Therefore, new sources of energy
simply must be found. The currently proposed sho-1 term
"solutions" - bringing in oil from Alaska, increasing ex-
ploration for natural gas, mining more coal, and so on •*
simply temporary postponements to give us more time
search for answers to the long term problem.
There are several requirements, then, for a viable
term energy source. First, this energy must be derived'
a virtually inexhaustible source. (Remember, we are
sidering a time when the rate of energy consumP"0"
be many times what it is today). Second, the Process°
obtaining and processing it (i.e. converting it to a usi
form of energy) and the by-products of using it must ha*(
negligible impact on the earth's environment. •&gt;•
must be inexpensive enough in its useful form to co
with other sources. Let's look at some of the P™"1"1
ideas for alternative energy sources, to see how we
meet these requirements.
First, there is nuclear fusion, the process by
which th«
sun produces its power. The idea of fusion powe
imitate the sun, but on a much smaller scale. Asma
i
of fusionable material is heated to nearly l
Michigan


degrees, so that the nuclei are able to move fast enough to
overcome their mutual repulsion and fuse. But at these
temperatures, there is enormous pressure, which must be
contained, so that the nuclei are kept close enough to
interact. Obtaining these pressures' - for instance, by
magnetic confinement — has proven very difficult. But this
problem can be overcome by using a different process, laser
fusion. The laser fusion process involved coating the pellet
of hydrogen fuel with a special plastic "driving layer". The
laser beam is then split and diffracted by mirrors, so that a
single pulsed beam converges evenly on the pellet from all
sides. This causes the outer layer to evaporate instantly,
producing a rocket-like reaction on the pellet, squeezing
it inward, until it is less than 1/1000 its original size. This
enormous pressure causes the pellet to heat up to fusion
temperatures and explode, like a miniature hydrogen bomb.
The fusion energy could then be converted to heat by a
liquid metal blanket lining the inside of an explosion
chamber, no bigger than 10 feet in diameter. Theoretically,
the fusion-induced explosion should release about 50 times
as much energy as it receives from the laser beam.
At the present time, though, there are 3 problems. The
first is that a laser which is both powerful enough and
efficient enough to do the job described above has not yet
been built. Our most powerful lasers only have an efficiency
of about 1%. But laser technology is still relatively young
and rapidly developing. The second problem involves the
fuel pellets. These tiny, multi-layered spheres must be well
designed so that they will work properly. Yet they must
also be able to be cheaply mass produced. Otherwise,
laser fusion will not be able to compete economically with
other energy sources. The third problem, which probably
will be the most difficult to overcome, involves the fabrica-
tion of a material which can withstand the neutron bom-
bardment confined within the inner reactor. The materials
developed so far have not been able to withstand the high
speed neutron bombardment for a sufficient period of time.
But there are several advantages to laser fusion power.
Firs* the primary fuel used is virtually inexhaustible. It
March 1977


can be obtained rather easily and cheaply, without polluting
the atmosphere or damaging the landscape, and it can not
be controlled by any cartel. The fuel is deuterium, an
isotope of hydrogen, and is found in water at a concentra-
tion of about one part in several thousand. Second, the
laser fusion does not give off radioactive waste products.
The initial reaction gives off radioactive tritium, but
tritium itself is a good fusion fuel, which can be recycled
and used as fuel. The final waste products are 2 harmless
isotopes of helium.
Thus, assuming the technological problems can be
worked out, the easiest approach would be to convert the
conventional coal - and oil - fired furnaces to laser fusion
reactors, and continue to use the steam turbine process to
convert heat into electricity. But there is still one problem
with this. Regardless of the original source of energy -
whether gas, coal, oil, fission, or fusion - the steam turbine
process itself is a very inefficient one. The average electric
generating plant throws away twice as much energy as it
converts into electricity. Almost all of it is in the form of
waste heat. Simply substituting a laser fusion reactor for a
furnace does not do anything toward solving the problem
of thermal pollution. Furthermore, as energy consumption
increases exponentially, so would the amount of waste heat.
One way to get around this problem is to convert the
fusion energy directly into electricity, a rather exotic
process which is currently under study but which appears
to be a long way from commercial feasibility.
Assuming an efficient process of this type can befoa
laser fusion would then meet all 3 of the stipulate;»
quirements - low cost, little environmental impact as
derived from a virtually inexhaustible source - and ak
become the primary energy source of the future. But 7*1
are still many years of work to be done before this add
become a reality.
Another virtually inexhaustible source of energyswd
power. Whenever wind power is mentioned, the first ttimj
most people think of is the windmill, which is current^
getting most of the attention in wind research. The Natron1
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and its Ik
S. Energy Research and Development AdministrationIERMI
are currently conducting joint research in windmill techno-
logy. One large windmill - a 100 kw, 125 foot diamra
structure - is currently being tested at the NASA-Lew
Research Center near Sandusky, Ohio, ERDA recrily
announced plans to build 2 more windmills, with a bis*
diameter of 200 feet, and an output of 1.5 megawatts. A
typical coal or oil fired electric generator produces seven1
hundred megawatts.) But conventional windmills app»
to have practical limits in terms of both size and po*»
output. In order for them to make a sizeable contributions
a source of energy, it appears that a very large number wouki
have to be built.
But this does not rule out wind power as a viable source
of energy, it just means that conventional windmills appe."
to be the wrong way to harness it.
Several other ideas have been proposed as alternate
methods of extracting energy from the wind. One such*
is a concept originally proposed in the 1930's by an engine*
from Detroit named Julius Madaras. It is called the Madaras
rotor power plant, and is currently being investigaw*
the University of Dayton Research Institute, with fundi"?
from ERDA. It involves an aerodynamic concept call*
the Magnus effect. Air flowing over a spinningobjectcreates
a powerful sideways propulsive force. (This is what ena
a baseball pitcher to throw a curve, by spinning
the ball as
he releases it.) The Madaras rotor is a tall, spinning cylin*
mounted on a flatbed railroad car placed on a c
circular track. As wind blows over the cylinder it pwu
a sideways force which propels the car around the ci
track. "The turning wheels on the railroad car would
electric generators, and the power would be collecw
third rail", says ERDA. It is possible that such a P°
plant; consisting of many cylinders and railroad cars
produce 100 megawatts of electrical power.
Perhaps a better idea is a novel concept I

y as it moves inward, the vortex becomes more intense
oves upward creating a vacuum at the bottom of the
just like a tornado. As it moves out the top, the
ig mass of air is met by the wind blowing over the
. This wind blows the top of the vortex away, and in
so, gives up energy to the system, enhancing the low
ire at the bottom. Meanwhile, at the bottom, am-
air from outside rushes into this low pressure area
gh a converging nozzle — something like an inverted
A. In the neck of this nozzle, right below the low
ure core of the vortex, would be a turbine, which would

turbine in turn would be connected to a generator.
; a major problem of conventional windmills — large
es — would no longer be a problem. This system
s the energy from a large mass of air and funnels it
a much smaller turbine. The hypothetical 20 story
ar would require a turbine less than 10 feet in diameter,
dn would be easier to design and build, and would be
e efficient than a conventional windmill. Furthermore,
Yen estimates that it might be able to produce 1 mega-
t of electricity at a cost of less than 3 cents per kW-hr,
y slightly higher than the current cost of electricity.
Mr. Yen also has a way to solve a serious question con-
nting any wind energy system. That is: What so you do
en tne wind dies down? He has demonstrated that a small
i at the base of the tower can sustain the vortex even in a
her gentle breeze. Furthermore, the fuel for this fire can
just about anything that burns, from low-grade coal to
bage.
There are still a number of obstacles which must be
irdled before such a system can be built. The most
noying one is that the large wind vortex would create
loud roar like a jet plane. Also, there are questions about
e stresses to which a large tower would be subjected,
ie environmental effects of the huge vortices that are
roduced, and economic considerations which may limit
ie size of the towers. Nevertheless, Mr. Yen remains opti-
listic that these problems can be worked out, and that
ie vortex systems of 100 megawatts or more can be
iuilt. ERDA recently announced a $200,000 contract
vith Grumman Aerospace to test this system on a small scale.
Hydrogen power is another source of energy which is
iurrently being investigated. Hydrogen is easily obtained by
iecomposing water. It burns easily, and gives off water vapor
as its only by-product. It is difficult to store, though, as it
must be kept at 423° below zero in a liquid state. But a
few years ago, 2 physicists, R.H. Wiswall and J.J. Reilly,
working with General Electric scientists, at the Brookhaven
National Laboratory, in Long Island, N.Y., developed a
more efficient means of storing hydrogen. After water has
been decomposed into hydrogen and oxygen gas, the
hydrogen is combined with magnesium powder, forming
magnesium hydride, which is also in a powder form. This
can then be decomposed when needed, to release hydrogen
gas. When all the hydrogen has been used, the remaining
magnesium powder can be recycled and used again to
store more hydrogen. Not only does the magnesium
hydride powder hold more hydrogen than an equivalent
volume of liquid hydrogen, but it also does not need to be
kept at very low temperatures.
NASA is currently testing this system with 4 prototype
trucks at the Jet Propulsion Laboratories, in Pasadena,
California. The magnesium hydride is stored in a metal
cassette attached to the underside of the vehicle, similar
to a gas tank. This same system can also be used to power
an automobile, with some minor modifications. Several
such autos are being tested by the Billings Energy Re-
search Corporation in Utah.
Most of the scientists who have tested this system or
worked with it agree that it is a practical method for cars
of the future. Here is an example of how it might work:
When your hydrogen powered car is low on fuel, you
would pull into a service station, which has a stock of
these cassettes on hand. The attendant simply removes the
used cassette and replaces it with a fully charged one,
doing this in about the same time it takes to fill a tank
with gasoline today. This new cassette could then power a
car for about 400 miles before needing a replacement,
while the old one is recharged and later used in another car.
But best of all, it is estimated that this system will cost less
than 1 cent per mile! Furthermore, the use of hydrogen
March 1977


would not be restricted to automobiles, but could be used
to power generators, and heat homes and industries, in
place of oil or natural gas.
But the greatest potential for hydrogen in a powder
form is that it provides a convenient method of storing
energy for use at a later time. This would help alleviate
a major problem of other forms of energy production,
which requires the energy to be produced right when and
where it is needed. For instance, it would be difficult to
use solar power to provide electricity for residential use.
It would be difficult to store enough electricity to last
through the night. Several cloudy days in a row would
be an even more serious problem. But by storing hydrogen
in this powder form, it can be produced practically any-
where, then shipped or stored, to be used whenever and
wherever it is needed.
Apparently, the only problem is the source of power
necessary to provide the initial energy to decompose the
water into hydrogen and oxygen. The most likely candi-
date so far is wind power; but the research continues.
Another potential alternative is magnetohydrodynamics,
or MHD for short. MHD is a method for converting heat
directly into electricity, without any intermediate steps.
The theory behind it has been understood for almost 150
years. But, as usual, it has proven difficult and expensive to
put into practice.
Basically the idea is this: A partially ionized, burning gas,
at a temperature of 5000°C or more, is passed through a
duct lined with electrodes, in a magnetic field. At this
high temperature, the gas is in a highly conductive plasma
state. The movement of this gas through the magnetic field
induces an electric current, which is drawn off by the
electrodes. An efficiency of 50 to 60% is believed to be
possible, as opposed to the 30 to 40% achieved by nuclear or
coal fired generators. It is also a much simpler system, as
there are no moving parts, and it gives off less effluents
and waste heat than conventional generators.
The drawbacks, however, are numerous. First, a large
magnetic field is a necessity for large scale energy produc-
tion. Superconducting magnets currently appear to be the
best answer, but there is still the need for bigger magnets.
Second, the electrodes, and the duct through whidi
gases pass must be able to withstand the heat, corrosion
erosion of the MHD generator. The best materials«
so far have lasted only a few hours. And third, even tin
MHD has a much higher efficiency, it still uses fossilfi
(Coal is the most likely candidate.)
Currently, the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. are cooperating
research in MHD. The Soviet Union currently leads
world in MHD technology, (due to the inactivity of
U.S. in the 1960's) but the U.S. is the leader in the si*
conducting magnet; hence the symbiosis. Although jo
research in continuing, the U.S. is spending comparatii
little for its own research in this area.
The sun, of course, can be considered a truly inexlw
ble source of energy. I am sure at one time or another f
have heard the figures on how much longer the sun«
continue to burn, and what an enormous amount of enen
it releases every second. But collecting a sufficient fracr/c
of this energy and converting it into a usable form is not!
easy task, especially when you consider that we are rm
100 million miles from the source. Nevertheless, itapf&gt;«'
to be a very promising idea.
The most desireable method is the conversion of sunligh
directly to electricity. This is not something which ws
only recently discovered possible. In fact, it was
discovery -that bits of light energy can be transformedm
the kinetic energy of an electron - which led Einstein tc

lductors. Then, last September, came a breakthrough
j nember 30, ERDA reported that "Scientist at the
&gt;ity of Delaware have achieved a new level of
icy in solar cells made of considerably less expen-
laterials than solar cells currently in use." These
re made of cadmium sulfide and copper sulfide,
ave an efficiency of almost 8%. The materials used
ike these cells cost $1.12 per square meter, as
id to $1 50.00 per square meter for single crystal
i cells. An efficiency of about 10% or more should be
able by 1980.
"anwhile, a completely different approach is quietly
studied. It is a process called photoelectrochemistry,
s somewhat similar to the operation of an ordinary
ry, except that sunlight is the original source of
IV, instead of a chemical reaction. Light falls on one
rode, freeing electrons, while the other electrode is
arkness. Connecting the electrodes allows the freed
rons to flow to the dark electrode, where they combine
the ions in a surrounding electrolyte. This flow of
Irons, of course, is an electric current. Although this
xss is less efficient than a photovoltaic cell, it may
possible to produce them more cheaply. But more
ortant, hydrogen is given off during this process, thus
&lt;ing photoelectrochemistry a possible candidate for
production of hydrogen to be converted to hydride
/vder, as discussed earlier.
We have now looked at 5 methods of energy production:
Jrfusion, wind power, hydrogen, megnetohydrodynamics,
1 solar power. Let's compare these five methods to see
w well they meet the requirements stipulated at the
ginning of this article, taking into consideration the
vantages and disadvantages posed by each.
MHD is a much better way of converting the energy
fossil fuels into a usable form — electricity. It would be
Jat if we were able to use it today, as it would con-
lerably reduce our current need for fossil fuels. (Indeed,
'■ might have been much closer to a viable MHD
ocess today. It received much research attention
the early 1960's, but due to the mirage of cheap
•ergy — as a result of regulated prices — it was deemed
lworthy of further study.) However, MHD can not be
msidered a viable alternative unless a source other than
&gt;ssil fuels can be found.
Laser fusion holds much potential. It easily passes the
rst requirement, for we have seen that it's source is simply
rater. But in order to pass the second requirement, a way
5 circumvent the inherent inefficiencies of steam powered
Wat'ion must be found. This adds still another tech-
ological hurdle to the list. Unless there is a breakthrough
n the near future, it might be difficult for laser fusion
o achieve the necessary low cost.
Wind power can easily meet the first and second require-
TOnts. It is clean, and is derived from an inexhaustible
source. But it is probably not feasible, esthetically or
economically, to decorate the countryside with convention-
al windmills. Only recently has serious research begun
on the other two concepts, the Madaras rotor, and the
wind vortex tower, and it is much too early to deter-
mine the feasibility of either method.
Hydrogen, in a magnesium hydride powder form, not
only passes all 3 requirements, but also has a further
advantage which the others lack, that is, it can easily
be stored and transported. The problem is that unlike
wind or solar power, where you simply build something
and start collecting its energy, the production of hydrogen
requires an outside source. Hopefully, this will not prove to
be an insurmountable barrier.
Finally, solar power holds a great deal of potential,
simply due to the virtually limitless power of the sun. It
is a clean, free source of energy, and its cost should be
low enough by the end of the next decade to make it
competitive with energy from fossil fuels.
So what will be the source of energy in the 21st cen-
tury? Will there be one primary source, or several con-
tributing sources? Or perhaps something totally differ-
ent will come along, making these methods appear poor in
comparison. (We can always hope.) The unpredictable
forces of technology and politics make it nearly impossible
to make any meaningful prediction. But it appears in-
evitable that the methods of energy production will
soon undergo a major transformation.
March 1977


Energy Politics 1976
by Ray Barry
Typical of an election year, 1976 produced a lot of
talk and little action. This was especially true concerning
energy issues. In fact, most experts agree there has been
little significant progress toward the government's pro-
claimed goal of energy independence since the Arab oil
embargo of 1973. Government leaders have floundered in
debate, indecision, and a lack of a sense of urgency. Con-
sequently the US still has no cohesive energy policy.
Meanwhile foreign imports continue to rise and natural
gas shortages are shutting down American industry. Two
consecutive mild winters, a slow economy and higher
fuel prices have allowed the U.S. to ignore the energy
situation since the end of the embargo. A continued
economic growth is expected to increase the demand for
energy. Government experts fear that if the demand grows
too fast — before the oil starts flowing from the North
Slope of Alaska and from the new British wells in the
North Sea, - supplies could become tight and prices rise.
It's not that the oil isn't there, it's just not available.
Saudi Arabia, for example, has a total capability of over
eleven million bbl. per day, but refuses to raise production
anywhere near that in order to stretch out their supplies.
Bad to Worse
The facts are hard and glaring. Since October 1973 U.S.
dependence on OPEC oil has increased from eleven to over
eighteen percent of the total consumption. Reliance o
imports of all kinds has risen from thirty-four to forty*6
percent, making the U.S. very vulnerable. During this saw
period our own production has continued to deci
pite an increase in onshore drilling activity. AH o

Iders, and univerisites were awarded funds for their own
ojects.
Nuclear Bans
On January 15 California was the center of one of the
-nost controversial state wide elections of the year. The
issue was banning nuclear power plants. The issue was de-
feated by a huge margin. Anti-nuclear proponents com-
plained it was because the power companies spent more
money on campaigning. The decision was a resounding
milestone nonetheless. In June a host of other states
followed California's lead and turned down the ban.
In another novel piece of legislation California put a ban
on natural gas heaters for swimming pools. Evidently a more
accentuated problem in California.
What to Expect From Carter
On the top of Carter's list has been a proposal to unite
all energy related activities and organizations into a single
cabinet office. Just when he will get around to it no one
knows, but when he does it will require Congressional
approval. That could be an agonizingly slow process.
Unlike Ford, Carter puts the emphasis on energy con-
servation and believes government must set an example.
He has already begun to set an example, the question is,
how long will he continue to?
In the area of transportation. Carter has proposed inte-
grated mass transit systems. His suggestion is that the
highway trust fund be converted to a transportation trust
fund so the funds could be used to develop mass transit
systems.
In the realm of nuclear power, President Carter believes
that there is too much emphasis on the breeder reactor. He
would like to see increased safety of nuclear power plants
with a Federal officer at every plant capable of shutting it
down if he feels something is wrong.

gressional legislation preventing the sale of Alaska oil out-
side the country.
So Who Cares?
The sluggishness of Americans, to respond to the energy
crisis is probably due to the fact that no urgency is felt.
In fact many Americans fail to believe there is any crisis at
all. Having adjusted to higher gas prices things go on as
before. One of the most blatant examples of this spirit are
Chicago's Commonwealth Edison television commercials
urging customers to leave house lights turned on when they
are gone to prevent burglaries.
Americans have become so accustomed to the new oil
and gas prices that they have returned to purchasing the
large gas guzzling monstrosities Detroit calls luxury cars.
Small car dealers have resorted to cash rebates, free color
TVs and other assorted gimmicks to convince the public to
purchase the smaller cars.
A three year study financed by the Energy Research and
Development Administration cited three major hinderances
to energy progress in the U.S.: 1) lack of Federal funds, 2)
absence of tax incentives to encourage conservation and 3)
the reluctance of industry to finance research. Furthermore,
it will be at least ten years before any new technology
could even begin to made a dent in the energy budget. This
becomes obvious when one looks at the lag times for
development of new sources. A new coal mine takes four
to six years to bring to full production. The same is true
for an off shore oil field. A nuclear reactor takes ten
years, and any type of new technology must be expected to
take as long.
ERDA's study also shows that almost all corporation
research is being done with government funds and involve
systems using, depleteable resources. Furthermore, there are
three technologies with immediate capabilities not being
utilized: 1) industrial waste heat, 2) solar home heat, 3)
trash-to-energy. Although some argue against waste-to-energy
technology in fears that we will become dependent on pro-
ducing excessive waste.
Howard Kauffman, President of Exxon Corp. blames
America's sluggishness on the democratic system, It is
difficult under a democratic system to get a consensus
and action in areas that require tough decisions. Example
Congress.
Congressional Action
The first major piece of energy legislation to be passed
by congress in recent history was the Energy Act of 1975.
It was signed by President Ford on December 22,1975 and
contained the following provisions.
It gives the President authority to create a strategic oil
reserve to be ready in case of emergency. However, at the
end of 1976 little had been done to implement this provision.
Also included in the Energy Act was a formula for
price controls on domestic crude oil extending for forty
months, a provision giving the Administration the authority
to order large consumers of natural gas and oil to convert to
coal and the authority to stipulate oil sharing emergent,
and rationing, it set mandatory auto efficiency standards,
and requires appliance manufacturers to label their product:
indicating energy efficiency.
No one could consider the Energy Act of 1975 a cohe-
sive national energy policy, but it was a start. Passing energy
legislation has proved exceedingly difficult. One of the
reasons is that there has been a coalition of Congressmen
opposing it for a various number of reasons. Among the
list of reasons are opposition to big business, opposition to
big government, opposition to the nationalization of the
energy industry, and some environmental objections. Bui
alas, some legislation has begun to appear.
On March 4 House and Senate conferees readied an
agreement on a Bill supported by President Ford to allow
three of four Naval Oil Reserves to be put into Ml
production. The oil reserves were created in the early part of
the century to provide fuel for Navy ships in the event of
war. One of these (Teapot Dome, Wyoming) created a
scandal during President Harding's Administration when it
was discovered government officials were receiving pay-
ments for leasing oil rights. These reserves have teen re-
placed with more convenient ones.
A big debate arose in June when Congress was scheduled
to determine the fate of the Federal Energy Administration
(F.E.A.). The F.E.A. was created in 1973 to administer the
distribution of oil and gas during the Arab Oil Embargo.
Since then it has taken on the task of enforcing pn«
controls, creating the strategic reserve, developing advice for
the president, developing conservation plans, and developing
emergency plans. The F.E.A. was scheduled to die on July
31.
Both the House and the Senate voted to extend th&lt;
of the agency not because anyone thought the Agency wa
doing a good job, simply because no one knew who ww
perform its responsibilities such as creation of the 01 r
serves if it were killed. There is no love lost between tj
F.E.A. and Congress. At one point last year a group"
Democratic Senators proposed the creation of an ener ^
statistics agency as an arm of Congress to collect a a

rtal communities to develop offshore oil fields. It included
its and guaranteed loans to help communities cope with
problems involved. The money can be used for road
irovements, building new schools, new sewer systems,
ansion, etc. It also provides that the oil companies must
form to local environmental standards, putting control
:he hands of the local community.
It would be impossible to accurately list all of the legisla-
n, however the following list represents some of the
ire important legislative acts.
Energy conservation standards have been set for new
nstruction and renovated buildings.
9.7 billion was allocated for energy research and water
d power projects for fiscal 1977.
Funds for setting up state educational campaigns to
ach conservation were allotted.
Tax incentives for individuals and businesses to insulate
id take conservation measures were passed.
Loan guarantees were given to small businesses, non-profit
rganizations, and local governments converting to solar
nergy.
Still up in the air are many issues. For example. Congress
as continually refused to award grants of guarantee loans
or the construction of model synthetic fuel plants. The
tiggest complaint is that such a bill is a give away to the
)il companies.
Congress has also been investigating the split up of the
)il companies in a verticle fashion. Right now the debate
Enters on whether the oil companies should be allowed to
nvest in other energy sources. It has been found that all of
tie major oil companies have interests in other energy
iources such as uranium, coal, shale oil, etc. It is feared the
)il companies are developing energy monopolies.
Another particularly hot issue, which could still go either
way is the decontrol of domestic crude. There are many who
rant to lift the price ceilings in order to raise the price of
3as as an effective means to force conservation. And along
that same line is the issue of raising gas taxes. One proposed
method would increase the price at the pump while giving
rebates via the tax structure to low income families,
always the hardest hit by rising energy prices.
Also on the drawing board is a natural gas line from the
North Slope of Alaska. Industry would like Congress to
guarantee loans for the project. They were turned down once,
but they can be expected to try again.
Government Agencies
The most prolific governmental organization has been
E.R.D.A. In charge of directing energy research, it mainly
doles out money to private firms and universities for
specific projects. But even such a mundane task is without
its politics and scandal. On April 19 E.R.D.A. announced
that it was switching its highest priority from the develop-
ment of alternate sources to energy conservation. The
development of alternate supplies was taking longer than
expected,energy conservation measures could produce more
immediate results. It happens that one of E.R.D.A.'s major
"alternate sources" was nuclear power. Ford's favorite.
Coincidentally, Roger Slant, E.R.D.A.'s chief admini-
strator, resigned on April 26. He accused the Ford admini-
stration of not encouraging conservation and complained of
not being listened to by the White House. Apparently there
was a good deal of disagreement between Slant and Ford
on where the emphasis should lie. Slant had been urging a
change of priority for months, but Ford stood death to all
appeals.
Solar Research
In the area of research, one of the major provisions of the
Energy Act of 1975 was the creation of the Solar Energy
Research Center. Although its been over a year, the
government, slow as usual, still hasn't decided where to
locate it. Guaranteed to boost a local economy with millions
of dollars, practically every state has been competing wildly
for it. In Michigan, the Ford Motor Co. offered to donate
one of two different sites should it locate in Michigan.
Surprisingly, the major solar energy project of the year
was begun by the Office of Housing and Urban Develop-
ment. The project is slated for one million dollars which
will pay for the expense of installing solar units in 143
housing and apartment units. Fifty-five public agencies,
builders, and univerisites were awarded funds for their own
projects.

Verification is a term which appears in the provisions of
number of recent arms control agreements, yet its
•ung and purpose are rarely defined. This is because of
e complexity of the verification process itself which is
eth political and technological in nature. The United
ates' continuing commitment to negotiate limitations on
s armaments presupposes a shared confidence on the part of
ie concerned branches of government and the public at
irge that arms control agreements are an integral part of
ne security of our nation. This confidence depends sub-
tantially on the assurance that reciprocal limitations
rantinue to be observed by others. It is the responsibility
if verification to provide this assurance. For this reason
the complexities of the verification process must be under-
stood.
What Is Verification?
To "verify" is to find the truth or reality of something.
Verification is the attempt to check the claims of a statement
against the facts of the case - to look beyond words to
deeds. As a technical term in the vocabulary of arms
control, "verification" refers to the process of assessing
compliance with the provisions contained in an arms control
agreement. It is the attempt to ascertain whether states
are living up to their international obligations.
The Purpose of Verification
The verification of arms control agreements has three
distinct purposes. First, it serves to provide evidence that
violations of an agreement may have taken place and thus
provides timely warning of any national security threat.
Second, by increasing the risk of detection and thus com-
plicating any scheme of evasion, verification helps to
deter violations of an agreement. For verification to be an
effective deterrent, a potential violator must be unaware of
the exact capability of the technology used to monitor his
compliance with an agreement. For this reason secrecy
surrounds much of the details regarding verification tech-
niques. Third, verification serves to build confidence in the
practicality of arms control agreements. Information which
substantiates both parties compliance with the obligations
of an agreement help to create a political atmosphere
conducive to further progress in arms control. Conversely,
verification provides a safeguard against possible manipula-
tion of an atmosphere of trust in pursuit of unilateral
advantage.
Why is Verification Necessary
Unlike treaties, alliances, and trade agreements, arms
control agreements seek to regulate deeds rather than
intentions; yet the performance or non-performance of
those deeds is rarely self-evident. This is not surprising for a
nations armaments are an important guarantor of its security
and governments have always sought to deny precise
information regarding military capabilities to a potential
adversary. Therefore, verification is necessary in order to
obtain information required to determine an adversary's
compliance with an arms agreement. Mere trust is in-
sufficient.
Verification and Intelligence
Although verification does involve the application of
modern intelligence techniques, certification and intelli-
gence differ in their method of approach. While the princi-
pal purpose of military intelligence is to determine the
characteristics and activities of an opponent's weapons and
forces, verification must assess whether those characteristics
or activities exceed the limitations imposed by an agreement
Verification must attempt to prove that certain prohibited
activities are not taking place. Verification must be based on
the assumption that deliberate violations may occur and
will be accomplished by an effort to conceal them.
When is Verification Adequate?
Perfect verification of an arms agreement would require
information that could also severely compromise the security
of the "verified" nation and is therefore impractical. The
question that must be asked then is not whether verification
is perfect, but whether it is adequate.
In attempting to decide whether a prospective agreement
is adequately verifiable, a number of factors must be taken
into account. It is necessary first of all, to consider the
other parties involved in the agreement. Stricter standards
of verification are necessary in agreements between poten-
tial adversaries than between friendly nations. Second, the
degree of risk posed by possible violationsmust be considered.
Greater uncertainties may be tolerated in the verification
of an agreement where violations would not create a sub-
stantial military or political threat. A third consideration is
the relative ease or difficulty of responding to a possible
violation. If violations could be readily detected and yet
never be challenged because of the indirectness of the
evidence involved, verification would be of little use and
the verifiability of the agreement judged inadequate.
Methods of Verification
There exists a variety of ways by which an arms control
agreement can be verified. What type or combination of
methods used depends on the restrictions agreed upon,
potential for violation, and the political advantages and
disadvantages of a particular kind of verification. Foremost
in these considerations is the need to insure adequate
verification. This is one of the principal factors limiting the
March 1977


progress of arms control today.
National Technical Means
Verification by "national technical means" includes
methods of data collection such as: radar and electronic
surveillance, satellite photography, seismic instrumentation,
air sampling systems of high sensitivity, and advanced
techniques for the analysis and evaluation of the collected
data. These methods of obtaining information are all alike
in that none of them operate from installations within the
territory of the party being monitored. Thus, this method
of verification doesn't require formal acceptance of a
foreign presence by the other parties to the agreement.
Also, because the national technical means are unilaterally
controlled, the data provided is reliable and accessible.
Improvements in these technical methods of verification
have greatly broadened the range of possible agreements.
Inspection and On Site Monitoring
Verification through inspection and on site monitoring
refers to those data collection techniques which operate
from the territory or facilities of the party being monitored.
This method of verification includes mobile inspection
teams, fixed posts manned by observers, or unmanned
monitoring instruments equipped with devices to prevent
tampering. Data collection may be limited to certain well
defined acts or left open to whatever the inspectors judge
relevant to verification. Unfortunately, under the kind of
conditions likely to be negotiable in the foreseeable future,
inspection teams may lack the freedom necessary for dis-
covering or observing violations of a serious nature.
Mobile inspection can be frustrated in a variety of ways, and
its value is likely to consist in providing evidence of ob-
structive activities designed to conceal violations rather than
in supplying evidence of the violations themselves. Fixed
post monitoring of military movements may prove more
useful in verifying certain kinds of agreements. This method
of verification should therefore be regarded as a supplement
to national technical means.
Information Exchange
A third category of verification methods requires the
other parties to furnish certain types of technical infor-
mation. This information can be used to aid verification
by national means. For instance, data stating the location,
date, time, yield, and depth of a nuclear test could make
it easier to determine if the test was conducted within tt
constraints of the Limited Test-Ban Treaty. Of course
would be unwise to completely rely on information supph
by the parties being monitored, but such information ca
provide a useful check on data obtained by other verification
methods.
Agreements and What They Limit
Arms control agreements may impose a variety o
strictions, some of which tend to be more easily ven'
than others. Generally speaking, bans are more easily^
fied than numerical limits. A single observation o"
quantity would be sufficient to prove that a violat'°nmbef
occurred, while some uncertainty as to the actua ^
in existence would always remain. Also a ban on
connected with a particular weapon is much more i
to verify than a ban on its testing. Objects that are arge^
stationary are obviously easier to count and M*P ^
than objects that are small and mobile. In fact IS ^

The Types of Possible Violations
Violations or infringement of an arms control agreement
ight take a variety of forms. They could be the result of
cident, oversight, or unauthorized military action. They
iuld also be deliberate yet limited in order to stretch or
st the bounds of a treaty, or they could be deliberate and
assive, intended to achieve a significant military advantage,
hile the possibility of massive violations cannot be safely
nored, it is more likely that violations would occur at the
argins of a treaty. There is always a danger that a party
light attempt to capitalize on its adversaries: investment
i an agreement, in an effort to gain increments of military
(vantage at a minimum of risk. To overlook such
iolations would encourage further probing and more
erious violations. This could adversely affect future arms
ontrol efforts.
Verification and Response
Detecting violations of an arms control agreement is not
mough. What serves to deter a potential violator is not so
much the risk of detection as fear of the political and
military consequences of detection once it occurs. If a
potential violator expects that the reaction to the violation
will be severe enough to outweigh the benefits gained,
violations will be effectively deterred. Finding the proper
response to suspected violations can be a delicate and
difficult task. Some governments feel compelled to react to
evidence of violations with excessive harshness. Other
governments might feel it advisable not to react to evidence
of violations if they found limited violations preferable to
the consequences of an open arms race.
The Dilemma of Response
\n deciding how to respond to a suspected violation, a
number of factors must be taken into account. It would be
necessary to consider the quality of the evidence available,
the source of the evidence, the scope and magnitude of the
suspected violation and the purpose of the violation.
Moreover, any decision would have to be tailored not only
to the facts of the case but to the objectives of national
policy. The central dilemma of response is the problem of
ambiguous evidence. A false challenge may seem like a
provocation and can have a disruptive effect on our relations
with the challenged party. In addition it risks disclosing
valuable information about our verification capabilities.
On the other hand, to tolerate violations, even when the
evidence is less than conclusive, risks weakening not only
the agreement but the entire concept of arms control as well.
Request for clarification is one possible response when
there is ambiguous evidence of a violation. If satisfaction
is not forthcoming, a variety of responses may be considered.
These range from diplomatic protests, to public requests
that an action be discontinued or reversed, notification
that compensatory action will be taken, various kinds of
military measures, and, as a last resort, denunciation of and
withdrawal from the agreement. Response at the appropriate
level can ensure the effectiveness of our verification effort.
We live in an age which is characterized by vast and
growing potentialities for destruction. Arms control offers
a means of lessening the dangers that face us. But if arms
control is not to prove an illusory enterprise, the agreements
we make must be capable of adequate verification.
New and more comprehensive arms control agreements are
likely to pose greater challenges to our verification capa-
bilities. But these challenges we should be prepared to
accept. If the uncertainties of the future are real, the
opportunities for arms control are also real. We cannot
afford to neglect them.

The DNA Controversy:
Science Can Be Hazardous To Your Health
by Mark DesCamp
A funny thing happened to me on the way out of my
recombinant DNA research laboratory last night . . . oops,
I guess that line has been used before. But the implications
of a "funny" thing happening in a DNA research lab are
very serious and should be examined.
Recombinant DNA research is a recent development
in microbiology in which scientists are now able to manu-
facture novel organisms in the laboratory. The process
involves the combination of DNA from two sources to
create a new molecule.
The laboratory procedure is really quite uncomplicated:
it is simple enough, in fact, for any high school student.
DNA molecules from any source (man, cancer viruses.
plants, bacteria, etc.) are mixed with a restrictive i
This enzyme acts as a chemical scalpel, splitting t *^
DNA into fragments with "sticky ends." "I"16 ^
ends" bind two fragments together when they tou
forming new, hybrid microorganisms. .^
This new molecule is then placed in bacteria,^
absorbs it and manufactures copies in huge" .
The bacterium currently in use as the genetic ^

exchange between prokaryotes (primitive ce • ^
bacteria and algal, which lack a nuclear mem r ^
eukaryotes (cells of higher organisms, such as
8
Michigan


At first glance, this new process may not seem a piece
earth-shattering news, but upon closer inspection, it can
shown to have far-reaching consequences.
In the first place, the creation and assimilation into the
vironment of a novel organism will have unknown
nefits and hazards.
On the positive side, the possibility of creating food
ops that can be nourished by nitrogen from the air
itrogen fixing), programming bacteria to manufacture
sulin and other products of human genes, and the
ospect of gene therapy for treatment of crippling genetic
seases build a strong case for intensive research in this area.
rt the dangers are at least as compelling.
Once a new life form is released, it will have irreversible
fects. A possible upsetting of the natural environment
&gt;uld occur with the introduction of these new entities.
nlike other types of pollution, the escape of a novel virus
ould not be taken care of in time by natural processes.
ji example of this would be the escape of some bacteria
rogrammed to make insulin. If this bacteria were to find a
wman host, insulin shock would occur as the person's system
Mcame flooded with insulin, probably resulting in death.
Because of the danger posed by the escape of these
microorganisms from the laboratory, the National Institutes
of Health (NIH) recently published a set of guidelines by
which to conduct these experiments. The guidelines call for
various levels of containment, depending on the predicted
hazards of the experiments. The levels are in two forms,
physical and biological, and are defined as follows:
P1 _ (Physical level #1) - involves standard micorbiologi-
cal techniques, with experiments being done on an open
lab bench.
P2 - similar to P1, but access to the laboratory is
limited when the experiments are in progress.
P3 — the laboratory is separated from areas open to
the general public. Biological safety cabinets are available
within the lab for any work with open vessels.
P4 - the facility is either a separate building or a
controlled interior area completely isolated from the
rest of the building. A separate ventilation system that
maintains negative air pressure, a treatment system to
decontaminate exhaust air and showers with clothes
changes for workers are the basic features.
EK1 - (Biological level #1) - the use of E. coli as the
host for recombinant DN A.
EK2 - the use of an E. coli strain which through genetic
modification, has weakened so that (in theory) only 1 in 10,8
survive outside the lab.
EK3- the same as EK2 except that a private investigator
has confirmed the survival rate.
The problem with biological containment at the present
time is that the host is E. coli, a normal inhabitant of the
human digestive tract that easily enters the body through
the mouth or nose. E. coli is fouhd in sewage as well as in
pigs, cows, fish, insects, and plants. Man alone harbors
several varieties of it. Some strains of the bacterium cause
diseases.
In addition to being "everywhere you look, these days,"
E. coli is very promiscuous and during mating even ex-
changes genetic information with other types of bacteria.
Thus, if escape occurs, it is likely to affect the populace,
because E. coli is so common.
A second problem lies in the fact that the effect of
foreign DNA on the host cannot be predicted. Some
of the new organisms might react favorably with the
weakened E. coli strain and make it more viable, negating
the supposed safeguard of one in every 100 million
surviving outside the laboratory.
Even if the strain does die, it will not guarantee that the
DNA molecules that are part of the genes of the dead bac-
teria will not be absorbed by a living cell. In nature, cells
commonly take up leftover genetic molecules of dead cells,
and the living cells at times incorporate these genes into
their own genetic makeup.
The guidelines also fail to state the time period over which
the death rate of the bacteria is to be measured. This
leaves the following question unanswered; "Do the 99 out of
100 million die immediately upon exposure to the envi-
ronment or does the process take hours or even days?"
The physical levels, although appearing restrictive, are
also open to question. Studies at Fort Deteich (where the
Army conducts biological warfare research) have been
somewhat unsettling. Significant leakage and exposure has
been shown to occur whenever experiments are carried out
on a bench top (as is the case for levels P1 and P2). At the
P3 level, there were 52 reported infections between 1960
and 1969. Careless lab techniques could even negate P4
containment procedures. But the discussion so far has
centered on practice in the best laboratories. The real
problem will be how to control the technique when it gets
into the hands of the worst.
With the present position taken by the NIH, DNA re-
search centers will continue to increase. As the push for new
discoveries is intensified, more people will become involved
in the work. This will increase the chances of mistake in the
lab and subsequent leakage into the environment.
A possible alternative would be to concentrate research
in one place (such as Fort Detrich) until the risks are more
well defined for each type of experiment and until a better
host can be found. Doing this will slow down the pace of
discovery in this field, but the risks to society will be
greatly reduced also.
The basic question that needs to be answered, then, is
whether we are ready to assume the responsibilities that
modern science brings along with our rights to investigate
new techniques. Science, like any other powerful tool,
cannot be used without the proper safeguards. It is not e-
nough for us to glibly state that, with the aid of this new
technique, we can "see the light at the end of the tunnel."
We must make sure that the light isn't heading our way
at a high rate of speed.

by Steve Stathos
During the course of our engineering studies, we learn
many "effects". There's the photoelectric effect, the
ornpton effect, the piezoelectric effect, and the Causin
feet to name but a few. One very famous effect which is
oticeably absent from all engineering texts is the Grover
3eveland Effect. Because of its importance to the history
if aviation and because I seem to be the only one who
:nows anything about it, I would like to take this oppor-
unity to explain this strange phenomenon to you. As
ilways the case when explaining strange phenomenon, it will
irst be necessary to introduce a substantial amount of
'pertinent background material".
As you are probably well aware, a modern day blimp is, to
i good first approximation, a large balloon filled with
Helium that provides modern man with an over view of
Jomed stadiums while constantly praising the current annum.
This was not always the case. In fact, as you are probably
not aware, it wasn't until 1883, nine years before Billy
Carter ... er ... Pabst won the blue ribbon, that Gustav
Vind invented the first inflatable blimp. Prior to this often
overlooked turning point in aviation history, blimps were
not inflatable. They were constructed of the same substance
used today to make non-inflatable tricycle tires. It should
be pointed our that these non-inflatable blimps didn't
actually fly — they bounced. They were dropped on end
from high structures which were appropriately but unima-
ginatively called "Blimp Launching Towers" or BLT's for
short. Several years later, however, the acronym was
disallowed by the FAA because of possible confusion with
the recently developed bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwich.
The shape of the non-inflatable blimps could either be
described as an elipsoid of revolution, for all you calculus
lovers, or as a football, for all of you in LS&amp;A. Due to their
shape, these blimps bounced erratically. As it turned out,
calculating the range or distance the blimp would travel as a
function of launch height was fairly simple. The direction
of the flight however could only be determined empirically.
Since distance is a vector quantity, several problems were
encountered. Some of the difficulties were overcome by a
converting to polar coordinates. Tickets for blimp travel were
not sold on a city to city basis but rather by radial distance.
For instance, a person could buy a "R=100mile" cr
"R=200miles" ticket but could not specify the 0. (A
modified version of this ticket system was adopted by the
New York Subway system in 1971 and is still operating
today.)
The result of this non-directional quality of blimp flight
was that many landed in large bodies of water and sank.
Aside from the tremendous loss of human life, such
occurences were disastrous financially since the heavy
sunken blimps were not salvageable. It was this fact that
inspired Vind to invent the inflatable blimp. Upon unveiling
his creation to the world Vind said: "This craft isdredgeable".
Unfortunately, due to his heavy accent Vind was mis-
quoted and the word "dirigible" was introduced to the
world as a type of inflatable blimp.
Another, perhaps more pertinent result of this non-
directional quality of blimp flight can best be explained by
example. A blimp is launched from New York and is headed
for Philadelphia. Instead of landing there however the blimp
merely bounces again and ends up right back in New York,
where the passengers are promptly billed for a round trip.
It was precisely this unexpected appearance of a large blimp
that came to be known as the Grover Cleveland Effect, for
obvious reasons.
Now you may think that all this has absolutely nothing
to do with modern aviation. That would be incorrect. You
see there was a very small boy of eight who was awed over
the concept of flight. He used to go out everyday after
school and watch the blimps take off. All through his
life he kept abreast of the many advances in aviation. When
it was time to make his way in the world he chose aviation
as his field of endeavor. Gradually he worked his way up
through the ranks. Eventually, he decided to become an
aircraft designer and manufacturer, and opened up such a
shop which today is a major corporation. When it came
time for this man to name his small business he thought
back on how the blimps of yesteryear had inspired him. And
so he decided to name his small company after the sound
these blimps made upon launch. Yes my friends, that is
how "Boeing" came to be.

50 and 25
Years Ago

An interesting historical puzzle popped up in the
preparation of this month's column. The March 1927 issue
of the Technic featured an article entitled "The Detroit
Rapid Transit System." That's fine, but Detroit has no
rapid transit system and never has. So what can this be?
According to the article, written by someone obviously
involved in the matter, Detroit Mayor James Couzens
appointed five men to his newly created Rapid Transit
Commission on November 27, 1922. During the four en-
suing years these five men, with the help of outside ex-
perts, worked on a master plan for the city and the
surrounding areas. Many ideas were considered and discar-
ded as the project progressed until, at last, a finalized
proposal was agreed upon. All surrounding communities
within fifteen miles of the city had been involved or con-
sulted. It was an ambitious plan, but a well designed one.
The Rapid Transit Commission's proposal consisted of
an integrated system of superhighways and trains exten-
ding radially from the center of the city. It was approved
by the Detroit Common Council on April 4, 1925 making
it the official city master plan. Legislation was passed
granting the power to obtain the thoroughfares while
financing and construction were also approved.
Each branch of the system consisted of a four lane
divided highway and a two track rail system. The highways
would be limited access for long distance travel with streets
running along either side for local traffic. The trains were
to run underground inside the city, then emerge and run
down the median in the outer parts of the system. Cross
traffic would be handled on separated grades every half
mile and stations would be located every half mile. As the
system grew, express trains would be added to speed
people to remote areas.
Everything was all set to go, except for one thing: voter
approval. The issue was scheduled to go on the ballot April
4, 1927. Since this article was published before that date,
it obviously could not contain the results.
Curious, I trucked on over to the library and dug out the
April 4 &amp; 5 issues of The Detroit Free Press and The Detroit
News. Oddly, I found no mention of the proposal in either
paper. Something mysterious evidently happened in early
1927 to prevent it from being put on the ballot. How
unfortunate for Detroit, and how strange.

In this new technology, transparency of the
glass fibers is a critical factor in their ability to
carry light signals for communications. And
thanks, in part, to advances in materials analysis
achieved by Jim Mitchell and his colleagues, Bell
Labs and Western Electric are producing some of
the most transparent glass the world has ever
known.
Jim led a task force that identified and
measured extremely small amounts of impurities
&amp;&gt;
in raw materials used to make glass fibers. With
BS in chemistry from North Carolina A&amp;T, and i
PhD in analytical chemistry from Iowa State, he
was well prepared for the job.
Since contamination could easily be caused I

first designed a special "clean room" for the
research and then devised highly sensitive
analytical methods for measuring impurities as
low as two parts per billion. One of his technique
called cryogenic sublimation, is a promising low
temperature process for purifying chemical
reagents.
Jim's contribution to basic knowledge
about the measurement of low-level
impurities was essential for developmen
of today's sophisticated fiber-making
procedures. As a result of this and othe

She took part in a revolution
where little blood was shed.
Getting blood from a baby is a little like trying to
get blood from a stone.
An infant has very little blood to spare.
"%t, there are times when a newborn child requires
critical blood tests. And some very fast results.
Union Carbide has answered these needs by
developing a revolutionary blood testing instrument
known as the CentrifiChem Analyzer.
It requires unusually small quantities of blood.
Which means enough can be drawn through a simple
prick in the finger or heel of a child or adult.
With that tiny amount ofblood, the CentrifiChem
System can detect symptoms of cardiac, liver, kidney
and other bodily disorders. And this unique machine
is capable of performing blood tests so fast it can
help save a life that once might have been lost.
Union Carbide has developed three vital systems
for the critical clinical diagnostics field. ,
The Centria system, which is able to detect m
minutest quantities of substances circulating in
bloodstream. . , c,f
The CintiChem system, designed exclusively »

Our search for energy begins with people.
America needs energy.
Its economy depends on it.
But to find it, Gulf needs minds.
Good minds.
The search for energy is not a simple
problem, and there will be no simple
solutions.
It demands people with a wide
variety of talents and skills. People with
imagination, determination, ingenuity,
and perseverance.
No other industry today offers such
an amazing diversity of complex, sophis-
ticated problems—problems that must
be solved today and problems that may
take 20 years to solve.
The energy business has changed.
It's no longer simply a matter of locating
and producing crude oil.
We need to search for it in strange,
difficult locations.
We need to develop energy resources
without destroying or polluting our
environment.
We need to go beyond known sources
of energy and explore alternatives such
as oil shale, geothermal power, tar sands,
coal, and solar power.
But first we need people.
Chemical and petroleum engineers,
geologists, geophysicists, geological
engineers, chemists, and mining engineers.
Gulf Oil Corporation has allocated
some $1,000,000,000 to be spent this year
on energy development programs in the
United States alone.

THIS MONTH'S TECHNIC
ITie versatility of an engineering degree is often over-
bed. Engineers can be found everywhere doing all
ds of non-engineering jobs. One of the opportunities
h\ to engineering graduates is professional school,
tting a bachelors degree in engineering first may not
the easiest way, but it is possible and can be a valuable
aerience. This month's cover story, "Engineering College
d Professional School — Do They Mesh?" explores
2 possibilities of an engineering graduate being admitted
the professional schools at U of M — Architecture,
isiness. Dental, Law, Medicine, etc. The article was
searched and written by Freshman Thomas Rainwater.
Inspired by last December's article, "Who Controls
* Sea?" Ric Lee offered to write a follow-up article on
ie subject. "Butchering the Whale — A Slaughterhouse on
ie Sea" is the fruit of his efforts. The issue of harvesting
fiales has become a prominent one in the last few years.

ituation.

iderable interest this year is the construction of the

by the Civils, Naval Archs, and other interested students.
Technic writer Greg Werth talked with the coordinators
of the project and got the lowdown which he presents in
his article, "Row, Row, Row Your Rock!"
A while back, Technic picked up an odd story of a
scientist who believes that earth was visited by an un-
manned space probe from the constellation e Bootes.
What is even stranger, he has some data which has led
him to this conclusion. As far as we know, the story was
only published once, in the magazine Spaceflight.
Technic's Bill Cowie found out what this theory is all
about, what the supporting evidence is, and reports on
it in his article, "What's that Echo . . . cho . . . o . . .?"
And, yes, of course, as usual, there is "50 and 25 Years

thirteenth consecutive attempt at this column. He says
he's not superstitious, but this will be his last (thank God!).

from the editor's desk
Whafd He Say?
As Editor of the Technic I have been confronted directly
with the horrendous inability of students to write, or for
that matter, construct a logical and readable sentence. My
experience has been mainly with engineering students, so I
will restrict my comments to them. However, according to
the February 28 issue of the University Record, English
professors from LS&amp;A have the same complaint about their
students.
I do not propose to offer any explanations for this
phenomenon, I simply wish to confirm that it exists.
Furthermore, it is inexcusable for any student at the
University of Michigan to be as verbally handicapped as
some of the examples I've witnessed. We are college students
and we attend one of the nation's best universities; if a
student can't write on a college level, what is he doing here?
For mere survival, any graduate of this institution should be
able to compose an intelligent sounding business letter, yet
there are those who can't. I am not condemning the student,
the University, or anyone else, but I want them to realize
that there is a real problem.
Many engineering students underestimate their need for
composition skills. Effectively, when we talk about writing
skills we are talking about communication. A good deal of
important communication takes place in writing, especially
in engineering. Good engineering relies on effective communi-
cation. An engineer may have good ideas, but if he can't
communicate them his ideas won't do anyone any good.
The writing ability of the engineer has long been a joke,
unfortunately the last laugh is often on the engineer.
I do not ask for perfection, just readibility. I have read
some manuscripts in which I was totally unable to tell head
from tail. Those are extreme cases, but they should n
exist at all.
I do not intend to imply that there aren't any engirw
who can write; I have seen many examples to the contra
Therefore, I am convinced that this inability is not inhere
in engineers, and why should it be? Developing writing ski
is simply a matter of practice; reading examples of g«
writing and imitating it. Many of the good writers I kno
are not people who have all of the rules of grammar mefl
orized, they have just developed a feel for good wriM
through practice. Granted, some people have a natural na!
for writing, but anyone at the college level should be able)
construct a readable paragraph.
I will be the first to admit that I am no expert or tin
I have all the rules memorized, for my own backgroun
is embarrasingly lacking. From what I have seen, learniq
to write is basically developing an "ear" for good writing

enroll in AFROTC
The Air Force needs commissioned officers in
the science and engineering areas. Many will enter
active duty through Air Force ROTC.
And you don t have to wait for graduation to re-
ceive financial help. You can be paid as you earn
your college degree.
Check the list of college majors. If yours is on
the list, you could qualify for either a 2 or 3-year
AFROTC scholarship that includes full
tuition, books, all lab fees and $100 a
month, tax free. Even without the
scholarship you can get excellent
Air Force ROTC training and the
$100 a month tax-free allowance during
the last two years of college.
Upon graduation, you will be
commissioned as an Air Force Reserve
Officer and may be selected for extended active
duty. As an active duty officer you will have the
opportunity for a challenging, technical, responsi-
ble job. There is also a chance for advanced education
in your chosen field. And the pay and related bene-
fits are excellent. You'll start with good pay and
allowances; academic and technical training oppor-
tunities; 30 days of paid vacation each year; free

medical and dental care; recreational facilities; low
cost insurance; commissary and exchange privileges;
and more advantages.
In return for the AFROTC scholarship or train-
ing, you are expected to maintain a hign level of
scholastic excellence and agree to remain on active
duty with the Air Force for a minimum of four years.
A limited active-duty opportunity is also there
for highly qualified non-Air Force ROTC
graduates. Graduates whose degree ap-
pears on the list may apply for officer
training. Successful applicants will at-
tend a 12-week Officer Training School
located in San Antonio, Texas. Gradu-
ates of the school receive an Air Force
commission and are on the way to chal-
lenging jobs as Air Force officers.
Check the list again and for more information
visit your campus Air Force ROTC representative or

Jndoubtedly there are many students in Engineering
k&gt;I who won't graduate for two to three years and
efore haven't given much thought to what they want to
&gt;nce they get their degree. Then again there are probably
ly students who are unhappy in engineering, feeling
they don't really belong in the program, and there must
in equally significant number of engineering students who
about to graduate with their bachelor's degree and are
ndering what they'll be doing once they get it. If you
)pen to fit any one of these categories then take a few
-lutes to stop and read this article, it might give you some
as about what you want to do with your future.
Recently I talked with admissions counselors and
airmen of the various professional programs here at U of
concerning the engineering student and admission to
ofessional school. We've discussed the admissions re-
tirements of the respective schools and what they like to see
an applicant, recommended courses as well as required
les, and they gave advice which they felt was helpful
engineering students interested in their programs. The
•ofessional schools which I visited are: Architecture and
rban Planning; Business Administration, Dentistry, Law,
id Medicine. They were more than happy to talk with me
id indicated that students interested in their programs
ould do well to check with the admissions offices of the
ispective schools as soon as they think they want to
ursue that course of study.
Architecture
First I talked with Mr. Herbert W. Yoey, Assistant Dean
f the College of Architecture. He expressed his feelings
iat education is more than reading books and learning
Tories. His philosophy of the Architecture program is
uite pragmatic: "Students shouldn't try to get into pro-
essional school to get a philosophy of architecture. They
hould try to find the applications of architecture. I think
t is generally wrong for students to get a Bachelors, then a
Masters and then a Doctorate degree in engineering, archi-
ecture, or any other profession with no working experience
n those fields. Education is not theoretical, we shouldn't
ust develop philosophies, we should try to find the applica-
tions."
Yoey was quick to point out the school's field experience
Program, where a student may earn up to eight hours of
Active credit for twenty-four or more weeks of work in
architecture or related areas under approved conditions by
toe Architecture Administration. He then went on to say,
"Our program is working!", adding that about one third of
toe students enrolled in the six year architecture program
quit after they get their bachelors degree to work for a year
or two, and then come back for their first professional
degree, the Master of Architecture. These students are
automatically readmitted provided they left the school in
good standing.
Although the school advises students with interests in
architecture to apply to LS&amp;A for their first two years, I
was assured that engineering students would not be rejected
provided they had taken a lot of humanities and social science
classes. The reason for the recommended social science
and humanities classes, he explained is that architecture
deals with "society, behavior, and technology," while
engineering students often tend to be too technically
oriented.
Urban Planning
The Masters of Urban Planning program, chaired by Dr.
Richard Duke, is a small program. Only about 40-50
students are admitted each year. Of these 50 students,
approximately one third are out of state students, one third
are in state students, and the remaining third are normally
U of M graduates, leaving the number of engineering
students very small. This is further reduced considering many
of the students come from the social sciences as well as the
hard sciences. According to Dr. Duke, they probably have
at least one student from almost every degree program at
Michigan enrolled in Urban Planning.
Like Architecture, they prefer the student who has
worked for a year or two and advise that student go ahead
and work for a short time before going into the program,
but are willing to take students directly from undergra-
duate work, although most of their students have had prior
work experience.
Another point to consider when looking for a degree
program is the availability of jobs. Duke was quick to
point to the fact that virtually all of their students get
jobs upon graduation and that engineering and urban
planning are an excellent combination which usually results
in a well-paying job.
Engineering students are generally excellent students
due to the rigorousness of their training, observed Prof.
Duke. However, many engineering students feel they can
solve all of humanity's problems with formulas, and tend to
be too technically oriented. Conceding that engineering
students may have an edge over the liberal arts student in
that they can adjust to a less rigorous program more readily
than most liberal arts students can adjust to a tougher
program, he said that he would advise those students interes-
ted in the Masters program in Urban Planning to take as
many non-quantitative courses as allowable in their engin-
eering curriculum in preparation for a broad based educa-
tional program.
Business Administration
Next, I spoke with Mrs. Cynthia Cross, Assistant Direc-
tor of Student services, about the Bachelor of Business
April 1977


rated with their liberal arts peers. I was informed they are
both looked at quite equally, since the admissions people
feel that engineering and LSA students take primarily the
same courses for the first two years. About the only
required courses outside of the engineering curriculum would
be the addition of Economics 201. She did recommend that
students be aware of and attempt to complete the required
distribution courses prior to gaining admission to the BBA
program.
Mrs. Cross emphasized the importance of the grade
point average and explained that, "We realize that many
freshmen are searching out new areas of interest and may
have some lower grades in these areas." If the student is
marginal with grades on the lower end of the scale, such as
2.9 — 3.3, then they look- especially hard at the economics
and mathematics grades, but it would be best to keep the
grade point up around a 3.4 or better to gain much better
standing for admission.
Her advice to students in engineering interested in
applying to the BBA program would be to continue with
the bachelors degree in engineering and then go on and get a
masters degree in business administration, unless the students
definitely want to get out of engineering before then.
Mr. Richard Johnson, the counselor for the Masters of
Business Administration, advises engineering students to
forget about getting the Masters degree in engineering unless
they plan on spending nearly all of their career in activities
such as Research and Development and get a more valuable
degree, the Master of Business Administration. He said that
employers are exceptionally interested in people with the
technical training of the engineering background coupled
with the MBA and that starting salaries are usually quite
high. He also noted that approximately one-third of all their
students are engineering students.
According to Johnson many of the students have worked
a few years before getting into the MBA program, usually
because they find out after working a while that they need
the degree to move up in the management related areas of
business. He recommends that students interested in the
program take Economics 201 and as many other business
related courses as possible.
As far as admission requirements go, the emphasis is
placed on the grade point average of the applicant, the
scores received on the GMAT (Graduate Management
Admissions Test), work experience, recommendations re-
ceived on the applicant, the way the questions are answered,
and any extracurricular activities.
Law
"Engineering students certainly would not be looked
down upon, we certainly realize the difficulties of the
sciences," commented Roger Martindale, Assistant Dean of
the Law School. The Law School is looking for a well
rounded educational preparation and would like to see as
much exposure as possible to many different fields, with a
major in nearly any field, to show that the student has
mastered some area of specialization.
Martindale said that the difficulties of being adird
from an engineering background would be in the individun
qualifications. They are looking for the candidate who y
had the well rounded program with a considerable amoun
of reading and writing analysis. He explained how die ad
mission process works: the LSAT (Law School Adnrnson
Test) is heavily weighed along with the individual's grad
point average and undergraduate courses selected.
The admissions process is broken down into two pan
The first part is based primarily on a statistical predicts
of the LSAT scores and the other aforementioned das
the second part is based upon a pool of applicants. Tinpoq
of applicants is established on the basis of the sameprede
tions as the first with the minimum standards varyingaca?
ding to the competition of the year. The uniquenessofthj
second group is that once in this pool selection is madewrdl
little regard for the test scores of GPA. Students are selects
on the premise of making the school a livelier place, rich whU
a variety of student backgrounds. His advice to students i&gt;
terested in law school would be to gain outside expenena
and get involved in extracurricular activities which would
make them a valuable resource to the entering class.
In preparing for the LSAT, Mr. Martindale suggestsm
students take the practice LSAT tests in order to understand
the kind of test it is and to better one's score, which man
ultimately be the difference in being admitted or rejected 5t
the Michigan Law School.
Medicine
How about the medical program, what are they looking
for? Although they require many science related courses,
most of which can be met through the engineering program
they are seeking people who can communicate effectivev
both through written and verbal english. They don't want a
student who has had primarily a science and math bac
ground, they are seeking the more well rounded stu en
Courses such as psychology and sociology are strong,
recommended, along with a lot of extra biology-
Probably one of the biggest criterion judged by ij
admissions people is the work experience the student a

hospital with medical personnel) is very important an

Another of the big considerations is the scores on the

•chool; how come it took until now to decide he wanted
to be a doctor, and what made him suddenly decide to
go to medical school. He would have to show the
admissions committee that he has the motivation and
Potential to do well in medical school.
Dental School
If you've been wondering what your chances are of
getting into Dental school with your engineering back-
ground, I've got some good news for you. Your chances are
at least as good as anybody else, from any other degree
Program. Dr. Donald Strachan, Assistant Dean of the
School of Dentistry told me there is no required degree
Program to gain admittance to Dental School saying, "We
don't really look at the student's major." Although many
of the dental students are biology majors, Dr. Strachan
Pointed out that he himself was a history major.
How well do engineering students do in getting admitted
and how well do they do once they get admitted?
The top student in Dental School several years ago was an
aeronautical engineer. According to Dr. Strachan, Engineering
students usually do well in the perceptual motor ability part
o&lt; the DAT (Dental Admissions Test), one of the talents ne-
cessary for work in dentistry. He went on to explain that the
DentalSchoolhasnoformula,perse, for admitting students to
their school. There are many factors involved in the
admission process involving three broad areas. These are:
1) Personality and character of the individual — including
communication abilities and the other intangible qualities
such as motivation. 2) The grade point average which is
Codified by the course quality and the school the student
comes from 3) the DAT consisting of four parts 11 Ability
(Survey of Natural Sciences) 2) Reading comprehension
31 Verbal and quantitative ability &amp; 4) Perceptual Motor
ability.
A point which Dr. Strachan stressed is that they are very
much aware of the quality of the courses and the school the
student is enrolled in. "We are aware that the grading
practices are harder in Engineering, we know too that many
transcripts are "padded" with courses where it's easy to get
an A, whereas in Engineering there's usually a much cleaner
program."
They also like to see more than the required courses of
Chemistry, Biology, Math, English,and a full limit of electives
such as economics, philosophy and the fine arts, especially
since they will help the applicant's score on the DAT.
Although they don't emphasize work experience like the
Medical program. Dr. Strachan recommends that students,
"secure some knowledge of the Dental profession by ob-
serving a day or week's work in a dental office," which is
just plain common sense. It would be foolish to commit
oneself to a program before he/she really knew what it was
all about.
For those students interested in the Dental program, it is
recommended that they contact the dental admissions
office early in their sophomore year, and start the application
process at least 16 months in advance of the time they plan
to enroll.
Conclusions
Graduating from the Engineering College doesn't appear
to be a detriment in any way to gaining admission to any of
the professional programs. If anything, it appears to be an
asset to be an engineering student. Most programs do have
their requirements, many of which can be met through the
normal core program in engineering. It would be wise for
students interested in a specific program to check with the
admissions offices of the respective schools well in advance
of the time they plan to enroll for specific answers to their
specific questions. That's what they are there for.
April 1977


A Slaughterhouse on the Sea
by Ric Lee
A whale is defined as: "a large sea mammal that super-
ficially resembles a fish but breathes air and suckles its
young," according to the New Merriam-Webster Pocket
Dictionary. This is about as much as most people know
about whales. But whales (cetaceans) evolved from small
four legged land animals which returned to the sea. Their
adaptation tooceaniclife was almost perfect. Unfortunately,
due to large scale harvesting, whales are becoming increasing-
ly sparse.
Whales live in a dense medium where sounds, traveling
faster and farther than in air, play the dominating role in
perception and communication. They can communicate
with one another over vast spaces of ocean along the "sound
channel", a feature of the open ocean typically at depths
around 1000 meters at mid-latitudes and near the surface
in polar regions. A sound channel is a boundary layer of
two different densities and/or temperatures which channels
sound over great distances (greater than 100kms)1.
Dolphins, being the most studied of all whales because
of their small size and relative large numbers, are known to
have a large part of their brain devoted to the reception and
transmission of sound. Basically small whales make three
types of sounds: a shriek-shouting sound which they use
when talking to humans, a gentle whistling which they use
to talk to each other, and a rapid clicking sound used for
locating objects. With the characteristics of water, one
might expect the sound waves of the echo locating beam
of dolphins to spread in all directions. But dolphins are able
to concentrate sound waves into a narrow beam. (If human
engineers were asked to produce such a narrow beam in
water, they would need two generators the size of a small
10
room. The dolphin does it in his head.) Each animal has its
own identifying sound by which it can be recognized in air
or water. Like humans they are able to recognize a voice
whether shouted, whispered, or distorted by telephone.
The hydrodynamic requirements of the animal dont
allow it to change its skin or facial expression to suit its
moods. The fixed curve of its mouth helps it swim better, it
has nothing to do with a grin. Feelings are expressed and
probably read by looking into each other's echo chamber
and making changes in the sound reflective propertieso
animal's own receptive system. Emotion is thus large y a
"internal" thing, as far as expressing it goes, according to
Dr. Kenneth Norris of the Oceanic Institute in Hawaii.
Whales, of which some species are the largest animals on
earth, would suffocate under their own weight on land,
they are well adapted for sea life. Deep diving whales use oxy
gen very efficiently - twice as efficiently as that of l»f-
poises having poorer diving capabilities. Dr. EJ-
of the University of Amsterdam, a leading expert o^
whales, estimated that the lung capacity of a 70 oo
whale is 2000 liters, compared to 40 liters for an
bottlenose whale and five liters for a 150 pound man'
are estimated to replace 80-90% of the air in their u^
with each inhalation compared to only about
humans. Whale myoglobin, the oxygen binding
that occurs in the muscle has 8-9 times the oxygen
capacity of that of terrestrial animals.2
Because of their massive size and diving ^
whales have no natural enemies, thus making the ^
ble only to man. Picture a giant mammal divi"9
feet for 20 minutes ... the harpooner is ready an'


with the 90 millimeter cannon on the high-prowed bow of the
whaler.3 Closing within 60 yards of the leviathan he pulls
the trigger. The 100 pound harpoon, hauling a heavy
hawser, blasts from the barrel. Three seconds later the
whale is dead. The harpoon pierced its brain.
Thousands of these mighty monarchs of the sea, or
leviathans in the eyes of seamen and whalers, are being
ruthlessly slaughtered annually. It took all the men and all
the ships of New Bedford, the principal Massachusetts
whaling port, over a century and a half to kill 30,000
whales.4 Now twice that many die in a single year. From
the moment a 42 foot, 15 year old creature is winched
aboard by the tail, to the time every scrap of it is gone and
the floor empty, 29 minutes will have elapsed. Altogether,
18 tons of whale brings a whaling company approximately
$13,000.5
Demand has slipped somewhat in recent years as
supplies decreased and prices climbed. But Japan still
imports thousands of tons from South Korea and the
Soviet Union, which with Japan take over 80% of each
year's wide whale harvest.
An organization to regulate whaling in the interest of all
nations — the International Whaling Commission — was
established in late 1946 in Washington D.C. Each June
representatives of 14 nations, only six of them engaged
in deep-sea whaling, meet in London as the International
Whaling Commission (IWC). Last year from June 21 to
June 25 they determined the 1977 catch quotas for each
species of whale. The IWC quota system is weighted most
heavily toward the blue whale, the largest of all animals.
Until 1971 the annual quota was not stated in numbers per
species, but in Blue Whale Units (BWU). To kill one BWU,
a whaler could take one blue whale, or two finbacks, or two
and a half humpbacks, or six seis.6 Since it is every bit as
costly to chase, kill, and butcher one sei as it is for one blue,
the whalers concentrated on the blues and took other
species only when they had to.
The quotas, which are intended to prohibit killing of
certain whale species and prevent overkilling of others, are
divided between countries and then divided between com-
panies. They are then further divided between factory ships
which stay at sea for months at a time. The quotas have
been getting smaller each year. Japan's 60,000 tons in
1975 is one-tenth of what the catch was a decade ago.
The International Whaling Commission produced a
quota reduction of 40% over the past three years but
recently turned down the American proposal for a 10-year
moratorium on the killing of whales. In 1973 the quota
totalled 45,673 whales; the 1976 quota was 27,939.7
The IWC customarily sets its quotas at levels that satisfy
or appease Japan and the Soviet Union.
There are seven nations practicing whaling that are not
members of the IWC. These countries, operating outside
any regulation, are Peru, Chile, Spain, Portugal, South
Korea, Mainland China, and Somalia.
Japanese whaling interests own the Peruvian whaling
station where more than 1800 whales are killed each year;
many of them undersized and part of a highly endangered
species. The Japanese whalers purchase whale meat from
South Korean, Spanish and Somali whalers as well as im-
porting the Peruvian whale meat.
When the U.S. introduced a resolution barring the
April 1977


purchase of whaling products from non-member nations
Japan denounced the move and led a majority of the
15-member commission in defeating the resolution.8
Two years ago the Japanese, like the Russians, took
advantage of their technical right to ignore the quotas
fixed by the commission majority (if a particular IWC
nation dislikes the quota set at the annual summer
meeting, it can escape the limitation simply by filing
an objection within ninety days); but they accepted last
year's quotas without any reservations. One theory is that
the boycott of Japanese products by private American
groups and the threat of its spread persuaded the Tokyo
government that the sentiment was real and deeply felt.
Charter members of IWC are Australia, Argentina,
Britain, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Japan, Mexico,
New Zealand, Norway, Panama, South Africa, Brazil,
Soviet Union, and the United States. Most countries had
little reason to join IWC. Not belonging they can whale as
they please with no regard for quotas or protected species
and not be subject to any sanctions from the IWC
countries.
Nothing in the charter prevents an IWC member from
selling whaling equipment to nonmembers or from buying
their whaling products.9 Furthermore, the IWC lacks the
power to police its membership. The rules require every
factory ship to carry an IWC observer to ensure that the kill
includes only whales of acceptable size and species. How-
ever, until 1972, the observer was of the same nationality
as the ship he served; many observers were not about to
turn their skipper in for hauling a disallowed whale out of
the water. Although the observers are now international, the
IWC itself cannot punish offenders. It can merely recommend
disciplinary action against a transgressor by his government
without any assurance that such action will be taken.
In 1972 congress passed the Marine Mammals Protection
Act. This law prohibits whaling in American waters or by
American citizens, bars any ship carrying whale products
from using American port facilities, and outlaws the
importation of any whale product. Subsequently, Britain,
which was consuming about 30,000 tons of whale meat and
oil a year (a yield of some 2700 whales) passed a similar
law against imports.
The oceans cover seven-tenths of the earth making the
reduced populations of whales increasingly difficult to
find. This fact of whaling life has forced the Russians and
Japanese to accept lowered kills.
Modern whaling burns more expensive fuel and must
meet bigger payrolls, than the old style, so with the catch
falling off, earnings have plummeted as well. Last winter
the Soviets put one of their three Antarctic fleets in
mothballs. The six Japanese whaling companies laid off half
their 3000 employees, and merged into the Japan Joint
Whaling Company to cut costs.'0
There is no doubt, whaling isn't profitable. The Japan-
ese whaling fleets are reported to be virtually bankrupt,
always operating in the red, bolstered by subsidies from
their parent companies. Then why is anybody whaling?
Besides the most popular reasons - for oil, meat,«4
byproducts — two other seemingly plausible reasons are41
amortization of expensive equipment and wastefulness J
refraining from using it.
Whaling is not economically important to any naton
Even the largest whaling fleets are minor subsidiariesd
large fishing and shipping companies.
It seems that economic forces rather than humanity*!
dissipate the whaling industry. According to Nikolai Maka'o,
the Soviet charge d'affaires in Ottawa, his government*!
give up whaling within the next two years. TheJapanesi
cannot continue much longer than the Russians.^
How many whales are there? The controversy o*
killing whales centers on exterminating their species but
whales are elusive animals. They dive deep and range far

The blue whale population, according to the best
estimates used by the United States Government, was over
200,000 at the beginning of this century is now estimated
to be down to 10,000 or 2,000, depending on sources, ft

down to about 100,000 now. Sperm whales were arouno

Whales once down from 15,000 to a low of only 200 due to
extensive slaughter in the Sea of Cortez where it is shallow
and very easy for whalers to trap the breeding herds, are
presently in excess of 11,000 thanks of conservation mea
sures of the United States Government.
One of the commercial reasons whales are such a precious
commodity is their fine oil. Whale oil is used mainly as raw-
material for margarine and compound cooking fat. Spew
whale oil, which is really a liquid wax, can be employee
only for such purposes as the manufacture of lubricants a
fatty alcohols. Before the discovery of petroleum, whae
oil was used as fuel for lamps and lubricant for macnirw

Jojoba's native habitat is in the Sonoran Desert of the
lerican southwest. The desert comprises approximately
0,000 square miles between latitudes 25° to 31° north.
the Sonoran Desert, the deciduous evergreen shrub
:upies elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 feet, and
hough it does occur where the rainfall is less than five
:hes, its greatest dominance is where the rainfall is 15
18 inches annually (below ten inches is considered desert;
in Arbor's annual rainfall is about 30 inches).
The oil (liquid wax) of the acorn-size jojoba nut com-
ses 50% of its weight. Some of the potential uses are:
Lubrication: It requires little or no refining for use with
jh-speed machinery or machinery operating at high tem-
ratures and pressures. It may also be suitable as a trans-
rmer oil or an oil for delicate mechanisms.
Cosmetics: Presently used as component of hair oil and
ampoo, it has potential uses in face creams and sunscreen
mpounds.
Pharmaceuticals: It inhibits growth of tubercle bacilli and
is potential for treatment of acne.
Food-related: Cooking oil and a low calorie additive for
lad oil, vegetable oil and shortening are possibilities.
These are just a few applications of jojoba oil. The
}uid wax can be sulferized or used as a solid hydrogenated
ax for polishing wax, cosmetics, and candles. When com-
ned with other waxes it burns with a bright, essentially
nokeless flame.
As for jojoba's liquid wax characteristics:
Color: Crude, light yellow; refined, clear.
Odor: Mild, pleasant, not fishy.
Stability: Does not become rancid after standing for long
eriods; unsaturated and not easily oxidized; not damaged
y repeated heatings to 285°C or by heating for four days
t 370°C; nonvolatile, not assimilated as food by animals.
SOLUBLE IN: Benzene, petroleum ether, chloroform,
arbon tetrachloride, carbon disulfide and hexane.
OIL IN SEED: Does not decrease and properties are
ot altered by storage over several years; approx. 50% oil
ontent in seed.
While sperm oil is becoming increasingly difficult to
iroduce, jojoba seed oil is becoming more economically
easible.14
A growing cosmetic industry, Laboratorios Jojoba, S.A.
Iready exists in Mexico, utilizing jojoba seed oil. In the
Jnited States the Apache Marketing Cooperative Association
s now producing and marketing hand-dipped candles made
&gt;artly with jojoba wax for heat stability.
The jojoba is a very stable plant. In fact it requires little
Mention in semi-arid to arid, well drained regions. In
'953, at Vista California, a small plantation (12 plants) was
ieeded without irrigation and cultivated by hand. Annual
ainfall there averages about 12.5 inches. The shrubs started
'o bloom in 1957, by 1969 all had bloomed. After seven
/ears the female bushes were 33 inches high, the male
rushes 40 inches. After nineteen years, all bushes were
about seven feet in height and eight feet in diameter.15
Extensive research is currently being done by the
Apache Marketing Cooperative Association, the University
of Arizona (Tucson) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture
on speeding the growth of the jojoba plant with Gibberellic
Acid and increasing the yield per acre.16
The jojoba bean is edible. It tastes like . . . acorns.
Sperm whale meat is distinctly inedible. The Russian
whalers grind it into a meal used as a feed on the state fur
farms, which supply half the world's pelts and provide the

casts whale meat as a crucial source of animal protein
for a crowded country on a protein poor diet.1' By
"animal protein" the Japanese mean what we would call
"meat" protein, inclusive of beef, pork, and poultry, but
exclusive of fish and shellfish (since whale meat is more like
beef than like fish, being a mammal rather than fish). The
Japanese eat far more fish and shellfish than "meat". Thus
whale meat is of little importance to the Japanese popula-
tion as a whole.
Whaling produces a total annual income of about $150
million and currently is operating in the red. It accounts for
fewer than 14,000 jobs which could be replaced by the
production of jojoba and other whale substitutes. The
International Whaling Commission seems to be a paper
tiger that might well be replaced by an amendment to the
Law of the Sea for the protection of all marine mammals.

Row, Row, Row, Your Roi
by Greg Werth
Everyone's heard the tune "row, row, row your boat . . . ,"
right? Well students from the Quarterdeck Society, an
honorary society of the Naval Architecture School, and the
student chapter of the American Society of Civil Engineers
(ASCE) have modified this old familiar merry melody to
"row, row, row your rock ..." Well, not quite, but these
students aren't exactly planning to paddle about in your
average canoe. They are presently constructing two cement
canoes, and upon completion, plan to race them in early
spring.
Howdid this all come about? Well, about seven years ago,
civil engineering students at Purdue University challenged
their counterparts at the University of Illinois to a canoe
race, with the stipulations that the students had to build
their own canoes and that they had to be constructed out of
Portland cement. The race was held at Eagle Creek Reservoir
in Indianapolis, Indiana, with Illinois emerging as the
victors of the First Annual Concrete Canoe Race. The
enthusiasm generated was so great that the Purdue student
chapter of ASCE, decided to make the races an annual event
and to invite other mid-western universities with student
chapters of ASCE, including Michigan, to participate in the
future.
At the Second Annual Concrete Canoe Race, Michigan
entered what was the first bulbous bowed canoe ever built,
and most likely the last. (Picture 1) A bulbous bow looks
like a big toe protruding from the bow. The purpose of the
bulb is to eliminate the bow wave. Michigan's canoe finished
fourth in the student division behind Purdue, Illinois, and
Missouri, and second in the faculty division behind Purdue.
Michigan's fine performance was not due to its radical
design. Rather it wasduetothe light weight of the canoe - 157
pounds. That may not seem light until you compare it to
Michigan State's entry that year, the "Behemoth", which

weighed in at a whopping 640 lbs. ^PPar

lack of canoe racing experience posed more ot v
than the actual design of the canoe. Two Michigan

partially immersed in a fluid is buoyed up with a force
jual to the weight of the fluid displaced by the body.
I other words, if the object displaces more fluid (in this
*se water) than it weighs, then it will float. The density
f water is 62.4 lbs. per cubic foot. So, for example, if we
ad a cubic foot of any material, so long as it holds to-
ether, if it weighs less than 62.4 lbs. it will float.
Planning for two canoes, by approximately twenty-two
tudents began in November with the initial construction
ollowing in early January. Two canoes are built in order
o be able to alter or completely redesign the second canoe,
xnsibly making the second superior to the first. There
ire three stages to the entire ordeal: (1) the design of the
anoes, (2) the actual construction of the canoes, and (3)
»nditioning the racers.
Basically the actual construction involves the building
of an intricate wooden framework covered with plastic.
This is in turn covered with wire mesh so the cement has a
good surface to adhere to. (Picture 3) Then the concrete
ls applied and is left to "set out" for three days. (Picture 4)
The density of the concrete used is 90 lbs per cubic foot as
opposed to the typical density of 150 lbs. per cubic foot.
During the "set out" duration the canoe must be kept
oarnp and is therefore watered down frequently and is kept
under a tent of plastic to hinder the evaporation of the
water. After the three day duration the frame is removed
from the mold and the mold is completely submerged in the
Department of Naval Architectures' towing tank in West
Engineering to be cured for about 24 days in 65 to 70
degree water. An interesting feature is the fact
'hat the framework is reusable for making more molds in
^e future. The concrete cures somewhat exponentially in
the sense that after about seven days the canoe is about
70% full strength with the other 30% following in the re-
maining 17 days. Caution must be taken to make sure the
canoe does not cure too rapidly. This happens if the water
is too warm, causing the inside molecular structure to set
up faster than the outside, thus making the canoe very easy
to crack. After curing is complete, the canoe is sanded to get
it smooth and adjust the thickness, as thin as one fourth
of an inch in some places, followed by the application

Take
a lesson
from a tennis pro.
A tennis champion's powerful backhand looks as smooth and
unhurried as a ballerina's graceful bow. What's the secret? Being
in the right position in plenty of time.
"Remember this about the backhand," the pros advise. "Get both feet
around pointing toward the sideline. And always make sure the right foots
forward, so your body doesn't cramp your swing."
Getting into proper position early is good advice for college seniors, too.
Here's the first step:
When companies interview on your campus, make sure they interview you. When The Timken
Company representative stops by, don't let him go without seeing you.
He'll fill you in on our work (maybe your work) with the aerospace, automotive, construction,
chemical industries. Our openings in production, engineering, sales, marketing, finance,

Both of the canoes are symmetric (no differentiation
ween bow and stern) which presents an interesting ad-
itage. If a race requires the team to go to a certain point
I return, rather than turning the whole canoe around at
turning point, the paddlers merely turn themselves
lund and continue, now in the opposite direction.
At present there are 18 potential racers. The Raw Strength
d Courage Kayak Association has volunteered to help
iin the paddlers. The training and instructing takes place
Sunday morning at the North Campus pool. If the
;ather gets warmer the paddlers plan to practice on the
.iron River. At the same time each individual paddler has
s own training program to improve endurance and upper
)dy strength. The races are 1000 yards in length making
pretty much a sprint, but nevertheless requiring a con-
derable amount of endurance.
The annual races for the past six years have been
inctioned by the American Concrete Institute (ACD.asis

itering. One is in Tri-state, Indiana and the other is at
ladison, Wisconsin. The judging at the Madison race is not
)lely based on the race performances, but also on the
ngineering of the canoes.
Combining the engineering excellence of the Civil Engin-
eering Department and the Quarterdeck Society with
Michigan's relentless domination in collegiate athletic com-
petition, those paddlers in their maize and blue canoes
should win it all this spring.

What's That Echo . . . cho. . . o?
by Bill Cowie
In 1927, two American experimenters, A.H. Taylor and
L.C. Young, were probing the ionosphere, listening to the
echoes of radio signals. The echoes appeared to be coming
from the inner Van Allen belt, since the delay times were
hundredths of a second, and were assumed to be natural
phenomena. Later that year. Professor Carl Stormer of
Norway was talking to an engineer named Hals, and men-
tioned these phenomena. Hals replied that he had also
heard echoes while working at Eindhoven, in Holland, but
the delay time of these echoes was about 3 seconds. He
postulated that they, were coming from the moon, but
Stormer disagreed and decided to set up a series of tests
to attempt to find an answer.
After some time, and with help from another man named
Van der Pol, they were again able to pick up the 3 second
echoes. Then, after a few minutes, the echo times began
varying, ranging from 3 to 15 seconds. Van der Pol
repeated the experiment, sending signals at 30 second
intervals, and again received echoes, at exactly the same
wavelength as the signal, and again, with return times
varying, apparently randomly, from 3 to 15 seconds. These
experiments continued for several months, with the last
recorded observations coming from a French expedition
during the solar eclipse of May, 1929. The experimenters
attempted to determine whether these echoes were caused
by natural phenomena and what these phenomena might
be. Unable to do so, it appears that they eventually lost
interest. Much of the data was never published and was
eventually lost.
Then, in 1960, R.N. Bracewell of Stanford University
hypothesized that "if advanced communities were spread
through the Galaxy at distances of 100 light-years or more,
unmanned space probes might be the most effective means
of communication between them. On entering our Solar
System such a probe might listen for our radio signals and
repeat them back to us. The returned signals would appear
to be 'echoes' with delays of several seconds or minutes. If
we returned the signals to it again, it would know it had
established contact with intelligence."1 Several years later,
Duncan A. Lunan, a graduate of Glasgow University,
attempted to interpret the varying delay times of the echoes
as a code. He felt that such a method would be a good
means of communication by intelligent beings, for several
reasons. First, by listening for specific radio signals, the
unmanned probe could assume that it has detected intelli-
gent beings, not background noise or radiation. It is also a
good assumption that if such beings can emit radio signals,
they can also receive them; thus the probe would not waste
its time sending signals which could not be heard. Further
more, Mr. Lunan feels that such a signal is a more efficient
way to send messages than, for instance, a dot and dast
system, and that it would be less likely to be distorts
during transmission.
So Mr. Lunan began by trying to decode the first set
of echoes heard. The echo times, in seconds, were as
follows: 8, 11, 15, 8, 13, 3, 8, 8, 8, 12, 15, 13, 8, a
(The times are given in round numbers because Van der Pol
was using a stopwatch and was unable to be more precise I
Eventually Lunan tried plotting the delay times on the x-axis
of a graph, and the sequence number on the y-axis. (See
Figure 1.) The sequence of 8's appear to be a line, dividing
the graph into two parts. On the left is a single point, and
on the right, Lunan noticed, is a cluster of points which
resembles an incomplete diagram of the constellation
Bootes. When the point on the left is moved from its giwn
position, 5 units to the left of the dividing line, to the
corresponding point 5 units to the right of the line, the
missing star, 6 Bootis, is now in place and the diagram
of the constellation is completed.2 From this, Lunan
concludes that the probe was sent from € Bootis, and that
had someone returned the corrected sequence of signals
to the hypothetical probe, it would have interpreted it as a
signal that we were intelligent enough to communicate
with it. Then, perhaps, it would have started another
program to contact us and send more information.
As a brief background, Bootes is a summer constellation
which can be seen from March through August.
In the
spring it is high in the eastern sky, adjacent to the two
of the Big Dipper (Ursa Major). Its most conspicuous
member is the star commonly known as Arcturus [O-oo

each year, is the brightest star in the sky. e Bootis is

rf arc per year, and gradually increasing. So it is possible
hat the map is simply out of date, and that Arcturus has
loved a perceptible distance since the map was completed.
prom this and other observations, Lunan calculated that
he probe arrived in this solar system around 13,000
fears ago, compiled and stored a star map in its memory,
ind hovered patiently, waiting for some signal of intelligent
life.
Lunan also attempted to decipher other series of signals,
although he was often stymied by data which was never
published and which could not be traced. Other graphs that
he was able to complete show various charts of stars which
seem to confirm that e Bootis is the origin of the hypothe-
tical probe. But most interesting is one of the graphs of
*e data collected by the French expedition, mentioned
earlier. It is not a chart of star configurations, but rather,
an odd series of patterns of dots, which seem to form a
Wpe of puzzle. A very significant part of this diagram,
though, is that it shows an updated chart of Bootes, with
Arcturus in its correct position. Lunan feels that the
interpretation of the logical sequence of the main figure is
very clear, and gives his translation as follows:
Our home is. Epsilon Bootis, which is a double star.
We live on the 6th planet of 7, counting outward
from the sun which is the larger of the two. Our
sixth planet has one moon, our fourth planet has 3,
our first and third planets each have one. Our probe
is in the orbit of your Moon. This updates the
position of Arcturus shown in our maps.
(For an explanation of how he determined this, see the
bibliography.)
If we were to extend our imagination, then, the
following scenario would not be unreasonable. A highly
developed, intelligent form of life has developed on a
planet revolving around one member of a double star.
They realize that their Sun and its partner are nearing the
end of their useful life, and if they are to exist, they must
begin to look for a new place to live. They decide to send
our probes in all directions to distances of hundreds of
light years, and have programmed them not only to seek
out habitable worlds, but also to listen for intelligent beings,
which, perhaps, could aid them in their search.
The probes travel outward, perhaps for only a short
time, or possibly for several centuries, and eventually, by
purpose or by chance, one of them encounters an ordinary
star with 4 planets revolving around it. Following its
program, it approaches more closely to inspect these
planets, and as it moves in, it detects several other planets
which are much smaller. After investigating the primary
planets, it turns its attention to a small planet, the third
one from the star. Although it quickly rules out the planet,
finding it alien and uninhabitable to the beings who sent it,
it does detect the possibility of life. Further tests confirm
that a form of life does exist, and the probe initiates its
operating program. After finding no way to communicate
with this alien form of life, it looks back to the star from
which it came, and compiles a map of the brighter stars
surrounding it. It stores this in its memory, then recedes
to the orbit of the planet's moon, where it becomes quiescent,
patiently waiting for some signal of intelligent life.
Then, after a long wait, it suddenly picks up weak
radio waves. It immediately comes out of hibernation,
and its mission program is reactivated. It curtails its
other sensors, and listens very carefully, but picks up
only random noise. Soon it starts picking up what appear
to be signals. It starts echoing the signals back, but
they keep coming, in random bursts. It is unable to get
the attention of the beings that are sending these signals.
Then, one day, it notices a continuous series of ordered
pulses. The interval between the pulses is too short a
time period to do anything other than to announce its
presence in the orbit of the planet's moon, which it
does by sending echoes of 3 seconds delay - the time it
takes for a signal travelling at the speed of light to travel
from the planet to its moon and back. There is silence
for a while, and when the next set of signals arrives, they
are 20 seconds apart. The probe now has time to send
a more complete message, and sends its puzzle — a chart
of the region of stars from which it came, with its own
star out of place. If it receives a return signal, with the
missing star in its correct place, it will conclude that these
beings are intelligent. But no such signal arrives; instead
it just receives more series of ordered pulses. Undaunted,
it continues to send information, not knowing if the
beings understand it or not. But eventually the signals
stop coming, and again it can detect nothing but random
noise.

Perhaps the probe gave up and left, to continue its
exploration elsewhere. Maybe its builders found what
they were looking for in the meantime, and sent a signal
telling it to shut down, or perhaps to return home. It is
also possible, of course, that the probe is still there,
waiting for another chance to communicate with us. So,
in 1967, the search for long-delayed echoes was taken
up at Stanford University. The results so far have been
disappointing, with only an occasional echo being heard.
Meanwhile, Mr. Lunan is continuing work on decipher-
ing the remaining signals, in hopes that more information
may turn up, but the work is slow and tedious.
Mr. Lunan readily admits that these echo signals may
be simply natural phenomena; that the signals may be
truly random and the patterns illusory. But he points out
that there is as yet no satisfactory explanation for a
natural process which could produce these echoes. "Only
confirmation of the probe's existance," he says, "could
establish that (these) long-delayed echoes were not a
natural phenomenon. ' Furthermore, proof that the probe
exists does not rule out the possibility that echoes can be
caused by a natural process.
Now that the roles are reversed, and it is we who are
attempting to contact the hypothetical probe, Lunan feels
that we should attempt to contact it on some wavelength
other than those heavily used for other purposes, and
that we would have greater chance of succeeding if one
of our more powerful radio telescopes was used, such j
the one at Arecibo. He also suggests that we try somethin
other than radio waves as a means of communicatioi

ments. If we then receive laser "echoes" of various deb
times, and if they again form recognizable charts i
constellations, it would be difficult to regard them i
nothing more than a natural phenomenon.

C-E selfishly offers
you something for
nothing.
r
L,
The Something (Take your choice):
a) A handy metric conversion rule
(value 50C). If you don't know what it is
by now, you shouldn't be graduating.
b) An equally handy booklet of steam
tables (value 90C). If you're the kind of
engineer who doesn't need one, we still
could use your talents at Combustion
Engineering.
Our selfish motives:
When we send you your choice of
something for nothing, we will also include
a handsomely produced brochure which
describes many of the benefits and oppor-
tunities of an engineering career with C-E.
Rush us the coupon right away. After
all, being for nothing, these somethings
may not last very long.

... and then you accept your best offer
and embark on a dignified career.
That used to be the general idea.
Today college may have to be its own reward,
distantly related, if at all, to the problem of
earning a living.
There are exceptions, and as an engineering
graduate you are a prime exception.
In the eyes of the kind of people who run
outfits like Kodak, a B.S. or M.S. in
engineering marks you as a potential
successor of theirs.
Your attractiveness depends on the fact that
your engineering faculty, despite its apparent
friendliness, is out to make things as tough as
they can for you. Yet you SURVIVE!
When the business cycle is up, bare survival
in a rugged engineering curriculum may prove
sufficiently impressive. When it's down, the
bare survivors may find the pickings a little
better than their less technically minded friends
and a little slimmer than they are for the
hotshot who keeps a 3.9 GPA while running
a fleet of garbage trucks in order to support
honorable parents.
If we don't snare that character, it's probably
because an employer almost as desirable as
we are got there first.
To prevent that, waste no time before
dropping a note to Kodak, Business and
Technical Personnel, Rochester, N.Y. 14650.
An equal-opportunity employer (f/m) manufacturing photographic products,
fibers, plastics, and chemicals, with plants in Rochester, N.Y.,
Kingsport, Tenn., Windsor, Colo., Longview, Tex., and Batesville, Ark.


engineers who know
a great opportunity
when they see it.
The more you know about the energy problem, the more you
know that electricity is going to play a larger and larger part
in helping solve it.
Electric power is one of the greatest opportunities in
engineering today.
And as the world's leading manufacturer of products
that generate, distribute and use electricity, General Electric
can offer you opportunities that few other companies can
match.
At GE you might go to work on nuclear power
projects. Or help manufacture nuclear fuels. We're
a world leader in both areas.
Or maybe help develop more efficient steam
turbine-generators. Gas turbines. Combined
cycleplants.
Or one day maybe work on one of
of the new technologies. Like the
fast-breeder reactor. Coal gasifi-
cation. Battery storage for peak-
ing power. Closed-cycle MHD
power generation.
And that's only energy.
There are dozens of exciting:
fields at GE.
You might make your
future helping us build
electric mass-transit cars.
Or cleaner, quieter jet
engines. Or electronic
diagnostic medical devices.
Or better kinds of plastics
like our super-tough Lexan*
resin. Or better kinds of light-
ing systems. Like our Lucalox"
street lamps that help reduce
crime. GE is big in all kinds of
areas you might not have
known about.
But a word about that
word "big." At GE you
don't have to worry about
getting caught in a
"bigness maze." We're
not like some big com-
panies. We're decen
tralized. Into many strategic business
units.
Each one of these GE strategic busi-
ness units has its own management and
business objectives.
What's more, since each business is
part of GE, you have flexibility. If your
work interests change, or you want to
advance by learning a new field, we have
many other businesses you can try.
