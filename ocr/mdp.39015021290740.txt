SELECTED BECAUSE OF ITS I
LIGHTNESS AND STRENGTH \f
I AST YEAR when Settle and Fordney ascended to the
1— stratosphere they were housed in a spherical gondola
built of Dowmetal. Again this year Dowmetal was chosen
for the stratosphere home of those courageous men,
Kepner and Stevens, who so ably represented the National
Geographic Society and the U. S. Army Corps in this
year's exploration aloft.
The same reason was responsible for the choice of Dow-
metal in both instances.
First, this lightest of all structural metals made possible 1500
feet higher flight for every 100 pound reduction in weight.
Second, with its lightness, Dowmetal possessed the strength
and endurance necessary to withstand shock and inside
pressures while being tossed about in the thin air of
the stratosphere.
Third, a variety of forms of fabrication were required,
including castings, forgings, extruded forms, sheet and
plate. And Dowmetal was fabricated in these forms by
processes common in industry.
Dowmetal is equally applicable to the problems of in-,
dustry which require extreme lightness, great strength and
easy fabrication.
Read the story of the flight in the October 1934 issue of
the National Geographic Magazine. Write for descriptive
literature which shows the application of Dowmetal to
your every day problems.

Lockheed "Electra"
By
CLARENCE L. JOHNSON, 32E
Research Engineer
Lockheed Aircraft Corporation
Before starting construction on its latest twin-engine
transport plane, the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation of
Burbank, California, decided to run an extensive series
of wind tunnel tests on the proposed plans at the Uni-
versity of Michigan. The first group of tests was made
under the direction of Professor E. A. Stalker of the
Aeronautical Department in March, 1933, while a later
series of tests was made by the author in October, 1934,
because of changes which had been made in the original
design.
The development of the fast low-wing airplane has
brought forth many problems unique to this type of
ship which can be studied quite well in the wind-tunnel.
In an effort to get the very most of performance out
of their ships, designers have kept fuselages of as small
projected area as possible and in the meantime used
more and more of the fuselage length for carrying
payload. In 1928 about 30% of the fuselage length was
used for carrying a variable load while today we use
75%. This condition makes possible a large variation
in balance of the airplane and gives rise to the two
most serious problems. The first is that of obtaining
satisfactory longitudinal stability, which is influenced
by the rearmost center of gravity position of the air-
plane to a large degree. An unstable ship is dangerous,
especially when flying blind and the United States
Department of Commerce will not license such a ship.
The second is that of getting the tail down on landing
when the ship is loaded so that it is nose heavy. This
condition is dangerous in landing on a muddy field.
A thorough investigation of both these problems was
made in the University tunnel while the ship was still
in the design stage. The usual model tests were made
to determine the high speed and landing speed of the
plane. A one-twelfth size wooden model of the plane
(wing span of 55 inches ) was made and various wind-
shields, wing fillets, nacelles, engine cowls and landing
gears were furnished. Early in the testing stage how-
ever, it was decided to retract the landing gear up into
the motor nacelles in order to lessen the air resistance
and for the sake of safety. It has been proven that in
case of an emergency, it is safer to land with the wheels
up than with them down. The wheels project out of
the nacelles far enough so that the ship on landing
merely knocks off the propellers and slides along on
the wheels without nosing over, as it might in a rough
field with the wheels fully down. On transport lines,
pilots start to retract the landing gear immediately after
taking off, generally when the ship is only twenty-five
feet above the field.
Windshields present a difficult problem not only from
a point of view of fair resistance, but mainly because of
reflection on landing and maneuvering over cities at
night. Quite often in a turn, the pilot cannot see out
of the ship at all because ground lights being reflected
forth and back between the various windshield panels
make every panel a sheet of glare. In studying this ship,
wax was used to make up various types of windshields
and finally one was chosen which had a fairly satisfac-
tory drag and which was well designed from a point of
view of glare when flying into the sun and when land-
ing at night.
All the tests on the "Electra" model were made with
the eight foot wind-tunnel and at a speed of 80 miles
per hour. At this speed, the model had a minimum drag
in the high speed condition of less than one and one-
quarter pounds. At the landing angle with the wing
flaps set 45° the model would lift 105 pounds. These
forces scaled up to the size of the real ship made pos-
sible the calculation of the high speed of the airplane

engines and propellers. From the tunnel tests the top
speed was calculated as 224 miles per hour at an alti-
tude of 5,000 feet with two supercharged engines of
400 horsepower each and controllable pitch propellers.
The landing speed with a gross weight of 9,000# was
computed as 60.4 miles per hour. The author was
project engineer on the test flights which have just
been completed and in an extended series of tests he
found the actual high speed to be 221 miles per hour
and the landing speed to be 60 miles per hour for the
given gross weight.
One of the things brought out by the wind-tunnel
tests and substantiated in flight tests, is the remarkable
efficiency of the late type twin-engine airplane com-
pared with the single engine planes of the same horse-
power. If one 800 horsepower engine were placed in
the "Electra" instead of the two 400 horsepower en-
gines, the top speed would be only ten miles per hour
more than it is. To counteract this loss in speed, we
have gained the ability to fly with full load should one
engine cut out, greater quietness, better handling char-
acteristics on the ground, excellent visibility for the
pilots and more room for carrying baggage. To secure
these advantages it was necessary to locate the engine
nacelles very carefully with regard to the wing and
fuselage. This was entirely a wind-tunnel problem and
over twenty tests were run to determine the best loca-
tion, shape of nacelle and type of engine cowling to
use. The difference between the best and the worst
combinations of the above was enough to account for a
difference in top speed of the airplane of 25 miles per
hour.
A peculiar type of flow was found to exist between
the nacelle and fuselage when the airplane was in the
climbing position. This flow was studied by attaching
short pieces of thread to the model and observing the
altitude they assumed when the wind was turned on.
Smoke was also introduced at the point to be studied
through a small glass tube. Inasmuch as the flow over
the tail was detrimentally effected it was necessary to
investigate means of eliminating or changing the flow
conditions between the nacelle and fuselage. Small air-
foils running between the nose of the ship and the
engine cowling and some cantilevered out from the side
of the ship were used in an effort to improve the flow.
While some showed slight promise they increased the
drag of the ship by unbelievable amounts—20% at
the high speed angle of attack for one of the best
airfoils used.
Finding that the flow could not be changed without
a prohibitive increase in drag, a study was made of
the horizontal tail to see what could be done to get
better tail efficiency to counteract the poor flow over it.
Some improvement was obtained by placing the tail
higher up on the fuselage. A tail of greater area was
tried but not adopted because of the fear of tail flutter.
It was then discovered that by placing vertical plates
near the tips of the horizontal tail, that the tail efficiency
was increased remarkably. These tip shields prevented
the spillage of air from the high pressure side of the
tail to the low pressure side and materially improved
the longitudinal stability. It was later decided to make
these tip shields act also as the usual fin and rudder,
removing the conventional fin and rudder. By doing
the latter, a better flow was obtained over the middle
of the horizontal tail, which was a further gain. The
drag of all the tail surfaces using the tip shield-rudder
combination is less than that of the conventional type
of tail surfaces.
The one main objection to using the tip shields was
that with their weight out at the end of the horizontal
tail would so lower the natural frequency of vibration
of the latter that trouble would be encountered with
tail flutter. These fears were groundless. The author
has watched the tail for flutter in dives up to a speed
of 298 miles per hour and in every other condition of
flight but in one hundred hours of testing not a sign
of flutter was seen.
Shielding the elevator tips and having the rudder
directly in the propeller slipstream make for excellent
controlability and small control forces.
The part that the wind-tunnel plays in the develop-
ment of modern airplanes is well shown in the Lock-
heed "Electra."
Backstage at the
Stadi
um
By
ARTHUR WILL, '36E
Who of our numbers could journey over to the south
end of Main Street, enter the sunken garden of the
gridiron which is our stadium, and sit thru a football
game without wondering about the Scoreboard, the
press box, the public address system, and similar points
of interest to the engineer? We have wondered about
them, and, having wondered, have investigated; having
investigated, we proceed to pass on the fruits of our
labor.
It was in the season of 1927 that the new stadium
was first put into use, whereupon it became readily
apparent that the facilities for handling large crowds
were remarkable. The combination of ten main gates.
most stadium exits on ground level, and a particularly
strategic street and highway layout in the vicinity were
making it possible for the multitude provided for by

porary bleachers to be handled with extraordinary ease.
But the center of our curiosity is probably the press
box. There we find accommodations for the reporters
and their telegraph operators, radio announcers, the
scoreboard operator, and the public address announcer,
all requiring considerable in the way of technical equip-
ment. The latter three groups, incidentally, are all
provided with outlets for the reports telephoned from
the sidelines by the young chap you see constantly striv-
ing to keep this long wire more or less untangled as he
follows the play. He is a football expert provided by
the athletic department, usually a former player.
The first scoreboard in use was a very simple affair,
merely providing a place for appropriate numbers to be
hung manually, a system scarcely in keeping with so
magnificent a stadium. About that time, along came
Franke Burke, of Berrien Springs, Michigan, a sopho-
more enrolled in the E. E. Department. He had been
responsible for the design of a couple of small electric
scoreboards for high schools in the state, and proceeded
to produce a design very similar to the one finally built.
Unfortunately, his technical education had not pro-
gressed to the point where he could handle a project
of such complexity, and so Professors Holland and
Keeler of the Engineering College took over the work
and turned out the final design. At the same time,
arrangements were made to complete the technical set-
up to its present form, and ever since Prof. Holland
has been in charge of its maintenance. Life pulled one
of its meanest tricks on Burke, who was forced to drop
out of school before his brain-child reached actuality.
In order to provide rapid and flexible control for so
elaborate a board a rather complex set-up is required.
As a result, in the two boards there are a total of about
400 magnetic relays and 1,100 lamps, and each board
has its own transformer. The hemispherical extremity
of each lamp protrudes from the foremost metal sheet-
ing forming the front of the boards, arranged in such
a way that any one of the ten numerals can be formed
by illuminating the proper lamps.
In the top row of the press box is seated the opera-
tor, with his assistant; on either side of him is a metal
box with a number of buttons on its top. The one on
the left has a painted miniature of the scoreboard with
a button in the place of each figuregram; on the right
is simply one key for each of the ten numerals. To
put up any figure, he first presses the key on the left
corresponding to the desired figuregram, which removes
any figure which may be in that space at the time, and
then connects that figuregram to the right-hand key-
board; pressing any one of the ten keys causes the
corresponding numeral to appear. These buttons con-
trol everything except the ovals indicating possession
of the ball; they are operated by a simple two-throw
switch.
Registering a Close Contest
The system was first placed in use in the season of
1930, although at that time the relays were not com-
pleted and it was necessary to operate each board man-
ually: next season, however, it was in normal use.
Since then, all the button pushing has been done by
either of two local men-about-town, Messrs. William
Snyder and Walter Gross.
The public address system is one of the most success-
ful ever devised for addressing an assemblage of this
size, as all who have heard it will agree. A fourteen-
tube amplifier delivers 200 watts of audio power to
fourteen 12 inch dynamic speakers on the roof of the
press box. By locating all the speakers within a few
feet of each other, all trouble due to interference be-
tween speakers at varying distances from the listener
is eliminated, and excellent reception results. The an-
nouncing is done by former players, Edwin Poorman
and Alvin Dalhan having officiated thus far. Operation
of phonograph records is also provided for.
In addition to the public address announcer, perma-
nent booths are provided for four radio announcers,
with more available temporarily. With chain hook-ups,
as many as 96 stations have broadcast the game at one
time. In addition, nearly a hundred press reporters,
each with his operator, are provided with a telegraph
line and—think of this the next time you sit thru a
game in cold weather—an electric heater. As the re-
porter writes his story of the game, his operator sends
it over the wires in the usual telegraphic code. All of
this requires an assemblage of wire communication
lines which makes a fair-sized switching exchange of
the press box, trunk lines being furnished by the tele-
phone and telegraph companies.
Perhaps knowing all this won't make a lot of differ-
ence in the way you enjoy your football games. It's
sufficient, no doubt, to realize that Michigan's stadium
is worthy of Michigan's teams. But just the same we
hope we've told you some things you wanted to know
about.

Properties of Steel
By
JOHN CHIPMAN. Ph.D.
Dept. of Engineering Research
The manufacture of steel from iron ore is a process
involving alternate oxidation and reduction. The iron
oxide of the ore is reduced by carbon monoxide in the
blast furnace and so powerful is the reducing action
that not only iron but also a number of other elements,
particularly silicon and phosphorous are also reduced
and absorbed by the liquid iron. To convert the pig
iron into steel, these elements must be removed and
so must also the three or four per cent of carbon which
the iron has dissolved. Removal is accomplished by
oxidation either by means of air in a converter of the
Kelley-Bessemer or Thomas type, or by means of iron
oxide in the open-hearth furnace. In neither case is it
possible to add just the right amount of oxygen to
react with the impurities which we are seeking to re-
move. A large excess of the oxidizing agent must be
used and by the time the silicon is oxidized out and
the carbon and phosphorous have been "knocked down"
to about the desired proportions, the liquid steel—the
"bath" as steel makers call it—contains very consider-
able quantities of dissolved iron oxide. The presence of
this ferrous oxide in the steel affects its manner of
solidification in the ingot and also the mechanical prop-
erties of the finished steel.
For certain types of steel a high oxygen content is
desirable and the heat may be tapped with its dissolved
ferrous oxide still in it. This results in an "open" or
"rimming" steel which is effervescent during its solidi-
fication due to the evolution of carbon monoxide gas.
For other kinds of steel such as the forging and carbur-
Laboratory set-up used in research
izing grades and all medium and high carbon steels,
the iron oxide constitutes an objectionable impurity
which must be removed before the heat is tapped. Its
removal is accomplished by the addition of certain re-
ducing agents or "deoxidizers" among which may be
listed manganese, silicon, titanium, zirgonium, and alum-
inum. These elements differ among themselves as to
their deoxidizing efficiencies, and the properties of the
resultant steel are dependent to a marked degree upon
the manner in which the deoxidation is performed.
Another element whose affects upon the properties of
the finished steel are just beginning to be appreciated
is nitrogen. As in the case of oxygen it seems quite
possible that for certain purposes its presence in steel is
altogether desirable. In other respects it is definitely ob-
jectionable. At all events, it must be recognized as a
potent alloy element whose proportions should be under
control of the steel maker. Sulfur and phosphorous
have been under careful control for many years and
they are always determined in the routine analysis of a
steel sample. That the steel maker has been slower in
learning to control the oxygen and nitrogen content of
his product has been due in no small measure to the
difficulties in the analytical determination of these two
elements.
The Bureau of Standards in Washington and the
Aachen Technische Hochschule in Germany have pio-
neered the development of an interesting method for
the determination of both oxygen and nitrogen in steels.
The specimen to be analyzed is melted under high
vacuum in a graphite crucible and under these conditions
all of the oxides which it contains are reduced and
their oxygen evolved as carbon monoxide. Simultan-
eously, any nitrogen and hydrogen which are present
are liberated. The gases are pumped out by means
of a mercury diffusion pump, collected and analyzed
by any one of a number of methods.
The apparatus which has been in use here for the
past three years by the Department of Engineering
Research is shown in the photograph. The compli-
cated system of glass tubing and stop-cocks which occu-
pies most of the picture is the analytical system. By
means of the two-stage mercury diffusion pump the
gases which have been evolved from the specimen are
circulated through hot copper oxide to convert hydro-
gen to steam and CO to C02; thence through phos-
phorous pentoxide to absorb the water vapor and

sures are accurately measured before and after each
absorption and since the volume of the apparatus is
known the amount of each gas is obtained; the residue
after absorption is nitrogen.
The interesting feature of the apparatus is the induc-
tion furnace, at the extreme right of the photograph,
in which the sample is melted. It consists of a vacuum-
tight silica tube surmounted by a water-cooled brass
cap which is sealed to the glass parts by a removable
wax joint. Inside the quartz tube is a crucible of pure
graphite mounted upon a specially designed magnesia
base. Power is supplied to the water-coo'.ed copper
spiral surrounding the tube from a 35 k.v.a. high fre-
quency generator of the mercury arc type. The crucible
itself is heated by induction and no difficulty is expe-
rienced in reaching a temperature of 3500° F. At this
temperature the gases which are always associated with
graphite are pumped out. The temperature is then
dropped to 3000° F. for the actual analysis. When the
pressure in the furnace is below 0.001 millimeter the
sample is admitted; it melts rapidly and within ten to
twenty minutes the gases have all been pumped out and
collected in the storage bulbs and the pressure has re-
turned to its initial low figure. The mercury diffusion
pump with which the gases were removed from the
sample is now used as the circulating mechanism for
their absorption and analysis.
The apparatus has been used mainly as a tool for
rsearch in studying chemical reactions involving oxygen
and nitrogen in liquid steel, and in developing methods
for their control or elimination in practical operating
processes. Some typical analyses are listed in the table.
The weight percentages are numerically small but often
large enough to have very pronounced effects upon
mechanical properties. The significance of some of
these small figures may be better appreciated if we con-
sider the volumes of the gases which they represent.
Thus when the gases obtained from the sample of
stainless steel listed in the table are measured at atmos-
pheric pressure it is found that they occupy 320 per
cent of the volume of the steel itself.

Prof. Charles H. Fessenden
Jan. 28, 1885—July 26, 1934
No longer will our esteemed friend and teacher meet
his classes in Thermodynamics, Steam Boilers, Refrig-
eration and Air-conditioning. No longer will the stu-
dents in the Mechanical Engineering Department be
able to acquire the knowledge and philosophy of engi-
neering as only Professor Fessenden could give from
his wide experience as an eminent but modest authority
in his own field of endeavor. Not only his students
but also his colleagues highly regarded the man "for his
outstanding personal qualities of loyalty, courtesy, kind-
ness and quiet dignity, as well as his professional at-
tainments, teaching ability, and cooperative spirit."
(from records of The Board of Regents)
He was born in St. Louis, Missouri, on January 28,
1885, and attended Clinton Public School. At an early
age he exhibited a desire and ability for mechanical
knowledge. He received his preparatory work at the
St. Louis Manual Training High School and graduated
at the head of his class in 1902. He began his college
career in Washington University; but received his B.S.
degree from the University of Missouri, 1906. He
specialized in Power Plants and their design under the
direction of Prof. A. M. Greene, Jr.. and received his
Master's degree in 1908.
He l&gt;egan his actual career as an engineer in the Plant
Department of the New York Telephone Co. Soon
after he was employed by the Stirling Boiler Co. which
became consolidated with the Babcock-Wilcox Co. He
served as boiler and machine tool designer and esti-
mator, and later as checker of all designs in this con-
cern until he became affiliated with the University of
Michigan as Instructor in Mechanical Engineering,
1908. Except for a period of eighteen months Pro-
fessor Fessenden has been on the Engineering College
Staff for twenty-six years. He had a very excellent
Army career. During our country's engagement in the

Captain of Ordnance, and Superintendent of Power.
Later he was promoted to the rank of Major in the
Reserve Corps. On his return to the University in
1919 he was appointed Professor of Mechanical Engi-
neering after having served as Assistant Professor
from 1912 to 1917.
Many of his publications on boilers, steam flow
through nozzles, pulverized fuel, steam power plant
equipment, refrigeration and air conditioning have ap-
peared in some of the most prominent engineering
journals, periodicals and our own Michigan Technic.
His principal work was an authoritative treatise on
"Valve Gears" which was considered to be an impor-
tant volume, contributing to the fund of knowledge on
the subject. He had an extraordinary capacity for
work and achieved remarkable success in the field of
research.
He held executive positions in the Detroit section of
the A.S.M.E. and was a member of the A.S.H. &amp; V.E.,
A.S.R.E. and S.P.E.E. His recreation was mainly
golf, he being a member of the Barton Hills Country
Club He was active in the Junior Research Club and
the Faculty Club on the campus. He was a member of
Alpha Tau Omega Fraternity and of the Royal Arch
Masons.
His sudden passing leaves "a big empty place in the
hearts" of the faculty and the students, as a fellow
teacher so aptly stated our common loss of Professor
Charles H. Fessenden. The Board of Regents ex-
pressed officially, for the University, its deepest sym-
pathy and tribute to the man, to his parents and brother
with the following fitting words in a formal resolution
of August 31, 1934, "—they hereby record their sense
of the great loss which the University of Michigan has
suffered by the untimely removal of a skilled teacher,
an eminent engineering authority and a man whose
modest competence, kindly courtesy, and upright char-
acter, commanded the affection and respect of all who
knew him."
IOOO° Turbine Opens New Field
for Materials
By
A. FRANCIS KLUTE, *35E
At the Delray Power House No. 3 of the Detroit
Edison Co. there is installed a Thomson-Houston steam
turbine, which has been in successful operation for the
last three years on steam furnished at the thottle at a
temperature of 1000° Fahrenheit. The reader may
justly ask what is unusual about that temperaure and
why it is used. In the study of thermodynamics and in
actual experience in central station operation, engineers
have found that high temperature steam is more desir-
able than low temperature because: more energy is
available for transformation into work, for any speci-
fied exhaust pressure; a larger portion of this available
energy can be utilized; and less erosion of the turbine
blades in the low pressure stages is produced. Prior to
1930 leading designers agreed that 750° operation was
as high as the standardized materials for turbines, super-
heaters and connecting piping could be thermally stressed
in order to prevent ultimate failure due to creep and cor-
rosive destruction at the higher temperatures proposed
by theory. The initial purpose of the experiment made
by this concern was to accurately determine the effects
of the high temperature of 1000° on available special
alloys and metals used in the fabrication of power plant
equipment.
The experiment was divided into two parts. To gain
preliminary experience in the effect of high superheat
on tubes, pipes, and pipe fittings, a small oil fired super-
heater was installed at the company's Trenton Channel
Plant. The superheater furnished by the Babcock and
Wilcox Co. was of the radiant type, containing 153
sq. ft. of refractory covered heating surface and capable
of raising 6000 lbs. of steam per hour from 700° at
400 lbs. per sq. in. abs pressure. The accompanying
high temperature piping system contains fifty feet of
pipe, a valve, eight flanged pipe joints and a desuper-
heater, which are used to return the high temperature
steam to the main house lines at 700° for use in the
regular turbines. The metallurgical data, obtained in
the examination of materials in use on this preliminary
installation, were used as a basis of the design and the
selection of materials of the Delray equipment.
The Delray installation consists of an oil fired Bab-
cock &amp; Wilcox superheater, interconnecting high tem-
perature piping system and the 10,000 kvv. Thomson-
Houston turbo-generator set as shown in the isometric
view in Figure 1. The condenser, piping, auxiliary
pumps and stage feedwater heaters are shown diagram-
atically in Figure 2. The superheater is capable of

raising 90,000 Ibs. of steam per hour from 700° 10
1100° at a maximum working pressure of 455 Ibs. per
sq. in. gage. It contains 3,957 sq. ft. of heating sur-
face. The superheater is divided into three sections;
the top convection section, the middle combined radiant-
convection section and the bottom radiant section. Ail
these sections are connected in series and the furnace
proper is of the single pass type with no heat traps.
No. 6 industrial fuel oil is burned by means of me-
chanical atomization in three burners, which obtain
maximum combustion by the added effect of induced
draft to that furnished by a high stack.
A cross section drawing of the turbine, which takes
steam at its throttle under a pressure of 365 Ibs. per
sq. in. gauge and at a temperature of 1000° Fahren-
heit, can be seen in Figure 3. The drawing shows a
horizontal-compound impulse turbine, with a total o-f
twenty stages. The high pressure cylinder with the
governor and throttle valve is shown on the left and the
low pressure cylinder is on the right. At the ninth,
fourteenth and seventeenth stages steam is bled off into
the three horizontal four-pass type feedwater heaters,
where the condensate from the turbines condenser is
preheated before injection into one of the regular sta-
tion boilers. The turbine's normal speed is 3600
R.P.M,. driving a 12,500 kva. generator which delivers
current to the house lines at 4800 volts and 60 cycles.
An exhaust pressure of one inch of mercury, absolute,
is maintained by a two-pass 8000 sq. ft. surface con-
denser. The turbine speed is controlled by a flyball
type of governor, operating directly from the turbine
shaft. The governing is by the partial admission or the
cut-out method, which is accomplished by five control
valves, operated by means of a camshaft driven by an
oil-servo motor which in turn is actuated by the gov-
ernor.
There are three important features of the turbine to
be noted in the cross-sectional view. These are: the
amount of shaft packing at the high pressure end of the
turbine, the oversize first stage wheel which of itself
delivers 848 kw., and the double casing on the high
pressure cylinder. The high pressure end packing was
purposely designed long enough to allow the leak off
steam to cool the shaft in its locality, to prevent the
No. 1 bearing from becoming overheated. A double
casing was provided to overcome the extreme heat ex-
pansion effects, which would otherwise endanger the
blading at such a temperature of 1000°. This method
allows free expansion of the inner casing; but insures
a tight joint at the flange of the outer casing.
High pressure steam and a small quantity of satur-
ated steam, which leaks into the first stage from the
saturated steam sealing space, is supplied to the turbine
on the high pressure side. This expands through the
high pressure stages and then is carried by means of a
flexible pipe to the low pressure stages, through which
it expands successively to the condenser. All the steam
expands completely, except that which is bled off for
feedwater heating purposes, and is then condensed to
water. The condensate is then picked up by the hot-
well pump and forced through the feedwater heaters
at boiler pressure. Special water weighing tanks were
installed in the system, to determine the actual heat
rate while the feedwater heaters were in operation. A
very good illustration of the path of the steam through
the turbine and its auxiliaries can be seen in the line
diagram of Figure 2. This shows clearly how the
steam is bled off for use in the heaters and then re-
turned to the station's main feed system.

Fig. 3. Cross-section view of 10,000 kw. 1000° turbine
was designed, the austenitic, 18 per cent chromium and
8 per cent nickel alloy steel, under the commercial name
of Nirosta KA2 was the ideal material recommended
for high temperature equipment. In spite of many
difficulties in fabrication it was used for the superheater
tubes in the radiant section, where the temperature
ranges from 1650° to 1100°.
In all the sections of the superheater where the tem-
perature never reached over 800°, the tubing consisted
of low carbon steel ordinarily recommended by the
A.S.M.E. code. Rezistal 2C, a material differing from
KA2 only m its higher carbon and silicon contents, was
used for loose companion flanges (reinforcing pipe
joints), valves and desuperheater castings. As the re-
sult of creep tests made by our own University of
Michigan Industrial Research Department, Seminolc
hard, a chrome-tungsten-vanadium steel, which when
heat treated gives a yield point around 200.000 Ibs. per
sq. in., was used for the bolted joints. This material
resists creep or plastic flow at 1000° Fahrenheit with a
stress of 7000 Ibs. per sq. in. Sheet Monel metal of
1/32 in. thickness was found to be the most suitable
gasket material for this initial installation at the Tren-
ton Channel Plant.
From the experience with the materials used at Tren-
ton Channel, the Company's engineers found it neces-
sary to modify the analysis of the 18-8 alloy. Failure
occurred in parts made of this material, subject to cor-
rosive gases due to intercrystalline corrosion. This type
of failure was believed to have been the result of the
precipitation of chromium carbides at crystal boundar-
ies. KA2S alloy was then specified for the hotter sec-
tion of the Delray superheater and piping between
superheater and turbine, which was similar to Nirosta
KA2, but contained more silicon to counteract the
effects of the sulphur present in the fuel oil, and less
carbon (0.06 per cent) to prevent chrome-carbide pre-
cipitation. KA2B, containing 2.0-2.5 per cent silicon,
was used for the middle and lower sections of the
superheater to give extra protection against sulphur
corrosion; these sections being more exposed to the
open flames.
In building the original high temperature superheater
for the Trenton Channel Plant installation, it was im-
possible to obtain tubes of suitable length, on account
of the difficulty encountered in drawing the high chro-
mium and nickel alloys. In an effort to protect the sur-
faces of ordinary low carbon steel tubing which is
easily fabricated, an alloy of 18-8 and 12-14 per cent
chromium stainless steel was applied to some unit tubes
with a Schoop metal spray gun, which gave a surface
capable of withstanding 1600° without excessive corro-
sion. Several other unit tubes were coated with
aluminum in a process called calorizing. This process
consists of placing the tubes to be treated in a retort,
in which finely divided aluminum is present, in a high
temperature reducing atmosphere. The aluminum
gradually permeates into the surface of the tubing and
forms an aluminum alloy in solid solution with the
steel. This new surface, when exposed to the corrosive
gases of the superheater furnace, has a thin coating
of aluminum oxide, known as alumina, which prevents
the oxidizing medium from injuring the low carbon
steel of the tube. Very good results were obtained
with the tubes treated in this manner, which had been
installed in the Delray superheater.
Brown-Firth Laboratories in cooperation with Thom-
son-Houston Co., the builders of the turbine, selected
the high temperature materials for the turbine itself.
After many time yield tests, they selected a nickel -
chromium-molybdenum alloy for the turbine throttle
valve, the high pressure shaft packing case, the inner
and outer high-pressure cylinders, and the forged rotor.
This alloy creep resistance of 5600 Ibs. per sq. in. at

per sq. in. The turbine's wheel blading and nozzle
partitions were made from 0.25 per cent carbon, 14 per
cent chromium stainless steel; but the first stage wheel
blading was made from Hecla ATV1 containing 0.47
per cent carbon, 11.8 per cent chromium and 36.3 per
cent nickel, to give added protection against the ex-
treme effects of entering 1000° superheated steam.
On the whole there were few difficulties with the
turbine which could be attributed to the high tempera-
tures used. However, after some time of operation,
growth of the throttle valve packing sleeve caused the
throttle to bind. But this was replaced by a nitrided
steel sleeve, which upon future examination, after long
service, showed no signs of growth due to the high
temperature. Various small bushings had to be re-
placed; but these replacements can usully be expected
on experimental turbines. Great care was taken, in
making measurements of the various parts of the instal-
lation, to determine the creep under actual operating
conditions, in an effort to correlate the operating data
with that obtained in the laboratory.
The operation of this unit with its superheater, con-
denser and auxiliary equipment was by no means more
economical than the regular power plant units, fur-
nishing electricity in the company's territory. This can
be accounted for in the fact that the unit was small
and experimental in its nature and fuel oil was used
as fuel instead of cheaper bituminous coal. The engi-
neers under whose supervision the experiment was
made sincerely believe that in the near future larger
units operating at 1000° or higher temperatures will be
practical and that their development only awaits the
perfection of the high temperature materials needed
and the developments of more economic methods of fab-
ricating these alloys. Like so many progressive pro-
jects of the present day this 1000° turbine points to a
new "Age of Materials," wherein the chemical, the me-
chanical and the electrical engineer will cooperate to
produce new and extraordinary heat resisting materials.

Attention Grads . . .
Who's Where among Michigan Engineers
New and worried faces, fresh and more beautiful
girls, and a noticeable change in the color of the
trees about the campus can only mean one thing, a
new school year has arrived, whether we like it or
not. The worried faces belong to the freshmen who
are not altogether sure of themselves as yet and
perhaps a trifle homesick. The improvement in the
charm of co-eds is questionable, and is probably
more or less a halucination because we have been
away from them for the summer, and of course there
are always a few beautiful ( ?) freshmen women who
dare to venture abroad. Of course the trees change
color regardless of the freshmen and the co-eds, but
nevertheless they are worthy of note because they
can be depended upon to remind us of the impend-
ing struggle with ME3, or CE2 or what have you,
so we had to mention them.
Now grads, does this feeble bit of rumination
make you feel the least bit homesick for the sight
of the Arch or the Library, or any other campus
landmark? If so, we would be really glad to have
you pay us a visit in the office this fall Homecoming
Weekend (Illinois game—Oct. 27), or if you are
not one of those fortunate enough to be able to see
the campus again, please drop us a line and tell us
where you are and what you are doing. And so to
the dope we have secured over the summer.

"Down Where the Blue Begins"
Some men go down to the sea in ships—but not Dr.
William Beebe and Mr. Otis Barton. Last August 15,
several miles southeast of Bermuda, Dr. Beebe and
Mr. Barton climbed into their 2-ton steel diving ball
and allowed themselves to be lowered to a depth of
3,028 feet into the blue waters of the Atlantic. The
depth reached greatly exceeded that of their own rec-
ord dive of 2,510 feet made four days previously. But
it was not for the sake of a record that these men
sought to penetrate to regions never before viewed by
by the eyes of man. "Down where the blue begins,"
nearly a half mile beneath the surface of the Atlantic,
live thousands of strange creatures about which modern
science knows as little as it does of the nature of the
inhabitants of distant Mars. It was for the purpose
of observing these unknown denizens of the watery
world and collecting valuable data that these dives were
sponsored by the National Geographic Society and the
New York Zoological Society.
With the aid of a powerful electric searchlight Dr.
Beebe and Mr. Barton looked out through the quartz
windows of the steel Bathysphere upon a world of
wonders. Throughout the dive, which lasted 2 hours
and 46 minutes, Dr. Beebe was in communication by
telephone with an assistant on the barge. He dictated
many thousands of words describing the various fish
that swam across his field of vision. At the 2,750 foot
level he reported an amazingly large fish fully 20 feet
long which he stated was probably the largest living
thing ever seen in the deep sea.
Carried inside the Bathysphere for the purpose of
purifying the air were several tanks, each containing
80 gallons of oxygen compressed to 1900 pounds pres-
sure. The internal air was kept circulating by means
of an electric blower, through sieve-bottom trays in
which purifying chemicals (calcium-chloride and Wil-
son soda lime) were placed. An automatic recording
device was used for accurate data on temperature and
humility.
Aluminum Foil Protects Tanks
Almost every day someone thinks of a new use for
that versatile metal—Aluminum. In the form of foil
it is both heat-reflecting and moisture-proof so it's
being used in the oil fields for protecting and keeping
cool the great tanks in which are stored millions of
gallons of oil. A suitable adhesive, a thin tar-like
preparation, is applied to the tank and allowed to stand
until it becomes tacky. Strips of foil are then laid
so that they overlap and pressed firmly with a squeegee.
Workmen find it necessary because of the reflection to
wear dark glasses while applying the foil. Tests show
that the loss by evaporation amply justifies the appli-
cation of the foil.

When Henry Ford required illumination of a color
almost identical to that of daylight for his World's
Fair exhihition building, engineers scratched their
heads and swore gently under their breaths. In the
short space of a month they were asked to do what in
the ordinary course of events would be accomplished
only after months of painstaking research. For some
time preliminary research and engineering work had
been in progress for the development of a special high-
pressure mercury vapor lamp but there still remained
many problems that had to be solved before this lamp
could be manufactured successfully. This lamp, when
used in combination with the ordinary tungsten fila-
ment lamp, produces the daylight with which Mr. Ford
wished to illuminate his displays in order that their
true color harmonies might be as easily apparent within
the building as under normal driving conditions.
The lamp has no filament. It consist of a hollow
glass cylinder, almost 13 inches long and about 2 inches
in diameter. Inside this tube is an innertube, also of
glass, in which is placed a drop of mercury. During
operation an arc is established between the electrodes
in opposite ends of the innertube. Aftr the extreme
heat vaporizes the mercury the arc assumes a pencil
shape along the length of the innertube, setting up an
electronic discharge that results in a brilliant glow of
bluish-white light.
The first difficulty was that of securing a glass that
would not soften when subjected to the high tempera-
ture of the mercury arc. When a satisfactory glass
was discovered more obstacles appeared. It was found
that the lead-in wires could not be sealed absolutely
air-tight with the hard glass. Knowing that metal will
seal tightly with Uranium glass and that Uranium
glass can be sealed to other glass, the engineers at-
tempted to fit Uranium cups to the ends of the hard
glass cylinders only to find that the glass at the weld
would crystalize, forming a pithy construction which
lent itself to leaks and cracks. Only after many days
was a technique developed by which the two kinds of
glass were joined at precisely the right temperature to
prvent crystallization.
Standard 500-watt lamp and new mercury lamp.
A delicate operation was the determination of the
weight of the drop of mercury to be inserted into the
innertube. Since it was desired that the lamp operate
at a specific voltage the weight of the droplet had lo
be very closely controlled so that when the mercury
was vaporized a certain pressure existed within the
tube. The weight of this mercury globule is such that,
when fully vaporized by the arc, it fills the innertube
to a pressure of one atmosphere. At this pressure the
lamp operates at a constant voltage of approximately
155 volts.
The final operation in the construction is the cleans-
ing process. Ordinary washing with water isn't thor-
ough enough. Impurities lurking in the microscopic
surface depressions of the tube might combine with the
mercury vapor and as a result cause discoloration of
the light or jeopardize the voltage normally required
for operation. Rare gases are inserted into the tube
and the electrodes heated. The impurities are vaporized
and withdrawn along with the gas. After flushing
several times the mercury globule is introduced and
the tube is sealed. The innertube is then assembled
with the large bulb and its base.
New High Speed Train
From Russia comes word of a new development in
the field of high-speed rail transportation. A Russian
engineer has designed a train to run on balls instead
of wheels. The large ball-shaped members are to run in
concrete troughs of semi-circular cross-section. Accor-
ding to the inventor the new cars will be able to round
curves safely at 200 m.p.h.
A complete lighting unit—3 500-watt lamps and 2 mercury lamps.
Recently a patent was granted in Germany for a pro-
cess by which bread is frozen with dry ice. The bread
is said to be as good as new when it is thawed out.

We advertise in order that the public may
better understand what the Bell System is
doing, and why it does it. In this way we
keep customers and prospective customers
informed of our aims, policies and progress.
We advertise in order to aid the telephone
customer in making the best possible use of
his service. As our advertising influences
one person after another to use the tele-
phone more effectively, the service ren-
dered every other user is correspondingly
improved.
We advertise because we have a varied
service to sell and by selling more of it we
increase its value to each user. Because of
the nature of the telephone business, it is
our duty to inform the public continuously
of the character and varied kind of service
we provide.
In line with this broad plan, we find real
opportunity in addressing messages to col-
lege and university people in their own pub-
lications, just as we also vary our advertising
for women's magazines, farm papers and so
on. 1934-35 is the fifteenth year during
which the Bell System has published adver-
tisements which take college men behind

College Review
Engineering Enrollment Shows Cain
The total enrollment in the College of Engineering
exceeds last year's hy more than 150, showing a net
increase of 14 per cent. With 329 enrolling in the
Class of '38E, a gain of 68, or 26 per cent over last
year's figures, was attained.
In all but two departments figures indicate an in-
crease, Chemical and Mechanical Enginering heading
the list with an increment of 12 students each. From
247 in Mechanical and 215 in Chemical enrollment
rose to 259 and 227 respectively. Both the Civil and
Electrical Engineering departments suffered a decrease,
the former dropping from 121 to 104, the latter from
154 to 147.
In the comhined curricula group Engineering Busi-
ness Administration jumped to six, while Engineering
Mechanics and Engineering Law both increased one.
The new course, offered in combined Forestry and Engi-
neering, failed to attract any students, no one as yet
enrolling in that department. The Aeronautical de-
partment, after dropping heavily in the past three years,
came back to 176 students as compared to 172 for last
year.
o
University Glider Club
At the National Soaring Meet, held June 23 to July
9 of this last summer, the University of Michigan
Glider Club took third place. Those who represented
the University in the meet held, as in past years, at
Elmira, N. Y., were Floyd Sweet, '36E, Nelson Shap-
ter, '36E, Henry Wightman, '36, Nicholas Sestock,
'37E, and Constantin Lhevinne, '00E.
Sweet, flying the club's Franklin Utility glider, placed
first in two of the three events in the utility glider class.
In the altitude contest he soared to the height of 3.517
feet, and in the distance contest, flew the glider for
24.25 miles. In the sweepstake contest, Sweet placed
second, winning for himself the position of number
two ranking glider pilot of the United States.
The University Glider Club plans to purchase a pri-
mary glider for student use alone. This will allow
their Franklin Utility glider to be saved for future
contests.
Form Aeronautical Division of A.S.M.E.
At a meeting of the Aeronautical Engineers held
Tuesday evening. October 2, in the East Engineering
Building, it was decided to form an Aeronautical Divi-
sion of the A.S.M.E. to be separate and distinct from
the Student Branch of the A.S.M.E. now in existence.
The purpose of the Aeronautical Division is to pre-
sent a series of talks, both by the faculty and by com-
petent engineers in the field of aeronautics, take inspec-
tion trips to neighboring airports and aircraft factories,
and to foster a general program of social gatherings
that would be inspirational to Aeronautical Engineering
students. While maintaining the independence of a
separate organization, all possible cooperation with the
A.S.M.E. now organized—in the way of joint meetings
and mutual aid—will be the goal.
A committee of six will meet in the near future to
develop the organization plans and a general meeting
will be held shortly for the purpose of electing officers
and preceding with a definite program. Approximately
eighty men attended the initial meeting and gave evi-
dence of an enthusiastic support.
o
Recent Changes in Engineering Curriculum
The University of Michigan Official Publication for
the College of Engineering for this year has changed
the name Shop Courses to Metal Processing. Under
Prof. Boston's supervision the shop department has
grown not only on the technical side but even more so
on the theoretical, so that the name Metal Processing
is more fitting to the department as a whole.
Another combined curriculum has been added to the
College of Enginering, a five-year course in Engineer-
ing-Forestry. The purpose of this course is to meet
the need of students in forestry who desire a broader
engineering foundation for work in wood technology.
The student enrolls in the College of Engineering for

use of welded piping made it pos-
sible to mount an additional 8-in.
gun and still conform to treaty
weight limits.
These many cases drawn from
actual experience show the advan-
tages of building products from
light weight metals and alloys by
welding. Welded joints are most
efficient and economical for mod-
ern metals and designs.

If Your Product Must Weigh Less
Oxy-Acetylene welding will eliminate heavy joints and give
throughout—greater sturdiness with less weight and bulk.
By F. J. King*
The trend in modern product
design has been toward lightening
weight. Manufacturers wishing to
make their metal products lighter
are building them of light weight
alloys and metals with welded
joints. Products so fabricated util-
ize the superior features of welded
joints to attain lightness with
strength, ruggedness, and attrac-
tive appearance.
Welding Is Strong
Lightness is gained in welding
because each joint is a smooth
union of two metal parts into one.
No lapping or flanging is needed
for making the joint. Corners are
not bulky or cumbersome. Invis-
ible seams give a smooth surface
for painting and enameling. And
in strength the joint is 100 per cent
efficient—as strong as the metal it
joins.
BAFFLING CORROSION-resis-
tance to the action of salt water
can be effected with special alloy
metals. Welding is used to give
light weight joint* in all commer-
cial metals and alloys.
In Modern Automobiles
In automobiles, for instance,
lightness has been attained by de-
signing many motor and body parts
for welding. The resulting light
weight car has less tire wear, less
gas consumption, fewer repairs.
Its welded seams have smooth con-
tours and streamlines, offering less
wind resistance and providing an
even surface for fine finishes.
On the Airways
Safe, speedy flying was next to
impossible until the aircraft indus-
try adopted rhe welded joint for
airplane fuselage construction.
With other means of joining it
would hardly be possible to carry
a profitable pay-load. Welded light
alloy fuel tanks for aircraft are
safer, lighter, srronger and more
compact.
In the chemical and food indus-
tries, also, welding contributes to
lighter weight. Light alloy piping
andcontainerscanbe used—welded
to give a smooth, even surface in-
side and out. Welding leaves no
rough spots for corrosion or germs
to attack.
Saves Tons of Weight
A prominent example of weight
saving is in the use of welded pip-
ing on the new treaty cruisers.
For The Future
Industrial executives interested
in making their products lighter
can obtain further data on the use
of welding in their own operations
through The Linde Air Products
Company. This company, in addi-
tion to utilizing the facilities of
Union Carbide and Carbon Re-
search Laboratories, Inc., has had
wide experience drawn from over
20 years in pioneering and devel-
oping oxy-acetylene applications.
Advice and assistance to manufac-
turers on how best to use oxweld-
ing and cutting for their needs is
available without charge through
sales offices of The Linde Air Pro-
ducts Company located in Atlanta,
Baltimore, Birmingham, Boston,

SUCCESS STORY
A. C. Transient was an engineer, class of '28. He
had been born ambitious, and it was this ambition that
was to set him apart from other engineers, to insure
the success that was to come. He realized that mechan-
ics and math were just so many things to learn that
had already been gone over before, and besides being
dull, took a lot of valuable time. So instead of wast-
ing his energy on these, he did the thing that was to
account for his success. He read Astonishing Stories,
and from these, with his fertile imagination, conceived
plans for an undertaking that would take him out of
the humdrum of everyday engineering, something in
which he would really be doing things. He would
build a space ship.
Immediately upon flunking out of school, he started
his great work. He located an old barn in the country,
and here worked day and night perfecting his master-
piece. He carefully polished the great double steel in-
sulated shell of his ship to reduce atmospheric friction
to a minimum. He carefully installed rocket propul-
sion and control tubes. He provided elaborate heating
and air conditioning equipment to assure comfort in the
cold vacuum of outer space.
Finally the great day came, the ship was completed.
He wheeled it outside, the great hull shining in the sun-
light. His work was finished. His success was in-
sured, and he would be provided for for life. Now for
the reward. He wheeled the mighty space ship over to
the side of the highway, set up a hot-dog stand inside
tvf it, and has done a thriving business ever since on
the curious motorists.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


On October 3. 1934 Michigan Technic sponsored
a talk on the above subject by Samuel S. Myer. Con-
sulting Engineer of Columbus, Ohio. Mr. \Yyer re-
iterated that today's depression is not an ordinary de-
pression—it is the forerunner of a new epoch in social
evolution. The way this epoch will be brought about
quickly is by a sound philosophy of living.
The steps in solving today's acute economic sutler
ing arc to:
1. Develop a fact-facing attitude of mind, and base
economic studies on life's realities, and
2. Recognize that Science has not increased Man's
wisdom nor altered His passions, but has only given
Man more power, and
3. Develop creative-law-minded leaders who will
realixe that law must be geared to social change, and
4. Develop a reverent and understanding attitude
toward God and the universe, and an appreciation that
spiritual values underlie all things.
The way out of today's economic muddle will be an
orderly society in which private ownership is estab-
lished and maintained for human welfare purposes.
The basis will be proven experience, creative attitude
and constitutional code for capital, management, labor
and public, recognizing that where law ends tyranny
begins. The goal will be economic security and com-
fort for the masses rather than economic power and
luxurv for a favored few.

Professor Chipman Awarded Medal
One of the most recent honors to he bestowed upon
our illustrious engineering faculty is the awarding of the
Howe Medal of the American Society of Metals to Assist-
ant Professor John Chipman, author of the article "Oxy-
gen and Nitrogen Affect Properties of Steel" in this issue.
This award was announced recently for Professor Chip-
man's paper on "Application of Thermodynamics to The
Oxidation of Liquid Steel." The medal is awarded each
year to the author of the most outstanding paper pre-
sented to the society.
The paper was an outgrowth of an investigation sup-
ported by the Timken Steel and Tube Company, the
greater part of which was conducted by Mr. Chipman.
As a direct result of his work, new field in metallurgical
engineering is opened with specific reference to chemical
thermodynamics and clarifies some of the problems en-
countered during the liquification process in refining
steel.
Professor Chipman has acted in the capacity of re-
search engineer at Michigan since coming here in 1929.
Previously he had been connected with the chemistry
department of the Georgia School Technology after re-
ceiving his B.S. in chemistry from the southern univer-
sity, his Master of Science from the University of Iowa
in 1922, and his Ph.D. from the University of California
in 1926.

STONE-THROWING ROMEOS
The engineers of the General Electric Company
have been asked to solve some unusual problems,
but never before have they had to work against
Cupid. This is how it came about: Some of the swains
who did their courting in parked cars along certain
lighted roads in New England found that the lamps
crimped their style. With simple but destructive
logic they decided to extinguish the lamps with
stones. Their aim was so good that repairmen of the
utility which serviced the lights could hardly keep
up with their depredations. Finally, G-E illuminat-
ing engineers were called in to design a fixture to
foil the stone-throwing Romeos. These engineers
produced a cast-aluminum guard, which looks very
much like a baseball catcher's mask. It protects the
lamp, and at the same time helps to concentrate
light on the roadway.
HURRY!HURRY!
A flood had crippled three important electric
motors in the refinery of a large oil company on the
island of Aruba, 50 miles north of the coast of
Venezuela. The plant had to be shut down until new
coils could be installed. Losses caused by the shut-
down ran into thousands of dollars a day. An order
for the coils and word of the refinery's predicament
reached General Electric in Schenectady, N. Y.,
on a Sunday morning. Work began immediately, and
by dint of night shifts and a great concentra-
tion of efforts, the two-and-one-half-week job was
completed in three days. The 808-pound shipment
of coils, conveniently packed in small cartons, was
flown in a chartered plane from Schenectady to the
Newark airport, where it was transferred to an
Eastern Air Lines plane bound for Miami. On
Wednesday morning the cartons were transferred
to a Pan-American Airways ship at Miami for tin-
hop across the Caribbean to Kingston, Jamaica.
From there, they were flown directly to Aruba in
a specially chartered plane. They arrived Saturday
morning, just six days after the order had been
received by General Electric.
J. A.H.Torry, Union College, '11. and G. II. Magner,
Acadia College, Nova Scotia. '09, of the Inter-
national General Electric Company, Inc., made
the arrangements for filling the order.
FAT SPARKS
The artificial lightning boys have beaten natural
lightning in one regard, at any rate. Engineers in
the General Electric high-voltage laboratory ha&gt;e
produced discharges of a quarter of a million am-
peres, which is greater than the current of any direct
lightning stroke jet recorded. This current is dis-
charged at a pressure of loO.OOO volts.
Just as natural lightning, with amperage almost as
great, destroys that which it strikes, so does the
laboratory discharge; ami just as natural lightning is
accompanied by thunder, the laboratory bolls have
their ear-splitting crashes. A copper wire a tenth of
an inch in diameter is completely vaporized. A
similar piece of iron wire is "exploded," the remain-
ing ends continuing white hot for several seconds.
A section of reinforced concrete is broken into bits.
The handle of a silver-plated ice cream spoon van-
ishes with a shower of sparks, leaving behind only
the bowl discolored by the heal.
These engineers were lhe first to produce 10,000,000-
volt artificial lightning discharges, and they are con-
tinuing their studies through these high-current
discharges, in order to find better means of protect-
ing electric distribution systems. K. B. McEaehron,
Ohio Northern, '13, Purdue, '20. M.S.. is director
of the laboratory, and associated with him in these
tests are: W. L. Lloyd, Hennselaer Polytechnic In-
stitute, '18; J. L. Thomason, U. of Idaho. '29: G. D.

USE DOW METAL
INDUSTRY'S LIGHTEST
STRUCTURAL METAL
WHEN race officials put top weight on a horse,they
call it a handicap. Likewise, when manufacturers
put top weight on a portable mechanism or tool, it is a
handicap, no matter what you may cell it.
Dowmetal's greatest value lies in its property of reduc-
ing weight without sacrificing strength. The Automatic
Musical Instrument Company uses Dowmetal castings in
their sound motion picture projector, a machine of pro-
fessional quality, yet weighing but 75 Ibs. with its
carrying case. It is thus not only portable, but is
easily handled.
The Syntron Company uses Dowmetal in heavy duty tie
tampers, subjected to the heavy stresses of a percussive
blow. Lightness with strength is necessary.
The Buckeye Portable Tool Company relieves the operator
of unnecessary strain in handling their Hercules high-
frequency polishing machine. The lightness gives the
operator control of the machine where excess pressure
would burn through the finish.
Although anything that can be carried by a workman
might be considered portable, most portable tools have
to be moved, carried, and used for hours at a time.
Saving of weight on a portable device frees manpower
for utility and reduces workman fatigue.
The Dowmetal Data Book will give you facts of weights
and strengths that will make your products lighter and
better. Get your copy today.

His Community
BENNETT WEAVER
Professor of English
Referring to an engine; which he had huilt at Chace-
water. James Watt wrote to his friend Boulton: "The
velocity, violence, magnitude, and horrible noise of the
engine give universal satisfaction to all beholders."
What he said of the folk in the little village of Corn-
wall we may now fairly say of the people of the whole
world. We are all delighted with the noise and the
speed and the jxnver of engines. The machine is our
obvious god. Energy and wheels, energy and propellers
and wings—in these are our thrill and our faith. For
energy we blast open the solar system, we bombard the
atom. Animal power will no longer do; man power
will no longer do; steam power is insufficient. We
pump up power from the mile-deep pockets of the
ancient earth. From the strata-sealed juices of plants
that were succulent before man walked the world we
boil out power for our engines. We rip the air from
Los Angeles to New York. We give her the gun and
laugh at Jove who took six days for his flashing trip
from Olympus to Ethiopia; for how mean are the ways
of an Olympian god to those of an American bent on
speed. Power and propellers and speed. We know
what we want power for: We want it for speed. What
we w:ant speed for we have no time to know. We swoop
down out of the stratosphere and land. What shall we
do now? There is nothing but to swoop up again and
beat the record. Swooping and beating records—
that's it!
But the energy that hurls a plane across America in
half a day might lift a vast city of Empire State build-
ings a foot off the earth. What sense there might be
in lifting a city of Empire State buildings a foot off
the earth we do not ask. Energy, energy that has ex-
plosive power, that is it. It may blow things up and
to pieces as well as move things at fascinating speeds
from here to there. The atom : we yearn over it think-
ing that if we can but break open its ultimate cell we
shall have power enough to run we know not what, to
blow up we know not what. Until we have in our hands
the raw force sufficient to destroy the world we shall
never feel that we have mastered the world.
Engineer Should Understand Use of Power
This is largely the engineer's world, and it is time
he was making u[&gt; his mind to lake better care of it.
In our schools of Engineering every course leading to
expertness in the physical use of power should be sup-
plemented by a course leading to a sure understanding
of how that power may be used for the good of men.
Power must be socialized. It is becoming clear to us
that an alien selling a German machine gun to a New
York gangster is committing an unfriendly act. It is
not so clear that an engineer who puts his technically
perfected machine into the hands of one who will not
use it for right social ends is underestimating his re-
sponsibility. No one can turn perfected force loose
into living masses of people and be free from respon-
sibility for the consequences. This now sounds like a
far cry. It will not sound so far in the future; and
we never know how far or how near the future is from
us. One grows impatient with the stupidity which trys
to demolish good sense and true sense by calling it
"impractical idealism." The world is constantly being
lugged back and down and sideways by the so-called
practical men. If we but think we shall know that the
really practical man is he who sees the end in the
means; who has imagination enough to sense the rela-

because he directs wisely now the forces which must
work to make up that future. I repeat: the world is
largely the engineer's world, and it is time he was
making up his mind to take better care of it.
Let me illustrate what I mean by an absorbing inter-
est in machinery without a scrupulous interest in the
end for which machinery should operate. A certain
manufacturer built a plant of the finest kind. In build-
ings of perfect construction he housed engines of per-
fect design. His life went into his machines and into
his pride of them. His greatest delight was in escort-
ing his friends through the plant. At the end of the
grand tour one day a friend said: "I have never seen
finer buildings. I have never seen such powerful en-
gines nor seen any that ran more smoothly. I can
understand your pride. But—I forgot to ask—what
is it you manufacture with these engines?" His host
looked upon his friend dumbfounded. Then he an-
swered with that deep agitation in his voice which char-
acterizes one who speaks of the ultimate: "What do I
manufacture? Sir, I manufacture oil to use on my
engines!" And this is the parable of the practical man.
Community Embraces the World
You ask me to speak of the engineer in his commun-
ity. The world is his community. One cannot think
of him in a smaller environment. True, the man him-
self may stay in Detroit or in Flint all his life; but the
products of his mind, the materials shaped for move-
ment and power by his genius go everywhere. Douglas
Fairbanks once noticed a little African nomad scuffing
through the desert sands with his feet oddly pointed
out. Upon asking he found that the little chap was
imitating Charlie Chaplin. The corpus of the comedian
may have been in Hollywood; his influence was moving
sand on an African desert. But it is no mere matter
of influence which we have in mind when we analyze
the situation of the engineer. His mind may work
through machines of physical force ten thousand miles
from where he himself is, and it may keep on working
after he! is dead. The engineer is inexorably bound to
the cars and the guns, the machines and the things
which he designs and makes. American engineering
genius is working in the machines of Russia, is feeding
into the engines of imperial Japan. German engineer-
ing genius is pouring itself out of test tubes in Amer-
ican chemical laboratories. No night falls upon the
corners of the earth but it is pierced by the genius of
Edison; there is no silence upon the earth because of
the vibrant intelligence of Marconi. None of us can
escape the engineer. He is the near neighbor of all of
us. The question is this : IVill he be a wise and a good
neighbor?
A Problem of Ethics
It is said that the master magician Houdini upon
facing death would not reveal the secrets of much that
he could do because he feared that the knowledge would
fall into the hands of men dangerous to society. The
engineer, also, whose community is the world, is a
master magician. Will he match the ethics of the
stage showman? As a neighbor, we can ask little less
of him. Will he give bombs to angry and undeveloped
children to toss about in our streets and blow our houses
to pieces; or will he keep upon his laboratory a secret
lock which no angry child may pick, not even though
he be a king of the Balkans? I repeat: Every course
leading to expertness in the physical use of power
should be supplemented by a course leading to a sure
understanding of how that power may be used for the
good of men.
But, you ask, what of the private life of the human
being who, engineer or no, lives in this Detroit or this
Flint? Well, there is nothing for it at last but he must
be intelligent. His life is like the life of other men:
the more things to which he may respond highly; the
more things among which he can see the relationships;
the more often he can tell the good from the bad and
the better from the merely good; the more he sharp-
ens his taste for the excellent and the more he employs
his energies in making the excellent prevail, the more
he will be alive. Being alive after all is a matter of
harmonizing emotion and intelligence, and of having
something to harmonize. Plain healthy sanity is not a
small item in individual happiness and in social good.
And sanity was never made out of vapidity.
Interests are the great enemies of the vapid life.
It is they which destroy the staleness of professional
existence; and in general the higher the level on which
they work the more effective they are in taking the
unprofitableness out of living. It goes without saying
that nothing can take the place of the zest with which
a man does his professional task. For the engineer
nothing should be so absorbing and vitalizing as "the
job." True, and true enough. But the point is that
"the job" will be more interesting and the professional
life will take on more significance if the man inside the
engineer has his extra-interests. Among men of the
profession who have succeeded it is impressive to find
a width of cultural interests. Being men naturally im-
aginative their response to music and to literature is
often of a rare order and their sensitiveness to design
in art and in architecture marks them. I speak not of
the mine-run engineer, but of the type of professional
engineer which every graduate of our University should
aspire to be.
Should Develop Cultered Side of Mind
Says Newman: "A cultivated intellect, because it is
a good in itself, brings with it a power and a grace to
every work and occupation which it undertakes, and
enables us to be more useful." To see clearly and
with conviction that every element of power which is
brought into the mind through response to cultural
things is useable as power in a professional way is to

being an engineer of quality. The mind once added
to has more power for all its tasks. Would you per-
fect that motor? First, then, perfect your hearing of
this symphony of Beethoven. Would you design an
Ambassador Bridge? First delight your mind in the
structure of the first act of Othello. I say these things
to illustrate -what I mean; and what I mean spells the
difference between just one more engineer and the man
who is eager and who has the stamina, the will, and the
imagination to enter upon his professional heritage.
The
Frontispiece
Looking at the open pit shown in the frontispiece, it
is difficult to visualize the bright, shiny, light metal
which will be produced from that raw material. It is
a far step from the earthy looking material being
loaded into cars to the aluminum of commerce, which
is finding applications in every field of human activity.
Bauxite, a mixture of alumic and ferric hydrates con-
taining widely varying amounts of alumina, ferric
oxide, silica, calcium and magnesium carbonates, water.
etc. contains from 40 to 55 per cent alumina (A12O3).
It is generally mined in open pits, as shown, although
there are some localities in which underground mining
is necessary on account of the great depth of over-
burden or the character and attitude of the bauxite de-
posits. The principal bauxite-producing districts in the
order of their production, are: Var, Southern France:
Arkansas, U.S.; Dutch Guiana; Western Hungary;
British Guiana; Istrian Peninsula, Italy; Dalmatia,
Jugoslavia; Herault, Southern France; and the Geor-
gia-Alabama-Tennessee Field in the U.S.
The ore cannot be used directly in the electrolytic re-
duction process, since it contains the oxides of several
other metals as impurities. It must first be purified by
a chemical process. The Bayer Process is most com-
monly employed. In this process the aluminum oxide
is dissolved out of the ore by means of sodium hydrox-
ide, reprecipitated as aluminum hydrate and calcined
(dehydrated) to form pure aluminum oxide.
Process Discovered in America
The commercial process for producing aluminum
from alumina was discovered in America by Charles
Martin Hall, a graduate of Oberlin College. As an
undergraduate, a chance remark by Professor Jewett.
"The man who discovers a process by which aluminum
could be made on a commercial scale not only would be
a benefactor to the world but would be able to lay up
for himself a great fortune," gave him the incentive.
Hall poked a fellow classmate in the ribs with the re-
mark. "I'm going after that metal," and on February
23, 1886, less than a year after his graduation, he dis-
covered the process. Heroult, a Frenchman and inci-
dentally only a year older than Hall, discovered the
same process two months later. Since Hall and Her-
oult worked independently, the present day electrolytic
process for the production of aluminum is commonly
called the Hall-Heroult Process. Briefly described, it
consists of dissolving aluminum in molten cryolite (a
double fluoride of sodium and aluminum) in a carbon
lined pot and passing an electric current through the
mixture.
The importance of the discovery may be realized
when its effect upon the aluminum industry is seen.
True, aluminum had made its commercial bow at Gla-
ciere, a suburb of Paris, more than thirty years earlier,
but it was too costly to make its general use feasible.
The King of Siam could afford a watch charm of alumi-
num and Napoleon' III could entertain his regal guests
on aluminum plates which would have made our famous
gold plates seem more like kitchen utensils. The first
successful commercial process, purely chemical, was
the reduction of aluminum chloride with metallic
sodium. Since both sodium and aluminum chloride
were expensive, aluminum could not hope to vie with
iron, copper, lead. zinc, tin and nickel, everyday metals
of commerce.
At the time the Hall-Heroult Process was discovered,
aluminum sold for approximately $8 to $12 a pound.
In five years' time, the price had dropped to less than
a dollar. Today, the base price is in the neighborhood
of 25 cents per pound.
Glider Club Activities
The U. of M. Glider Club found itself in the front
ranks of the recent Piccard Stratosphere flight. Twelve
club members were chosen to serve on the balloon
ground crew, and found that pulling a rope on the big
gas bag was almost as much fun as a glider flight. Most
of them were assigned to the outer circle stations and
given the job of letting out or pulling in rope to raise
or lower the balloon according to instructions from
K. W. Hill, flight director.
The club has been operating very successfully this
semester since the purchase of new equipment, which
consists of two Waco primary gliders. The primaries
are being used for beginning training and the Franklin
utility glider for advanced flying.
A special type of landing gear has been built on one
of the primaries, incorporating a number of unusual
features. The gear is so arranged that the ship is
allowed to swing both laterally and fore-and-aft with
the wheels remaining on the ground. In this way the
student may be trained in three dimension control be-
fore even leaving the ground.

to Qualitative and
Quantitative Analysis
R. W. SMITH
Research Associate
Dept. of Engineering Research
Every engineer who keeps himself well informed
concerning the rapid advances being made in his own
and related fields must he struck by the continual use
made of scientific principles, phenomena or techniques
which, though long known, have heretofore been of
little or no practical use. Some of our most recent de-
velopments in engineering are based on concepts or even
working models long familiar to many but regarded as
of academic interest only until the intelligent and thor-
ough methods of modern engineering research shaped
them into tools of immense practical value. One of
the latest results of this application of the scientific
method to industrial problems is the use of the spectro-
scope and spectrograph as an invaluable aid in the
metallurgical and allied fields. The principle of the
spectroscope was discovered long ago by Newton who
noticed that a prism of glass had the power to disperse
the light of the sun into a spectrum of its component
colors. Later it was found that, while very hot bodies
such as the sun or glowing pieces of metal gave con-
tinuous spectra wherein one color gradually shaded into
another, other sources of light such as electric sparks
and arcs gave spectra of bright, discreet lines, these
lines being characteristic of the material of the elec-
trodes between which the electrical discharge occurred.
Every chemical element gives a unique line spectrum
of its own so that the presence of an element in an
alloy electrode could be inferred by the presence of its
line spectrum in the spectrum of the alloy. Also the
number of spectrum lines visible and their brilliancy
depended on the amount of the element present in the
electrode. These spectral lines could either be observed
visually in a telescope as in the spectroscope or could be
recorded on a photographic plate as in the spectrograph.
A reproduction of a typical plate is shown in Figure
1. This represents part of the spectrum emitted when
an arc is maintained between electrodes of a nickel
alloy containing barium. The blackness of the barium
line as compared to that of the nickel line may be uti-
lized to measure the amount of barium present. The
l»tterns seen to the right of the spectrum are calibra-
tion marks put on the plate to enable a precise deter-
mination of the relative intensities of any pair of lines
such as those marked.
Facts Long Known
All these facts have been known and used for many
years by physicists in their researches in atomic struc-
ture and allied subjects. The spectrograph has been
largely instrumental in establishing our present knowl-
edge of atomic structure and the origin of spectra. Yet
only in the past few years has there been any syste-
matic attempt to utilize this facile tool to further indus-
trial progress. The progress has been rapid, however,
so that in the last ten years the spectrograph has de-
veloped from the toy of pure scientists to a powerful
industrial tool supplementing or even supplanting quali-
tative and quantitative analysis by chemical methods.
The most obvious application of the spectroscope
was, of course, to qualitative analysis. If an arc or
spark is maintained between metallic electrodes the
spectrum recorded by the spectrograph will contain
lines characteristic of each element present in the metal.
The spectra of the elements are all well known and
classified so that a trained worker can readily identify
the various lines. In the case of elements whose spectra
are complex, the number of lines may at first seem
confusing, but a comparison spectrum will at once indi-
cate the lines due to any selected metal. The time
taken in the actual detection of an impurity is only a
matter of minutes, and with practice the observer will
recognize at a glance the distinctive groups of the prin-
cipal lines of various elements.
Eliminates Necessity of Separating Constituents
In a qualitative analysis the necessity for separating
the metallic constituents into the usual chemical groups,
and the need for special tests where certain metals
occur together, are avoided by the use of the spectro-
graph. The chemical detection of small quantities of
nickel, vanadium or molybdenum in a steel, or zinc and
lead in approximately pure copper, is a long and tedious
process, requiring close attention to details of chemical
and physical conditions affecting the process of separa-
tion, any deviation from which may lead to error. Such
problems are involved in no uncertainty in spectro-
graphic analysis. The whole substance is disintegrated
into its elements in the arc or spark and each element
is acted upon so as to emit its characteristic spectral
lines.

quantity of the substance. Ten milligrams is usually
ample, but complete analysis can be made with a frac-
tion of a milligram. This is a great advantage in spe-
cial operations such as the determination of base metals
in bullion or platinum where cost is important.
Finds Unlooked-For Elements
Nothing rivals the spectrograph for detecting, with-
out the necessity of separation, minute quantities of
certain metals present in any element, compound or
mixture. Another advantage is that it does not discrim-
inate between that which is looked for and that which is
wholly out of mind. For example, few would suspect
the presence of chromium in water, yet it is an occa-
sional constituent of natural water. Its proportion is
always minute and it would never be found by chemical
means unless laboriously sought in a large quantity of
material. Using only a few milligrams of the total
solids left on evaporation and examining the residue by
means of the spectrograph, its presence is recorded
without special effort and without anticipation.
The simplicity of procedure and certainty of the con-
clusions of spectroscopy when applied to innumerable
qualitative problems, immediately called attention to the
possibility of using the same technique for quantitative
estimations. This important extension in the scope of
spectroscopic work was slow in early development, but
has been rapidly assuming importance during the past
few years with the result that the Department of Engi-
neering Research in collaboration with the A. C. Spark-
plug Company has succeeded in developing a successful
and practical method of quantitative analysis with the
spectroscope.
Blackness of Lines Shows Quantity
The first need in these further applications is a spec-
troscopic quantity which varies when the proportion
of an element present in a given specimen is varied ; the
second is to devise an accurate means of measuring the
variation. The first condition is easily fulfilled. Several
such quantities may be
found but the most satis-
factory one has been the in-
tensity of the spectral lines
of the element as meas-
ured by the blackness of
the lines recorded on the
photographic plates. The
important problem has been
to satisfy the second condi-
tion—the provision of a
method of measuring with
accuracy variations of these
line intensities.
In making use of spectral
lines in quantitative analy-
sis, it is the intensity of the light in a given spectral line
with which one is concerned, not the photographed
image. The intensity of the light in a source may be
expected to depend upon the amount of the element in
the source that is giving forth that light. However,
it is convenient only to work with the photographed
spectrum and the relative intensities of various lines
must be determined from it. Accurate quantitative
analysis demands the use of the best available technique
of modern spectral photometry and a full understand-
ing of the photographic processes. By making use of
methods recently introduced for measuring the inten-
sities of spectral lines, and by a simple means of stand-
ardizing the light source used in the analysis a rapid
and precise method of spectrographic analysis has been
developed. This has been used for a number of years
for estimating small amounts of metals in various
alloys, particularly nickel alloys, in connection with the
development of the A. C. Spark Plug Company of
nickel alloys containing barium. Since early in 1931
this method has been used continuously for the quan-
titative determination of barium in nickel alloys. During
this time numerous checks by means of chemical analy-
ses have shown that the spectroscopic determinations
are fully as consistent and accurate as those made by
chemical methods. This long-continued use of a method
of accurate quantitative analysis for a particular pur-
pose clearly demonstrates its reliability and value. The
method has been used with similar success in deter-
mining silicon in steel, chromium and aluminum in
nickel, magnesium in zinc, and magnesium, sodium and
potassium in various solutions, and seems capable of
very general application. Quantitative spectrographic
measurements are now a matter of routine in a number
of industrial laboratories, and indeed form the sole
check which is applied in the control of many opera-
tions. Spectrographic methods have proved themselves
from the first to be peculiarly suited to a type of deter-
mination which is both tedious and uncertain when ap-
proached by direct chemical operations—the determi-
nation of constituents present in small quantity. This

of major constituents are outside its powers.
A Useful Aid in Many Problems
In conclusion it may be instructive to enumerate
some of the wide range of problems in chemical analy-
sis which can be successfully attacked by the spectro-
graph.
1. Rapid qualitative or quantitative analysis of the
whole of the metallic constituents of a substance.
2. Approximate analyses by sight (after a certain
amount, of experience has been obtained).
3. Examination of precipitates (after weighing) for
freedom from constituents which .should have been
separated.
4. The detection of traces of metallic impurities or
constituents in:
(a) Inorganic precipitates, residues and powders.
(b) Organic substances, e.g., foodstuffs, textiles, etc.
(c) Vitreous substances, e.g., glasses and slags.
(d) Refractories, clays, etc.
5. Testing the purity of analytical reagents.
6. Detection of rare, unexpected or trace metals in
minerals.
7. Analysis of substances of which only very small
quantities are available.
8. Check control of metallurgical factory output.
9. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of metallic
constituents in solutions.
Hydraulic Transmissions
for the Automobile
LESTER V. COLWELL, '35E
The significant trends in the automotive industry
today are toward higher speeds, greater comfort, and
greater ease of operation. This makes it necessary that
control be made easier and more, fully automatic. In
recent developments the brakes and clutches have been
made partially automatic by several different methods.
Significant among these trends are the developments
of the hydraulic clutch in several European-made au-
tomobiles.
Since most of the hydraulic clutches that have been
built are quite complex and difficult to understand, a
brief general description of the working parts will suf-
fice. A comparison of the performance characteristics
with those of the conventional mechanical transmission
almost universally used today is more interesting.
The hydraulic transmission is based on the turbine
principle. The major parts consist of a pump wheel
and a turbine wheel mounted to rotate in a common
working chamber in a stationary casing in which the
hydraulic or working fluid is circulated in a closed path
of flow. The turbine wheel is usually provided with
three rings or stages of blading working in conjunction
with two rings of stationary guide blades carried by
the casing.
A simple description of the essential operating fea-
tures of the converter will clarify its construction and
utility. The impeller blades which serve to give the
fluid its initial velocity, in an outward direction, are
mounted onto a disc which in turn is rigidly attached
to the crank shaft of the engine. As the fluid leaves
these blades, it is deflected by stationary vanes towards
a second bladed disc which converts the energy of the
fluid into rotational motion of the drive shaft, running
to the differential. The stationary vanes mentioned
above are mounted on the inner periphery of the trans-
mission housing. After leaving this last disc, the fluid
returns to the impeller blades, thus completing its cir-
cuit of flow.
The working chamber in which the fluid circulates is
maintained completely filled with fluid at all times dur-
ing use. Various fluids may be used as the working
fluid for the transmission, but, up to the present, the
fluid usually employed has been kerosene to which has
been added a small precentage of lubricating oil.
Maximum torque multiplication for this type of
transmission is approximately 5:1. At idling engine
speeds the torque transmitted to the drive shaft is too
small to overcome the inertia of the automobile; a
clutch is therefore not required. This is the first ob-
jection to the hydraulic transmission, since the slippage
is 100 per cent at engine speeds of from 300 r.p.m. to
500 r.p.m., depending upon the construction, so that
driving at the slower speeds is impossible without direct
drive. However, as with free-wheeling, direct-drive is
made optional by the use of a selective lever operated
by the driver. Direct drive is also not only desirable
but necessary for power braking in mountainous re-
gions. Since the turbine wheel will over-run like a free-
wheeling device, this later unit need not be incor-
porated.

is the fact that a mechanical spur gear reversing unit
must be added, thus further complicating the transmis-
sion. Not as much additional space is needed as it
might seem at first thought, for the reversing device is
placed in the same compartment with the synchronizing
clutches and gears for the direct drive mechanism.
The third objection to the hydraulic transmission as
compared to the conventional mechanical transmission
is its very complex construction. This objection is
more pertinent in the United States than in Europe as
far as the automotive industry is concerned. European
automobile manufacturers do more custom-building
and, as we all know, vary design considerably, whereas
American manufacturers must give more consideration
to production costs. Consequently no manufacturer
will pioneer a unit without very definite proof of its
success, and there is no doubt but that the hydraulic
transmission is still very much in the experimental
stages of development.
It has an advantage over the mechanical transmis-
sion in that the latter has a friction-disc clutch whose
plates must be replaced after a certain amount of wear
has taken place, while the hydraulic transmission has
very little wear except for erosion of the turbine blades;
even that has been rendered negligible through use of a
blunt end design and also with movable blades so that
nothing need be replaced except in case of accidental
breakage. The movable or adjustable blades also widen
the range of operation of the transmission, provide
variable torque multiplication, and when closed stop
circulation of the working fluid thus providing a neu-
tral position without using a separate clutch. The
variable torque feature along with the hydraulic prin-
ciple produces accelerations as much as 20 per cent
greater than the mechanical transmission by virtue of
its more efficient utilization of the available torque and
power. Up to the present time, there have been no
installations in automobiles that have utilized all the
automatic features that can be incorporated in such a
transmission but it is expected that future installations
will have them.
It is no secret that the foremost automobile manu-
facturers in the United States have been experimenting
with hydraulic transmissions for a couple of years in
their laboratories but they are not ready for production
as yet.
The principal difficulty encountered has been that all
the different types tested are too complex and difficult
to put into production. Also it must be remembered
that there are several types of semi-automatic mechan-
ical clutches and transmissions in use today that are
quite successful and until a simply constructed hy-
draulic transmission is able to satisfy and fulfill all the
demands of the high speeds and high accelerating
torques common today it is likely to remain out of the
picture. However, we remember how suddenly indi-
vidual wheel suspension made its debut in this country
and in view of the fact that hydraulic transmissions arc-
in use in Europe and in our own automotive labora-
tories we should not be at all surprised if they make
a successful appearance in the market in the next few
years.
Technical
Brief;
Coal Tar From a Percolator
Pennsylvania State College has developed a new type
of percolator, but it isn't the kind with which we are
all familiar. No delicious cups of steaming coffee will
ever be poured from this percolator; the inky black
liquid that results is coal tar. Ground coal is placed
into a perforated holder and instead of water, some
tetralin, a water-white liquid, is poured into the per-
colator. The air is then pumped out and hydrogen gas
is introduced. The pressure is raised to 3.200 pounds
and the tetralin is then boiled so that it rises and runs
down through the coal. The percolator brings down 90
percent of the coal, making it an inky black liquid.
This hydrogenation process was developed by C. C.
Wright, a national research fellow in the department
of fuel technology. The purpose of the percolator is
the liquifaction of the greatest possible part of the coal
with the least destruction of its chemical makeup. The
separation of the different substances in coal becomes
easier when' the coal is liquified. The tar produced in
this way retains 90 i&gt;er cent of the original content of
the coal. Tar produced by ordinary heating contains
less than 10 percent. This process is a great aid to the
study of coal tar and the many dyes, perfumes, medi-
cines, and other products of coal.

Country's Highest Aerial Tower
Radio Towers Reach Skyward
Radio station KOA at Denver now boasts the high-
est radio aerial in the United States. The new 470
foot self supporting tower is a departure from the com-
mon type of antenna which consists of copper wires
strung in clothesline fashion between two towers. The
single tower will act as a vertical radiator of waves and
will be much more efficient than the clothesline antenna
from which a large part of the energy flows directly
upward and is lost in space. Engineers expect a greater
signal strength at a given distance because a larger
portion of the broadcast waves will be radiated parallel
to the earth's surface.
The tower is only 36 feet square at the base and
tapers to a two-foot square at the top. It weighs 50
tons and the weight is supported equally on four huge
porcelain eggs which insulate it from the ground. It
will withstand a wind of 125 miles an hour.

Lt.-Commander Rosendahl Sticks by Dirigible
The confidence of at least one man has not been
shaken in military and civil usefulness of the dirigible
despite the ill-fortune that has pursued that type of
craft. Lieutenant-Commander C. E. Rosendahl.
speaking before the President's aviation commission
recently, urged that the United States build immedi-
ately four dirigibles, two for military service and two
for transoceanic service by private companies. Evi-
dently Lieutenant-Commander Rosendahl is not pleased
to see other countries taking the lead in the develop-
ment of lighter-than-air craft while Uncle Sam sits
quietly by. The Graf Zeppelin has been maintaining a
regular mail schedule between the North African coast
and Pernambuco, Brazil, and there is a possibility that
the huge Zeppelin LZ129 now under construction at
Friedrichshafen. Germany, may soon carry transatlantic
mail for the United States postoffice department. Not
only did Rosendahl call attention to the commercial
possibilities of the dirigible but he defended it as a
military instrument. He stressed the value of the
"cloud chair" in which an observer can be lowered
3.000 feet to reix&gt;rt enemy surface craft and observe
enemy movements on the ground while the dirigible
itself remained hidden in the clouds. According to
Rosendahl the Macon can carry airplanes that may take
off and be picked up more easily than from an airplane
carrier.

Boston Police Use New Radio
The new two-way radio equipment to be used by the
Boston police in their cruisers promises to make ex-
ceedingly difficult the path of the unrighteous. The
Beantown burglar henceforward will be haunted by
the disconcerting thought that the very ordinary look-
ing sedan parked across the street may contain a burly
representative of the law who is even now conversing
with headquarters' about the capture of said burglar.
Boston plans soon to equip 15 out of 19 of its divisions
with cruisers having two-way radio communication.
The transmitters will operate on a wave length of 8
meters although at present the great majority of police
radio systems operate satisfactorily with the use of the
medium-high frequencies. Advantages of the use of
the high-frequency are that these bands are less
crowded, less interference is encountered, and the an-
tenna installations are less awkward and expensive.
The communication range of this equipment is how-
ever limited to a few miles. The signals are propa-
gated somewhat as a beam of light and, as a result of
the curvature of the earth, are projected off into space
soon after leaving the transmitter. The division head-
quarters that are located far from the center of the divi-
sion will have special auxiliary receivers on the opposite

the territory will be assured.
. The stationary transmitter for the system will bf
located in the general headquarters and will he con-
nected hy telephone lines to the division houses. The
power transmitters in the various precincts will have
slightly different frequencies, but the receivers in all
cars will be tuned to the frequency of the transmitter
at headquarters. The receivers in the division houses
will be tuned to the car transmitters in their respective
divisions.

Who's Where among
Michigan Engineers
It might be of interest to you oldtimers to know that
traditions are once more coming into vogue this year.
The freshman class has more spirit than has been seen
for several seasons, and the sophomores did right well
in upholding their honor. As per usual custom, the
freshmen congregated in a huge mob several nights
before Black Friday and proceeded to go after any
sophs they happened to know of. Result, several miss-
ing pairs of pants, and several duckings in the river.
And so on the night of Hlack Friday the spirit of battle
was in the air, and after the Pep meeting the sophs col-
lected in small and effective groups and proceeded to
pick off stragglers from the main body of the freshmen
and to remove therefrom the nether garments (pants
to you). Reports have it that the Union Pants Ex-
change did a rousing business. And so from campus
capers we turn to the doings of those who used to
make Black Friday interesting.

One-quarter Million Amperes
One of the outstanding fields in electrical research,
is that of lightning protection, and in this respect much
advance has been made. Recently, electrical discharges
have been developed which greatly exceed any lightning
stroke yet recorded. The cover shows a discharge of
one-quarter million amperes which was developed in
this undertaking. This current is sufficient to vaporize
a copper wire one-tenth inch in diameter, or to com-
pletely smash a section of reinforced concrete, similar
to lightning bolts. The mechanical forces involved are
of such a degree that copper strips capable of carrying
the current are completely pinched or what is more,
two iron bars of sufficient diameter that they will not
explode, if bent apart a distance of one inch, will l&gt;e
pulled together by the "pinch effect" with such a force
that they will be flattened where they strike. The dis-
charge is produced by ninety-six 50,000 volt Pyranol-
filled capacitors producing 150,000 volts and charged
with the ordinary 110 volt, 60 cycle current. The pur-
pose of such studies is the prevention of power inter-
ruptions due to lightning.

A. I. E. E. Active
The student branch of the A. I. E. E. held its usual
tri-weekly meeting on Nov. 1, and was addressed by
L. N. Turner and R. Foley.
Mr. Turner spoke of his experiences while connected
with the American Tel. and Tel. Co. His talk dealt
with his experience in their training school, putting
particular emphasis on the type of studies to engineers
and also the type of work in which a graduate engineer
might find himself.
Mr. Foley next spoke to the meeting of his connec-
tions with the Consumers Power Co. with references
to their recent change from 25 to 60 cycle current in
the Grand Rapids area. The problems of design and
actual operation during this transformation were then
discussed.
A short business meeting and refreshments followed
Mr. Foley's talk. It is hoped that all electricals will
take advantage of these informal gatherings to broaden
their acquaintance with their field.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


DURING the past few years it has become apparent that the editorial
policy of the Michigan Technic is not fully in accord with the interest
of the students. This fact has caused the entire staff much concern,
with the result that we at this time wish to announce a drastic change, to take
place in the December issue.
Make we take a moment to explain—Years ago, when the Michigan
Technic was established, it was the medium of publication for the faculty and
student papers which were presented before the Engineering Society, of which
every student was a member. From an annual, it grew to be a semi-annual,
then a quarterly and finally a monthly publication. When the Engineering
Society died a natural death, due partly to the growth of the college and partly
to the establishment of the student branches of the professional societies, the
Technic carried on with its original policy.
Today the field of technical publication is amply covered by the various
professional journals, and there is little need for the Technic to remain in it
to the degree that it has heretofore attempted. We have therefore decided that
while we shall not entirely abandon the publication of engineering articles
written by students, faculty members and prominent alumni, we shall mate-
rially reduce the amount of space which has been devoted to that type of
material.
In short, we feel that the magazine should be given back to the students.
It can be made to serve a very useful purpose for the students, faculty and
alumni of the College of Engineering at the University of Michigan. This
purpose will best be served by establishing the Technic as a magazine which
will actively promote the unity, well-being and forward progress of the college.
To accomplish this purpose, we have adopted the following policies:
1. To aid the Engineering Council in its role of unifying factors for all
of the organizations in the College of Engineering, by carrying news of the
various activities, by publishing a monthly calendar and by offering the services
of the Technic in any project for the benefit of the College.
2. To bring about a closer acquaintance among the students by empha-
sizing the personal note in the magazine, and by enlarging the Engineering
Spotlight to include outstanding students from all four classes.
3. Along the same line, to present caricatures and short biographies of
our professors.
4. To present articles concerning the various engineering curricula and
combined courses, in order to acquaint the student with the possibilities in the
various fields.
5. To present the students' viewpoint, by welcoming every type of con-
tribution—advice, criticism, articles, letters to the Editor on your "pet peeve,"
etc. Contribution boxes will be located at strategic points, for your con-
venience.
6. To devote an entire section to news of student organizations. As the
publication of the Engineering College, the Technic should be the official
organ of the societies in the College.
7. To conduct a department listing the worthwhile articles appearing in
current professional journals and literary magazines.
8. To offer suggestions and aid toward securing employment during the
summer and after graduation.
9. To keep students and alumni informed of significant developments in
research here at the University.
The adoption of these principles will, we are certain, bring us nearer to
our objective, that of Being YOC7R magazine.

College Review
w
Synthetic Products Discussed by Prof. White
On October 29. 1934, Prof. .Alfred H. White, head
of the Department of Chemical Engineering, gave a
lecture in Natural Science Auditorium on "Synthetic
Products for Clothes and Houses."
Notwithstanding the fact that many synthetic mate-
rials were known and have been used for over a thou-
sand years, the greatest change with regard to synthetic
products for clothes and houses has occurred within
the last one hundred years. The chemical industry has
been the forerunner of many articles which we use
daily for our convenience and comfort. The growth
of the automobile industry, a necessary adjunct of
modern homes and home life, has resulted in astounding
changes in the steel, rubber, paint, and light metal
industries. Wood is being replaced by artificial fibre-
boards; paint industries have turned to lacquers; glass
has become shatter-proof: and metals are becoming
lighter and stronger.
The construction of houses has not changed radically
in the last hundred years because individuality prevents
the construction of houses by mass-production, like
automobiles. Nevertheless, the interiors of homes have
changed extensively, for they are now protected from
heat and cold by insulation products and are decorated
by numerous articles made synthetically. One of the
interesting changes brought about by the demand for
fine clothing is the manufacture of rayon, a fibre which
is an accomplishment of chemical ingenuity. Many syn-
thetic products made from organic compounds are con-
tinually rising to the front to replace products which
do not completely satisfy the world of today.

Transportation Club Elects
The Transportation Club, a member of the Asso-
ciated Traffic Clubs of America, met recently to elect
officers and formulate plans for the coming year. The
club exists for the benefit of those students who are
interested in any phase of transportation.
The following officers were elected for the year:
George Rugge. '35E President
Solomon Kaplan, '35E ....Senior vice-president
Noble Ashley, '36E Junior vice-president
Edward Jaros, '3SE Secretary
Joseph Vercoe. '35E Treasurer
Charles Ducharme. Spec Executive Council
Edward Morrison. '37E Executive Council
At a special meeting of the officers Paul E. Kissin-
ger, '35E, was elected to the Engineering Council as
club representative. A vote of support was also given
to the Aero Branch of the A.S.M.E. with regard to
that organization's membership in the Engineering
Council.
On October 24, the members of the club heard Prof.
Bull of the E.E. department speak on the "Pennsyl-
vania Railroad Electrification Projects." The talk was
supplemented by slides especially prepared for the lec-
ture by the General Electric Company.
The club plans to make inspection trips to Detroit.

In A Jointless-Minded World
Welding would prevail—and old methods of joining could
not be restored to favor.
By E. A. DOYLE*
If welding had become the stand-
ard method of manufacture before
mechanical types of joints were in-
troduced, it would be difficult, in-
deed, to convince manufacturers that
they should redesign their metal
products to use mechanical methods
of joining.
NO RETREAT—pipe line con-
structors would never consent to a
change from simple, portable weld-
ing equipment to the complicated
devices essential to other methods.
Welding Gives Strength
Strength would be a talking point
for welding. The welded joint is
strong as or stronger than the metal
which it joins. The cutting of holes
for screws or bolts would naturally
weaken the structure. Appearance
gives welding another vote. Joints
made by welding are smooth in con-
tour and have no depressions, bosses,
projections or attachments as is often
necessary in mechanical means of
joining metals.
Costs Less to the User
Cost would be another argument
for welded joints. The greater amount
of material necessary with mechani-
cal joints, the increased weight, and
the decrease in pay load or perform-
ance-to-weight ratio, would make
welding the preferred method. No-
body would consent to a joint in
piping, which might, through a tiny
leak cost much more than the per-
manently leakproof welded joint.
Nor should it be necessary to buy
expensive machinery to make me-
chanical joints which welding can
equal in performance, economy and
adaptability with a minimum invest-
ment in metal fabricating equipment.
Modernizes Automobile
Design
Automobile manufacturers would
insist on welding rather than consent
to a return to the design limitations
imposed by mechanical joints. In
face of a change from "teardrop"
designs to the old boxlike bodies,
with the attendant discomforts, with
higher cost due to increased gas con-

METAL FURNITURE—The
welded joints in metal beds, chairs
and other similar furniture assure
a sturdy and rigid assembly.
sumption and increased tire wear,
with the fear of accidents increased
by the lack of confidence in the
joints, with appearance impaired
and lacking the smooth surface for
fine paint and lacquer finishes,—the
automobile manufacturer would hes-
itate long before any but welded
joints would even get a hearing.
In the Future
Farsighted industrial executives
can appreciate that a completely
"welding-minded" industrial world
is not far off. They should use in
their own manufacturing operations
as many of the advantages of weld-
ing as possible. The welding engi-
neers of The Linde Air Products
Company can advise how oxy-
acetylene welding could best be used

How DO They Do It?
For the benefit of those who have wondered how
this magazine was put out anyway, here's the dope:
4:45. Three members of staff in office; two seated,
one reading yesterday's Daily, other reading Sports-
man Pilot. One standing, looking over pictures on
walls. Two enter. One sits on radiator and pulls blind
up and down. Other sits on desk and looks around.
Three more come in. General conversation ensues.
5 :00. Time for meeting. Someone asks where Wag-
ner is. He is somewhere over in West Engine seeing
somebody. Conversation returns to normal. Staff mem-
bers enter at regular intervals.
5:05. Marshall enters, (loud cheers), rushes to desk
and begins shoving drawers out and in violently. De-
mands to know where next month's copy is.
5 :07. Someone asks where Wagner is. He will be
right up. General flow of conversation resumes.
5:09. Wagner enters, (very loud cheers), carrying
envelopes, packages, and assorted paraphernalia, and
immediately announces meeting will be in room 3205.
Staff slowly filters out of office and down the hall.
Every third one stops at fountain for drink. Wagner
tacks sign on door saying meeting will be in room 3205.
and brings up the rear.
First three arrivals at 3205 make dive for davenport.
Fourth comes along and makes them move over.
Others arrive and shoo studying students out of the
room, telling them there is a Technic staff meeting
scheduled. One student wants to know what Technic
is.
Rest of staff enter and settle back comfortably on
chairs. Members on davenport still more comfortable.
Wagner sits down at head of table and shuffles papers.
Opens meeting and says that Taylor has something to
say. Taylor announces new sales and subscription
drive and calls for volunteers. Asks for salesmen for
8 o'clock Monday. No response. Wagner says he will
take it. Volunteers asked for rest of day: names taken.
Volunteers asked for 8 o'clock Tuesday. No res]&gt;onse.
Taylor says he will take it himself.
Wagner asks Sloane anxiously if that ad has been
obtained. Sloane wakes up with start and reports all
okay. Wagner appears happy, and continues talking.
Late arrival enters with composed demeanor. Door
makes racket, (laughter) ; late arrival loses composure
and sits down. Wagner continues talking, telling of
bigger and better magazines to come. Second late ar-
rival enters unobtrusively. Door makes racket, ( laugh-
ter) : second late arrival loses unobtrusiveness and sits
down with bright, interested expression. Wagner con-
tinues talking and tells of new and improved features
in the magazine. Asks opinion of staff members. Sev-
eral grunt. Wagner continues talking and finally runs
out of material. Everyone looks around and meeting
is declared ended. Staff filters out of meeting room.

Though they weren't quite enough,
Sadie still had some brains.
So she coyly threw glances
At the sap on her right,

TWO POLES IN ONE
Radio entertainment and "•airmail" have been
sent to the Antarctic through General Electric's
short-wave station W2XAF, ever since Rear Admiral
Byrd arrived there last year. Recently, in con-
junction with a Byrd program, another was sent
out to Rockwell Kent and his son in the Arctic
region—thus linking simultaneously Americans who
are, in the matter of latitude, farthest apart.
Governor McNutt of Indiana and other prominent
Hoosiers spoke to the Byrd Expedition from
Indianapolis in a program sponsored by the Indian-
apolis Star. Immediately afterward, the Coffee
House Club, an organization of artists and writers
to which Rockwell Kent belongs, sent music and
greetings from New York to him on the island of
Ubekjent, just off the coast of Greenland, 600 miles
within the Arctic circle. Features of this program
were special greetings from Mrs. Kent and her
daughter, and a talk in the Eskimo language by
Vilhjalmar Steffanssen, Arctic explorer, for the
benefit of the natives. Both programs were broad-
cast over a coast-to-coast NBC network as well as
by short waves.

unsightly smokestack, barred the way to certain
necessary improvements and landscape develop-
ments on the campus. This summer the old boilers
and the smokestack were torn down. In one of the
buildings of the old plant stand 120 General Electric
oil furnaces arranged in circular groups of five. Fifty-
two more G-E oil furnaces are installed in the smaller
or more isolated buildings of the campus, operating
singly, in pairs, and, in one instance, in a battery
of 10. In the central plant, only as many groups of
furnaces will operate as are necessary to maintain the
required steam pressure. The remainder will be shut
down, avoiding stand-by losses. The individual
furnaces and small groups in distant buildings permit
the abandonment of some of the longer runs in the
underground steam-distribution network. The high
efficiency of the system is expected to produce
savings which will pay for the installation in five
to seven years. In addition, as a result of the more
careful regulation of temperature, it is expected
that health conditions at the college will be con-
siderably improved.
The main plans for the system were drawn up by
C. W. Colby, consulting engineer. D. W. McLenegan,
Wisconsin, '21, assistant engineer of the Air Con-
ditioning Department; W. O. Lum, and H. R. Crago,
Penn State, '18, both of the same department,
handled engineering details for General Electric.
FLYING POWER PLANT
Gold was discovered in 1925 along the Bulola River
in New Guinea, an island just north of Australia.
Prospectors worked the richer veins by hand
methods, and packed their "take" on the backs of
natives through 40 miles of cannibal-infested and
nearly impassable jungles to Lae on the coast.
After the best veins had been worked out, it became
apparent that placer operations on a large scale
would pay if the necessary dredges and other
machinery could be brought to the location. Land
transportation was impossible, so a plane was sent
in. The pilot found a spot to land, and a flying field
was cleared off.
Four 875-kv-a. General Electric waterwheel gener-
ators were among the equipment ordered. When
they arrived at Lae, they were transferred to huge
all-metal Junkers freight planes and flown to the
location piece by piece. The largest single pieces
had a net weight of 6545 pounds. As the load limit
of the planes is 7000 pounds, it was a tight squeeze.
D. B. Gearhart, Iowa State, '27, of International
General Electric, Inc., handled the order for the
Company.

FROM BASIC MATERIALS TO FINISHED PRODUCT
The fact that Dow manufactures most of the raw materials
used in the production of its more than 250 chemical
products insures maximum control of quality and mainte-
nance of standards.
The flow chart below shows the various steps in the pro-
duction of Dow Phenol and serves to illustrate the above
statement. The basic raw materials are brine pumped from
deep wells and benzol. Several preliminary products are
made before Phenol is finally produced. This affords
numerous opportunities to eliminate impurities which are
objectionable in the final product. Evidence that this
actually occurs can be found in the fact that Dow Phenol
has a congealing point of over 40° C.
The control of raw materials through basic manufacturing
processes is equally important in the manufacture of other
Dow products which have such high standing in the
markets of the world.
Just as Dow Phenol, U.S.P., is manufactured by an original
Dow process in the world's largest and most modern synthetic
Phenol plant, so are other Dow products manufactured by
original processes from carefully controlled raw materials.

AN EVER WAKEFUL
ELECTRIC EYE
Scientific American and Crosh-y Radio Cor/*.
The frontispiece depicts the base of the enormous
900,000 lb., 831-foot vertical antenna tower of Crosley's
pioneer station, WLW at Cincinnati. The base con-
tains a safety gap which grounds the electrical energy
collected from the atmosphere by the mast. When
this charge is great enough to jump the gap, a "power
follow-up arc" will be formed which will drain off and
ground virtually all of the station's 500,000 watts. In
order to prevent this a photo-cell keeps a constant
watch over the safety and instantly actuates a series
of relays when the first arc is formed. These relays
shut off the radio transmitter for a split second, effec-
tively preventing the "follow-up arc."


H. WARREN UNDERWOOD, '36E
There is only one of its kind in existence, true
enough—but then again, there is only one John S.
Worley in existence—and without the one, it would he
impossible to have the other. The entire history and
present condition of the Transportation Library at the
University of Michigan is so closely linked with the
name of Professor John S. Worley that one must tell
the story of the past decade of one in order to tell of
the first decade of the other.
It all started back around 1922. At this time Prof.
Worley was a consulting railroad engineer in New
York, and he had occasion to do some research in the
general subject of Transportation, so he went to the
New York City Public Library and delved into the
prodigious files of that institution, but to his dismay
could not find the desired classifications. Being per-
sonally acquainted with the head Librarian, he went
to him and explained the nature of his misson. That
worthy explained that the New York Public Library
"had everything," and proceeded to "show him." But
to the most worthy gentleman's surprise he also found
nothing. True enough, many Books on the subject
were present, but catalogued solely by authors, which
was of little value to the man in search of new mate-
rial. So Prof. Worley went elsewhere in search of
information.
Next his search led him to the Library of Congress
in Washington, where the root of all published knowl-
edge is supposedly located, but here likewise his search
proved fruitless. This was indeed an alarming situ-
ation. Transportation. America's second largest in-
dustry, was without any properly catalogued body of
reference material.
Along about this time (the fall of 1923) The Trans-
portation Department was set up on the Michigan
campus, and John S. Worley was imported to become
its head. This gave him the opportunity for which he-
had been looking, the opportunity to build up a library
on the subject of Transportation in the manner in
which he thought it should be built up, Prof. Worley
rolled up his sleeves and went to work. He had able
assistance from many in his project. Prof. Henry E
Riggs of the Civil Engineering Dept. found space in
his Department to house the venture. Dr. W. W.
Bishop, librarian of the University, gave his advice and
assistance in setting up the library as a branch of the
University library. Financial aid was given by Alex
Dow of the Detroit Edison Company, C. S. Mott of
Flint, Roy Chapin of Detroit, and the Ford, Reo, Hud-
son and Dodge Brothers Motor Companies. With
these funds and the donations of private individuals
the start was made, and has continued until today there
are about 100,000 items in the collection, catalogued
so that they may be used for Transportation research.
When complete it is estimated that the library will con-
tain about half a million items.
The precise aims and purposes of the institution are
set forth by the board of directors as follows:
1. It is highly essential to the courses in transporta-
tion in the University that material for definite and
real research problems should be available. Nothing
inspires young men so much as contact with a really
comprehensive library, and nothing benefits them as
much as a historical background for life work.
2. There exists a wealth of really fine literature on
the subject of transportation, much of it going back to
the period from 1775 to 1850, and this should by all
means be preserved.
3. Every industry should know its own history. Such
a library will make it easy to encourage research in
transportation and the writing of such books as Phil-
lip's "History of the Railroads of the Southern Cotton
Belt." Bradley's "History of the Santa Fe" and Brown-
son's "History of the Illinois Central," all of which
were written as theses for doctor's degrees.
4. The library will be invaluable for research by
students in history and economics as well as for those
in the engineering colleges, and it will make available
to transportation and utility companies complete files of

original source material for
such uses as they may re-
quire from time to time,
particularly in legal mat-
ters.
The available material is
divided into the following
principal subjects:
Waterways
I -and Transportation
Communication
Transportation by Pipe-lines Public Utilities
All of this mass of material is contained in various
forms. An idea of the diversity of available sources
may he gleaned from this sketch outline of the types
of publications: Texts and Reference hooks, Docu-
ments. Manuals, Periodicals, Society Proceedings. Re-
ports, Laws and Charters, Correspondence and Per-
sonal Papers, Prints and Pictures, Annual Reports of
Companies, Maps and Atlases, Lantern Slides. Cer-
tainly there is a wide diversity of material, and it is
apparent that only a small portion of it is of a tech-

nical nature. Much of it is of extreme interest to the
casual browser. Of especial interest to the casual are
a group of original Currier and Ives, and Ackernian
Prints, some old wood-cuts of early attempts at self-
propelled vehicles, and four early Japanese Railway
Prints.
This library is the only one
of its kind in existence, and
is grow-ing every day. Prof.
Worley is in constant contact
with individuals all over the
world in the acquisition of
new material. Such is already
the reputation of this small
collection that people come
from everywhere to utilize the
facilities of the library. Prof.
Worley will not he satisfied,
however, until everything per-
tinent to the subject of trans-
portation is listed in the libra-
ry files.

Flame Control - -
the Secret of Forging Steel
D. W. MURPHY
Research Associate
Dept. of Engineering Research
The shaping of steel for a finished product may be
divided into two general types of operations, hot work-
ing and cold working. Forging and pressing are in-
cluded under the first classification, whereas stamping
and extruding are examples of the second type of op-
eration. The hot fabrication of steel, of course,
requires some method of heating to temperatures of
1800° F. and higher.
When steel is heated to too high a temperature in the
forging furnace a ''burned" forging results. A
"burned" forging is usually evidenced by the presence
of intercrystalline cracks in the microstructure of the
metal. These cracks may or may not extend to the
outside of the forging. It is of considerable impor-
tance, then, to know under what conditions "burning"
may result so that it may be prevented.
The temperature at which any given steel will burn
is dependent upon its composition and also upon the
type of flame it encounters in the furnace. In a re-
search program conducted in the Department of Engi-
neering Research for the American Gas Association it
was found that the use of a flame deficient in air would
permit the steel to be heated to a considerably higher
temperature than when a flame having an excess of air
was used. This temperature difference between the
"burning" points of the same steel in the two types of
flames amounted to as much as 125° F. in the case of
low carbon steels and gradually decreased as steels of
higher carbon content were employed. Furthermore it
was observed in the presence of flames deficient in air
the "burning" temperatures for a steel of a certain
carbon content could be taken as that temperature at
which the steel begins to liquefy, i.e., the liquidus line
of the iron-carbon diagram was found to coincide
with the "burning" temperatures of steels of different
carbon contents when and only when the steels were
heated in flames deficient in air. Because of the in-
creased production of sound forgings made possible
with higher forging temperatures, this ability of air
deficient flames to raise the apparent burning temper-

flames carrying an excess of air is a fact of great im-
portance.
Another of the consequences.of the application of
heat to steel is scaling or oxidation. An extensive
investigation of the effects of the constituents of the
products of combustion, of temperature and of the
composition of the steel on the scaling of steel also
formed a part of the research work carried on for the
American Gas Association. The composition of the
products of combustion has a very considerable influ-
ence on the extent of scale formation. For instance
at 2300° F. if city gas is burned first with an excess of
air. 6 cubic feet of air to 1 of gas. and then with the
theoretical amount of air for complete combustion. 4.75
cubic feet of air to 1 of gas, it will be observed that
the scaling losses of low carbon steel are reduced by
about 18 per cent. As less air is used per cubic foot
of gas the scaling losses decrease very slowly, until a
ratio of about 3 of air to 1 of gas is reached ; at which
point the scaling has been reduced another 13 per cent.
Then the losses decrease very rapidly until at a ratio
of 2 of air to 1 of gas the scaling is all but eliminated.
At higher temperatures the effects of excess air in in-
creasing scaling losses are even more pronounced.
Excess air. which shows up in an analysis of furnace
gases as free oxygen, is certainly to be avoided in oper-
ating forging furnaces, both because of its action in
lowering the burning temperature of a steel and be-
cause of its effect in increasing scaling losses.
Temperature also plays an important part in the
scaling of steel, the losses increasing steadily with in-
creasing temperature. As an example, the losses due
to scaling of a steel when exposed to the products of
combustion of city gas and air may be compared at
several different temperatures with the losses at 2000
R. At 2100 F. the losses are 1.6 times those at 2000
F.. at 2200 F. they are 2.1 times the loss at 2000 F„
at 2300 F.. 2.7 times as great; and at 2400T F., 3.8
times as large. Up to 2300 F.. the increase in scaling
losses brought about by increasing temperature is fairy
regular, amounting to about 30 per ent for each 100 F.
but above 2300 F. the rate of increase becomes much
greater. The effect of the temperature factor on these
losses is such that it is necessary in the consideration
of a certain forging job to balance the increase in pro-
duction, resulting from higher temperature forging op-
erations, against the question of whether or not the job
requires that scaling be kept as low as possible.
Another factor in the scaling of steel at forging
temperatures is its composition. In both the alloy and
plain carbon steels it has been observed that the low
and the high carbon materials (.15-.30%C and .80-
1.20%C) scale at lower rates than steels of intermedi-
ate carbon contents. High speed steel of the tungsten
type is an exception; but in this case the influence of
the high carbon, which tends to lower the scaling losses,
is overshodovved by the large amount of tungsten.
Gas Furnace Used for Investigation of Burning and Scaling
This element is very easily oxidized. W hile nearly
every steel may possess its own specific scaling rate,
in general their behavior with regard to combustion
atmospheres is the same, namely, that excess air in
firing decidedly increases scaling and that firing with
deficient air. though diminishing scaling, is not effec-
tive in eliminating scale until the deficiency becomes
quite large.
Finally, it is desirable to point out that small amounts
of sulphur hearing gases such as sulphur dioxide in the
products of combustion are extremely effective in in-
creasing scaling losses. As little as 0.1% of sulphur
dioxide in the products of complete combustion will
nearly double the scaling losses at 2300 F. as com-
pared with those losses observed in atmosphere free
from sulphur. The surfaces of forgings resulting from
heating in combustion products containing sulphur may
be very seriously damaged by absorption of this ele-
ment. Steels containing nickel are particularly sensi-
tive to sulphuric gases.
This study of the forging process, while not com-
plete, has shown some very practical possibilities. Defi-
nite knowledge has been obtained regarding the con-
ditions under which "burning" of a steel forging will
occur and the scaling of steel has been recognized as a
consequence of the heating operation. A considerable
degree of control can be accomplished through the use
of efficient and well constructed furnaces and the selec-
tion of proper fuels.

The Function of the Bureau of Occupational Information
T. LUTHER PURDOM, Director
The University Bureau of Appointments and Occu-
pational Information has for its main function the
placement of University people in the business world.
It is a separate organization, not under the supervision
of any college but directly responsible to the President
of the University. The service of the Bureau is free
to any one who has had work at Michigan. The types
of positions cover the widest range possible and the
types of training asked for also have no limitations.
Many engineering students have registered with the
Bureau and an increasing number are taking advantage
of the opportunity each semester. Most of the service
which the Bureau has recently been able to render to
engineers has been to the alumni, particularly those
people who have been out in the business world for a
few years and during this depression have found them-
selves without positions.
To register means to bring together in a very concise
and compact manner information concerning the appli-
cant's high school training, the number of hours he has
had at the University of Michigan in the various de-
partments, the work he has had in other institutions,
his working or teaching experience, the types of posi-
tions he would like to have, the type of extra-curricular
work he has been interested in, something of his
achievements, the locality he prefers, and other types
of information which present a good picture of him.
Along with this type of information we ask that the
registrant secure recommendations from at least three
faculty members and also from any former employers
he may have had. When a
person has one registered and
is desirous of being kept on
the active list, his record In-
comes an accumulative one Ire-
cause information each year is
added to it to bring it up-to-
date and usable at a moment's
notice.
The Bureau, on the other
hand, has built up a great
deal of information concern-
ing sixty of the leading pro-
fessions, and it tries to furnish
any one registered with infor-
Mr. Purdom mation about the various pro-
fessions in which the individual is interested. The
Bureau also has a great deal of information about
hundreds of organizations and business concerns both
in this and in some foreign countries, whih is available
to students when they are desirous of making a choice
and want to make the best connection jxjssible.
In addition to this type of information, the Bureau
offers to all those individuals who are interested a type
of service which helps them get a good look at them-
selves from the standpoint of their capabilities and
desires, by means of various tests which have been
devised for this purpose. In doing this the Bureau is
trying to give the individual a chance to see the qual-
ities which he lias in comparison with those which are
demanded by the various companies. It is true that no
test or information blanks which have been developed
are conclusive in any manner, but there are some which
are of tremendous help and give the individual a chance
to make a better choice and decision than he would
otherwise have.
The technical departments of the Engineering Col-
lege have cooperated admirably with the Bureau, and
have been responsible for most of the placements of
men into highly specialized positions. However, the
Bureau has had an increasing demand for men in differ-
ent walks of life where an engineering background is
of decided importance although the position does not
directly involve engineering. Some of the larger or-
ganizations have asked for men with engineering train-
ing, to be developed into salesmen or executives of var-
ious types, or to do certain kinds of literary work. To
those groups we have been able to render considerable
service. In addition, some of the men who have had
some commercial training have been able to get posi-
tions in the business world as private secretaries, and
this fall a goodly number have gone into the Freshman
Colleges as teachers, teaching chemistry, mathematics,
or commercial work for the most part.
The Bureau could obviously accomplish its purpose
much more successfully if more extensive contacts,
both with business organizations and with the students
and alumni, could be brought about. It has been ham-
pered in achieving this end by a limited budget which
precluded any field work, but has been striving to attain
it through various other means. Some of the depart-
ments of the Engineering College have been planning
with us for the furtherance of this purpose, and it is
Page Forty-six

Alumni Clubs, located in many of the important cities,
have more than cooperated, and the services of six of
them in particular have been enlisted. Both the Alumni
Clubs and the faculty of the Engineering College have
been very helpful in locating men of specific nature to
fill important positions, and likewise in helping trained
men make contacts in their particular localities.
The membership on the Advisory Committee of the
Bureau of Professor Henry C. Anderson. Director of
Student-Alumni Relations and head of the Mechanical
Engineering Department, does much to insure coop-
eration between the Engineering College and the
Bureau.
Registration with the Bureau is entirely optional, and
dependent upon the initiative of the student; and while
we cannot promise positions we do attempt to lend
every aid possible. A great many students have found
that having a complete set of credentials on file has
been of tremendous help to the individuals by having
the Bureau send a copy of them to the organizations
to which they make application and also to many other
companies where the companies have asked for infor-
mation about them. The Bureau is glad to assemble
this information for the students and alumni, to keep
a record up to date with the registrant's cooperation,
and in every way to do what it can to help further one's
cause. So far no charge has been made for any service
rendered, except occasional minor fees for late regis-
tration and similar items.
The Bureau is anxious to cooperate with the depart-
ments of the Engineering College and has found the
members of the departments most helpful in working
with the Bureau.
Marching with the
Fighting Hundred"
"
F. WILLIAM DONOVAN, '37E
The college band with its smart marching and fight
songs, its baton-swinging drum major, and its intricate
formations has become an almost indispensable part of
the entertainment at the Saturday afternoon battles of
the pig-skin tossers. For fifteen minutes, once each
week during the football season, one, or often two
bands march and play in every large football stadium
in the country.
Spelling words, going into and out of complicated
formations under the directions of the strutting drum
major, these bandsmen leave one fairly gasping at the
ease and confidence with which they got out of seem-
ingly hopeless entanglements. Obviously, each man
must have his own assigned place in the regular for-
mations and each must have his place in the letters or
symbols which the unit makes on the field.
The work of planning these movements and formu-
lating directions for each man in the band falls to what
is officially known as the formations committee and in
consideration of all the problems which this committee
has to solve, it might well be called the band's brain
trust.
Consisting of Lieut. Coursey of the R.O.T.C. de-
partment. A. C. Ellis of the Physics department, and
a veteran bandsman, the band manager, the drum
major, and any experienced men who can spare the
time, the formations committee meets of a Thursday
night of the week before the formations are to be used
to decide what they shall be and, to some extent, how
they shall be executed.
The first difficulty to be overcome is that of a drastic
dearth of ideas. After every likely word has been
spelled many times and every possible symbol has been
made, likewise many times, it is up to the formations
committee to "think up a new one." Hence, those
people with good imaginations tempered with a bit of
common sense find their suggestions welcomed with
open arms.
However, an idea having made its unexpected ap-
pearance, the difficulties have only nicely begun. A
miniature football field is laid out on paper and the
formation is drawn on this field in the proper propor-
tions. Then the distribution of the men, with due
regard as to the ease with which each man will be able
to get to his position, is decided upon.
In the Michigan band there are one hundred men to
be placed in every formation, and it is very embar-
rassing to come out five men short or three or four
men too many. Each letter of each word and each
part of such symbols as the compass that was made at
the Northwestern game this year, must be balanced.
That is, the men must be evenly spaced so that the

letters will look neither top heavy nor darker on one
side than on the other.
Such conspicuous instruments as the bass horns must
be located so that they will not unbalance a letter. For
instance, if the letter 1 were made eight men high with
four bass horn players in the top and four clarinet
players in the bottom, the effect would be far from
pleasing. The drum section must be kept together in
all formations for the drums are the pulse of the band
and when spread out, the beat is blurred.
The bass drum is on a par with the whole bass horn
section as a trouble maker. The two carrying it must
be placed in a letter in which they can face in the
direction in which the band will march when the for-
mation is in place. Hence, the drum must be placed
in the horizontal bar of an H. the top or bottom of
a block C or some similar position, so that the men
carrying it may forego the contortions of marching
sideways when the band moves off.
Even now, the patience of the committee must hold
out. All the movements have to be carefully timed,
for the band must obey one rule in the football rule
book. That is. the time allowed between the halves is
fifteen minutes, no more, no less, and the team who's
school the band is representing, may be penalized if
the band holds up the game. Therefore, every move-
ment is allowed a certain time and the fifteen minutes
is carefully budgeted.
Finally, the music must be synchronized with the
marching so that it will fit in with the formation that
is taking place.
The music is arranged and distributed to the men on
the Tuesday of the week it is to be used. The move-
ments are rehearsed on Wednesday and Thursday and
Friday are left to smooth out the rough spots and
bring the entire program to its Saturday afternoon
perfection.
Thus we see that the power behind the band is the
committee which has far more to do than is at first
apparent to the spectator at a football game.
Technical
Brief*
SING-SINGING IN THE ORCHARD
At Massachusetts State College electrocution is being
used as a means of controlling orchard insect pests.
The equipment used consists of a trap of double wire
screen inclosing a 75-vvatt frosted bulb. The insects
are attracted by the light but as they fly toward it they
come in contact with the electrified screens. The cur-
rent at 110 volts is usually powerful enough to cremate
them. The tougher individuals however are merely
killed and collected in a try beneath the trap. An
installation of five of these traps is known to have
killed 1,300 insects in a single night, those which be-
came mere wisps of smoke not being included in the
census.
GULF STREAM IS NOT THE GULF STREAM
Every so often someone comes along with a state-
ment that gives the fulcrum of our mental equlibrium
a sickening jolt. Just now we're referring to Professor
Albert E. Parr, scientific director of the Yale ocean-
ographic expeditions, who startles us with the revele-
tion that our old friend, the Gulf Stream, isn't the
Gulf Stream after all, and should not be allowed to
masquerade any longer. Professor Parr maintains
that since the Gulf of Mexico really lias nothing to do
with this particular ocean current there's no reason for
calling it the Gulf Stream and that we should refuse
to be a party to possible deception in the matter. Ocean-
ographic data, taken in a survey of the Gulf of Mexico

the Gulf waters are quite different from those of the
Carrihean and also of the (so-called) Gulf stream. The
Gulf waters seem to enter into relatively little exchange
with the waters of the surrounding seas and to con-
tribute little or nothing to the waters of the Gulf
stream.
"The observations made." declares Professor Parr,
"provide evidence to prove the theory already advanced
by Danish investigators that the so-called Gulf stream
simply takes the shortest possible route from the Yuca-
tan channel to the Straits of Florida along the north
coast of Cuba, carrying chiefly or exclusively water
brought directly from the Caribbean, with little or no
contribution at all from the Gulf of Mexico."
The term "Florida current" is now gaining wider
usage among oceanograpliers. however Professor Parr
thinks that the "Caribbean current" would be a more
fitting designation.
o
WAVE RING BY NIGHT AND DAY
From the Paris Academy of Sciences comes a report
of the investigations by Dr. B. Decaux and Dr. J. B.
Galle showing the amount of variation in the time re-
quired for short radio waves to travel fixed distances.
It was found that the time required fluctuates rapidly
by night to the extent of about 10 percent while the
time is almost constant during the day.
The note fro man organ pipe was sent from Paris
to Algiers on a wave of 24.15 meters and returned to
Paris on a wave-length of 24.65 meters. The note
received was then combined with the direct note from
the organ pipe, reduced to the same intensity, in a
cathode ray oscillograph. The outgoing note caused a
beam of electrons to vibrate in a vertical direction,
while the incoming note caused it to vibrate horizon-
tally. The result of the combination was a little spot
of light projected on a screen. The spot travelled in an
oval or ellipse, called a Lissajou figure. A variation
in the time required for the note to travel from Paris
to Algiers and back caused the figure to change in
form, becoming either flatter or rounder. At night
these changes are so continuous and rapid that the eye
cannot follow them. A variation in time required of
1-1900 second was detected; the time for the journey
being about 1-100 second. During the day the varia-
tion is very small.

A POTENT VITALIZER
You've probably never heard of acetylcholine, but.
according to Sir Henry Dale of Britain's national insti-
tute for medical research, it's probably one of the most
important substances in the human body and may come
to be of great potential usefulness in medicine. Sir
Henry's theory, which seems to be confirmed by sev-
eral researches, states that every time a thought com-
mands a nerve to move a muscle—which means hun-
dreds of times a second for an active person—a small
spurt of acetylcholine is released in the nerves. This
strange chemical serves to carry the message across
the gap from nerve to muscle. The amount of the
chemical released in each spurt is extremely minute.
Sir Henry has computed that only three molecules
constitute one outpouring. Just to give you an idea
of the size of this amount we might tell you that when
Sir Henry tried to express the weight in grains, he had
to write down 20 zeros to the right of the decimal
point before he came to the first significant figure.
o
FORGET YOUR CALORIES
Despite the old saw to the effect that nobody loves a
fat man the corpulent young male need not look on
the dark side of life. He may find a great deal of
consolation in the conclusions drawn from the records
of accepted entrants to the royal air force and pub-
lished in a London medical journal. In the matters of
capacity to endure severe or prolonged physical stress,
accomplishments in athletic competition, and records
of sick leave and invaliding from service, the heavy-
weights romped off with the honors. Definite relation-
ships were found between varying degrees of body-
build and functional efficiency both as to endurance and
to resistance to disease generally. The records also
show that it is unusual for overweight individuals to
become underweight, and vice versa.

SUBSTITUTING FOR MOTHER NATURE
We have always wondered where Hollywood got all
its old baronial mansions. We noticed especially that
all the wood seemed to be aged beautifully, and it
seemed such a shame for the producers to have to use
such rare and expensive wood.
Well, lately we discovered how they did it. They
take ordinary new wood, soak it in linseed oil for a
few days and then play an oxy-acotylene torch over it
until the wood is charred to a depth of about one-
eighth inch, then remove the charred wood with results
like you see in the cut.

PHILIP A. SINCLETON
Phil Singleton, who is
more interested in engi-
neering than in tangoing
(Gargoyle to the con-
trary) still is ahle to be
in the spotlight of the
Michigan campus. Since
his arrival at the Univer-
sity of Michigan he has
been elected to Phi Eta
Sigma, Triangles, Yul-
cans, and Tau Beta Pi.
During the junior year
Phil was president of
Triangles and he is now
president of Tau Beta Pi. As chairman of the J-Hop
he took the road to fame, shown by his election to the
Gargoyle's select group of Preposterous People. He is
now a member of the Undergraduate Council and
serves as president of the Inter fraternity Council. In
his latter capacity he was one of the delegates to the
convention held in Xew York a few weeks ago. For
all his activities Phil is quiet and unassuming. Those
who know him are glad to be called his friends.
HENRY W. FELKER
Henry W. Fe!-
ker started out
early to do things
here on campus.
As a freshman he
was class vice-pres-
ident. When try-
outs for the Mich-
igan Union were
called he reported
and worked faith-
fully, with the re-
sult that he was
given a position on
one of the commit-
tees during his
sophomore year. As
a junior he was a
member of the Ex-
ecutive Committee of the Union, and became a member
of Triangles. Mines and Toastmasters Clubs. Last
spring he was elected Union vice-president for the En-
gineering College, and if the proposed Men's Council
is adopted, he will represent our college.
ENGINEERS W
Just to prove that engineers do get around to help
make things hum. although kept more than busy by
the press of school work, we've gathered in the
names of some of them.
The success of the twenty-sixth annual Union
()pera ''Give Us Rhythm" was due in no small part
to the efforts of "Ty" Felker, '35, as promotion man-
ager. Richard Morairty, '36, was one of the student
directors of dance. Small bits were played by Ed-
ward Harshbarger, '37, and James Weigand, '37.
Joseph Kempton, '37, James Graham, '37, Ardo
Friend, '37, Burton Kellogg, '36, and W. Don Weid-
ner, '36. had places in the choruses.
The hockey team which is shaping up well this
year, is counting on Dick Berryman, '37, to do a
good job after watching his early practice. Walter
Curtis, '35, is a regular forward on the team, and
Dick Joslin, '36, is expected to star as forward on
the Varsity basketball team.
Tn the realms of track, four engineers stand out.
Clayton Brelsford, '37, set two freshman marks last
year, in the half mile and mile, while his running
3 DO THINGS
mate, Stan Birleson, '37, set a frosh record in the
440-yard dash. Neree Alix, '36, is a varsity two
miler. Another miler is Don Boylan, '35.
Tage Jacobson, '35, class president last year,
played a great part of the season as tackle on the
Varsity football team. Cedric Sweet, '36, playing
his first year for Michigan, did a fine job in the
fullback position. We look for him to continue the
good work next year.
Floyd Sweet, '36, last year's president of the
Glider Club, is second ranking glider pilot in the
United States, having won the distinction at
Elmira, X. Y., this summer.
Some men transferring from other schools as
juniors or seniors find it hard to get acquainted. Not
so with Frank Denison. Frank came all the way
from Texas to take work in the Aero Department.
Although working outside, he found time to handle
very efficiently the informal part of the recent Tau
Beta Pi initiation, and he is a very active member
of the committee in charge of the A.S.M.E. "Roast,"
scheduled for December 19.

A COMPLAINT
Something weighs heavily on our chest—guess this is
the place to get it off, so here goes:
We're disgusted with the lethargy of the Engineer-
ing Council—absolutely. Last year Walter Powers
and Prof. Walter C. Sadler spent many hours revising
the constitution so as to make it a smoothly working
body, and a truly representative body for the Engineer-
ing College. (It is smoothly working—no one ever
hears about its doings.) It was provided that each
class and each organization in the College should have
a representative.
Because it was felt that the officers of each organiza-
tion would be occupied with their own group, the con-
stitution provided that the representative for the Coun-
cil be not an elected officer of the group he represents.
Then each representative could devote his time to the
business of the Council, and to coordinating his group
with the council.
Someone slipped. There is a pretty sickly group of
representatives—true, each man has possibilities, and
does accomplish things in other fields, but where the
Engineering Council is concerned, he is totally lacking
in "push." We suggest that each organization inject
some enthusiasm into his delegate, or else elect a new
one!
The Engineering Council has full power and the ap-
proval of Dean Sadler to run student affairs in the
Engineering College—why not do it!-o
MEN'S COUNCIL PROPOSED
About three weeks ago campus leaders submitted to
the President, Dr. Ruthven, a new form of student
government, to replace the present unwieldy Under-
graduate Council.
This plan is to set up a Men's Council, made up of
the presidents of the Interfraternity Council, the Stu-
dent Christian Association, and the Michigan Union,
the Editor of the Michigan Daily and the Union vice-
presidents of the various colleges. This council would
regulate men's activities exclusively, since the women
already have a well-organized Iwdy of their own, cen-
tering in the Michigan League.
If the plan is adopted, it will be truly democratic for
each college will be represented by its Union vice-
president, who is elected on a non-political basis. The
size of the body will not be too large, so that it should
be able to work efficiently.
One of our engineers, Phil Singleton, had a great
deal to do with drawing up the present plan. The
Engineering Council has placed its stamp of approval
upon it by voting to include our Union vice-president,
Henry Felker, as a memljer of the Engineering Council
if the plan is adopted. This will provide for a direct
working connection between both bodies.
o
MAYBE THERE IS HOPE
The presidents of the Mechanical and Aeronautical
divisions of the A.S.M.E. are to be commended for
the manner in which they are handling their student-
faculty banquet.
Under the name of "The Roast." the banquet is
planned to be anything but the formal affair of other
years. A committee of twenty has been working on
plans and programs to ''roast" both faculty and stu-
dents.
The general idea is to provide some common ground
on which teachers and pupils can forget the classroom
and become better acquainted with each other. Having
the common bond of profession, as we do in the Engi-
neering College, we should be drawn more closely
together than we are, so that we can get the benefit
of each other's friendship, and accomplish things for
the good of ourselves and the College as well.
We feel that this is a step in the right direction.
Our only hope is that the success of this banquet will
encourage other societies to do likewise.
A CHANCE OF POLICY
This issue of the TECH NIC marks a departure from
our former editorial policy. As announced last month,
we are trying to get away from publishing too many
technical articles, and to make the magazine of more
interest to students.
In this issue you will note the enlarged "Spotlight,"
the new magazine review department, articles by stu-
dents concerning the Transportation Library and the
mechanics of the Varsity Band, Dr. Purdom's expla-
nation of the work of his bureau—-all articles of non-
technical nature, but of interest to you students. We'd
like to have your reaction to this type of material, as
long as it is not overdone.
As we explained, we shall not abandon entirely the
publication of articles of a technical nature. Worth-
while articles by students, faculty and alumni will find
their way into our pages. The article of the "burning"
of forged steel in this issue is such a one. Next month
there will appear one or two of the outstanding papers
written for the recent Tau Beta Pi initiation.
Please use the conveniently placed suggestion boxes
for any suggestions, criticism or advice you have to
offer.

STRESSES
STRAINS
This month, the humor column is respectfully dedi-
cated to our professors. They are the fellows who
keep talking up in front of the class, making sleep
practically impossible. They are responsible for spoil-
ing our bluebooks with cross marks after we have put
an hour's work on them, and when rain, epidemic, or 8
o'clocks cut the class in half, they inevitably show up
to blast hopes of a bolt.
The "Wonder" Course
There's no course in engineering that compares with
E. E. 5.
You can count yourself as lucky if you come away
alive.
For none other than Professor Moore this nightmare
course instructs,
And he'll keep you busy mapping fields or pushing air
through ducts.
Oh, you'll look inside a motor and design its inward
guts;
You will look with curves and diagrams and numbers
till you're nuts.
But of all the jobs assigned to you, the worst is map-
ping fields,
For you'll find that hours and hours of work the poor-
est profit yields.
You will dream of Moore in bed at night and curse
him through the day,
And you'll think of ways to kill him—never twice the
same old way.
Yet when all the work is finished, and the motor is
designed:
You have learned a lot of things you never knew be-
fore, you'll find.
And although your brain is battered and your consti-
tution's weak,
You will want to go to A. D. Moore and kiss him on
the cheek!

TAU BETA PI HONORS TWENTY-SIX
On Tuesday, November 20, twenty-six new names
were added to the roll of Tau Beta Pi at the Univer-
sity of Michigan, when twenty-four seniors and two
juniors were formally initiated.
These men, who are selected from the upper quarters
of the senior class and the upper eighth of the junior
class, are of the highest type of student. The purpose
of Tau Beta Pi is expressed in its constitution: "To
mark in a fitting manner those who have conferred
honor upon their Alma Mater by distinguished scholar-
ship and exemplary character as undergraduates in
engineering—." To be so marked is the ambition of
every real student.
Prof. Howard McCluskey, of the Psychology De-
partment, addressed the group at the initiation banquet
on "The Youth Problem in Crime." In his very inter-
esting talk he stressed the part which young people
play in crime today. Besides pointing out actual cases
and the causes for this criminal inclination, Prof.
McCluskey gave some concrete remedies for the situ-
ation, and left the diners with a much better under-
standing of a pertinent social problem.
The evening was saddened because Prof. A. D.
Moore, traditional toastmaster, was unable to be pres-
ent on account of the serious condition of Mrs. Moore,
who was injured in an automobile accident.
Prior to the formal initiation the men were required
to study the constitution, to write a paper on some
phase of engineering and to take a four hour exam-
ination of general knowledge. A prize was awarded
for the best written paper. First place was a tie be-
tween William P. Kennedy, '35 aero, for his paper
"Stratosphere Flight" and Raymond B. Foley, '35 elec-
trical, writing on "Flectric Welding." Russell W.
Houvener. '35 chemical, placed second for his dis-
cussion of materials for the construction of streamline
railway trains.
Other interesting subjects were "The Development
of the Rear-Engine Automobile," "The Influence of
Sales Appeal in Engineering Desigfi," "The Method of
Testing Ship Models and Application of Results," "Tri-
angulation," "Photo-Elasticity," "An Automobile Fuel
College Review
of Ten Percent Ethyl Alcohol and Gasoline," and "Air
Conditioning Today and Tomorrow." It is hoped to
publish some of these in the near future. Anyone in-
terested in reading any of the papers can secure infor-
mation in the Michigan Technic office.
Besides the men mentioned above, there were: sen-
iors—mechanical, Lawrence W. Lentz, Albert C.
Haisch, Robert W. Sloane, John English, Joe A. Gay,
August Frankenna, I. Fred Patt; electrical. Nathaniel
Batter, Ross C. Plewes, Edgar C. Vardon; chemical,

A.S.M.E. STUDENT-FACULTY BANQUET,
DECEMBER 19th
The annual student-faculty get-together of the Me-
chanical and Aeronautical Engineering Departments
is to take place this year at the Union on the Wednes-
day evening preceding the Christmas holidays. The
purpose of the banquet is to make it possible for the
students to meet their professors and to become ac-
quainted with them outside of the classroom. Professor
John E. Brumm. of the School of Journalism, has been
persuaded to give the talk. Everyone who has ever
experienced his keen and humorous addresses will be
sure to attend.
At the regular meeting of the Student-Branch, on
November 14th, Professor L. J. Young of the School
of Forestry and Conservation spoke to the members
on the subject of conservation and reforestation in the
United States. It was very interesting to learn that
although one-third of the usable timber which was
available at the time of the founding of the Original
Colonies had been consumed in this country, that by
a rigorous program of planting and selective cultiva-
tion the Nation's annual lumber requisition could be
supplied from our own forests. The Professor also
pointed out how the engineer has a good deal to learn
about wood as a material of construction.

AERONAUTICAL ENGINEERS' DIVISION, A.S.M.E.
On Saturday, November 17, sixty members of the
Aeronautical Engineers' Division of the A.S.M.E., ac-
companied by Professors Pawlowski, Stalker and
Thompson, and their faculty advisor, Mr. Springer,
went on an inspection trip to Selfridge Field, Mt.
Clemens, Michigan. They were shown around the
shops and hangars by Lt. Gimmler of the 94th Squad-
ron, who explained the points of interest, and pointed
out various types of construction used on the airplanes
stationed at the field.
After the inspection tour, the members remained for
the exhibitions put on by the members of the First
Pursuit Group, and the Mitchell Trophy Race, which
was held later in the afternoon.
The organization is planning ins]&gt;ection trips to
neighboring aircraft factories and other places of inter-
est for the near future.
A speaker, Captain C. V. Burnett, was obtained for
the December meeting, which was held Dec. 3, 1934,
at the Union. Captain Burnett is the manager of the
Detroit City Airport, and was able to tell the Aero-
nautical Engineers many things which are of vital in-
terest to them in the field of air transport operation.
TRANSPORTATION CLUB
On November 22, the members of the club were
addressed by Professor R. B. Hall, of the geography
department, who spoke on "The Road System of Feudal
Japan." Professor Hall has done extensive field work
in Japan, and has walked practically the whole distance
covered by these old roads. The character and types
of roads were discussed, followed by a description of
the types of villages along the routes. Professor Hall
compared the feudal Japanese system of roads to that
of ancient Rome. The talk was illustrated by slides
and an informal discussion followed.
On Friday, November 23, fifteen members of the
club made the first inspection trip of the year to the
shops of the Michigan Central Railroad at Jackson.
Here the students, under the direction of Professor
Walter Sadler, were shown through the main shops,
where nearly fifteen locomotives were undergoing a
complete overhauling, a job which takes a month as a
rule. From here they went through the power house,
where the company is installing two new boilers of the
latest type. Next visited was the forge shop, contain-
ing the forges and electric furnaces and steam ham-
mers. The last building on the visit was the round-
bouse, containing space for forty-three locomotives.
The next trip will probably not be held until after
the Christmas holidays. These trips are open to mem-
bers of the Transportation Club only but anyone inter-

FOUR SENIORS BECOME VULCANS
Four men were initiated into Yulcans, honor society
for senior engineers, on Wednesday, Noveml&gt;er 21.
After receiving their coat of lamp black, the men went
through the traditional ordeal of fire building in Yul-
cans forge, anvil pounding and the trip through the
nether regions which underlie the campus.
A banquet was held at the Michigan Union in the
evening at which time they were welcomed into the
group. Delbert Hesler. Robert Zapp. Henry Merker
and Oliver S]&gt;ark were the men so honored.
Professor H. C. Anderson. Director of Student-
Alumni Relations and head of the Department of Me-
chanical (Engineering, spoke to the group concerning
its own organization and its relation to University
activities, stressing the importance of its duties in stu-
dent government.
Pete With His Creation
VAN WINCEN PRESENTS "BENT"
"Dedicated to the members of 1933" there stands in
the lobby of East Engineering Building a magnificent
bronze "bent." twenty-seven times the size of the ac-
tual Tau Beta I'i key.
This "bent" is the work of Peter M. Van Wingen.
'33, who spent hours and hours, first in drawing up
the plans (he was aided in this by Jerry M. Gruitch.
'33), then in making the wood pattern, pouring the
casting, and finally in finishing the rough casting. The
men in the Metal Processing laboratory will not even
hazard a guess as to the amount of time which was
spent in turning, shaping and polishing to turn out
this fine piece of workmanship.
As most students are aware, there is a Tau Beta Pi
plaque in the West Engineering Building, which ex-
plains the purpose of the society and holds its ideals
before them. \"an .Wingen felt that there should be
something in the East Engineering Building for the
same purpose, and this is the result. The accompanying
photo shows the "bent" in place with its creator beside
it. Some idea of the size of the job can be had by
comparing it with the key which hangs from his watch
chain.
Needless to say both alumni and active members are
grateful to "Pete" for his fine job. It will stand as a
fitting symbol of the ideals of the society which
spurred him on to its accomplishment.

COLLEGES MUST COMBAT TUBERCULOSIS
Age-groups between 15 and 40 suffered the heaviest
losses from tuberculosis and accounted for more deaths
from this disease than from any other in 1933. the
Michigan Tuberculosis Association announced this
week from statistics compiled by the Michigan De-
partment of Health.
"Evidence aplenty that tuberculosis was flunking out
more college students than many a stiff academic sub-
ject was found in these figures and in the death investi-
gation carried on by the Michigan Tuberculosis Asso-
ciation this summer." declared Dr. Bruce H. Douglas,
president.
Dr. Douglas referred to the investigation of over
500 of the 1.031 deaths from tuberculosis among Mich-
igan young men and women under thirty years of age
during 1933. The survey financed by the annual sale
of tuberculosis Christmas seals, was made to determine
some of the contributing factors to the deaths of young
people from tuberculosis.
"This survey is not yet completed," Dr. Douglas
went on, "but it has gone far enough to prove that
among all contributing factors late diagnosis of the
disease stands out prominently."
The only answer to that problem,
he stated, is to increase the already
extensive use of the tuberculin test
and x-ray follow-up, as used in ex-
amining thousands annually in the
free Michigan Tuberculosis Asso-
ciation clinics.
These clinis are financed entirely
by the annual sale of tuberculosis
Christmas seals with the help of
contributing agencies. The seal sale
opened Thanksgiving Day, and will
continue until Christmas time.

Oxy-acetylene Welding Helps Stove Manufacturers and

J

Once, there were no other
means of fabricating metal prod-
ucts except through huge invest-
ments in patterns, dies and special
tool equipment. Naturally, it
was logical for the plant to re-

Capital investment had to be

Now, it is no longer necessary
to place this handicap on the

sumer demands.
Welding Lowers Cost of Stoves
Modern gas ranges, for ex-
ample, are assembled from a con-
siderable number of enameled
sheet steel panels of different
sizes. Former manufacturing
methods required a set of dies
for each panel. The total invest-
ment in dies for an ordinary stove
in many cases involved several

thousand dollars. With such a
large investment factories were
naturally reluctant to make any
change involving the scrapping
of dies until enough stoves of a
particular model had been manu-
factured to absorb their cost.
Many large gas range manu-
facturers now use welding in the
fabrication of stove panels and
eliminate the necessity for dies.
The sheet steel is cut to required
size on standard shears; the cor-
ners punched out on standard
machines; the edges turned up
on standard brakes and—the cor-
ners are welded.
Welding Is Modern
By adopting welding and cut-
ting these manufacturers have
largely eliminated factory resist-
ance to consumer change. This
flexible means of production
easily permits improvement in
current models, or redesign with-
out serious breaks in plant oper-
ation, or increased capital in-

The total cost of operation bv
the new method is not only lower
but it is now possible to follow

expensive equipment.
Used in Many Industries
The experience of the stove
manufacturer is duplicated in
many industries. Redesigning
metal products and equipment
for welded construction has re-
sulted in increased strength, util-
ity and permanence. It has been
adopted for metal furniture, loud
speakers, refrigerators, display
signs, sheet metal desks, stainless
steel barrels, hoes, truck bodies,
and numerous other articles.
Welding is applicable to the wid-
est range of materials—steel and
the ferrous alloys—aluminum,
brass, bronze, and practically all
other non-ferrous metals and
alloys. Welding is ideal for ap-
plications where smooth, invis-

ACTIVATED ALUMINA AND SOME METALLURGICAL
APPLICATIONS
CHARLES HARDY
Activated alumina is a partially dehydrated alumi-
num trihydrate which has a high porosity and a definite
physical structure. A handy and useful property it
possesses is that of absorbing water vapor, but it is
also capable of absorbing other gases; and it may be
used as a catalyst or catalyst carrier. There are of
course many other substances that absorb moisture,
but not as efficiently as activated alumina which will
take up from 12 to 14 per cent of its own weight at
100% absorptive efficiency. Another likable and con-
venient fact is that the alumina suffers no chemical
change in absorbing moisture hence there is no deteri-
oration, and after the alumina is reactivated it is as
good as ever, whereas most absorbents deteriorate be-
cause of chemical action.
The process by which alumina is reactivated and a
discussion of its application is also given in the article.
The facts are well presented and may be of interest
to metallurgists who are not yet acquainted with this
application of activated alumina.

FINDING WORK
—a review of new A.S.M.E. booklet
In the Semi-Annual Meeting of the A.S.M.E. at
Denver, Colo., in June, it was decided that the society
should print a pamphlet of the subject of finding work.
Samuel S. Board, a placement specialist in New York,
was secured to write this up. and it was printed not
only in pamphlet form, but also as an article in the
November issue of Mechanical Engineering.
The very name of the article is of interest to most
of us, and the article is no let-down. It explains in
very concise terms just how to go about selling your
services to an employer. It goes over each step in
detail, pointing out the mistakes that a man can make
and remedies for them.
The author ]&gt;oints out that it is necessary to think
of your ability as some product which you are selling,
and he applies selling technique to the search for a posi-
tion. The article is for engineers in all lines, and goes
into detail on the problems confronting an engineer.
It will be an invaluable aid to the young engineer just
starting out.
Besides the pertinent fact of how to find a job, the
article goes deeply into methods of how to choose
what job you want and how to successfully hold that
job and gain advancement.
In the last few paragraphs, Mr. Board sums up the
whole article for quick reference, and then prints a
table with squares to check after each step in the hunt-
ing of a job has been performed, so that the person
hunting for a job need never leave any step out.

OF ELECTRIC MOTORS
The bugbear for many students in Electrical Engi-
neering and for most students who are required to
take E. E. 2a will be entirely eliminated with regard
;o the subject of electric motors if one examines an
article in the November issue of Power Plant Engi-
neering. The article classifies all electric motors under
a relatively small group of fundamental types and
analyzes their characteristics and uses in condensed
form. A table of types of motors, classified as to
service, starting duty, speed, regulation, maximum
torque, and auxiliary information, will serve every
engineer with valuable data for his files.

stops to consider not only the vast quantities of ore
being removed annually, but also the great number of
industries—railroads, docks (many are devoted en-
tirely to ore loading), shipping, iron and steel com-
panies, and the ore mining industry itself—dependent
upon the existence of these deposits. There is also
an army of laborers who are vitally concerned as well
as a wealth of capital invested.
"The reserves of Superior iron ore will last but one
generation!" Since this is "an age of minerals" and
since "iron ore is industrial strength and self suffi-
ciency," this statement carries a startling revelation.
When these ore fields are unfruitful, our industrial
superiority must be retained either by processing ores
of low grade, or by importing ores (probably from
Brazil).
The article also presents a political aspect to the
question, and then follow statistics about reclaiming

As a closing consolation the author suggests that it
does not pay to delve too far into the future.

The first chemical used in warfare was chlorine gas
in the form of a cloud turned loose by the Germans
upon the Allies in April, 1915. From this beginning
the use of chemicals developed by leaps and bounds
because the many possibilities of chemicals were un-
known. This new weapon produced psychological
effects more valuable than the casualties of battle.
Major Brockman classifies the chemicals into four
groups. These are tear gases; toxic smokes; persistent
toxic gases, of which mustard gas is an example; and
non-persistent gases, of which phosgene and chlorpirin
are examples. Of these four groups, only the last
contains deadly gases.
This article also contains reliable statistics showing
the amount and effect of the different gases used dur-
ing the late war and the amounts necessary to produce
fatalities.
In conclusion. Major Brockman outlines the uses of
chemicals in both attack and defense maneuvers and
the part played by the airplane in chemical warfare.
He predicts that military tactics will have to be modi-
fied in order to give due consideration to this new
weapon—chemical warfare.
THE COVER
The cover shows the operation of filling ingot molds
from the master ladle, in a steel plant. From here the
cars are taken outdoors, the molds stripped off, the
ingots "soaked" in pits where a uniform heat is
acquired throughout the metal, and then the process of
rolling begun.

Apparatus for producing and measuring one centimeter waves, the shortest continuous
electromagnetic waves ever produced.
Optical methods were used in studying these waves and the research problem that led to the attempt to produce
them was an optical problem. It had been predicted that ammonia gas should absorb waves of 1.5 cm length much
as other gases absorb long light radiation. This absorption was found as predicted thus justifying the physicist's
faith in his theoretical work and bridging the gap between radio waves and light waves.
The tube is between the poles of the magnet. The rays were reflected across the room by the large concave
mirror to the grating shown in the other picture. From the grating they were rctlected to the second mirror and
focused on the receiver.
The gas was placed in a rubber bag suspended from the ceiling and lowered by a rope into the path of the ray.

TALKING TOWER
Tlic highest self-supporting tower in the United
Stales used as an aerial is now in operation at
General Eleetrie's radio station KOA at Denver.
The tower, standing 470 feet high, is a departure
from the customary type of radio antenna, where
copper wires arc stretched in "clothesline" fashion
between two lowers. It will act as a vertical radiator
of radio waves.
With the "clothesline" antenna, a large part of the
electric energy released flows directly upward and
is lost in space, whereas with the new type of
radiator at KOA, a larger quantity of llie broadcast
waves radiate parallel to the earth's surface.
Slender compared with others of its kind, the lower
is but 35 feet square at the base and tapers to two
feel square al the lop. It will withstand a wind of
125 miles an hour, and its 50-ton weight is carried
by four huge porcelain '"eggs," which insulate it
from the ground.
The new antenna was installed this summer in
connection with a new 50,000-walt General Electric
radio transmitter.
RECORD-BREAKING BREAKERS
The 287,500-voll transmission lines from Boulder
Dam to Los Angeles will be protected by eight
General Electric super-speed impulse oil circuit
breakers—having higher ratings than any other
circuit breakers so far developed. In appearance, the
breakers are completely different from previous
breakers. They resemble great "E's" lying on their
faces. They will be used al a higher voltage than
any other breaker. They are rated to interrupt the
circuit in slightly more than one-third the time
required by previous high-voltage breakers. The
most startling fact about the breakers, however, is
that the complete units will weigh less than the oil
which would be required by a unit of conventional
design.
The impulse type of breaker, in which a piston
drives streams of oil into the arc paths when the
contacts separate, was developed by General Electric
engineers at first for electric railway service, where
it has proved highly successful.
COFFIN FELLOWSHIPS
Eight technical graduate students resumed their
studies this year with the reassuring thought that
a good part of their expenses will be taken care of by
fellowships granted them by the Charles A. Coffin
Foundation, which was established by General
Electric in honor of its first president.
The fellowships were granted to: Russell Charles
Buehl, Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute, '32, M. S.
at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, to study
at M.I.T.; Milton G. While, U. of California, '31, to
continue study there; Bascom Henry Caldwell, Jr.,
U. of Texas, '30, to study at Yale; Thomas Benjamin
Jones, Johns Hopkins, '33, to continue study there;
Sidney Kaufman, Cornell, '30, to continue study
there; Leonard Trainer Pockman, Stanford, '33, to
continue study there; Arnold Byron Steiner, Stan-
ford, '33, to continue study there; and Clark C.
Stephenson, U. of Kansas, '32, to study at the
U. of California. All the fellowship winners are carry-
ing on investigations in electrical phenomena; two
are specializing in high-voltage research.
In addition to these fellowships, the Charles A.
Coffin Foundation annually grants awards for the
highest achievements in the utilities and electric rail-
way fields, and honors G-E employees who have
made outstanding contributions to the progress of
the Company and the industry.

FROM BASIC MATERIALS TO FINISHED PRODUCT
The fact that Dow manufactures most of the raw materials
used in the production of its more than 250 chemical
products insures maximum control of quality and mainte-
nance of standards.
The flow chart below shows the various steps in the pro-
duction of Dow Phenol and serves to illustrate the above
statement. The basic raw materials are brine pumped from
deep wells and benzol. Several preliminary products are
made before Phenol is finally produced. This affords
numerous opportunities to eliminate impurities which are
objectionable in the final product. Evidence that this
actually occurs can be found in the fact that Dow Phenol
has a congealing point of over 40° C.
The control of raw materials through basic manufacturing
processes is equally important in the manufacture of other
Dow products which have such high standing in the
markets of the world.
Just as Dow Phenol, U.S.P., is manufactured by an original
Dow process in the world's largest and most modern synthetic
Phenol plant, so are other Dow products manufactured by
original processes from carefully controlled raw materials.
Let us quote on your requirements.

GEORGE A. DANKERS, JR., '35E
A Tau Beta Pi Initiation Paper
Water transportation is almost as old as man. From
time immemorial. Ixsats or ships of some fashion have
heen used by him on the water areas which cover some
four-fifths of the globe. From the time when it was
desired to send boats in directions other than those
which the currents of rivers would carry them, some
means of propulsion has been needed. Poles and crude
oars were first used, power being supplied from the
strong backs of the boatmen. Following from this be-
ginning, the methods of ship propulsion have evolved
from crude and feeble ways to powerful systems we
have today.
Before discussing the various methods of ship pro-
pulsion. I would like to touch briefly on the underlying
principles. In those systems which embody the use
of screws, jets, oars, or paddle wheels, the apparatus
used acts on the water. The action on the water is
so arranged as to give a sternward acceleration to a cer-
tain portion of it at succeeding intervals of time. The
product of this sternward acceleration and the mass of
the water moved, equals the force of thrust on the ship
in a forward direction. Ship propulsion by sail is ac-
complished by erecting a barrier to the wind and using
some component of the wind force on the sail to drive
the vessel. Some few ships, especially those of the
canal type, are propelled by towing. This method is
the most positive and quite understandable.
Some of the first water craft to be used to carry
cargoes were the rafts on the Nile river. These flat,
crude affairs, made by lashing several logs together,
were employed in transporting stone blocks for build-
ing purposes. Propulsion was by pole and oar. Larger
vessels of hollow construction followed, and sails were
added to help the oars. War galleys of early date were
pushed by long sweeps manned by captured enemies.
It is also on record that some of these naval craft were
propelled by oxen-operated paddle wheels.
Human paddle craft rapidly disappeared as hull
forms improved and sail rig was better understood,
until, through the period of the galleon we came to
that of the clipper ship. The propulsion during this
period was from square sails, rigged four and five high
on three or more masts.
The year 1788 saw one of the first steam powered
vessels in operation on the lake at Dalswinton. Fng-
land. It was a paddle wheel type and attained the
speed of five miles per hour. It was succeeded by
many more like craft including America's ''Clermont."
The first screw driven vessel was invented in 1838.
It was an iron ship constructed in Britain for Captain
Robert Stockton of the American Navy. The screw
propelled vessel has developed to such a fine degree
since that time that today the greater portion of ships
are so driven. Stern and side wheel paddles are the
only other types of propulsion which are used to any
great extent, and their advantages lie in shallow water
use such as is found in river, lake, and bay transport.
Paddle wheels are not satisfactory where seas are
rough, the vessel being subject to pitching and rolling.
The power for paddle boats is usually furnished by
inclined or vertical reciprocating steam engines.
The screw profiler is a wheel with two or more
blades, the driving faces of which are either ]K&gt;rtions
of helicoidal surfaces, or close approaches to being
such. A helicoidal surface is one generated by a line
inclined to an axis, revolving about the axis at a uni-
form angular rate, and also advancing parallel to the
axis at a uniform linear rate. The pitch of a helicoidal
surface or a propeller is the distance advanced during
one complete revolution. Propellers do not in practice
move through the water as through a solid nut. They
advance a distance less than their pitch for each revo-
lution. Under given conditions of operation the dis-
tance advanced is the same for each revolution. The
propeller is located at the stern of the hull where it
can operate in the wake water which follows, and its
shaft is horizontal. In large ships where the required
horsepower could not be handled by any comparable
propeller, two, three, or four are used, separate engines

narily employed for driving the screw propeller is of

cating machines are steam multiple expansion engines.
over twice the total tonnage to date using them over all
other types of power put together. About one-sixth of
total tonnage is registered as internal combustion en-
gines, which includes gasoline and Diesel. Geared steam
turbine and turbo-electric drives compose the remain-
der or about one-seventh of total tonnage.
Jet propulsion lias never been used except experi-
mentally. In jet propulsion water is taken into a ship.
where it passes through some form of a pump or im-
pelling apparatus, and then delivered astern through
suitable pipes. Many schemes for jet propulsion have-
been brought forward in the past, usually including
methods for diverting the jets sidewise as desired, in
order to gain maneuvering jxwer. While some schemes
of jet propulsion have been actually tried, none has
proved so efficient as the screw propeller or paddle
wheel.
Our problems of propulsion are by no means solved.
Research in the study of improvement of ship form
and propeller design are continually going on. and

As You Like It
F. WILLIAM DONOVAN, '37E
After getting into a more or less technical discussion
of how indoor hockey rinks are made, we decided to
get some first hand information and forthwith betook
ourselves down to the coliseum.
Since statistics show that the vast majority of the
students on the campus either do not know how to
skate or do not know that the University has one of
the best skating rinks in the country, it might be well
to inform those unknowing ones that on the corner of
Hill and South Fifth avenue there is a gray concrete
building in which there is a sheet of ice some sixteen
thousand square feet in area. Upon producing rela-
tively few shekels, the would-be skater may have the
use of the whole sixteen thousand square feet in which
to display his ability to remain top end skymost when
the feet have a pair of skates attached—or vice versa.
On week days the rink is open from two-thirty to five
in the afternoon and from eight to ten in the evening.
It is also open from three to five on Sundays.
And now, having located the ice for the benefit of
those who might not have known of its existence, we
can get on to what we found out about the inner work-
ings.
Kcldie Lowrey, hockey coach and general manager
of the coliseum, turned us over to Herman Stone, who
is the chief engineer of the plant. Herman led us to
the back of the building into the engine room where
he showed us around and explained how things worked.
Incidentally, if you are able to inveigle Herman into
showing you the engine room, it alone will be worth
the trip down there.
Two fifty-ton ammonia compressors, each powered
by a seventy horsepower electric motor, are mounted
in the center of the floor. Two large tanks along the
right hand wall hold the fifteen hundred pounds of
ammonia necessary to charge the system.
The gaseous ammonia is compressed by the compres-
sors, the temperature rising in the process. It is then
run outside and down through cooling tanks. A sepa-
rate water system runs water from an outdoor vat up
into coolers at the top of the building where the water
is cooled by air and run down through the ammonia
coolers. The compressed ammonia is run through small
pipes in the coolers, and the cold water against these
pi]&gt;es condenses the ammonia gas to a liquid.
Freeze-ups in the water coolers, during very cold
spells, appeared to be a decided possibility. However,
it seems that the compressed ammonia is hot enough
so that by the time the water has absorbed the heat it
is far too hot to freeze during the trip through the
cooling towers.
The cooled liquid ammonia is then run through an
expansion valve into pipes which are in the brine tank.
The ammonia, on vaporizing absorbs considerable heat
and cools the brine. The brine is held at twenty to
twenty-five degrees Fahrenheit.
Two fifteen horsejxnver motors, each capable of
moving six hundred gallons of brine per minute, pump
the freezing solution through the pipes in the rink.
Slightly less than ten miles of one and one-quarter
inch pipe are laid on the sand foundation. This sand
is saturated and frozen and then the ice is built up

whitewash is then applied. This hides the pipes and
gives the ice a much whiter appearance than it would
ordinarily have. The layers of ice are then built up
to the thickness necessary for use.
We hated to admit it, but we didn't know how the
red lines were put on the rink. Almost invariably when
the subject of hockey is brought up, someone asks how
the lines get on the ice. Herman blew up all the fancy
ideas we'd had for making these markers when he told
us that he paints them on with a regular old-fashioned
jiaint brush, using a couple of boards for guides. This
is done before every game and a layer or two of ice is
frozen over to protect the coloring from the players'
skates.
The ice is flooded after every skating session, and
oddly enough, hot water is used. The hot water melts
any snow that is left after the ice is cleaned and knits
in with the old ice, thus preventing excess chipping.
However it does not give a smooth glassy surface when
frozen, so before the hockey games, cold water is used
after the hot as it gives a smoother finish.
That the ice at the coliseum is of the best is evinced
An inviting expanse of ice—the University Coliseum
by the fact that visiting hockey teams and figure skaters
are always enthusiastic alnnit the condition of the rink.
It is well taken care of. and better ones—there are none.
It might be a good idea, now that the football season
is over, to get out the skates and make a trip or two
down to the coliseum. Even if it is just to see if you
can keep the ice from coming up and hitting you too
often. We couldn't. The score was three to nothing
in favor of the ice.

PLANS TO REDUCE COLLISION DAMAGE
At present double bottoms are being used on ships
for the purpose of minimizing risks of grounding on
shoals, however Mr. Edward F. Spanner, noted firitish
naval architect who recently attended the convention of
the Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers,
points out that on the large ocean liners the dangers of
collision are of more frequent occurrence and serious
character than those of grounding. Hence, Mr. Span-
ner concludes, the double false bottoms of ocean liners
might well be removed and placed so as to offer pro-
tection to the sides of the vessels which are now ex-
posed to ramming impacts. The space between the
two "skins" would be used for the storage of water
ballast or fuel.
By means of collapsible bow the ramming vessel
rather than the ship which is struck would absorb most
of the shock of collision. Such a bow involves the
replacement of the ordinary rigid, sharp-cutting stem
bar with a collision bulkhead about 10 feet from the
bow, in front of which are a number of transverse
plates, spaced several inches apart, and decreasing in
size from the bulkhead to the bow. When a collision
occurs each plate section beginning at the bow would
collapse in turn, and as each plate became involved the
area absorbing the pressure would increase, thereby re-
ducing the pressure on each square inch of section.
o
RUST IS LOSINC ITS HOLD
Rapid progress is being made by metallurgists in cut-
ting down the estimated $3,000,000,000 annual rust
loss. .Although the rust tax evidently will never be
completely eliminated, the losses from oxidation are to
be reduced considerably through the more extensive
use of stainless steels, toucan iron and many other
newly developed rust-resisting alloys. The U. S. Navy
is perhaps the foremost consumer of corrosive resistant
metals, utilizing them in great quantities in the con-
struction of its battleships and seaplanes.

A fortune is waiting for the chemical engineer who
can devise a process by which oil can be economically
released from the vast shale deposits of the west. It
is estimated that the oil-soaked layers of shale-clay in
the western reserves contain more than 100.000.000.-
000 barrels of oil.

The new Bailey Orifice
PERFECT NEW ORIFICE
A new type of adjustable orifice, developed by the
Bailey Meter Company, now makes possible the testing
of airplane carburetors on the ground under exactly
the same conditions as are encountered in actual serv-
ice. Two of these devices have been furnished to the
United States Navy for testing purposes. The Bailey
Adjustable Orifice may be set to measure accurately
a wide range of flow of air varying in temperature from
minus 60° F. to plus 200° F., and in pressures from
27 to 37 inches of mercury. Its maximum capacity is
450 pounds of air per minute at 200° F. and it will
measure with equal accuracy a minimum capacity of 20
pounds of air per minute at minus 60c F. Because
of the wide range of conditions to which it is subjected,
the gate segment is made of Monel Metal, which re-
tains its physical strength under these varying condi-
tions and at the same time offers a high resistance to
corrosion, abrasion, and erosion.
By a micrometer screw arrangement the height of
the gate may be set to within .001 inches. When
changed conditions require readjustments in the capac-
ity of the orifice, it is only necessary to set the micro-
meter screw at the reading corresponding to the desired
capacity as obtained from curve sheets furnished with
the orifice. By this method a range changing adjust-
ment at the meter proper or a by-pass line at the pri-
mary element is avoided.
o
A NEW MECHANICAL BRAIN
No longer need the engineer spend long, tedious
hours in search for the solution to a set of simultan-
eous equations—that is. if Dr. John B. Wilbur and Dr.
Vennevar Bush, of Massachusetts Institute of Tech-
nology, will be kind enough to loan him the new me-
chanical "brain" which they have just constructed. All
that is necessary to obtain the solution to a set of equa-
tions is to adjust a number of scales corresponding to
the values in the equations and to set the machine in
operation. In due course of time the answer appears
as the readings on a set of angular verniers. It all
sounds rather simple, but an idea of the intricacy of
the device may be obtained by a consideration of the
parts required for the construction of a second pro-
posed model. Almost 1,000 ball-bearing pulleys, more
than 500 feet of steel tape, and 110 vernier scales will
be needed. The machine itself will be only 2 feet wide.
2l/2 feet high, and 7 feet long. Two examples of the
types of problems which this remarkable device will
be called upon to solve are those regarding the design
of complicated structures such as tall buildings which
must resist the forces of wind and the shock of earth-
quake, and those of the adjustment of triangulation
networks which form a horizontal control for precise
surveys.
SOVIET AGRICULTURE
Whatever may be said in regard to the technological
aspects of Russia's extensive industrial program, the
art of agriculture is not suffering from inattention in
the land of the Soviets. Even the great sand dunes in
the desert of Kara Kum, east of the Caspian sea and
north of the Persian border, have been regimented into
production. Russian scientists, discovering that the
dunes serve as condensers of atmospheric moisture, so
that they hold a supply of water only a short distance
beneath the surface which is sufficient to support plant
life, have attacked the problem of preventing the fur-
ther shifting of the sands. Large quantities of saksaul.
a plant with long, tenacious roots, have been planted
on the dunes. Experiments have shown that, with the
use of fertilizer, rye, wheat, barley, and fodder crops
can be raised without irrigation. Tests are also being
made to determine the possibility of raising grapes,
melons, and fruit trees on this soil.
Another interesting development is the method used
by Soviet farmers to speed up the ripening of their
cotton crops. They do it with, powdered coal, and they
don't go to all the expense and bother of constructing
heating plants and hot-houses. They simply spread
the dust over their fields, using about 100 pounds to
the acre, and let the laws of physics do the rest. The
dark coal dust absorbs the heat of the sun during the
day and reradiates it in the night. The higher average
temperature has the effect of shortening the season, and
the time saved is usually more than a month. o

For Engineers
PROFESSOR C. T. OLMSTED
Secretary, State Board of Examiners
Most laymen know that before a graduate of a med-
ical school or of a law school can begin the practice of
his profession he must pass a comprehensive examina-
tion and receive a certificate from his state authorizing
him to practice. Very few laymen and, in fact, very
few engineering students, know that in at least half of
our states the prospective professional engineer must
qualify in a like manner before he may hang out his
shingle. Fifteen years ago, except in one or two states,
anyone who had the temerity to have a sign printed
could open an office and engage in the practice of eng'-
neering with as little formality as if he were opening
a store. He was not required to qualify in any manner
whatsoever, and there was noth-
ing to prevent him from attempt-
ing any engineering assignment
for which he could persuade a
client to engage him.
In the past fifteen years, with
a very few exceptions, all the
most populous of our states have
passed laws regulating the prac-
tice of engineering, architecture
and surveying. The laws differ
considerably in their details but
each of them provides for a
board of examiners whose duty
it is to examine applicants and to
certify them as being qualified to practice. The meth-
ods of examining candidates differ widely in the var-
ious states. Some states submit them to a rigorous
written examination of four days' duration, wlv'le a
few examine their applicants more or less perfunc-
torily by oral examinations. However, the two Na-
tional Councils, to which most of the various state
engineering and architectural boards belong and
through which reciprocal registration between states
is effected, recommend that all boards adopt a more
or less uniform type of written examination.
Michigan passed a law requiring the registration of
architects in 1915 and four years later another law
was passed which included engineers and surveyors.
All candidates, except those who are exempt by reason
of the fact that they were already pract'cing in these
professions when the laws went into effect, are required
to qualify by means of a written examination. The
Professor Olmsted here points
out 3 few fundamental facts
about registration and certifica-
tion of the engineer by the state,
and in a later article will give
more specific information about
ihc examinations.
The Editor.
architectural and engineering examinations are of three
days' duration and the surveying examination two days.
These examinations are given at various places through-
out the state, including the University of Michigan,
in June and December of each year. In order to be
eligible for registration, an applicant must have a
minimum of six years' practical experience in his par-
ticular field or he must be a graduate of a technical
college of approved standing and have a minimum of
two years practical exj&gt;erience.
.Although a candidate cannot be registered until he
has fulfilled the experience requirement, the Michigan
Board allows seniors, who are about to graduate, to
write the first two days of the
examination and finish the re-
mainder after two or more years
of practical exj&gt;erience. The ex-
amination is arranged so as to
make this possible, as the first
two days are devoted to technical
subjects which the student has
studied in his tour-year course
ami the third day the candidate
is examined in the particular
branch of engineering in which
he has received his practical ex-
perience. While it is true that
the majority of graduates in en-
gineering may never need a registration certificate, one
never knows when a situation may arise which would
make it extremely desirable, if not absolutely necessary,
for him to be registered. It is therefore an excellent
idea for seniors to take advantage of this opjxjrtunity
to get most of the examination out of the way when
they can best afford the time and when they are pre-
sumably best prepared.
It has not been the puqxjse of this article to present
arguments in favor of the idea of registration. No
doubt there are many des'rable features connected with
it. and numerous prominent engineers have opposed it.
However, the majority are apparently in favor of it,
for nearly every year another state is added to the list
and in all cases the local engineering and architectural
societies are back of the movement
Registration seems here to stay and no doubt will
soon be universal throughout the nation: it is up to
January, 1935

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


If engineers compel outside interests to sponsor legis-
lation regarding their registration, the results are sure
to be far less satisfactory than if the engineers them-
selves had taken the initiative. Consequently, it is
strongly to be recommended that all engineers who can
qualify become registered, not only for their own ad-
vantage but for the good of the profession as well. The
medical and legal professions have been able to raise
their standards and their reputations greatly by means
of practically universal and compulsory registration,
and engineers should be able to do likewise.

Research Solves
Practical Problems
H. B. VINCENT
Research Physicist, Dcpt. of Engineering Research
Industry is to a greater and greater extent attempt-
ing to improve the uniformity of quality of manufac-
tured products and finds that one very essential element
in the accomplishment of this is the development of
better instruments for inspection purposes. So often
it is necessary to destroy or disfigure an article in
order to determine certain of its qualities that manu-
facturers are always searching for instruments which
will obviate this waste. One of the types of work
which the Department of Engineering Research is
called upon to do is the development of such instru-
ments. In this same connection the Department is often
called upon to check the feasibility of new methods
proposed for inspection purposes.
A large manufacturer of roller bearings had sug-
gested to it a method for testing bearing races for soft
spots. This method consisted of setting up mechanical
or sound vibrations within the races at their natural
frequencies of vibration and measuring these frequen-
cies, the claim being made that the presence of a soft
region in the race would so alter the natural or reso-
nance frequency of vibration that parts having such
soft spots could be readily detected through the use of
this phenomenon,
To test the practicability of the theory, twelve races
Surveyors in rear of Library
with production tolerances of one one-thousandth of an
inch or less and which were known to be hardened were
chosen. These were sus]&gt;etided one at a time by cords
between two magnet systems in such a manner that
they were free to vibrate. One of the magnet systems
had its coil connected to a vacuum tube oscillator. As
the frequency of alternation of the current supplied to
the magnet coil by the oscillator reached the resonance
frequency of the races they began to vibrate vigorously.
This vibration caused a flux change in the second mag-
net system, which was connected to a vacuum tube
voltmeter so as to give a maximum reading for the
resonance condition. The frequency was measured by
a frequency analyzer which operates in much the same
manner as the tuning mechanism of a radio receiver.
The tests showed a variation of resonance frequen-
cies for the twelve races of 1.2 per cent whereas one
of the rings were softened for one-quarter of its cir-
cumference showed an increase in frequency of only
0.46 per cent and another softened for one-third of its
circumference an increase of 0.52 per cent. These re-
sults show that the particular application proposed was
not feasible. An analysis of the races showed that
they had a soft core, the surface being carburized and
hardened, so that the variation between races could be
attributed to non-uniformity of case hardening. The
method might, however, be workable on homogeneous
parts. In any case, it illustrates one of the many prin-
ciples of physics which the engineer is attempting to
use in solving industrial development problems where
scientists familiar with the underlying principles of the
phenomenon can check the practicability for definite
applications more readily and at less expense than can
be clone in industry generally.

Moose, became one of the illustrious
University of Michigan students
even in his freshman year by his
nomination to the A. I. Ch. E. so-

Sigma. In his sophomore year he
made preparations for his junior
year, when he took over the posi-
tion of Accounts Manager of the
Michigan Daily. He was elected to
Triangles and to Tau Beta Pi in
recognition of his character and
scholastic average. At present he is
serving on the Judiciary Committee
of the Undergraduate Council of the
University of Michigan. To top off
his college career he lias been elected
to Vulcans and to Phi Kappa Phi,
is President of the Engineering

points above his nearest competitor
during Orientation Week, for which
he received an intramural award.
Time elapsed and the burning desire
to wrestle came to the fore during
his sophomore year when he sacri-
ficed his physique to the betterment
of the wrestling team. At this time
he also served as a member of the

his sophomore year, made Triangles
last spring and has just become a
member of Tau Beta Pi, one of the
juniors so honored.
He manages to take twenty hours
each semester with honor even
though he works his way through
school, not only by manual labor but
also by playing a saxophone, at
which he is quite adept. His address

ingly admits his favorite hobby is
building and playing with small gas
engines. Of equal ini]&gt;ortance to
him are certain ty|&gt;es of athletics,
including golf and football. It is
chiefly through these interests that
he was nominated and elected, al-
though his captaincy of the "Sophs"
in the glass games helped considera-
bly. Don considers financial economy
as the chief problem for the class of

Class of 1938
The eastern portion of the coun-
try came through in a pinch to send
us our freshman class president.
Hubert C. Fones hails from East
Aurora, N.Y., near Buffalo. A lead-
er in High School, he was class
vice-president during his junior and
senior years. He won three letters
in football, and two each in basket-
ball, baseball and golf, besides being
a member of the National Honor
Society. He has tentatively chosen
Mechanical Engineering as his field
of endeavor. The popularity of this
quiet, unassuming eighteen-year-o'd
athlete was such that his election
was simply a matter of form. After
earning his freshman numerals in
football, his interest has turned with
the season to hockey. His past suc-
cesses predict greater accomplish-
ments in the future.

In the January, 1935 issue of The
American Magazine appeared this
editorial by Dr. R. A. Millikan,
world-famous physicist and winner of
the Nobel Prize for distinguished
scientific discoveries. We'll let it
speak for itself:
Growth
IT is time to strike the total of last
year's achievements so that we may
know how far we have gone. Those
who measure progress by years and
miles and dollars will tell us how many
passenger and freight miles were
flown by airplanes in 1934, how many
hours were consumed in broadcasting
programs from how many radio sta-
tions, the number of new buildings
erected, the statistics of factory and
farm production . . . but if we are
to measure our progress for the year,
let us have a lull measure.
It is very well to fly, but who flew,
and what did he seek? An airplane or
a swift train is mearly a means of
going from one place to another. It
can convey a stupid man, a careless,
thoughtless man, a cruel man. How
many such men and women flew in
1934? How many persons walked
alone in silence a little while each day,
in sun or starlight or rain, thoughtful,
tranquil, and free?
We are interested, of course, in
the development of communication.
But what was communicated? Tele-
phones, transatlantic cables, and
radio stations are merely means of
carrying symbols from one place to
another. Symbols of what? Of cu-
pidity, hate, half-formed ideas? Or
symbols of generosity, understanding,
of sound, objective thinking, untinged
by prejudice or malice or fear?
What did we communicate in 1934?
If we are to measure progress for the
year, let us first measure ourselves.
How many telephone calls did we
make last year? Who cares? The im-
portant thing is what we said. Did
we speak less brusquely and less in-
anely than we did the year before?
\Vere we less impatient, more tol-
erant? How many times did we say,
"Perhaps T am wrong. I think we
can reason this out and come to an
understanding"? How many for-
gotten friends did we call and how
often did we say, "I heard you had
had some hard luck and I wanted to
know whether I could help"?
IT IS not important how many miles
we traveled in our motorcars last
year. It is important how many
times we yielded a crossing to a
stranger, not through timidity but
through a recognition of the rights
of others, How many persons, who
would otherwise have had to walk
or stay at home, did we take for a ride?
How many times did we drive alone
to a hilltop to read and to meditate,
hungering for betterment?
There are those who will scan the
building statistics of the dead year and
say, "Things are not so bright, are
they?" They will sit in the build-
ings we constructed in 1929 and
gloomily shake th?ir heads. They
have not progressed. I am not par-
ticularly interested in new buildings,
unless they provide more air and sun-
light and opportunity for the people
who work in them. I am interested in
what goes on in buildings. So many
of the great of the earth have labored
in basements and attics and hovels.
The statistics of farm and factory
production for 1934 are important.
But what did we produce—you and
I? How much did we grow in mental
and moral fiber?
TELL me how fast the wheels
turned in 1934, and I will ask how
slow and firm were the feet of
thoughtful men upon the earth. Tell
me how much we improved the oil-
burning engine, and I will ask how
nnich we improved the motor of men
—'he knowledge, the understanding,
the purpose. A few men went up to the
stratosphere in 1934. But what of us?
In 1935, perhaps, if we are thought-
ful and honest and kind and coura-
geous, we may ascend a little way
toward our own stratosphere — the
mysterious altitudes of ourselves.

OPEN HOUSE PLANNED
John Schmidt, '35E, president of
the A.S.M.E. Mechanicals, is stir-
ring things up these days for a real
old-fashioned Engineering Open
House.
Not so many years ago. the En-
gineering College was wont to stage
a real show for the people of Michi-
gan. The whole school was thrown
open, from cellar to garret (or
should we say "from naval tank to
drawing rooms"?). The various de-
partments cooperated to the extent
of putting on exhibitions of tests
and equipment.
Johnny would like to do the same
thing this year. Plans are to have
the affair on Friday, Saturday and
Sunday of Spring Homecoming,
with perhaps an Engineer's Ban-
quet on one of the evenings.
Those students who have been
approached are all in favor of it.
Vulcans. Senior Honorary society,
has expressed itself willing to lend
a hand in every way. Let's have
more comment.
Talk things up among yourselves,
and we'll give you more informa-
tion later!

STRESSES
and
THE NEW "DROOP"
A good many of us are seniors now. and it won't he
so long until we're sent out in the cruel world. Yeah.'
Anyway it is a good idea to know what goes on in the
engineering field. We present herewith the modern
method of attack in producing a new automobile:
After a lengthy session of the Board of Directors,
the President of the Droop Motor Corporation has
issued an ultimatum to the Engineering department
that 10,000 of next year's model are to be ready for
delivery in two months, and are to be modernized to
the last minute, to exemplify progress to the minutest
detail.
Chief Engineer sends back reply stating that entire
staff is on its toes, and is ready to bring forth a cre-
ation of the last minute design, embodying new fea-
tures throughout. Chief Engineer then calls in
assistant and wants to know if he has heard of any
new ideas. Assistant shakes head, but says it is
rumored that Ford is bringing out an X12 motor with
2 inch cylinders. C. E. jots down note saying that new
Droop will have X16 motor with 1.5 inch cylinders.
Assistant points out that $500,000 worth of machinery
will have to be junked. C. E. asks who is designing
car anyway. Asks if any more rumors are current.
Assistant says his sister-in-law heard that Chrysler is
bringing out knee action in all four wheels. This gives
C. E. an idea to bring out an exclusive feature of his
own. Announces exultantly that new Droop will have
4 wheel drive, pointing out advantages of greater trac-
tion, equal tire wear, etc.. in note to President who
sends back note stressing the importance of stream-
lining.
Chief Engineer starts design of car. Discovers that
4 wheel drive involves transmission difficulties, and is
forced to mount engine 10 inches higher. Discovers
that this raises center of gravity too high, and lowers
body to within 6 inches of ground to compensate. This
brings transmission housing 8 inches above floorboard.
Assistant asks where middle passenger is to put legs.
C. E. gives him stern look and has front seat replaced
with individual seats. Chief Salesman wants to know
what's the big idea. C. E. tries to describe in technical
terms why three in one seat reduces safety and com-
fort. Salesman mutters something about engineers and
STEAINS
farmers, and leaves.
1000 new bodies suddenly arrive. Chief Engineer
looks at them and wants to know what they are. De-
signer proudly says they follow the latest European
trend, and closely resemble the new Spaghetti-Martini.
C. E. shakes head ruefully and tries them on chassis.
Bodies are 2 feet too long, and hood hits overhead
valves. C. E. considers possibility of refusing 1000
bodies, and then sadly redesigns engine for side valves,
and lengthens chassis.
President suddenly sends note saying that General
Motors will incorporate air conditioning in all new
models, orders C. E. to get busy on one for Droop, and
says that it will be chief selling feature of new model.
C. E. becomes still sadder as he observes how engine
completely fills new streamlined hood. Finally decides
to use one of engine cylinders as compression pump
for air conditioning unit, and places cooling radiator
on rear of car to serve also as luggage rack.
Chief Engineer announces design is complete. Plant
superintendent immediately assembles all employees
and gives pep talk stressing the need of cooperation
and speed so that the new Droop may go to market on
scheduled time. Curses all slackers. Curse words
happen to mean "end of meeting" in Polish. Assem-
blage immediately gets up and leaves. Plant Superin-
tendent senses labor trouble and calls Police. Police
visualize bunch of tough factory workers and call
Militia. Militia enlists aid of Army. Matter comes
to attention of N.R.A. board. N.R.A. says that em-
ployees' wages must be increased. President tells C. E.
to cut down cost of Droop to compensate. C. E. says
can't be done. President forced to cut down some-
where to meet expenditures. Considers salary of vice-
presidents and himself. Decides to reduce salary of
Engineering staff. C. E. quits and gets job in plant.
Immediately makes enough to buy a new Droop. Buys
new Ford instead.
"Yassah," said old Link, "business very good. Done
bought a pig fo' $10, traded pig fo' a barrer, barrer fo'
a calf, calf fo' a bicycle, and sol' de bicycle for $10!"
"But yo' don' make nothin' Link."
"Sho' 'nough, but look at de business Ah been doin'."

campus life of today's student.
H. A. Sutin followed this with a
description of the Michigan Technic

PROFESSOR WHITE WRITES
ABOUT ALUMNI
Writing in the January. 1935 is-
sue of the American Gas Association
Monthly. Prof. A. H. W hite has an
interesting article entitled "Michi-
gan's Gas Engineering Fellowship
and Its Influence on the Second
Generation."
In the article he points out that
Sherman Russell. '98E, the first
holder of the fellowship, was fol-
lowed by his son, Edwin, '331'-. for-
mer varsity track captain and now
cadet engineer with the Consoli-
dated Gas Co. of Xew York. Wil-
lard Hall. '35E, who held the
fellowship last year is but follow-
ing in the footsteps of his father.
Samuel Ball. '03. who was the
fourth holder of the fellowship.
The article goes on to discuss the
success which has attended the fel-
lowship holders and the effect which
they have had on the gas industry.
Of the thirty-four holders, one is
dead, one has retired after twenty-
five years in the industry, one never
made any direct use of his profes-
sional knowledge, the other thirty-
one are all in contact with engineer-
ing projects, and twenty-five of
them have had major contacts with
the gas industry.
Prof. White ends by comparing
the fellowship to a catalyst, in that
it promotes research and is itself
never used up.
THE ROLLICKING "ROAST"
A new note in student-faculty re-
lations was struck with the success
of the A.S.M.E.. Aero and Mechan-
ical's "Roast" on December nine-
teenth at the Michigan Union.
One hundred and thirty-three
professors and students sat down to
an enjoyable meal and when it was
finished, hurled "bouquets" back
and forth at an astounding rate.
Prof. H. E. Keeler. the "roast-
master" had all he could do to keep
the peace.
The climax of the evening came
when the cup, here pictured, was
awarded to "The Man Who Can
Take It." The preliminary elimi-
nation brought the field down to
two, and in the final selection it was
given to John Grennan, our friend
of the foundry, over Prof. Charles
Good. We understand that the cup
is proudly displayed on Mr. Gren-
nan's desk at present.
The "Roast" will be an annual
affair from now on and the cup
will be awarded every year.

New Metals Emphasize
Desirability of Jointless Design
Welding Preferred Method for Fabricating
Jointless Designs from New Materials
By H. E. Rockefeller*
Welding is an important aid in
securing the full benefit of the
newer light weight alloys, corro-
sion- and stain-resistant steels
and other ferrous and non-ferrous
metals. Jointless welded designs
in these new metals make the
finished product attractive in ap-
pearance, efficient and economical
to use and enable it to be priced
salably.
In All Industries
Fabrication by welding can be
undertaken without heavy capi-
tal expenditures and carried out
at low cost. Welding is used in
every industry for maintenance,
for construction and for the fab-
steel tubing.
rication of many products. The
welding of mechanical refrigera-
tors and gas ranges is typical of
its productionapplications. Other
typical applications include weld-
ing of chromium steel for re-
sistance to sea water corrosion on
seaplane pontoons, welding
aluminum fuel tanks forairplanes,
welding of the frame work of
alloy steel on the new high speed
railroad trains, welding of stain-
less steel beer barrels and innu-
merable other familiar products.
Welding is Simple
Production Tool
Welding is the preferred method
of fabricating almost evcrv design
in modern metals. Jointless weld-
ing can be done rapidly with a
minimum of preparation of the
pieces to be joined. Under pro-
cedure control providing jigs for
positioning pieces, production
can be as rapid and as free from
rejections as any highly devel-
oped factory process. From the
plant equipment standpoint it is
easy to adopt welding. From the
personnel standpoint the welding
technique is quickly acquired
through instruction by compe-
tent engineers.
For Jointless Strength
and Safety
Products fabricated by welding
are jointless, leakproof, perma-
nent and safe. Improved methods
of testing make it possible to tell
exactly what stresses or loads a
jointless welded assembly can
take. Metals of different compo-
sitions, providing the most suit-
able material for the service it is
to perform, can be welded into
sound unified assemblies forever
free from any of the losses which
occur from joint failures.
Specialized Welding
Assistance
To utilize the new alloys and
metals fully, the advice of com-
petent engineers in welded design
is advisable. The Lindc Air Prod-
ucts Company, a unit of Union

a given cut. The wear of the tool is pictured through-
out the tool life. The cutting temperature and the
components of the cutting force are shown for given
cutting conditions at each of numerous cutting speeds
when such elements of the tool shape as nose radius,
side-cutting angle, side-rake angle, and back-rake
angle are systematically varied. It is shown in con-
clusion that the cutting force remains constant at all
cutting speeds and that the temperature increases from
about 575 deg. F. to 1,000 deg. F. in direct proportion
to the cutting speed. From the data, it is shown that,
when cutting steel under the conditions of tests, the
optimum tool shape is maintained for a back-rake angle
of 8 deg., a side-rake angle of 22 deg., a side-cutting
angle of 45 deg., and a nose radius of about '/$ inch.
This paper is one of a series on this subject, and was
presented at the annual meeting of the A.S.M.E. in
New York, Dec. 5, 1934.
ALGEBRA MADE EASY
Mathematicians have long sought a means for solv-

plicated algebraic
equations mechan-
ically.
By inscribing a
square in a right
triangle Mr. Well-
ington happened
upon several remarkable theorems; the most important
of these being that the area of the inscribed square
equals the product of the legs, each diminished by the
edge of the square. By use of the trianalyst it is pos-
sible to solve problems involving multiplication, divi-
sion, addition, subtraction, powers, roots, and roots of
quadratics, cubics, biquadratics and certain forms of
simultaneous equations.

in Machine Parts
The i&gt;aj&gt;er by Dr. F. L. Everett presented December
4, 1934, at the Annual Meeting of the A.S.M.K. in New-
York City, explained by citing various test cases, the
value of investigating fractured parts. When such, in-
formation is assembled in a systematic order it shall
become of great importance to the designing engineer.
Analysis of fractures based upon the character of the
stresses is apt to be neglected. Fractures do occur be-
cause of faulty relationship between the design and the
imposed loads. The designer can afford to consult the
records of fractures which have taken place in practice
—when they are made available.
Many failures are the result of variable stress or
fatigue, originating at points of stre&gt;s concentration.
Innumerable illustrations of improper design which
lead to fractures may be found based on too small til-
lets, holes, and sharp-edged keyways.
A crankshaft, as one practical example which was
mentioned in the paper, failed at the crank pin, near
the base of the small fillet. The crankshaft is submitted
to severe torsion and bending stresses which are con-
stantly varying each revolution. The designer is apt
to overlook the necessity of providing sufficiently large
fillets to prevent the formation of fatigue cracks. In
thi&gt; instance, failure was due to too sharp fillets al-
though the crankshaft was redesigned my merely in-
creasing slightly the size of the pin. A better informed
designer would have investigated the possibility of
increasing slightly the size of the fillets.
Design in industrial problems will be vastly im-
proved when more intelligent study is made on analysis
of fractured machine parts from the standpoint of
stress analysis. Teaching design in engineering col-
leges by considering actual typical cases of failures will
make students more useful to industry. A need is
evident for collecting and disseminating information
among designers on failures in machine parts.
NEW CLASS FILTERS HEAT
A new type of glass which acts as a heat filter gives
promise of becoming very important in the field of air
conditioning. Windows and skylights of this glass will
remove most of the heat rays from the sunlight, yet
will pass almost all of the visible part of the solar
spectrum. Small amounts of iron in the glass catch
the heat rays. If proper ventilation is provided around
the outside surface most of the heat will be carried
away by the air; the remaining heat is rcracliated. half
to the outside and half to the inside. The heat that
is radiated into the room is spread out in all directions,
so that a person sitting in a beam of sunlight feels
little, if anv. heat from the beam.
Engineers!
Final exams will soon be here, bringing with them

A tentative program of Public Works in Michigan
compiled from the plans of state departments, the Pub-
lic Works Administration, the Michigan Committee
for Trade Recovery and other sources where needs
have been expressed, calls for an expenditure of $474,-
200,000.00 in the next five to ten year period, accord-
ing to a summary included in a progress report sub-
mitted to the National Resources Board.
The report is the result of a six months survey of
the state's resources by the Michigan Planning Com-
mission working in conjunction with federal consult-
ants, state departments., the University of Michigan
and the Michigan State College. An FERA project
provided much of the technical and clerical assistance
for the work.
The report was requested by the Resources Board
as a condition determining the extension of further
federal assistance to planning activity in Michigan. Its
submission to the National Board was announced by
Claude S. Carney, chairman of the Planning Commis-
sion.
The preliminary five to ten year program is divided
as follows:
Highways (State and Federal Trunk Pine
System) $60,000,000
Water Supply 16,500.000
Sewage Treatment Facilities 40.200.000
State Conservation Projects 35.OOJ.000
State Buildings 46.500.000
Miscellaneous Public Works (Municipal)
Improvements, Paving. Grade Separa-
tions, Bridges, Flood Control, etc.) 48,030.000
Public Buildings (Schools, Hospitals, City
and County Buildings, etc.) 26.030.000
Electric Plants and System 2.030.030
Housing 200.000.00:)
Total Preliminary Program $474,200,003
The report is a 350 page publication relating the his-
tory of the formation and organization of the Planning
Commission, the status of planning as a state function
and offers a treatise on the import of planning in Mich-
igan.
In addition to the chapter on Public Works, it has
sections on Social and Population Trends, Physical
and CI histological Features, Base Data Surveys, i*and
Use Planning, Watel Resources. Mineral Resources,
Trunk Line Highway System. Education and Govern-
ment.
The Michigan Commission is one of more than 40
states cooperating with the National Resources Board
to prepare "a program and plan of procedure dealing
with the physical, social, governmental and economic
aspects of public policies for the development and use
of land, water and other national resources" in accord-
ance with the order of President Roosevelt.

SEDAN TO SYDNEY
Radio Engineers were up bright and early not long
ago to make a two-way radio-conversation test
between the General Electric short-wave station
W2XAF near Schenectady and station VK2ME at
Sydney, Australia, 10,000miles away. 11 was 6:30 a.m.
in Schenectady and 10 o'clock, at night in Sydney.
Everything was in readiness, but C. H. Lang, U. of
Michigan, '16, manager of the Company's Publicity
Dept., who was to talk to officials in Australia, was
delayed at his home. On a chance, the radio police
test car, which G-E engineers had equipped for two-
way radio communication for the Boston Police
Dept., was sent to pick up Mr. Lang. From the car,
Mr. Lang's voice was sent by ultrashort waves to
the G-E plant and from there by land wire to
W2XAF for transmission to Australia. Conversation
from Australia was picked up at the short-wave
station, sent by land wire to the plant, and from there
by the special police transmitter to the moving car.
So successful were the results, despite the compli-
cated hook-up, that the small sedan continued to
cruise about the Schenectady streets for 15 or 20
minutes more, Mr. Lang carrying on his part in the
conversation through an ordinary French-type
telephone.
YELLOW LIGHT ON CAPE MAY
The orange-yellow light of General Electric sodium-
vapor lamps now illumines roadways in more than
50 installations. It is also being used to light the
facades and towers of buildings.
Hut now this light has another application—in the
lighthouse at Cape May, N. J., at the entrance to
Delaware Bay. The Cape May Lighthouse was
erected in 1859. Its light source is 165 feet above
mean high water and can be seen for approximately
19 nautical miles under clear atmospheric conditions.
The lens is a first-order, 16-pancl, flashing lens
rotated by motor drive so that the beam of light has
a four-second flash and a 26-second eclipse. The lamp
itself does not flash—the rotation of the lens causing
the alternate flash and eclipse.
In this test with the sodium-vapor lamp, all equip-
ment has been supplied by the General Electric Com-
pany, and the installation was made by the Fourth
Lighthouse District.
FISH GYM
The patrons of Joe Medway, a restaurateur up in
New York State, literally fished for their dinners.
They chose and netted their trout from a large
pool. But what made Mr. Medway and his patrons
unhappy was that the trout, presumably because of
the treacherous refinements of effete pool life, be-
came sissies. They just nosed around listlessly.
One day Mr. Medway gathered up a batch of netting
by the pool and placed it in his General Electric
washing machine for a rinsing. When he removed
the net, there was a trout jumping about the mach-
ine in a most sprightly fashion. It exhibited such
joyous abandon, in comparison with its sluggish
brothers in the pond, that he turned on the activating
element again to give it real satisfaction. The trout
then accelerated its speed and leaped about in the
swirling currents as though it were swimming for
life or love in a mountain stream. Mr. Medway
threw it back in the pond. It was off like a flash,
and had soon churned up the placid waters into a sea
of tiny whitecaps with its capers. Then, says Mr.
Medway, the bit of spotted dynamite swished in to
shore, came to a spray-raising stop, and with
wiggles and flops implored its owner for another turn
in the washer.
Well, Mr. Medway bought six more General Electric
washing machines, and now all the trout are sys-
tematically exercised. Mr. Medway is willing to bet
that there isn't a single speckled trout from the
wildest streams in the country that could last a half
a round with his trout. "Because," he says, "they're
scientific trained."

Electrical Welding
PHILIP EWALD, '35E
Aluminum is today no longer the valuable curiosity
that it was not so long ago; it lias come to be regarded
as one of the major useful elements in industry. It
has attained an importance equal to that of steel and
copper, for, with modern technique, it and its alloys
have been given properties never before heard of. It
is light, with an atomic weight of only 27. Some of
its alloys have been made as strong as steel. It is
resistant to all types. of corrosion except from salt
water, and that has been eliminated by proper alloying.
Its natural softness makes machining easy. And for
one more point, it has a natural luster, pleasing to
the eye.
Industry has not been slow to recognize these prop-
erties, and today aluminum is being put into use every-
where. The new automobiles and streamline trains
demanding rapid accelerations have employed alumi-
num. Aviation has found it indispensable. The truck-
ing industry has discovered that aluminum bodies mean
increased pay loads. Longer bridges are being made
possible because of it. notably the new San Francisco
Bay span. Finally, anyone who attended the Century
of Progress saw how aluminum was entering the home
not only in the already familiar cooking utensils, but
in chairs, window frames, radiators, and all types of
art work.
The future use of aluminum in all these
examples is assured by cheaper produc-
tion methods and by unlimited aluminum
deposits. It is estimated that % of the
earth's crust is composed of aluminum
ores. It will truly be the metal of the
future when present iron and copper de-
|K)sits run out. Its use is assured further-
more by its high salvage value. A manu-
facturer will not hesitate to invest in a
metal when he knows that there will be
no loss due to rusting and that he can
sell it for scrap at a high price.
In its early development everything
indicated an unlimited use of aluminum
except for one drawback: the methods of
welding aluminum were few and limited
in application. That was unfortunate be-
cause welded joints are much superior to
riveted jobs not only from the standpoint
of strength and appearance, but because they make
possible greater speed of operation in production jobs.
This last is especially true of electric welding. The
trouble was that the operators tried to apply the same
methods of welding to aluminum that they had been
using on steel and copper, and it wouldn't work. They
then simply concluded that aluminum could not be
welded and let it go at that. Happily, the difficulty was
soon discovered. The ever-present coat of aluminum
oxide on the surfaces prevented proper contact of the
welding metal. The problem was first solved for gas
welding by a development of a flux to remove the
oxide. It was then applied to the arc welding of alu-
minum, both carbon and metallic.
The metallic arc welding of aluminum was devel-
oped on a commercial scale shortly after the War. The
process is similar to that used for other metals. An
arc is struck between the metal to be welded and a rod
of the same metal. The intense heat forms a molten
pool in the parent metal, and metal from the rod
carries across the arc to build up the weld. Current
is supplied from a direct-current generator at about
400 amperes at 30 volts for aluminum up to yi inch
thick. The difference in the processes is that the alu-
minum welding rod is coated with the oxide removing
flux.

The carbon arc process was put into commercial use
about 1925. For this method, the arc is struck be-
tween the material to be welded and a carbon electrode.
The flux coated rod is then fed into the arc. This
process has been limited to simple butt and lap welds.
It is more flexible than the metallic arc however, for
the arc intensity and flow of rod metal can be regu-
lated independently. It is now lending itself admirably
to automatic welding machines.
The secret of success of these methods is, of course,
the oxide removing flux which must fulfill these re-
quirements :.
1. It must melt at a temperature just below that of
aluminum. If the point were higher, the oxide
would not be removed in time. If much lower, the
flux would volatilize before the aluminum melted.
2. It must remove oxide quickly to insure free weld-
ing of the molten aluminum and must prevent
reforming of the oxide.
3. The molten flux, with the oxide, must have a
specific gravity less than that of molten alumi-
num so that it will come quickly to the surface.
Otherwise the weld would harden with the oxide
inside and a consequent reduction of strength.
4. It must be stable and effective even in the high
temperature of the arc.
5. It must not absorb moisture or deteriorate with
time, and must bind well on the rod.
This seems like a formidable list of qualities for a flux
to possess, but they have been obtained, and arc weld-
ing is an established process in the fabrication of
aluminum articles.
Another field that has just come into existence in
the past few years for aluminum, and is now being
developed commercially, is in resistance welding. This
method stirs the imagination more than arc welding,
for all that is necessary is to place the parts to be
welded together in the desired position, say "hocus-
pocus," and the job is completed. In this case, the
"hocus-pocus" is a shot of electricity. The actual
process is not quite so simple as this, and for alumi-
num, the placement of parts and application of elec-
tricity offer several interesting problems.
The simplest of the resistance types is butt welding.
As applied to aluminum, the parts to be welded are
placed together under a pressure of about 2000 pounds
per square inch, and then a current with a density of
around 30.000 amperes per square inch is passed be-
tween the parts. The resistance of the joint causes suffi-
cient heat to melt the parts in that vicinity. The parts
then move together under the pressure for a predeter-
mined distance until a contactor opens the power circuit.
In another type, flash-butt welding, the current is al-
ready on before pressure is applied. This method is not
generally used with aluminum however. Alternating cur-
rent has been found to be satisfactory for butt welding,
and offers a convenient method of obtaining high
currents. All that is needed is a transformer with a
couple of turns of heavy bus for a secondary as against
the direct current requirement of a motor-generator
with an elaborate commutator. Only 10 volts open
circuit are needed on the secondary, and these mostly
to overcome the various drops in the leads and second-
ary winding. Considerable care must be exercised in
running the current into the parts. It must be run in
so that the current density is as near uniform over the
welded surfaces as possible. This requirement limits
the usefulness of butt welding to large and symmetrical
parts. It is further limited in that the joint is weak

by the nature of the process. The weld itself is of
cast characteristic, and the adjacent material annealed.
By heat treatment however, the strength may be
brought up to 70 or 80 per cent that of the umvelded
material.
The most interesting forms of resistance welding,
spot and seam welding, have been applied to aluminum
only in the past few years, and are just now being
commercially developed. The spot welding technique
is similar to that used for steel. A pair of electrodes
clamp the parts to be welded under high pressure, and
a shot of current is applied. Difficulties arise however
in using standard equipment on aluminum. The metal
is so soft that the inertia of the electrodes puts dents
into it. Because of its high conductivity, greater cur-
rents are needed for aluminum than an electrode de-
signed for steel will handle, causing overheating. Lastly,
aluminum "mushes" just before melting so that by the

become soft and the electrodes crush in. Denting has
been eliminated by the obvious method of lightening
the electrodes and reducing their distance of throw.
Heating is taken care of by water cooling. The mush-
ing problem was ingeniously taken care of for certain
manually operated machines by the use of the elec-
trodes shown in Figure 2. The small projection on the
lower electrodes localizes current to a spot until the
electrode sinks into the soft aluminum up to the flat
surface. This reduces current density and further
heating until the operator can shut the current off.
Very few jobs are done with these electrodes now.
Practically all spot welding is done with conical tipped
electrodes, and with automatic electric power control
which will be described later. An ideal spot weld cross
section between two thin sheets is shown in Figure 3.
In seam welding, similar equipment is used except
that rollers are substituted for the electrodes. For a
gas tight weld, it is desirable to have a series of over-
lapping spots as shown in Figure 4. It would be al-
most impossible to make a weld like this manually, so
the problem of automatic control is introduced. Me-
chanical methods did not go so well. It is pretty hard
to start and stop several thousand amperes several times
a second as would be required in making a seam weld.
Electrical means were then introduced. In one of the
most ingenious of them, two alternating currents of
different frequency were run into the welding machine.
Then as the metal ran through the rollers, a spot would
be produced every time a beat came along. The rapid-
ity of spots per second could then be governed by vary-
ing the frequency of one current. This method soon
gave way to electronic control, a more accurate type
using some of the newly developed tubes.
With this method, the welding current is run directly
through mercury vapor rectifiers provided with a con-
trol which is in some cases a grid, and in others an
igniting device. Two of these tubes are always used
opjxjsed to permit passage of both directions of the
A.C. The tubes either oj&gt;erate or they don't depending
on the state of the control device, and control of weld-
ing current is thus possible.
At first, these rectifiers were operated by glow-
discharge tubes which were controlled by a condenser-
resistor combination. The combination could be preset
to cause the discharge tubes to operate for a desired
number of cycles. This method was later supplanted by
a photo-cell control device.
This device used a toothed wheel, which was driven
by a synchronous motor, between a light source and
the photo-cell. The teeth correspond to half cycles, 120
of them going by per second. The open spaces between
the teeth permitted light impulses to pass to the photo-
cell which in turn operated the discharge tube. The
number of cycles desired for operation could then be
obtained by masking out some of the open spaces.
With apparatus of this type, the application of cur-
rent to the weld could be controlled accurately, a boon
to thin sheet welding. In fact, some work is now being
done where only a fraction of a half cycle per spot
can be used. One other advantage of this apparatus
is that the phase of power application could be con-
trolled, and power surges thus prevented by always
starting operation when the current was zero. This
apparatus was not designed especially for aluminum
welding although many of the features were incor-
porated as a result of the needs of the industry. Most
of the apparatus can be used interchangeably with steel
and copper.
It is apparent that the welding bugaboo is just about
extinct in the aluminum industry. Proper considera-
tions have been taken of the properties peculiar to
aluminum in developing welding apparatus, and today
aluminum may he welded in almost any shape or man-
ner desired.

PECULIARITIES OF AIR LINER DIETS
The worst thing in the world to feed an airplane
passenger is—cauliflower. This statement comes from
no less an authority than the chief dietitian for Impe-
rial Airways. He had it on the menu one day—a beau-
tiful, calm day—but the worst happened to all except
one of the eighteen passengers. Surprised at the result,
but curious too, he took a trip himself the following
day and again had cauliflower served. Only two of
the ten in the plane were able to maintain their dignity,
and the chief dietitian himself admits that he wasn't
one of the two.
Another discovery is that color plays a large part in
soothing the stomach that tends to become acrobatic
during aerial travel. A lettuce and tomato salad has
been found to be jxirticularly effective, the combination
of red and green forming a perfect color scheme which
apparently appeals to the artistic stomach. Apples also
are on the approved list, but mayonnaise, custard and
tinned foods are taboo. At 7,000 feet tongue becomes
black, leathery and uneatable. These are only a few of
the many queer discoveries he has made.

SAMUEL T. DANA, Dean
School of Forestry and Conservation
"There is no such animal known among men as a
wood expert," counsel for the defense exclaimed when
Arthur Koehler testified as to the source of the wood
in the Lindbergh kidnap ladder. The judge was quite
right in disagreeing with this view and in admitting
the testimony; for Mr. Koehler. a graduate of the
Department of Forestry at the University of Michigan
and for many years a wood technologist at the Forest
Products Laboratory at Madison. Wisconsin, is inter-
nationally recognized as a specialist in this field. Nor
is lie by any means the only one, either in this country
or abroad, entitled to such recognition.
At the same time it is unfortunately true that wood
experts, though not unknown, are still a relatively
scarce animal. Moreover, most of them are connected
with educational and research institutions rather than
with the wood-using industries, where one would
naturally expect the largest opportunities for employ-
ment.
This situation is one that cannot long continue. To-
day any industry or any concern that operates its busi-
ness on the principle that "what was good enough for
my grandfather is good enough for me." is headed
straight for trouble of the most serious sort. The
extensive employment of technically trained men by
the manufacturers of iron, steel, cement, rubber, chemi-
cals, and other materials gives concrete recognition of
their appreciation of this fact. Manufacturers of wood
will soon have to follow suit or invest their capital,
if they are lucky enough to have any left, in some
other business. Whatever may have been the case
in the past, it is no longer true either that no special
knowledge is needed to use wood satisfactorily, or that
it is so indispensable that it will sell itself no matter
how jxiorly it is handled. There is. however, no reason
why wood should not continue to hold its own in com-
petition with other materials through the development
of new uses and more effective methods of manufac-
ture and treatment.
The opportunities in this direction are enormous,
although perhaps not generally appreciated. According
to the 1930 Census, the wood-using industries ranked
second in number of establishments and number of
employees among the major groups of manufacturing
industries of the country. They had a payroll of well
over a billion dollars. They utilized a raw material
the supply of which can be indefinitely maintained under
proper methods of forest management. And they fur-
nish a market for the product of some 500 million acres
of land chiefly valuable for forest purposes.
Clearly the welfare of the nation as a whole, as well
as of their owners and employees, is intimately associ-
ated with the maintenance of the wood-using industries.
This is primarily a matter of technics. It involves mak-
ing the most of the many virtues of wood, chief among
which is its adaptability to a wide variety of uses, and
minimizing its defects. One of the first steps, and it
is by no means an impossible one, is to devise methods
of treatment to render wood shrink-proof. fire-proof,
bug-proof, and rot-proof. Manufacturing processes,
which now waste from 65 to 90 per cent of the contents
of the standing tree, must be improved. Products must
be better adapted to the purposes for which they are to
be used. New uses must be found, particularly in the
chemical field, where such articles as artificial lumber,
ethyl alcohol, sugar, and substitutes for cotton, wool,
and leather already loom as distinct commercial possi-
bilities.
Progress in all of these fields requires the services
of technically trained men who are not now available.
Really competent wood technologists are not quite as
scarce as hen's teeth, but the simile is not an inappro-
priate one. This is partly because the industries have
not as yet made any general demand for such men.
and partly hecause the programs of study offered by
educational institutions have for the most part failed

organic material and of the engineering processes by
which it is utilized.
It was to remedy this latter situation that plans were
worked out last spring for cooperation between the
College of Engineering and the School of Forestry and
Conservation in providing a well-rounded professional
training such as has not previously been available either
at the University of Michigan or elsewhere. Hereafter
the School of Forestry and Conservation will otTer two
distinct programs of study in ( 1) Forest Production
and (2) Wood Technology. Those interested in forest
production, which includes all activities connected with
the protection, growth, management, and administra-
tion of forests, will continue to take their two years
of pre-forestry work in the College of Literature, Sci-
ence, and the Arts. Those interested in wood technol-
ogy, which includes all activities connected with the
manufacture, distribution, and marketing of wood and
other tree products, will on the contrary take their pre-
forestry work in the College of Engineering. This must
cover at least two years, and an additional year is
strongly recommended.
Another important innovation is the establishment
of a Combined Curriculum in Engineering and For-
estry, which is regarded as the ideal training for the
prospective wood technologist. Those following this
curriculum spend three years in the College of En-
gineering, where their work is very similar to that in
the regular program in mechanical engineering except
for the inclusion of an elementary course in botany
and of a brief survey course in forestry.
On the completion of this work with a minimum
average grade of 2.5, the student is recommended for
transfer to the School of Forestry and Conservation.
Satisfactory completion of the first year in that School
(|ualifies the student for the degree of Bachelor of
Science in Engineering; while satisfactory completion
of the second year, and the meeting of the School's
requirements for the master's degree, qualifies him for
the degree of Master of Forestry (Wood Technology).
The work in the School of Forestry and Conservation
deals primarily with the structure, identification, prop-
erties, and uses of woods, and with the processes used
in their manufacture and treatment. Specific courses
are given in such subjects as anatomy and properties
of woods, wood pathology, wood-products insects, log-
ging and wood utilization, wood-using industries, prin-
ciples of lumber grading, timber mechanics, conditioning
and preservative treatment of woods, plywood and
laminated construction, and chemical utilization of
woods. Enough work is also included in the field of
forest production to give the wood technologist an
appreciation of the activities and problems in that field,
and more particularly a knowledge of the distribution
and abundance of various kinds of woods and a clear
understanding of the relationship between the character
A Load of Lumber Entering the Dry Kiln.
of the product and the conditions under which it is
grown.
The Combined Curriculum is designed to prepare
those who are interested in obtaining a broad knowledge
of the whole field of wood technology, or who are par-
ticularly interested in some one industry or in some
specific aspect of wood utilization such as kiln drying,
wood preservation, or timber testing. Graduates with
supplementary practical experience should be well
qualified for service as investigators, technicians, or
executives.
So far the demand for investigators has come pri-
marily from the government and from educational
institutions. There is every reason, however, to believe
that this is a temporary situation, and that the wood-
using industries will shortly find themselves forced as
a matter of self-preservation to follow the lead of the
iron and steel, cement, and other competing industries
which are now spending millions of dollars a year on
research. When this time comes there will be an active
demand for well-trained men to participate in the end-
less search to learn all there is to be known about wood
and its uses.
An even greater demand is likely in the near future
for technicians, whose main task is that of applying
the results obtained by the investigator. Scant as is
our present knowledge in the field of wood technology,
we still know far more than we are putting into prac-
tice. Various factors tend to prevent the prompt use
of laboratory results in commercial operations; and of
these one of the most important is the lack of men with
technical training necessary to bridge the gap between
theory and practice. This is by no means a purely
routine affair to be reduced to rule of thumb and turned
over to an ordinary foreman, but requires skill of
a higher order.
Finally, the executive in a wood-using industry today
is hardly less in need of a technical training than the
technician and the investigator. Administrative ability
is of course a prime requisite for those in managerial

can be utilized to best advantage if it is supplemented
by sound technical knowledge of the raw material in-
volved and of the processes by which it is manufactured.
Professional training is an asset not to be ignored by-
anyone looking forward to executive work in modern
industry.
Unless all signs fail, wood technology is a profession
destined shortly to come into its own, with opportunities
for employment at least as good and perhaps even
better than those existing today in forest production.
The University of Michigan is breaking new ground in
making the combined facilities of the College of Engi-
neering and of the School of Forestry and Conserva-
tion available for the training of men interested in this
field. It is confidently believed that graduates from the
Combined Curriculum will be thoroughly equipped for
high grade professional work, and that they will con-
tribute their share toward making the wood technolo-
gist an animal well and favorably known to all men.
Cast Iron Melting Practice
Can Be Improved
A. Dl CIULIO
This work was done under the supervision of Prof. A. E. White,
Director of the Department of Engineering Research
The importance of gray cast iron as an engineering
material has steadily increased during the last decade.
At the present, gray cast iron can be produced which
possesses physical properties that, a few years ago. were
only the hopes of a few foundrymen and metallurgists.
Researches on gray cast iron have generally dealt
with the study of such important factors as chemical
composition, alloy additions, heat treatment, and the
nature of the raw material used. However, another im-
portant factor which has not been the subject of exten-
sive research is the melting practice. Metallurgists have
recognized that the structure and physical properties
of metals and alloys which are used in the "as cast"
condition depend mainly on the maximum temperature
to which the molten metal is heated, and also on the
temperature from which the metal is poured into the
mold, but, in the case of gray cast iron, these factors
have not been investigated. Of the alloys used in the
"as cast" condition, gray cast iron is by far the most
important, not only on the basis of total production, but
also of its use in very vital parts of automobiles, Diesel
engines, locomotives, and machinery in general.
The experimental work of this research was carried
out in a commercial furnace in the foundry of the Uni-
versity of Michigan. It covers mainly the study of the
effects that the following factors have on the structure
and properties of gray cast iron:
a. the maximum temperature to which the metal is
heated after melting.

Chemical Engineering.

into the mold.
The type of gray iron investigated was the one gener-
ally known as automobile cylinder iron, which con-
tains about 3.20 per cent total carbon and 2.20 per cent
silicon. Temperature measurements in the neighbor-
hood of 3100° F had to be made inside of the electric
furnace, and for this purpose a specially protected noble
metal thermo-couple was found to be the most reliable.
Effect of Superheating
The investigation of the effect of superheating was
carried out by melting the charge, heating to a definite
temperature, allowing to cool in the furnace, and pour-
ing into baked sand cores from a certain temperature,
which was kept the same in all experiments. The stand-
ard specimens thus obtained were used for determining
the physical properties and for chemical as well as
microscopical analysis.
Photomicrograph No. 1 shows the typical structure
of an ordinary automobile cylinder iron, while No. 2
and No. 3 show the structure of the same iron after
being superheated to and poured from indicated temper-
atures. Photomicrograph No. 2 shows that the iron has
undergone a refinement of the graphite flakes which
results in an increase in the physical properties, while
in Photomicrograph No. 3 the graphite flakes outline
a dendritic pattern which results in a decrease of the
physical properties, since it breaks up very thoroughly
the continuity of the matrix.
The results of this investigation are briefly sum-
marized as follows:
1. Superheating within limits improves the phys-
ical properties of cast iron about 20 per cent.
2. Too high a superheating temperature is detri-
mental to cast iron. The lowest superheating temper-
ature which produces detrimental or non-beneficial
effects may be designated as the "critical superheat-
ing temperature."
3. It has been proved that the critical superheating
temperature is lower, the lower the total carbon con-
tent of the iron.
Effect of Pouriug Temperature
Some confusion exists as to the meaning of the
term "pouring temperature." Most previous investi-
gators have confused this temperature with the maxi-
mum temperature to which molten metal is heated. In
this investigation, the pouring temperature is the
temperature taken in the ladle just before the metal is
poured into the molds.
The results of this research may be summarized as
follows:
1. The pouring temperature has a definite effect
upon the physical properties of cast iron.
2. There exists an optimum pouring temperature
which varies for different irons investigated within
the range of 2680°F. and 2850°F.
3. Cast irons poured from temperatures either
above or below this range have lower physical proper-
ties than irons poured within this range.
4. Cast irons poured from temperatures higher
than the optimum range show both coarse and fine
graphite flakes. This condition results in a material
of non-uniform properties.
5. Cast irons poured from too low a temperature
show exsessively large graphite flakes, which results
in a much weaker iron.
In conclusion, it may be stated that this research
points to the fact that foundrymen must exercise great
care in controlling the superheating and pouring
temperatures in order to be able to produce gray cast
irons of improved properties.
HERE'S ENAMEL ON YOUR BATH TUB
Cast iron sinks, tubs, drains, lavoratories
and other pieces of sanitary ware are
sprayed with wet enamel thus prepared.
After this first coat has dried it is burned
on for 8 minutes in a gas fired furnace at
a temperature of 1600-1700 degrees F. The
workman on the right is sifting the dry
enamel on a white hot bath tub for the
second coat after the first has been burned
on. This second coat is burned for 2 to 3
minutes and a third coat is usually applied.
The workman on the left operates the
crane which carries the tub into the fur-
nace and manipulates the buttons on the
floor at his feet to control the temperature
of the furnace.

Henry W. Merker
"Static Chaser" Merker ( Are you

students who. in spite of long tedi-
ous hours, still gets there. Henry at-
tended Central High School in De-
troit, entering the University at the
tender age of 18. By dint of keeping
his eyes open and his mouth shut he
has managed to "do things" in the
Engineering College. At the present
time, he holds the highly desirable
office of President of the A.I.E.E.
student branch. He was a member
of Phi Eta Sigma, freshman hon-
orary, and on the Jacket committee
of his class. He also holds at this
time the position of the Vice-presi-
dent of Tau Beta Pi, in addition to
being a member of Vulcans and
Delta Phi fraternity.
John F. Schmidt
"Local Boy Makes Good." And
how good ! John E. Schmidt came to
the University direct from the Uni-
versity High School, the holder of
an Alumni .Association Scholarship.
The faith of the Alumni was re-
warded by his attainments, scho-
lastic and otherwise, so that he has
continued to hold the Scholarship
for four years. As a Junior he also
held a Mandelbaum Scholarship.
His average is one of those things
unknown to most of us—pretty dog-
gone near to 4.0. Since we can't hope
to approach him on that level, we
prefer to know him as a pleasant,
industrious, "mechanical." a good
fellow, who does not hesitate to
speak his mind, but who would not
hurt a flea. He is the president of
the Mechanical Division of the
A.S.M.E.. a member of Tau Beta
Pi. and Phi Kappa Phi. An interest
in languages (and Lit. school fem-
mes—who knows?) has led him to
become a member of both the Cercle
Erancais and Deutscher Zirkel.
Robert W. Sloane
Bob Sloane got his start in the
Windy City at the University of
Chicago High, entering here in Sep-
tember 1931 to specialize in Me-
chanical engineering and display his
talents to men. Although school
work kept him occupied, he managed
to join Sigma Phi Epsilon (where
he now hangs his extra shirt and
tie) and become one of the select
group to belong to the honoraries.
Triangles, Vulcans, and Tau Beta
Pi. The Vulcans have chosen him to
keep their minutes in a presentable
fashion for the present year. Bob's
guiding hands have held the reins of
the financial end of the Michigan
Technic in the capacity of Business
Manager for the past year, and a
mighty line job they lxave done. If
you think that isn't a feat, ask the
faculty board. Finances seem to be
Bob's forte, for last year he was
treasurer of the class of '35.
Cale 0. Sterling
Southeastern High in Detroit sent
us Gale O. Sterling, present presi-
dent of Vulcans, senior engineering
honorary society. Engineering could
not keep him fully occupied, so he
spent part of his time at the Field
House for the first three years, at-
taining the position of junior foot-
ball manager last year. He was an
able aide to Phil Singleton, being in
charge of tickets on last year's J-
Hop Committee. Triangles also
claimed him as a member during his
junior year.
Besides his job as president of
Vulcans, lie is varsity tennis man-
ager this year, and a member of Phi
Sigma Kappa fraternity. We heard
rumors of a connection with Con-
temporary, campus literary quar-
terly. Gale is not "just another me-
chanical," but is one of the outstand-
ing men in the department, liked by
students and faculty.
Wilbur C. Nelson
"Eire Brand" Nelson, someone
said, and it stuck. What a dignified
name for the president of the Aero-
nautical Division of tlve A.S.M.E.
Student branch! Although organ-
ized only since September, the Aero-
nautical Division has become one of
the few "wide awake" professional
societies in the College, thanks to
Bill. Its membership is well over
fifty. Although a transfer from
Flint Junior College, Bill hasn't let
a blade of grass grow under his feet
since he arrived here. He is one of
the shining lights of the Department
(in more ways than one) and is a
member of Tau Beta Pi.

Says the Editor
I
Now that the hullabaloo about
Student Government has died, we
engineers, who do not exactly have
"student government" problems,
had begun thinking of our own little
sphere.
Though we don't have "govern-
ment" problems, because we don't
create them, there are other prob-
lems which face us. Let's take
them in order:
1. As a professional school, we
should be a closely knit body with
a professional "feeling" which
draws us closely together. In our
own way we should be recognized
on the campus as a group of young
men (and women) trying to get the
most out of the University in the
way of education, both intellectual
and social.
It was with this idea in mind that
the Engineering Council was estab-
lished. After puttering along for
years, its constitution was revised
and it was given something on
which to work. Then what hap-
pened? The school year began, the
field was set for action, and the
council sat still. Before any move
was made, it was referred to the
Undergraduate Council, that "aug-
ust" body which settles the "prob-
lems" of student government. We
rise to object!
As constituted and set up, the En-
gineering Council is meant to decide
and act upon matters of interest to
engineering students without any
outside meddling. If engineers
can't run their own affairs heaven
help them!
That engineers can "make things
go" is evidenced by the two divi-
sions of the A. S. M. E. student
branch. They are fortunate in hav-
ing wide-awake students at their
head. Every memlier of the Council
should l&gt;e wide-awake, or else there
shouldn't be any Council.
Student leaders in the College are
planning a monster Open House on
the grand scale of years ago, with
the help of Dean Sadler and every
member of, the faculty. At present
they are afraid to turn the details
of the plan over to the Engineering
Council because of the lethargy of
the Council in the past. Isn't this
a sad state of affairs?
2. Another problem is that of
somehow acquainting the men who
transfer from Junior Colleges with
the life of the Engineering College.
At present nearly fifty percent of
each junior class is made up of
transfers. There are plenty of fine
young men in this group, but be-
cause they haven't been with the
class as freshmen and sophomores
they seem to feel "out" of things,
and to conduct themselves more like
graduate students than as under-
graduates.
We advocate a series of meetings
of a more or less social nature at
the beginning of the year at which
outstanding students of the College
could explain the functions of the
various professional societies and
the activities open to these students.
An enterprising Engineering Coun-
cil would have solved this problem
long ago and abolished the sad con-
dition which exists today.
3. Perhaps this doesn't come
under the head of a problem, but
we have noticed time and again that
two or three meetings are being held
on the same night. Something should
be done. Last semester we tried to
maintain a calender for your con-
venience, to avoid duplication of
meeting nights, but it was not used.
If you'd like, we will try again. We
think that the professional societies
should not meet more than once a
month, and that when they do meet,
a real program should be prepared.
A little bit of discretion and fore-
thought would allow students to
attend more of the very worth-while
meetings which are arranged.

ITS MUTINY!
Blast my scuppers and scuttle my gunwales.
If the engine school ain't full of females.
We thought we were naught but hairy eared men,
But we're wrong, we have fair ones, 'round half
a dozen.
Now one's up and brought a retaliation home
To that "Ballad of Slide Rule Sadie" pome.
And it turns out to be no one other than
That Sadie girl herself, lambasting Dapper Dan.
Kngineer Dan—but say no more; action!
And let F.W.D. perform the introduction:
Sadie came back with a pome.
Which only shows she's right at home
With sines and cosines on her mind.
She tells wliat site thinks of mankind.
Hats off to Slide Rule Sadie gents.
Start dishing out the compliments.
She wrote about the engineers.
And did she stand them on their ears!
We know that it would be a sin
Not to put her poetry in.
It dents our proud superiority.
Thank tiod the men are in majority.
Ballad of Dapper Dan
Dapper Dan was an Engineer.
( Here the Lawyers give a Bronx cheer)
This is the ballad of Dapper Dan,
Any big, strong, silent Engineer-man.
Dan, the villain, made cracks about Sadie.
Anyway, Sadie was a lady!
Speaking of glances to the left and right.
Dan, at cribbing, was a fright.
Sadie, poor gal, was all alone.
( Engineer ferns here give a groan).
Dan had the help of all his pals;
Sadie didn't even have the help of six gals.
Danny up and joined a frat;
He got help, and that was that.
All the brothers rallied 'round—
Up came Dan's EM from the ground.
Dan's main weakness was MI'
But wait just a minute; quite on the Q.T.
A conference with the profHe was easily had
And now our dear Danny is not half bad.
Dan soon joined the R.O.T.C.
(A soldier's such a grand thing to be)
They say a uniform makes a man—
Make one of Danny, if yon can!
•—Slide Rule Sadie
(E.L. and F.Z.)
The men hare the last word:
The ladies in the Engine school
Are known to be quite very cool
Perhaps they realize it ain't
Adaptable to skirts and paint.
And then again perhaps they know
The Engineers are not so slow
And they don't trust themselves with men
Who never heard of the word when.
They fuss with slide-rules, calc, and trig
And often take a nasty dig
At men they try to imitate,
Yet make one think they really hate.

With here and there a big thick book,
That someone was reading to pass the time,
A long and langorous weary time.
For this was the day when from miles about,
Students and grads were flocking out
To pound the pavements, heading in
To pay their fees in Barbour Gym.
Old men and young men, slim and stout,
Girls; homely and handsome, bustling about.
Mashing of checks, darns, dammits and hecks.
Dirty faces and clean shining necks,
Heaved and grumbled and rumbled and swayed,
All for the sake of a few fees paid.
And soon they'd all be gone from there.
Rack to their books with a studious air.
And so it goes, twice a year,
Ja wohl! waiter, another beer.
—J. Herman U'icijand
Behold—The Engineer
Since the Lord made the Earth in six days, engineers,
although paid on the six-day basis, have continued to
work seven days and nearly as many nights a week. An
engineer can be recognized by his trusting appearance
and the resigned look on his face, and a table of sines
and cosines next to his heart.
Throughout the ages the engineer has continued to
function, until now, our technical schools yearly turn
out about 10,000 young hopefuls on the American
public, each armed with a slide-rule and a bad case
of brain fatigue due to four years of unremitting toil.
Some of these souls are immediately saved by becom-
ing bond salesmen and insurance agents. Some of the
remaining, after working incessantly as engineers, gain
success by becoming advertising managers, account-
ants, salesmen, and managing executives. lint, alas,
some fail and become Assistant Chief Engineers. Chief
Engineers, and, if complete failures, become Consult-
ing Engineers.
An engineer with the temperament of a grand opera
star* is an inventor and can be recognized by long hair
and flowing bow-tie. There is only one engineer on
record who has become rich. He recently died in Colo-
rado and left a fortune of $50.000 which he amassed
through unceasing toil, superhuman perseverance, re-
markable ingenuity, and the death of an uncle who left
him $49,995.
An engineer is said to be a man who knows a great
deal about little and who goes along knowing more
and more about less and less until finally he knows
practically everything alxjut nothing—whereas : A sales-
man on the other hand, is a man who knows a very
little about a great deal and keeps on knowing less
and less about more and more until finally he knows
practically nothing about everything.

T-SQUARE CLUB
The T-Square Club has been reorganized! Originally
founded in 1914, this engineering women's society was
disbanded in 1929 chiefly because the architectural
students who comprised a majority at that time joined
a national organization.
The following girls met on January 13, 1935 and
formed the nucleus of a club that bids fair to become
well known before the end of the year:
President. Erna Lysette, '38E Chem.; Vice-Presi-
dent, Marion R. Tompkins, '37E Chem.; Secretary-

ALASKAN FLIGHT DESCRIBED TO AEROS
On January 21, Major Ralph Royce gave an illus-
trated lecture before an open meeting of the Aero Divi-
sion of the A.S.M.E. on the Army Air Corps flight
to Alaska during the last summer.
The flight was made to test the new Martin Bombers
which the Air Corps had just received, and to test the
practicability of sending a bombing squadron to far
off places such as Alaska, in time of war or in emer-
gencies. On the return trip, the first non-stop flight
ever made from Alaska to the United States was ac-
complished by the fliers. Major Royce accompanied
the flight as operations officer. After the lecture, Major
Royce answered many questions asked him concerning
the Army Air Corps, and concerning the flight and its
equipment.
On February 18, Milton J. Thompson, of the Aero
Department, gave a talk on adapting data obtained
from a wind tunnel model to the full scale airplane.
Lt. Perrill also gave an interesting talk on the Naval
Air School at Pensacola, Florida.
Plans and arrangements are now being made for in-
spection trips to the aircraft factories and Airports in
the neighborhood of Detroit.

The usual thinning of the ranks due to mid-year
graduation was the cause of the recent special election
of Sigma Rho Tan, Engineering speech society, held
on Wednesday, January twenty-third. The places of
the graduating officers were filled by the following
men: Eric Sommer, president; Robert Lowe, vice-
president; William Donovan, treasurer; Allen Cleve-
land, secretary.
A schedule of the activities for the second semester
was submitted for the approval of the meeting. It pro-
vides for a series of elimination trials in the various
departments of speech in which the organization is
particularly interested. These are, project speaking,
debating, hall of fame speaking, and raconteur or story
telling.
The winners of these trials will compete in a final
contest to be held in May. Plaques will be awarded by
the Detroit Technical Societies and suitable prizes will
be given by the local chapter of Sigma Rho Tau.
At the beginning of the first semester, about fifty out
of the one hundred and fifty men who applied were
put into training under the tutelage of the older mem-
bers. Of this number, fifteen were elected to the Stump
Speakers Society which is the first step toward becom-
ing a member of Sigma Rho Tau itself. These are to
be initiated during the first two weeks of the second
semester. Late in May, any other men who have ful-
filled the requirements will be initiated.
Directly after this second initiation, the annual
Sigma Rho Tau banquet will be held. At this banquet,
the Novices who have completed the necessary require-
ments will be raised to an Associate membership and the
Associate members of the past year who have done
exceptional work in the society will be inducted into
full membership. ^
HAWLEY SPEAKS TO A.S.M.E.
On Wednesday, January 16, Prof. R. S. Hawley of
the Mechanical Engineering Department, gave a talk
on "Modern Trends in Small Power Plants" before
the Mechanical Division of the A.S.M.E. He traced
the history of power plants, illustrating his lecture with
excerpts from the publication "Power Plant Engineer-
ing." He showed that at first power plants were small
because the power demand of industry was small, but
the demand grew steadily, and in the boom days much
larger plants were put in operation. During the de-
pression, though, invention and a reaction against large
public utilities have made for smaller, but just as effi-
cient plants. In illustrating the technical advances, he
cited the University Power Plant, since it has followed
all the trends in new developments in small power
plants.
On February 13, 1935. the student branch of the
A.S.M.E. held an extended meeting at which many
interesting items were brought up for discussion. Plans
for new membership were taken up for the second
semester. Mr. Dahlstrom of the English Department
led an open discussion on "Engineers and Citizenship."
A short film was presented at the meeting for the mem-
bers.

PHI LAMBDA UPSILON DECIDES ON AWARDS
At a business meeting held on Thursday. January 16,
Phi Lambda Upsilon, Honorary Chemical Society, ar-
rived at some decisions which are of interest to all
chemistry students. After transacting some preliminary
business a report from the committee on awards was
called for. This committee was divided into two sec-
tions, of which one section was responsible for the
consideration of awards to Chemical Engineering stu-
dents, while the other section concerned itself with
awards for science students taking chemistry. The first
committee suggested that a Perry's "Handbook for
Chemical Engineers" would be suitable for the Junior
engineer, because this book is indispensable to a Chem-
ical Engineer. For chemistry students of the Literary
College, a book from Taylor's Physical Series, an Or-
ganic text book, or an Analytical Chemistry text book
were suggested. These suggestions were made into a
motion and accepted. The award will be given at the
initiation banquet to be held this spring.
o
CHEMICALS HEAR INTERESTING TALK
Thursday evening, January 17. Mr. S. D. Kirkpat-
rick, editor of Chemical and Metallurgical Engineering,
addressed the student group on "Trends in the Chemi-
cal Engineering Industries and Professions." After a
short discussion of professional matters connected with
the Institute, Mr. Kirkpatrick gave a very good survey
of the present chemical engineering field. He described
both single details, such as new uses for sulphuric and
muriatic acids, and general trends of the profession,
like the growing movement toward decentralization in
certain classes of industries.
CLASSES VISIT DETROIT PLANT
About sixty members of the Metal Processing 4
classes made an afternoon trip to the Cadillac Motor
Car Company at Detroit, on Monday, January 21. Prof.
Boston, Head of the Department, and class instructors
accompanied the students on an insertion tour of the
plant. It was their privilege to see in operation the
new line system of production.
The first impression received was one of confusion.
Closer observation convinced the students, however,
that greater efficiency was obtained by placing the
machines, regardless of type, in their proper sequence
of operation in this type of plant, rather than conform
to the old method of segmenting a shop into inde-
pendent but correlated machining units. The trip
proved valuable, not only in showing the industrial ap-
plications of the machining processes learned, but also
in giving an introduction to the complicated field of
production planning.

A reporter for a metropolitan daily asked a number of persons on the street, "What
is the biggest buy for a nickel?" Two-thirds promptly replied, "A telephone call."
^■A Americans throughout the country evidently agree
A with this judgment of value received from the telephone.
For each day they hold more than 57,000,000 conversa-

Year after year Bell System planning extends the tele-
phone's reach—increases its speed—makes it more con-
venient, more valuable to everybody.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN EGYPT
The student chapter of A.S.C.E. sponsored a talk on
the above subject, presented by Prof. Arthur Boak.
Chairman of the Department of History. The Univer-
sity of Michigan has maintained an expedition south of
Cairo. Egypt, since 1924 in order to throw light on the
history of Egypt when it was a province of Rome dur-
ing the years 300 B.C. to 640 A.D. Prof. Boak gave
an interesting description of the causes relating to the
fine state of preservation of the villages which are now
being excavated and studied. One village is on the
north side of Lake Karoun, a salt water lake 130 feet
below sea level, while the other is off the south shore
at the site of Karanis.
A modern expedition has a minimum of four special-
ly trained men, who take charge of over 100 native
workmen, many of whom are already trained in digging
for valuable archaeological finds. A base camp is
necessary for the successful operation of the expedi-
tion and for the housing of the men and many laborers.
This, of course, requires that an adequate food supply
must be nearby and that pure water must be available.
The Nile River is the only source of water in Egypt
and must be purified in order to be palatable.
A complete record of the findings of the expedition
is kept, both for historical purposes and for checking
by the Egyptian government which has given the con-
cession to the University of Michigan. Maps are drawn
of the site as the earth and sand are removed, and
photographs are taken of all valuable articles in their
position as found by the workmen. Over 90 per cent
of the articles have been transported to Ann Arbor,
where they may be seen in Newberry Hall on State
Street. Many things are stored in Angel I Hall; the
basement of Hill Auditorium is nearly tilled with Egyp-
tian pottery: and the Library has charge of the Papy-
rus used nearly twenty centuries ago.
Mr. R. A. Kirkpatrick, graduate of the University
of Iowa Law School, gave a combined lecture on Febru-
ary 13 in Natural Science Auditorium. He spoke on
Bou'der Dam and on the National Parks of which the
(irand Canyon and the Zion National are the most
noted. Mr. Kirkpatrick is the corresponding editor of
the National Geographic Magazine and is a member of
the Advisory Council of the Isaak Walton League of
America on National Parks.
Of interest to Civil Engineers who are contemplating
on joining the local chapter is the announcement that
the Spring Initiation will be held Thursday. March 14.
The unusual cover cut on the January issue of the

HERE'S HOW—the framework of the light weight, streamlined rail c-ars
for high speed is Lindewelded from chrome-molybdenum steel lulling.
Mastery over all Metals
Welding Makes Jointless Structures Possible in
Practically All Commercial Metals and Alloys
By A. B. KINZEL*
One great advantage of using
welding is that practically every
commercially available metal and
alloy can be made by this means
into a Jointless assembly.
Contributes to Home
Comforts
Numerous articles fabricated
by welding are found in most
homes. Familiar ones cover a
wide range of metals—kitchen
ware and furniture of aluminum,
copper and stainless steel; copper
tubing in refrigerators, sheet
metal in refrigerator boxes;
kitchen cabinets and gas ranges;
.vater pipes of copper, brass, iron
and steel; furnaces and hot water
tanks of strong heat-resisting
irons and steels. Even the tiny
alloy wire elements in radio
tubes are welded.
Simplifies Automobile
Maintenance
Automobile manufacturers use
welding for innumerable assem-
blies where your safety and com-
fort depend on permanent strength
and tightness. The modern auto-
mobile repair man also uses weld-
ing. With welding he quickly re-
stores broken parts to use again.
Steel bumpers, fenders, frames are
readily made Jointless by weld-
ing—as strong as or stronger than
the original piece. Cracked cylin-
der blocks and broken aluminum
crank cases are welded. Valves
and valve seats are made service
free by welding a thin coating of
Haynes Stellite to the wearing
surfaces to give longer life and
added thousands of low cost miles.
Aids Industrial Users
In industry — for tanks, con-
tainers, piping and a wide variety
of other machinery and equip-
ment of all sizes, shapes and
metals—the use of welding is
even more extensive.
Welding Marches Ahead
The wide-spread use of weld-
ing for various metals and alloys
has been due largely to constant
advances in technique and mate-
rials. Typical among these is the
development of Lindewelding, a
procedure for the rapid welding
of steel pipe and plate. Speed in-
creases of 50 to 65 per cent and
material savings of 25 to 50 per
cent over previous methods have
been made.
Bronze-welding, welding with
a bronze welding rod, is widely
used for both repair and produc-
tion. Smooth joining of metals or
alloys of different compositions
can be accomplished by bronze-
welding. Steel can be bronze-
welded to cast iron, bronze and
copper can be joined, brass and
steel plate can be united.
Makes Modern Metal Designs
Jointless
Exact procedures for the weld-
ing of corrosion-resistant steels
and alloys have been developed.
Welds so made are sound, strong
and ductile. Resistance of the
welded joint to corrosion makes
it valuable also for use in joining
special alloys such as Monel
Metal and Everdur. Welded alu-
minum alloy chairs, tables and
other furniture have been made
possible through the develop-
ment of special aluminum weld-
ing rods.

you that there are jobs we give you the following:
During the past year the Keeler Brass Company
of Grand Rapids has employed a number of Michi-
gan grads. John Allen, Ira McAdam, Rowland
Black, John Raum, and William VanLoo are now
employed by this company.
Also recognizing the abilities of our grads, the
A.C. Spark Plug Company of Flint has hired a num-
ber of the men of '34. John Goetz, William Scott,
Jack Bates, Wesley McMullen, and Cecil Waldo
have found places here.
We still have with us a number of '34s. Among
those taking graduate courses we find Donald New-
hall, Charles Duerr, Eugene Wasielewski, E. A.
Webber, Carl W. Nelson, V. C. Williams, Lloyd
Hilbert, Leonard Fines, and Joseph Frank.
The influence of last year's graduates is felt as
far east as Schenectady where we find a large con-
tingent of outstanding men; Harold Hessler, Fred
Kohl, Walter Mikelson, Francis Headley, George
Leland, and J. R. Mclntyre. And then again at
Erie, Pa., is none other than Kenneth G. Roe.

HEATING WITH COLD WATER
Reversible air-conditioning equipment, which may
be adapted U&gt; either healing or cooling, de|&gt;cnding on
the season, is now in operation in a new building in
Salem, J\. J.
Reversing the cycle of the ordinary household
refrigerator, the refrigerant absorbs heat from the
water of a well which is at least 52 degrees even in
coldest weather. This heat is added to that created
by the work of the electrically driven compressors,
and the refrigerant at 135 degrees gives up the total
heat to the air of the building. Thus it is possible
for an expenditure in electric energy equivalent to
100 heat units to obtain a total of 300 or 400 units
for heating. Physics students will recognize this
system as the heat pump.
During the summer, the process is reversed. The
heat is absorbed from the air of the building. Then
this heat and the heat from the compressors is dis-
sipated in the water from the well, which then can
be used for bathing, or washing dishes.
The building is completely equipped for year-round
air conditioning. Besides heating and cooling, the
equipment automatically controls the humidity,
and cleans and circulates the air. The engineering and
the planning for the installation were done by
engineers of the American Gas and Electric Company
and the General Electric Company, and the equip-
ment was built and installed bv General Electric.
FLEA-POWER MOTOR
New photoelectric cells, recently developed in the
General Electric Research Laboratory, furnish
enough energy to operate a tiny electric motor rated
at four tcii-millionths of a horsepower.
These "cells" differ from photoelectric "lubes" in
that the cells convert light energy into electric
energy, whereas phototubes do not themselves
generate electricity but instead control the amount
of current permitted to flow through them according
to the amount of light they receive. The cells are of
the selenium type, the selenium being coated with a
film of platinum so thin as to be semitransparent.
Four of the cells arc used to ojteratc the motor,
which in direct sunlight turns at about 400 rpm.
Hut enough light energy is converted into electricity,
when a 75-watt incandescent lamp is lighted eight
inches away from the cells, to turn the motor at
good speed, using three ten-thousandths of an am-
pere. One watt of power can be obtained from about
15 square feet of cell area in direct sunlight.
Dr. C. W. Hewlett, North Carolina State, '06,
Ph. D., Johns Hopkins, '12, of the Research Labora-
tory was in charge of investigations that led to the
development of the cells and the tiny motor.
GREEN BLUES
When the G-E "House of Magic" was exhibited at
the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia not long ago,
the cathode-ray oscillograph was one of the most
popular features. This device, as you undoubtedly
know, shows the wave shape of any sound, music,
speech, or just plain noise—in the form of a moving,
pale greenish-blue line on the end of the tube.
Rubinoff, the well-known radio violinist and
orchestra leader, came down to see how his violin
notes looked in the device. J le had only a few mo-
ments in between engagements. Hut be became so
interested after watching the gyrations of the
dancing green line when he played "Ilumoresque"
that he stayed for half an hour. He played on, and
found that his violin produced green notes—even
when he played the blues.
R. II. Mighell, U. of Denver, '29, of the G-E
Research Laboratory, was in charge of the exhibit.

IN THIS ISSUE
On March 28. Dean Emeritus M. E.
Cooley will be 80 years old. We dedi-
cate this issue to "The Grand Old Man
of the Engineering College" with an
article on his achievements during his
long years of service to the College and
the engineering profession. Beneath the
picture of the Dean in the frontispiece
is a poem written by him which truly
reflects his philosophy.
Dr. B. F. Bailey, head of the Electrical
Engineering Department, writes on "Mich-
igan's Electrical Pioneers." Charles F.
Brush and John W. Langley. These two
University graduates played important
parts in the development of the applica-
tions of electricity. Dr. Bailey's article
gives an accurate description of their
accomplishments.
T. Hawley Tapping, Alumni Secretary,
has contributed an interesting article on
the functions of the Association. Mr.
Tapping stresses the point that the effi-
cient functioning of the Association is
due chiefly to the interest and loyalty
of the alumni. This, he states, is truly
a Michigan tradition.
Of special interest to our Chemical
grads and undergrads is the rollicking
poem about a wellknown prof, written
by a group of very anonymous students
This tops off the "Stresses and Strains,"
which we endorse as exceptionally good.
Five more outstanding seniors are ex-
posed by our "Inquiring Reporter." This
month's victims are Tage jacobson, Al
Mortenson. Eric Sommer, Russ Houvener,
and Les Colwell.
NEXT MONTH
Professor C T. Olmsted has promised
to come through with another article
containing interesting advice. This arti-
cle is to be a continuation of his article
in the January issue on "State Registra-
tion for Engineers" It will give more
specific information about the examina-
tions and may include some sample ques-
tion.
Rudy Thoren, senior Aero, writes on
transport flying through the stratosphere,
on which Wiley Post has been experi-
menting. A new plan for engineering
club rooms will be presented by Eric

THE STEEDS OF TIME
The Steeds of Time course on. No flick of spurs,
Nor curb of bits, can change their rhythmic stride.
The silent hoofs of these staid voyageurs
Turn not aside upon their cosmic ride.
No mortal mind can think, nor tongue can say,
How long the Steeds of Time have trod the way;
Nor whence they came, nor where their quest may lie.
But hoof-prints in the sky point out their path
Along the Milky Way; past coal-sacks wrapt
In deepest mystery; through nebulae
So faint no human eye can classify
The dappled flecks as stars. And yet each speck
Is but a tally-mark of aeons lapsed
Since Chaos saw the Steeds of Time pass by.
M. E. Cooley
Ann Arbor, Michigan
January, 1933.


Mortimer E.
HILLARD A. SUTIN,
March 28. 1855, was an important day in the his-
tory of the University of Michigan and its Engineering
College. It was on this day tlxat Mortimer E. Cooley,
the "Grand Old Man" of the College of Engineering,
first saw the light of day on a farm near Canandaigua,
New York. His influence on the engineering college
has been so profound that the college has expanded
and progressed continuously under his careful direc-
tion, and under the principles he laid down. Dean
Cooley and the college matured together. They are each
a product of the other. The greatness of one has
reflected itself on the other, until they have become
so interlocked that it is hardly conceivable to think of
them apart.
His list of accomplishments at Michigan hardly
need lie mentioned: they are obvious. He built the
College of Engineering from a rough temporary shop
with floor space amounting to 1720 sq. ft., to three
large excellently equipped buildings having at total of
some 500,000 sq. ft. of floor space; from three to
four courses taught by two instructors, to hundreds
of courses taught by a staff of more than 160 pro-
fessors, instructors, and assistants; from an enrollment
of less than 30, to an enrollment of more than 1800.
These are but a few of the stories of progress which
indicate the energy, ability, and the devotion of the man
at the helm. His administration, with unrivaled de-
fiance, even threw a scare into the Literary College.
Not only did the enrollment of the Engineering Col-
lege pass that of the Medical and Law schools, but in
37E
addition, threatened the record of the Literary college.
Professor Goulding, who was then Secretary of the
College of Engineering, relates how Cooley, with his
characteristic chuckle, exclaimed, "By Jove, Goulding,
we'll pass them yet."* And they almost did.
Cooley, after attending Canandaigua Academy, was
a teacher in a rural school near home. At nineteen he
took examinations for entrance to the United States
Naval Academy, and was admitted as a midshipman.
Upon his first trip to Anna]&gt;olis, to take the examin-
ations, he met Ira X. Hollis, also taking them, and
the two became friends—a friendship that was intimate
and enduring for the many years until Dr. Hollis's
death. Dean Cooley's only son, now a Captain in
the U. S. Navy, is named Hollis Cooley.
After he was graduated from the Academy in 1878,
Cooley shipped as Cadet Engineer, seeing considerable
of the world, and gaining practical experience. In
1881 the Navy Department, authorized by law, de-
tailed him as Ensign, USN, to the University of
Michigan as Professor of Steam Engineering and Iron
Shipbuilding. Cooley at this time was 26 years old,
and has the distinction of being the youngest full pro-
fessor in the history of Michigan education.
When Cooley came to Michigan, the field of Me-
chanical Engineering was new. so the whole develop-
ment of this important field came under his personal
direction. He was given a little shanty costing $1500
in which to display his wares, at that time consisting
of Blacksmithing, Machine Shop, and Pattemmaking.
At the end of four years, the University invited him
to stay, and the Navy consented to accept his resig-
nation.
In 1904, he became Dean of the College of Engin-
eering and Architecture. His policy was conservative
and thoughtful. He never adopted new measures
rashly, but always weighed the ideas carefully to dis-
cern their true value. Naturally his work has been
constructive. He founded the colleges firmly and
logically.
The Alumni always turned to his office to be greeted
by a genial smile, a cigar, and a chat in one of those
*"Jove" is not a particularly characteristic exclamation of
Dean Cooley. part of his inimitable reputation being founded
upon the firm ground of his ability to swear in good sailor
fashion, and still ever to remain a gentleman.

Dean Cooley retired, in 1928. with the ultimate satis-
faction of the University teacher warming the cockles
of his heart: with the affection and loyaltv of thousands
of engineers, his pupils and friends all over the world.
He has a further satisfaction in the knowledge that
he has left a definite impress upon the whole develop-
ment of engineering education during the past fifty
years.
For many years as a Consulting Engineer, particu-
larly in the appraisal of properties of public service
corporations. Dean Cooley played an important part
in the development of industry in the state and in the
nation at large. The list of corporations, municipal-
ities, and governmental departments that he has served
is a long one. He was, from 1907 to 1912, Chairman
of the Block Signal and Train Control Board of the
Interstate Commerce Commission; he was a member
of the Advisory Council of the Joint Commission on
Postal Service. He has been called as an expert wit-
ness in innumerable important patent cases. His most
recent notable valuation work was that of Neutral
Arbitrator, by appointment of the Interstate Com-
merce Commission, in connection with the New York
Central Railroad's purchase of the Michigan Central
Railroad Lines. Dean Cooley is, at eighty, still serving
the Federal and State Governments. In August, 1933,
he was ap]K&gt;inted State Engineer, in charge of the
Federal Emergency Administration of Public Works
program for the State of Michigan. In this capacity
he has added further laurels to an imposing record
of service.
Among the distinctions that have come to Dean
Cooley, was the national Presidency of engineering
societies, including The American Society of Mechan-
ical Engineers, The American Society of Civil En-
gineers, Federated American Engineering Societies
(now the American Engineering Council), and others.
He has also served as Mayor of Ann Arbor, and in
1924 was Democratic candidate for the United States
Senate. During the Spanish-American War, Dean
Cooley again served in the Navy, as Chief Engineer
on the U. S. S. Yosemite, which was manned largely
by graduates of the University. During the World
War, he was Educational Director of the 7th District
of Student Army Training Corps, which included the
states of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Illinois.
Dean Cooley has been honored by various colleges,
including the degree of Mechanical Engineer from
Michigan. 1895; L.L.D., from Michigan State College,
1907; Doctor of Engineering, University of Nebraska.
1911; Doctor of Science, University of Michigan,
1928. In 1930 he was the recipient of The Washing-
ton Award, given by the Western Society of Engineers
upon the recommendation of all the national engi-
neering societies, and generally conceded to be the out-
standing recognition possible for an American Engineer.
This year he received a medal, presented at a dinner
at the Detroit Athletic Club on Lincoln's Birthday,
for fifty years of Service in The American Society of
Mechanical Engineers.
During his lifetime. Cooley has been a strong ad-
vocate of conservation. From his experience, he saw
that conservation and engineering were inter-related.
It was this foresight that caused him to write and to
campaign for conservation long before our more
modern popular clamor for conservation was heard.
He has long been of the opinion that there should be
a six-year course in engineering—two years of which
would be devoted to the teaching of cultural subjects.
He has the feeling that the Engineering profession
should require at least as much background and train-
ing as either Medicine or Law.
It was largely due to the efforts of Dean Cooley
that the Engineering Exhibits have become so im-
portant a function of the College of Engineering.
These exhibits have drawn thousands to Michigan, and
have been most instrumental in popularizing the en-
gineering college and the University. Moreover, they
have given the students, who run the exhibits com-
pletely, an opportunity to express themselves. In line
with their motto, "Ask us questions—that's what we're
here for," even Dean Cooley admits having been en-
lightened on certain subjects. Nobody has ever been
able to determine what these subjects were!
In 1919, the Department of Engineering Research
was suggested. Dean Cooley was quick to see the
benefits to be derived from cooperation between the
University and the industrial and technical interests
of the State along scientific lines. He helped make the
advantages of this Department clear. Since its start,
it has increased the staff of the College of Engineering
by bringing leading engineers and scientists from all

have improved, and because of these very facts, it lias
greatly enhanced the opportunities for scientific study
and research work on the part of undergraduate
and graduate students.
A most remarkable tribute to the personality of
Dean Cooley was paid at a Testimonial Dinner given
him November 23, 1923, at the Hotel Statler in Detroit.
Over five hundred former students and later friends
gathered in Detroit. Among the guests were college
presidents, deans, department heads, officers of rail-
roads, bankers, attorneys, regents, presidents of na-
tional engineering societies, and friends dating from
his earliest days at Michigan. Among the speakers
was a former governor of Michigan, a Justice of the
Supreme Court, and an Admiral of the United States
Navy. Friends came from the Atlantic Coast, from
west of the Mississippi, and from south of the Mason
Dixon Line, to pay their tribute of admiration and af-
fection. Acting Mayor Lodge extended the welcome
of the City of Detroit to the guests who had come to
pay honor to one who had rendered many important
services to Detroit and its citizens, and to the guest
of honor he presented the freedom of the City. Dr.
Ira N. Hollis, life-long friend of Dean Cooley, and
then President of Worcester Polytechnic Institute, told
innumerable stories of the Naval Academy days when,
as he said. Dean Cooley always got by with his smile.
Hollis had been graduated first in their Class of 1878
at the Naval Academy: Dean Cooley was seventh.
Among other talks, P. N. Moore, of St. Louis, gave
a brief outline of the work Dean Cooley had done as
President of the Federated American Engineering
Societies, an organization of over 50,000 engineers
dedicated to the service of the community, the State,
and the Nation. Dean Cooley succeeded Herbert
Hoover as National President of this organization.
In preparing this article about Dean Cooley, we
join in the sentiment of late President Burton, who
spoke at this Testimonial Dinner. He expressed the
hopelessness of condensing the many years of service
into ten minutes of talk, and in closing his remarks,
said, "You didn't come here tonight because Dean
Cooley is a scholar, or a teacher, or a great Engineer,
but because he is a human being, and you love him be-
cause he stands as a living illustration of what America
means—unstifled, individual initiative."
Dean Cooley, through his long years of service,
has come to be, in a very true sense, a representative
of the whole University. His spirit and vitality are
now conspicuous by his absence from Ann Arbor.
His connections with the University cannot be ex-
plained merely by duties and responsibilities. His is
an innate connection which can only be explained by
love, and devotion to a task into which he flung all
his energies.
The College of Engineering and the diversity of
Michigan will stand forever as a living memorial to
this man whose remarkable qualities caused even the
older professors to label him "the best of the clan,"
and the hundreds of students whom he has known,
to sj&gt;eak of him always as "The Grand Old Man of
Michigan."
The West Engineering Building rep-
resents the first landmark in Dean
Cooley's constructive program at
Michigan. About 1895 an increase in
registration made increased facilities
imperative. C. E. Greene, the Dean
of the College of Engineering, was
asked to draw up plans for a new
building. He suggested a small U
shaped affair, costing about $50,000.
However, before his plans could be
acted upon, he died and was succeed-
ed by Cooley. Merely as a matter
of form, Cooley was asked his stand
on the building program. He replied,
"Gentlemen, if you could but see the
other engineering colleges with which
we are forced to compete, you would
not hesitate for one moment to ap-
propriate a quarter of a million dol-
lars." They did; this building was the
result.
It is significant that almost upon its
completion it was necessary to add
about one hundred feet to the north
end of the building. This photograph
is an old-timer—smoke coming from
the chimney shows the present
R.O.T.C. Building which was then the
Power House.

An Architect's Sketch of the New Engineering Building
In 1926 plans were drawn for a large new building to house all of
the shops and laboratories. As pictured, the building was to ex-
tend down to South University St. and across Church St. to Forest
Ave. The main entrance is shown facing Church St. The present
East Engineering Building is the central portion of the side along
East University Ave. (the left side in the sketch).
Michigan's
Electrical Pioneers
DR. BENJAMIN F. BAILEY
Head of Department of Electrical Engineering
During the past 60 years two events have had a tre-
mendous influence upon the progress of civilization—
I refer to the World War and to the development of
the applications of electricity. I need hardly elaborate
upon the fact that of the two the latter has had the
more far reaching consequences.
In 1875 electricity had only two important appli-
cations—the mariner's compass and telegraphy. The
next 25 years saw the invention and application of the
telephone, electric lighting, electric power, X-rays and
radio. These have so transformed our civilization that
it is impossible for younger people to realize the
changes that have taken place, despite the fact that all
this has occurred within the memory of many living
men. Without these developments we should have no
telephones, electric light and power, X-rays or radio,
and, in addition, our present tall buildings, our auto-
mobiles, our airplanes and various other commonplace
developments would have been impossible.
In this development two Michigan men, Charles F.
Brush and John W. Langley, played important parts
and it seems fitting that the Michigan Technic
should publish a permanent record of their achieve-
ments.
In 1875 engineers were beginning to consider the
possibility of electric lighting. The electric arc had been
known for a number of years and even incandescent
lamps in a very crude form had been invented but not
developed commercially. The great obstacle to electric
lighting was the so-called "subdivision of the electric
light." Arc lamps had been used commercially in the
operation of lighthouses but always with one electric
generator supplying the current to one lamp. Nobody
knew how to devise a system such that a number of
lamps could be supplied by one generator and any one
of them could be turned on or off without interfering
in any way with the others. The problem seems simple
to us but at that time many eminent physicists believed
that a solution was impossible.
As is usually the case when many men turn their
attention to a problem, a way was found; in fact, in
this case, two solutions were proposed. One was to
One Hundred Six
March, 1935
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


way that the two conductors leading from it would be
kept at a constant difference of potential. If this could
be done each lighting unit could be designed for this
potential and could then be connected across the wires
without inter ferring with the other units. This method
is now in almost universal use.
About 1875 another solution was proposed, namely,
that the dynamo should be so regulated that the current
would remain constant but the voltage would be caused
to vary, depending upon how many lamps were inserted
in the circuit. This is a constant current system in
contrast to the other which is a constant potential
system. At the time mentioned this seemed a suitable
solution, and, in fact, it was widely used until com-
paratively recent years. The two men in whom we are
interested in this article both contributed to its develop-
ment. This system was particularly applicable to arc
lighting and the Brush arc system was developed and
was in commercial use as early as 1878, whereas the
first real central station operated on the constant poten-
tial system was started in New York City by Thomas
Edison in 1882.
In 1875 John W. Langley had just been appointed
Professor of Chemistry and Physics in the University
of Michigan. He was 34 years of age at the time and
had graduated from the University in 1861. Later he
studied in the Medical School of the University and
received an honorable M.D. After graduating he had
been an Acting Assistant Surgeon in the U.S. Navy,
Assistant Professor of Physics at the United States
Naval Academy and Professor of Chemistry in the
Western University of Pennsylvania. Charles F. Brush
was 8 years younger than I.angley and graduated from
the University in 1869. These two men apparently
first met in 1875 and our story really starts from that
meeting.
When these two men met in Ann Arbor in 1875 Dr.
Langley had become interested in arc lighting and had
apparently formulated some opinions as to the best
methods to be used in making it practicable. He talked
The Brush Generator
The Langley Generator
this work over with Mr. Brush and apparently it was
this conversation which started Brush upon his dis-
tinguished career. Langley always claimed that he
should have received a great deal more credit than he
did for his part in the development of the series arc
lighting system. At this late date it is obviously im-
possible to formulate any accurate opinion as to the
justice of these claims.
The problem which Brush and Langley attempted to
solve involved many difficulties some of which they
undoubtedly did not appreciate when they started work.
The greatest difficulty is the fact that the carbon arc
is inherently unstable. In the case of an ordinary re-
sistor, such as an iron wire or an incandescent lamp,
if we wish to get more current we must apply more
voltage. With the electric arc, however, the larger
the current the less voltage is needed so that if we
attempt to supply an arc at a constant potential either
the current will immediately rise to an enormous value
or the arc will go out. The difficulty was cleverly
solved by so designing the generator that the larger
the current the lower the voltage: thus matching the
characteristics of the generator with those of the arc.
Both the Langley and the Brush generators were of the
series wound type. If we drive such a generator at a
constant speed and gradually increase the current taken
from it by decreasing the external resistance, the volt-
age and current will at first rise together and nearly
in proportion to one another. As we increase the cur-
rent, however, the voltage rises more and more slowly
and finally if the current is made large enough the
voltage decreases. Ultimately it will become zero when
the external resistance is zero. By making a machine
with enough internal reaction this current, even on
short circuit, can be limited to a safe value and by-
operating the machine with a comparatively low resis-
tance in circuit we can obtain the desired characteristics,

increased current. In this way the combination of the
arc light and the generator can be made stable. If the
current tends to increase in the arc the voltage of the
generator decreases and checks the tendency, and on the
other hand if the current in the arc tends to decrease,
the voltage of the generator rises and prevents the arc
from extinguishing itself. Whether this clever solution
was due to Brush or to Langley or to someone else
is not clear from the records available.
The design of the mechanism of the arc lamp pre-
sented many difficulties and there is no doubt that
Brush contributed more than any other man to its de-
sign and invention. The requirements are not easily
met. The two carbon rods must be in contact when the
lamp is extinguished, otherwise current could not pass
over the gap to start the arc, the voltage being insuffi-
cient to cause the current to jump through even a very
short air gap. When the arc is in normal operation
the carbons should be kept a constant distance apart.
If this distance varies the light will flicker. The carbons
must be automatically fed toward one another since they
burn away at the rate of about one inch per hour. In
case it should happen that the lamp is kept burning until
all of the carbon is consumed it is necessary to provide
some automatic method of short circuiting the carbons
in order to prevent all of the lamps in the circuit from
being extinguished. Brush was apparently the first
inventor to develop a simple and successful method of
accomplishing all these objects.
It lias been pointed out that Brush used a generator
which tended by inherent regulation to keep the cur-
rent constant. He made the regulation still better, how-
ever, by shunting the series field of his generator with
a rheostat consisting of a pile of carbon blocks. These
were pressed together by the plunger of a solenoid
whose winding was inserted in the main circuit. If the
current tended to rise slightly the pressure exerted on
the blocks increased, more current was diverted from
the field and the voltage of the generator was reduced.
thus preventing any appreciable increase of current.
It must be remembered that all this work was done
at a time when very little was known about electricity.
Even suitable measuring instruments were not available.
The best current measuring device, for example, was
the so-called tangent galvonometer. This consisted
merely of a compass needle in the center of a coil of
wire, the current being proportional to the tangent of
the angle by which the needle was deflected. To over-
come all the inherent difficulties at such a time and with
such meager equipment was a very brilliant accom-
plishment. The accompanying cut shows the appearance
of the Brush generator.
The Brush system was commercially introduced in
New York City in 1878 and was an important factor
in electric lighting for many years thereafter. This
system was, however, ultimately superseded by the con-
stant potential system. There were several reasons for
this. Gradually, incandescent lamps were improved until
they were equal or superior to the arc in efficiency.
Also it was found impossible or impracticable to make
arcs giving a small amount of light such as is necessary
in house lighting. A standard arc, for example, gives
about 2,000 candle power which is entirely too much
for many purposes. A third difficulty lay in the fact
that the current used was about 10 amperes and each
arc required about 50 volts. Since the arcs were oper-
ated in series, 100 arc lamps required about 5,000
volts. On account of insulation difficulties it was found
impracticable to go much farther than this. The maxi-
mum output of an arc generator was therefore only
about 50 kilowatts. Today generators of 50,000 kilo-
watts and larger are common. We can faintly imagine
the added complication and cost that would result if
we attempted to replace each of our 50,000 kilowatt
units with 1000 Brush arc machines. Moreover, great
difficulties were encountered in attempting to operate
motors on constant current systems. Suitable motors
were produced and used but it was necessary to equip
them with mechanical governors. They were constantly

inherently self-governing.
After the successful introduction of the arc system
Brush turned his attention to the storage battery. Up
to that time the lead plates of the storage battery had
been formed by repeatedly charging and discharging
a battery consisting of plain lead plates in a solution of
sulphuric acid. Ultimately a layer of sponge lead was
formed on one plate and one of lead peroxide on the
other. Brush conceived the idea of the pasted plate in
which the active material was spread upon perforated
lead plates. This process made possible a much cheaper
and lighter battery and is in universal use today.
Brush's work received wide recognition. He became
a Chevalier of the Legion of Honor in France in 1881
and received the Rumford Medal in 1899. He also
received many honorary degrees, including the degree
of LL.D. from Western Reserve University in 1900
and the degree of Doctor of Science from the Univer-
sity of Michigan in 1912.
The University possesses two of the early dynamos
built by Dr. Langley. The first and larger one he ap-
parently built with his own hands in 1876. It was de-
signed for a current of 18 to 20 amperes. Our former
Associate Dean, Professor George W. Patterson, who
knew Dr. Langley well, left the following note re-
garding this machine:
"An interesting feature of this machine is the com-
nuitating brush arrangement. The brushes were made
of spring brass, as carbon brushes had not been in-
vented. The commutator is of the spiral type with one
end of each commutator segment about opposite the
other end of the adjoining segment. To keep down
sparking a second brush was put on which trailed be-
hind the main brush and was left to break the circuit
when the commutator segment pulled away from the
main brush. To reduce arcing at the second brush, it
was connected to the main brush through a small re-
sistance which cut down the current before it was
broken. The brushes were adjustable for the best com-
mutation. This machine is practically complete as it
now stands, and would require only minor repairs to
put it in operation."
At the time this machine was built Dr. Langley
claimed that it was the largest arc light generator in
the world. No other could supply more than one arc
light while this could supply two. The appearance of
the, macWne is shown in the accompanying cut.
The second machine was built by an Ann Arbor com-
pany in 1877. In it, however, the commutator is not
of the spiral type and only single brushes are used. It is
a source of regret that the writer has not been able to
obtain more detailed information regarding just what
Dr. Langley did. In 1892 Dr. Langley left the Uni-
versity and became Professor of Electrical Engineering
in the Case School of Applied Science where he de-
veloped one of the very early departments of electrical
engineering. In 1892 this University conferred upon
him the honorary degree of Ph.D.
Considerable material has been published relative to
the work of Mr. Brush but apparently the work of
Dr. Langley was unnoticed at the time, at least no
printed record seems to be available. Dr. Langley lived
in Ann Arbor for several years after his retirement
and was quite well known to some of us. What little is
said here is the result of conversations between Dr.
Langley and the writer.
It is hoped that these brief notes may serve to pre-
serve in permanent form some of the impressions of
men now living who have had personal contact with
these two distinguished scientists and inventors. They
are gone but their accomplishments will live forever.
MEMORIAM
Arthur Will. '36 E
The death of Art Will on March 8 was a disturbing loss to the Engineering school, the
Michigan Technic, and to those of us who were his friends at the University of Michigan.
After struggling valiantly for six weeks against the effects of a ruptured appendix, Art suc-
cumbed to the illness. His cheerful disposition and friendliness made of him a fine com-
panion, while his intelligent capacity for knowledge and his industrious nature combined to
make him one of the most promising students of the school. His scholastic record was one
of which to be justly proud.
Entering here in the fall of 1932, he soon distinguished himself as an outstanding mem-
ber of his class. He was widely known even outside of his class, and a member of Phi Eta
Sigma. This was but a stepping stone to his future accomplishments. He became a mem-
ber of Triangles Junior Honorary Society, and Articles Editor of the Michigan Technic. His
characteristic efficiency was extended into the realms of the Glider Club of which he was
an outstanding member. He was also the holder of a student's pilot license. Had he lived
he would have become the Managing Editor of the Michigan Technic for the coming year,
the highest position on the staff.
As we write these lines, a feeling of emptiness overwhelms us. He was a young man who
had wonderful promise of success in engineering; one whose memory will be sincerely cher-
ished by his friends at the University, and it will be a long time before another such a one
comes to take his place in the hearts of those who knew him.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Michigan's Alumni
Really Function
T. HAWLEY TAPPING
General Secretary of The Alumni Association
Tradition plays a most important role in the history
and in the everyday routine of any great university.
It is the background against which both students and
faculty live and work. It might easily be stated that
tradition is the soul of a university.
In the more than one hundred years of her history,
the University of Michigan has built up a great body
of tradition. A fine type of undergraduate democracy,
scholastic attainment in many fields of research and
teaching, worldwide recognition of the calibre of its
outstanding teachers, and—to get directly to the subject
of this sketch—an alumni loyalty which is everywhere
recognized as unusual, are just a few of the "Michigan
Traditions" which have endured through the years.
Far back in the last century—in 1845, to be exact
—there was launched The Society of The Alumni.
Its members were the graduates of the first class to
receive diplomas from the University of Michigan
at Ann Arbor. That was the beginning of many
decades of an alumni attention to Michigan which has
become increasingly manifest and productive as suc-
cessive generations have carried on the "tradition''
of alumni loyalty to Alma Mater. It is safe to say
that today, wherever university alumni gather, tribute,
somewhat envious, will be paid to the spirit shown by
Michigan men and women toward their University.
Harvard University men, justly proud of their own
reputation for interest in that great University at
Cambridge, Illinois University men, California Uni-
versity men, all readily admit that Michigan alumni
are volubly and intelligently loyal to Ann Arbor.
Even the undergraduate, naturally but little touched
by what goes on in the alumni world, recognizes the
force and the import of the great body of graduates
and former students. Not an unimportant proof of
this attitude of attention is the request by the Editor
of The Teclmic that this article be prepared.
In the Alumni Association of the University of
Michigan Michigan's sons and daughters have been
organized for many years. This Association is the
successor of that Society formed ninety years ago. In
its present form, it was chartered in 1897, and it made
into a single homogeneous group the departmental
alumni bodies which had been produced from the
framework of the Society of The Alumni. It has
pioneered in many phases of alumni work, with the
result that today the Michigan plan is being copied
by sister universities and colleges, and Michigan's
alumni officials are often called into consultation for
help and advice. In the affairs of The American
Alumni Council, the national association of alumni
secretaries, Michigan has been called upon to take a
leading role. Wilfred B. Shaw, General Secretary
of the Alumni Association for twenty-five years—
from 1904 to 1929—was the first President of this
Council.
In its mechanics the Alumni Association operates
under a very simple plan. It lias its Board of Di-
rectors of twenty-two men and women, chosen on a
distinctly representative basis. Twelve of them are
elected by the University of Michigan Clubs scattered
in all corners of the world.
The Alumnae Chapters, of which there are ap-
proximately forty, select two members of the Board.
The Alumni Classes name three Directors to repre-
sent them on the Directorate. Three Directors-at-
Large are chosen at the mass meeting of alumni held
at each Ann Arbor reunion. And, finally, a Past
President of the Alumni Association is a Director
for life.
The Board of Directors elects the officers and
the executive staff of the Association and directs the

alysis, is the simple framework into which Michigan's
widespread alumni activity is fitted. It works. It
gives to its members, no matter where located or into
what field their interest is directed, a direct voice in
the administration of Association affairs. It creates,
properly, the assurance that every alumnus is having
his say. And for the Association itself it assures a
program of work moulded to the desires of all the
alumni and not the conception of just a small group
of leaders located in or near Ann Arbor. Finally, the
all-important close relationship between the University
and the Alumni Association is secured through the
membership on the Executive Committee of the Hoard
of Directors of University administrative officers, them-
selves alumni. .
The "home offices" of the Association are located
in Alumni Memorial Hall on the Campus. This build-
ing was erected and given to the University by the
alumni, the first structure to he built on the Campus
from funds coming from many different alumni. From
these offices all the activities of the Association are
directed and here The Michigan Alumnus, the official
organ of the Association, is edited and sent to the
alumni twenty-six times a year. In this building also
is the Alumni Catalogue, the complete roster of every
man and woman who ever lias attended the University.
This office is maintained by University funds, but is
available to Association use at all times. Again in
accordance with the Michigan alumni tradition, this
office is as complete and efficiently managed as any
in the country. More than one hundred thousand
names are filed there, together with often very com-
plete biographical data.
Is it any wonder, understanding with what its offi-
cials have to work, that Michigan's Alumni Associ-
ation functions efficiently? It must be understood,
too, that behind all this mechanism and this interest
on the part of the alumni, there is the wholehearted
encouragement and support of the University admin-
istration. There might very properly be found in
administrative circles an attitude of inattention, for
Michigan is a state university. In a state university
the need of alumni support is not imperative. To
give proof to the wisdom of Michigan Presidents in
their energetic support of alumni activity can be cited
the fact that today nearly one-half of the physical
wealth of the University has come through the gen-
erosity of alumni and friends of the University. The
University of Michigan has to give thanks to its alumni
for such structures as the Law Quadrangle, The Mich-
igan Union, Clements Library, Hill Auditorium, The
Michigan League, Helen Newberry Residence, Alumni
Memorial Hall, Betsy Harbour Dormitory, Waterman
and Barbour Gyms, Martha Cook Building, Simpson
Memorial Institute, Fletcher Hall. University Press
Building, and for the thousands of dollars which have
Another Gift—The Law Croup
been given for scholarships, loan funds, scientific ex-
peditions and equipment.
To give opportunity for Michigan alumni to express
their interest in their University in the manifold ways
open to them, is the chief function of the Alumni
Association. An intelligent and thorough knowledge
of the University is essential if the alumni are to direct
their attention along sound lines. The Michigan Alum-
nus is the organ which brings that knowledge to them.
Through the medium of the Alumni Ten-Year
Program opportunity is offered for making gifts to
Michigan in accordance with the needs and desires
of the University. It is an unusual program, differing
from the orthodox plan of educational financial cam-
paigns, but it has already produced unusual results
in the face of depression obstacles. It is a continuous
project, designed to enable Michigan alumni to keep
intact their present reputation of having done more
for their University than have the alumni of any other
state university.
Alumni loyalty is truly a Michigan tradition. It
has endured through the years. Present generations
recognize it. Future generations of Michigan students
will be told of it. The pride and satisfaction which
has inspired their predecessors in upholding this tra-
dition will carry through.
The ultimate of accuracy in scientific measuring
instruments would seem to be a device, weighing only
a thousandth as much as a drop of water, which is
used to measure the heat of stars. Insignificant as it

of 100 miles.
The production of cellophane is carried on in much
the same manner as that of artificial silk. The products
are the same until the final stage when the silk is re-
duced to threads while the cellophane is cast into
sheets.

Eric E. Sommer
Here's a poor engineer who is
always having trouble with his
name. Last year the Student Di-
rectory had him in the middle of
the Smiths. This year they call
him Emil Sommers.
High scholarship and forensic
ability brought him to the attention
of his classmates. Of course a
very agreeable personality and an
ability to mix didn't have a thing
to do with it. When Toastmasters
Club was reorganized last year, af-
ter a lapse of years, Eric was one
of the first undergraduates chosen
for membership.
Tau Beta Pi also recognized his
ability last year. He is at present
on the initiation committee of that
organization. Though a Chemical
and a member of the A. I. Ch. E.
he surmounted the handicap and
became president of Sigma Rho
Tau, which organization is going
strong under his leadership.
Russel W. Houvener
Russel Houvener stands out as
one of the shining lights of the
East Engineering clan, more com-
monly known as Chemical Engi-
neers.
Russ has been striving forward
ever since his entrance here in 1931.
and for the past two years has been
a member of the Honor Council.
At the present time he is a member
of the A.I.Ch.E. and holds a la!)
assistant's job in the Chemical En-
gineering department.
Of recent note is the award of
Phi Pamela Upsilon which was won
by Russ. This award consists of
a scholarship and membership to
the American Chemical Society to
the Chemical with the highest scho-
lastic standing (incidentally, for
those of you with high ambitions,
Russ has an average of 3.9). In
addition to being a very fine fellow
and friend, Russ is a member of
Tau Beta Pi and Phi Kappa Phi,
national scholastic honor society.
Tage 0. Jacobson
From Stockholm, Sweden, came
Tage O. Jacobson to Cass Tech-
nical High School, Detroit, and
thence to Ann Arbor to be an im-
portant figure in the "New Deal"
political party, which swept the
Senior class elections this year.
Popular and well-liked by his
classmates, Tage has had a finger
in a great many pies. While presi-
dent of his high school graduation
class he received an Alumni Scholar-
ship, which he has held for four
years. As a freshman here he
played football, hockey and engaged
in track. For the last three seasons
we engineers have eagerly watched
for his number "72" on the varsity
gridiron, where he did a fine job,
winning two letters.
Tage was president of the Junior
class last year. He is a Kappa Sig-
ma, a member of the A.S.M.E.
Aero Division, Engineering Council
representative, a member of the
Engineering Open House Executive
Committee.
M. Alvin Mortenson
On June 3, 1914, a little spark,
which in later years was to burst
into flame, sprang up in the city of
Battle Creek. Today this little
spark is Al Mortenson, Senior
Electrical.
He began his career as a musi-
cian in the high school band and
in the fall of 1931, transferred his
talents here, where he has played
as a member of the "fighting hun-
dred" for three and one-half years.
His scholastic record is by no
means lacking with such honor as
Phi Eta Sigma, Triangles, Vulcans,
and Tau Beta Pi. Among his other
achievements are president of Delta
Upsilon, and ticket chairman of the
approaching A.I.E.E. banquet. In
spite of all this Al still remains a
quiet, unassuming fellow, well liked
by those who know him.
Lester V. Colwcll
Lester V. "Les" Colwell is a
pretty outstanding fellow for a little
guy. He's one of those who make
the most of their size and squeeze
in everywhere.
We began to hear about him when
we were sophomores. At that time
he was already doing research work
in the Engineering Mechanics De-
partment.
At the end of his junior year he
became a member of Tau Beta Pi.
This year he is Secretary of the
A.S.M.E. Mechanical Division. He
was general chairman of the A.S.
M.E. "Roast" held in December,
and has been chosen a member of
the Slide Rule Dance Committee.
Though it is not generally known,
Les is now a member of the "Ball
and Chain Club"—he was married
sometime before Christmas, unan-
nounced.

. . . . Says the Editor
ACTION AT LAST!
Words flew hot and heavy at the
Engineering Council Meeting on
Thursday, February 28, and when
the melee was over, something con-
crete had been accomplished. Most
important was the fact that the
Council was squarely behind the
proposed Open House to be held
sometime in May.
An Open House Executive Com-
mittee, composed of Allen Knuusi,
Tage Jacobson, John Schmidt, and
Joe Wagner was appointed to set
about determining the best type of
organization suited to the needs of
such an undertaking.
The Committee reported back to
the meeting on March 5, with a plan
of five major committees—Publicity
(Frank Wallace), Finance (Les-
ter Colwell), Displays (Gale Ster-
ling), Program (Frank Denison),
Guides (Eric Sommer). These
committees are to be headed by the
men whose names appear in paren-
theses and are to function for the
entire college under the supervision
of the Executive Committee which
is directly responsible to the Engi-
neering Council.
Displays Planned
It is planned to have each of the
professional societies supervise the
display in its own particular depart-
ment and to hold the president of
the society responsible for the suc-
cess or failure of the exhibit.
Every interested student in the
college can and should find a place
for himself to help in the success
of the venture. There are to be no
lines drawn between members and
non-members of the societies.
The Publicity Committee will
shortly begin to publish weekly bul-
letins telling of what has been done,
explaining future plans, and issu-
ing calls for help where needed.
Watch for them!
Shirts Suggested
The possibility of using a dis-
tinctively marked shirt for the per-
iod of the Open House has been
discussed, but the matter has been
tabled until each representative can
get the sentiment of his group on
the matter. Since the Open House
is exclusively an Engineering School
project, some mark is necessary to
distinguish the engineer from "Pub-
lic Enemy No. 1"—the Lits. What
is your reaction?
Representatives Awakened
Another result of that meeting
was the impressing of each repre-
sentative with his responsibility to
the Council and to the organization
which he represents. Each society
is somewhat to blame for the atti-
tude it takes toward its representa-
tive. Now the representatives are
going to work backwards to make
the societies realize the importance
of their representation in the En-
gineering Council. As the co-
ordinating body, the Council cannot
function unless every organization
takes an active interest in it. It's
about time we got together!!
ARE WE GOOD CITIZENS?
Prof. Dahlstrom recently made
the statement that we people are to
blame if graft is allowed to exist
in our government and faulty lead-
ers are chosen. Since we elect
those who abuse their leadership
privilege, we must suffer the con-
sequences.
A little intelligent investigation
and a more discerning interest in
local and national affairs is required
of every citizen. We engineers
should begin right now to become
good citizens, first, by reading in-
telligently a daily newspaper, and
second, by choosing wide-awake
leaders for our student organiza-
tions.

STRESSES
STE
Maybe you have been wondering for the past few
years what the significance of the heading to this page
is. Stay no more in the dark, engineer, the light
cometh, the veil falls, the door opens, etc.
Illustrating the Meaning of Stress and Strain
Question: "What's that you're wearing, Mama?"
Answer: "S'tress."
Question: "W hat's that thing on the track, Dad-
dy?"
Answer: "'S'train."
Now that that's cleared up, there's that matter of
the general opinion in the lit school that engineers are
pretty dense. T. R. F. of the Education school has
set forth a solution to the problem so simple as to he
utterly astounding. He proposes that the level of the
engineer's intelligence be raised by requiring that all
slide rules be carried in the breast pocket instead of
on the hip.
Which brings up the question: "What is it that
has—
Four standsie upsies,
Four hangsie downsies,
Two hookers,
Two lookers,
And a swishy swashy?"
N.B. See upper left corner.
Then there is the engineer who calls his girl discon-
tinuous integral—because she has no limit.

Four years of trying to get through an engineering
school have convinced us that the engineering cur-
riculum is lacking, and that some prerequisites are need-
ed to the prerequisites. May we humbly suggest that
the following be added to next year's catalogue:

"OH HELL"
Sitting with our astute left ears to the ground, a
murmer reached our editorial sensorial nerves that
the Technic was being criticized for lack of initiative
and constructiveness. The thought gave us pause;
perhaps the dear reader wished a "How to Build It"
section in which we would tell how to remodel that
old cuspidor that Aunt Susie gave us and how to con-
trive divers other cunning little gadgets, or . All
at once it flashed upon us that what the reader really
wanted was a deep and peering investigation into the
unknown. Forthwith and thereupon we donned our
lab aprons, hauled out our old Chemistry 5E junk,
proceeded downtown and got gloriously soused.
Five clays later we emerged from a halo of ice
packs to present our findings on a subject which has
too long been open to the badinage of the layman. This
deplorable state of affairs concerns the abode of none
other than Lucifer G. "Hot Stuff" Mephistopheles,
alias "Zamiel" alias "Old Nick" alias "Beelzebub"
alias "The Devil."
The investigator has formulated a hypothesis which
is simply that most people when in an uncertain frame
of mind are prone to compare somebody or something
with hell. It would thus seem extremely likely that
these individuals must have some knowledge upon
which to base this most irregular remark. Either they
had visited purgatory in some former incarnation, or
they must have had a short and unpleasant visit there
as when a person remarks that he had a "Hell of a
time." Upon this basis the investigator collected 4. 594,
333l/2* of these remarks, and averaged them. It is
with considerable pleasure that we note the results:
Hellish Conditions
Temperature of Hell....2.8 7463545 i .00000000° C.
Climate of Hell Not so hot.
Weather of Hell Rain, followed by 4628 colds.
Economic Condition Things are looking up.
From these results, it becomes apparent that the

Bell System engineers long ago began to work out a way to clear city streets of overhead wires.
The first telephone cables were crude affairs—a few wires drawn through a pipe. Contin-

turing methods, cables of smaller size yet far greater capacity.
The cable with the greatest number of wires today—3636—
is 2%' in diameter.

This cut serves as an excellent example of the type of friendly
banter which Professor Badger loves to exchange with his pro-
teges. Contributor unknown (we hope).
It is with a feeling of profound gratitude and
humble appreciation that the authors dedicate this space
to Professor Walter Lucius Badger, for his unselfish
disregard of self-aggrandizement in devoting his intel-
lectual and oratorical talents to the advancement of
engineering enlightenment, and for his untiring (and
admittedly fruitless) search for an engineer. It is
the purpose of the authors to convey to Professor
Badger through this medium some slight measure of
the public recognition and approbation which he has
so modestly deferred.
Students attending his classes are brought to a
realization, in some subtly metaphysical fashion, that
THIS is the man who has in his files more than ten
thousand heat transfer coefficients; who can walk into
any chemical laboratory in the country and call the
director by his first name; who inspirationally ad-
dressed his class with the now famous words:
"Engineers — Men of Michigan — Hell!"
The insignificant verses below are an attempt to
crystallize in a more permanent form those priceless
moments in the classroom which, perhaps, constitute
his greatest claim to pedagogical renown.
Declare thyself, O Muse!

Oxy-Acetylene Machine Cutting and Flame
Machining Lower the Cost of Fabrication.
By H. ULLMER*
eling of steel plates to the cutting of
intricate patterns. Most of the ma-
chines can cut vertically and hori-
zontally. Some can be adjusted to cut
circles without the use of patterns.
Others cut bevels, gouge grooves,
and shape complicated designs.
Shape Thousands of
Identical Parts
The economical continuous or in-
termittent production of identical
regular or irregular shapes from rolled
or forged steel is an outstanding ac-
complishment of present day oxy-
acetylene cutting machines. With
remarkable ease they follow templets
of the desired form for the pieces to
be cut. So accurate are the results
that for many purposes the cut pieces
can be used without machining or
further finishing. Only by looking
close at the smooth sides of the cut
can an experienced eye tell the differ-
ence from a mechanical cut.
In a Wide Variety of Pieces
Some of the different pieces of
equipment fabricated from oxy-acety-
lene shape-cut steel include: press
frames of rolled steel requiring nigh
strength and resistance to shock,
gear blanks, cams in all types of in-
tricate designs, forming dies which
need little finishing before use, and
flywheels often over a foot thick. In
every case the shape-cut parts retain
the great inherent strength and
toughness of the rolled or forged
steel from which they are made.
Costs Cut With Oxy-
Acetylene Cutting
No great investment in machinery
is needed for oxy-acetylene cutting.
ONE OR A MILLION — Same cut parts can be produced easily and
cheaply by oxy-acetylene machine cutting. These dipper tooth blanks
are alike as two peas in a pod. No expensive patterns or dies are required.
LIKE CUTTING CHEESE—the
oxy-acetylene cutting blowpipe
demolishes a 52-lon cast iron rock
crusher bowl.
Machines for guiding and moving
the oxy-acetylene cutting blowpipe
automatically are the most important
of the recent developments in man's
harnessing of flame for productive
purposes. Like ribbons of fire, multi-
ple flames of oxygen mixed with
acetylene surround a jet of pure oxy-
gen to cut steel, cast iron and other
ferrous metals into intricate patterns
—quickly and easily—with remark-
able savings in costs over old methods.
New Methods of Production
Since 1505, oxy-acetylene cutting
by hand has been widely used in
demolition and maintenance work.
During the last several years, the
effectiveness of oxy-acetylene cutting
as a means of production has been
proved and tremendously multiplied
by the development of machines for
various repetitive cutting require-
ments. The operating fields of these
machines range from the simple bev-
FLAME-CUT PARTS —are
welded into assemblies like this
yoke for a 25,000 KVA Water
Wheel Generator.
Pattern cost is reduced to a minimum
and the making and storage of ex-
pensive and intricate patterns is
avoided. In most cases the machine
cut shapes can be beveled easily by
oxy-acetylene cutting and quickly
made ready for assembly by welding,
thus further reducing the cost of the
finished equipment and making a more
sa la ble a nd a more serviceable prod uc t.
Machines Now Available
Machines of all sorts for various
types of oxy-acetylene cutting and
flame machining have been developed
by The Linde Air Products Company,
a Unit of Union Carbide and Carbon
Corporation. Assistance and infor-
mation as to how oxy-acetylene cut-
ting can be economically fitted into

SIGMA RHO TAU
As a culmination to the first semester's training
activities of Sigma Rho Tau, thirteen neophytes were
initiated into the rank of Nmnce Wednesday, Febru-
ary 20. The usual informal fun-provoking initiation
took place in the afternoon at the Stump near the
West Engineering Building. The object of this phase
of the initiation being to test the initiates' ability to use
the ready wit of stump speakers, each initiate was re-
quired to address the bystanders on all manner of sub-
jects ranging from "The Dangers of Co-Education"
to "Why Trousers Should Replace Skirts." The in-
itiates were also required to give long and complicated
"tongue-twisters" in a shrill falsetto voice, and lengthy
dissertation on the mysteries of Tung Oil.
The informal initiation was followed in the evening
by the formal initiation at the Union at which Ira
M. Smith, Registrar of the University, gave a very
thought-provoking and entertaining talk on topics
closely related to the engineering profession. Refer-
ring to the University, Registrar Smith made this very
pertinent observation, "In this service station we learn
the traffic rules of democracy."
Those Neophytes initiated into the rank of Novice
were: William K. Boice, '35E; Arthur J. Dubord,
Jr., '37E; and the following from the class of '38:
Maxwell Anning, William Burns, Leon Highhouse,
Michael Jastremsky, William Koch, Ivan Kollgaard,
Ralph Laidlaw, Bruce Rohn, William E. Shackelton,
Frank Vihtelic, and John Wisler.

THE ART OF SHIPBUILDING
The second set of a series of motion pictures
sponsored by the Quarterdeck Society was presented
on Tuesday evening, February 20. The pictures de-
pict the procedure of shipbuilding in steps of phases.
At an earlier performance 6 reels had been shown
which dealt with the preliminary work and the sub-
deck construction. The reels presented on Feb. 20
took up the thread of the story from this point on,
beginning with the plating below the main deck. The
first of the reels showed the process of erecting the
girders and beams below the main deck. Later the
plating gang rame along, riveting the plates into place.
Following this, the audience witnessed the spectacle
of machinery foundations, motors, generators, and the
control panel going down the hatch. This equipment
weighing several tons, was carefully lowered into place
and was fastened secure.
With the interior apparatus and construction dis-
posed of, the framing above the main deck, and the
riveting of shell plates into place was the next general
step. This also included the attachment of the tran-
som, which weighs about twenty tons. The transom
was completely assembled before fastening it to the
ship, it being swung into place with the overhead crane.
The final reel included the erection of girders and beams
above the main deck along with the laying of the boat
deck. Along with this were the placements of the
rudder, windlass, and davits. The rudder, previous to
its installation, was specially treated to prevent rusting
and corrosion.
A. I. Ch. E. Room
The student branch of the American Institute of
Chemical Engineers began in 1922, although the
parent institute was founded in 1908. The first student
chapter was established at the University of Michigan.
In the plans of the East Engineering Building there
appeared a room in which this organization could meet.
In 1923 this room came into being.
It was placed next to the Seminar with a folding
partition separating the two in order to provide more
room if the membership increased beyond the capacity
of the one room.
An inspection of the furniture in this room will
reveal the fact that plain oak chairs and tables are
prevalent. There is, however, one exception—a black
leather couch. Originally, the idea was to furnish the
room more comfortably by asking for furniture do-
nations. R. H. Plumb contributed the couch, and
since then no other articles have been received. Inci-
dentally, the donation period is still open.
All chemical engineers are eligible to join, the fee
being 50 cents. The members meet once a month, and
at that time a program is provided consisting usually
of a speaker and refreshments. Visitors are invited
and usually do attend the meetings, especially if there
is an out-of-town speaker.
THE SLIDE RULE APPROACHES
The outstanding social event of the Engineering
College is the Slide Rule Dance and this year is to
be no exception. On Friday, March 29, the engineers
will head the social activities on the campus with the
Annual Slide Rule Dance at the Union. If last year
was an indication of the popularity of the dance, it
would be highly advisable to salt away three "berries"
and get your "pasteboard" early. The dance this
year is headed by Joseph C. Wagner as Chairman,
which is a good assurance of a successful party. The
Dance Committee is as follows: Robert Sloane acts
as Joe's running mate in the capacity of assistant
chairman; the publicity is in the hands of Robert
Thorne and Lester Colwell; Sam Tramontana and
Albert E. Marshall are handling the tickets; Ed Jaros
is in charge of the orchestra, while Al Stevens is ar-
ranging the program. Members of the other commit-
tees are William McCance, Oliver Spark, Robert Tay-
lor, and Raymond Foley.

TALKING TRAIN
To those who see the Union Pacific's new stream-
lined train, the M-1001, as she approaches a station,
it may be a source of curiosity that the headlight
should be burning even in the daytime. No, it's not
merely carelessness on the part of the engineer—
there's a very particular reason for this display of
light. The headlight is of special construction—it is
a neon light capable of blinking as fast as the vibra-
tions of sound. A microphone picks up the voice of a
person on board the M-1001, a transmitter converts
the sound waves into electrical impulses, and the neon
headlight changes these impulses into light waves. A
mirror in the station picks up the beam and the trans-
mitting process is reversed. Thus, briefly, is accom-
plished one of the long desired aims of railroading
—the establishment of effective means of communica-
tion between a moving train and a station.
MARINE SURGERY
When, a short time ago, the tanker Svithod was
laid up for repairs, it was discovered that she was so
weakened by rust amidships that she was unseaworthy.
Rather than replace the entire ship, the owners decided
to attempt a major operation. The bow and stern
were cut off and a brand new center section inserted.
While they were at it, they also changed the shape
of the stern, thus adding considerably to the tanker's
speed without increasing her fuel consumption. Al-
though this type of marine surgery is not unique—•
it's been done several times before—its occurrence is
sufficiently rare to be of considerable novelty to ship-
ping interests.

poration, located near Chicago, will build high speed
locomotives.

Members of the Michigan club of New York were
recently treated to a showing of several of the latest
things to be taken out of the scientific "magic box"
of the Bell laboratories, by Dr. Sergius P. Grace, vice-
president of the laboratories. The first was an in-
strument that resembled an overgrown pipe, and. when
in use, it is placed in the mouth much in the same
manner as is a pipe. Its purpose is, however, not to
furnish smoke but the means of speach to those un-
fortunate persons who have lost their natural speaking
organs. This instrument pours into the mouth a pure
tone, which becomes intelligible speech when the mouth,
lips and tongue are moved in the ordinary conversa-
tional manner. Previously developed instruments de-
pended for their operation upon the supplying of air
to produce the tone; in many cases air was obtained
by an operation which connected the artificial larynx to
the lung supply. The electric lung requires a pocket
battery little bigger than a deck of cards. When the
voiceless person wishes to speak he merely puts his
"pipe" in his mouth, presses a button, and proceeds to
talk. The tone continues as long as he holds the
switch closed.
Magnetic handcuffs may be used to subdue future
candidates for the office of Public Enemy Number 1.
The type shown by Dr. Grace consisted of a cuff for
each wrist, the chain between being joined by placing
together two flat pieces of a new metal. These plates
are electromagnetic—electric current is run through a
coil on the back of one of them. A current of one
third of an ampere is sufficient to hold them together
with a force of a fifth of a ton—even the most power-
ful man cannot separate them. The new alloy is, as
yet, nameless. It is composed of 49 percent cobalt,
49 percent iron and 2 percent vanadium. It possesses
20 times the magnetic attraction of pure iron.
PHOTOELECTRIC ALIGNMENT
Photoelectric cells are now being used in perfor-
ating machines which turn out the nation's postage
stamps. Complaints by stamp collectors that some-
thing should be done about the imperfect alignment
of perforations have at last been heeded. On the
newly developed machines, when the perforator moves
off center, the cells cause a series of compensating
mechanisms to realign the perforations.
Some stastically-minded individual has figured out
that, in the last fiscal year, these perforating machines
punched 370,000,000.000,000 (370 trillion) holes along
the borders of the stamps, and that the paper punched
from these holes amounted to 35 tons.

It's only half the size of a man, this copper "dough-
nut" with which Ohio State University physicists are
able to generate a million volts of electricity a second.
Differing greatly from any of the other great machines
in America and Europe that produce electrical cur-
rents at high voltages, this generator consists merely
of a wooden shell in the form of a doughnut, its outer
surface covered with a smooth copper skin. A silk
belt runs through the hole in the center. As installed
in the laboratory the apparatus resembles a huge dough-
nut hanging on a string. Actually the belt does not
touch the shell, which hangs suspended from the ceiling
by cables.
When in operation, the belt, carrying electricity,
is driven through the hole. The "juice" is brushed off
and is stored on the outside surface of the copper
covering. In only a second or two this surface will
store up a million volts. The current is drawn off as
needed through two electrodes inside the hollow
doughnut.
Like that of other high-power machines the primary
purpose of its development is to serve as a tool by
which physicists might break down the atom and so
learn the very inmost secrets of matter. Credit for
the development of this machine belongs to Dr. Wil-
lard H. Bennett.

GLASSES FOR ELECTRIC EYES
Electric eyes are wearing colored glasses and
doing a new job. As a result of strict NRA code
requirements, the paper industry had to find a
rigid means of classifying different qualities of
paper. The Institute of Paper Chemistry found that
as far as white book papers were concerned, the
percentage of light they reflected was an indication
of their quality.
The General Electric general engineering laboratory
built the necessary device—an instrument
which relies on the scrutiny of two phototubes in
series to measure the coefficient of reflection. This
is an exceedingly delicate task, as the matter of a
small percentage of reflectivity determines the price
and quality of a paper.
Here's where the glasses come in. To do certain jobs
right, the electric eyes had to don different colored
glass screens in the form of a filter and lens arrange-
ment. It wasn't that they were getting old; they
just needed a little assistance.
J. L. Michaelson, Northwest Missouri State Teach
ers College, '28, is G-E engineer in charge of build-
ing these instruments.
"GE-1000"
When, after a two-day search, a rescue plane finally
located the lost transport plane which "mushed
down" on a lonely Adirondack peak a couple of
months ago, General Electric radio engineers rushed
an emergency portable short-wave radio station
into the mountain country to help in co-ordinating
land and air rescue operations. The disabled ship
was in the center of a wilderness, miles from the
nearest means of communication. The radio expedi-
tion, however, managed to set up its equipment in
a cabin at the end of a one-track automobile
trail, only four miles from the scene of the mishap.
There, designated as station "GE-1000" at the re-
quest of the airline operators, the equipment was
used as an emergency unit in the airline's radio
system. The General Electric engineers co-operated
in communicating with the planes that guided the
rescue parties toward the stranded fliers. They also
helped send back news of the rescue, directly to
owners of short-wave receiving sets, and through
a rebroadcast by WGY, the General Electric sta-
tion at Schenectady, to other listeners.

David, U. of Kentucky, '19; E. II. Fritschel, Iowa
State, '26; G. W. Fyler, Yale, '29; R. H. William-

Lash, Ohio Northern, '29, comprised the General
Electric radio expedition.
TURBINE BIOGRAPHY
A turbine can now write its own biography, with
the aid of recording instruments recently de-
veloped in the General Electric general engineering
laboratory.
These sensitive devices were developed for the super-
vision of large turbines from a point remote from
the scene of operation. The instruments measure
and record shaft eccentricity, bearing vibration,
shell expansion, and interference of rubbing or rotat-
ing parts. They provide the operator with an indi-
cation and a permanent record, on paper, of mechan-
ical performance throughout the starting period and
subsequent running time.
C. D. Greentree, Alabama Poly, '28; A. V. Mershon,

Applied Science, '23, of the General Electric general
engineering laboratory, worked on the instruments.

Mr. Thoren, a senior aero, points out the
many hidden possibilities of stratospheric
travel. Aerodynamic design, controllable
pitch propellers, and superchargers, the
three most outstanding factors in its
development are very ably discussed. It is
truly an account that will interest anyone
with an eye to the future.
C L. Clark, of the Department of

Billowing Clouds Hide the Earth
Scientific American
Via Stratosphere
R. L THOREN, 35E
Wiley Post's recent flight from Los Angeles to
Cleveland, via the stratosphere, marks another mile-
stone in the progress of aviation. It is prohably the
introduction to a new era of transport flying. The recent
balloon flight undertaken by the Piccards has suddenly
made the public stratosphere conscious.
The region in space immediately surrounding the
earth and extending to an altitude of approximately
38,000 feet is called the troposphere. Beyond this lies
the stratosphere; the transition phase being the tropo-
pause. The troposphere is characterized by the de-
creasing of the density, pressure and temperature of the
air with increasing altitude. It is, a region of clouds,
sleet, and random air currents. In the stratosphere,
while increasing altitude results in decreasing pressure,
the temperature remains substantially constant at
-67° F. There are no clouds, no moisture to form ice
on the wings of airplanes, and no vertical air currents
to cause sudden and violent bumps while flying at high
speeds.
The three most important factors which determine
the success of aircraft in the transportation of passen-
gers are safety, speed and comfort.
Safety is of prime importance and for this reason
some provision must be made to guard against acci-
dents in case of engine failure while flying over un-
favorable landing terrain. The one solution to this is
high altitude operation, which allows the pilot ample
time to choose a suitable landing field in case of trouble.
A well designed transport ship, flying at 40,000 feet
altitude, has a landing radius of 120 miles and requires
approximately one hour to make the descent. In this
time the mechanics would have ample time to correct
any minor engine trouble, eliminating the necessity of
landing. Other safety features of the stratosphere are
the absence of clouds, storms and moisture. Moisture
causes formation of ice on the wings and propeller and
has been a very serious obstacle in the progress of air
transportation. Visibility is unlimited in the strato-
&gt;&lt;phere at all times and the fact that clouds between
the earth and the stratosphere hide the earth more than
75% of the time is of minor importance. In the rare
case of failure of the navigation instruments, the stars,
which are visible 24 hours a day, may be used for navi-
gation.
The speed that air transports may attain in the
stratosphere exceeds by far the speed they attain in the
troposphere. Experts agree that the maximum speed
that can be attained by air transports flying at low
altitudes, has almost been reached and that any great
increase in speed must come about by flying at higher
altitudes. Air resistance is directly proportional to
the square of the velocity and to the first power of the
density. Air density decreases with altitude and as a
result air resistance is decreased. Hence to maintain
the same flying speed, less horsepower is required at
an altitude of 40,000 feet than is required at 5,000 feet.
Likewise, with the same horsepower expended, the
speed of flight will be much greater at the higher
altitude. Comparative figures for a Douglas transport
ship illustrate this point.

The stratosphere has well defined wind belts exist-
ing at various altitudes, while in the region between
ground level and 30,000 feet, the winds are very
changeable. The winds in the stratosphere are strong,
some having a velocity of 80 miles per hour, and are
of definite location with respect to the altitude, so that
the pilot of an airplane can be guided by a chart to an
altitude where he can find a wind of high velocity
blowing in the desired direction. The economy of such
a device is evident. Chartered Stratosphere Hying has
great possibilities. A much greater degree of comfort
will be possible in stratosphere flying than in our pres-
ent low altitude air transit. Vertical air currents of
the troposphere impose severe stresses on the airplane
structure and frequently cause passengers considerable
discomfort. The effect of these "air bumps" is greatly-
amplified at high speeds. The advantage of the absence
of such currents can readily be seen. Atmospheric
conditions, particularly the temperature, are uniform
in the stratosphere. Though the temperature is very

low, the fact that it is nearly constant simplifies the
problem of providing proper living conditions for the
passengers of stratosphere transports. Above 18,000
feet there is not enough oxygen to support life com-
fortably, and above 35,000 feet the air pressure is so
low that the passengers must either wear sealed suits
under air pressure, or the cabin must be sealed and the
pressure within maintained at 10 to 14 lbs. per sq. inch.
The latter method will probably be employed in trans-
port airplanes, because one ventilating and heating sys-
tem can maintain atmospheric conditions in the cabin.
Since the air will have to be constantly exhausted from
the cabin to dispose of the carbon dioxide, leaks in the
cabin will merely provide additional vents. As the air
pressure in the cabin is higher than the pressure out-
side, leaks do not have the serious effect that they would
have were the conditions reversed, as in submarines.
The air will be supplied to the cabin by the engine
supercharger. The power required by a supercharger
to furnish air to the passengers will not be excessive,
as one passenger consumes 1200 cu. ft. per hour of
free air at sea level pressure, while the engines on
the airliner will consume about 90,000 cu. ft. per hour
total. The cabin will be sealed and insulated, but it
must also be heated because of the low temperature
outside. Heating may readily be accomplished by steam
radiators used in conjunction with steam jacketed ex-
haust stacks. Another method would be to utilize the
heat of compression in the air supplied to the engine
by the supercharger. Considerable heat is developed
in compressing the air from the low outside pressure
up to the intake manifold pressure.
A few years ago aerial transportation was all car-
ried on below 5000 feet, at cruising speeds of 120 to
140 M.P.H. We now see that the stratosphere is suit-
able for aerial transportation and that our present
equipment, with certain alterations and improvements,
can be used for flying at much higher altitudes, with
greater safety, higher speed and increased comfort.
What has made possible the rapid strides in boosting
the speeds and altitudes of operation to such an extent?
There are three factors which are most outstanding in
this rapid development: namely, aerodynamic design,
controllahle pitch propellers and superchargers.
Improvements in aerodynamic design have been
centered on reducing parasite drag by streamlining and
by retracting the landing gear partially or entirely into
the wing or fuselage. Drag of wings has been greatly
reduced by using less wing area and thinner airfoil
sections. This would ordinarily result in an excessive
increase in landing speed, but, by the use of wing
flaps, the lift is increased to such an extent that the
landing speed is again reduced to a safe value. Along

pace in the development of the monocoque dural fuse-
lage, which is ideally suited for air-tight cabins.
The development of controllable and automatic
pitched propellers has greatly facilitated high altitude
flying. An ordinary fixed blade propeller is entirely
unsuited for operating at high altitudes. In order that
the engine may develop its full horsepower during the
take-off, the propeller pitch must be low. The low
pitch results in a racing of the engine at high altitudes,
where the density is much less than at sea level. By
using a controllable pitch propeller, the blade may be
set at the angle best suited for the take-off. After the
take-off, the pitch can be increased to give best results
at any altitude. An innovation is the new propeller
whose pitch is automatically set to keep the engine speed
constant during all manoeuvers. This propeller reduces
engine wear and increases reliability.
Supercharging has been of the greatest importance
in high altitude flying. By means of various types of
superchargers air is supplied to the intake manifold at
sea level pressure thus making possible the maintenance
of full power at high altitudes. Superchargers of the
Roots blower type and the gear driven centrifugal type
have been successfully used, but exhaust driven super-
chargers are coming into prominence because the power
of the exhaust gases increases as the air pressure of
higher altitudes decreases.
Thus it can be seen that the one apparent disad-
vantage of stratosphere flying—decreased payload—is
greatly outweighed by the advantages of greater safety,
higher speed, and increased comfort.
Calorizing Steel
C. L. CLARK
Research Engineer
Department- of Engineering Research
Steel, to render satisfactory service at high tem-
peratures, must possess sufficient creep strength or
load-carrying ability to withstand the applied stress
without undergoing more than a definite, fixed deforma-
tion. There are also many cases in which a good de-
gree of oxidation and corrosion resistance is necessary.
Certain of the low-alloyed, pearlitic type steels pos-
sess the first of the above two requirements, at least
at temperatures up to 1200 or 1300° F., but a high
alloy content is necessary to fulfill the second qualifica-
tion. Since the cost of the steel rises rapidly with the
increasing alloy content, inexpensive materials pos-
sessing a suitable resistance to oxidation and corrosion
have long been sought. Calorized steels fulfill this need
in many applications.
Calorizing is the process of producing an alloy of
iron and aluminum on the surface of steel. This is
accomplished in two steps. In the first the parts to be
Calorized are heated at 1700° F. for 6 hours in a closed
retort with the usual Calorizing mixture. An iron-
aluminum alloy which contains 50 to 75 per cent alumi-
num is formed on the surface and extends to a depth of
0.005 to 0.010 of an inch. The Calorized parts are then
heated at 1800° F. for 48 hours in another closed re-
tort. This causes a penetration of the iron-aluminum
alloy into the steel and reduces the aluminum content
of the thin surface alloy to about 30 per cent. The
depth of penetration depends upon such factors as the
chemical composition and grain size of the steel, but
averages approximately 0.040 of an inch. A photo-
micrograph of a Calorized coating at a magnification
of 100 diameters is shown in Figure 1.
The Calorized coating is composed of two types of
structure. The outer section, which generally extends

sist of the brittle compound FeAl3. The underlying
section is free from defects and possesses a large co-
lumnar structure. It is this section which imparts the
oxidation and corrosion resistance.
A Calorized steel is extremely resistant both to oxi-
dation and many types of corrosion, particularly those
of the sulphide type, at temperatures up to 1400° F.
or 1500° F. The steel to be Calorized, however, must
be selected with care, for if it undergoes more than
a certain amount of deformation during service, the
Calorized coating will be cracked and its protective
characteristics thus destroyed. Investigations show
that this cracking will not occur if the plastic deforma-
tion is under 5 or 6 per cent. In other words, in appli-
cations of this type, the steel supplies the strength,
while the coating furnishes the oxidation and corrosion
resistance.
In order to show more
clearly the differences in
the load-carrying ability
of various Calorized
steels, specimens, of each
were subjected to identi-
cal loads at a given tem-
perature and the tests
continued until fracture
of some of them was ob-
tained. The load and
temperature were based
on actual conditions
which are encountered
in certain commercial
applications. Similar
tests were also conducted
on certain of the un-
calorized specimens in
order to determine the
influence of Calorizing
on the load-carrying
ability.
Figure 2 shows the results obtained at 1400° under
a stress of 2000 pounds per square inch. The tests
were conducted for a maximum of 600 hours and dur-
ing this time all of the uncalorized specimens frac-
tured. Two of the Calorized specimens, mild steel and
0.50 per cent molybdenum, also fractured in 99.5 and
480 hours, respectively. The DM elongated 6.4 per
cent and as a result its Calorized coating was cracked.
The 1.0 per cent Molybdenum Steel, however, only
elongated 2.24 per cent during this time period and
no cracks appeared in the coating.
If the results from the uncalorized and Calorized
specimens are compared, it will become evident that
Calorizing increased the load-carrying ability in all
cases. It is believed, however, that this improvement
can be largely attributed to the increased oxidation re-
sistance, rather than to an actual increase in the strength
of the Calorized specimens.
Another advantage of Calorized steels is their high
surface hardness. This property is of especial impor-
tance if abrasion is encountered during service. For
example, in oil cracking stills, tubes often fail due
either to the erosive action of the hot oil, or to the
abrasive action of the tube cleaners during the removal
of the deposited coke. Calorized tubes are able to
resist both of these factors to a much greater extent
than plain tubes.
It is somewhat difficult to measure the hardness of
Calorized coatings by the usual methods, because of the
relatively thin coat, and also because of the chemical
gradient, which is also a hardness gradient, existing in

this layer. The Bierbaum scratch hardness test, how-
ever, has yielded very satisfactory results. An ex-
amination of several specimens has indicated that the
section at the base of the ]&gt;orous section possesses the
maximum hardness. The section at the junction of
the case and core, however, is also considerably harder
than the steel itself. The micro-hardness at the sur-
face ranges from 600 to 800, that at the junction from
300 to 400, and that of the steel itself from 150 to 200.
It is evident, therefore, that the increase in hardness,
due to Calorizing, is appreciable.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


For Engineers
PROFESSOR C. T. OLMSTED
Secretary, State Board of Examiners
Recently an engineer came into the office of the
Michigan Board of Engineer Examiners seeking in-
formation and advice relative to registration. He said
that he and some forty other engineers, who were all
employees of a large Michigan corporation, were anx-
ious to become registered and were interested in pre-
paring themselves for the examinations. Most of them
had been out of college for a number of years, and had
therefore decided that it would be necessary for them
to do some intensive reviewing of the various subjects
on the examination schedule. With this in view, they
had organized themselves into classes under the super-
vision of tutors and were about to "go to school" again.
The representative of the group had graduated in 1921,
and he felt that he had quite an ordeal ahead of him.
I have related this incident merely to illustrate how
desirable it is for a young engineer to take his Board
examinations as early in his career as possible. Two of
the three days of the examination are available to him
at the time he graduates and he can complete the re-
mainder after two years of practical experience. Of
course, after four years of college, with its frequent
blue books and many finals, it is only natural that a
person would be "fed up" on examinations. However,
one should be more or less immunized by that time and
a few more tests should not annoy him too much. At
any rate, any inconvenience he may suffer then will
be nothing compared with the ordeal of reviewing a
number of subjects some years later when many of
them may have become extremely hazy through disuse.
The examinations are always given at the Univer-
sity of Michigan and at Michigan State College on the
Thursday and Friday preceding Commencement. This
is a particularly convenient time for seniors, as their
college finals are out of the way and most of them are
merely putting in the time waiting for graduation.
One's time is not very valuable then and a few hours
devoted to the examinations at that time may mean
a great saving in time and ex]&gt;ense a few years later.
Registration has spread very rapidly in the past few
years and the time may come when it will be as uni-
versally necessary for an engineer to be licensed as it
is now for a doctor.
The following are the schedules of those parts of
the examinations which are open to seniors.
First Day Common to All Branches of Engineering
8:30 to 12:30 A.M. Mathematics, Physics, and
General Engineering Problems. Books allowed.
1:30 to 5:30 P.M. Mechanics, Strength of Ma-
terials, Hydraulics. Books allowed.
Second Day for Civil Engineers
8:30 to 12:30. Surveying and Mapping. Books
allowed.
1 :30 to 2:30. Engineering Law and Specifications.
No books allowed.
2:30 to 5 :30. Engineering Drawing. Books allowed.
Second Day far Mechanical Engineers
8:30 to 12:30 A.M. Mechanism, Machine Design.
Thermodynamics. Books allowed.
1:30 to 5 :30 P.M. Heating and Ventilating; Steam
Engines and Power Plants; Internal Combustion En-
gines; Electricity in its application to lighting and
transmission of power. Books allowed.
Experience has repeatedly shown that engineers,
to a great extent, do not practice engineering in their
home state. Although there is a varied group of ex-
aminations of different states available, because of the
very number and the length of each individual exam-
ination, it would be exceedingly illogical to attempt to
publish any state exam, either in whole, or in part in
the MICHIGAN TECH NIC. The TECHNIC, how-
ever, desiring to be of service to the students of engi-
neering has, through the co-operation of Prof. Olm-
sted. been able to obtain two typical state examina-
tions, that of Xew York State and that of Michigan.
These will both be posted on the bulletin 1x&gt;ard on the
fourth floor of the West Engineering Building, just to
the right of the main staircase. It will be worth your
while to inspect these! [En. KOTE|

Rudy contributed the article on
flying in the stratosphere so we are
retaliating by broadcasting his
achievements while here on the
campus. He conies from Negaunee,
-Michigan and (luring his senior
year in high school, he played guard
on the state championship team.
Rudy spent his first two years at
Northern State Teachers College.
Among other things he learned to
fly there and now holds a glider
pilot's license.
At present he is treasurer of the
Aero Branch of the A.S.M.E., and
holds down a ]»sition as an assist-
ant in Engineering Research. He is
also a member of Tau Beta Pi, Phi
Kappa Phi and Sigma Xi. all hon-
orary fraternities. The first two
are for scholarship and the third
for research. Rudy expects to re-
ceive two degrees in June, an Aero-
nautical degree and a Mechanical
degree. We wish him the best of
luck in his chosen life work.
Edward F. jaros
September 30, 1913 saw the birth
of another outstanding senior. This
was none other than Edward F.
Jaros, who claims Chicago as his
permanent residence. Ed was a stu-
dent at l^akefield High School be-
fore coming to Ann Arbor.
Ed began his career as a mem-
ber of the Erosh Frolic committee.
During his sophomore year he won
a second place in the All-Campus
wrestling matches. As a junior Ed
really began to shine. To start with,
he became a Major in the R.O.T.C.,
a member of Scabbard and Blade,
and of the Military Ball committee.
He was also Chairman of the Engi-
neering Honor Committee and a
member of Triangles, junior hon-
orary society.
This year Ed is a Vulcan, secre-
tary of the Transportation Club,
and was a member of the Slide
Rule Dance committee. He is at
present the president of Sigma
Alpha Epsilon. We ho]&gt;e that there
will be a place in the aeronautical
end of Transportation for this up-
and-coming young engineer.

Delbert P. Hesler is the third
Hesler to enroll in the College of
Engineering. One brother, Walter,
finished in '32 in Chemical, and
Harold, a '33 Mechanical, received
his M.S.E. in '34. Del's job has
not been easy, with two outstand-
ing brothers to measure up to.
After spending his first year in
junior college in Kansas City, Del
entered Michigan. Strict attention
to his work, an interest in things
military, and a fine personality be-
gan to bring honors his way. A
Mechanical. Del belongs to Toast-
masters Club. Yulcans, Scabbard
and Blade and Tau Beta Pi. He is
cadet Colonel of the R.O.T.C. unit
and Co-Chairman of the Military
Ball to be held on April 26. As a
junior he was awarded the Army
Ordnance medal for high scholar-
ship.
If present plans materialize,
there will be formed in a few years
the firm of Hesler, Hesler and Hes-
ler, consulting engineers.
Oliver S. Spark
Lakewood, Ohio's contribution
to the Class of 1935. Oliver S.
Spark — "Ollie" — is just an all-
round good fellow. He has dabbled
in a great many things and carried
off honors in all of them.
A member of Sigma Phi Epsilon
fraternity, he won the Clifford B.
Scott Memorial Award for high
scholarship in the chapter last year.
He was a member of the class fi-
nance committee last year and
house treasurer this year.
Triangles and Vulcans chose him
for membership, and two weeks ago
he received the highest undergrad-
uate award, with election to Tau
Beta Pi.
''Ollie" will bring his college
career to a glorious close in his
official capacity as Senior Ball
Committeeman. in June.
George A. Dankers
George A. Dankers is one of the
boys who play with ship models in
that big pond called the Naval
Tank. When not occupied there
you might find him up in the Naval
drawing room where plenty of
"midnight oil" is burned by striv-
ing young naval architects. His
absence from town week-ends can
be explained with the phrase "Cher-
chez la femme."
Really George is a serious person
and a good student. He was pres-
ident of his fraternity, Delta Alpha
Epsilon. this year. He and George
Snyder are the two Marine Engi-
neers who are at present members
of Tau Beta Pi. His paper on the
history of ship propulsion was pub-
lished in the January issue of tin-
Michigan Technic.
Classmates admire George for
his quiet, unassuming manner and
his attention to business. \Ve pre-
dict great success for him in his

MORE ABOUT OPEN HOUSE
An extraordinary possession us-
ually merits the pride of its owner.
Michigan engineers have in their
college a very extraordinary pos-
session indeed, and it is with jus-
tifiahle pride that they put it on ex-
hibition May 17 and 18. These are
the definite dates of the Engineer-
ing Oj&gt;en House.
The various departments of the
college will display to the public on
these two days the latest develop-
ments in all branches of engineer-
ing science. The responsibility of
arranging displays in each depart-
ment has been taken over by the
respective professional societies. Re-
sults to date appear very promis-
ing. In addition to the special dis-
plays the naval tank, wind tunnel,
foundry, class rooms, libraries and
all engineering laboratories will be
open for public inspection. Student
guides will conduct visitors from
a designated central location to the
various exhibits where a member
of the department will give a short
explanatory talk. The hours will be
from 9 A. M. to 6 P. M. on Friday
and 11 P.M. on Saturday. The
date has been set to coincide with
the University Homecoming week
so out of town visitors will be able
to take in both events at the same
time.
The engineers spend a great deal
of time and effort to make Open
House worthy of the large num-
bers who visit it each year and this
promises to be no exception. Tell
vour friends about it.
WE START ANEW
April marks the inauguration of
a new TECHNIC staff. In filling
their new positions the incoming
staff members pledge their utmost
in maintaining the high standards
set uj) by previous TECHNIC
staffs. It is with regret that we see
the passing of three such extremely
capable men as Wagner, Sloane.
and Marshall of the retiring Pub-
lication Board.
Perhaps our readers have some-
times wondered just what mysteri-
ous force it is that makes a man
give a goodly part of his time and
effort in order to help put out a
magazine from which he receives
no financial reward and sometimes
little else in the way of thanks.
Most of us are doing our jobs for
the experience they have to offer,
but it is a rather high price to pay
for experience alone. It is the ad-
ditional satisfaction of knowing
that we are doing something worth
while which really counts. We feel
that the TECHNIC is really a
worth while project and fills a defi-
nite place in the College of Engi-
neering. If it were to be suddenly
discontinued we are certain that the
students in particular would feel
the loss keenly. For that reason we
of the new staff will strive through-
out the coming year to produce a
publication worthy of your support.
Again we remind you that the
TECHNIC is YOUR magazine.
Our reward is the resixjnse we re-
ceive from you.

STRESSES

STRAINS
Prologue:
It is with a great deal of trepidation that I park my
tootsie-wootsies under the desk and proceed to grind
out a hunch of tripe and call it humor. "Oh humor,
what sins are committed in thy name!" I lay no claims
to the mantle of greatness worn by Swift. Twain, Lea-
cock and Joseph "Peter Piper" Penner. As a child. I
was not funny to look at. and it was only because of
fate that I ever got into the gag racket. The art of
lifting things was innate in me and from stealing the
old man's razor it was but a step to stealing jokes.
Soon I was famous and people would nudge their com-
panions on seeing me—then both of them would grab
any convenient brick and heave it.
However, T bore you, as I shall continue to do if
you will persist in reading this. If, then, you recognize
any of these jokes as old friends, remember that they
were beloved by Adam and will continue to be loved
until the day when Gabriel pauses in blowing the horn
and says, "Say, Pete, did I ever tell you the one
about—." Let us then on to the slaughter of the readers
with a quip and who knows—mayhap a laugh.
Wiggy, Stooge of Stooges.
'What's the elastic limit?"

ED CHEMICAL AND DON MECHANICAL
Says Ed Chemical to Don Mechanical,
"This Ch. E. is too tyrannical.
Though oxygen in equals oxygen out
1 still don't know what it's all about."
So What!. Don Mechanical now enquires.
It's nought to what E. M. requires.
One moment here one moment there
About an axis anywhere.
In figuring out this left reaction
One's driven quite to mild distraction;
And even then it's not sufficient
Unless you know that coefficient.
In magnitude and in direction,
You must compute each small deflection.
And then it's quite apt to appear
That you've wholly neglected the shear,
Or was it inertia; I don't know which,
Anyhow this problem sure is a witch.
Ed Chemical in homage bent
Returns once more to his lab content.
Moved greatly by his friend's citations
With courage anew he begins his titrations.
Sadly he looks at his phenolphthalien
This time, he says, there'll be no failing.
And every ion's concentration
Is found; oh, heavenly dispensation!
No unknowns of awful complexity
Will offer for Ed much perplexity
Out to three or four decimal places
The weight of his samples he chases.
He still thinks the course is pure tripe
But admitting at last it's a pipe.
—Dave Eiscndrath
There once was a maiden or Siam,
Who said to her lover young Kiam,
"If you kiss me. of course
You will have to use force.

A city's built with outskirts—a chorus girl is too.

Surveying
PROF. C. T. JOHNSON
The first session of Camp Davis was held at Whit-
more Lake, ten miles north of Ann Arlrar, in 1874.
It is the oldest and hest known surveying camp in the
United States. It moved from place to place as Pro-
fessor Davis was able to make arrangements for a camp
site adjacent to lands where field work could be carried
on. From 1882 to 1928, inclusive, the camp was lo-
cated in the northern part of the southern peninsula
of Michigan. In 1908 the University acquired lands
on Douglas Lake near Cheboygan, Michigan, where
the camp was promised a permanent home. This site
was first occupied in 1909. Due to frequent forest
fires for a number of preceding years, much of the
timber had disappeared by 1909 and the locality was not
altogether unfavorable to field work in surveying.
Serious fires were prevented after the lands came into
the possession of the University. By 1926 field work
was much handicapped by a new growth of trees and
brush. In the meantime a permanent camp had been
established at an approximate cost to the University of
$17,000. It would have been possible for the Uni-
versity to have sold the single forty-acre tract on which
the camp was situated for
from $75,000 to $125,000.
Much of the value of the
camp at that time repre-
sented donated labor, all
students and members of
the staff having taken an
active part in construction
and maintenance.
In 1928 a new site for
the camp was found in the
Jackson Hole Country,
Wyoming, seventy-five
miles south of the Yellow-
stone Park. During the
summers of 1929 and 1930
the University spent $20.-
000 there in actual con-
struction. Like the Camp at
Douglas Lake. Camp Davis
in Wyoming now has a val-
ue much in excess of the
money expended by the
University.
Most of the leading universities of the country have
followed Michigan in the establishment of surveying
camps. It is generally conceded that the University of
Michigan has maintained its leadership and that the
new camp in Wyoming offers the best of instruction in
a region where field work may be carried on with
minimum labor and at minimum cost.
The best test of the value of an educational insti-
tution is obtained when estimates come from former
students. In response to inquiries made of those who
attended the sessions at Douglas Lake, between 85 and
90 per cent report that the summer at Camp Davis was
the most profitable part of their college careers. Prac-
tically all students who have attended the new camp in
Wyoming make a similar report. Camp Davis is not
an experiment. It has weathered many storms. It is an
honorable institution and it merits the support of all
who appreciate good instruction, loyalty to academic
ideals, love of work and a ready acceptance of the
responsibilities that should be assumed by every citizen
of a real camp.

Now that the Spring vacation is gone, there is
nothing to do but wait for June and finals. June to
some of us will mean the leaving of Michigan for the
last time but the majority of us will be back in harness
in September after a real layoff. If you are not near
Ann Arbor we know that you are missing the beautiful
spring weather and the gentle rains. Well, here is some
good news that will bring a little sunshine. The Engi-
neering Open House, discontinued for seven years, will
again be held this year on Friday and Saturday, May
17 and 18.
Plans for this event have been under way for quite
some time and it promises to be a real show. We hope
that many of you alumni living near Ann Arbor will
be able to come and see what the youngest generation
of engineers are doing along professional lines. Come
to the Open House and bring a friend. We know you
will enjoy it.
As the May issue of the Technic will be out in time
for the Open House, we are trying to have a real man-
size Alumni Section to end the school year. Of course
this is one job that depends upon the response from
YOU. We know that you are interested in your old
classmates and that they are interested in you. If you
are too busy to write them a letter why not drop a card
to the Alumni Editor of the Technic. All you have to
do is write down your class, address and present ]&gt;osi-
tion. Of course if you are in the writing mood, you
might tell us about the future wife or if you already
have a helpmate, about the latest additions to the fam-
ily. If we find that yon fellows are succeeding in earn-
ing a living, we might really try to graduate before the
next depression.
The chimes on the Annex have long since rung
live-thirty so we'll be off to supper. See you at the
OPEN HOUSE—MAY 17 and 18.

It's an ultra-short wave radio telephone antenna—before being raised above the
dunes of Cape Cod. O. For some years, Bell System engineers have been studying ultra-
short waves. They have developed automatic transmitters and receivers which may be
connected with regular telephone lines at points far from
central offices. They hope such radio links will be useful
in giving telephone service to points difficult to reach by
usual methods. CL The installation on Cape Cod—which
is now undergoing service tests—is just one more example
of Bell System pioneering in the public interest.

College Review
A. S. C. E.—At the formal initiation held in the
Michigan Union on March 20, the following initiates
were presented: F. H. Chen, S. F. Crook, A. L. Davies,
L. Dworsky, E. Eckardt, L. W. Johnson,
J. J. Newman, T. J. Nordenson, E. Pres-
ton, G. Rugge, H. S. Saffar, and C. G.
Wedell. Dean S. C. Hollister of the
School of Civil Engineering, Cornell Uni-
versity, gave the address of the evening.
His subject was "The Profession of Civil Engineer-
ing." He traced the history of Civil Engineering from
its pioneer, John Smeaton. and indicated the steps
leading to the foundation of the Society of Civil Engi-
neers. A short resume of the life of Thomas Telford,
the second truly civil engineer, exemplified the type of
individual all engineers should try to become.
Last month the members had the opportunity to
review the construction work on the Hetch-Hetchy
Project, the water supply of San Francisco. On March
28, the slides of the Catskill Water Supply were shown.
This is one of the major water supplies of the City of
New Y'ork.
A. S. M. E., Mechanical Division—The student so-
ciety of Mechanical Engineers sponsored a talk by
Col. Miller on March 13, in Natural Science Audi-
torium. The subject was "The Paris
Guns." There were seven of these guns
which fired effectively on Paris from a
vantage point behind the German lines
seventy miles away. The tubing of the guns measured
98 feet in length. The shells weighed 228 pounds and
were fired with a force of nearly 2,000,000 pounds
pressure. The "Paris Guns" have never been equalled
by the Allied powers.

Oxy-acetylene Welding contributes these impor-
tant advantages to the design and manufacture
of metal products.
By W. B. MILLER*
IN THE fabrication of metals it is
not necessary to sacrifice appear-
ance and simplicity for strength.
Modern methods have changed
that. Through the use of welding,
it is now possible, with a mini-
mum investment in equipment, to
fabricate products with strength
where it is wanted. Extra bulk
throughout for reinforcing the
weakest spot is not necessary.
Welded for Strength
The welded joint is as strong as or
even stronger than the metal it
joins. It is leak-proof and thus
For Rigorous Use
For years, field hoes were manu-
factured by a forging and rolling
process involving a considerable
investment in machinery. An en-
terprising hoe manufacturer found
that he could eliminate inherent
weaknesses by welding. He de-
signed a bimetal job: the hoe blade
or a steel made to hold its cutting
edge longer, the sturdy shank of
a steel selected for its ability to
withstand shock and fatigue.
These are then joined by welding
with a bronze welding rod. In this
way there is no compromise—ma-
STRONG JOINTS—95 per cent of all aircraft have oxy-acetylene welded

admirably suited for piping or
containers of any sort, to resist
pressure, temperature, or shock.
Another way of making the prod-
uct stronger is to weld it from one
of the new alloy steels or strong
non-ferrous alloys. In this way
another desirable property is usu-
ally obtained — lighter weight.
Welding can be used to make joints
in any of the commercial metals.
In Aircraft Construction
Outstanding as an example of the
use of welded joints for their
strength is in aircraft manufac-
ture. In an airplane fuselage, every
joint must be strong enough to
withstand heavy stresses from all
sides in flying. The joints must
be tough also, for the shocks they
undergo are sudden as well as
powerful. They are made in a
strong alloy —chrome-molvhdenum
steel. Welded joints are the stand-
ard of the aircraft industry be-
cause they fulfill faithfullv these
essential requirements on which
so many human lives depend.
terials are chosen for the job they
are to do—and the manufacturer
makes a better hoe at lower cost.
In Modern Furniture
In making metal chairs it is nec-
essary to get a strong ductile joint
and one smooth in contour to take
the various special finishes which
are applied to simulate wood. The
strength of joints made with spe-
cial high strength welding rod can
SIMPLE—by adopting weldingfor
these, field hoes, the manufacturer
produces a product with none of
the disadvantages of older designs.
TRIM JOINTS—for metal furni-
ture are made by welding. Chairs
of welded metal easily support as
many heavyweights as can hang on.
support the weight of several stout
men without any sign of giving
way. The welded joints are rounded
and curved so that but little grind-
ing is necessary for a smooth surface.
Welding Is Sound Design
To take advantage of all the fea-
tures of oxy-acetylene welding,
products should be designed or
redesigned with the aid and ad-
vice of competent welding spe-
cialists. Engineers of The Linde
Air Products Company are con-
stantly perfecting details of ox-
welded design which are of in-
terest and assistance to manufac-
turers. Consultation on welded
design can be had without charge
from any Linde Sales Office. They
are located in leading cities of the
country: Atlanta, Baltimore, Bir-
mingham, Boston, Buffalo, Butte,
Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, Den-
ver, Detroit, El Paso, Houston,
Indianapolis, Kansas City, Los
Angeles, Memphis, Milwaukee,
Minneapolis, New Orleans, New
York, Philadelphia, Phoenix,
Pittsburgh, Portland, Ore., St.
Louis, Salt Lake City, San Fran-
cisco, Seattle, Spokane and Tulsa.
Everything for oxy-acetylene
welding and cutting—-including
Linde Oxygen, Prest-O-Lite Acet-
ylene, Union Carbide and Oxweld
Apparatus and Supplies—is avail-
able from Linde tnrough produc-
ing plants and warehouse stocks
in all industrial centers.
With Engineering
Cooperation
Users of oxy-acetylene welding
and cutting, and other products
and processes developed by Units
of Union Carbide and Carbon Cor-
poration benefit from a mostunique
coordination of scientific research
with manufacturing, sales and ser-
vice facilities. These combined
resources of a vast organization
assure a full measure of satisfac-
tory performance.

./. S. M. £., Aero Division—One of the most ac-
tive student organizations on the campus offered an
inspection trip to all aero students on March 9. A
group of students visited the Wayne County Airport
and also made an inspection tour through the Stinson
Aircraft Corp. On March 11 the members viewed
a set of Pan-American moving pictures of "Flying the
Lindbergh Trail."
A. 1. C'li. E.—The Chemical Engineering Society of
the campus sponsored a talk by Mr. Hildorf of the
Timken Steel and Tube Company, who spoke on "Re-

will also be a prize for the Engineering Department
with the most members present, so everyone try to be
there.
TAU BETA PI TAKES NEW MEN
Tau Beta Pi, national engineering honorary society,
gave a banquet on April 2 in honor of a group of new
initiates. The speaker of the evening was Charles F.
Hirschfeld, chief of research of the Detroit Edison
Company, who is an alumnus of the society. Professor
A. D. Moore, Director of Fellowships of Tau Beta Pi.
was toastmaster. and among those who spoke were
Philip A. Singleton, president, Professor Walter C.
Sadler, new president of the Ann Arbor City Council,
and Dean H. C. Sadler of the engineering college.
Those taken into membership were Samuel Bousky,
Rodney W. Devore, William C. Goggin, Oliver Spark,
and Eugene C. Whitney, all seniors selected from the
upper quarter of their class.
From the upper eighth of the junior class were
chosen George Atherton, Rupert Bell, Ralph Bodine,
William Chapman, John De Young, \Villiam Eason,
Robert Merrill, Kenneth Mosier, Joseph Newman, Tor
Nordenson, Robert Pekelsma, and Robert Stevens.
Those admitted to honorary membership were Harry
Brelsford of the Diamond Power Specialty Corp. and
Oscar Horger of the Timken Roller Bearing Co.
George W. Strobe, Sidney C. Singer and Paul K.
Beemer, who had been elected to Tau Beta Pi at
Leland-Stanford University, were initiated as mem-
bers of that chapter.
William C. Goggin received the prize for the best
paper submitted by an initiate and Samuel Bousky re-
ceived honorable mention for the second best paper.

AIRCRAFT INSPECTION TRIP
The morning of March 9 was spent by some forty
Aero Engineers in an inspection trip of the Stinson
Aircraft Plant at Wayne, Michigan, and in a survey of
the Wrayne County Airport. Mr. DeWeese, of the
Stinson Plant, traced the manufacturing processes in-
volved in the manufacture of their airplanes from the
stock room through the fuselage, wing, sheet-metal de-
partments, and the final assembly line. Of special in-
terest were the assembly details of the new Stinson
Tri-motor, the fastest ship of this type in this country
and now in service on American Airlines between
Detroit and Toledo.
Mr. Baker, manager of the Wayne County Airport,
escorted the group on their inspection tour. The Wayne
County airport has the highest possible rating from the
Department of Commerce. Every light on this field
is operated from a control room located in a tower
on the hangar roof, where there is also a public address
and loud speaker system. A radio operator who talks
to radio equip|&gt;ed airplanes is stationed at this point.
The airport is a complete city in itself having its own
power plant, heating system, hotel, restaurant, am-
bulance, and fire-fighting equipment.

MICHIGAN CENTRAL TERMINAL AT DETROIT
On Saturday, March 30, the members of the Trans-
portation Club made their second trip of the year. The
trip was an inspection tour of the Michigan Central
terminal in Detroit and a visit to the classification yard
on Lonyo Ave.
Upon meeting the Trainmaster at the terminal
they were shown the terminal facilities for handling
mail, baggage, and express. From here the man in
charge took them through one of the new air-condi-
tioning cars and the mechanism was explained in de-
tail. The next point visited was the switch control
tower from which the entire system of interlocking
switches in the terminal is operated. Just before they
entered this tower, a fast, coast-to-coast express train

ough inspection of the running gear.
Upon leaving the control tower the entire personnel
boarded one of the electric switching engines used in
the terminal and were taken through the railroad tun-
nel under the Detroit River to Windsor. Here in the
Windsor yards the engine collected a train of freight
cars and returned to Detroit. Even though the grades
at both ends of the tunnel are between 3 and 4% the
trip was made at nearly 35 miles per hour.
From the main terminal the group went out to the
westbound classification yards at Lonyo Ave. Here
they climbed into the control tower and watched the
operation of the switches and automatic car retarders.
All this operation was taken care of by one man who
operated about eight switches and all the car retarders.
The cars came off the hump in a certain order and the
name and number of the car was conveyed to the
tower by teletype. All the towers are connected by
a loud speaker system. The man in charge of the oper-
ations said that the application of the retarders is
merely a matter of the weight of the car. This he does
not know but estimates as the car passes him. The
use of these car retarders enables the classification
yards to handle nearly five cars a minute during rush
hours. With riders on each car this rate of handling
could never be attained.
After watching the operation of the hump yard for
a while, the members found it necessary to leave for
Ann Arbor. As the terminal at Detroit is quite large
it is possible that another trip may be made to see the
rest of the terminal some time in May. It is also
expected that the members of the club will have an
opportunity to visit the Detroit City Airport on their
next visit to Detroit.

Stewed : "Judging from the physiological effect based
on experimental evidence, I should say that whatsoever
its quantitative value might lie, its specific gravity,
qualitatively speaking, is negative."
CALORIZINC STEEL
(Continued from f&gt;uyc 130)
Calorizing does not adversely influence the usual
physical properties. Tensile tests have indicated that
the strength characteristics; that is, the tensile strength,
yield point and proportional limit, are somewhat in-
creased, while the ductility is slightly lowered. Also,
if a suitable heat-treatment is employed, the impact
resistance of a Calorized steel is approximately equal
to that of the base metal.
Because of the desirable combination of properties,
it is believed that the application of Calorized steels
will be widely extended during the next few years.
Special application should lie made in tubes and in
those cracking stills which treat sour crudes, that is,
crudes high in sulphur compound. Considerable work
is now in progress in an attempt to further improve the
Calorizing operation. Coatings should soon be available
which will possess even more ductility than the present
ones.
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS ON THE GRAIN
SIZE OF STEEL
Mr. Hildorf, Chief Metallurgist of the Timken
Steel and Tube Company, spoke Thursday evening,
February 14, at an A. I. Ch. E. meeting, on the subject
of grain size of steel. In his lecture Mr. Hildorf
dealt not only with metallurgical practice in the steel
plant, but also with considerations to be taken into
account when ordering steel used in modern practices.
An important condition of steel in conjunction with
grain size is its abnormality. This abnormal condition
was discovered while investigating soft spots in ball
bearing races, and it is manifested by a discontinuity
of grain boundaries. It may be produced in either
coarse or fine grained steel. Abnormality is undesir-
able in case-hardened steel, and care must be taken
to prevent the presence of this condition when case
hardening. Grain size very markedly affects harden-
ability. Large grained steels harden much deeper than
small grained steels. By varying the grain size, a
piece of steel may be hardened uniformly throughout
its thickness, or made much harder at the surface than
in the middle.
Mr. Hildorf stated that after further work on
grain size and abnormality is done, plain carbon steels
will replace alloy steels to a large extent—especially
in the automotive industry. Aluminum is the most im-
portant constituent in controlling grain size. Tests
carried on in machine shops show that there is no
preference as to grain size, but that the tools must
be adjusted to this factor. Hence, a machinist ac-
customed to fine grained steel would have difficulty
with a coarser grained piece of steel unless he changed
his cutting tool.

From the name "Spring Homecoming" it is appar-
ent that we are giving Alumni an opportunity to return
to the campus to renew old friendships and talk over
the experiences of their undergraduate days, and to
remark that College is no longer "What it used to be."
We feel, however, that that is merely our of the aims
of Spring Homecoming.
Every year hundreds of Freshmen enter the Uni-
versity of Michigan with the rather vague purpose of
"going to College." Perhaps they plan to take Engi-
neering, or Law, or Medicine because some friend or
relative belonged to one of these professional groups,
or possibly they heard someone talk on that subject
and they became fired with a somewhat blinded enthusi-
asm to take up its study. Nothing could be more fool-
ish, yet it is being done all over the country every
year. When a man goes to college he is investing
several thousand dollars and four or more of the best
years of his life, and he should at least make some »-*"
investigation before making such an investment.
Spring Homecoming gives prospective students, j
their parents, and their friends, just this opportunity —^
to study the university as a whole and in detail while
it is in operation, and to determine at least partially
which department best suits their own tastes and de-
sires. This is especially true this year for prospective
engineering students, for the Engineering Open House
provides ample opportunity to examine the work of
each field of engineering, and at the same time derive
a great deal of pleasure and interest therefrom.
We extend a most cordial invitation to everyone to
visit the campus for Spring Homecoming the week-
end of May 17, 18, 19, and trust that you will find your
stay pleasant, educational, and profitable.

MAKING FLAWS SQUAWK
AVALVE used in a General Electric refrigerator
unit requires a small steel spring, which, (luring
the lime that a refrigerator is in operation, is used
several hundred times {&gt;er minute. A small defect,
even a microscopic scratch, would be sufficient to
cause the spring to fail after a relatively small
number of operations. Consequently a fast, certain
means of inspection for the steel ribbon of which the
springs are made was necessary.
It is generally known that, if a secondary coil is
placed around a core of iron and the iron is placed
in a magnetic field, there is a definite relation between
the chemical and physical properties of the iron
and the resultant electrical wave induced in the
secondary coil. Using this knowledge as a base, a
General Electric laboratory built an inspection
device. The spring material is run through a mag-
netic field, and the induced current is fed through an
amplifier to a loudspeaker. A hum peculiar to the
magnetic properties of the material sounds in the
loudspeaker as long as the quality of the material
is uniform. Any flaw, however, changes the magnetic
properties, the magnetic field then becomes un-
balanced, and the loudspeaker emits a shrill squawk.

STREAMLINE COMMUTING
PPORTLAND-BOSTON commuters will shortly re-
ceive a taste of real speed. Fairly before they have
a chance to swallow their breakfasts, they will be
whisked into North Station by the "Flying Yankee."
In the morning, the train will streak the 115 miles
from Portland, Maine, to Boston in 110 minutes.
Then during the day, it will make a round trip to
Bangor, Maine, making the 250-mile trip each way
in 265 minutes. When the business day closes, it
will streak back up Portland way with the com-
muters it brought down in the morning.
The "Flying Yankee" is a 200-foot articulated train,
of lightweight, stainless-steel construction. Its three
sections arc carried on four trucks. Power originates
in a 600-horscpowcr Diesel engine, directly con-
nected with a General Electric generator. Two
General Electric traction motors are mounted in the
first truck. An auxiliary generator and the control
equipment are also built by General Electric.
HOT DOG
P)EG is an elderly English setter, who can trace her
family back to some of the very best nobility
in her breed. When she was younger, she enjoyed
nothing more than romping about in the snow. But
in the last few years, American winters, with all
their sub-zero weather, have not agreed with her
too well.
So last year, her owner, II. C. Ward, U. of Wisconsin,
'05, of the General Electric office in Rochester,
N. Y., decided to heat her kennel. Quite appropri-
ately, he decided to do the job electrically. He in-
stalled a length of G-E soil-heating cable, plugged
it into an outlet, and turned on the juice.
He did not stop there, however. Such a fine old dog
deserved a polished job. He also installed a G-E
thermostat in Peg's quarters to keep the temperature
constant through all kinds of weather. Now while
other dogs cower in frosty kennels, she disposes
herself in luxury. She wags her thanks to General
Electric.

INCESSANTLY the call for progress stimulates the
field of engineering; and, this call is always heeded.
The progress in this field since the turn of the cen-
tury is self-evident; furthermore, it is far in excess
of what the most eminent thinkers of that time pre-
dicted. This advance has been made largely because
the institutions that educate the engineers have prog-
ressed. Among these Michigan has been most con-
spicuous. Improvements in laboratory facilities and
shops, encouragement of research, and changes toward
better methods of teaching have kept Michigan in the
lead. The Department of Engineering Research, with
its many varied activities, has been another factor in
our development. These factors have brought to Ann
Arbor thousands of men who are now leaders in
directing this phenomenal progress of engineering.
THE TECH NIC feels justly proud in presenting this
group of articles describing the history, development,
and functions of the various departments of the
College of Engineering. These articles, by the pro-
fessors who direct the destinies of Michigan men, to-
gether with the illustrations of our laboratories and
shops, vividly depict the progress in Engineering at
Michigan.
THE WORK OF THE DEPARTMENT OF
CHEMICAL AND METALLURGICAL
ENGINEERING
Prof. A. H. White
The manufacture of an automobile tire is a com-
plex operation involving many branches of engineer-
ing. The man who controls the design and the process
of manufacture must be familiar with the properties

of rubber when compounded with various materials
and vulcanized at different temperatures. He must
know what reinforcing materials to add to the mix,
how to bond the rubber firmly to the cotton fibers
and must understand the action of accelerators and
antioxidants. That is saying in a rather round-about
way that the man who decides how, an automobile tire
shall be made must be a chemical engineer. If a
stainless steel is to be manufactured the man in charge
must know the effect of various alloys when incor-
porated with iron containing different percentages of
carbon. He must be familiar with the action of slags
and of oxidizing and reducing atmospheres in the
melting furnace. He must decide the heat treatment
to be given the product in order that it may have a
fine grain size and the desired strength and ductility,
as well as resistance to corrosion.
The chemical industry embraces a field much wider
than the manufacture of what are known as "chemi-
cals." Whenever chemical reactions enter in an
important way into manufacturing operations, the
process should be controlled by the chemical or the
metallurgical engineer. It is only within recent years
that sufficient knowledge has been accumulated to per-

Indicating one bank of cylinders on a Liberty airplane engine under air starting
mit a chemical process to be designed with the same
accuracy as a bridge. In our modern petroleum plants
a single still may handle 20,000 barrels of crude
petroleum, a day, splitting this raw material into gaso-
line, lubricating oil and other fractions. The designers
of these stills feel that if the heat balance of the still
and its distillation columns does not come within two
per cent of their estimates, they have not done a good
job.
The laboratories of the Department of Chemical
and Metallurgical Engineering are in the East Engi-
neering Building whose top floor is devoted wholly
to the subject of fuels and metals. On this floor is
the foundry of the Department of
Metal Processing as well as the metal-
lurgical laboratories with their melting
furnaces, the laboratory for examina-
tion of polished metals microscopic-
ally and for determination of the
crystal structure as revealed by X-ray
analysis. The high pressures and
tem]X'ratures now in use in boiler
plants and oil cracking plants are
limited only by the ability of the metal
to stand up under these severe con-
ditions. There are unusual facilities
provided for high temperature testing
and long time "creep" tests. The fuel
laboratories have facilities for tests of
fuels for composition and heating
value. The research laboratories con-
tain rooms for testing the properties of
automotive fuels and for experiments
in gas manufacture from solid fuels.
The general laboratories of the
department form a group starting on
the third floor of the north wing and
running through to the basement.
They contain equipment on a semi-
commercial scale which permits tests
on the unit operations such as evapo-
ration, filtration and distillation. It is
jxDssible with this equipment to obtain
quite accurate data on yields and effi-
ciencies which can be used in the
design of full scale equipment.
Smaller laboratories are devoted
to research in the various divisions of
chemical engineering. There is a
group of rooms for pulp and paper
manufacture and another for paint,
varnish and protective coatings. Other
rooms provide space where graduate
students and members of the staff can
bring together the special equipment
needed for the study of their individ-
ual problems.
The provisions for these laboratories which were
incorporated in the design of the East Engineering
Building have worked out well and although the de-
partment of Chemical and Metallurgical Engineering
is now somewhat crowded for space, the laboratories
are still regarded as superior in arrangement and
equipment.

(a) Steam Povjcr Engineering deals
with the theory, design, construction,
and operation of the various forms of
prime movers using steam as their mo-
tive power, and their applications in the
modern power house. Under this
heading may be included the problems
of combustion of fuels, the applica-
tion of power and steam in industrial
plants.
(b) Internal Combustion Engi-
neering deals with the design, con-
struction, and operation of all kinds
of engines using gas, oil or gasoline
to generate the motive power; the
different types of gas producers, and
the application of this form of engine
to the generation of power for many
purposes. The present day use of the
internal combustion engine is applica-
ble in many forms and in many fields
of power generation.
(c) Hydro-Mechanical Engineering covers all
types of prime movers using water as the motive power.
It includes the design, construction and operation of
the mechanical equipment in hydro-power stations, also
the design and construction of reciprocating and cen-
trifugal pumps.
(d) Heating and Ventilating Engineering deals
with the theory, design, installation, testing and oper-
ation of heating, ventilating, air conditioning and air
cooling plants for large buildings, theaters and homes.
In many cases manufacturing processes involving air
conditioning are of major importance.

cooling. The field of domestic refrigeration today is
one of major importance.
(f) Automotive Engineering—The University of
Michigan has a strategic location at the center of the
automobile industry in this country, and particular
attention has been directed toward the development
of work in the automotive field. The study includes
the theory, design, operation, and maintenance of the
automobile and other automotive equipment, including
trucks, busses, tractors, and the power plant for all
types of aircraft; also the design and construction of
the chassis for all automotive equipment.
(g) Industrial Engineering deals
with the industrial plant operation,
management, efficiency and safety
methods, production and the busi-
ness side of manufacturing. Par-
ticular attention is paid to time
study, rate setting and the flow of
materials through various types of
plants.
(h) Machine Design — While
design is necessary in practically all
branches of Mechanical Engineer-
ing, there is also the general field
for the man who wishes to follow
machine design either as a technical
designer or as a manufacturer of
machinery. The demand and appli-
cation of automatic machinery by
industry has established a definite
need for good designers.

ment is one of great importance to industry, and the
need for men with a proper and hroad training in
engineering science is increasing each year. Men with
a technical background and the ahility to develop or
invent machines and processes hased on correct and
sound scientific principle are in great demand.
In each of these several fields are highly specialized
branches that appeal to certain students, particularly
proficient in what may he called a rather narrow field.
While a student is not discouraged against following
such a course of study it is believed that better results
will be obtained by a broad and well-rounded course.
This department recognizes that the principal
benefits to be derived from
a college training are de-
pendent more upon the
character of the instruction
than on physical equip-
ment. The importance of
certain apparatus for pur-
poses of illustration, dem-
onstration, and testing, is
however apparent in some
lines of work, and the De-
partment includes a suffi-
cient amount of laboratory
instruction to properly sup-
plement the work of the
class room.
The laboratories of the
Mechanical Engineering
Department are the auto-
motive, steam, gas, refrig-
eration and hydro-mechan-
ics, all well-equipped for
class purposes, special test-
ing and research.
Our graduates will be found in practically every
state of the Union and a number in foreign countries;
many of them hold high positions in the fields of in-
dustry, finance, utility, transportation and govern-
ment.
DEPARTMENT OF NAVAL
ARCHITECTURE AND
MARINE ENGINEERING
Prof. Edward M. Bragg
The Department of Naval Architecture and Marine
Engineering in planning out its course of study has
had in mind the fact that the basic work is similar to
that in mechanical engineering, with the slight differ-
entiation largely in the fourth year. As a ship represents
a floating power plant, fundamental courses in civil,
The Photometric Laboratory equipped for research in both
natural and artificial illumination
electrical, and chemical engineering are also included.
While recognizing the fact that, in the shipbuilding
and shipping industry, men are eventually segregated
into the above groups, it has been thought advisable to
devote more time to the essentials of the subject, rather
than to undue specialization in any one, and to give the
student as broad a background as possible. If, however,
further specialization is desired, it is recommended
that the student return for a fifth year and enter the
Graduate School. Facilities for research work are
provided in the Naval Tank, or Marine Laboratory,
which is unique in this institution.
The Naval Tank is 300 feet long and 22 feet wide,
with a depth of water of 10 feet. At the south end
is a model room and work-
shop for the purpose of
making models of vessels.
The models used in the
tank for testing purposes
are from 8 to 12 feet, and
are made of paraffin wax.
A clay mould is first made
approximately to the shape
desired, and a core in-
serted. The paraffin is
then poured into the mould
and, after cooling, the
rough model is taken to
the model cutting machine.
This machine consists es-
sentially of two moving
tables or platforms, upon
one is placed the model and
upon the other the drawing
of the finished model. The
model moves under a pair
of rotating cutters, which
are made to follow the lines of the drawing. After
cutting, it is brought to its final shape by hand, care-
fully weighed and sufficient ballast added to bring it
to any desired draft and displacement.
The Tank is spanned by a motor-driven traveling
truck which can be run at any desired speed. Upon
this truck are mounted the dynamometers for measur-
ing the forces on the model as it is drawn through the
water at different speeds.
Research work in a naval tank is no different from
research work in general. It consists of about 99%
drudgery and possibly 1% thrill, or "story." Towing
models at speeds ranging from one to three miles per
hour for countless miles does not give rise to many
thrills in this age of speed.
The operation of the Tank is divided between rou-
tine testing and research work. The latter is usually
initiated by some member of the staff and the results are
published in the proceedings of the national society-
Most of the routine testing work comes from builders
who have already decided upon the lines of the vessel

to drive the form. A little experimental work before
the lines are finally determined often saves from 5 to
10 per cent of the total power.
In addition to the towing of ship-shaped forms,
the Tank engages in other types of research. At the
present time the rolling qualities of different forms
are being tested by means of special electrical record-
ing apparatus.
The question of friction is a perennial source of
trouble to the naval architect. While we know in a
general way the resistances which different surfaces
will develop when towed through the water, we find
that friction is so sensitive to the temperature of
water and the degree
or turbulence that it is
difficult to reconcile re-
sults obtained by differ-
ent experimenters. Quite
a number of experi-
ments have been made
in the Tank lately in
studying friction, not
only by towing different
surfaces through the
water but also by means
of a torsional dynamo-
meter.

DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING RESEARCH,
WHAT IT IS AND WHAT IT IS DOING
Assoc. Prof. C. W. Good
The University has many laboratories scattered
through its various instructional departments. Most of
these laboratories possess equipment of exceptional
character, particularly for research work. While these
facilities are essential for good instruction, they are only
used a portion of the time for that purpose. Prior
to the establishment of the Department of Engineering
Research there had been an increasing demand on the
part of industry for permission to use these facilities.
The University authorities were cognizant of their
obligation to the citizens of the State and to the indus-
tries upon which the citizens depended for livelihood
to render every service they could in education and
research, and therefore, establish the Department to
act as liason between industry and the University
laboratories. This was done in 1920.
The problem of organizing the Department and of
working out the details of the service it would render
to industry was given to Professor A. E. White when
he was made Director of the Department at its incep-
tion. At that time there were very few educational
organizations of a similar nature in existence which
could serve as a pattern for the one Professor White
was expected to develop.
He appreciated that no matter how good the equip-
ment might be. the real value of research lay in the
personnel which conducted it. The teaching personnel
of the University contained many men of exceptional
research ability and the Department was organized in
such a way that the teaching ])ersonnel of the various
technical and science departments formed the nucleus
of a technical personnel for the new Department. The
setup of the organization was such, however, that when-
ever the demands of the Research Department upon
the teachers' time reached the point where they were
interfering with his instructional duties, it was possible
for the Department to
employ research workers
who could assist the fac-
ulty men in carrying the
researchload. Thistypeof
organization has worked
out quite successfully.
Members of the staff of
every department in the
Engineering College, as
well as quite a number
of men employed on the
staffs of the Literary
College and the other
schools and colleges,
have at one time or an-
other been employed on
work in the Department
of Engineering Research.
The types of research work carried on by the De-
partment are quite varied. Some are very fundamental
in nature. A great many, however, are of the develop-
mental or experimental type, in which experimentation
is necessary in order to develop a manufacturing process
of a new product.
Another type of problem consists in finding why
certain things happen, or do not happen as the case
may be, that is, why certain laws of nature are appar-
ently violated. Problems of this sort sometimes become
quite fundamental.
Because of its exceptional equipment, the Univer-
sity is sometimes called upon to perform tests which,
if the equipment were general, would be considered
as routine tests and of no standing as research.
That the service rendered by the Department is
one which industry appreciates is attested to by the
fact that the Department has been called upon to work
on more than one thousand projects since it was
formed in 1920. Although there are some projects
which do not last more than two weeks or a month
there have been other projects which have run for a
period of eight to ten years in which very extensive
studies have been carried out.

prove of economic benefit to the man-
ufacturer sponsoring the researches if
they are to continue using the research
services offered by the University
through its Department of Engineer-
ing Research because they reimburse
the University for its expenses in con-
ducting the research projects. The
fact that twice as much work is l&gt;eing
sponsored in the Department this year
as last is significant.
The Wind Tunnel, 8 feet in diameter, has a maximum Velocity of 110 miles per hour
Industry is not the only group that is benefited,
however. Engineering students and others gain
through the fact that their teachers have been better
able to keep abreast with industrial developments
through their contact with industry made possible
through the Department of Engineering Research.
Some of them also gain directly through being em-
ployed on research projects in the capacity of assistants.
With some, this gain may be purely monetary, but in
mos't cases it really comes as much from the added
experience as from the remuneration they receive.
The individual citizen also gains, although this is
not usually made as apparent to him as it might be.
If he is a farmer, it is quite possible that his cream
separator is one of a make which has l)een made more
quiet through research work at the University. It is
quite possible that the spark plugs in his automobile
are more efficient because of the work done here on
spark plug electrodes.
The housewife, who enjoys a quiet, efficient re-
frigerator, probably does so because of work which
was done in the University laboratories on the quieting
of refrigerators and because of the work on single
phase motors which led to the development of the effi-
cient starting and quiet type of single phase motor,
now extensively used for driving household appli-
ances.
Research at the University aided in the develop-
ment of shatter-proof glass for automobile use. The
University has likewise aided several manufacturers in
the production of parts for automobiles which were
much quieter than those used before.
The gasoline which you buy for your automobile
may have been improved by work done here. Work
done here may result in a better or less expensive paint
than the one you are now using. The next radio tubes
you buy may have longer life or may be more efficient
or both because of work done through this Department.
The Department now has fifty active projects, many
of which will benefit the citizens to the same degree
as the examples given.
All of these benefits must in a sufficient measure
OUR AERONAUTICAL ENGINEERING
DEPARTMENT
Burdell L. Springer
Established less than twenty years ago, the Aero-
nautical Engineering Department now ranks consist-
ently third in enrollment. This speaks very well indeed
for this newcomer into the field of engineering.
Our Aeronautical Engineering Department has the
distinction of being among the first in the United States
to grant degrees in this profession. The first degree
from our Department is that of Bachelor of Science,
awarded to Mr. F. E. Loudy, as of the Class of 1916.
Mr. Loudy did not actually receive his degree in 1916.
He volunteered his services in the World War and
was unable to complete certain requirements for gradu-
ation. He was, however, awarded his degree at a later
date, as of his particular class. The first regular degree
was granted in 1917 to Mr. W. F. Gerhardt who, inci-
dentally, obtained his Master's degree in Aeronautical
Engineering the following year and subsequently the
first Doctorate to be granted from this Department,
thus clinching all honors.
Enrollment increased slowly from 1918 up to 1927
at which time the graduating class numbered ten. In
three years this number tripled. Finally, in 1933, four-
ty-three students were given Bachelors degrees. This
number is the high point. From 1933 on there has
been a general decrease in the size of the graduating
classes. This trend is a hopeful sign for the future,
for it indicates that fewer students are being attracted
to this field purely by romantic and novel interests. The
large increases from 1928 on may be a result of the
"I.indberg Era," during which many students chose
the field of aeronautical engineering as a field of spe-
cialization merely because it held promise of high
adventure.
Eighteen years is an extremely short time in which
to establish a sound science out of a fancy that has
existed in the minds of men for centuries. Despite the
handicap of a short time for growth, we find that the
aeronautical industry is today rapidly becoming a very
important part of the world's business. In almost every

holding a position of responsibility. The fact that our
graduates are figuring so prominently in this expansion
is a pride to all of us.
The various courses offered in the Aeronautical
Engineering curriculum are being constantly altered
and improved to keep pace with a rapidly moving indus-
try. As a result each graduate finds that he is very
well equipped in a technical sense and that he has an
exceptionally sound foundation upon which to begin
his professional growth. One need only observe the
rapid advancement of several of our recent graduates
to be aware of this fact. Frequently Michigan gradu-
ates, just out of college, are given the task of super-
vising the actual designing of new airplanes, many of
which cost many thousands of dollars. Michigan men
have the advantage of using some of the best apparatus
in the world for studying Aeronautical Engineering
and consequently, with the experience gained and the
self-confidence developed they are able to adapt them-
selves to almost any position in the industry.
DEPARTMENT OF
TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING
Prof. Walter Sadler
Transportation is the very foundation upon which
an intensive industrial development is based. The bring-
ing of raw materials to industrial centers and the dis-
tribution of finished products requires an efficient and
economical transportation system.
Many believe that the great industrial development
of the United States is materially due to the modern
transportation facilities which this country has enjoyed
for the past century. It is certainly a fact that the
American railway system is unexcelled by that of any
other country. The rates are lower and the quality
of service offered is higher than that in any other
country. At the present time, the American transpor-
tation system is undergoing a marked period of tran-
sition. Excepting the heavy tonnage of ore on the Great
Lakes, the real backbone of the transportation system
is the railroad industry. It is carrying now, as it
always has, the bulk of the freight of the country.
Americans are experiencing very marked changes, how-
ever, in their transportation industry.
The private automobile is offering a particularly
flexible form of passenger service, with the result that
it is developing into a great factor in the transporta-
tion field. Statistics indicate that the growth of private
automobile travel is far in excess of the loss of rail-
way passenger business, which establishes rather clearly
that the American public is traveling much more today
than it did two decades ago. The short haul freight
business is being taken up partially by the automotive
truck. The airplane is offering specialized service in
express, passenger and mail service. At the present
time, the railroads are spending extensive sums in the
problem of improving their rolling stock, both in the
matter of speed and weight of equipment. The railway-
track is much improved, and capable of better service.
The highway network of concrete roads is expanding
to all parts of the country, presenting new and complex
problems of traffic control.
It is evident from these considerations that the field
of transportation is a most important and live one, and
that a careful study is necessary to properly correlate
the various functions of our transportation system.
The University of Michigan, through its various
laboratories and Transportation Library, is unusually
well equipped to offer the mechanical provisions neces-
sary for instruction in this branch of engineering. The
personnel of the faculty assigned to this field of study
has been chosen from men equipped, through long years
of experience, to grasp and instruct in the broader
concepts of the field of transportation. The student
is continually guided along those lines of thought which
are based upon the application of sound business prin-
ciples to this extensive industry, and the University can
well point with pride to the success of its graduates
in the transportation system of the United States. The
Transportation courses are designed to train students
for executive positions in this field, and should appeal
particularly to those gifted with sound business judg-
ment.
DEPARTMENT OF CIVIL ENGINEERING
Prof. L. M. Cram
Civil Engineering deals primarily with the design
and construction of public works, or of projects in-
tended to promote the welfare of groups of people
having common interests.
The oldest of the engineering professions, Civil
Engineering, has a fascinating historical background.
It began in this country with the location of land boun-
daries, intercommunicating roads and the construction
of terminals for water transportation. Surveys of tin-

The Transportation Library, 100,000 units dealing with every
phase of transportation
settled territory sometimes preceded and again fol-
lowed the westward migration of the more sturdy and
adventurous of our pioneer citizens. Presently, how-
ever, the need of a trade outlet for inland products
became pressing, and the challenge went forth to a
small group of self-educated men who called themselves
civil engineers as distinguished from military engineers
because their energies were devoted to commissions of
peace time significance, to prepare plans for artificial
waterway service. Thus began an era of canal building
of which the Erie Canal, a stupendous undertaking at
the time, was the first large project and almost the last,
as it so happened that railways were introduced in
England with promise of success in the same year the
Erie Canal was officially opened to traffic throughout
its entire course from Lake Erie to the Hudson River.
The attention of the civil engineer was then diverted-
to the location and construction of railways, the second
chapter in the history of his activities, which played
such an important part in a half-century period of pro-
gress in the country. One might have pertinently
perdicted that after the strategic artificial waterways
and railways were completed, there was little left for
the civil engineer to do. Other chapters, however, were
to follow. For example, the advent of the automobile
revolutionized our habits of transportation for recre-
ational as well as commercial purposes, incidentally
bringing problems to the civil engineer of even greater
magnitude than the canals or railways. Highways of
unprecedented design, and of new materials, were pro-
jected and built, and even now after twenty-five years
of service, many are in process of replacement because
of obsolescence and inadequacy. The art and science of
subway and bridge construction have also progressed to
a remarkable degree under the stimulus of modern
transportation needs. Indeed, one who might have the
temerity not so many years ago to suggest that a bridge
would some day be constructed with a clear span nearly
a mile long, as is now in process, would have been sus-
pected of mental instability- Before digressing from
the contributions of the civil engineer in the field of
transportation, one should not fail to note the ever
present demand for his service in the improvement of
waterways for purposes of navigation, of which the
Panama Canal is an outstanding example.
Problems growing out of congested areas of popu-
lation have likewise tested the skill and ingenuity of
the civil engineer. People in communities may live in
primitive fashion for a time, but presently public health
as well as comfort and convenience demands public
service. Epidemics of contagious diseases, for example,
can be combatted effectively only by removal of the
causes, and polluted water supply is a frequent offender.
Therefore, properly designed and operated water sup-
ply and sewage systems are not considered prime neces-
sities in every community. Unusual buildings have
also been demanded in the congested areas of our large
cities, and the proportioning of structural material in-
cident thereto has been the subject of extended research
on the part of the civil engineer, also providing attrac-
Civil Engineers testing group capacity of piles
tive opportunities for employment in office and field.
The manipulation of the flow of water in our rivers
and lakes for power development, irrigation, flood con-
trol and conservation, provides interesting employment
for a large number of civil engineers. Projects for
those purposes estimated to cost nearly half a billion
dollars are in process of construction, of which Boul-
der Dam. now practically completed, is the greatest
construction venture of world history.
A large percentage of civil engineers find their way
to public service in behalf of the federal government
or of smaller political units. That trend is likely to
increase in the future. In other words the prospect of
greater participation on the part of the government in
community service is fairly definite, and perhaps it is
not too much to expect that policies of administration
will be firmly established whereby capable young engi-
neers with training in various vocations may enter any
branch of public service, confident in the belief that

and continuity of employment will compare favorably
with the practice of our most highly respected private
industries in dealing with their personnel.
DEPARTMENT OF ELECTRICAL
ENGINEERING
Prof. H. H. Higbie
Electrical engineering affects every phase of living.
Henry Ford was quoted by The Electrical World (July
20, 1929) as saying: "We have not yet fully realized
that the function of the workman is to direct power,
not to exert it. We are closer to that realization in
industry than in agriculture or in housekeeping. . . .
The electrical age is here. We are in it now. . . . The
necessary tools are forged and ready, and what we have
to do is to use them in order to bring about the im-
mense social and economic benefits of electricity that
are now clearly apparent to us." This keen commen-
tator, himself a creator of new things and a trans-
former of life through them, sees many opportunities
for service by electrical engineers.
But professional practice is not the only, perhaps not
even the chief field inviting the graduate from this
department of the engineering college. Electrical En-
gineering (Feb., 1932) quotes C. F. Hirshfeld, Chief
of Research for the Detroit Edison Company as say-
ing: "To me a real engineer is a scientifically trained
business man, but the scientific training is of a variety
which leads him to apply the results obtained by scien-
tists rather than to expand the fields of science. This
new specimen, the engineer, represents a new type of
thought. He has learned that action is best based upon
the fullest and most accurate determination of facts
possible at the time and under the given conditions.
He endeavors to hold himself clear of the influence of
preconceived ideas, traditions, prece-
dents, rules-of-thumb." Wre find, in
all branches of business, graduates of
this department who say that the train-
ing in clear and objective thinking to
which we hel|&gt;ed them was an invalu-
able aid to the success they have
achieved.
Measurements and calculations are
the essence of an engineer's analytical
and creative work, and this is pre-
eminently true of electrical engineer-
ing. The best mathematical minds have
chosen to apply themselves to the
development of electrical science, and
have made it particularly attractive
and profitable to the student with pro-
nounced mathematical ability and in-
terest. In no other field is it so apparent that "The book
of Nature is written in numbers; the harmony of things
is that of the number system. All is arranged by God
according to measure and number; all life is an un-
folding of mathematical relations" (A History of
Philosophy, by Windelband-Tufts; see Science, April
19, 1929, p. 426). Millikan says: "Indeed, from my
point of view of that ancient philosopher (Pythago-
ras), the problem of all natural philosophy is to drive
out qualitative conceptions and to replace them by
quantitative relations. And this point of view has been
emphasized by the far-seeing throughout all the his-
tory of physics clear down to the present."
This Department of Electrical Engineering devotes
its best energies to the education of its undergraduate
students, trying to assure them a practical mastery of
the fundamental principles involved by all specializa-
tions within the field; nevertheless, it has been our
policy for many years also to expect each memljer of
our teaching staff to maintain himself a master of some
particular specialization about which he speaks as an
authority in advanced courses designed primarily for
graduate students. Our staff members are all engaged
in investigations in their respective fields of specializa-
tion, whereby they provide opportunities for training
in research work for those students who are inclined
that way. No one has expressed better than the artist
Rockwell Kent (in his book "N by E") the inspira-
tion for this phase of our work: "Who can deny the
human soul its everlasting need to make the unknown
known: not for the sake of knowing, not to inform
itself or be informed or wise, but for the need to exer-
cise the need to know? W;hat is that need but the imag-
ination's hunger for the new and raw materials of its
creative trade? Of things and facts assured to us and
known we've got to make the best, and live with it.

fantastic and unreal moments of beauty which our
thoughts may build upon the passing panorama of
experience."
The cultural value of the training we seek to give
may be most important. In addressing the British As-
sociation for the Advancement of Science (Time, news
magazine, Oct. 5, 1931), General Jan Smuts said:
"Among the human values thus created science ranks
with art and religion. In its selfish pursuit of truth,
in its vision of order and beauty, it partakes of the
quality of both. More and more, it is beginning to make
a profound esthetic and religious appeal to thinking
people. Indeed, it may fairly be said that science is
perhaps the clearest revelation of God to our age.
Science is at last comnig into its own as one of the
supreme goods of the human race." And Dr. K. T.
Compton, distinguished physicist and president of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, believes that:
"In the present as well as in the Stone Age or the
Bronze Age, man's culture largely is expressed and
limited by his tools. The branches of engineering epi-
tomize man's ability to think clearly, accurately and
purposefully. These are some of the reasons for con-
sidering properly balanced engineering studies as a real
'liberal' or 'cultural' as well as a professional educa-
tion."
The professional spirit which we try to stamp indel-
ibly upon the character of our students, is sorely needed
by the business world today. Compton says: "The state
of civilization of any people is measured by the degree
to which they are willing to forego their present desires
for the sake of their future welfare." Speaking espe-
cially to the utility industry, Professor Cabot of Har-
vard said (Electrical World, Oct. 24, 1931 ) :"The only
men who can now lead the industry to success are men
who will work for wages and whose sole profit or re-
ward is in the satisfaction of seeing the work well done.
They are men of the professional type, but animated
by the keen curiosity of the scientist. The desire for
planned progress, which we call evolution, must be
their dominant motive, for there is grave danger that
when an industry of this type passes from the promo-
tion to the marketing stage, initiative and alertness will
vanish with the promoter and the industry will fall
into stagnation under the dead hand of bureaucracy.
... In its earliest stage it was right that the profit
motive should be dominant, but now the professional
motive must take its place." To this, James Truslow
Adams (in Forum, Aug., 1931) adds that: "In every
department of our life, the responsibility of the tech-
nical expert is increasing in proportion to our growing
and necessary dependence upon him. One of the most
sinister influences now at work is the breaking down
in law, medicine, and other professions of the profes-
sional spirit as contrasted with the business spirit. This
is occurring just at the time when more than ever the
professional spirit has got to permeate all our activities
unless society itself is to break down."
If these ideas, which we try to build into our cur-
riculum and instruction in electrical engineering, find a
sympathetic response in you, we shall be glad to wel-
come you to our community.
While we are glad to exhibit to visitors and pros-
pective students the laboratories and physical equip-
ment of our Department of Electrical Engineering, we
wish to impress upon them at the same time our con-
viction that not ujKm these should a decision be made to
engage in this type of work at the University of Mich-
igan. Young men have often elected to enter upon the
study of electrical engineering merely because they
were fascinated by evidences of power and control
through this mysterious medium, or because they had
achieved some success as amateur experimenters in a
portion of the field such as radio; but unfortunately
some have lost their enthusiasm when they found that
rigorous and exacting studies of a more or less theo-
retical and abstract nature were necessary to prepare
them to compete for distinction or even for a living
in almost any phase of electrical engineering, with the
best young minds from all parts of the world in a uni-
versity as highly developed and distinguished as that
of the State of Michigan.
DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING
MECHANICS
Prof. E. L. Eriksen
The department of Engineering Mechanics was
created as a separate unit of the College of Engineering
in 1912. Before that time, mechanics was taught partly
by the department of Mathematics and partly by the
Civil Engineering department. Many engineers will
still recall the course in strength of materials generally
known as the S. and R. course.
A fundamental curriculum in Mechanics was adopt-
ed as a general requirement for all engineering stu-
dents, consisting of four courses: Statics, Dynamics.
Strength of Materials and Hydraulics.
W7hen the department was established, it also took
over the existing laboratory in Testing Materials and
an elective course in Testing Materials was offered in
addition to the required course.
No major changes were made for a number of
years. Professor Van den Broek developed an ad-
vanced course in the Theory of Elastic Energy. In
the summer of 1927, Professor S. Timoshenko was
appointed as Professor of Engineering Mechanics with
the definite view that he was to develop graduate study
in Engineering Mechanics.
Since then, the department has grown very rapidly
in this field of work and is now offering a series of
courses such as: Theory of Elasticity for Engineers.
Vibration Problems in Engineering, Theory of Thin
Plates, Stresses in Machine Parts, Plasticity, Stability
and others. Suffice it to say that the courses now of-
fered run from No. 1 to 26. All of the above men-

Baldwin Locomotive
Rivalry on the Rails
George Atherton, '36E
The electrifiation of railroads has long been consid-
ered. With the decline of natural resources and the in-
creasing cost of fuels, the electric railroads offer means
of a renaissance in the railroad industry. The present
steam locomotive, according to the railroad offiials,
stands for obsolete, inefficient accessory equipment and
as a last resort the railroads are now willing to try any
method to earn profits again.
The problem is not particularly one of an engineer-
ing nature but lies in the realm of economics, that vast
and nebulous subject of which, so says the economist,
the engineer is so ignorant and neglectful. The econ-
omist must untangle and eliminate the heavy capital
structure built up around our present railroad system,
must discount the poor judgment that led to such ex-
tremes as ninety-nine year term railroad securities, and
must find a substitute for the once strong belief in the
eternal permanence of the steam engine as a vital force
in transportation.
It is no secret that the railroads are today in bad
straits, even worse than could be explained as depres-
sion results. Perhaps the best illustration of this is
fastened to the wall directly before the writer of this
paper . It is a large, beautifully lithographed calendar
entitled "Railroad Calendar," and was issued by the
"Committee on Public Relations of the Eastern Rail-
roads." It is a gaudy and public lament by the railroads
of their own sad fate. All the days of the year are
blocked out in colors to represent the various outlets for
railroad earnings; some going as wages, some as loco-
motive fuel, materials and supplies and other operating
expenses, and some as interests and rents (fixed
charges). The unfortunate part of the story is that a
365 day year seems to be just 18 days too short, at
least for a favorable adjustment of revenue and ex-
penses, for the committee concludes with this dirge in
red type: "The railways did not earn their interest in
1933. In addition to interest paid from current trans-
portation earnings, it required the equivalent of 18
days of receipts to cover interest obligations."
In leaving the economic aspect, should we approach
the engineering problem bluntly, and consider the new
diesel-electric powered, lightweight, streamlined trains,
such as the Union Pacific and Burlington railroads
have operated recently? Since this paper concerns the
electrification of railroads, perhaps we had better side-
step this obvious issue (as many railroad executives

Joseph C. Wagner
Following a
Technic cus-
tom of recent
years, we have
the honor to
present our re-
tiring Managing
Editor, a man
whose achieve-
ments here on
the campus
would rate him
a write-up in any campus "Who's
Who." When not engaged in the
many campus activities with which
he is connected, Joseph C. Wagner,
"Joe" to his host of friends, is a
native of Detroit. Listing his many
activities and honors is almost a
task, hut we first find Joe with a
straight "A" average at the end of
the first semester. Phi Eta Sigma
claimed him first, and then, in rapid
succession, Triangles, Vulcans and
Tau Beta Pi. As a student working
his way through the University, Joe
won both a Gemmel and a Mandel-
baum scholarship.
We follow his rapid rise ill
the Reserve Officers Training
Corps, where he rose from a buck
private in the rear rank to the posi-
tion of Captain and Regimental
Adjutant. As a line captain he
headed the best drilled company in
the regiment. He also served on
the Military Ball committee as a
sophomore. Another military honor
was his election to Scabbard and
Blade.
Turning to new fields, Joe be-
came interested in the Technic and
went from tryont to Managing
Editor's Assistant, Articles Editor
and finally Managing Editor during
this last year. He has also served
on the Engineering Honor Com-
mittee and Engineering Council.
At present Joe is treasurer of
Phi Kappa fraternity, an active
A.S.M.E., and a member of the
Engineering Open House Exec-
utive committee. The Engineers'
Dance, our social highlight of the
year, was a great success under
Joe's chairmanship. His charming
partner on this occasion was Miss
Jeanne Andrews of Three Rivers,
who occupies Joe's dreams quite
regularly. He informs us that he
will return in the fall to tackle an-
other degree, this time in Engineer-
ing Mechanics. We have yet to find
a man on this campus who can
boast of such a truly great record.
It is with many regrets that we lose
Joe as an undergraduate. So long,
Joe, we'll follow your shining
career in the future.
Francis W. Dulyn
Among the notables in the senior
class is Francis W. "Frank" Dulyn.
Born in Pasadena, California,
Frank came east
to Detroit, where
he graduated
from Northern
High School.
Last year
Frank served on
the Finance com-
mittee of the
junior class. He
is also a member
of the Aero Branch, A.S.M.E.Along
military lines, Frank is president of
Pi Tau Pi Sigma, honorary Signal
Corps society. He was a major in
the R.O.T.C. the first semester and
was promoted to the office of cadet
Lieutenant Colonel this semester.
He was also Treasurer of the Mil-
itary Ball, one of the highlights of
the campus social season. In addi-
tion to all this, Frank is an active
member of Scabbard and Blade.
An active college career such as
this merits a host of good wishes
for the future.
Albert E. Marshall
When the Technic banquet was
held last month, marking the instal-
lation of a new staff into office, Al-
bert E. "Al" Marshall found him-
self out of another job in campus
activities. Al was the retiring edi-
tor and was so retired after a year
of excellent service in his position
as editor.
Al came to this country from
England in 1928 and graduated
from the Windsor Collegiate Insti-
tute in Canada. He has worked his
way through Michigan with the aid
of no less than four scholarships,
two of which he won in high school.
Since he has been here on campus
he has won a Gemmel and a Dono-
van scholarship, both for excellence
in academic work.
In October, 1932, Al became
assistant to the Alumni Notes Edi-
tor of the Technic, and advanced
to Professional Notes Editor the
following March. Beginning his
junior year, Al was elected class
secretary. He later became Editor
of the Technic and was elected to
Tau Beta Pi. Last fall found our
hero as secretary of the American
Institute of Electrical Engineers.
He holds an F.E.R.A. job and
works at the Sorosis house for his
meals. He is busy at present ar-
ranging the A.I.E.E. banquet, as he
is chairman of that committee.
Al was a member of the Slide
Rule dance committee and was
partly responsible for the effect of
revolving gears in the center dec-
oration above the orchestra. Little
Al had a "blind date" for the dance
and hasn't been quite the same
since. It seems
that there is
someone by the
name of Marital
who may be
found in the vi-
cinity of the hos-
pital.
It is with
many regrets
that we say fare-
well to Al.

WHERE'S OSCAR?
The Engineering Open House,
supposedly sponsored by the En-
gineering Council, is in reality
the outgrowth of a plan carried
out by three senior engineers,
John Schmidt, Joseph Wagner
and Tage Jacobson. These, with
the addition of another, comprise
the Engineering Open House
Executive Committee. The other
man is the President of the En-
gineering Council, to whom may
be directly placed the blame for
the inefficiency of organization
and lack of accomplishment which
the Council has accomplished
during the last year. The present
Council is a mere figurehead for
student government in the En-
gineering College. When the
position of president of the Coun-
cil is filled by a responsible stu-
dent, it will then be possible for
the Council to represent the stu-
dents as it should.
The president of the Council
has shouldered none of the re-
sponsibilities of his office, as is
shown by his continued absence
from their meetings. He was to
have procured a speaker for the
Engineering Smoker but failed
to do so, and as a result, the
Smoker had to be called off by
the other members of the Council
in their last meeting. There are
men on the Council at the pres-
ent time who have the spirit and
willingness to make the organ-
ization what it is meant to be.
Give these men a capable leader
and we predict the accomplish-
ment of definite objectives in the
near future.
The Technic is the official pub-
lication of the College and in that
capacity it has maintained a
"Hands off" policy in student
politics. It is now apparent that
someone should acquaint the stu-
dent body with the present de-
plorable condition. We present
below a few of the reasons why
the Council can give us a real co-
ordinated form of student gov-
ernment.
1. The Faculty of the College
is squarely behind the Council
and has indicated this repeatedly
by electing a faculty man as their
representative on the Council.
2. The proper coordination of
the various student activities can
For the engineer who is interested in
broadening his field of non-technical
reading we have yet to come across a
better list of suggestions than that re-
cently compiled by Will Durant, well
known author and philosopher. At the
end of his list Mr. Durant adds this com-
mentary: "Give me just one hour a day
and in four years I will make you a schol-
ar and a philosopher. But let us under-
stand each other: You must not expect
any material gain from this intimacy with
great men. Some lucre may flow inci-
dentally in later years from the maturity
and background that you will win; but
these dividends, like those of the insur-
ance company, are not in any way guar-
anteed; you take your chance. . . This,
then is our Odyssey of books. When life
is bitter, or friendship slips away, we
shall come and sit at the table with
Shakespeare and Goethe, laugh at the
world with Rabelais, and see its loveliness
with John Keats. These are friends who
give only their best." Number of volumes
in the list: 151. Time required for read-
ing: 4 years at 7 hours per week. 10
hours per volume.
Copies of this list, which we endorse
as exceptionally good, may be secured by
cutting out this article and dropping it,
with a self-addressed, stamped envelope,
in the mailbox of the MICHIGAN TECH-
NIC. 3036 E. Eng. Bldg. Additional copies
are available for 6c in stamps.
be effected by an active En-
gineering Council under proper
leadership.
3. The various student organ-
izations have shown their sup-
port of this organization by elect-
ing their most active members to
the Engineering Council.
4. The four classes have also
expressed their desire for proper
government by electing repre-
sentatives to the Council each
year.
5. The MICHIGAN TECH-
NIC has continually shown its
support by offering unlimited
publicity to the Council.
6. The general membership of
the Council is earnestly interest-
ed in its continuance as shown by
the activity of Tage Jacobson
and Joseph Wagner, members of
the Council, who have helped
formulate and direct the En-
gineering Open House.
7. The Engineering societies
have pointed the way to unity by
their cooperation with the Open
House committee.
8. The student body has shown
its support by attendance at the
various events sponsored by the
Council in former years.
9. Professor Walter Sadler and
Walter Powers, '34E, paved the
way for proper coordination by
revising the constitution of the
Council to make it a useful and
practical body, instead of a myth-
ical organization of figureheads.
10. The Engineering Council
has full power and the approval
of Dean Sadler to run student af-
fairs in the Engineering College.
Through our editorial pages
we have consistently attempted
to prod the Council president to
action by praise, criticism and
suggestive reasoning, but to no
avail. We urge all student soci-
eties in the College to send to the
Council a responsible representa-
tive who will properly express
the views of the organization
which he represents. See that
YOUR representative supports
the man most capable of leading
the Engineering Council out of
its present sorry state. THE
NEW PRESIDENT WILL BE
ELECTED ON MAY 21st!!!!
The art of living is founded on
engineering. Every man in his own
small, everyday world is an engi-
neer. Let an inscription on the walls
of the Engineering Societies' Li-
brary in New York City tell you
why: engineering is "The art of

STRESSES
The column is dedicated this month to Philip R.
Ewald, who conducted this section in an admirable
manner for the school year so near ended. It is with
a great deal of pleasure that yours truly presents a
clever bit of true genius; Humor written by Mr. Ewald
entitled:
THE BIG BATTLE
Things had come to a pretty pass (no one had a
biddable suit) in the year 1945. The Engineers had
for a long time maintained that the Lits were a bunch
of spineless, dissipated morons; and the Lits had de-
clared that the Engineers were
a gang of soul-less, mentally
abberated boors. Honor was
at stake; war was declared.
Breastworks were imme-
diately thrown up hither and
thither. The Lits outnumbered
the Engineers four to one, so
the strength of the opposing
forces was about equal. It was
an imposing sight on that
bright Ann Arbor morning
with the rain coming down in
sheets, and not very clean
sheets at that. The editor of
the Gargoyle could be seen
patrolling the Lit lines mount-
ed on a St. Bernard and wear-
ing a checked tweed jacket
with a half belt and yoke
across the shoulders. The
trousers were of pleated brown
flannel and cut full, with rabbit's wool socks and a
l»rk pie hat as accessories. The editor of the Technic
could be seen charging up and down behind the engine
lines on a Great Dane, brandishing a slide rule and
shouting: "We want beer east of Division!"
Precisely at the zero hour the Lit's crack regiment,
the Light Hound Cavalry, consisting entirely of BM
OC's mounted on prominent campus hounds, charged
down the diagonal. The Engineers, in desperation,
rounded up a corps of architects and had them paint
murals of vast, treeless plains, which were placed in
front of the Engineers' lines. The cliarging dogs, upon
seeing the murals, saw no use in further advance and
immediately retreated for the certainty of the wooded

campus.
It was then that D. C. Ammeter had a brilliant
idea. He rounded up a supply of five-gallon water
jugs—had them evacuated, corked, taken to East En-
gineering Building, and there uncorked in the halls—
than recorked, taken to the lines, placed in trench
mortars, and fired into the Lit lines. The effect of
East Engine atmosphere might be anticipated. The
carnage was terrible, it always is in these things.
As a last resort, the Lits began an offensive from
all sides. The Lngineers were being crushed by sheer
weight of numbers. The cause appeared lost. As a
last resort, the generalissimo
issued orders to dig in on all
fronts, except East Hall, and
to retreat from that area. The
Lits, elated at meeting no re-
sistance on this front, charged
through and occupied East
Hall. Immediately the Engin-
eers launched a vigorous coun-
ter attack on all other fronts.
By this strategy the Lits were
all forced into East Hall,
wliere they were held by the
Engineers. A cap pistol was
fired, the terrific concussion
was too much for the worm-
eaten timbers of East Hall
and the building came tum-
bling down with a tremendous
crash, ending the battle, which
at once became history.
One of them thar city slickers was extolling the virtues
of the simple life. During his somewhat lengthy gab-fest
the effect of coffee upon sleep was dealt with sharply and
firmly. An old mountaineer took this occasion to differ,
and the city feller took up the argument with an aggres-
sive question.
"Did you," he queried sharply, "ever drink much
coffee?"
"Wal," calculated the old codger, "I'd reckon nigh
onter thirty er forty mugs a day, seems as how."
"What," gasped his disgruntled opponent, "doesn't it
keep you awake?"
"Wal," mused the old boy, "it helps."

With many regrets the
Technic suspends publication
for the summer at the end of
its fifty-third successive year.
As the official publication of
the College of Engineering.
the Technic and its staff has
attempted to present to you
through its pages some idea
of the events and accomplish-
ments of the college during the past year. We hope
that you have enjoyed reading it enough to return in
October and keep up with YOUR ALMA MATER through
the pages of the Technic. If your subscription expires
with this issue you may receive the next eight issues by
sending one dollar and fifty cents in check or cash to
Don P. Reynolds, Sales and Publicity Manager, % The
Technic.
As you read this, the Engineering Open House will
be in full swing and a lot of old grads, and young
grads too, will be enjoying the company of their old
classmates and all the other pleasantries that make
class reunions and spring homecoming a big success.
If you have read your April Technic you will notice
that the new staff for the coming year, 1935-36, is now
heavily burdened with the responsibilities of publica-
tion. We hope to give you a real magazine for the
coming year, one that you will enjoy reading and
saving.
Before signing off for this year, we might announce
an added feature of YOUR alumni section. Beginning
with the October issue, one prominent alumnus will be
featured each month on a full page with a photograph
and short biography. You old alumni will remember
that this was done several years back when such out-
standing men as Robert P. Lamont, '91, Secretary of
Commerce under Herbert Hoover; Ormoncl E. Hunt,
'07, of General Motors, and William L. Clements, '82,
a University Regent for twenty-five years, were pre-
sented in the pages of the Technic as written examples
01 real achievement. We believe that this type of ma-
terial is not only interesting reading for the alumni but
also for the students. We can never hear too many
stories about Michigan graduates. With these remarks
we bid you adios until October, when the Technic will
return better than ever.
The Director of Sales for the Ozark Smelting Co.,
a branch of Sherwin-Williams Co., is James E. Todd,
'16, M.S. '17. Mr. Todd has recently been transferred
from Cleveland to Chicago and holds the same posi-
tion there. The alumni seem to have a desire to get to
the "Windy City" as James Humi, Ph.D. '30, and H.
S. Sherman, M.S. '32, both connected with Sherwin-

College Review
A.S.M.E. MECHANICALS ELECT NEW OFFICERS
At the last meeting in April, the
Mechanical branch of the A.S.M.E.
elected the officers for the coining
year. David Witheridge, "36, was
chosen president. The other ofliccrs
are: Vice-president, John Framer,
'36; secretary, Robert Young, "38;
treasurer, Clarence Green, "37, and Engineering Coun-
cil representative, Lawrence Lentz, '35.
Professor Boston spoke on the importance of be-
coming student members of the A.S.M.E. at the pres-
ent time, as it is planned to induct student members
from accredited schools into full membership when
they reach thirty years of age. Under this arrangement
there will be no examinations for the certificate of
membership, although requirements for student mem-
bership will be made more stringent.
Professor C. B. Gordy spoke on the effect of the
N.R.A. on the wage systems in the automotive industry.
The greatest change, he said, has been the shift
from the incentive system to the straight hourly
pay scale. By using this method, the leaders of the
industry hoped to satisfy the men who were dis-
satisfied with the former system, whereby they
were paid a flat rate plus a bonus which varied ac-
cording to their efficiency in output. However, the
shift has actually changed the total wages very
little. The new system has its defects and cannot
be considered as a permanent solution to the wage
problem.
On May 13, the club made an inspection trip to
the Packard plant with the Aeros, and the entire
A.S.M.E. enrollment were the guests of the Detroit
branch of the organization at the annual dinner
held at the Detroit Yacht Club.
A.I.E.E. BANQUET
The electrical s made another attempt
to eclipse the mechanicals' annual ban-
quet by having, what they aptly termed,
"A ROST" of their own. All the meter
readers rallied round for a dinner and a
general get-together at the Union on May 2.
Mr. Swartz of the Detroit Edison Co. talked on
"Engineering Extras." He emphasized the value of
the engineering student supplementing his technical
education with courses of a distinctly cultural aspect.
After outlining the organization of the Detroit Edison
Co., showing how engineering graduates are distrib-
uted through the entire staff, he pointed out that many
of the positions demand more than mere technical
knowledge.
CIVILS HEAR ABOUT POWER FOR PHILADELPHIA
At a recent meeting, the A.S.C.E. pre-
sented an illustrated lecture describing
the newly constructed Conowingo Dam
and power plant. This new project is
located on the Susquehanna River about
twenty miles from Chesapeake Bay. The
purpose of this plant is to supply electricity to the city
of Philadelphia, and it was largely through the finan-
cial aid of the "Quaker City" that this project was
completed.
The site chosen was a valuable one since the river at
this point drains approximately 27,000 square miles of
land, thus assuring an ample supply of water the year
round. The lake formed by the clam extends fourteen
miles upstream and has a surface area of 8600 acres.
The structure is 4700 feet long with a power house
at one end capable of supplying 387,000 horsepower
with an effective water head of eighty-five feet.
The height of the dam is only 105 feet, and it is
built much on the order of the Wilson Dam at Muscle
Shoals. Twenty-eight hundred men were employed in
building the dam, and the work was completed six
months ahead of schedule.
TAU BETES TO HAVE WEEK-END PARTY
On May 25 and 26, the actives of Tau
Beta Pi are to have a weekend party at the
Lakelands Hotel, about thirty miles from
Ann Arbor. Twenty couples are expected
to attend, and Professor and Mrs. Walter
Sadler and Professor and Mrs. Axel Marin
have been asked to chaperon. This is the only campus
organization to be granted the privilege of holding this
type of party.
The annual Spring Formal dance of Tau Beta Pi
was held on Friday, May 3, in the Ethel Fountain
Hussey room of the League.
At a meeting on April 30th in the Union, the mem-
bers were addressed by a Fellowship winner from
Missouri, who spoke on the direct benefits which he
had derived from the fellowship. This fellowship, of
which there are six awarded each year, entitles the hold-
er to free tuition and $650 for' one year for doing grad-
uate work in the university of his own choice.
HONORS TO OUR GENERALS
Sporting snappy denim coats and trousers, set off
by regulation cartridge belts stuffed with cigarettes,
sixteen embryo generals showed their superior soldier-
ing for the benefit of the Scabbard and Ulade actives.
After a week of rigid training they entered the ranks
of Scabbard and Blade fresh from a short night march
from Dexter, with full equipment. Formal initiation
ceremonies were held on the campus at the flagpole,
and the banquet later in the evening, at the Union
with 150 guests in attendance.

organizing and directing men, and
controlling the forces and materials
of nature for the benefit of the
human race."
Walter Pitkin, in his recent
book, "New Careers for Youth," an
unusually sound discussion of the
post-1929 job outlook for men and
women, states that "No training
today is more valuable than that of
engineering. It is vital in many
promising lines of work if for no
other reason than its rigorous intel-
lectual discipline ... I have never
yet met an engineer who, when
presented with a problem of inter-
est or importance to him, did not
attack it in orderly, precise fash-
ion."
Educators throughout the coun-
try are rapidly realizing the im-
portance of the development of the
scientific habit of mind. This new
world in which we must live today
is a highly organized and industrial-
ized one. It will not accept slip-
shod, rule-of-thumb ways of doing
things. It demands a definite and
direct plan of attack in the con-
sideration of problems and situa-
tions. Method is the keynote of
the new society. Engineering edu-
cation has progressed perhaps
further in the development of the
scientific habit of mind than any
other of the educational fields be-
cause such a presentation of the
subject is practically essential. There
can be no other, if anything at all in
the name of progress is to be ac-
complished. In the engineering cur-
ricula are found a number of
courses commonly known as prob-
lem courses. Here an attempt is
made to teach the student the art
of problem solving, not the game
of formula plugging, and there is
indeed a vast difference between
the two. The introduction of open
book exams in an increasing num-
ber of courses is a stride toward
the goal. But assuming that the
engineer does learn a little of the
art of problem solving, he too often
fails to realize the full usefulness
of his tool. He is sometimes in-
clined to forget that the value of
engineering principles is not limited
to the generation of power and the
construction of trusses. I recently
had occasion to talk with an indus-
trial plant superintendent who had
several years of experience in hiring
college engineers. His chief criti-
cism of the men he had received
was their lack of the practical mind.
They were good technical theorists
but they hadn't yet realized that
engineering consists of moulding
men and economies as well as steel.
They had not learned to apply engi-
neering principles outside of a
purely technical field.
All solutions to problems,
whether of an engineering, social,
or purely personal nature are char-
acterized by certain basic funda-
mentals which might be summed up
under the all-inclusive heading of
organized thought. The man who
can proceed along an orderly, direct
line of thought is the man who
comes through on a blue-book, who
can solve the problems he hasn't
been shown how to do, and is a
personal as well as a professional
success. This is the aim of an engi-
neering education.

Oxy-acetylene welding and cutting add a new note of
grace and efficiency in modern piping systems.
By G. O. Carter*
Nowadays everything is being
"streamlined'" — airplanes, auto-
mobiles, trains, ships, approach
their greatest degree of grace and
efficiency through this design prin-
ciple. Usually their streamlining
is all on the outside. Piping joined
by welding is streamlined both
inside and outside.
WELDED ASSEMBLIES such
as this loop in a steam line are
easily made.
100,000 Miles Installed
Welded joints were first used
for river crossings in oil pipe lines.
They proved strong ana sturdy
enough to withstand the shocks of
this difficult service. Soon welding
came into general use for every joint
in the line. Today over 100,000
miles of welded pipe carry oil,
gas and gasoline over the country.
The economies which welding
brought to the construction and
maintenance of pipe lines led to
its adoption for power plant and
industrial piping. Now it is the
first choice of many engineers for
all kinds of piping.
Prevents Leakage Loss
Streamlined welded piping has
many attractive features besides
itssmooth lines. Welding is sound,
safe, and in the final analysis, the
most economical way of putting
pipe together.
Welding makes a "jointless"
job—insures the owner from fu-
ture maintenance. Permanence is
so positive that in the Cathedral
of St. John the Divine in New
York, welded piping has been in-
stalled in masonry walls fourteen
feet thick. In other instances coils
of welded piping have been set
directly in plaster in the ceilings
and walls of beautiful residences.
Modern skyscrapers enclose mile
upon mile of welded piping. In
one building group in the East
there are over 85 miles of welded
steam piping alone.
Avoids Friction
Pipe joined by welding is smooth
inside and outside—truly stream-
lined. The smooth outside makes
insulation less costly and easier to
apply. The smooth inside makes
friction negligible and reduces
power losses. Welded piping is
now used for gases and liquids of
all sorts and for many solids—
requiring pipe of every size and
of almost every metal.
Permanent but Flexible
To be a sound investment today,
buildings must remain relatively
free from maintenance. Piping
SINUOUS CURVES of welded
pipe sweep from Hour lo floor carry-
ing steam, water, gases and liquids.
must be permanent, strong, leak-
proof and reasonable in cost.
Welded piping is permanent.
But alterations can be made easily
when desired. The oxy-acetylene
cutting blowpipe gives the ready
means of making an opening. The
addition is then tied-in simply by
means of welding. This is espe-
cially important in the moderni-
zation of old buildings.

SLIPSTICKS VERSUS LIPSTICKS
The long-fought engineer-liter-
ary student controversy has at
last been crystallized. Recogniz-
ing that the literary student is in
no way fitted to compete with the
engineer in he realm of integrals
and bending moments, the
doughty scientist has girded his loins and advanced
into the very heart of the enemy camp. Here, on
the foreign ground of forensic competition, our en-
gineers are preparing to bomb the oily waters of
persuasion with the hard cold shells of fact!
Recognizing further, that their fellow students
are not entirely to blame for their present deplor-
aLle state of ignominy, it was unanimously felt that
t::at factor contributing more than any other should
be chosen as he topic tor the discussion, which, for-
mally worded, is: Resolved, That the Literary Col-
lege is Suffering from Co-education.
Here on the traditional stump, the engineers, rep-
resented by Sigma Rho Tau, will engage in mortal
combat with the Adelphi, representing the Literary
students. Here in the open, on a balmy May after-
noon, the great tragedy of the literary college will
be distilled through the medium of forensic inter-
course.
In order that we do not selfishly contain the
benefits of this epochal conflict within the w^alls of
our own institution, it has been decided to consol-
idate this debate with the Engineering Open House
Program, thus granting other worthy seekers of
knowledge the privilege of attending this highest
form of mental entertainment. So gather—Ye En-
gineers—to give support to the worthy sons of Sig-
ma Rho Tau in their effort to raise aloft the victory
banners of this, our Alma Mater!!!!!

tioned courses have been developed by Professor Tim-
oshenko.
Students can now study for a bachelor's degree in
Engineering Mechanics. Naturally only a few do this,
but it is felt that there is a definite field for engineers
who have a natural ability for advanced Mathematics
and wish to apply it to Engineering problems.
At the present time there are two distinct divisions
in Mechanics; the undergraduate work, which may be
classed as a service department for the other technical
departments, and the graduate or advanced division.
The graduate division is a unit by itself, and offers the
advanced courses required for the bachelor's degree in
Mechanics and also advanced work for students in the
Graduate School who wish to study for the Master's
and Doctor's degree in Engineering Mechanics. A def-
inite curriculum for these degrees has been established.
Advanced courses have also been offered during the
Summer Sessions and it has been our good fortune to
attract a number of Mechanics teachers from other
universities and colleges as well as graduate students.
The graduate courses have necessitated more lab-
oratory work and extension of laboratory space. Be-
sides the original space in Rooms 101 and 102 in West
Engineering Bldg., the second floor of the West Engi-
neering Annex (old shops) is now devoted to labora-
tory and study rooms for graduate students under
Professor Timoshenko. The concrete laboratory has
been moved over on the ground floor of the old shops
and lately we have acquired an extra room to take care
of the required undergraduate laboratory work in con-
nection with the course in strength of materials. There
are also regular equipped laboratories for Photo-Elas-
ticity, Dynamics, Creep of Metals and other units used
by graduate students and faculty for research work.
Some new equipment has been added such as a
torsion fatigue machine and an Amsler machine. Most
of the equipment has been developed and designed
right on the Campus. The old 200,000 Ib. tension ma-
chine has been remodelled so that nine-foot specimens
may now be tested in tension or compression.
In its development, the Engineering Mechanics de-
partment has had the fullest cooperation of all the
other units in the College of Engineering, including
the department of Mathematics, now offering several
courses adapted for graduate students in Mechanics.
The departments of Civil Engineering, Mechanical
Engineering and Aeronautical Engineering recommend
many of their graduate students to take some courses
in advanced Mechanics. Dean Sadler has supported us
in every way possible and one cannot but feel that
there is a cooperative spirit among the entire group
in the Engineering College that is very encouraging
for future work and development.
DEPARTMENT OF GEODESY AND
SURVEYING
Prof. Harry Bouchard
Surveying has been taught at the University of
Michigan since 1857. Much of the early surveying in
this country was performed by civil engineers, bound-
aries of lands, railroads, canals, etc., having been lo-
cated by them. The mapping of much of our coasts
and many of our harbors, as aids to navigation, was
also done by civil engineers. As nautical charts often
cover very large areas, the size and shape of the earth
must be taken into consideration in preparing these
charts, and a much higher degree of precision is re-
quired than is necessary in the case of construction
surveys. Where the construction engineer is dealing
with angles measured to minutes, the data of a precise
survey involve hundredths of seconds.
As the size and speed of steamships have increased,
more accurate charts, extending farther and farther
from shore, have been required. The older methods
which were satisfactory when the area mapped was
within sight of land and the water shallow can no
longer be used. The ships of the U. S. Coast and
Geodetic Survey now bristle with complicated instru-
ments, radio equipment, sound apparatus, oscillographs,
and other such apparatus seldom seen outside a labora-
tory of physics. By means of this modern equipment
ocean depths can be determined almost instantaneously
and the positions of ships many miles from shore can
be accurately found. Such work involves a study of
the transmission of sound through sea water of vary-
ing depths, temperatures, and salinity, and a knowl-
edge of radio transmitting and receiving equipment,
operating on the frequencies best suited to the par-
ticular problem.
Precise surveys on land are required to provide an
accurate ground work for topographic surveys carried
on by federal, state, and municipal organizations, and
by local surveyors and engineers. Precise surveys are
likewise required on large scale engineering projects.
Before a long bridge, such as the one at San Francisco,
or a long tunnel, can be designed, or built, extremely
accurate surveys, carried out with geodetic methods
and equipment, must be made to determine the length
and the alignment of the structure.
Triangulation systems have been completed in many
progressive cities to provide an accurate framework
for topographic, property, and underground maps. As
the coordinates of many points, such as street inter-
sections and the corners of public property, are accu-
rately determined, they serve as starting points for
surveys of the local engineers and surveyors, and per-
mit the descriptions of real property boundaries to be
given by reference to the coordinates of the corners of
each parcel of land. When any monument is accident-
ally destroyed it is easily replaced from its known re-
lations to nearby existing monuments.
Precise surveys must be executed by specially

considerably different from those used on less accurate
work. It was for the purpose of training men for this
field that the Department of Geodesy and Surveying
was organized at the University of Michigan in 1921.
In addition to the teaching of plane surveying to stu-
dents of engineering, architecture, forestry, and land-
scape design, courses are presented which deal with the
methods and the equipment that are used when the
actual shape of the earth is taken into consideration.
After completing courses on the campus which
cover the theory and field methods of plane surveying,
students of civil engineering and of geodesy and sur-
veying spend one or more summers at Camp Davis
in northwestern Wyoming. Here, for eight weeks, the
student lives the life of a surveyor, in its most favor-
able aspects, and attains a skill and confidence in him-
self which could not be gained in any other way. He
makes a 1700-mile trip across the country, lives under
the most healthful conditions, visits Yellowstone Park
and other points of scenic interest, inspects large scale
engineering projects, and gains a knowledge of his
country which might otherwise not come to him for
many years.
Graduates of the department have, for the most
part, become associated with the U. S. Coast and Geo-
detic Survey, usually beginning as observers on pre-
cise surveys, and where capable, soon rising to more
important and more responsible positions.

probably wish they could) and argue on more even
terms of the comparative values of steam and the di-
rect electric drive locomotive.
Railroad electrification dates historically from 1895.
In that year the Baltimore and Ohio railroad equipped
their belt line in the city of Baltimore for electric
operation. Since then this development has been a sort
of outline of one of the most important details of rail-
road electrification—that of tunnels and terminals.
Eleven electric locomotives have been purchased for
this development and eight of them are still in use,
three having been retired after 25 years of service.
Compare this to the average life of a steam locomotive.
Aside from the aesthetic improvement of terminals
and saving in expense to shippers due to strategic loca-
tion of electrified terminals in the heart of cities, we
find that electrification lowers standby losses inherent
in a steam power plant, increases the flexibility of con-
trol, eliminates dead fuel loads, reduces congestion in
mounting grade divisions by increased speed under
severe conditions, lessens the effect of rigorous winters
on locomotive movements, in short, overcomes most of
the recognized limitations of the steam locomotive.
Must we have figures to prove these seemingly ob-
vious facts? Assuming that a well written paper de-
mands such, let us investigate. The Chicago, Milwau-
kee &amp; St. Paul Railway completed, in 1916, electrifica-
tion of some 648 miles of main line in the mountain
division. In 1924 a comprehensive and impartial study
was made of the comparative cost of steam and electric

of steam operation for mountainous districts was that
the net additional investment of $15.625.000 entailed
in the complete eletrification of the 648 miles of track
had enabled a saving over steam operation for the
period studied of $12.400,000, this over and above the
interest and carrying charges. Or. in the words of the
report, "the reduction in the cost of operation has been
sufficient to liquidate more than three-quarters of the
initial outlay, in addition to paying all interest and
depreciation charges."
Electrification has solved many a problem in high
operating costs in the mountainous countries of Mexico.
Spain, and South America. One notable example is on
the Spanish Northern Railway. Here thirty-eight and
one half miles of track in a most tortuous section of
the mountains was changed from steam to electric
operation in 1924. In this electrified length the road
goes through 71 tunnels, most of which are on curves,
and whose aggregate length comprises seventeen of the
thirty-eight and one-half miles.
The report of the engineering committee of the rail-
road shows substantial savings over a period of one
year's operation, both in reduction of capital equipment
and operating costs. It was found that 12 electric loco-
motives could satisfactorily replace the 30 steam en-
gines and tenders which had formerly been necessary,
that there was a saving of 55% in the power required
for operation, of 74%. in the cost of locomotive repair
and upkeep, of 63% in crew expense, and of 31 c/( in
the cost of moving a ton-mile.
The above figures are admittedly in that large class
termed, sometimes disparagingly, "statistics," and more
or less weight may be placed on them, according to the
belief and temperament of the reader. Consequently,
to the doubter, I would recommend a practial 'compar-
ison of steam and electric motive power something on
this order: Secure a ticket from Xew York to, say.
Tuxedo Park, via the steam powered branch of the
Erie Railroad, choose a warm, perspiration-drawing
afternoon in the summer and take the ride. Later, when
the opportunity offers, secure a ticket from Xew York

SYNTHETIC SUNLIGHT
THE people whose apartments faced the lower
levels of the ventilating shafts in a 14-story New
York apartment house had long ago given up the
hope that direct sunlight would enter their windows.
Imagine their astonishment one morning not long
ago to find light—lots of it—streaming in. When
they looked, they found not the sun, but 18 of the
sun's able little imitators—General Electric flood-
lights. They had been mounted on the ninth-floor
level.
Theengineers were thoughtful of the tenants' feelings.
For when the switch is thrown no sudden glare of
light paralyzes unaccustomed householders in the
act of brushing their teeth or doing setting up exer-
cises, pastimes which were formerly cloaked in inti-
mate gloom. A fully automatic synchronous-motor
time switch actuates a dimmer, and the floodlights
do not attain full brilliancy for 15 minutes.
GROANING RAILS
AFEW weeks ago, the rails between Schenectady
and Benning, D. C., groaned under what is
believed to be the heaviest load ever transported on
a single car. The load consisted of the generator
shaft, rotor, and poles for a General Electric frequen-
cy-converter set being installed at the plant of the
Potomac Electric Light and Power Company to
deliver 25-cycle, single-phase power to the Pennsyl-
vania Railroad.
Because of weight and clearance requirements,
however, the route of the shipment was round about.
A check of practically every foot of the way was made
to determine if temporary obstructions could be re-
moved to allow the load to pass. From Schenectady
to Wilkes-Barre, Pa., the car traveled on the Dela-
ware &amp; Hudson. From Wilkes-Barre, the car was
sent to Hagerstown, Md., on the Pennsylvania Rail-
road, where it was turned over to the Western
Maryland Railroad. After an extensive detour, it
was delivered back to the Pennsylvania on its main
line just south of the Baltimore tunnels, which were
the principal reasons for the complicated routing.
From there it was carried directly to the power com-
pany's siding in the District of Columbia.
The equipment weighed 367,000 pounds. The special
car added another 104,300 pounds, making the total
weight on the rails 471,300 pounds.
FISH LIFE SAVER
THE people in the New York Aquarium were
very unhappy. Many of their rare fish were dy-
ing of a mysterious malady. An investigation
showed that the water pumped into, the tanks con-
tained contaminating metal salts, and that these
salts came from the metal pumps in the system.
They appealed to the H. A. Smith Pump &amp; Motor
Company for help. Mr. Smith began testing all the
nonmetallic substances available for making pumps.
He tried 14 materials and found that General Elec-
tric Textolite was the only one that would prevent
this pollution of the water and at the same time make
a satisfactory pump.
Engineers of the General Electric Plastics Depart-
ment were called in, and a new pump was designed,
using five different grades of Textolite. The pump
was so constructed that no water can come into con-
tact with metal.

• The construction of an East Texas gasoline plant required
approximately 80 miles of welded pipe. The piping system included
gathering lines from over 1000 wells. It involved straight line runs,
headers, bull-plugs, bends, angles and other specials. Pipe size
ranged from 3-in. to 26-in. diameter—5/32-in. to 7/16-in. wall.
The Lindeweld method of oxy-acetylene welding was selected
for this project after competitive tests with other types of pipe
joints. The company found Lindewelding produced dependably-
uniform results, cost less, and could be done in less time.
The entire system was tested under pressure. Many of the weld-
ing operators had not used Lindewelding previously. Yet the com-
pany's engineers reported they did not find a single defective weld.
Lindewelding was brought to this project as a part of Linde
Process Service, which is regularly available to Linde Customers—
without charge. Linde Offices will gladly give you complete details

* Lindewelding is a new method of oxy-acetylene welding devel-
oped by the Linde engineering and research organizations. This
method requires less oxygen, less acetylene and less welding rod.
Welds can be completed in less time. Yet Lindewelding involves
only a special flame adjustment and a "back-hand" technique, to-
gether with Oxweld No. 24 Lindeweld Process Welding Rod.
When circumstances permit, the Multi-Flame Lindeweld Head can
be used. This will further increase the speed of Lindewelding.
It costs only $7.75. On pipe line construction Lindewelding is
consistently saving 1 5 to 40 per cent in welding time, rods and gases.

When Bertrand Russell appears on
the campus it is rather amusing to see
how many groups seek to claim him as
their own. I recall that he has been in-
troduced as a physicist, an economist, a
philosopher, and a sociologist. To these
rather formidable titles may be added
that of mathematician, for mathematics,
sometimes called the mother of the sci-
ences, is his chief claim to fame. Now
it seems rather strange that the people
in the various fields mentioned, while
willing to accept Russell as a patron
saint, are still quite unwilling to allow so
wide a latitude to their own colleagues,
and certainly no such range of interest
to their students. While feeling some
hesitancy about following the author
into all his ramifications of thought, I
still think of him as an ideal intellectual,
like whom I could wish to be. When I
see his slight but well-poised figure be-
fore an audience, I wish there were
more people in the world with his intre-
pid spirit and his wide range of interest.
What stands in the way of an acqui-
sition somewhat comparable to his? In
the first place there is custom; in the
second place, inertia and downright lack
of ability; and in the third place, the
formation of utterly wrong habits. The
hedges of custom are planted and nour-
ished by the stout defenders of the
faith, both scientific and religious. I have
no reference here to the revolutionary
political doctrines of Russell; but I do
refer specifically to the fact that a large
number of scientists, or quasi-scientists,
guard very jealously their own tradi-
tional fields and loudly acclaim that
all are novices who have not highly
specialized knowledge in the field in
question. They also close all doors to
outsiders and insist that the so-called
novices must remain in ignorance. I re-
member that only last year a certain
specialist was highly amused because I
showed an interest in a recent book that
contained knowledge of a rather tech-
nical nature. Everybody is permitted
the pleasures to be had from reading
poetry and from contemplating art gen-
erally, although few can contribute
either to the technique or the theory of
art. All men are permitted the pleasures
of worship although few are trained in

religious lore or in theology. The pur-
suit of scientific ideas, like the study of
poetry, may give information and solace
to those who have no religious bent;
hence scientific knowledge in general
should be the possession of all who lay
claim to culture.
I shall pass over a consideration of
those whose abilities are too limited to
permit of their delving into the litera-
ture of science, for their handicap is
impossible to overcome. I do, however,
want to say a word about the rigidity
of the curricula of our colleges and uni-
versities. The late President Burton
somewhere speaks of the "false depart-
mentalization of the field of knowledge.1'
The idea is akin to the one before men-
tioned, but it also has another sugges-
tion. Too many of our educators assume
the exclusive validity of their own fields
and so attempt to keep their students
within limited realms of technology and
theory. Their contention is that students,
once grounded in the theory and prac-
tice of a narrow field, can through read-
ing acquire an extended acquaintance
in a number of realms of science even
after graduation. They fail to
realize, however, that the stu-
dent is a creature of habit, and
that his traits are definitely set
before he leaves college. By the
time his fourth year is finished,
the damage has been done, and
the acquiring of habits of gen-
eral reading is as impossible as
the acquiring of new racial
traits. What is needed is an
extension of the student's men-
tal horizon so that while he
may not be a better tool for
some one else's gain he will at
any rate be able to live more
fully and to contemplate more
of the important facts and prin-
ciples of living. Professor Wen-
ley used to speak of "that anae-
mic bogey preparation for life."
Of course, he did not mean that
people should not be prepared
for life, but rather that they
should not be narrowly pre-
pared—trained merely as bread-
winners, as bridge builders, or
as mere doers in any field.
There is in every man's life an amount
of leisure time which must be spent as
advantageously as possible. Some of
this may be given to club life and to
other forms of institutionalized pur-
suits, but the wise man will lay out
for himself a certain amount of intel-
lectual activity which will lead to the
contemplation of worth while, though
highly impractical knowledge. I am
speaking now of the formation of right
habits.
There is a vast, alluring field in the
history of the exact sciences and in the
literature of the normative sciences.
Anthropology, sociology, economics, and
ethnology are some of the sciences,
fascinating in the extreme, about which
much that is significant and readable
has been written. The technical man
must constantly remind himself that
these and other subjects are worthy of
his attention and that he cannot allow
himself to be scared from the storehouse
of ideas contained in the better books.
He may never become a specialist in
any one of the pursuits mentioned, but

At last, that annoying
clickety-clack of the speed-
ing train is being eliminated.
Millions of passengers have
been kept awake, time and
again, by that syncopated,
jolting impact caused by th?
expansion joint in the old-
fashioned rail. The railroads
have always been subjected
to competition, but this present depres-
sion has brought this salient fact to
the mind of the railroad executive: to
compete with the boat, airplane and
bus, he must have speed and comfort
as well as low price, and naturally, there
must be a change in rail transportation
to bring these about. As far back as
1905, the locomotive was capable of at-
taining speeds in excess of 100 m.p.h.
Admittedly, stream-lining is capable of
raising this rate slightly, but, for the
most part, it was not wind resistance
that made trains literally crawl when
they had almost enough power to fly. The
essential factor in determining the speed
of our railroad trains is track condition.
That one-eighth inch of space in every
thirty odd feet of rail affects riding con-
ditions such that high speeds are unat-
tainable in regular schedule, and com-
fort is impossible.
Research by railway engineers led to
the conclusion that their three objec-
tives could be achieved by use of a bet-
minutes after the molten metal flows from the crucible to the base of the rail the large clamps
will force the rails together, butt welding the head.
ter rail and thus, the continuous, welded
rail, was introduced in this country by
the Delaware &amp; Hudson R.R. Corpo-
ration two years ago. It is long past the
experimental stage and is considered the
most outstanding recent improvement in
the railroad industry. It depends simply
on the use of a small spring clip and
tie-plate. The old expansion joint was
required because of unrestrained longi-
tudinal expansion of the rail due to the
daily and seasonal temperature changes,
the spikes preventing lateral rail move-
ment only. The welded rail became prac-
tical in the spring of 1933, when a new
method of securing rails was announced.
A double-shouldered bearing plate
"toes" the base of the rail restricting
side-play, and large threaded screw-
spikes anchor the plate securely to the
tie. Two strong spring clamps, one bear-
ing on each side of the rail flange or
base, are tightly bolted to the plate.
Each clamp is capable of exerting a
force of from 2,000 to 2,500 lbs. With
twice this restraint at one foot inter-
vals it is readily apparent that longi-
tudinal growth due to temperature
changes are of no consequence, and such
has been the experience of the D &amp; H.
In August 1933, as if in fear of let-
ting their brain-child out of sight, the
D &amp; H installed for regular service more
than 4,000 feet of welded track directly
behind its general office building at Al-
bany, N.Y. Although there were many
turnouts and breaks for signal circuits,
there was one continuous track 2,700
ft. long and another 1900 ft. For this
installation, the D &amp; H introduced a
special rail, 130 lbs. to the yard. Steel
was alloyed with small quantities of
molybdenum and manganese, giving a
good tough, hard-wearing material. Un-
til now the use of alloy steels was dis-
couraged because the rail life was
determined, not by ordinary rolling
wear, but by the end battering of the
wheels. When the projecting ends were
no longer necessary, it was better econ-

omy to use a more expensive material.
In the long run, the additional life, plus
less maintenance, more than offsets the
added cost. During the welding, the
mean rail temperature was slightly over
13S°F. An overlapping expansion joint
was especially designed and later in-
stalled 280 ft. from one end of the 1900
ft. track. In sub-zero weather, with the
computed contraction of the rail reach-
ing a grand total of twenty-two inches,
our experimental joint showed no per-
ceptible movement. Such a joint was
definitely unnecessary there.
The method of joining the rails is
an ingenious procedure devised by the
Metals and Thermit Company, who
also supervised the fusion work. A
Thermit-pressure weld is used, involving
two separate welding processes. The web
and base of the rail are joined by the
Thermit Method, while the head is
pressure welded. The rail ends are pre-
pared by cutting back a quarter of an
inch of the lower part of the web and
base of each rail. The heads are milled
at a small angle tapering away from the
top. which is the point of contact. The
surface at the joint is raised slightly
when pressure is applied, allowing for a
smooth grinding job. The rail ends are
preheated to 1800°F. while the Thermit
charge is being mixed. Thirty seconds
after ignition the molten iron, which has
reached over 5,000° F., is allowed to
flow down from the crucible into the
mold, filling the space cut out of the rail
web and base. The floating slag protects
and heats the rail head. In three min-
utes it cools to about 2,000°F., at which
time the rail ends are drawn together
with great force by the heavy clamps,
making a typical pressure or "butt"
weld. It requires but ten more minutes
for sufficient cooling to allow the clamp
and mold to be removed, and then, while
the rail is still hot, an acetylene torch
touches up all slight defects. After final
cooling and a smooth grinding on the
top and sides, the Thermit-pressure weld
is complete. All the preparations and ac-
tual welding were made on the field.
The Albany track was a complete
success. In the two years of service, only
five of the 311 welds failed. Two were
actually due to defective welding and
extreme track conditions. The other
three failures were attributed to a poor
method of construction. The track was
laid in three long sections, which were
finally welded to form the long, continu-
ous rails. It was at these section welds
that failures occurred. After this discov-
ery, welding was made from one end of
the track to the other. The track con-
struction is standard, including a 14-18
inch deep crushed stone ballast which
has served exceptionally well.
In May, 1934, 2,000 feet of continu-
ous rails were installed at Mechanicville.
N.Y., a total of 254 welds being
made. It was merely a repetition
of the work at Albany, the only
change being the use of 131 lb. A.
R.E.A. specification rail, as com-
pared with the 130 lb. rail at Al-
bany. More recently, the D &amp; H
undertook the addition of two
miles of track at Schenectady and
more than a mile near Windsor,
X.Y. The work at Schenectady
was unusually interesting, the field
work being impractical on account
of a sharp curve and a high fill.
The General Electric Company,
three miles from the scene of oper-
ations, constructed thirty-three
composite rail sections, each con-
sisting of three thirty-nine ft. rails
joined by the electric resistance or
•'flash" weld. These 117 ft. rails
were then placed on the two
strings of forty-two flat cars wait-
ing in the Mohawk yards. Clamped J^e
in pairs, the rails were Thermit
pressure welded on the cars forming two
rows 1,500 ft. long. The welding opera-
tions completed, a locomotive and der-
rick pushed the unusual cargo to its des-
tination three miles away. The rails
were not secured to the cars, but no
difficulty was experienced in making
curves even as high as 10°. Unloading
simply consisted of swinging the end of
the rail over the side with the derrick,
while the rest of it was pushed over the
edge of the cars by the track gang and
finally slid into a temporary position.
It required only fifteen minutes for each
1500 ft. section to be laid.
The argument has been presented
that welding changes the properties of
the steel around the joint so as to im-
pair the rolling flexibility necessary for
smooth riding. This has not been the
case. In fact, only for a distance of 4

PREXY
The affable,
smiling southern-
er so often seen
hastily entering
or leaving the
engineering
buildings is no
other than Frank
Denison. Frank
graduated from
high school in '26
and worked for
four years before
entering the Uni-
versity of Texas. After three years at
Texas, Frank took another year out to
work, and in the fall of 1934 he came
to the University of Michigan to pur-
sue a course in aeronautical engineering.
His cheery personality and ever-
ready enthusiasm won him a place in
the hearts of all Michigan Engineers.
One of the genial Texan's first acts upon
arrival at Michigan was to take an
active part in the local branch of
A.S.M.E. He was one of the first mem-
bers of the new Aero branch of A.S.M.E.
started here last fall and is now presi-
dent of that society.
The Open House needed a man to
take charge of making up programs.
Frank was called in, and as Chairman
of the Program Committee turned out
a job that was complete in every de-
tail. For his constructive interest and
enthusiastic participation in student
activities, Vulcans claimed him last
spring. His inimitable nature won him
the office of president of this organiza-
tion.
While Frank was schooling in the
sunny southland he established a very
creditable record and became a member
of Tau Beta Pi. When he joined the
ranks of Michigan his membership was
transferred to the Gamma chapter at
this school. Carrying out what has al-
most become a tradition with Frank, he
became President of Tau Beta Pi, at-
taining the acme of student engineering
achievement.
From a summer job in the Packard
electrical laboratories Denison has re-
turned to begin his second year at Mich-
igan and to hold down the presidencies
of three major activities—two honorary
and the other a professional society.
This may be a record of some kind;
we don't know, but, at any rate, it is^
a mark for future Michigan Engineers
to shoot at — scholarship, leadership,
and service, a combination of the three
highest ideals of Michigan.
LEADER
Every now and then an engineer be-
comes a B.M.O.C. Among the engineers
who wander into activities on the other
side of the campus is Wencel (Joe to
you) Neumann. The efficient, affable
president of the Union claims for his
residence Royal Oak, Michigan. Social-
ly he is a Delta Tau Delta and spends
the week days between the Union and
Geddes Avenue, frequently week-ending
in Detroit.
Popularity with his classmates won
him the position of Chairman of the
Soph Prom Committee. Being a good
soldier and a fine fellow he was elected
to Scabbard and
Blade. Joe's many
activities and ef-
ficient work on
the Union Staff
elected him to
Triangles, of
which he served
as president dur-
ing his junior
year. As ex-presi-
dent of Triangles
he is at the pres-
lent time a mem-
ber of the Men's
Council. No longer can you find Joe
around the Engineering buildings be-
cause he has deserted us to finish a com-
bined course in Business Administration.
Many activities have had Joe's at-
tention, but the Union has been his
favorite. In his sophomore year he
served on one of the soph committees
and as a result of his work was elected
to a post on the Executive Council. Last
spring, to the joy of all Engineers, came
the news of Joe's election to the Presi-
dency of the L'nion. Then Michigamua,
in quest of true Michigan braves, be-
stowed upon him the honor of member-
ship in their tribe.
In Joe Neumann the College of En-
gineering is losing one of its best liked
leaders and friends, and its parting wish
is of the best.
BIRDMAN
Perhaps it seems strange that a trim,
sleek bird of the air should be born in
a subterranean cavern. However, if you
had chanced to drop around this sum-
mer at the Aero Drawing Room deep
down in the basement of East Engineer-
ing Building you would have seen one
Bob Auburn toiling ardently in the mak-
ing of his latest winged pet, a 46 foot
spread sailplane. But what we want to
do is tell you something about Bob, not
his plane. You will hear more about
that later if it bears out the expectations
of its young designer.
Three years ago Bob found his way
to Michigan from down in Mt. Healthy.
Ohio. Being one of those young men
who are both modest and ambitious he
set right to work without much ado.
Spending much of his time in Glider
Club activities while a freshman and
sophomore he was elected to the presi-
dency of that organization last year. As
official representative of the Glider
Club he was a member of that worthy
bunch of sages, the Engineering Council,
and so gained their respect and confi-
dence that they elected him Secretary
for the current year. Enrolling as a
freshman in the R.O.T.C. Signal Corps
he earned the distinction of wearing the
emblem of Scabbard and Blade in his
junior year. Pi Tau Pi Sigma, honorary
Signal Corps society, also claimed him
and awarded him the office of corre-
sponding secretary. By way of di-
version Bob faithfully attends the local
A.S.M.E. Aero meetings.
It seems that Triangles, junior en-
gineering honor society, soon got wind
of the accomplishments of our young
birdman because it was only last fall
that he was seen doing a very thorough
job of scrubbing the Engineering Arch.
nln the near fu-
ture Bob plans
to take his new
plane to Sleep-
ing Bear hill and
try for the glider
endurance rec-
ord, hoping that
his only difficul-
ty will be merely
trying to keep
awake.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


EVOLUTION OF AN IDEA
Evolution, as the anthropologists use
the word, is a slow process, and these
scientists come to consider a few thou-
sand years as but a little while. Ideas
evolve more rapidly. Here is the TECH-
NIC, for example.
Both the anthropologists and the edi-
tors of the TECHNIC agree that evolution
is a development or growth—a process
by which a rudimentary form becomes
a fully developed thing. The Michigan
TECHNIC started as an idea some fifty
years ago with the founding of "The
Engineering Society of the University
of Michigan." It started because a defi-
nite need for some sort of technical news
record existed among the engineering
students of the college. It was in 1882
that the idea first appeared in material
form, an accomplishment not only mod-
ern according to publishing standards
of the 80's but with the added distinc-
tion of being a "first"—the first maga-
zine to be published by any engineer-
ing college in the country. And with
such a start, the idea had to be kept
plastic so that it could change to fit
changing needs. The needs have changed
—from those of a record book to a live,
modern engineering student's organ.
There exists right now in our own
college a need for information not sup-
plied in the class room, but which,
nevertheless, is vitally important to the
student engineer. Let us enumerate a
few of the more evident fields of infor-
mation to which we refer: (1) employ-
ment after graduation, tips on how to
get it, and then, just what a man can
expect to bump up against on his first
job, and what he can do while still in
college to make those bumps easier, (2)
first hand and authentic news of en-
gineering progress that is being born
right here in our own laboratories, (3)
technical societies and extra-curricular
interests, their meetings and progress,
their place in the modern education
structure, their value to the individual
in school and after graduation, (4)
your associates, both professors and
other students, their viewpoints and ac-
complishments. In other words, there is
an existing need which no textbook or
professional technical magazine can pos-
sibly satisfy. It is to fill this need that
the TECHNIC is published today.
This Michigan TECHNIC which you
have in your hand represents the latest
stage in the evolution of an idea. It is
a fully developed, modern student en-
gineering magazine, modern not only in
its new dress but in the sense that it is
designed to fill a current need. In this
issue and in all subsequent issues the
TECHNIC aims to follow as closely as
possible the desires of the greatest num-
ber of its readers, and change with their
changing needs. For this reason your
opinion of the magazine will be highly
valued, whether it takes the form of
praise or blame. Please let us have your
comments, criticisms or suggestions now
or at any time you think of some.
"THERE AIN'T NO JUSTICE"
The old axiom, that "the one who
cheats hurts only himself," is false. Every
student must play his full part in the
honor system because the "cribber" spoils
the game, not only for himself, but, for
every one else as well.
The "chiseler" passes the require-
ments for a degree by using your honest
answers, by sly glances into the text
book and by cautious looks at "crib"
notes subtly prepared. If he is crafty
enough he will get away with it—if
you let him. The cheater will graduate
with the same degree that you do. His
diploma testifies that he knows fully as
much as you do and, if he is a clever
"chiseler," his scholastic record may be
better than yours. To the outside world
which judges him from appearances
and from his degree (the same as
yours), he is as good a man as you—he
starts his professional career on an
equal footing with you.
But, on the job he soon finds a prob-
lem he can't solve—he doesn't know
the answer. No longer can he look at
your paper, or peek into the text, or
slyly peruse his "crib" notes. Before
long his employer will discover that the
dishonest one knows none of the answers
and will dispense with his services (?).
If this were the end of the story we
could sit back, satisfied, that at last he
had come to his just deserts, but, un-
fortunately, this is only one half of thf
story. The disillusioned employer may
not know why the "chiseler" has failed
and will view with suspicion all other
graduates from the same school. To the
man in business the "chiseler" is only
very poorly prepared. To the disillu-
sioned employer your diploma will no
longer mean that you know the funda-
mentals of the engineering profession.
All other graduates from the chiseler's
alma mater will suffer from that one
man's iniquity.
The "cribbing" student spoils the
game for himself and for you as well.
It is your duty to your college, to the
profession, to your fellow students and
to yourself to see that the honor system
is carried out to the very letter!
ARE YOU GUILTY?
Public Enemy Number One on the
campus is the professional apple-pol-
isher. When a man continuously and
obviously tries to pry his way into the
good graces of his instructors he is
doing himself an almost irreparable
harm.
For the benefit of the uninformed, the
expression, apple-polisher, is a collo-
quialism used when referring to a stu-
dent who attempts to get good grades
by playing up his personal relationship
with the instructor. In the first place, an
instructor is not so unconscious of what
is going on but what he can sense the
underlying motives of the favor-seeker.
It is not difficult to notice how such a
student differs from the one who calls
at the instructor's office for genuine
council and aid. Such contacts should be
encouraged but it is the apple-polisher
who abuses this privilege and hurts him-
self at the same time. The apple-polish-
er, no matter how nicely he is treated to
his face, is always inwardly despised by
his classmates. By far the worst result

OUTSTANDING
Because the stories of the careers of
today's prominent engineers often prove
an inspiration and stimulus to engineer-
ing students, it is interesting to turn
back the pages of time and learn how
these men have climbed to success.
Carlton R. Sabin, who recently re-
tired from the position of secretary-
manager of the Cleveland Engineering
Carlton R. Sabin
Society, was a member of the class of
'18E. However, he began his engineer-
ing career before he entered college. In
the years before his enrollment here
he worked for the Union Carbide Com-
pany as a laboratory assistant, for the
Algoma Central and Hudson Bay Rail-
road as a surveyor, and for Kibby and
Shields as a licensed marine engine op-
erator. He was employed by both the
Studebaker Corporation and the Cadil-
lac Motor Car Company.
While an engineering student, Carl
was a member of his class sing commit-
tee. He was an officer of Web and
Flange, the senior civil engineering so-
ciety. During his senior year he served
as president of the engineering society,
and he was elected into Vulcans. So-
cially he was a Sigma Chi. From time
to time during his college course, he
worked on construction projects at the
Soo.
After receiving his bachelor's degree
in civil engineering. Mr. Sabin went into
the sanitary engineering corps of the
army, and he was later a sanitary en-
gineer with an Ann Arbor firm. In 1920
Carl took a position with the Lakewood
Engineering Company of Cleveland but
left to go to the Grasselli Chemical
Company. He became secretary-mana-
ger of the Cleveland Engineering Soci-
ety in 1922, and he remained in that
position until the spring of 1935. In
this latter capacity it was his duty to
coordinate the interests of the 1500
members and ten district divisions of
the organization. He was connected
with work on concrete, machine design,
plant engineering and regional plan-
ning. He was in almost constant contact
with more than thirty committees.
In the seventeen years since he has
left college, Carl Sabin has become ac-
quainted with practically every phase
of engineering. His brilliant record
proves that he is well versed in the two
most important requirements for a good
engineer: a sound technical training and
the ability to meet and deal with people.
MEN OF 35
Fall has again come to Ann Arbor.
On the Michigan campus the leaves are
turning red and gold, and the only green
thing in evidence is the class of '39.
Student attention is being directed into
the channels of rushing, pledging, class
games, and football. Speaking of foot-
ball, former varsity gridder Tage Jacob-
son is employed at the Philadelphia
Navy yards as a civilian engineer in the
navy aircraft unit. Two other Michigan
aeronautical engineers at the Navy yards
are George Spangburg and Raymond
B. Maloy. Shih Tsan Liu is studying
for an advanced degree at Massachu-
setts Institute of Technology. Edward
Snyder has a responsible position in
the stress analysis department of the
Hammond Aircraft Company in Ypsi-
lanti. Wilbur C. Nelson is working on
his master's degree at California Insti-
tute of Technology. Last year Wilbur
was chairman of the aeronautical divi-
sion of the A.S.M.E. and was a member
&lt;jf the glider club and the varsity
band.
Among the electrical engineers of
1935, W. S. Mueller is operating the
Detroit terminal of Wirephoto for the
Associated Press. E. C. Whitney, who
belonged to the A.I.E.E. and Sigma
Rho Tau, is in the service department
of Westinghouse in Detroit. Ronald H.
Culver is in the field for Jansky and
Bailey, a radio engineering firm in
Washington. B. F. Bailey is with Fair-
banks Morse Company. George H. Ser-
vis is an assistant in the Department
of Physiology under Dr. Gesell. Z. Ly-
cassian is a physicist at the Hackett
Brass Foundry in Detroit. C. H. Arm-
strong is employed by the Clark Con-
troller Company of Cleveland. \V. K.
Boice, the swimmer, is with Genera!
Electric at Schenectady. John Brown
and Sam Bousky (engineering physics)
are doing sound measurement work on
the staff of E. J. Abbott of Ann Arbor.
The Commonwealth Edison Company
of Chicago is employing the services of
W. H. Budd.
Ken Cogger of the mechanical de-
partment is with the Acme Ball Bear-
ing Company. Lester Colwell is with
Eastman Kodak. General Electric of
Schenectady is employing the services
of Boyd C. Dennison and Louis West-
over. Johnny Schmidt and William
Nicholson are with the Linde Air Prod-
ucts Company of Buffalo. William W.
Gilbert, Ph.D. in June, and Charles E.
Kraus, M.S., have remained in their
positions as metal processing instructors.
Steiner R. Vaksdal is with Libby-Mc-
Neil and Libby, Blue Island, Illinois.
Allen B. Stevens is in the employ of the
Dunn Paper Company in Port Huron.
Dave Conklin, John English, Henry
Felker, Logan E. Tuthill, Lawrence Hat-
to, and Carlton D. Passenheim are with
Ingersoll-Rand at Painted Post, New
York. Bucyrus-Erie Company of South
Milwaukee has claimed Albert C.
Haisch. The A.C. Spark Plug Company
of Flint is employing Phil Stefanowski
and Vincent E. Ryb. Raymond G.
Schmidt is in Ann Arbor with the
Motor Service Company. Anthony
Klute, Phi Kappa Phi, Phi Eta Sigma.
Sigma Xi, MICHIGAN TECHNIC, glee
club, etc., is with the Chrysler Corp.
The remainder of the 1935 engineers
and many of the men of former years
will be featured in the November issue
of the MICHIGAN TECHNIC.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Opinion
Question: What, to your mind, are the
relative values of extra-curricular activ-
ities and studies?
DEAN SADLER ANSWERS:
It is a matter of common experience
with students of all generations, and I
presume it always will be, that they
often feel that certain studies or activi-
ties may be more "useful" to them in
life than others. If only we could have
a complete vision of what life has in
store for us in the future, such a selec-
tion would have some justification; but,
to be brutally frank at the outset, I may
say that a student throughout his Uni-
versity course has not the slightest con-
ception of what is going to contribute
most to his success in after life.
From years of experience all educa-
tional institutions have come to about
the same conclusions as to various cur-
ricula in Engineering. First, a thorough
grounding in the sciences, in order to
be able to use the principles later in
their engineering applications, and sec-
ond, a group of courses fundamental to
engineering generally, and some of an
introductory nature to the specialized
fields. Finally, some studies of a so-
called non-technical character are intro-
duced with the avowed intention of
broadening an engineer's general educa-
tion. I sometimes feel inclined to call
English a technical subject, because if
there is one thing that an engineer
needs probably more than anything
else, it is the ability to express himself
in clear and concise English.
There are two main fields in which a
man with an engineering education may
finally land today. First, the purely
professional as a designer of engineer-
ing things or as an investigator into fu-
ture developments, and second, in the
general operative and business end of
a manufacturing concern. More than
ever before the engineer of tomorrow
may be also called upon to do his part
in the economic and social world, and
in this sphere it is necessary for him to
be able to associate with other human

pertinent to this campus or regarding the field.
beings having varied interests in all
sorts of problems. It is therefore neces-
sary that in addition to his technical
training, he should also be what is com-
monly called a "well educated" man.
For the above reasons, 1 think it will
appear obvious that an interest taken in
affairs outside the routine of the general
class room work, and in certain courses
which will give a man a wider range of
vision, cannot help but broaden him as
a man, and possibly in the end may prove
really more useful to him in his career,
than additional technical work. If the
latter appears desirable, the proper so-
lution is to devote one or more extra
years to advanced study in a specialized
field.
VELVET RAILS
(Continued jrom Page 5)
inches on each side of the weld does the
Brinell hardness fall as much as twenty-
five points.
The D &amp; H sums up their points in
favor of enlarging their continuous track
program in the following manner:
1. Saving in track maintenance, es-
pecially at the joints and increased rail
life by the elimination of end batter.
2. Lengthening in the life of ties at
the joints and more efficient signal cir-
cuits due to the lower resistance of the
welded joints.
3. Reduced maintenance of rolling
stock and increased power obtained by
smoother running.
According to 1) &amp; H officials, the
cost at Albany per weld, including re-
moval of the old track was about $18,
while at Schenectady it was only $8.
This fact alone goes to show that with
a bit more experience in welding rails
the price of the process will be brought
much lower.
There is little doubt that the welded,
continuous rail is here to stay. The es-
tablishment of the "velvet" track on all
the major lines where speed and com-
fort are required is a matter of time
alone. By decreasing costs and including
speed and comfort in its service, the rail-
road industry seems destined to recover
some of its lost favoritism and by further
use of the welded rail to be once again
the most important transportation me-
dium.

article were obtained through the court-
esy of Messrs. Ferris, Fitch, and Haight

Don't Quote
Me, But—
Dear Abercrombie,
They tell me that summer is definite-
ly over. It was a great work out and
now we can settle down for rest, relax-
ation and recuperation.
Most of the lads have come back
much sadder and none the wiser.
Note, New Ways to Keep jrom Grow-
ing Old:
Mention Alexandria, Louisiana to
Harold Strickland, CA'-Union council
Brain Trust, Yes—Alexandria. La.—
poor L'ncle Harold traveled 'way down
to see the "one and only" and engin-
eered the deal of getting HER parents
to send her to Michigan. It turned out
upon her arrival that SHE knew a cou-
ple of local talent and Harold has been
unable to get a date since. Consolation:
That Oklahoma City Vassarite that still
writes.
Mention "launch" to Bob Fox, Soph
prexy of '36. Robert, while at Aberdeen,
Md. R.O.T.C. summer camp, purchased
a "fine launch," towed it across the bay
and then watched the rain sink it and
the Hoods pour over it as it rested se-
renely on the mud bottom for a few
days. Consolation: Clever Bobbie dryed
it off and sold it at an $18 profit—with
the aid of a certain charming girl's
father.
Mention "Havre de Grace Regatta"
to Chuck Framburg, "Shot" No. 1 of
the rifle team, or Red Underwood,
Union V. I'res. It appears that the boys,
while at Aberdeen R.O.T.C. camp, were
invited by sweet young things to view
the Regatta from their yacht. After cir-
culating the information sufficiently
among the other lads and successfully
impressing them and getting many envi-
ous words and glances, Dignified Chaw-
lie and Austere "Red" strode off to keep
their date. The payoff came a short
while later when a group of their envi-
ous "pals" saw them on the "yacht"-
a twenty-foot putt-putt. Consolation:
Chuck weekending at Atlantic City and
visiting country club dances with Ger-
ald Stewart and Howard lugging around
his steel filing cabinet.
Mention "dynamite" to either of the
Waters twins, far-famed pages of the
Michigan Band. At the close of school
they marched proudly off to jobs with

^ former readers, both of them:
-tings and salutations! Another year is here, so it's
11 to summer loves and sun tan. The opening of
in the fall would be a solemn occasion were it not
• ever-present freshmen. It is with a touch of melan-
that we observe their ludicrous efforts to appear
i lain. Kittens, lambs, and babies must take a back
lien compared to freshmen in the light of sheer enter-
-nt. The austere realm of Michigan is invaded by this
,-t'iitional horde every year, and it requires a firm
i &gt;n the reins to steady them down into sober and
ed sophomores. The sophomores and upper classmen
ng that they must set the example, stride along with
mien brandishing their slide rules with a fierce in-
nce that stirs the cockles of the heart. The influence
5e worthies is soon felt as is shown by a tremendous
-;e in the number of slide rules sold. By the end of the
freshmen look so much like the upperclassmen that
=t way to tell them apart is to pry open their mouths,
t their teeth, and judge the age as is done with horses.
"_?r guaranteed test is to ask them what two times two
they do it without a slide rule, they're freshmen.
TO FALL

of the fact that you are a first year man, a frosh.
^confidentially, an upperclassman leads an awful life.
te his broad shoulders rest huge responsibilities, which
FJ him to lie awake many nights bemoaning his fate
cisnging once more for the care free days when he, too,
aSist a lowly freshman. Every little cranny of his huge
at is now packed with little odds and ends of informa-
ci« Keeping all this knowledge straight so that he'll
tono trouble remembering whether 3.14159 is the value

Scjse little wrinkles of worry so noticeable on the brows

inheartedly for fear he lose that decorum and dignity
:essary to a man of his position in life. Even at Union
8
dances, his figure must be erect and trim, his carriage that
of a soldier with never a trace of looseness in hands or
body, nor dare he try those little quips and quirks so dear
to the carefree heart of a freshman. Should I continue you
would shed sad tears for the poor upperclassmen and bewail
the fate which will all to soon place you in his shoes.
Lest you stray too far from the straight and narrow,
however, the following letter will guide your footsteps.

horizon forecasting a snappy little tor-
nado. Of course the J-Hop is the big
prize in the engineering school this year.
A certain Paul Krans, Ben Cox, Rush
Bowman, "Hiram" Walker, Paul Nims,
Ben Bugbee, Harry Brelsford, Miller
Sherwood, Ralph Boehnke, Jim Gra-
ham, Al Upson, Carl Abbott, Dick

Jack Sinn, Joe Kempton, Carleton
Sherburne and about 253 other junior
engineers would be only too glad to
give their respective or even collective
right legs for the chairmanship of that
little jig. With Don Hillier, '37's soph,
prexy, modestly out of the running I
pick Carl Sherburne as the logical
choice, and other rumors to the con-
trary notwithstanding.
By this time next month I should
have all those juicy little details of not
only that J-Hop squabble, but the other
class offices and dance fights. It's a
cinch we can't all get in, so here's to
the disappointments and dashed hopes
of the next few weeks.
It's your move Ambercrombie. Say
what you like, but I'm betting old Haile
Selassie drafts Joe Louis and Mussolini
takes the count in the second round.
Keep me in touch with the world and
next month I'll write you all the new
debris on the latest births, suicides,
hitchings and Pretzel Belles. If "some-
thing" should happen in the meantime
send me a white gardenia.

at least here and there he will find
much that is durable and satisfying.
No engineer should be like one of my
friends who plays a good game of bridge
and a tolerable game of golf but who
boasts that he hasn't read a book in
twenty years. A year or two ago one of
my students became so much interested
in anthropology that he declared it
should be made a required subject in
the University. I wish that all might
be as enthusiastic as he.
ARE YOU GUILTY?
(Continued from Page 7 )
of apple-polishing is that the art be-
comes a life long habit. The man who
goes into the industrial field with the
"don't forget me, teacher" attitude will
not get far. As he was despised by
his classmates, so will he be hated by
his fellow employees. But, whereas he
simply was ignored in college, his busi-
ness associates will take active steps to
have him removed from the premises.
The erring one's employer will regard
him in much the same light as did his
professors. Although the man's flattery
and sham willingness to work may ap-
peal to the boss' ego, the apple-polisher
will still be an object of contempt.
When promotions come, he will be left
behind—if he holds his job at all.
The art of apple-polishing is much
too prevalent in colleges today. It is
unfortunate that public school teachers
often encourage the practice, and men
who have lived for the glory of the
teacher's praise since the grammar
grades find it difficult to get along with-
out it now.
Do your instructors arm themselves
with sickly grins when you recite or
come into their office? Do your class-
mates openly snicker? Then stop and
analyze yourself! Are you polishing the
apple? If so, take yourself in hand
before it is too late. There is no short-
cut to the rewards of honest toil.
CORRECTION
A statement in Professor H. H. Hig-
bie's article, "The Department of Elec-
trical Engineering," on page 156 of the
May 1935 issue of the TECH NIC read:
"General Jan Smuts said, ' . . . science
... in its selfish pursuit of truth ..."
This was due entirely to an oversight
on the part of the editors and should
have read, "... in its selfless pursuit
of truth . ."
UPTURN IN
ENGINEERING
RESEARCH
by PROF. C. W. GOOD
Statistics on the Work of the Depart-
ment of Engineering Research for the
past fiscal year as compared with those
of the previous year reflect the im-
proved business conditions throughout
the country. While the Department was
established as a division of the College
of Engineering, it has served as a de-
partment through which business may
utilize the University's laboratory facili-
ties and personnel in connection with
their fundamental and developmental
problems.
Because of the nature of its function
the amount of work done through its
function depends upon the attitude of
industry toward the spending of funds
for research work. A few years ago the
policy of industry was one of strict re-
trenchment, while last year the tension
in the financial world had eased slight-
ly with the result that there was an un-
anticipated increase in the demand for
the University research service.
During the past year, the total busi-
ness transacted by the Department
amounted to practically $130,000.00.
This represents a 70% increase over the
previous year.
Another item of interest is the num-
ber of students employed in connection
with the research work. One hundred
and seven were employed during the
last fiscal year, representing an increase
of about 50 per cent over the number
employed for the previous year. Like-
wise, the average amount of compensa-
tion received by the students was greater
than that of the preceding year. While
the financial aid received by the students
through their remuneration for this
work is undoubtedly a factor in aiding
the students to continue in school, the
principle benefit which the students de-
rive from working on projects is ob-
tained through their association with
the Faculty members on interesting in-
dustrial research problems.
Most of the students working on re-
search projects are registered in the
Graduate School, although some under-
graduates are employed.

THREE hundred and twenty-five modern
factory buildings, located on a site cover-
ing 250 acres, house the extensive manufac-
turing facilities of The Dow Chemical Company.
More than 250 useful and essential chemical
products are produced. The major source
of raw material is the brine pumped from
nearby deep wells, which is rich in bromine,
calcium, and magnesium. This natural resource
is separated into its component parts and
recombined under scientific direction into the
various compounds manufactured. The growth
of the Dow Plant to its present size indi-
cates the extent of Dow service to industry.

Direct Current Transmission
Dr. C. H. Willis, of Princeton Uni-
versity, and B. U. Bedford, and Dr.
F. R. Elder, both of General Electric
Co. have developed a method of con-
stant-current direct-current transmission
of electrical power. This has been ac-
complished by the use of electronic de-
vices including Thyratron and Phano-
tron tubes. While the idea of direct cur-
rent transmission is by no means a new
one, it has not been successfully carried
out in a commercial capacity until now.
The advantages of a constant-current
direct-current system are extremely nu-
merous including no wattless power
transmission, a reduction of power flow
in a circuit should a short occur rather
than an increased flow of power, the
amount of power flow is at all times un-
der the control of the operator, and
many others.
Test lines have been installed and
successfully operated at Schenectady.
Such a method of distributing power is
much improved over the present alter-
nating current transmission system.
Heating a Building With Cold Water
Engineers of the General Electric
Company and American Gas and Elec-
tric Company developed and installed
reversible air conditioning equipment in
the New Atlantic City Electric Com-
pany building at Salem, NJ. This ap-
paratus cools the air in the summer and
heats the air in the winter simply by
reversing the process.
During the hot summer months this
heat pump, as it is called, acts as any
household refrigerator only the cycle
is reversed, taking the heat and mois-
ture out of the air in the room, and
compressing it to a high enough temper-
ature level to be dissipated outside.
When wintry winds are blowing the
same process goes on only the heat is
taken from a well which has a uniform
temperature of about 56 degrees the
year around. The heat is absorbed by
the gas refrigerant which is compressed
mechanically to a high temperature and
then allowed to give up the beat thus
obtained to the room. The use of a deep
well gives the process the same capacity
regardless of outdoor weather condi-
tions.
This development while not being
revolutionary reduces the electricity re-
quired to heat and cool a room, and
incorporates the devices for heating,
cooling, and air conditioning in the same
equipment.
Controlled Atmosphere in Steel Treating
The high temperatures to which steels
are heated for treating often give rise
to many undesirable properties. To pre-
vent scaling, oxidation, or carburization
of these temperatures special atmos-
pheres must be provided. This is not a
simple problem to contend with because
even H..O and CO2 are oxidizing agents
under these conditions. To have a re-
ducing atmosphere means that decarbu-
rization may take place—an objection-
able and unsatisfactory alternative.
The best atmosphere has been found
to contain CO, CO., H,O, H,, and CH,
in certain ratios depending upon the
temperature of treatment and the com-
position of the steel.
Rubber Paint
Difficulties in the utilization of rub-
ber for paint making have been the
large percentage of diluents required to
obtain a suitable viscosity, and the tend-
ency of rubber paints to thicken. Means
of avoiding rubber in solution—in which
form it is viscous and thick—are emul-
sions of rubber and also mastication.
"Torensit" or chlorinated rubber has
been used in a colloidal solution with
ethers, aromatic hydrocarbons, or halo-
genated hydrocarbons rendering a paint
that is non-inflammable, resistant to
atmospheric and chemical corrosion, and
is fire retarding—a paint well qualified
for naval painting. The Goodrich Com-
pany has done considerable research on
rubber varnishes meeting with promis-
ing success in this field.
Cooling the Depths
The recovery of gold at heretofore
impractical depths is now being plan-
ned, although there are many difficulties
to be overcome. The most important are
the danger of pressure bursts of rocks
and the reduced efficiency of human
labor subjected to the high temperature
and increased humidity of these depths.
Air conditioning schemes that have prac-
tical possibilities are: refrigeration of
downcast air at the surface; under-
ground refrigeration with a specially
suited refrigerant in mines where suffi-
cient cooling water is pumped to the
surface; and the dehydration of com-
pressed air at the surface, for use under-
ground in suitable air motors.
Underground refrigeration will be
dangerous because of the poisonous com-
mercial refrigerants. However, if cool-
ing water is available, a safe refrigerant
can be used because the heat taken
from the refrigerant and also the heat
generated by the machinery can be car-
ried to the surface by the water. Any
refrigerant used underground must be
harmless to the workers as well as non-
inflammable since there is always the
possibility of its being released by the
collapse of rocks.
Compressed air is naturally the best
possible medium for mine cooling be-
cause it is harmless and because no re-
turn duct is necessary. Engineers have
visualized that much of the equipment
at the mines will be powered by air
motors exhausting cold air in the down-
cast pipe. Some have gone even further
and put the air compressors themselves
underground providing sufficient water
is present for cooling purposes. In-
creased depths add no difficulties as far
as compressed air is concerned.
Esparto Papers
The urgent need for more paper in
Great Britain about the middle of the
last century caused the introduction of
Esparto grass, a vegetation of North
Africa, but also a cultivated product
in Spain, the latter being the best for
paper pulp. This grass has the same
function that wood pulp has although
the use of wood was initiated some ten
years later. At first the use of Esparto
grass in paper making seemed to be
doomed because the chemicals which
were used in treatment polluted the
streams. However mill engineers rushed
to the rescue when authorities objected,
and by a recovery process eliminated
this objection.
The use of this grass is peculiar to
British paper making, the United States
using wood pulp instead. Esparto pa-
per is in most aspects superior to sul-
phite wood paper although it is more
expensive. Its non-stretchable qualities
combined with softness makes it ideal
for lithographing. Also a smooth firm
grade is produced which is excellently
adapted to multi-colored work. Its
smooth writing surface and general high
quality greatly commend it as a writing
paper.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Associate Professor Frank Howard Stevens of the En-
gineering Mechanics Department died at his home in Shelby-
ville, Indiana on September 7, 1935. His absence will be
felt deeply by the whole University. His commendation
lies not in the fact that he equipped students almost per-
fectly with a technical knowledge, but rather that his char-
acter and remarkable personality made it a pleasure for
his students and friends to associate with him. He con-
ducted his classes in a personal, and yet a thorough manner
and he was also admired greatly for his vast knowledge,
about which he was always so modest.
The beloved "Ma" Stevens was born in Orange Town-
ship, Rush Co., Indiana in 1878. Here he spent his child-
hood and received his elementary schooling, as did his
parents and ancestors before him. Throughout his youth,
all his mother's efforts were bent in an attempt to make
him adopt the ministry. Finally, however, his father agreed
that his mother would not object too strenuously if he
were to be a teacher. He proceeded to study with determina-
tion, and attended DePauw University Prep School, Indi-
ana State Normal College and the University of Chicago.
He obtained his B.S. from the University of Chicago in
1908, with, as he modestly admitted, "Honors in Mathe-
matics and Work done in Senior College." Not satisfied
with this schooling, he proceeded to take a year of post-
graduate work at the U. of Chicago and a year at the U.
of Michigan. During these years he studied every course
in Mechanical and Civil Engineering taught in the Univer-
sity, for they had Engineering Mechanics as a prerequisite.
Before Stevens came to Michigan, he established an
enormous reputation throughout the State of Indiana as
a mathematics instructor. For fourteen years before he
obtained his college degree, he taught and was head of the
Mathematics Department of Terre Haute High School,
and he even taught two summers in Indiana State Normal
School. His teachings in the University have also been long
and colorful. For eight years he taught mathematics, until
in 1916, he transferred to the fast-growing Dept. of En-
gineering Mechanics. Here he earned the reputation of being
one of the best teachers on the faculty, judged by profes-
sors and students alike. Despite his failing health, he taught
until this past summer.
His only industrial connection was with the Sparks-
Withington Company, of Jackson, Michigan, with whom
he has been associated continuously since the summer of
1918.
Professor Stevens' outside activities, in which he took a
great pride, are also worthy of mention. He was a member
of the Society for the promotion of Engineering Education,
the Ann Arbor Chamber of Commerce, Life Member of the
Michigan Union, member of the Knights of Pythias, Red
Men and Kappa Sigma Fraternity.
To say that his death was a great blow to those who knew
him is only a mild expression of the sentiment for him.
Dean Sadler expressed himself thusly: "Professor Stevens
has been on our Faculty for the past twenty-seven years.
He was generally regarded by both his colleagues on the
Faculty and the students as one of our best teachers. He al-
ways gave his time most generously to those students who
seemed to be in difficulty with their work. His loss will be
felt keenly by all who knew him."

Seventy delegates representing sixty-five chapters regis-
tered at Detroit for the annual convention of Tau Beta
Pi, honorary engineering society, held at Lansing, Michi-
gan on October 10, 11 and 12. A well rounded program in-
cluded business meetings, a tour of the Edison and Ford
plants in Detroit, a smoker here in Ann Arbor with the Gam-
ma Chapter of Michigan as hosts, a dance, football game
and closing dinner at Lansing. Philip Singleton '35E, last

Technic Sends Delegates to Philadelphia
Notice is hereby given that in case five members of
the TECHNIC Staff turn up missing this week that they are
not playing hookey and neither have they transferred to
the other side of the campus. They merely will be taking
a few days off to represent Michigan at the Engineering Col-
lege Magazines Convention in Philadelphia. The convention
brings together editors of student engineering magazines
from all parts of the country in an effort to further and
improve this type of publication. The University of Penn-
sylvania lads, hosts to the Convention, have promised to
top off the heavy program of meetings with an evening of
soft lights, sweet music and Pennsylvania co-eds. Further
information may be obtained after October 20 from Bob

Aero Branch of the A.S.M.E.
In spite of the group's comparative youth, the Aero
Branch of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers
has shown itself to be one of the country's most progressive
and growing student engineering societies. At the beginning
of the school year 1934—35 the Aeronautical engineers felt
the need of some organization in order that they might bene-
fit from the experiences in the aeronautical field and at the
same time become more intimately acquainted with each
other and the faculty members in their own department. The
club is indebted to Wilbur Nelson, the first president for his
initiative in its organization. No less important was the co-
operation afforded by Mr. Springer, of the Aeronautical De-
partment, and Professor Boston.
The activities in the past year have included lectures,
motion pictures, and trips. The lectures covered such sub-
jects as: "Airport Management," "The Wind Tunnel and
its Uses," and "Navy Flight Training Methods." Trips
were made to the 1st Pursuit Squadron headquarters at Sel-
fridge Field, to the Stinson Aircraft factory, the Detroit
City Airport, and the Packard Motor Company. High spot
of the year was the trip to the Packard Company with the
Mechanical A.S.M.E. division. The plant was inspected and
later in the day both divisions were guests of the Detroit
A.S.M.E. at the Detroit Yacht Club. This trip introduced
to the student engineers two engineering marvels: the Pack-
ard "120" and the Yacht Club's boneless fried chicken.
The announcements concerning meetings will be posted
on the various bulletin boards throughout both the East and
West Engineering buildings. All student Aero Engineers
are cordially invited to attend the meetings.

The fireless locomotive is not a new
development. More than a century ago
in an era of bad roads and difficult
transportation man discovered the de-
sirability of having some mechanical
means of transporting himself and his
freight from place to place. It was also
discovered, early in this same era, that
transportation over a track would be
safer, more rapid, and less affected by
the weather, to say nothing of the pos-
sibility of greater comforts. At this time,
the steam engine was still a source of
wonder and experimentation because
men did not know or understand the
use of fire and metals to the extent that
they could apply sufficient fire to a
boiler to produce a steam pressure high
enough to make the steam engine prac-
tical without great danger to life and
property. Naturally, most thought was
turned to the development of some type
of fireless locomotive. Horse drawn, sail
driven, and hand propelled carriages on
rails came into considerable use, but
were not satisfactory because they could
not transport a very heavy load over any
great distance at a desirable speed.
The first important step in the de-
velopment of the fireless locomotive was
made in Germany, where, in 1822, ten
years before the advent of railroads in
this country, a compressed air locomo-
tive was invented. This locomotive was
nothing more than a large tank mounted
on wheels, from which a pipe led to a
single cylinder, transmitting the power
to the wheels. The radius of operation
of this locomotive was limited, but it
marked an important step in the devel-
opment of fireless locomotives. From this
time on, the development of both the
compressed air and steam locomotives
progressed rapidly. Although the steam
locomotive became the more powerful
and rapid, and thus the more popular,
the development of the compressed air
locomotive continued because it pos-
sessed certain advantages that the steam
operated locomotive did not have. Chief
among these were the noiseless opera-
tion, cleanliness, the lack of the danger
of fire to property, lighter weight, and
more simple and consequently more
rugged design and construction.
These advantages, embodied in the
principle of the compressed air loco-
motive, have been retained in its de-
sign as it is manufactured today. The
modern locomotive is essentially a high
pressure plant operating a compound
air expansion engine at a lower pressure
through a reducing valve. The tank is
built as large as possible and strong
enough to stand pressures as high as
two thousand pounds. This tank is
connected to an auxiliary reservoir
through a reducing valve which reduces
the pressure to two hundred pounds.
This reservoir is connected to the high
pressure cylinder on one side of the
locomotive. A balanced throttle valve
is often used in this connection to en-
sure a uniform working pressure. The
air leaves the high pressure cylinder at
fifty pounds and passes to the low pres-
sure cylinder on the opposite side of
the engine, in which it expands to at-
mospheric pressure. Often the air in pass-
ing from the high to the low pressure
cylinder is externally heated. The power
and radius of operation of this locomo-
tive have been increased. Three hun-
dred tons at a radius of twelve miles
without refilling is considered very good
operation of this type of locomotive.
These locomotives require an extensive
compressed air system which makes
their use prohibitive unless conditions
warrant this expense.
The steam locomotive became preva-
lent because it possessed greater ad-
vantages. The compressed air locomotive
was developed because it possessed
properties that the steam locomotive
did not have and which were valuable.
Next, the electric locomotive generally
displaced both the steam and com-
pressed air locomotive because it pos-
sessed most of the advantages of both
and a few others. Finally, the internal
combustion locomotive is displacing the
electric because of its advantages over
all of the other types. Thus each devel-
opment meant a greater advancement,
because each possessed all the advan-
tages of its predecessor and eliminated
some of its disadvantages. Still, the
compressed air locomotive has found
its place in transportation facilities in
such places as mines because it has
neither fumes nor fire and does not re-
quire a transmission line as does the
electric locomotive.
The newest type of fireless locomotive
which will answer the requirements of
this job is actually a fireless steam lo-
comotive.
The principle of this locomotive is
the steam accumulator which is used in
the power house to make the pressure
in the steam line from a boiler uniform.
The accumulator is nothing more than
a large tank filled with hot water at
the boiling point corresponding to the
pressure in the steam main connected to
the boiler. When the steam consump-
tion of the plant falls below normal,
the pressure in the main rises and the
hot water in the accumulator absorbs the
steam and its heat. If the pressure in
the main should suddenly drop, for ex-
ample, when many steam hammers are
used, the pressure in the accumulator
being lower, some of the hot water in
the accumulator would flash into steam
and tend to keep the pressure in the
steam main up.
This principle applied to the locomo-
tive has resulted in a simple construc-
tion which consists of a heavily
insulated boiler connected through a
reducing valve to the cylinder which
transmits power to the wheels. The
boiler is filled about seven-eights full
of hot water from the plant boiler at a
pressure near three hundred pounds.
As the pressure drops, some of the water
flashes into steam and the engine can
operate until the pressure has been re-
duced so low that no steam will be
generated. This locomotive can travel
about thirty thousand feet, and since all
boiler losses are centralized in the
plant boilers, it is very simple and rug-
ged in construction and is, in itself, very
efficient. It also can be used on a min-
ute's notice, and in a plant using steam
it does not entail the extra expense of
an air compressor used by a compressed
air locomotive.

SUNSET FACE
Only a chosen few ever attain the
title of Brave and among these is Fos-
ter Campbell. Late last Spring, after
an afternoon of sweat and toil, he was
initiated into the Tribe of Michigamua
and was appropriately christened "Sun-
set Face."
Socially "Foss" is a Phi Gamma Del-
ta and is now secretary of the local
chapter. Politics attracted him and h&lt;?
was nominated for J-Hop committee-
man. Of course he was elected and was
subsequently chosen vice-chairman of
the Hop committee.
Though modest, "Foss" is a hird
worker. His outstanding work as a
member of the sophomore staff of the
'Ensian got him the job of Editor of the
'34-'35 Student Directory. Because he
was the most promising senior on the
staff of the 'Ensian he was selected for
the Editors job for the current year.
According to all reports the '36 'Ensian,
under the editorship of "Foss" Camp-
bell, is going to be something entirely
new and different in year books.
A year ago "Foss" was entered in a
roller skate race around the central por-
tion of the campus. The result of the
race was that he was initiated into Tri-
angles. Last Spring the anvils rang—
"Foss" was being initiated into Vulcans.
He now holds the office of vice-president
of that society.
Foster confesses that his plans for
the future are indefinite. He also mod-
estly admits a desire for an executive
position in the Engineering Profession.
His cheery smile, modest demeanor, and
unusual industry should carry him a
long way in his chosen field, mechanical
engineering.
COSMOPOLITE
During his three years on the cam-
pus, H. Warren Underwood has been
enrolled in many different student ac-
tivities. Red did not confine his activi-
ties to the engineering college alone,
but started his sophomore year by join-
ing the Glee Club and Choral Union.
At the same time he was an assistant
on the TECH NIC staff and a tryout at
the Union. In the spring of his second
year Red was appointed to the Execu-
tive Council of the Union and was also
enlisted by the men of Triangles to
wash the Arch and try his luck at roller-
skating.
Last year Underwood started out by
acting as a counselor at the Freshman
Rendezvous camp. At the same time he
was gathering news of engineering
alumni as Alum-
ni Editor of the
TECHNIC. Last
spring Red's vocal
talent was enlisted
for the rendition
of the "Anvil Cho-
rus" at the annual
initiation of Vul-
cans. He was soon
elected as their
representative to the Engineering Coun-
cil. At the spring elections, Red's grow-
ing popularity won him the position of
Engineering Vice-President of the Union.
This year he is treasurer at his fra-
ternity, Theta Xi. As a captain of the
regimental staff of the R.O.T.C. he is
in charge of supply. He is also a mem-
ber of Scabbard and Blade. Despite the
scarcity of his time, Red is an instruc-
tor in the Glider Club and an active
member in the Transportation Club.
Red is an able candidate for a B.S.E. in
Transportation in June and we feel sure
in saying that he will have little trouble
in finding a job and settling down. By
the way, LTncle Chudleigh has the dope
on Red and by the looks of things that
settling down should be made a lot
easier with the addition of a second
party. Tally Ho!
SCHOLAR
Robert Warner, chem engineer ex-
traordinary, is one of those rare indi-
viduals commonly known as sharks.
Yes, sir, Bob really knows his business
when it comes to playing around with
stills, evaporators, autoclaves, and such.
We will even forgive him for the time
he was overheard to say to one of his
admiring classmates, "How can you ex-
pect to get through Ch.E. 5 when I only
got a B in the darned stuff"?
With a physics scholarship in high
school as a starter, Bob enrolled in the
University of Michigan in the fall of
1932 as a Freshman Engineer. He soon
drew attention to himself by winning
the A.I.Ch.E. award offered each year
to the sophomore chemical engineer
who made the highest scholastic record
in his freshman year. Keeping up his
fine work, Bob shared with one other
engineer the distinction of being elected
to Tau Beta Pi in the first semester of
his junior year. This society further
honored him by electing him corre-
sponding secretary for the current year.
Warner also finds time for other than
scholarly pursuits,
as is evidenced by
his active interest
in the local branch
of the A.I.Ch.E.
Last year this or-
ganization entrust-
ed to him the jab
of representing it
on the Engineering
Council. TheCoun-
cil, further recognizing a good man when
it saw one, made him secretary for the
year. Vulcans, senior honorary engineer-
ing society, then came along and ad-
ministered to Bob the rites of member-
ship in the clan of the ancient fire god.
Bob's home residence is now in Ann
Arbor, and he is affiliated with the Tri-
gon fraternity. Few of his friends know
that he is an ardent sailing enthusiast
and spends his summers sailing the
Great Lakes in a small catboat which
he built himself.
Whatever the future may bring to
the rest of us, we are certain that for-
tune will always smile upon Bob, for
"he has what it takes."
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


EXECUTIVE
Several years ago Willard H. Dow be-
came president of the Dow Chemical
Company of Midland, Michigan. This,
however, was only one more bright spot
in an already brilliant career.
In 1919 Willard Dow took his de-
gree in chemical engineering. During
his college career, he had distinguished
himself in more than one field of activi-
ty on the Michigan campus. He was
business manager of the MICHIGAN
TECHNIC, and he was initiated into
Pi Delta Epsilon, honorary journalism
society. Two chemical organizations,
Alpha Chi Sigma and Alchemists,
claim him as a member. He belonged to
Vulcans and was socially a Theta Delta
Willard H. Dow
Chi. In his senior year he worked on
his class Michiganensian committee.
Upon receiving his degree, young Mr.
Dow entered his father's firm as plant
operator. Nine years after his gradua-
tion he became general manager and
assistant treasurer and remained in this
combined capacity until 1930.
His interests, however, have been
even broader than the Dow Chemical
Company. Mr. Dow has served as vice-
president and director of the Midland
Ammonia Company and as vice-presi-
dent and director of the Jones Chemical
Company. He is a Mason and a Shriner.
He belongs to the American Institute
of Chemical Engineers, the American
Chemical Society, and Berlin's Deutsche
Chemische Gisellschaft.
Undoubtedly Mr. Dow paved the
way for his success while he was yet
in college. His fine academic standing
and his varied extracurricular activities
combined to give him technical skill and
the personality of the well-rounded in-
dividual.

NOVEMBER, 1935


A. D. MOORE
Professor of Electrical Engineering
and in charge of placement, E.E. Department
You do not know how to write a job-
hunting letter. That goes, literally, for
nine of you out of ten. And you had
better learn. Last week I sat in the of-
fice of a Detroit business man, who had
advertised for an engineering sales as-
sistant. He showed me a stack of let-
ters of application. Except for about two
letters, the stack was not worth the
trouble involved in pushing it into the
waste basket.
When you write that letter, either
conform to business usage and put it on
8.5 by 11, or don't write it. Never write
it on someone else's stationery. Ordi-
nary business correspondence never ap-
pears except in typed form. Neither
should yours. You may type the letter
yourself, if you can do a good job that
is no compromise with shoddiness in
any respect; otherwise, get somebody
to type it for you. Let handwriting b?
but a reluctantly adopted alternative. If
you must write by hand, either do a
good job or let it go.
Imagination and the creative instinct
are valuable assets, but not when ap-
plied to the formal parts of a letter of
application. Please, please do not as-
sume that you know all about this let-
ter business. Get a copy of Hadida's
"Pitfalls in English" (Putnam) or some
such manual, and find out exactly how
these things are done. While on a ten-
der subject, what of your spelling?
Think of the graduates who have writ-
ten back to me and spelled it "Prof-
fesor." Note the many seniors who write
"proceedure." Dwell on the case of the
man who spends four years playing with
our apparatus, and still writes and
speaks of "lavatory," meaning labora-
tory. The pertinent question is: Are you
wise enough to know that your spelling
is shaky somewhere, and do you know
enough to have a friend check over your
letters before you send them?
Letter Content
Design the letter with care. Very
often, the purpose of the letter is to se-
cure an interview. The almost invariable
rule is: No interview, no job. Hiring
sight unseen is extremely rare. When
your letter gets there, it is the only
thing there to represent you. Unless it
is one of the few that commands atten-
tion and earns respect, you are accept-
ing an almost insurmountable handicap
from the very start. The interview is
not granted. Or if it is, the employer is
likely to sit before you, constantly re-
minding himself that "this is the chap
who used his girl's perfumed station-
ery; his fountain pen ran out halfway,
making it a two-color job; he failed to
get my title right; he ended in a rush
Here it is! This first of a new
series of articles on employment
gets right down to brass tacks.
The information will come in han-
dy sooner or later, so why not save
it?
Professor Moore, our first con-
tributor, says of this series, "Al-
though the articles are addressed
to seniors, the hope is that no
freshman will pass them by. We
can define a good senior in 1939
as a man who learned certain
things about the job-getting busi-
ness back in 1935, and began
working on himself right away."
The second installment will ap-
pear next month.
with 'Very truly yrs.'; yes, I remember
this man's letter."
What to say? So many exceptions
come in, that the subject is too broad to
attempt writing comprehensive rules
here. Carefully think out the minimum
requirements: find the things you must
say, then say them concisely and clear-
ly. Beyond such a limit you hardly
dare go, unless you are one of those few,
blessed with imagination, good taste,
and maturity of judgment, who knows
he can add touches lending a personal
Professor Moore
distinction to an otherwise prosaic doc-
ument. If you can do this, it is invalu-
able. If not, emphatically do not try:
it would turn an otherwise successful
business letter into something ludicrous.
Some day, as an engineer, you will
have to send an engineering report by
mail. The situation also calls for a let-
ter of transmittal. You would not dream
of thinking that, since you must write
a letter anyway, you should recast the
whole report and shove it bodily into
the letter of transmittal. Now, a similar
mistake can be made if you try to cram
all the factual data about yourself into
your letter of application. If you had an
engineering report on yourself, you
would mail it to the employer, and your
letter of transmittal would become a
letter of application. This brings us to—
The Typed Personal Record
The personal record may be thought
of as a special form of engineering re-
port. Its subject is—you. It is typed.
It is in outline form. Every item is so
presented as to be easily found. It must
always give the minimum required facts.
It may contain more, depending on your
judgment. The form, the general appear-
ance, the sequence of classifications—
these constitute a make-up or design
that should be your own. A wide lati-
tude exists within which your material
can be suitably arranged. Do not make
your job look exactly like one you have
seen: consciously make it your own. to
give it individuality. That the paper
should be standard size need not be
mentioned.
The personal record may vary from
one to five pages in length. Many re-
6
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


with me usually manage to cover be-
tween one and two pages. A graduate
ten years out may have to adopt an in-
genious tabulating scheme to compress
his varied experiences into an accept-
ably short document.
The record serves at least three
needs. It enables you, perhaps for the
first time, to know your own experi-
ence, training, education, and value.
When a copy is filed with your faculty
placement officer, you are giving him
just the fine cooperation he needs in
helping to place you now or later. And
a copy placed with the employer pre-
sents you to him in the form of a high-
grade report. These needs indicate the
content.
Content of the Personal Record
1. Photograph. Perhaps the home
town paper honored your departure for
college with a story, and wisely includ?d
a picture to prove to the incredulous
that there was no mistake in identity.
Of course, you saved a clipping. Leave
it intact; that half-tone print will not
serve here. As a senior, you are being
photographed for the 'Ensian, to a size
of 4 by 6. In general, that is too large.
Get a relatively inexpensive photograph
made, size 3 by 4 or a little smaller.
Never send a snapshot or a bad photo-
graph; omit entirely rather than com-
promise. Never place the picture on the
record so that it will be folded and
creased in mailing.
2. Personal Facts. Such items as
name, address, telephone number, date
of the record itself, your age at that
date, place of birth, height, weight,
state of health, whether married, whe-
ther there are children or other depend-
ents—these usually head the record in
outline form.
3. A filiations. Memberships in hon-
or and professional societies are given.
4. Education, Training. The high
school may or may not be mentioned.
The college, degree, and date of gradu-
ation must be given. A breath-taking
omission occurred when one of our
graduates remembered everything ex-
cept to say in his record, that he ever
graduated anywhere. Advanced degrees
are of course mentioned. Any special
training, such as one gets within numer-
ous industrial training set-ups, is set
forth.
Under Education, some go so far as
to list all college courses taken. Prob-
ably the typical employer would con-
sider this as going too far with detail.
However, a selected list of courses con-
sidered most valuable and which might
be most pertinent for a certain kind of
employment, ought to go in.
5. Experience. Err on the side of
completeness. Tell the jobs you have
held before, during, and after college.
One little item, such as selling groceries
one summer, may seem insignificant to
you; it may turn out to be the very
thing that separates you from the group
of applicants and hands you the job.
Selling groceries is sales experience, it
means getting along with fellow hus-
tlers, and it involves meeting the cus-
tomers—pleasant, cantankerous, and all
kinds between. Did you earn college ex-
penses on some menial job in the hos-
pital? Then you are one of the very few-
graduates having any kind of extended
hospital contact whatever. A manufac-
turer of therapeutic apparatus might
want you for design, development, or
sales. Companies making unusual fin-
ishes, paints, flooring materials, sound
absorption materials, surgical supplies—
all these would prefer a man who had
Out into the cold, cold world in quest of a job
happened to spend four years working
in any capacity in a hospital, to others
who had not.
6. Activities. (Remember, the se-
quence of divisions is up to you; if you
prefer to list Activities right below Ed-
ucation, do so. I'm putting them here
to be sure they get into the story.)
Cla^s offices, memberships and offices
held in societies and student activities
—all should be mentioned. Does every
employer expect that all his recruited
graduates shall have a long record of
activities? Not at all. Some would pay
no attention to it. A few might even ob-
ject to it. when looking for a certain
type of man. Most of them will tolerate
a decent amount of activity background,
and many will insist on some.
7. Xcw Objects Planned, Designed,
or Built. Here we come to the gadgets.
Many seniors have been tinkering for
years, planning or building model en-
gines, model airplanes, radio sets, and
so on. Make clear those that were real-
ly built, as against those that never
got beyond the design stage. The late
B. G. Lamme, so long and so eminently
the chief engineer for Westinghouse
Electric, interviewed thousands of grad-
uates. He always inquired into this kind
of self-imposed activity. He considered
it essential to the make-up of every to-
be-successful engineeer. It may well be
that he gave the matter undue emphasis;
but due to his influence, you may be
assured that many employers of engi-
neers think the same way about it.
8. Special interests. You can bring
these out strikingly, in part, by putting
red stars on those courses (under Edu-
cation) whose content most represents
the lines you wish to follow. A foot-note
can explain the stars. Then, in a para-
graph or two, state your special inter-
ests. One of our men roomed in the
house of a married "Medic" student;
due to long talk-fests there, and with
other particular motivations, he took
an unusual dose of work in the Arts
college. He wound up with a permanent
and informed interest in sociology, men-
tal hygiene, medicine, medical appara-
tus; and said so in his personal record.
Another man stated that he had been
reading Lester's "Marketing Industrial
Equipment" on his own time, and had
been following current articles along the
same line. Since he wished to locate in
sales engineering, he had listed a valu-
able special interest in an up-to-the-
minute way.
9. Preferences. You may hesitate to
mention two or three or four prefer-
ences, fearing that some employer may
pass you up if the opening he has does
not quite fit with your desires. Indeed,
the fear may be justified. But, you can
hardly leave him completely in the
dark; he is quite likely to do the same
to you—which is fair enough. He does
not want to ask you to come across th°
state for an interview, only to find that
you don't want his sales job. On the
positive side, if he is looking for a
production man, and you have said you
wanted to be one, you begin to get to-
gether with him right away. Of course,
preferences are to be stated in general,
functional terms. An older man may

tional horsepower motors; that is his
line, and has been for years. You will
say, as a recent graduate, that you want
design of small rotating apparatus. And
put down about three preferences, not
just one. It is seldom necessary to state
negatives. However, if you positively
will not consider something—such as
sales—say so.
10. References. It is customary to
cite as references, one or more of the
men you have already worked for. They
are used to these matters, and will take
it as a matter of course. As a college
man, such references will not complete
your list. You must not fail to refer
to at least one faculty member. Other-
wise, the employer will assume that for
some reason that ought to be smoked
out, you left college under such a cloud
that you would rather not have your
name brought up on the campus any
more than can be helped. That isn't
the case—but what is he to think? No,
you do not need to ask permission of
any faculty member in order to refer
to him. Whether or not you ask him
about it, he will be glad to respond to
inquiries, and he will tell the facts as
he sees them in either case. Now, there
is often good reason for asking him
first: you thus make more certain that
he really will remember you. It lessens
the chance that in a couple of years he
will be mistaking you for the classmate
of about the same size, weight, and de-
gree of difficulty in keeping awake in
that early afternoon class.
11. (....?) Write your own ticket.
It is by no means intended that when
ten categories are listed above, you will
faithfully have all ten—no more, no
less. Make the job your own. And after
reading this, do not get in wrong by
trying to bedevil some poor faculty
member into telling you in detail how
to do it. Get to work and design the
record. Type it to see how it will look.
Then, if you wish, take it to a faculty
member and ask for suggestions.
It is entirely legitimate to get all the
ideas you can from personal records
already available. We have plenty on
file in the E. E. Department. The secre-
tary in room 274 (mornings only) will
be glad to let you look at several at
your leisure.
To close this matter of personal rec-
ords, a striking instance may be cited.
A recent graduate carefully informed
himself before he left the campus. He
shortly sent me one of the best records
I have ever seen. A few days later he
called on a certain firm in his home city,
and handed a copy to the girl. She
cheerfully passed it in to the chief en-
gineer, and promised it would receive
attention. However, she told the gradu-
ate not to wait. It was not customary to
grant an interview the same day. He
chose to wait anyway. In five minutes
he was called in. He answered three
questions and in ten more minutes was
hired. Total elapsed time, fifteen min-
utes. He's there yet.
The second section will begin with a
discussion of the personal interview.

hesitate before buying a refrigerator
until we are assured that it is "stream-
lined." The American public has ac-
quired a taste for "curves" and hence,
the manufacturer must produce an au-
tomobile body closely conforming to our
conception of a perfectly streamlined
shape. This novelty of streamlining,
however, will dim with age and with its
passing a firmer science will be estab-
lished. Soon it will no longer be possible
to claim improved performance through
streamlining without showing results.
Progressive manufacturers, realizing this
fact, are turning to the wind tunnel for
a scientific study of the character of the
airflow as it affects the operation of
their product.
It may be of interest to first point out
some of the principal industrial and
scientific fields that have made good use
of the wind tunnel. It is natural to as-
sume that inasmuch as the wind tunnel
is closely associated with aircraft that
its sole utility lies in research concern-

true. Whenever a vehicle, structure, de-
vice, or mechanism, is designed to oper-
ate in the presence of air and such op-
eration is seriously affected by the air
then, frequently, it becomes a problem
suitable for wind tunnel investigation.
It has been found that such vehicles as
trains, street cars, automobiles, and air-
planes can be tested very easily and
the results of such tests serve to suggest
means whereby improvement in design
can be made. Innumerable examples of
other and equally interesting problems
may be found on every hand. A brief
survey of the various fields of engineer-
ing show that: the civil engineer will
be interested in air pressures on his
buildings and aerodynamic effects on
bridges and towers; mechanical engi-
neers are able to improve the design of
cooling systems and radiators of internal
combustion engines: electrical engineers
will wish to investigate the effect of
wind velocity on transmission lines and
towers; and, finally, heating and venti-
lating engineers will want to study heat-
ing problems related to buildings and
houses.
Experience has taught the aeronau-
tical engineer that the simplest and least
expensive procedure to be followed in
developing an airplane is to study a
scale model in the wind tunnel. Ofttimes
the results obtained thereby are more
useful and applicable than those ob-
tained from flight tests for the reason
that greater control may be maintained
over the large number of variables likely
to occur under free flight conditions. In
a practical sense the wind tunnel imi-
tates free flight through the expedient
of artificially creating and controlling a
stream of air as it is directed past the
model in the test chamber. Therefore
the value of the tunnel lies in the rigid
control of various experimental vari-
ables such as wind direction, velocity,
temperature, and density. It is obvious
then that observations relative to the
aerodynamic behavior of the model can
be obtained and thus in turn applied to
the full scale unit.
Since it is possible to make use of
The Lockheed "Electra" was tested in the University
scale models in the study of airllow
problems the cost of development work
can be reduced considerably. It is much
cheaper to build a model, test it, and
thereby gain much needed knowledge
regarding its performance than to spend
a large sum of money making changes
on the full scale device with the hope
that such changes will result in im-
proved characteristics. Very often if this
procedure is followed it will be necessary
to resort to tunnel tests anyway. There
are instances of manufacturers building
airplanes without troubling to test them
initially in the model form. However,
experience has taught them that it is
much more sensible to spend a small
sum of money on preliminary research
than to unnecessarily drain the financial
resources of the company by proceed-
ing with an untried design. There are
cases of airplanes having been built at a
cost of $10,000 to $20,000, only to be
completely scrapped in the end. Sup-
pose on the other hand that this money
had been spent in tunnel research. One
can well imagine that the final results
obtained would be much more valuable.

subsequent results from model tests
failed to prove the changes as desirable,
thereby resulting in considerable saving
to stockholders.
Our wind tunnel at the University of
Michigan has been in operation about 8
years. During this time the laboratory
has been of service to an increasing
number of clients. A large part of this
work has been concerned with problems
not directly associated with aeronautics.
The following is a list of projects, se-
lected at random, which illustrate very
well the multiplicity of tasks entrusted
to the wind tunnel during this period.
1. An experimental study of the air
resistance encountered by trains. The
Union Pacific streamlined train was
tested here.
2. A study of the air resistance of au-
tomobile bodies.
3. The calibration of wind velocity
recording instruments.
4. A study of the aerodynamic effect
of wind on the behavior of stack gases
from industrial smoke stacks.
5. The aerodynamic development of
a large, commercial, airplane, such as
the new Lockheed "Electra."

Committee on Pipe Courses
the course of investigations of the sub-committee a
need for some method of rating pipe courses has been
The tendency in pipe courses has, of recent years,
ig from fewer and easier blue-books to an increased
ber of bolts. Therefore, a method of calculating the
able number of bolts in a course would be very de-
le. Many factors enter into this: the type of course,
weather, the building in which the course is held, etc.;
the most important factor is the instructor. With this
lind the committee has developed a formula for the
jlation of the probable number of bolts given by an
uctor. As a first approximation this may be taken as
number of bolts in the course.
jr convenience in calculation it was found desirable to
&gt;duce a new unit, the Brier. Thus, the standard Brier
fined as one bolt per credit hour and has the dimen-
il formula N^VT'^S3. The unit has been named in
r of Prof. J. C. Brier who at one time forgot to come

size of the instructor (usually a finite number). The
portance of this was, in early investigations, neglected,
but following the publication of F. A. Upson's "Diophan-
tine Analysis as Applied to the Relation Between Hat Size
and Verbal Ponderosity of Engineering Instructors," the
factor came into general recognition among the experts in
the field, n represents the permeability of the instructor, a
quantity which varies with the hour of the day. Some of
the early investigators thought this was a logarithmic func-
tion of the dinner hour. (c.f. Rush Bowman, "The Dinner
Hour Function.") Recent wind tunnel experiments con-
ducted at the University of Michigan have indicated that
the relationship is not a simple one but may possibly be
represented by a Fourier Series.
By using this equation it should be possible for the
student to so pick his instructors as to have a painless, if
not pointless, schedule.

That professors are prone to human errors as well as
mere students is evidenced by the following true instances.
Professor A. H. White drove into a local gas station,
some time ago, on the very unscientific mission of getting
some gas. Arriving there he found the gentleman in at-
tendance in a condition bordering on hysteria. When the
fellow finally stopped laughing, the Professor questioned
him as to what had caused all the fuss. It turns out that
shortly before a gentleman, described by the attendant as
"a foreign man who walked with his head bent and his
hands clasped behind his back" walked up to him and said,
"Put five gallons in the car."
The attendant looked around rather startled and asked,
"What car?"
The "foreign man" looked up calmly, glanced around and
remarked, "Well, I guess I left it home this morning."
Another member of the engine school faculty, Professor
Liddicoat, was puttering around preparatory to retiring.
Finally arriving at his room, his wife asked him what the
milk bottle was for. Looking down, he found that he was
carrying a milk bottle and when he went down to the back
porch, there, sure enough, was the alarm clock waiting for
the milkman.
"May I come in?" he said. "It's the room I had when
I was in college in '09."
"Yes, sir," he said, lost in reverie. "Same old room. Same
old windows. Same old view of the campus. Same old closet.
He opened the door. There stood a girl much embarrassed.
"This is my sister," I said.
"Yes, sir. Same old story!" —Rose Tecfinir

UNION
Don't Quote
Me, But—
Dear Abercrombie:
Xo preliminarmies this time, so let's
get down to business, (a la Winchell):
What prominent junior engineer
(soph prexy last year) while week-
ending at Wisconsin left Madison after
the game in a big hurry to get to Chi-
cago, and after driving for about three
hours arrived in Milwaukee? Guess
they don't mark the roads out in that
country.
What well-known red-headed senior
engineer (Union vice-pres.) gets es-
corted almost every day at 11 from mid-
campus to the arch—and then she turns
around and walks back alone. Service
with a smile, eh?
\Vhat soph engineer (Daily sports
writer) takes week-end trips to Mid-
land? He goes up with a blond—to see
a brunette. Should be a diplomat, not
an engineer.
What red-headed junior (would-be
politician and Union "shot") was re-
cently taken for a ride by ens of the
many Birmingham products? She's a
frosh transfer. He'll learn after a few
years—maybe.
What frosh engineer (Initials: G.
"Berwanger" W.) was seen a few weeks
ago playing solo football in scanties at
5 A.M. on the lawn of his State Street
Club?
Abercrombie, it may be my youth
but somehow there are things I just
can't figure out:
Take the case of Bill Jewell, junior
"cut-up," for instance. It seems that
Bill fell downstairs a few weeks ago
and walked around for several days be-
fore he realized his leg was broken.
Never thought Bill was that kind.
And that list of Bob Reed-Hill's:
Bob's girl (incidentally she and Bob
have had their Annual Fall Battle—no
hits, no runs, no errors—armistice de-
clared as usual) gave him a list of the
"best-looking Frosh girls" for dates for
Robert's pals. The funny thing though,
was that several were marked—"NOT
FOR 'SCRATCH' WALKER."
Y'know at the Union student offices
there is what is known as the "inner con-
ference room." Like all well-appointed
conference rooms it has a comfortable
davenport, several over-stuffed chairs,
and soft blue lights. It happened that
at the Union Formal Rush Bowman,
as usual, decided to hold a "conference"
so he and the "one and only" of Olivia
Ave. left the dance floor and went down
to the office. As it was all dark, Bow-
man unlocked the door and Rushed in
—coming face to face with Bob "In the
Dark" Dailey, etc. Mutual blushes
were exchanged and Bowman Rushed
out—the only thing that surprises me
is that it wasn't "Joe" Neumann or
"Red" Malone in there.
Neil Levenson and his junior from
Midland (Daily staff) have decided that
it's "incompatibility."
Chuck Marschner was a bit overcome
to find that his chief heart interest has
accepted a "rock" from grad Elmer
Dixon.
Jim Graham broke his dates for the
Union Formal, Interfraternity Ball and
J-Hop all at one whack.
It would appear that Carl Abbott has
given up the Detroit "baron's" daughter
in favor of local talent from the farther
Tappan club.
You may have to kick the floor to
see him; you may have to watch your
step to avoid squashing him; but none
the less and notwithstanding he'll be 18
on December 22. I refer to that "small
boy" •— frosh engineeer — Jack Failing
Thorpe of Detroit. So don't let looks
deceive you, he's as old as most of us
—and his middle name is a terrible mis-
nomer judging from the past. Treat th?
"Little Giant" with respect hereafter.
A gardenia to the soph engineers in
general as almost they alone defended
the great name of "38" in the Frosh-
Soph games. The soph boys from the
other side of the campus must have
"Lit" out.
They tell me that Jim Wicks and
Dick Johnson often have trouble round-
ing that corner from So. U. into Forest
Ave. at 4:00 A.M.
Gotta go Abercrombie—I wonder if
they still dump out the "unknowns"
in Chem 5E; put in some crazy con-
coction; ask the instructor for help and
then razz him when he can't figure out
what in h— the "unknowns" are. Some
fun.
Yours—till later,
love,
Chudleigh.

Pipe Lines that couldn't fail
and didn't... Wltfl J.l
OVER the wastes and swamps of the Deltas of the
Mississippi River, pipe lines had to be laid for a
sulphur plant. Failure was unthinkable! Once laid,
these lines had to stand up ... without leakage or
troubles that would jeopardize operation of a costly
investment. This was the exacting demand that had
to be met. .. even though piling for the trestles to
support the line would sink 30 feet of its own weight.
Only one method of joining the piping for these lines
could meet such brutal specifications. Lindewelding
was the answer. From a past record of thousands of
miles of pipe lines laid under all sorts of handicaps,
Lindewelding had proved itself the type of joint-
less construction that would stand the gaff.
Lindewelding was used to install two 12 in. water
lines, one 6 in. oil line, and one 14 in. gas line over
miles of trestle. In addition, eight miles of 6 in., 8 in.
and 10 in. lines were installed in the sulphur field
running from the plant to the wells and other points.
After installation, these lines were tested under 200 Ib.
water pressure . . . without a leak!
TODAY, after a year's operation, the lines have
required no maintenance . .. developed no leaks.
During design and construction, Linde engineers
extended to this company every cooperation to insure
the most effective and economical welding procedures.
You also, can get this kind of help when you need it
from Linde Offices located in principal cities through-
out the country and at 30 East 42nd Street, New
York, N. Y. The Linde Air Products Company, Unit
of Union Carbide and Carbon Corporation.
*Lindewelding is a new method of oxy-acetylene welding
developed by the Linde engineering and research organiza-
tions. This method requires less oxygen, less acetylene and
less welding rod. Welds can be completed in less time. Yet
Lindewelding involves only a special flame adjustment
and a "back-hand" technique, together with Oxweld No.
24 Lindeweld Process Welding Rod. When circumstances
permit, the Multi-Flame Lindeweld Head can be used
to increase further the speed of Lindewelding. This head
costs $7.75. Lindewelding is consistently saving 15 to 40
per cent in welding time, rods and gases.

Think?
Question: Will an engineering college gradu-
ate with a master's degree go further in his pro-
fession than one with only a bachelor's degree?
A. H. WHITE ANSWERS:
He certainly ought to and probably
will. If this is not the case a lot of
people are going to be badly fooled,
for the enrollment figures of last year
showed one-fourth as many graduates
as there were seniors in the engineering
colleges of the United States. The pro-
portion of graduate students has been
rising rapidly because of calls from em-
ployers for men with more advanced
training than can be given in the four
year program. The law of supply and
demand holds in education as in manu-
facturing. Engineering in its technical
aspects is based upon mathematics, phy-
sics, and chemistry. The advances which
have been made in the two latter sci-
ences in the last generation are being
reflected in increasing complexity in
engineering work, for every advance in
the basic sciences brings new problems
to the engineer. Experience is an invalu-
able asset to an engineer, but experi-
ence does not tell how to solve new
types of problems. Men are wanted who
can find the path when experience is
helpless, and problems requiring a new
approach may be solved only by those
who know the fundamental theory and
are able to use it effectively. The abil-
ity to apply theory to industrial prob-
lems is a mark of a master engineer.
The representatives of the large cor-
porations who come to my office to in-
terview students seeking employment
seem to be rather in agreement that a
student with four years training is ade-
quately equipped for a beginner's posi-
tion in plant operation. Modern plants
are operated in accordance with a pro-
gram which has been established only
after careful study. The plant super-
visors must carry out this program
effectively, harmoniously and economic-
ally. It is a field which is worth a man's
best efforts, but it does not call for the
theoretical knowledge nor the mental
initiative required in the development
division. Young men for this latter
work should have quick minds in addi-
tion to perseverance and personality. As
a usual rule, a student should not un-
dertake graduate work unless his scho-
lastic record shows that he ranks above
the average in his class. Since he is to
be working with new projects and in
new fields he must be an independent
thinker and must be thorough in his
work. Such a man will go further in his
profession because of graduate training.
One year of graduate training is good,
but there is a strong and increasing
demand for men capable of going di-
rectly from the University to respon-
sible positions in research and develop-
ment work. For men with the right
mentality and personality, not only the
master's, but also the doctor's degree is
a good investment.

KIPKE'S
ENGINEER
When you sit in the Michigan Stadi-
um and watch the 1935 Wolves take on
the Gophers and the Buckeyes on suc-
cessive Saturdays, watch No. 60 of the
Maize and Blue. No. 60 is an engineer,
6 feet tall, first string fullback, and
weighs 190 pounds. His name is Ced-
ric Sweet, '37E and he comes from Fre-
mont, Michigan, which is over Muske-
gon way.
On the Fremont High team Ced was
either center or fullback and was captain
of the team in his last year. He earned
an All-State position at the same time.
Entering Michigan in 1932, Ced won
frosh numerals in both football and
basketball. Unfortunately, illness forced
him out of school the second semester.
Despite this handicap, Ced returned in
1933 and won a Varsity "M" in 1934.
Last spring Triangles selected Sweet
for his outstanding ability. All this time
he worked for his room and board and
acted as "bouncer" at Mr. Butterfield's
Michigan Theater.
Ced's football this year has been be-
yond reproach. He scored the only
Michigan touchdown in the State game
by receiving a pass from Renner on the
goal-line. He backed Indiana down the
field with his punts and baffled their
safety man with a 50-yard punt that
gave Michigan a touchdown. His con-
tribution to the win over Wisconsin was
the best blocking play of the day when
he took out two men to clear the way
for a touchdown by Smithers.
Ced is studying engineering because
"it offers one a larger and more inter-
esting future than any other profession."
He is working for a combined Aero-
Mechanical degree.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


HONORED
Albert Easton White, Professor of
Metallurgical Engineering and Director
of Engineering Research of the Univer-
sity of Michigan, is the new vice-presi-
dent of the American Society for Test-
ing Materials.
While an undergraduate at Brown
University, Bert White was known as
a quiet boy who did his work well and
left fame and publicity to those who
were more desirous of it than he. He
was well liked by his classmates of 1907
and by his brothers in Phi Delta Theta.
In his sophomore year he played center
on his class football team which did not
have a point scored against it in two
years of competition. His deep loyalty
to Brown has shown itself in his active
participation in alumni affairs.
Through Professor Kenerson of.
Brown, Mr. White became interested in
Metallurgy. Consequently, he went to
Harvard for a year of graduate work
in that field. In 1908 he joined the staff
of Jones and Laughlin Steel Co., where
he was in charge of research on blast
furnace by-products. Mr. White became
an assistant in metallurgy at the Uni-
versity of Michigan in 1911 and was an
assistant professor from 1913 to 1917.
During the World War he served as
head of the metallurgical inspection di-
vision of the U.S. Army Ordnance Ds-
partment. In 1919 he became professor
of metallurgy at Michigan.
He is a past chairman of the A.S.M.E.
Research committee, and he was first
president of the American Society for
Metals.
In 1925, when Prof. \Vhite received
the honorary degreee of Doctor of Sci-
ence from Brown University, the late
president, W. H. P. Faunce, cited him:
"Professor and Director of Engineering
Research in the University of Michigan,
consulting engineer in large American
enterprises, who in the few years since
he left Narragansett Bay has gained the
confidence of both men of science and
men of business, the gratitude of his
students, and the glad recognition of
his Alma Mater."
RAYON FROM SOUTHERN PINE
As a result of four years of research
and experimentation, satisfactory ray-
on has been made from pine Sulphite
pulp by the State Engineering Experi-
ment Station of the University System
of Georgia. It is desirable to have a do-
mestic source of rayon pulp since the
spruce sulphite pulp habitually im-
ported for this purpose is subject to
various price factors. At first the at-
tempt was rather unsuccessful, but, as
the operating and controlling technique
was perfected, a good viscose was ob-
tained.
MELTING DOWN
Ice was recently used in a novel way
in New York City. It was necessary to
lower some 3200 feet of nine-duct tele-
phone subway to a greater depth with-
out interrupting service. Ordinarily a
large crew of men equipped with blocks,
screw jacks or chain hoists would have
been needed to do this job, as the duct,
weighing sixty tons per 500 feet, is
very fragile and inflexible, and leaks or
breaks of any kind were to be pre-
vented. A much smaller group of men
excavated holes every six feet under the
duct large enough to accommodate a
large cake of ice. The intervening earth
was then cut away and the ice left to
melt. In about two days the subway
had been gently lowered to the desired
level on this cushion of melting ice.

AUSTENITIC GRAIN SIZE IN CAST IRON
Because the properties of gray cast iron are inconsistent
and vary even though the same composition and conditions
have prevailed in manufacturing the pieces, Dr. D. W.
Murphy and Professor W. P. Wood have conducted certain
experiments at the University of Michigan to investigate
this apparent paradox. They found this erratic behavior to
be dependent primarily upon the austenitic grain size in the
matrix of the cast iron (this grain size is to be distinguished
from the ordinary fracture grain size that is found from
the ordinary fracture test which is influenced by the gra-
phite flake size and distribution). The results of various
carefully managed tests showed that the irons with coarse
austenitic grains were stronger, harder, more easily dis-
torted, and were more deeply hardened on heat treating
than fine grained irons; hence the variation in the proper-
ties of iron in the as-cast condition is directly related to the
austenitic grain size.
Only plain irons were investigated, but the conclusions
drawn indicate that austenitic grain size of cast irons will
in the future be relatively important. Undoubtedly alloyed
irons will be similarly tested.
WHICH COAL TO USE
Engineers and executives are very apt to neglect many
necessary considerations in selecting a coal, or often they
are too easily influenced by coal salesmen when purchasing
coal. There is no "rule of thumb" method for determining
the coal which will be most economical, but a definite pro-
cedure can be outlined. The objective is, of course, to dis-
cover the coal that will give the cheapest steam, regardless
of the price, quality, or heating value. To find which coal
that is, primary operating requirements are studied such
as ability to carry the plant load, responsiveness to chang-
ing demands, adaptability to equipment, and ash fusion
temperatures. Then fly ash, tendency to smoke, and such
other supplementary factors as reliability of coal seller and
services rendered by him are considered. This narrows the
field to three or four coals. Thirty to sixty day tests are run
on each kind to establish the one most economical to use.
RECORD OF HEAVY RAINFALLS AIDS ENGINEERS
The Bureau of Agricultural Engineering, U.S. Depart-
ment of Agriculture, has prepared an accurate record of
the intensity and frequency of heavy rainfalls in localities.
This chart shows the most intense precipitation that has
occurred in periods of 5 minutes to 2 hours. Also, records
of precipitation of 4 hours to 24 hours are noted and the
possibility of re-occurrence is stated. Such data will aid
engineers building farm terraces, draining works, highway
culverts, city storm sewers, and other works designed to
care for storm run-off.
EFFECT OF FURNACE ATMOSPHERES AND TEMPERA-
TURE GRADIENTS ON PORCELAIN ENAMELING
Recent tests have confirmed the suspicion that the
moisture content and general composition of furnace atmos-
pheres used to fire porcelain enameled products are impor-
tant considerations. In fact, a moisture per cent of 10 or
over will cause trouble from blistering, copperheading, and
generally poor surface texture. Furthermore, in metal en-
amel processes acid gas (carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide,

surface texture, especially if the condition is present in the
firing zone proper. Cast-iron enamels are more susceptible
to these injuries than sheet steel enamels. Copperheading
caused by oxidation of metal surface can be eliminated by
lowering the pre-heat temperature of the metal.

THE PERSONAL FACTOR IN
ENGINEERING
Engineering today calls for more
than a sound technical training. In the
past, a good technical training record
has spelled success for the young en-
gineer, but modern industry has an-
nounced a new requirement for admis-
sion—that of personal development.
Why?
Since this is so important,—or isn't
it? Let's back up a minute. What right
has a college magazine editor to say
that personal development is a prereq-
uisite for success in engineering? That's
a fair question, and there are several
answers. Suppose we take a look at a
survey made by the Westinghouse Com-
pany on the factors determining which
engineers kept their jobs and which lost
them as a result of the depression. The
lean years were a time when industry
could afford to keep only its very best
men. What did these men have that the
others lacked? The Westinghouse sur-
vey showed that of the qualities of the
men retained the three that were most
noticeably lacking in the men released
were ability to sell one's self, aggres-
siveness, and an impressive personality.
Only ten per cent of the men released
were considered deficient in technical
training. But this evidence alone need
not be taken as conclusive. It is only
necessary to look about you to see what
makes a successful engineer. Individual-
ly recall those you know and note that
their personal assets weigh almost as
heavily as their purely technical ones.
Three summers of work in industrial
plants has convinced the writer that
personality and group consciousness
penetrate as far as the pay envelope
even in the lesser jobs. However, please
do not misconstrue these statements to
mean that personality can take the
place of technical training. Technical
ability is the prime requirement; per-
sonal qualities are the number one addi-
tional requirement.
How?
Now, to get back on the original path
of the story, since this personal factor
is so important how can we develop it
before we get out on the job?
One method is to take an active part
in extra-curricular activities. By "active"
is meant actually participating in the
activities of the group, not just going
to a meeting once or twice a month. If
you happen to be in a meeting that is
opened to discussion, be more than a
"sitter in"—take part in the discussion
and develop the ability to express your-
self. Talk and converse with other peo-
ple whenever you have an opportunity.
Conversation is an art. As such it re-
flects the personality of its creator. In-
telligent conversation requires a broad
store of information. Read something
beside textbooks and professional jour-
nals.
Group experiments in a laboratory
course are an excellent method of test-
ing temperament, tactfulness, coopera-
tive ability, and similar qualities. A
large part of engineering work is done
under group conditions.
Another method of bringing out and
developing personality is to get a job
selling something during summer vaca-
tion. Philip Swain, editor of Power, in
a recent talk before a group of engineer-
ing editors stated that one of the most
valuable parts of his education came
from a job he once had as a young man
of selling household articles from door
to door. A salesman must win his cus-
tomer—he must please him; and that
is where the personal factor comes into
play, or else—no sale. This business of
pleasing people is highly important, es-
pecially to an engineer. The greatest
part of the world's work is done in an
effort to please somebody, and the per-
son doing the best job of pleasing gets
the privilege of doing the work.
So What?
Scientists and technicians are influ-
enced just as easily by likes and dis-
likes and prejudices as any other class
of people. No matter how brilliant a
man may be he cannot be successful in
group activities unless he can obtain co-
operation. He must have the respect and
liking of his fellow workers. For his
greatest success he must be sufficiently
aggressive to convince others of the
value of his activities, and he must sell
himself to his superiors.
INSPECTION TRIPS
Why doesn't the university sponsor
more inspection trips? Here we are
strategically located in the center of one
of the greatest industrial areas in the
country—Detroit, Toledo, Flint, Jack-
son, Lansing, all within easy motoring
distance, but industrial inspection trips
through these cities are pitifully few.
The chief reasons for the infrequency
of trips seeem to be lack of time and
lack of transportation facilities. In most
courses the semester's work is planned
so carefully and closely that time out
for a trip or two means getting hope-
lessly behind in class-work. Why not
make allowance for a certain number
of trips in a course and plan the work
accordingly? Trips would necessarily
have to be limited to only a few courses
because the time loss affects not only
the course sponsoring the trip but all
other courses missed by the student.
The students themselves are the ones
who must cooperate in supplying the
transportation. It is up to the student
to offer his cooperation by bringing a
car whenever it is at all possible. This
economical method of transportation is
the only way of making it possible for
all the members of the class to go.
Inspection trips should be particular-
ly valuable to the student because they
give him an opportunity to see in actu-
al industrial operation the things he has
studied in class. They tend to fix these
things in his mind and allow him to
comprehend more fully just how en-
gineering principles are made use of in
industrial practice. Remember the old
Chinese proverb, "One look is as good
as a thousand words"?
Let's have more inspection trips.
The Encyclopaedia Britannica sets
forth the following as the duties or
functions of a "professional engineer":
"the engineer is under obligation to con-
sider the sociological, economic, and
spiritual effects of engineering opera-
tions and to aid his fellowmen to ad-
just wisely their modes of living, their
industrial, governmental, and commer-
cial procedures."

PATENTED LILIES
WHEN left to their own devices, regal lilies get
themselves all spattered by yellow pollen.
It's a messy business—like a man in a white linen
suit spilling egg yolk all over his vest. So the florists
have to watch these blooms carefully and pluck
the pollen-laden anthers before they have a
chance to burst.
In the General Electric Research Laboratory,
C. N. Moore, Dartmouth, '05, has for years been
investigating the biological effects of x-rays. Among
I other things, he treated 75 regal-lily bulbs with
varying amounts of x-rays. Untreated bulbs of the
same batch grew up normally. Among the treated
bulbs, there were some monstrosities and some
apparently normal flowering plants. The results
were different the next season. The progeny of two
of the bulbs that had received 30-second doses
of x-rays produced flowers with nonshedding anthers.
Each year the new strain has continued true, and
the nonshedding property is considered a fixed
characteristic. The Roentgen lily, as it is called, is
now established as a variety of regal lily.
AWARD FOR COURAGE
¥N the face of a difficult and serious competitive
situation, the entire personnel of the Tennessee
Electric Power Company, of Chattanooga, under the
leadership of its president, proceeded to develop
one of the most unique sales programs ever carried
out by an American public utility. Every individual
in the organization, regardless of position, became
a salesman for the company's kilowatt output.
One of the bases of this program was a substantial
reduction of rates. The result was a great increase
in electric-appliance sales, and a 26-per-cent increase
in residential consumption.
The company co-operated in the sale of appliances
with dealers, with the TV A, and with the EHFA.
Its industrial department has been at least partly
responsible for the location of 29 additional indus-
tries, employing 1995 workers, in the territory it
serves.
For these accomplishments, the Tennessee Electric
Power Company received the annual award for 1934
of the Charles A. Coffin Foundation, which was
established by General Electric in 1922 in honor
of its first president. The award comprises the
Charles A. Coffin gold medal, a certificate, and a
check for $1000 to be deposited in the treasury of
the utility's employee welfare association.
GOOD-BYE, GARBAGE CAN
r I 'HE oil furnace has placed the skids under the
ash can. And now, a new device developed in a
General Electric laboratory promises to do away
with the garbage can. This new device, operated by a
14-horsepower electric motor, grinds the waste food.
Grinding knives made of Carboloy—a metal next to
diamond in hardness—shred all types of waste food,
including bones and other hard substance. The only
things it cannot handle are glass and tin cans.
Reduced to a fine pulp, this waste is flushed by
water into the sewer.
The grinder is simple to install and operate.
The entire unit weighs about 75 pounds, and may
be installed under any style of sink as a part of the
outlet plumbing. The hopper inlet is covered by a
perforated cap, flush with the sink bottom. When the
hopper is full, all one has to do is turn a handle
which projects conveniently from beneath the sink.
This closes the hopper and starts the grinder.
In the average family, the grinder will operate not
more than five minutes a day, and its average cost of
operation per month will be about one-half that
required for operating an electric clock.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Professor of Electrical Engineering
and in charge of placement, E.E. Department
Some interviews are easy to obtain.
An employer's representative comes to
the campus, you sign up for an inter-
view, and that's that. At the other end
of the scale is an interview you seek,
and which takes place in the employer's
office. Let us talk about that kind. As-
sume that the employer has written to
me, asking for candidates. I dip into
my file of available men and select four
names. Maybe I really found six who
might qualify, but only four have com-
plied with the well-publicised request
for filing personal records; two others
have not, and are often passed by for
that reason. Why? If a man will not
go to a small amount of trouble to
participate in a plan erected entirely
for his own benefit, how can I believe
he will take care of an employer's in-
terests in any better style?
Next, having the typed records at
hand, I can make sure the four are
qualified, with no loss of time. Dupli-
cate letters are now sent to the men,
apprising them of the opening, and
giving the essential facts of the case.
At the same time, I write to the em-
ployer, and at least tell him the names
of the men he may expect to hear from.
If I have time—and often I don't—and
if the occasion may warrant, I may also
discuss each man in the letter to the
employer.
It is now up to each man to telephone
the employer for an interview date; or,
to write a request for that privilege. If
the request is by letter, the candidate
includes a copy of his personal record.
This brings him eventually to an inter-
view, provided he is not rejected sight
unseen for reasons arising from the
employer's reaction to letter and record.
Assuming you are granted an inter-
view, you get there ahead of time. In
the next twenty minutes you decide
your fate. I assume you have already
learned (forgive these personal details)
that pants look better when pressed;
that a recent close shave improves any
male of college age or over; that finger
nails need cleaning as well as cutting;
that there is at least once when it is
well to sit up straight and favor the
other fellow with a few direct looks—
which is right now. The employer has
usually had some practice at interview-
ing, and he will probably lead the con-
versation. To any questions, give direct
and clear replies. If he dangles an op-
portunity for you to run off at length
on some tangent, be wary. Perhaps he
is looking for that very trait. You came
here about this job, and not to issue a
half-hour alibi for the football team.
Of course, if it appears that he really
wants to take time out to discuss foot-
ball, skeet shooting, or the soya bean
crisis, let him have his way and even
contribute to the sin. But be careful.
Don't ever make the mistake of as-
suming that all employers are interview
experts. Some certainly must find inter-
viewing quite a trial. When the poor
man seems hesitant about prying into
your qualifications, he may need help.
Take the lead and tell your story to the
best of your ability—keeping your
twenty minutes in mind. He is a busy
man, but kindly and courteous. He may
make it easy for you to overstay, but
will take sharp and secret objection to
any serious transgression. If you err on
the safe side by attempting to leave too
soon, he will hold you; don't worry
about that. If he keeps you all morn-
ing and then takes you out to luncheon,
it is a safe assumption that matters are
going rather well. But look out for
luncheons. It will then be too late for
anything but regrets, if you do not
already know how to handle yourself
at table. This does not finish our dis-
cussion of interviews; we will have to
come back to it later on.
How You Can Fit In
You are about to graduate; it is
customary for graduates to secure em-
ployment and make a living; therefore,
you propose to follow custom. Well, no
graduate is ever handed a job on that
basis. The hard cold world doesn't
care a whoop whether you, individually,
get a job or not. The only reason you
will ever be hired is because you have
convinced some employer that it will
pay to take you on. Now, it is true that
a few large companies recruit a large
group of men each year, the only im-
mediate concern being that each man
be desirable. The company is big
enough to use any one man later, in
almost any line along which he may
develop. That is campus recruiting;
you can learn of it here, firsthand. It
is quite a different story when you ap-
proach an employer who has no jobs
open.
You make such an approach because
this is one company you would like to
be with. You secure an interview. The
employer is glad to look you over, at
least. Now get this picture: that morn-
ing he, the chief engineer, has had a
Can You Fill the Other Chair?

call for decisions. His patent expert
was in a while ago to raise a question
he will have to settle, and he doesn't
know the answer. Nobody knows the
answer. Shortly before you arrive, a
report is dumped on his desk, calling
for a close decision as to whether to
spend fifty thousand for scrapping old
machinery and buying new. A letter
from the chairman of a national com-
mittee is clamoring for his company's
answer on proposed changes in a code.
His wife is on the telephone, asking him
to help guess whether little Philbert's
temperature is due to scarlet fever, in-
digestion, or cussedness inherited from
the father's side. And then you walk in.
He didn't ask for you in the first place.
He cannot use you now. Unaided, he
can't see where he might use you six
months hence. If you simply appear as
a large, blushing graduate who wants to
work for him, all you are doing is to
hand him one more vexing problem he
can't find the answer to. Did you just
remark that such a chief engineer's
morning is rather unusual? Well, maybe
you are right; many of his mornings
are easier to get through than this one.
Doesn't it become rather clear that
under such circumstances, you had bet-
ter come prepared to help him solve
your problem? It is possible for you to
come to the interview knowing a great
deal about the company's products;
advertisements, trade journal articles,
gossip, friends—there are many possible
leads. You learn that certain products
have not switched over to welding—
which is one of your preferential in-
terests. You are prepared to suggest
that you might be taken on in any
capacity whatever, just so you could
learn still more of welding problems and
needs, and could soon be of value in the
application of welding.
Some of his company's products are
intricately shaped. You have learned
that diecasting is used to the limit, but
that apparently plastics have been left
alone. You learned something about
plastics in college, and have picked up
a good deal more from recent publica-
tions. You do not rudely take the
gentleman to task for not having lost
his head over plastics, but you do find
a chance to say how fascinating it would
be to have a job where such adaptations
might work well and save money.
Of course, all such preparation may
usually miss the mark. As long as you
are an outsider, you may never be able
to smoke out a thing the company isn't
already alive to and worried about. The
point is, that the employer will be pleas-
antly astounded to interview a recent
graduate who is thinking more of the
employer's problems than his own. You
will not be hired that day; he can
think of no excuse for wedging you in.
Two weeks or three months later, that
man may call you long distance (pro-
vided you include your telephone num-
ber in your record) and ask you if you
can go to work next Monday.
NEXT MONTH
Should I work for a large or
small company? What should I
know about the company I want
to work for? To what things in the
letter and interview does the em-
ployer attach the most impor-
tance? All of these questions are
discussed by Professor A. H.
White, head of the Department of
Chemical Engineering, in the next
of the series of articles on employ-
ment.
Professor White will also in-
clude the results of a survey in
which he asked a number of em-
ployers to state what type of
letter impressed them most favor-
ably.
On Knowing Your Way About
Ann Arbor, population 25,000, four
bookstores. Largetown, population 250,-
000, forty bookstores. Would you be-
bieve it? Of course not. Unless Large-
town has a college or two, probably the
only bookstore it ever had went to the
wall in 1933. You know something
about bookstores and where to look for
them. Why not be equally acute about
some of the simpler, more accessible
factors that will affect your job-finding
problem? Two states have equal areas,
equal populations. Therefore, equal
engineering opportunity? Certainly not.
That depends on industrial develop-
ment. Some simple measures of states,
their development, their share in na-
tional income, can be found in the
World Almanac. Or you might borrow
the most recent national membership
list for your professional society, to
count up the proportion of national
membership represented by a state or
region in which you wish to locate.
Why? Isn't it fair to assume that
roughly, engineering opportunity is in
proportion to the degree in which a
city's engineers are found in your so-
ciety?
Often your line of preference will lead
you to special questions not answerable
by those who are convenient to your
personal approach. If you wish to work
at improving leather processing, you
have to know where the leather business
is. McRae's Blue Book is a register of
American industry. There is undoubt-
edly a national leather association,
anxious to answer letters. You pay
taxes to support bureaus in Washing-
ton that know the answers to such
questions. Use the privilege. The Polk
people publish a guide to Detroit's busi-
ness and industry. You can buy a copy
for fifty dollars, or you can walk into
a hotel in Detroit and use free of charge
the copy that is chained to the desk.
In the job conference with E. E.
seniors last year, the seniors were asked
to name some companies they had
thought of tackling. About ten compan-
ies—all large—were rapidly nominated.
I had with me a January trade journal
which was filled with annual survey re-
ports. One such listed about thirty
leading manufacturers, and showed
whether they had made or lost money
in the preceding two years. Eight of the
ten companies named had lost money.
A number of firms that had already
climbed out of the red were not men-
tioned. There are about six hundred
electrical manufacturing companies in
the United States. Why do great num-
bers of electrical graduates concentrate
their attention on the few? And isn't
it too bad, when at a given time, energy
directed towards getting into these few
may be almost entirely wasted?
While this article was being written,
Mr. Clifford A. Faust of Transit Jour-
nal, and vice-president of Eta Kappa
Nu Association, dropped in. He has
been in charge of the association's place-
ment work in New York. In a large
share of cases in which unemployed
engineers came to him, he found they
had religiously hounded eight or ten
companies, and had cultivated few, if
any other contacts. A survey disclosed
the fact that several hundred New York
firms were employing one or more elec-
trical engineers. These were the firms
where the job hunters were finally
placed.
The Bulletin Board
In order to make a point later on, the
bulletin board should be mentioned. In
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


board is made to serve a variety of edu-
cational functions. Routine matters are,
of course, posted there. In addition, a
rather continuous parade of items is
run throughout the year. Many of the
features described in these articles are
presented in one form or another. The
senior is given plenty of opportunity to
inform himself as to what is expected of
him in participating in our particular
placement scheme. When a significant
book appears, such as that by Lester
(mentioned in the first article), sales-
minded seniors are urged to read it.
About halfway through the year, the
bulletin board announces—
The Job Conference
This annual event is mainly for
seniors of the electrical department.
Starting at 7:30 P.M., with about 70
men present, it ends at 11:00 because
we have to go home sometime. It is
an open forum, devoted entirely to
rapid-fire questions and answers about
the very things these articles are trying
to cover. Should one return for grad-
uate work? Should he do so right away,
or get some experience first? Does a
rolling stone gather any moss, or any-
thing else? What of the large company
versus the small? What about these
training programs? What are present
starting rates? What to do when an
outside offer comes to a man already
employed? These are lengthy matters.
This article has no room for discussing
them. If you want to hear them talked
about, you are welcome to attend the
conference. I will offer to write about
them in future articles, provided a suf-
ficient number of readers will let me
know their wishes. Perhaps you had
better tell the Editor about it at the
same time. It would be up to him, you
know.
Seniors—Live and Otherwise
The live senior will inform himself on
job matters long before his active con-
tacts begin. A large share of the things
he wants to know are common to the
whole senior class. It is out of the
question for any faculty member to
find time to dish out the answers to
individual seniors. Hence bulletin board
service. Hence job conferences. And
then comes the test. When a senior
drops in along about May and inno-
cently asks some question that reveals
he has not kept himself posted, and
when discussion reveals the fact that
he first heard of the job conference the
day after it was over, we know we are
dealing with a man who has been sound
asleep. If he does not promptly come
to life and catch onto things in a hurry,
we fear he may be in for a series of
disappointment for some time to come.
'Keep In Touch
Soon aften graduating, send a copy
of your personal record back to your
faculty placement officer. As soon as you
get that job, let him know. Get out of
the way, and let him concentrate on
your unemployed classmate. Once a year
or so, drop him a letter, bringing your-
self up to date. (Ask him to file your
letter without bothering to answer it;
maybe, if he has a spare moment, he'll
answer it anyway.) In a few years he
will have a complete file on you. Since
you will be one of the few who really
do this, he will reach for you first when
something nice shows up.
While on one job, if you ever decide
that you want to make a change, you
must be particularly sure to inform
your faculty member about it. He does
not, for several reasons, wish to bother
you with offers in the usual case. He
should and will let you alone when your
present opportunities are as good where
you are as it seems they would be else-
where. Moreover, your company will
properly resent it if we or anyone else
are continually bringing offers to your
attention. Experienced men know that
a good share of a year's productive
effort can be seriously upset, if full
consideration is given to but two or
three good offers a year. When you
really wish to make a change, tell some-
body about it.

A given weight of steam always does
approximately the same amount of work
in doubling its volume by expansion,
regardless of initial conditions. In the
light of this particular application of
the work equation it is not difficult to
see the importance of good condenser
design in modern plant economy. The
expansion of a given weight of steam
from ISO pounds per square inch to 75
pounds per square inch avails no more
work than the expansion of the same
weight of steam from a vacuum of
twenty-six inches of mercury to a
vacuum of twenty-eight inches of mer-
cury. Thus we see that in the latter case
a tenth of an inch of added vacuum
would give as great an economy effect
RICHARD F. COOPER. '36E
as an added pressure drop of 3.75 pounds
per square inch or 7.5 inches of mercury
in the first case. Although high vacuums
are impractical in conjunction with
the operation of reciprocating engines
because of the excessive size of the low
pressure cylinders and the large con-
densation and re-evaporation losses,
they are essential to good turbine opera-
tion where the efficiency depends to a
greater extent on the pressure at the
exhaust than on the high pressure con-
ditions at the steam inlet.
Although there are many different
types of condensers, the surface con-
denser operating on the dry vacuum
principle (using separate condensate and
air pumps) is the commonest type, and
it will be the only one considered here.
The surface condenser can be used in
practically all set ups and is the only
type which can be used for marine pur-
poses where salt water must be used as
the coolant. The advantages of the sur-
face condenser are: it requires less power
for operation than other types; it gives
a high vacuum free from sudden fluctua-
tions; it is reliable in operation; the con-
densate is withdrawn free from air and
impurities and at a high temperature
for boiler feed purposes. The disadvan-
tages are larger space requirement,
greater weight, larger amount of cooling
water required, and cost of cleaning.
Improvements in condenser design in
late years have been phenomenal. Using

fer coefficient (BTU's transferred per
hour, per square foot of cooling surface,
per degree difference in temperature),
condenser efficiency may be said to have
tripled in the last fifteen years. The
performance and construction features
of the world's largest condenser at the
Hudson Avenue Station of the Brooklyn
Edison Company can be taken as a very
good example of modern condenser de-
sign. The turbine exhaust inlet of this
condenser is twenty feet square. The
condensing surface amounts to 101,000
square feet and consists of 14,710 tubes
thirty feet long by seven-eighths of an
inch outside diameter. It operates under
the extremely low ratio of .63 square
feet of condensing surface per kilowatt
of turbine output.
A condenser no longer consists of a
box of tubes with as much cooling sur-
face as possible packed into- the smallest
space regardless of the accessibility or of
the frictional losses entailed in bringing
the steam to the condensing surfaces.
The steam should take the shortest path
possible through the condenser to en-
counter the least amount of flow resist-
ance in order that the drop in vacuum
from the exhaust inlet to the air pump
suction may be reduced to a minimum.
The back pressure against which the
turbine operates is the pressure at the
exhaust inlet of the condenser and not
the pressure in the lower parts of the
condenser. In modern condensers the
tubes are arranged to form definite
steam lanes. The advantages of steam
lanes are: good steam distribution at
uniform velocity to all the effective cool-
ing surface, prevention of stagnation of
air at any point, minimization of fric-
tional drop through the condenser. The
performance of an older type condenser
may be actually improved by removing
some of the cooling surface and forming
paths for steam flow.
Air is a very poor conductor of heat,
and it should be removed from the con-
denser as rapidly as possible. Good steam
distribution prevents the air from stag-
nating in any part of the condenser and
blanketing off part of the cooling surface.
The coefficient of heat transfer drops to
as low as three for tubes blanketed by
air. The condenser is filled with an air
vapor mixture, and, according to Dai-
ton's law of partial pressures, the total
pressure is equal to the sum of the pres-
sures of each of the gases that make up
the mixture. At a point in the condenser
where the temperature is low, the vapor
pressure is also low and a greater part
of the total pressure is air pressure. For
this reason the air suction is always
taken at the coldest point, to take ad-
vantage of the increased air density
there. Modern condensers all have an
air cooler section formed by a baffle
plate extending over a portion of the
tubes. The baffle plate is often made of
two thicknesses with a dead air space
between to minimize heat transfer from
the steam side to the air side. The mix-
ture of air and vapor pass under the
lower edge of the baffle and then up-
wards through the cooler tubes to the
dry suction outlet.
The method of arranging for the flow
and removal of the condensate has a
great effect on the efficiency of the con-
denser. The tubes are most efficient when
they are just damp, but the wetter they
become the greater the drop in heat
transfer rate and the heat transfer rate
becomes very low when the tubes are
flooded by the condensate. A careful ar-
rangement of drain plates is made in all
modern condensers to prevent the mois-
ture condensed on the upper tubes from
dripping onto the lower tubes and reduc-
ing their effectiveness. In this way the
temperature of the condensate remains
higher because it is removed with as
little contact with the cooling surface as
possible after condensation has occurred.
An ideal to strive for in the design of
condensers is to remove the condensate
to the hot well at a temperature as close
to that corresponding to the condenser
pressure as possible. This can be accom-
plished by directing some of the exhaust
steam over the surface of the condensate
in the condensate well. This steam lane
is sometimes made venturi shaped to
convert part of the velocity energy of
the steam into pressure, thus raising its
temperature slightly and allowing the

condensate to be withdrawn at a tem-
perature even greater than that which
corresponds to the condenser pressure.
Circulating water should pass through
the condenser with the least possible
amount of friction and it should take up
the maximum amount of heat. Friction
is reduced by properly designed water
boxes and the use of rolled tubes and
rounded entrance ferrules. If the velocity
of flow through the tubes is below the
critical velocity, stream line flow is at-
tained and the portion of the water next
to the tube walls becomes hot and the
column in the center remains cold. It is
essential that the water move with a
velocity above the critical velocity in
order to have turbulent flow and to
bring all of the water into contact with
the tube walls. According to the con-
census of opinion of prominent con-
denser designers, the coefficient of heat
transfer varies approximately as the
square root of the velocity. The gain re-
sulting from high velocities is offset,
however, by the increased cost of pump-
ing.
The modern condenser gives very
good efficiencies for the following
reasons:
The steam is uniformly distributed
over the cooling surface with a minimum
drop in pressure through the condenser.
Air is rapidly removed from the heat
transmitting surfaces, collected at suit-
able points and cooled to a low tempera-
ture for its removal at its minimum
volume.
Condensate is rapidly removed from
the tube surfaces, collected in the con-
densate well and delivered for boiler
feed at the highest possible temperature.
The cooling water passes through the
condenser with the least amount of fric-
tion and the maximum amount of heat
absorption.

Cornice Lighting in a Modern Restaurant
Lighting from luminous panels in the
sidewalls and ceiling of a room, recently
popularized by architects, has made it
possible to achieve greater beauty and
decorative value than possible before
with the hanging fixture type of lighting.
With this new form of architectural
lighting the architect has been able to
satisfy his clients' desire for something
different and something more beautiful
in room decoration. By including the
lighting as an integral part of the decora-
tive scheme many new and pleasing ef-
fects have been produced. This novelty
in lighting has readily been approved by
the public and is due for an ever in-
creasing use in the future.
The purpose of any lighting installa-
tion is to produce light to aid the eye in
seeing. In ordinary room lighting the
density of light falling on the floor or
working plane should be fairly uniform.
Inspections and tests on many built-in
lighting installations have shown this to
be far from true. This point was brought
out quite conclusively by Higbie and
Bychinsky in the March 1934 Trans-
actions of the Illuminating Engineering
Society, pages 206-223. This lack of a
uniformity in the distribution of light
flux on the working plane in most instal-
lations shows that there is a great need
for scientific as well as architectural de-
sign of built-in lighting.
By means of scientific design of built-
in lighting, electrical power can be econ-
omized with more efficient installations.
In designing for a more uniform distri-
bution of light flux on the working plane,
the required minimum illumination can
be met and all values of illumination
above that value can be reduced to as
close to the minimum as practicable, or
as permitted by good artistic design.
The eye does not receive additional aid
in seeing, above values of illumination
of about twenty foot-candles, in propor-
tion to the additional amount of energy
required to produce the light. Hence, by
keeping all values of illumination at the
various points in a room as close to the
required minimum value as possible, a
saving of electrical energy will result.
This saving alone would justify engi-
neering design of architectural lighting,
but there is also an additional gain. A
more uniform distribution of illumina-
tion would decrease the wide range of
brightness now present in most built-in
lighting installations, and cause less eye
strain or fatigue to people in the room.
Because of the enormous possibilities
and advantages found in better lighting,
a study was made recently of the scien-
tific design of cornices for built-in light-
ing. It was undertaken to add to the
small amount of knowledge available to
aid the designer of architectural lighting.
A continuous luminous panel in the cor-
nice of a room, uniformly bright from all
points of view, was selected for study
not only because of its popularity with
architects, but also because analysis had
already shown it to be more likely to
produce excellent illumniation than other
arrangements of luminous panels (See
Higbie's Lighting Calculations, pages
189-191). Of the various types of built-
in lighting this seemed to promise the
nearest approach to a uniform distribu-
tion of illumination on a horizontal
working plane.
By use of theoretical formulae and a
protractor developed by H. H. Higbie
and his associates at the University of
Michigan, the illumination from the uni-
formly bright panels was calculated at
a series of equally spaced points on a
working plane, parallel to, and two and
one-half feet above, the floor. These
values of illumination were calculated
only for direct light flux from the lumin-
ous surfaces and do not include reflected
light; they are likely, therefore, to b?
exceeded in practice, other things being
equal. By varying the slope of the lum-
inous panel to the sidewall and also the
size of the room many different condi-
tions were studied. Three different sizes
of rooms were used, a 24' x 24' x 15'
room, a 36' x 36' x IS' room, and a 48'
x 48' x 15' room. The ceiling height was
kept constant at 15 feet. For each room
size a variety of slopes of the luminous
panel was used so that the best slope for
each room size could be determined.
From the values of illumination cal-
culated at equally spaced points on the
working plane, it was possible to deter-
mine which slope of panel for each room
size will give the best distribution of
light flux and the highest value of aver-
age illumination. Four important consid-
erations in judging a lighting design, in
which glare and shadows have been
made unobjectionable, are: minimum il-
lumination, average illumination, ratio
of minimum to maximum, and percent-
age of floor area with less than average
illumination. These four factors are used
to decide which slope of panel for each
size of room will give the best illumina-
tion distribution and highest value of
average illumination. The average il-
lumination in the room can easily be
found from the calculated values in the
tables, by assuming that the value at the
midpoint of each unit square is the aver-
age illumination for that square. The
minimum and maximum values of illum-
ination can be read approximately from
the tables, and the value of the ratio of
DECEMBER, 1935


be easily calculated. The per cent of the
floor area with an illumination below the
average value can be found with suffici-
ent accuracy by computing what per
cent of the squares in one quarter of the
room have a value of illumination less
than the general average for that quar-
ter.
These four criteria of a lighting de-
sign were plotted as ordinates of curves,
whose abscissas were the various slopes
of panels used as measured from the
sidewalls. These curves were plotted in
groups, one for each of the three sizes of
room. For the best design the values
of minimum and average illumination
should be as high as possible. To insure
the best uniformity of distribution of
light flux on the working plane, the ratio
of minimum illumination to maximum
illumination should be as high as possible
while the portion of floor area having an
illumination below the average value
should be 50 per cent. From the curves
it was easily seen that for each of the
three different sizes of rooms used in the
calculations one slope of panel satisfied
all four of the above requirements. This
slope of panel was 60 degrees for the
24' x 24' x IS' room, 45 degrees for the
"U 1.6 tO 2.4 t6 *l 16
Ratio of Length of Room to Ceiling Height
36' x 36' x 15' room, and 35 degrees for
the 48' x 48'x 15' room.
It was conclusively shown that, for
each of three chosen proportions of room
dimensions, there is a definite slope of
uniformly bright luminous panel to the
side wall which will give the highest
value of average illumination, and at the
same time the best distribution of il-
lumination. Since the ceiling height was
kept constant and the brightness of the
luminous panels adjusted in every case
to give the same amount of light flux
entering each room per unit area of floor
space, it is possible to correlate the data
into one curve. The ordinate used for
this curve is the slope of panel that will
give the best distribution of illumination
and the highest average illumination. To
make the curve more general the abscissa
used is the ratio of the length of the side
of the room to the ceiling height. With
this curve it is possible to determine the
proper slope of the luminous panel for
any given size of square room.
Corniced lighting has proved very ef-
fective in relieving eye strain, in bringing
about greater efficiency and in actually
producing something new, different and
more decorative in lighting effects. A re-
juvenation in the field of illumination
is destined to make all lighting more
economical and more "modern" in all
respects.
Modern drama is so closely allied to
present day life that no one can afford
to be unaware of the fine work in this
field of literature. The modern drama-
tist does not always give as much at-
tention to entertainment as did the
Seventeenth and Eighteenth Century
dramatists, but he is more serious in his
interpretation of life. The modern author
is apt to be more interested in his treat-
ment of life than in his art. The artistic
factor is important but mere craftsman-
ship is not sufficient. The modern drama
is most frequently a brilliant satire,
social in a very intense manner. On ac-
count of the aesthetic unity of thought
and art, the engineering student ought
to be acquainted with this field of litera-
ture.
The modern dramatist is a poet, a
philosopher, a psychologist, a sociologist,
and a creative artist. The varied ap-
proach to human nature, the many inter-
esting phases of human conduct, the
ant

many puzzling questions of ethics, and
the good entertainment to be found in
the drama of today make dramatic lit-
erature an exceedingly worthwhile field.
By the use of good dialogue, there is a
close kinship of author and reader
established, which makes for perfect
understanding, be it in the study or in
the theater. Here we find ideas cleverly
presented in a narrative style and in an
entertaining manner. The good dramatist
always tells a good story well, but it was
not until the latter part of the last cen-
tury that the story was directly related
to our lives.
Henrick Ibsen put life into the old
dramatic mold for all moderns. His
realistic plays awakened a new dramatic
world. It was in the early nineties that
the English world was first influenced by
his work. It immediately changed the
course of action in the works of Pinero,
Jones and Shaw. No writer escaped the
influence of the great Norwegian drama-
list. The dominant idea of his social
plays is the problem of the day. The
conflict of the individual and social in-
stitutions seems to be an eternal prob-
lem. Every modern dramatist has been
interested in the individual right to live
his own life. Every day sees new agencies
created to supervise our lives. It was
Ibsen's firm belief that the individual
must be free to choose his own course
of action if happiness was to be a part of
life. Ibsen's universal art is well illus-
trated in his group of social plays. The
Pillars of Society might well be called
the first and The Lady from the Sea the
last play in this group. However, despite
the social emphasis, Ibsen kept the
theater in mind by creating powerful,
emotional roles in every play for the
interpreters of his work. Those who have
imitated him have not always been as
successful as he. His work created a new
world of acting and a new theater.
It was this new dramatic world that

tunity. His brilliant satires on contem-
porary prejudices, his interesting ideas
on all questions, will interest every
reader. Arms and the Man, Candida,
Major Barbara, and Man and Super-
man are only a few of the many plays
every reader should know. Ideas are
dominant. Shaw arouses his readers to
think by ridiculing almost everything
the average man holds sacred. He is the
enemy of all that is romantic.
With the rise of the drama, John Gals-
worthy turned from the novel to new
fame in the theater. He is ever the
serious minded Englishman, who paints
life as it is with a skill and sincerity
rarely equalled in this age. I believe that
the ironic force of Galsworthy's pen has
not been surpassed in modern literature.
One is always aware of forces far greater
than man, but never is man released
from individual responsibility. The in-
justice of man-made institutions and con-
ventions is revealed with an un-mistak-
able clearness. In his work, we find the
touch of an artist, who has combined an
idea, character study, and a story. One
is very much aware of his sincerity in
reading Strife, The Pigeon, The Silver
Box, and Escape.
In the revolt against the rigid struc-
ture of the old well-made plot, Haupt-
mann and Chekhov were among the
leaders for change. The structural aspect
of the drama was greatly modified; the
movement which was called naturalistic
came into being. The aim of this group
was to portray things as they are by
eliminating the artificial plot structure
of the old form of drama. Hauptmann in
The Weavers gave the world an interest-
ing experiment. It is simply a series of
pictures, five in number. It is a graphic
description of the relationship of Capital
and Labor. In The Cherry Orchard,
Chekhov gives us a purely naturalistic
drama. It is the story of an interesting
Russian family, pure character study,
without any climaxes or any obvious
conflict, and with no false, emotional
crisis. The question arises, can the drama
succeed in the theater without a plot?
The naturalistic play seems to be with-
out form or structure, but it throbs with
life in every line. It is a play of rare
texture, appreciated only by the true
lover of art.
But it is in the expressionistic group
of dramatists that we find the greatest
departure from the old dramatic world.
The movement was a distinct revolt
against content and form. It is in Strind-
berg's work that one first finds definite
evidence of this new movement. He has
influenced many young dramatists who
are writing today. One of the outstanding
characteristics of the movement is the
emphasis placed upon the subjective
portrayal of character. The inner man
is revealed. The writer is intensely in-
terested in the sub-conscious thought of
man, which may or may not be trans-
lated into action. The fantastic concep-
tions of the expressionistic author de-
mands a very imaginative reader or
audience.
The theme is frequently abstract and
plays an important part in the drama.
The author's ideas are more important
than his characterization. We are com-
pelled to think if we are to understand.
The dramatist is intent upon revealing
that which has never been revealed be-
fore. No subject, no idea, no aspect of
life, hitherto overlooked, is omitted for
treatment by this group. The impression
of futility or pessimism is usually con-
veyed to the reader or hearer. The
characters are generally the abnormal
or the exceptional type, the type the
middle class does not know.
In regard to form, there is absolute
freedom. The author may express his
mood, the moment, the idea; he may
express these in a one act play, in seven
scenes, in three acts, in nine acts, or in
fourteen acts. O'Neill has revived the
use of the mask and the aside to accom-
plish his purpose. The adaptation of the
form to the subject matter is most in-
teresting.
It was Strindberg who first combined
the new forces in his great play, The
Father. In it, one of the theater's most
powerful plays, we see the disintegration
of a man's mind. The action of the play
is developed by revealing the mental
struggle of a man and his wife, the type
of conflict which is very representative
of the expressionistic writer. Strindberg
had a remarkable power of analysis of
the inner forces of character. The duel
of the sexes was his most important
theme. Some of his well known dramas
are: To Damascus, The Dance of Death,
The Dream Play, and The Bridal Crown.
His daring and sensational naturalism in
technique and content have had a tre-
mendous influence upon present day
dramatists.
Among the American writers, none has
been influenced by Strindberg more than
Eugene O'Neill, our most important
dramatist. Many of O'Neill's dramas
deal with sex, a forbidden theme in
America until recently. It is always a
force that brings disintegration and de-
gradation to his characters. Here again,
it is the inner man that is revealed, the
conflict within that destroys soul and
body. O'Neill gives us many new char-
acters. The very simple mind or the
abnormal and exceptional type are pre-
sented with unusual dramatic power.
These furnish excellent theatrical ma-
terial and exciting reading. One must
read The Hairy Ape, The Strange Inter-
lude, and Mourning Becomes Electra to
appreciate and understand his art.
There are many other dramatists
whose work ought to be presented, but
we can merely mention a few. Some of
these are: Maugham, Molnar, Capek,
Wedekind, Toller, Kaiser, Pirandello,
Andreyev, Synge, and Rice. Every
reader should be familiar with some of
these and thus broaden his knowledge
of human nature.
WHAT, NO
HANDBOOKS?
"Don't depend upon your handbooks,
because the new engineer must know his
'stuff'." This was one of the warnings
given by Professor D. H. Young in a
recent classroom digression from the
subject of dynamics.
"The old and so-called practical engi-
neer is going to die professionally, and
die hard," he continued. "Old grads who
demand recognition on the strength ex-
perience alone had better look out. En-
gineering has progressed to such a de-
gree that wasteful experimentation can
now be replaced by concrete knowledge.
In the future you are not going to make
your way by the people you know (at
least not to such a great extent) but
rather by the engineering you know. In-
dustry used to send representatives to
colleges, and if you could get through
those interviews without stuttering or
blinking, you usually got the job—but
no more. The scene has changed. Com-
panies now write to individuals in the
University for information which will
not deceive them as far as the technical
worth of the student is concerned. We
now have in the University a number of
men sent back to college by their em-
ployers, with pay, to obtain more
knowledge.
DECEMBER, 1935


MANY CASTINGS USED ON
SAN FRANCISCO BRIDGE
Man is continually thwarting nature
as he strides to a better and greater civ-
ilization. The San Francisco Bridge was
conceived because there existed an un-
surpassable barrier to vehicular and rail-
road traffic between San Francisco and
Oakland—namely, five and one-half
miles of deep salt water. Much work has
been done already under the general
supervision of C. H. Purcell. The bridge
is double decked, with two suspension
bridges from San Francisco to Yesta
Island (distance of two miles) and a
cantilever construction from Oakland to
One of the caissons has been sunk a
the Island (three and one-half miles),
distance of 235 feet—a world' record
for depth of piers. The amount of con-
crete and steel incorporated in the struc-
ture is equivalent to that used in all the
large office buildings in San Francisco.
69,000 miles of wire, 200,000 tons of
steel and cables, 2,000 tons of steel cast-
ings, 200 tons of iron castings and 50
tons of phosphor bronze castings are
employed. Needless to mention, these
castings must be of mammoth size to
possess the herculean strength required.
ooo
METALLIC HEAT INSULATION
The use of metal sheets arranged
with a definite stagnant air space be-
tween them has recently attracted con-
siderable attention as heat insulators.
At first it was believed that only bright
metals would reflect satisfactorily the
radiant energy (the chief method of
heat transfer at low temperatures).
However, later research and testing
has proved that hot rolled and annealed
steel sheets are equally good reflectors
of such long wave lengths as prevail at
room temperature. By placing ice in-
side a metallic insulated ice box and by
keeping the room at constant tempera-
ture, the rate at which the ice melts is
an index to the coefficient of heat trans-
fer of the arrangement. Several designs
were tested and gave coefficients as low
and lower than commercial insulation
now used. Steel insulated refrigerator
cabinets for domestic use have been
built and are now undergoing service
tests.
ooo
WHAT IS SHOT WELDING?
The advent of stainless steel stream-
lined trains, stainless steel frameworks
of airplanes and automobile trucks, and
many other stainless steel constructions
heralded also the appearance of shot-
welding. In welding stainless steels
great care must be taken to prevent
burning the material. Since burning may
occur at 600 degrees F, this operation
is delicate and not capable of being
done manually. However, because stain-
less steel is especially adapted to spot
welding due to its high resistance and
clean surfaces, the process of shot-
welding was developed, which is merely
controlled spot-welding. An automatic
control fixes the current and voltage
used in welding so that the material is
not injured, yet an extremely strong
fabrication is produced. A recording sys-
tem tells whether too much, too little,
or just enough fusion has resulted.
-ooo-
CAR WHEELS FROM SCRAP
The first chilled iron car wheel made
from all scrap was produced in 1923—
and was a failure. Although it was con-
tended to be an impossible task, enter-
prising foundrymen soon turned out
wheels made from all scrap that gave
a better drop and thermal test than
wheels from virgin pig iron. The diffi-
culty was that not enough free carbon
was present so that strains were set up
by fast cooling. Hot melting to get more
carbon, hot shaking and hot pitting to
give a high annealing temperature
paved the way to a high class wheel.
Furthermore impurities were not appre-
ciably increased by using scrap.
Chilled iron car wheels in order to
compete with the lighter alloys must
be slenderized, hence the iron must be
made stronger. Perhaps malleableization
and a higher melting temperature will
lead the way.

SKRINK-PROOF WOOD RESULTS
FROM NEW WAXING PROCESS
The Forest Products Laboratory has
announced the development of a wax-
ing treatment for wood that protects it
from warping, shrinking, and from other
ravages of moisture. A wood sealed with
wax will remain "new" for many years
—all the while preserving its natural
finish. New possibilities and a better
working material are now at the dis-
posal of craftsmen.
The system, developed by Dr. Stamm.
is superior to other waxing methods be-
cause the wood is treated intermedi-
ately with "Cellosolve" injected by a
process which displaces the moisture.
The wood, impregnated with cellosolve,
is placed in a melted wax bath and the
cellosolve is replaced and distilled off.
Older methods did not use this inter-
mediate step; hence the moisture was
incompletely removed, giving only a
partial protection against warping and
shrinking. The new process does not
impair the seasoning of green wood.

THE MICHICAN TECHNIC


CHIEF ENGINEER
Fred M. Zeder, Vice Chairman of the
Board and Chief Engineer of Chrysler
Corporation, was graduated from the
University of Michigan in 1909 and was
vice president of the senior engineering
class. Like many other successful engi-
neers, he began his technical career be-
fore entering college. During high school
vacation periods he worked as an ap-
Fred M. Zeder
prentice in the machinist trade at Bay
City's Industrial Works, and after he
had graduated from high school he was
employed for a time in the Motor Power
and Trains Division of the Michigan
Central Railroad. In 1905 he entered the
College of Engineering here and worked
his way through. Upon graduating he
entered into the apprentice course of the
Allis-Chalmers Co. of Milwaukee and be-
came Erecting Engineer of that firm a
year later.
From 1910 until 1913 he had charge
of the laboratories of the E.M.F. Co.
From 1913 to 1920 he was with Stude-
baker Corp., serving as consulting engi-
neer and later as chief engineer. During
this time he was responsible for the de-
signing of the Studebaker Six and Big
Six cars. In 1920 he became associated
with Mr. Walter P. Chrysler who was
then with Willys. A year later Mr.
Zeder organized and became president of
Zeder-Skelton-Breer Engineering Co., a
consulting firm which was responsible
for the designing of the original Chrysler
"70."
When the Chrysler Corporation was
organized, Mr. Zeder became vice presi-
dent in charge of engineering in the new
firm. At the present time he has charge
of the engineering activities of the entire
Chrysler Corporation. He has been re-
sponsible for the engineering of motor
cars, trucks and commercial cars, busses
and motor coaches, marine and indus-
trial engines, air compressors, and air-
conditioning equipment.
In 1932 Mr. Zeder conceived and
founded the Chrysler Institute of Engi-
neering. He received the honorary degree
of Master of Engineering from the Uni-
versity of Michigan in 1933.
In addition to his engineering activi-
ties, Fred Zeder is a member of the Uni-
versity of Michigan Club of Detroit, In-
tercollegiate Club of Detroit, American
Society of Mechanical Engineers, So-
ciety of Automotive Engineers, Amer-
ican Society for Testing Materials,
Franklin Institute, Tau Beta Pi, and
Sigma Xi.
WITH THE NEW GRADS
December is a restful month. Stu-
dents are day-dreaming through the lull
between the termination of the foot-
ball season and the approaching Christ-
mas holidays. Children are flattening
their noses against shop windows, and
older people are looking upon the world
in general with the annual holiday-sea-
son benevolence. Professors are assign-
ing those famous pre-vacation blue-
books; meanwhile their pupils groan and
think enviously of the alumni who are
beyond the reach of the long arm of the
inquisition.

SENIOR PRESIDENT
A staunch Re-
publican from
California is our
Senior Class
president, Bob
Merrill. Besides
his important
class office, Bob
is vice president
of the Engineer-
ing Council,
secretary of
/ulcans, and a member of the executive
:ommittee of the Interfraternity Coun-
:il. He is also president of his fraternity,
-'hi Gamma Delta and a member of Tau
3eta Pi.
Matriculating in September, 1932,
Bob entered the Lit School expecting to
najor in chemistry. After a semester in
he Lit School, he decided that Chem
Engineering was more suited to his needs
ind transferred to the Engineering Col-
ege. Being athletically inclined, Bob
vent out for football and wrestling as a
reshman, earning his numerals in the
atter. He has remained on the wrestling
iquad for his entire four years.
In the class games held in 1933, Mer-
•ill was elected as the sophomore captain,
^is growing popularity found him a
jlace on the Soph Prom committee that
same year. Bob also was a tryout on
.he staff of the TECHNIC during his
'reshman year. As a sophomore and
unior he held a position on the advertis-
ng staff and was also Accounts Man-
iger for a time. Triangles, junior honor-
iry society, elected Merrill into member-
ship at the end of his sophomore year.
Bob was elected, in his junior year, to
he Engineering Council and last spring
vas elected vice president of that group.
\s president of the senior class Bob re-
signed his Council office but is still a
•nember ex-officio. There is no doubt
ibout his scholastic ability as evidenced
-&gt;y his membership in Tau Beta Pi. Last
spring when the students sponsored the
Dpen House, Merrill was placed in
:harge of the exhibit of the Engineering
Drawing department. The job was done
ji a commendable manner, as is every-
:hing which Bob undertakes.
BUSH HOPPER
From St. Clair, Michigan, comes Nel-
son Droulard, senior engineer prominent
in student activities, athletics and schol-
arship, and a sailing enthusiast. His fel-
low Braves in the tribe of Michigamua
have appropriately named him "Bush
Hopper" for he is a "top-notch" pole
vaulter on the track team. Michigamua
is not, however, the only honorary so-
ciety that has recognized his outstand-
ing abilities. In the Engineering College
both Vulcans and Triangles have ac-
knowledged his prominence in extra-
curricular activities.
In his Sophomore year "Kels" became
a member of the Engineering Honor
Council. In his Junior year he was
elected president of the class of '36 and
in this capacity served on the Engineer-
ing Council. At
present he is a
^^^•p^^ member of the
Men's Council.
Activities
alone are not
enough to keep
Mr. Droulard
busy—he is also
working his
way through
school. At pres-
ent he is assist-
ant to Professor Emswiler. To defray the
expenses of an education he has done all
sorts of work from manual labor to
playing a saxophone in a dance band.
Last summer "Nels" had a job running
boiler tests in the Marysville Power
Plant of the Detroit Edison Company.
In spite of all his varied activities and
outside work Droulard finds time to take
twenty hours a semester and manages to
be an A-l student. Last fall he was one
of two Juniors elected to Tau Beta Pi.
He is now vice-president of that society.
Recently "Nels" was initiated into Phi
Kappa Phi. Last spring he received a
Donovan Scholarship and the Athletic
Award given to the letterman who at-
tains the highest scholastic average.
Truly a well rounded man is one who
can excel in athletics, in class and
campus affairs and in scholarship while
earning his way through school.
PILOT
With more than 1,000 hours flying
time to his credit, Francis L. Wallace,
senior Aero, is learning the Aeronautical
Engineering field from both ends at the
same time. Fran, born in Iowa, is a resi-
dent of Freeport, Illinois, and a graduate
of the high school there. He entered Cor-
nell College in Iowa, but transferred to
Michigan in the spring of 1934. Al-
though he is only in his fourth semester
on the campus, Wallace has entered into
the general activities of the college and
already achieved a record that is to be
envied.
With the organization of the Aero
Branch of the A.S.M.E., Fran was ap-
pointed publicity director, and last
spring the society elected him as its
representative on the Engineering Coun-
cil. When the Council planned the Open
House last spring, Wallace was the logi-
cal choice for Publicity Director. Shortly
following this, he was elected to the office
of President of the Engineering Council.
In this capacity, Fran was chairman of
the Engineering Ball held recently, the
first ever held on the campus. A large
share of the success of this dance is di-
rectly due to Wallace as he has succeeded
in placing the Engineering Council di-
rectly behind a well-known campus
event. Wallace is also vice president of
Chi Phi, his fraternity, and a member of
the senior class cap and gown committee.
Fran has been flying planes since 1928
and has held a Transport Pilot's license
for two and a half years. In the early
part of last summer he spent his time
instructing student flyers in Freeport.
Later he had the job of flying a private
plane for a business executive. During
this time Fran flew over 15,000 miles in
a Stinson cabin plane with all modern
equipment for
night and blind
flying.
Because of
the thorough-
ness with which
he undertakes
his work, we
have no fears
for his future in
aviation. An en-
gineer and pilot
combination is not found every day.

IT IS A PRIVILEGE
But there are some people in the engi-
* neering college who seem to think that
they have a perfect right to "use" the
T" libraries and all that is in them in any
p- way and at any time. We wish to make it
5 clear to these people that the University
its tuition fee does not include the cost of
:• books and supplies.
"Every year there are a number of
'• books which disappear without record
. from the Engineering Libraries and the
'Department of Engineering English.
I Some students and perhaps even a few
i members of the faculty apparently "for-
t get" that these books are University
'• property. The Engineering Libraries at-
tempt to stock their shelves with com-
I plete and up-to-date information, and it
is yours and everyone else's privilege to
make use of this service. But it is also
your business to see that the privilege is
not abused. It is exasperating and dis-
couraging, to say the least, when a per-
son is looking for an important reference
to find that it is "missing from the li-
brary." Why need some people be so
selfish at the expense of others? Indi-
vidual cooperation is the only remedy
for this unfortunate situation, so please
do your part. Librarians have enough to
do without adding police duties.
Right here in Ann Arbor fraternities
and rooming-houses there is undoubtedly
a number of library and department
books that have not been charged out.
Will you show your cooperation by re-
turning these books? Probably you are
not the one who is responsible for their
having left the libraries, but it is quite
possible that you and a few thousand
others may have occasion to refer to
them some time. The libraries make no
charge on any such books returned.
The University desires to maintain a
complete library for the use of all stu-
dents and faculty members, but it can-
not afford to supply private libraries to
even a few people.
NICS MAILBOX
We're disappointed. We thought you
would have some suggestions, or at least
tell us what you thought of the magazine.
So far, Nic's Mailbox, located on ths
second floor bulletin board in the Arch,
has yielded one solitary communication.
This is supposed to be your magazine so
we are trying our best to give you a
voice in the administration of its policies
and practices. You apparently are not
interested. As it is now, this publication
represents the ideas of only the imme-
diate staff, which is about one per cent
of the total engineering student body.
We will leave Nic's Mailbox on the bul-
letin board until the beginning of Christ-
mas vacation, and it will be there to use.
CURRENT NEWS
One-half of the enclosed TECHNIC
bulletin board on the second floor of
the Arch will hereafter be devoted to
current news and notices concerning the
professional societies of the Engineering
College. In the past it has been a policy
of the TECHNIC to print each month a
brief account of society meetings and ac-
tivities of the preceding month, but be-
cause of the lapse of time before the
actual appearance of the printed ac-
counts, they lost a large amount of their
news value. It is in an effort to give you
up-to-date service that we are resorting
to this new method of presenting news
from the technical societies. Watch the
TECHNIC bulletin board.
FANCY SLIDE RULES
One of our 1935 graduates is working
for a concern which evidently has em-
ployed Michigan men before. He relates
the following incident which occurred
during his first week on the job:
"The boss had given me an assignment
which required some simple calculations.
Happening to have my good old Log Log
Duplex with me, I set to work. I had just
gotten well under way when one of the
senior engineers came along, and stop-
ping at my elbow said, 'Well, look at the
fancy slide rule—Michigan man, eh?'
After assuring him that I was, he added,
'I wish they would teach you fellows
down there how to do some good prac-
tical estimating (referring to cost esti-
mation in construction work) instead of
so many fancy tricks on those slide rules.
I had a Michigan fellow here once who
never did learn to estimate until I put
him on a construction job where he had
to produce the goods within his own cost
figures. That boy learned that it takes
more than boards and nails to build a
box'."
What do you think? Was the senior
engineer just "talking through his hat,''
or are there too many fancy slide rules
and not enough practical and common
sense training in our engineering educa-
tion?
TO THE FACULTY
One of our faculty members was
heard to say recently that he definitely
favored large classes because they
created a sense of responsibility in the
instructor which the smaller classes did
not. He said that there is a greater tend-
ency for an instructor to slip up occa-
sionally in his preparation when the class
is small than when it is large. For that
reason a student in a large class has the
advantage of a consistent high quality
of instruction.
However, may we call attention to the
situation confronting the student in a
large class and in a small class. We may
again compare the two on the basis of
responsibility and find that there is
usually a much greater sense of responsi-
bility by the student to the instructor in
the small class than in the large one. In
a large class the student may not be
held for a recitation more than once or
twice a semester. There will be a ten-
dency for him to shirk or postpone the
daily assignments, and he will fail to
respond fully to the teachings of the in-
structor, no matter how excellently pre-
pared.
The situation might be viewed from
the standpoint of efficiency. Is it more
efficient in the learning process to culti-
vate responsibility in the student or in
the instructor? It is our opinion that the
cultivation and stimulus of responsibility
in the student is most important and
presents the most serious problem.

TRANSIT
SLANTS
Fellow sufferers: Christmas again, with attendant infla-
tion of the spirits and deflation of the pocketbook. Home
we trundle to faithful and unfaithful girl friends. Ah, the
sweet joy of going home a big shot—and watching your
girl chase around with some spook that was just a measley
soph when you left the portals of your high school alma
mummy. Ah, yes, Christmas is a time of cheer, in keeping
with which I give you a cheerful little ditty to be sung to
that good old dirge, St. Joe's Infirmary.
The Ballad of Little |oc
Little Joe stood in the Health Service,
Oh, close to dead was he,
But he had to wait for hours and hours
\Vaitin' like you and me.
After while the nurse says, "Yer next,"
And Little Joe went through the door,
"Oh," the Doc says, "you look tough,"
As Little Joe fell to the floor.
They picked him up so careful,
And they listened to his heart,
It was thumpin' like a big bass drum,
Then it stopped—and didn't start.
So now you've heard my story,
Of Little Joe's sad, sad fate,
So stay away from that Health Service,
Or with death you've got a date.
One 1939er was observed brushing the hayseed out of
his hair, in a manner of speaking, and our curiosity being
aroused we approached him. "How've you been?" we quer-
ied, knocking him lightly to the floor.
"To New Yawk," he comes back, snappy-like as we wipes
our feet on the seat of his pants. We didn't quite follow
his line of thought, but just to keep the conversational
ball rolling, we asked him how business was in them thar
parts. Chewing thoughtfully on our one good ear he medi-
tated for a while, then finally he said, "Well I'll tell you.
It seemed awfully dead-like to me. I stood fer four hours
in that thar place they call Times Square and never saw
a load of hay."
AGE OF SPECIALIZATION—Fair Maid: "Oh, sir, what kind
of an officer are you?"
Officer: "I'm a naval surgeon."
Fair Maid: "My goodness! How you doctors do special-
ize!"
Life of an Engineer
I '11 sing to you a story
Of an Engineer so true,
He came from good old Michigan,
His colors, Maize and Blue.
They finished him up at college,
Out into the world went he,
And all he owned was a slide rule
Just the same as you and me.
Now first he worked on bridges,
A sweepin' up the street,
And the mayor, he admitted
That he did it mighty neat.
Then he quit and went to buildings
And a janitor soon was he,
He'd shovel coal like a good 'un
When they needed heat in 20C.
From this he went to chemical,
But washing bottles was a chore,
He'd work and sweat on a sticky mess
\Vith acid all over the floor.
Then came a call from good old naval
So he worked on a ship or two,
The other guy held the caulkings
While he beat it a dull tattoo.
Then next he went electrical,
With volts he thought he'd play,
So he got him a job a stringin' poles
From Rangoon to Mandalay.
His urge for travel got him
And an aero soon was he,
He'd fold up little parachutes,
To save both you and me.
Well this job finally got him
And there he was to stay,
Till he had to demonstrate one,
Which opened—not that day.
Now that concludes my story,
A sad one, yeah, but true.
As an Engineer he lived—and died,
Who's next—me or you?
Freshman: "Say, what's the idea of wearing my rain-
coat?"
Sophomore: "It's raining and you wouldn't want your
best suit to get wet, would you?"

FAR above the clouds, on all the leading airlines, your pilot is always within hearing
and speaking distance of airports—via Western Electric radio telephone. 5 This
equipment, made by the manufacturing unit of the Bell System, is helping the airlines to
set a notable record for fast, safe transportation. Teletype—another Bell System service
—speeds printed weather information to airports. Long Distance and local telephone
facilities, too, play important parts in airline operations. 5 Bell System services reach
out in many directions to the benefit of industry and commerce.
You can "fly" home by telephone, in a couple of minutes. Why

Think?
Question: To strengthen America's social and
economic foundation a series of nation-wide
power sources to furnish low cost energy to all
parts of the nation has been suggested. Is it
practical and possible?
Answer: by A. H. Lovell, Professor of
Electric Power Engineering
I wonder whether our social founda-
tion can ever be stronger than it was
under the "rugged individualism" of the
pioneer family. Contrary to the implica-
tion in the question, our well-being is
not prejudiced because we cook our
meals with gas and heat our homes with
oil or coal rather than use electric energy
for these tasks, so long as personal pref-
erences and plain economic analysis of
the costs of these services justify their
use. However, life can certainly be made
easier and our production capacity can
be increased by the presence of abundant
and readily adaptable power for light-
ing, heating, cooking, refrigerating, in-
dustrial work, radio, time service, etc.
For America with its vast distances
for distribution and its variety of fuel
and water power supply, cheap energy
does not necessitate any one national
type of service but rather the selection
of the most economic supply for each
particular community. Certain regions
have good coals favorable for cheap
steam plants; some sections have abund-
ant oil fields with small communities,
making ideal conditions for efficient
Diesel and oil engine plants; and other
sections have magnificent hydro sites
favoring hydro-electric developments.
Even in the last case power engineers
now favor the building of the hydro
plants as complementary sources of
power to operate in conjunction with
steam plants, in order that the hydro
installed capacity will be greater in pro-
portion to the available stream flow and
that an increased energy output can
be utilized.
Our steam plants of the past seven
years have brought their thermal effici-
ency markedly forward from perhaps
16,000 B.t.u. to around 12,300 B.t.u.
per net kw.-hr. of plant send-out at a
production cost of 3 to 4 mils. The com-
bined mercury vapor-steam cycle plants
have approached 10,000 B.t.u. These
plants can generally be located within
reasonable distances from their load
centers with moderate charges for trans-
mission lines necessary to join power
station and distribution system. In
adopting the question's nation-wide
system of hydro-electric developments
the power sites are frequently several
hundreds of miles from large load
centers, thus incurring a heavy "trans-
mission liability" over and above that
necessary for a steam-electric plant.
With transmission costs of the order of
1 mil per kw.-hr. per 100 miles to be
added to the hydro station costs, it is
apparent that at 200 or 300 miles from
the hydro site the steam plant can com-
pete at the same delivered cost and fur-
nish a guarantee of better service. If,
however, the transmission line is part of
a planned interconnection network, then
part of its cost may be allocated to that
phase of system planning.
Fortunately for the element of variety
in engineering problems then, no one
type of power seems to be a general so-
lution, but each time an increment of
power capacity is needed for a region,
the designer must analyse and compare
all the available sources of power,
whether hydro, steam or some other
kind.

second in the
National A.A.U.
breaststroke com-
petition.
As a sophomore
Jack started things
by swimming the
200-yard breast
stroke in 2:26.6 at
Iowa, breaking all
existing records
for this event. The
same evening he swam in the 300-yard
medley relay, with Michigan winning in
2:59 for another world's record. These
records were made in a short or 20-yard
pool.
In the Harvard pool last spring, Jack
annexed the National Intercollegiate
breast stroke championship to add to his
Big Ten championship in the same event.
During the past summer, Kasley was a

THE MICHICAN TECHNIC


On the installation shown above, the contractor fabricated
by oxy-acetylene cutting and welding the bends, reducers,
and other specials in his shop and installed them with
tie-in welds on the job. The lines and bends were in-
stalled with a proximity which would have been im-
possible by other methods of joining. The insulation
contractor estimated a 30 per cent saving on insulation
labor because it was a welded installation.
OXWELDED PIPING SYSTEMS
. . . are easier to install
and cheaper to maintain
• The economy of oxy-acetylene welded piping for power or
domestic and industrial heating purposes extends all along the
line. Oxwelded piping systems are cheaper and easier to install,
and, once installed they are leakproof and lasting. There are no
maintenance expenses on a system put in by this modern process.
Let Linde Help You
The Linde organization can help you with your welded piping
projects from the first blue prints to the finish of the actual
installation. Linde customers benefit from the closely coordinated
research, development and field engineering facilities of the Linde

AUTHORITY
Stephen Timoshenko began his Amer-
ican career as a research and consulting
engineer with Westinghouse in 1923.
As Professor of Engineering Mechanics
he has been a member of Michigan's
faculty since 1927 and is recognized
throughout the world as an authority in
his field.
His technical training is a product of
Stephen Timoshenko
old Russia, having graduated from the
Institute of Ways and Communications
at St. Petersburg in 1901. The same year
he was made an instructor of math-
ematics there. He became a full-fledged
professor in 1906 at the Polytechnic In-
stitute of Kiev. From 1919 to 1922 he
was to be found teaching at the Poly-
technic Institute of Zagreb, Jugoslavia.
In his native Russia he held such posi-
tions as consulting engineer for the Navy
Yard and technical councilman of the
aircraft division of the War Department.
He also served on a special committee
for stresses in railroad track. In this
country he has worked for the Vibration
Specialty Company of Philadelphia and
he is still consulting engineer for West-
inghouse.
Last spring the National Advisory
Committee for Aeronautics named him
on a committee of eight outstanding engi-
neers to investigate and report on the
suitability of lighter-than-air craft in
United States Government work. The
Applied Mechanics division of the A.S.-
M.E. claim him as a member of their
executive committee. A new book by
Timoshenko, The Theory of Elastic Sta-
bility, has just gone to press supplement-
ing his widely-quoted Theory oj Elas-
ticity and Strength oj Materials. This
spring Professor Timoshenko plans a
sojourn to Europe for the purpose of at-
tending an international conference on
bridges and another on mathematics.
ENGINEERS AT
THE POLLS
The increasing din over the coming
1936 Presidential election subsided to
a whisper last month as the campus in-
dulged in one of its favorite pastimes—
the election of class officers. The most
desirable political prizes, the dance
chairmanships, were in the Engineering
College this year and so unusual activity
was beheld on all sides.
The Chem-Electrical ticket, organized
and headed by Bob Merrill, swamped an
unnamed opposing party, with a total of
72 votes cast. Besides Merrill, president,
there were Rupert Bell, vice-president:
Sheldon Drennan, secretary; Howard
Jackson, treasurer; and Robert Warner,
Engineering Council.
Tor Nordenson, Theta Xi, was ap-
pointed Senior Ball Chairman by Presi-
dent Merrill, who also named Larry
David and Harold Clayton as commit-
teemen.
The Juniors turned out in great
fashion. Aided by "Hiram" Walker's
Home-to-Poll service, the United Engi-
neers won six out of nine offices. Ben
Cox, Phi Psi, was selected J-Hop Chair-
man, but the Consolidated ticket fur-
nished the two committeemen, Don Hil-
lier, '37 soph prexy, and Carl Abbott.
Other United men who won out were
Miller Sherwood, president; Ced Sweet.
vice president; Bill Sheehan, secretary;
Jack Kasley, treasurer; and Bert Coffey.
Honor Council. Bill Lowell, Consoli-
dated, won the position on the Engineer-
ing Council. The Junior class cast a total
of 205 votes.
The sophomores had no election at
all. The candidates, who were unopposed
and therefore elected, were: Fletcher
Platt, president; John Young, vice-presi-
dent; Dick Wangelin, secretary; Carl
Clement, treasurer; and Goff Smith.
Honor Council representative.

EXPERIENCED
MEN OF 28
Social security legislation is casting its
shadow before it, American Association
of Engineers Employment Department
says. The 40 year deadline which has
claimed the solicitous attention of the
Association for many years is no longer
the 40-year deadline—it has dropped to
32 and is trying to reach 28. The larger
firms in filling the new technical posi-
tions that are opening up demand men
of 28 and refuse to consider applicants
over 32. Anticipating old age and retire-
ment pensions and other social provis-
ions that are likely to be mandatory,
industry plans to catch them young. The
complicating condition is a demand for
"experienced" men of 28. Ten years ago
that might have been possible. Graduat-
ing from a technical school at 24, a man
would normally have had four years of
engineering experience at 28. But the
classes of 1930, 1931, 1932, 1933, and
1934, have for the most part learned a
lot about selling hosiery or aluminum, or
have had their closest contact with engi-
neering in CCC camps or surfacing roads
with the PWA or CWA. For four years a
small portion of the technical graduates
have been absorbed by the engineering
profession. Experienced engineers of 28
are members of the class called "avis
rara." With a staggering list of unem-
ployed men in its file of applicants, good
men, graduates of the best schools and
experienced, A.A.E. Employment De-
partment has found it impossible to fill
demands from industry for men under
32 with adequate experience to be placed
in responsible charge of engineering
work.
Another serious situation confronting
industry is unmistakably indicated in
A.A.E.'s contact with workers and em-
ployers; skilled workers of all kinds will
be hard to find when production be-
comes normal. The signs are unmistak-
able in the contacts which A.A.E. Em-
ployment Department has both with in-
dustry and with workers. Unemploy-
ment, intermittent labor at unrelated
jobs, and psychological factors growing
out of these conditions have produced
in the hordes of men wanting jobs only
a small proportion of the disciplined and
skilled workers that came from the ranks
through routine training into fitness for
skilled jobs.

THE MIRACLE MAN
There was a desert of alkali
When the Miracle Man came 'round
And cast a sort of hasty eye
On the barren and parching ground;
Then he made some lines and some figures strange
And summoned his slaves—and, lo,
The waters came down from the mountain range
And the desert began to grow!
He plants the sod
With his magic rod
Which he squints through a tube to scan,
With a gleaming chain
Over hill and plain
Goes the modern Miracle Man.
There was a river that rose in flood
With terrible rage each Spring,
Drowning its hundreds and spreading mud
And ruin on everything,
Till the Miracle Man with pencil made
Some figures hieroglyphic,
And now the river is calm and staid,
A pattern of streams pacific!
For the floods that rave
Must all behave
And peacefully wear their gyves,
They must cease to rage
And earn a living wage
When the Miracle Man arrives!
There was a pass too steep to scale,
An Isthmus too tough to cut,
A swamp too boggy to hold a rail;
Said the Miracle Man, "Tut! Tut!"
He made some jottings, he called his crew—
There's a highway through the pass,
And ships are sailing the Isthmus through,
And trains ride the soft morass!
Through the wizard art
Of a pale blue chart
These miracles did appear,
For the Miracle Man
On the Modern Plan
Is known as the Engineer!

FOR PROFESSOR BOSTON
At the November meeting of the Board of Regents, Pro-
fessor O. W. Boston, Director of the Department of Metal
Processing, was granted sabbatical leave for the second
semester of the school year 1935-1936.
Professor Boston and his family expect to spend the first
few months getting acquainted with the country's southern
playground. They first will motor to New Orleans, after
which they expect to devote some time to Professor Boston's
hobby, deep-sea fishing in Florida waters.
He will visit the United States Navy Mine Depot in
Yorktown, the headquarters of the Marine mining opera-
tions in which Professor Boston, as Lieutenant Boston,
U.S.N., was engaged during the World War. Some time will
be spent in renewing acquaintances in Washington, D. C.,
where the Bostons lived during the War. He expects to de-
vote some time to some experimental work being conducted
at the Naval Gun Factory and the Bureau of Standards in
Washington, D. C.
Throughout the trip it is Professor Boston's intention to
visit various schools and research laboratories where ex-
periments in metal cutting and development work in machine
tools is being carried on. Also some time will be devoted to
the editing of various standards on small tools and machine
tool elements for the American Standards Association.
WELDING AUTOMOBILES
The automobile, once fastened with screws, nuts, rivets,
nails and solder, is becoming largely a product of the welder.
3,415 welds, with the number steadily increasing, was the
latest count at the Ford Motor Company. At the Rouge
plant 5,000 welding operations are carried on, five standard
types of welds used, and over 1,000 welding torches and
600 welding machines employed. One of the most spectacu-
lar operations is the rear body assembly which is welded
by huge "balloon" flash welding machines. The panels are
placed in position, and when the operator presses a button
the machine closes, welding 72 inches in 7 seconds. Weld-
ing is labor saving, permits greater strength with less weight,
and is done automatically and uniformly.
SENIOR GETS RESEARCH GRANT
Karl Kaiser, senior Mechanical, has received a grant of
five hundred dollars from the Faculty Research Committee
for the investigation of certain milling problems. Karl's
work is a continuation of two A.S.M.E. papers by Pro-
fessors Boston and Kraus on the elements of milling. This
theoretical study is being followed by practical tests on a
milling machine, which is here on consignment from the
Cincinnati Milling Machine Company. This machine, valued
at $6,500, was originally borrowed for a period of one year,
but will probably be extended for a second period. Karl is
measuring the forces and power required to operate this
machine. The three components of force are measured on
mechanical dynamometers, while the power used is measured
by a watt-meter. These results will enable designers to
estimate power, size and forces on a milling machine to be
built for any particular need.

IN INDUSTRY
Reporting to the Annual Meeting of
the American Association of Engineers
held in Chicago, November 4, 5, and 6,
the manager of the A.A.E. Employment
Department declares that the engineer's
own attitude of mind is the big hurdle
now in the path of his rehabilitation in
industry.
There is a perceptible reluctance on
the part of professional engineers to re-
enter private industry. A.A.E. Employ-
ment Department attributes this to a
conviction among technical men that the
turnover in industry is more rapid than
in government projects. Whether it be
true or not, this widespread belief among
engineers is creating an actual shortage.
The intermittent operation of plants has
made engineering employment a matter
of tenure for the duration of the job.
Large engineering firms have maintained
a skeleton organization, employing
skilled technical men as they were
needed for specific operations. This
policy, entirely in harmony with other
economies, is responsible for the marked
preference that some of the better engi-
neers show for government jobs. Many
applicants, when interviewed, frankly
avow a preference for private industry;
admit that the industrial job in question
offers greater salary inducement; but
reluctantly cling to a government job as
affording a better chance of long time
employment. Directors, connected with
both public and private enterprise in the
East, the West, and the Middle West,
confirm the findings of the Employment
service maintained at headquarters.
Engineers are still afraid of the inter-
mittency of industry and of the brief
tenure of such jobs.

A.S.M.E. ROAST
On Wednesday, December 18, the

engineers and members of the Engineer-
ing Faculty are invited to attend. A
fine dinner and lively program are
planned.
SUBMARINE MINING
Since 1882, Vancouver Island, Brit-
ish Columbia, has practised submarine
mining, an operation that was developed
because of the great demand for coal
at that time. Over 4,000 acres of coal
fields beneath the bottom of the sea
have been mined, and production is
still in progress after fifty-one years of
continuous output. 1,500 tons are pro-
duced every working day. The total in-
flow of water into the 4,000 acres of
submarine workings is only 1,200 gal-
lons per minute.
The greatest hazard in the mine be-
neath the sea is spontaneous fire. If
the roof caves before all the coal is ex-
tracted the great pressure on the coal
with the oxygen present causes uncon-
trolled combustion. Sealing off the pil-
lar is the only means of extinguishing it. ooo

The Normandie has a bulbous bow, but it does not follow that all modern ships
should have them. The bulbous bow has been investigated in our Naval Tank and
these investigations have shown it to be beneficial under certain speed conditions
but not under all.
The broadside view of the Normandie shows the unique deck arrangement aft,
and gives some idea of the disturbance caused by the passage of such ships through
the water. The stack nearest the stern was added for appearance' sake; it is not con-
nected with the boilers. A portion of the space is used for dog kennels.
The under water shape of the bow and stern has to be chosen carefully to suit
the speed conditions.
All these factors are being investigated continually in our Naval Tank.

EDITORIAL BOUQUET
IT IS very pleasant to have people say nice
things about one. The pleasure is curiously
heightened, however, when the nice things are said
in a roundabout way—never intended directly to
reach one's ears. General Electric recently was
honored in such a manner on the editorial page of
the Spokane, Washington, Chronicle, and the Com-
pany is still basking in the warmth of the glow gen-
erated. The editorial, in part, read as follows:
"An exposition at which inventors of the Pacific
Northwest will display their work will be held next
month in Portland.
"It will probably be a revelation to those who sec it.
Most persons find it hard to think of great men com-
ing from 'near at home.' When one speaks of inven-
tors or scientists, the Northwest citizen thinks of the
General Electric laboratories, or of observatories in
California, or clinics in Vienna. . . ."

CELESTIAL PUSH-BUTTON CONTROL
[EAVENLY bodies a million times fainter than
the faintest star the eve can see unaided will be
brought to the earth for inspection and photography
at the touch of an electric push button when the
McDonald Observatory on Mt. Locke in western
Texas is placed in operation. The observatory build-
ing itself is almost completed, but the technicians
of the Warner and Swascy Company at Cleveland
are "making haste slowly" with the polishing of the
552-inch reflecting mirror. They estimate that
another 12 or 18 months will be needed before the
mirror is ready for installation. The 45 tons of mov-
ing parts of the telescope will be at the command of
a single individual, who will be able to take his stand
upon an observing bridge and virtually order the
stars to parade before him. The motors and complete
electrical control to make this possible have been
manufactured for the builders of the telescope by
General Electric.
VOICES FROM THE SKY
WHEN the Whiteface Memorial Highway—a
road leading to the summit of the 5000-foot
Whiteface mountain in the heart of the Adirondacks
—was dedicated this autumn, voices came down
from the sky on a beam of light. There was nothing
mystical about this performance, however. The beam
of light came ftom a 24-inch G-E searchlight on the
summit of the mountain. The voices were those of
President Franklin Roosevelt and New York's
Governor Herbert Lehman.
President Roosevelt's words, dedicating the high-
way, were carried on the light beam seven miles
from the mountain to the crowd at the Lake Placid
air|&gt;orl. Governor Lehman had spoken over the light
beam the night before. He was so interested that,
after the dedication ceremonies were finished, he
spoke again to demonstrate the equipment to the
members of his family. Both night and day demon-
strations were successful, although once or twice
during the day the words faded to faintness when
small clouds floated by the mountain top and par-
tially obscured the light beam.
Two-way communication was carried on by means
of short-wave radio equipment located at the air-
port. G-E engineers, who made this special installa-
tion, had to transport a gas-driven power plant and
a dozen or more storage batteries to the mountain
top to operate the talking light beam.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


JOB
Professor A. H. WHITE
Head of the Department of Chemical Engineering
In the two preceding articles A. D.
Moore has given a wonderful amount of
valuable advice to seniors in his own
inimitable fashion. He did not say
much about the selection of a mailing
list of prospective employers, and the
preparation of that list is important.
There will occur to every senior the
names of a few large corporations with
whom he might wish to be connected. It
is all right to apply to them, but remem-
ber they probably get letters of applica-
tion by the bushel. Do not overlook the
small plants. Every manufacturer em-
ploying one hundred men could use at
least one engineer who is willing to
make himself useful. There is probably
a power plant with problems connected
with fuel and water. There are ques-
tions of heat insulation, electric installa-
tion, tests of raw materials or manufac-
tured products. A small organization
will not give the engineer the training
which he will obtain with the large cor-
poration, but he will have the opportun-
ity of meeting the bosses at first hand,
and will be able to make his influence
felt in a short time. Such a position
may lead to independent responsibility
much sooner than would be possible
with a larger corporation which employs
many engineers who are senior to the
college graduate just entering employ-
ment.
Consider first what sort of a position
you would like to be holding five years
from now. There are broadly three lines
of promotion:—production or operation,
research and development, and sales.
What industry attracts you? What part
of the country do you prefer to live in?
Does a small town or a large city attract
you? It is well known that fishing is
always better on the other side of the
stream, but give the home town at least
a chance to avail itself of your services.
There are directories of manufacturing
concerns such as Thomas' Book of
Registered Manufacturers. It will pay
the prospective engineer to spend sever-
al hours studying this and making lists
of names which he thinks will be use-
ful to him. In the case of larger cor-
porations, Moody's Manual, which is
kept on the open shelves of the Business
Administration Library, will be helpful.
References as to the financial rating of
all but the smallest company will be
found in Dun and Bradstreet, also in
the Business Administration Library.
I have known seniors who wrote one
letter, and waited to get a reply from
that before writing a second letter to
another firm. It is better to compose a
good letter and send copies to a large
group. The body of the letter may be
identical in all cases but it is desirable,
if possible, to preface the letter with
an individual introduction indicating
why the applicant would like to be con-
nected with that particular company.
One of our seniors graduating in June,
1935, followed this plan, and later gave
me the following memorandum of his
efforts.
Letters of application sent out .. 162
Replies received 104
Requests for Interviews 16
Employers Interviewed 10
Positions Offered 4
Positions Accepted 1
A 1934 graduate sent me a letter
from which I quote the following: "Fol-
lowing up your suggestion that was
made to the fellows getting their degrees
in '34, I went to Moody's Directory and
made a list of those companies that I
thought might require the services of a
chemical engineer. To these I wrote
letters and in answer received several
offers for interviews. One of these re-
sulted in a place with the Koppers Prod-
ucts Company, the by-product subsid-
iary of The Koppers Company. I am
still with the same company.''
In 1932 I wrote to some of my friends
who were employers and asked them to
advise me what type of letter impressed
them most favorably. In compliance
with my request they sent me specimens
of letters which were good and some
which were poor. These letters are in a
file on the Librarian's desk of the East
Engineering Building, and are worthy
of study by those who are about to
make application for positions. I quote
from some of the employers' letters.
The Director of Research from the
Vacuum Oil Company says:
"I may say that in my own practice
of employing men I immediately throw
out the following: (a) Applications in
which there are a number of misspelled
words or bad errors in grammar. An
example of such an application is that
of Mr. A. and to a lesser extent that of
Mr. B. (b) Applications in which the
applicant professes to have special
knowledge of secret processes used by
competitors; also applications in which
the applicant criticizes too much his
previous employers. An example of the
latter is that of Mr. C. (r) Applica-
tions in which the applicant wants defi-
nite promises of advances in pay or
position. In other words, I don't want
a man who is not willing to take a
chance on himself.
"I receive a good many of what I call
'small boy' letters. If these are from
young men still in college, I don't take
it very seriously, but from men who
hold degrees I consider it serious enough
to reject,such applicants. Two samples
of such applications are those of Mr. 1)
and, to a lesser degree, Mr. E."
The Manager of Employment of the
duPont Company expresses his opinion
as follows:
"From my point of view, the first
letter is merely an introduction, and is
not expected to furnish a great deal of
detailed information as this can be de-
veloped later by formal application and
interview. This should state briefly the
desire, the training and experience, if
any, of the applicant and should have
an inexpensive snapshot attached.
"It goes without saying that this
letter should be neatly written or typexl

ruled sheet obviously torn from a note-
book. Attached is a copy of what I
consider a thoroughly satisfactory first
letter of application.
"Inasmuch as the above is my per-
sonal opinion, it might be well to elab-
orate on the attached specimen to the
extent of including references, as it is
quite probable that there are some firms
or individuals who do not use a stand-
ard application form, and consequently
would desire references in the first letter.
"I would advise strongly against the
use of flowery or stilted language savor-
ing of a form letter, or any attempt at
high-pressure salesmanship."
From the B. F. Goodrich Company
comes this comment:
"The greatest difficulty with the ma-
jority of applications is the scantiness of
personal information about the appli-
cant. All formal applications contain
certain specified questions. The mere
answering of these questions will in all
probability not get the man a position.
They are placed in the application for
the purpose of classifying a man as to
race, color, health, physical character-
istics, type of training and experience.
The sections left for remarks and per-
sonal connections are placed in the ap-
plication to give the opportunity for the
applicant to advance reasons why he is
the man to be selected for the position.
In our own case the application is im-
portant because it precedes the personal
interview which we consider highly
essential.
"The writing of an application for a
position is one of the most important
steps in securing a position and should
not be slighted by hurry or oversight.
It gives the applicant a chance to place
himself in the eyes of his prospective
employer with respect to experience,
personal contact, extra-curricular ac-
tivities and ambitions. Surprisingly
enough, many men are chosen or reject-
ed because of small details in their ap-
plication rather than because of the ac-
complishment shown through the attain-
ment of the degree. The application
should be irreproachable as to neatness,
English and legibility. It is a real chance
for the applicant to make an impression
with the employer.1'
Mr. Harvey M. Merker, Superintend-
ent of Parke-Davis and Company, says:
"It is very important that the appli-
cant use good English and proper spell-
ing. Some of the letters we receive are
really a disgrace in this respect. Since
the handwriting of so many people is
illegible, I would recommend that all
letters of application be typewritten, in
first-class style. These letters should
give a complete outline of the studies
and work of the person making applica-
tion. It is also a good idea to send a
snapshot or small photograph of the
applicant. There is no doubt but that a
good letter of application often results
in a personal interview.
"Write in a tone that will give the
impression of self-confidence, without
being 'cocky.' Be courteous, but do
not try to court favor through flowery
phrases. Do not 'beg pardon' for taking
up time with your letter—if the letter is

particular qualifications and train-
ing does it require? What is the

in that field?

cle of this employment series, Mr.

Company, Cleveland, will discuss

too often misunderstood field of
engineering.
any good, its reading will give pleasure;
and the prospective employer will be
glad to have your application on record,
even if there is not a position open at
the moment."
And now for a prize example of the
sort of a letter which should not be
written. This is an authentic letter
written by a senior at the University of
Michigan (not an engineer) to one of
the larger oil companies. The employ-
ment manager sent it to me with the
query as to what sort of nut wrote a
letter like that. I learned he was a
pretty fair student, and apparently
wrote the letter so it would attract at-
tention. He succeeded, but the atten-
tion attracted was not favorable. Here
is his letter:
"Dear Sir:—Because I have in my
possession a protean pliability that is
infinite I am confident of being able to
assume the shape of any but a formless
container and because I am twenty-one
and a college graduate with a super-
abundance of ambition, intelligence and
a sense of humor and more important
because the Fates have conspired to
force me to unearth a position with an
incidental monetary attachment I have
written to you hoping that you will be
able to cut short my search. I remain
patiently and impatiently yours and
with utmost respect until an answer,"
As stated by several of these employ-
ers, the initial letter merely establishes
a basis for a personal interview. If a
request comes for a personal interview
it is wise for the student to learn as
much as he can about the company.
The employer is quite apt to ask him
why he wants to work for that company,
and if this student shows he has taken
enough interest to find out something
about his prospective employer he cre-
ates a more favorable impression than
if he says in effect, "Well, I have to
work for someone, and I suppose you
will do." The applicant should not rely-
only on the letter which he has previous-
ly sent. He should carry with him sev-
eral copies of a single sheet giving his
name, address and qualifications. If
the interviewer does not have his orig-
inal letter at hand this sheet may be
produced and left as a memorandum.
If the first interviewer suggests the stu-
dent see someone else, that is probably
a good sign. He should leave a personnel
sheet with the first interviewer, and ad-
vise him he has another in his pocket
which he will give to the second man.
The applicant who leaves four calling
cards of that sort is less apt to be for-
gotten than the man who leaves one or
none.
In the days of 1929, the engineering
graduate sat still and waited for some-
one to offer him a job. Since that time
the engineer has had to hustle. The
fishing has not always been good, but
the man who kept fishing intelligently
and industriously usually caught some-
thing worth while. The demand for men
is better than it was, but the engineer
must still plan his campaign carefully,
and execute it thoroughly. His engineer-
ing degree gives him the foundation on
which to work, but he must supply the
X element himself.
EDITOR'S NOTE: Because of the many
inquiries received, we wish to announce
that this series of articles on employ-
ment will continue throughout the re-
mainder of the present school year.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


eat
name
by JOHN BEYER. '36E
The coming of the rear engine auto-
mobile, commonly considered an inno-
vation in automobile engineering,
marked the beginning of automobile
history. Early American and English
motor car designers, influenced by the
appearance of the buggy and stage-
coach, never considered anything but
rear engines. The only place to hide
the motor in a vehicle similar to the
early American buggy was under the
rear seat, and with the one and two cyl-
inder horizontal engines of the period,
that location was suitable.
In 1891, Levassor of France brought
out a car which had the engine mounted
in front with the crankshaft parallel to
the frame—the first front engine car.
The change of the engine from rear
to front was a gradual one, although
the Autocar Company departed from
American practice as early as 1892.
The development of the multiple-cylin-
der vertical engine made it impossible
to mount the engine as had been done
previously, and by 1908 the rear engine
was abandoned in the United States.
It may be of interest, before examin-
ing work done in recent years on rear-
engine cars, to find what advantages
are claimed for that design.
It is clear that the rear-engine car
lends itself to stream-line design, which
becomes of more importance as roads
are improved and allowable speeds in-
creased. The demands of streamlining,
as set forth by Sir Denniston Burney,
manager in charge of the construction
of the English dirigible R-100 and de-
signer of several rear-engine automo-
biles, are:
(1) Tapering tail (in one or both
planes).
(2) Highest and broadest portion
toward the front and not more than
one-third of the car length from the
front.
(3) Minimum of projections.
The tapering tail moves the passen-
gers forward to a point between the
axles where maximum riding comfort is
obtained and becomes the logical place
for the mounting of the engine.
In the orthodox car, with its load
about equally distributed on the four
wheels, it is obvious that the greater
part of the load is thrown onto the
front wheels while braking. Tests in
the National Physical Laboratory by
Bradley and Wood show that moving
the engine to the rear reduces stopping
distances. Best results were obtained
with the engine located about one-third
of the length of the wheelbase ahead of
the rear axle.
It is not difficult to see that a rear
engine would increase driving wheel
adhesion, while lower center of gravity
would produce greater stability.
Burney claims increased safety in the
event of a head-on collision with the
rear engine car. A car can be con-
structed to crumple at a predetermined
rate but a motor cannot. His plan is to
allow the crumpling of the automobile
to absorb the shock of impact gradu-
ally. Just what is to prevent the motors
of the cars from striking the passengers
in the back is not made clear.
Difficulties have been encountered in
installing satisfactory controls and in
providing a means of cooling the en-
gine. The rear engine, while aiding rear
wheel adhesion, has given rise to poor
steering qualities with the reduced load
on the front wheels.
Appearance becomes of great im-
portance in any product which must be
sold to the general public. Since it is
feared that the public will object to a
great many radical changes at one
time, many rear engine cars have been
produced which sacrifice the advan-
tages of streamlining to obtain a more
conventional appearance.
A wave of interest in rear-engined
automobiles was started at Berlin in
1921, when Dr. Rumpler displayed his
''tear-drop" car. The streamline body
had the shape of a motor boat and had
no top. A rear mounted, six cylinder
engine made up of three banks of two
cylinders each was direct connected
to the transmission and rear axle drive.
Rumpler claimed greater stability on
turns for his design, but the vehicle
was never placed on production.
At the Paris auto show of 1927, M.
Claveau exhibited a car shaped like
the airfoil of a wing. It was driven by
a four cylinder, opposed horizontal en-
gine mounted between the rear seat
and the rear axle. After two more years
spent in the development of this type
automobile, Claveau decided against its
feasibility. He said that too much space

engine automobile—

difficulties were too great, and it was
hard to provide room for baggage.
Sir Denniston Burney, after experi-
menting with several rear-engine cars
produced a streamline automobile with
a 148-inch wheelbase driven by a rear-
mounted, eight cylinder in line engine.
The engine was contained in a hood
which projected slightly from the slop-
ing tail of the car. A-false hood similar
to that of the conventional motorcar
served as a baggage compartment. For
cooling, a radiator was placed at each
end of the car. Water circulated
through the radiators in series (front to
rear) through two pipes running the
length of the body.
While various men have experiment-
ed with the rear-engine motor car, few
have been successful from a commercial
point of view. It may be of interest
to see what cars of this type have
actually been placed on the market.
About 1931, the Trojan automobile
was placed on sale in England. It was
a small car of conventional body form.
The power plant was a four cylinder
engine mounted transversely in what
appeared to be a rear trunk. Power was
transmitted through a chain to a
sprocket on the rear axle.
Two small, rear engine cars were
placed in production in Europe early in
1934. The Hansa-Lloyd and Goliath
Works of Bremen brought out a car
(94-inch wheelbase) of orthodox body-
design driven by a two-cylinder, rear-
mounted engine. The motor was cooled
by two blowers on the crankshaft and
was contained fully within the body
lines. Within a year, production on this
model was stopped.
Dailmer Benz brought a small, rear-
engine Mercedes (98-inch wheelbase)
the frame of which consisted of a large
tube. The motor was placed behind the
rear axle on a fork extending from the
end of the tube. The body was par-
tially streamlined with a hood extend-
ing rearward from the downswept roof
at the back. A dummy hood at the
front provided room for a spare wheel
and tool box. Air for cooling the en-
gine was drawn through louvres in the
body panels above the rear fenders.
Eight months later, Benz produced a
similar car with the motor placed ahead
of the axle to improve steering quali-
ties. The new model apparently met
with greater success than did its prede-
cessor.
Because the rear-engine automobile
did not prove to be a solution for all
motor car difficulties as was first ex-
pected, its development has been re-
tarded. A few none too successful
attempts at producing such a car have
placed it in disfavor. Nevertheless, two
or three concerns are engaged in experi-
mental work on rear-engine vehicles,
and perhaps they will produce some-
thing of value. The problem is an in-
teresting one from an engineering view-
point.
The Black Ball Ferry M. S. Kala-
kala gave Puget Sound, Washington,
the first completely streamlined ship
operated anywhere on the seven seas.
The new vessel went into operation in
July between Seattle and Bremerton,
home of the Puget Sound Xavy Yard
and gateway to Hood Canal and the
Olympic Peninsula.
"Kalakala" (pronounced Kah-lok'-
ah-lah) was taken from Chinook, the
intertribal language of the Northwest
Indians; it means "Flying Bird.'' And
this ferry looks like a flying bird. A
flying bridge on either side of the wheel-
house gives the appearance of modified
wings, and the low, tapering stern
accentuates the illusion.
The Kalakala was built for the Puget
Sound Navigation Company at the
plant of the Lake Washington Ship
Yards. She is 276 feet long, she has a
beam of 55 feet 8 inches and a draft of
13 feet, and her capacity is 2,000
passengers and 110 automobiles. She is
97:?4 per cent steel—a construction al-
most as unusual as the appearance.
Even the wheelhouse is nonmagnetic
steel; previous wheelhouses have al-
ways been wood. The new construc-
tion is a big factor in the elimination
of the fire hazard, and that hazard was
given unusual consideration. The ship
is equipped throughout with a new de-
sign of fire-fighting apparatus unlike
anything used heretofore on shipboard.
The superstructure is completely
welded by a special electric method
which gives great strength and elimin-
ates unsightly rivet heads and over-
lapping plates. Five tons of welding rod
were used in the ship's construction.
The Kalakala is propelled by a
Busch-Sulzer Diesel engine which de-
velops 3,000 horsepower at 230 rpm.
The auxiliary generating unit is a 600-
horsepower Busch-Sulzer Diesel engine
direct connected to a General Electric
generator rated 500 kva with a 10-kilo-
watt, chain-driven exciter. This gen-
erator furnishes power for the various
engine-room auxiliaries, such as blow-
ers, compressors, pumps, etc., as well as
for the galley and lights.
There are other motors for various
duties with an aggregate of over 100
horsepower. All the motors are standard
industrial motors not equipped with
moisture-proof windings, marine fittings,
nor drip-proof covers. This interesting
selection was made by the engineers
based on experience gained from the
operation of other ferries.
THE MICHICAN TECHNIC


CAPTAIN
When the iron
men of Mich-
igan's 1935 ice
hockey team
wrested the Big
Ten champion-
ship from Min-
nesota last sea-
son, they elected
a Minnesota boy
to captain the 1936 Wolverine team.
Thus Lawrence David, four-letter man
from Hibbing. Minnesota, took the En-
gineering College higher up in the realm
of varsity sports. But the desire for the
cold was first realized by Larry when he
was born in Russia in 1914. At the age
of six weeks he was bundled off to the
United States so the Russians could go
to war.
When the hockey season is over and
the warm spring breezes blow across
the campus, Larry discards his hockey
. stick for a golf club and goes to work
on Old Man Par at the University
course. Larry's two letters in golf show
that Par has met his match. Putting all
of his letters together, plus the two we
assume he will earn this year, Larry will
graduate with a nice rosy total of six.
A six-letter man in the Engine School is
as rare as a prof who doesn't give finals.
To add to his golfing laurels, Larry
entered the Northwest Amateur Golf
match three years ago and won the title,
which he has successfully defended the
last two years. Speedboating is another
hobby in which Larry excels, and in
1933 he won the Class C event at the
Arrowhead Open Meet.
But Larry doesn't confine all of his
activity to athletics alone. At present
he is a member of the Senior Ball com-
mittee and a member of Sigma N'u fra-
ternity. His ability was recognized by
the braves of Michigamua and Larry is
now a member of the Tribe. His new
title is "Staunch Haunch" and very ap-
propriate if we do say so. Larry David
has chosen Mechanical Engineering as
the profession he intends to follow, and
we are sure that he will be able to suc-
ceed by applying the same energy he
has displayed here in school.
SOCIALITE
Presenting Charles Marschner, senior,
Vulcan, wrestler, senior class representa-
tive to the Engineering Council, former
J-Hop committeeman, Pennsylvanian,
D.U., and good fellow. Chuck spent the
last summer boondoggling for the Penn-
sylvania State Civil Relief Board and
was glad to get back to school for a
rest.
Having mastered the art of wrestling
in prep school, Marschner came to Ann
Arbor and earned his numerals on the
freshman squad. He did not continue
in intercollegiate competition but pre-
ferred to wrestle in the fraternity
matches. At the present time he is Fra-
ternity champion in the 165 Ib. class.
Aside from his accomplishment in
athletics, Chuck has received his share
of political bouquets resulting from his
work in this field. During his sopho-
more year he was ap-
pointed to the Finance
Committee of his class.
Last year, when the
junior class elections
^-y were over, Chuck was
B~ M the proud holder of a
fll committee position on
the J-Hop, social season
highlight. This year, Marschner repre-
sents the senior class on the Engineering
Council, replacing Bob Merrill, who re-
signed upon receiving the class presi-
dency. His activity won him a niche in
Vulcans, where he takes a great delight
in talking politics at the round table dis-
cussions on Sunday evenings.
Although an Aero engineer, Chuck
confined his interests to the construc-
tion and flying of model planes until
this year. Now he is a member of the
Glider Club, learning to master the
details of that hazardous sport. With
such a well-rounded list of achieve-
ments, it would be hard to keep this
gentleman from succeeding, so we'll just
assume that much.
MANAGER
Only one of the many try-outs for
the business staff of the Daily can ever
become Business Manager. Five years
ago George Atherton started out as a
try-out for the Daily staff, and today
he is Business Manager. The reason
George is still here is because he was
out of school for one year while obtain-
ing a first-hand view of the world in
general. At the end of his sophomore
year, Atherton got a job on a ship that
was making a trip around the world,
so he didn't return to the campus until
the fall of 1934.
George started out in Ann Arbor
in the fall of 1931 and did quite a bit of
intensive studying. At the end of the
first semester he was eligible for and
elected to Phi Eta Sigma. During this
same year he began his work on the
Daily. In the summer George has had
to work to assure himself of another
year here at Michigan, where he is
studying math. These jobs have ranged
from plumber's assistant to electrical
laboratory assistant.
On his return in 1934 George was
elected to Triangles, honorary society
for junior engineers. The following
spring Atherton was chosen as a brave
in the Tribe of Michigamua for his ac-
complishments here on the campus. As
a result of the splendid scholarship rec-
ord made through his first three years,
George was also elected to Tau Beta Pi,
honorary scholastic engineering society.
The initiation paper for Tau Beta Pi,
written by Atherton, was published in
the May, 1935 issue of the MICHIGAN
TECHNIC.
Benefiting from his varied experiences
on the campus and several summers en-
gaged in work-
ing, we feel quite

Transport Pilot No. 25789
Ever since man "conquered" the air,
weather has placed many obstacles in
the path of the unrestricted operation
of his aircraft. In the early stages of
aviation, it was necessary for an aviator
to wait for days at a time so that the
wind would not be too strong for his
flimsy craft. When aviational develop-
ment made wind effects negligible,
weather in more severe forms still hin-
dered the aviator. Gradually he over-
came the greater part of these handi-
caps, until he was confronted with the
problem of sight. With the development
of instrument and radio flying, man has
conquered the last of the natural handi-
caps, and flying in unfavorable weather
has become merely a matter of skill in
piloting.

Turn and Bank Indicator
The first experimenters, in what was
then called blind flying, worked in cloud
formations high above the ground.
They found that after flying a moment
through these clouds, their airplane was
likely to emerge on anything but an
even keel. The sense of balance func-
tioned, but it gave the pilot an errone-
ous impression as to the attitude of his
airplane. He might even be upside down
and not be aware of it. This was very
disconcerting, for it had been thought
that a man flew entirely by the "seat
of his pants," and therefore, he should
be able to fly even though he could not
see. It was soon admitted that the pilot
would have to supplant his sense of bal-
ance with instruments which would un-
erringly indicate the position of the air-
plane.
It was then that the
development work on
instruments for blind
^ flying was started.
In blind flying it
|^ was necessary to know
three things concerning
the relative motion of
the airplane. First, are
the wings level; second,
is it flying a straight
path; and, third, is it
climbing or losing alti-
tude? To satisfy the
first necessity, a ball,
contained in a curved
glass tube, acts as a
level. For a second,
a small gyroscope,
mounted on its axes of
rotation,registers a
turn. The gyroscope
and the level are incorporated in a single
instrument, called the turn and bank in-
dicator. For the third necessity, the rate
of climb indicator, devised to register
a rate of change of air pressure, indi-
cates the rate of climb or descent. Then,
to aid the pilot in the use of these in-
struments, the airspeed indicator is
added to the group. These are the three
basic instruments to be used in what
we shall now call "instrument flying,"
since the term "blind flying" is errone-
ous in that the pilot is no longer blind,
but has his instruments to indicate the
attitude of his airplane. The above
named are the only flight instruments
which the pilot may use in the test for
his Scheduled Air Transport Rating.
Now that the pilot has these three
instruments, he must learn to use them.
Instrument flying is a matter of watch-
ing the instruments, and when they
show the airplane deviating from level
or straight flight, correct it. Easy, you
say? Less than two minutes under a
hooded cockpit will convince you other-
wise. Those same erroneous "seat of the
pants" impressions which caused the
earlier pilots to get in many awkward
positions are still present, and are no
simple matter to overlook, since the in-
struments and the sense of balance will
not agree. The pilot must learn to do as
the instruments say, but after trusting
his sense of balance for so long, it is
impossible to disregard it at once.
Harold Stark, veteran air mail pilot,
devised a system of flying with these
instruments which is used by most pi-
lots, called the "1-2-3-" system. In
using this system, the pilot must do
three things, (1) center the flag of the
8

ter the ball with the ailerons, (3) bring
the rate of climb indicator to zero with
the elevators. Despite the simplicity
of this method, a pilot requires several
hours practice to become proficient.
Next, the pilot learns to do turns with
his instruments. The turn indicator not
only tells the pilot that he is turning,
but also the rate at which he is turning.
Therefore, to make a perfect turn, he
need only hold the flag of the turn in-
dicator in a certain position and keep
the ball centered. Since the magnetic
compass does not act quickly enough,
turns must be timed in order to stop at
a definite point.
The final stage for the average pilot
is to learn normal climbs, glides, and
spirals. These are merely an application
of straight flying and turning, but the
coordination of the engine, rate of climb
CHICA6Q Cfilier
indicator, and the airspeed indicator is
essential.
Xow that you understand the prin-
ciples of instrument flying, let us take
a routine training flight with a compe-
tent instructor in the front cockpit. He
will do the take-off and landing, bring
the ship back to an even keel, and look
out for other airplanes. After you get
in the ship, the hood is fastened in posi-
tion. Your instructor takes off while you
sit there and watch the instruments, for
you are going to fly the airplane your-
self before long.
Soon the ship reaches the altitude at
which the instructor is to turn it over
to you, heading south. The stick shakes
in your hand. You are in control of the
airplane. It is not an especially bumpy
day, but slight bumps throw the ship
off its course and the flag of the turn
indicator ships a little toward the "L,"
indicating a left turn. Remembering
your instructions, you ap-
ply right rudder, and the
flag returns to center. By
this time, the ball has
fallen over to the left, but
right stick brings it to
center again. The rate of
climb is pointing to the
downward side, but slight
back pressure on the stick
corrects that. Well now,
you say, this isn't bad, so
you sit back and relax a
bit. While watching the
instruments, you notice
the flag hanging slightly
to one side and push
opposite rudder, but it
doesn't seem to come back
right away. The ship
doesn't feel as though it
were turning to you, so since you are
not convinced that it is turning, you
won't push the rudder hard enough. You
sit there perfectly content the airplane
feels just as it always did, but notice the
flag is a little further off to the left and
the compass is no longer reading south.
You decide that it is time to do some-
thing about it, so you kick right rudder
to center the flag, and immediately
you feel something is wrong. The ball
bounces over to the left. You are certain
the ship is level, but you apply right
aileron against your better judgment.
While this is going on, the motor seems
to be racing, and you look over at the
rate of climb indicator. It is reading
1200 feet per minute, down! You pull
back on the stick to correct that, and
are pushed down hard in the seat. The
ball slides off to the left and the flag is
again back there. You try to correct
everything, but are too mixed up to do
any good. Did you say this instrument
flying was easy?
About this time, your instructor takes
the ship over, and you feel it going
through as smooth a half-roll as ever
you have done yourself. You zip back
the hood to see if your instructor has
put the ship on its back, but the ship
is level and flying straight! Surprised?
Your instructor tells you through the
headphones that you were in a left
power spiral, losing altitude and gain-
ing speed very rapidly. Your sense of
balance told you that you were flying
level, so when your instructor righted
the ship, you went through all the sensa-
tions of a half-roll in the same direction

as the recovery. By that time you real-
ize you must do as the instruments sig-
nify and waste no time in doing it.
Your instructor sets you off again,
and you make a secret bargain with
yourself and your sense of balance. You
will let your sense of balance go wher-
ever it chooses, but you are going to
see that your hands and feet do as the
instruments say they should. With that,
you get along fairly well with yourself
and airplane, and after a few hours
practice, are able to fly straight and
execute precision turns.
You can now fly by instrument, but
still lack one thing, the ability to fly to
some definite destination and locate it
accurately without seeing it. To aid in
this work, the U.S. Department of Com-
merce is now operating some 140 Radio
Range Stations. Each radio range
marks four ranges, or courses, which are
normally 90° apart, but they are usually
shifted about to suit the requirements
of the particular airway. These rang?
beacons are effective at a distance of
approximately 100 miles from the sta-
tion, and are generally located in the
vicinity of a terminal airport or an inter-
mediate landing field, making their hom-
ing features useful to the pilot.
In flying the range, the pilot tunes his
radio to one particular range which oper-
ates on the course which he intends to
fly. If he hears a steady signal through
his headphones, he is on one of the
courses which will lead him toward or
away from the station to which he is
listening. If he hears a dot-dash (A),
or a dash-dot (N), he is to one side or

I
the other of his course, depending upon
whether he is flying away from or
toward the station.
Now let us take a little flight with
our radio. The ceiling is low, and for
safe flying, we must climb up into the
clouds, or we might even fly above
them. Let us fly around awhile at ran-
dom without the radio, to get ourselves
lost, just to make the problem more
difficult. We will assume that we took
off from the Chicago Airport and that
we are working with the Chicago
Range. We tune the radio to 350 kilo-
cycles and hear the Chicago identifica-
tion (..-.), so we know we are listen-
ing to the correct station. Suppose we
hear a dot-dash, an A, through our
headphones. By looking at the map, we
know we are in either the X.W. or S.E.
quadrant, but do not know which one.
If we are going to get back to the field,
it is necessary to know this, so we will
go about finding where we are. Now by
looking at the map (see sketch) we can
see that by flying a course perpendicu-
lar to the bisector of the A quadrants,
we should come across one of the
courses which will lead us directly to
the station. We choose to fly a course
of about 15°, expecting to intersect
either the N.E. or N.W. leg of the
range. (We could just as easily fly a
course of 300° and intersect either the
S.E. or S.W. leg.) After following this
course for a short time, a steady note
comes in through the headphones, but
it is not nearly as loud as the A signal.
The closer we get to the "on course"
region, the louder the continuous note
becomes, until it is nearly as loud as
the A signal. We now know we are in
the "A twilight'' zone, and the on
course zone is very close. Within a mat-
ter of a minute or so, the A disappears
and a continuous note is heard, broken
only by the station identification signal.
Now we know we are on one of the two
courses, but are little better off than be-
fore, for we do not know which direc-
tion to fly in order to find the station.
Therefore, we will make a 90° turn to
the right, and await developments. For
awhile, of course, we will hear only the
steady on course note, but we soon fly
into the twilight zone bordering the on
course region. At this point we can
definitely locate ourselves, for if we are
on the NW leg of the range, a 90° turn
would take the ship into an N quadrant,
while if on the NE leg, this turn would
take us back into an A quadrant. So


now we have located ourselves definite-
ly some place along, let us say, the NE
leg. When we hear the A twilight zone,
we make an approximate 270° turn to
the left to take us back on our course.
We see on the map that we must fol-
low a 245° course to get to the station,
so we set the ship on this course by the
compass, and start in. In order to keep
out of the path of any airplanes flying
away from the station on the same leg,
we will edge over to the right of the
course, in the N twilight zone.
As we approach the station, the vol-
ume increases in our headphones, so we
turn it down so it can be easily heard.
The beam becomes narrower as we ap-
proach the station, and we have slipped
off it a few times, but detected it
through our headphones, so we had no
difficulty in getting back on the course.
As we approach closer to the station,
the volume builds up very rapidly, and
immediately drops to practically zero.
We are in the "Cone of silence,"' and
know we are right over the station.
Now we know from the map that the
Chicago Airport is located about three-
fourths of a mile from the range sta-
tion on a course 150° from the station.
From our altitude of, say, 3,000 feet,
it would be impractical to try to spiral
down through the clouds and expect to
find the airport. Therefore, we turn to
the right and fly a 330° course out the
XW leg, which coincides with the di-
rection of the field away from the sta-
tion, only in the opposite direction. We
fly out this leg for about 8 or io
minutes and make a 180° turn and fly
a 150" course on the beam for the sta-
tion. We cut the motor somewhat so
that we will loose altitude and go down
to about 800 feet, where we level off
and continue toward the station. As
we approach the station again, the vol-
ume builds up to a peak and falls off
abruptly, telling us we are again in the
cone of silence, and over the station.
We immediately throttle the motor and
start the glide, taking care to keep the
ship headed on the proper course. If
we continue this glide, we will bring the
Chicago Airport right under our wheels.
If the ceiling is still where we left it,
we will break through the clouds high
enough above the ground to make a
normal landing. This is the system used
by the greater part of the pilots in lo-
cating an airport by means of the radio
and radio range.
Having mastered Instrument Flying


fly to our destination without having
to see the ground until only a few hun-
dred feet above it. We are, however,
still just one step away from the ulti-
mate goal, that is, to land without see-
ing the ground until just before the
contact, or even without seeing it at all.
Landing by instrument alone has been
done innumerable times, but it is still
in the experimental state. Within a
short time, without a doubt, the air-
plane will operate without regard for
weather by using the special radio
equipment which is now being per-
fected. The airplane will then be the
only form of transportation, with the
exception of walking, which will no
longer be hindered by fog. The more
severe forms of weather are no longer
a problem even now, since the Depart-
ment of Commerce broadcasts regular
weather reports over the Radio Range
Stations. There is no excuse for a pilot's
not knowing of the weather conditions
which he will encounter on his course,
and it is always possible to fly around
severe local disturbances.
A pilot learns to depend upon his
instruments and radio, and when he is
unable to use them, he knows he is
endangering himself and others if he
tries to fly in unfavorable weather. The
instruments and radio make it perfectly
safe to fly in weather which would
otherwise cause the sensible pilot to
stay on the ground. With their use, the
use of the airplane has been extended to
its present scope.

POLITE EXPLOSIONS FOR MODERN
COAL MINERS
Because large pieces of coal—the so-
called "premium" variety—are more
valuable than small ones, and in order
to escape the fumes which hamper work
and sometimes endanger life, certain
coal-mining areas in Illinois and Indi-
ana have discarded dynamite blasting
in favor of compressed air. Specially-
designed compressor-drives, motors, and
control devices for a new equipment
built and introduced into the mining
districts by the Sullivan Machinery
Company of Chicago have been fur-
nished by the General Electric Com-
pany. With the new equipment the coal
is "politely pushed" out of place by the
air pressure.
The coal dust and chips which are
broken out by the dynamite are difficult
to handle and bring much lower prices
on the market than the larger chunks.
With the absence of fumes under the
new method, miners can start loading
coal immediately after the "shooting"'
and do not have to wait until the air
clears. The mine level does not have
to be vacated, as is the case when ex-
plosives are used.
With the new method a portable com-
pressor stores air up to 15,000 pounds
pressure in a long metal cartridge. The
latter is inserted in a hole drilled in the
face of the coal and a valve suddenly
releases the air, which, in expanding,
pushes out the coal in big chunks. The
steel cartridges are specially designed
and may be used over again. The entire
operation is conducted directly at the
coal face, and cartridges are filled in
90 seconds. Miners and equipment re-
treat to a distance of 100 or ISO feet
during the explosion.
HEAT FLOW SIMPLIFIED
Professor A. D. Moore has taken
enough time from his teaching and
head-mentoring to invent an interesting
piece of apparatus. The direction of
heat flow in machines is usually found
by means of complicated analytic equa-
tions. Professor Moore's machine solves
the problem by the use of hydraulic
analogy. Only a small model has been
built, but a larger one is now being con-
structed. The practical application of
this apparatus is in helping solve the
problem of heat elimination in machin-
ery, especially in the electrical world.

WATER IN NAVAL TANK LASHED
TO FOAM BY RESEARCH WORK
The Naval Tank is getting a large
dose of overwork these days as Profes-
sors Bragg and Adams carry on their
research problems. Professor Bragg is
testing barge and river boat models for
a Pittsburgh company. To get proper
results, a flooring, or false bottom, eight
inches from the surface of the water,
has been placed in the tank. This is to
simulate conditions in the Ohio River,
which has a depth of 25 feet. The barge
models are made in three pieces, bolted
together. The front and rear sections
may be changed for other sections to
determine the optimum design for the
barge. One of these full-size river boats
has already been built with modifica-
tions found necessary after the test
runs.
Professor Adams recently received a
Faculty Research Grant to investigate
"the influence of form on resistance to
rolling" of ships at sea. When ques-
tioned as to his progress, Adams replied.
"I've just about got the 'bugs' out of
the apparatus."

Now that 1936 has finally arrived and everyone has
broken those New Year resolutions, allow us to give you a
few more to break. Resolve to cut at least one-third of your
classes. This shows your prof that you are a real grown-up
upperclassman and can cut class and everything. Resolve
not to hand in your reports on time. This shows the instruc-
tor that you don't intend to allow him to become too manda-
tory. Resolve to stand in the Arch and comment on the co-
eds. This shows your classmates that you are an expert on
(he virtues and vices of women.
The prize for the faculty public appearance of 1935 is
awarded to the prof in the aero department who woke up
one morning and found his picture plastered on the front
page of W. R. Hearst's Detroit Times in the company of
two Miami mermaids clad in the conventional bathing suit. o
Our roving reporter wandered into the Union early last
month on a return trip from the Bell and immediately
noticed quite a few familiar faces. Inquiring at the desk,
he was told that the Engineering Ball was in progress.
Flashing his identification card on the two gorillas at the
landing, he sped upstairs and down the hall to the dimly
lighted ballroom. Seating himself by the door, our reporter
soon accustomed his eyes to the twilight and began to ob-
serve the whirling couples. Quite a change had taken place
in the appearance of those rough and ready he-men who
wander the halls of the West Engine building by day.
Suddenly his attention was attracted to a twirling couple
on the floor. He recognized the fellow as Ted Thermo, chair-
man of the committee for late hours. As the pair flashed
by he saw that Ted's partner was none other than Miss
Lena Wayback, prominent in the undergraduate women's
circles. Racking his memory, our Ann Arbor correspondent
remembered that Miss Wayback worshiped publicity. An
evil glint appeared in the reporter's eyes and a low snarl
was audible as he whipped out his notebook and pencil. The
following story was received by us the next day:
"Among those seen at the Engineering Ball were Ted
Thermo, chairman of the committee for late permission, and
Miss Lena Wayback, president of Wee Nu Yu. Mr. Thermo
was charmingly clad in a three-piece suit of dark material.
The color scheme chosen was a contrasting black and white.
The coat of dark material was cut away in the front and
hung to the knees in the back. The vest of white pique was
gracefully fashioned with pockets and held in back by a
clever strap and buckle arrangement. The pants, also of
dark material, were suspended from the waist by a natty
strap scheme and hung nearly to the floor. A white shirt of
pique with a stiff bosom was decorated by pearl studs and
cuff links to match. The neck was gracefully encircled by a
high wing tip collar and white pique tie. The effect was
quite chic. Mr. Thermo also wore jet black holeproof hose
held up by the gripping action of elastic bands. They were
keen. Carefully shined shoes of patent leather added the
final touch. Smart accessories included a silver watch-and-
key chain, a cigarette case and lighter and a quart flask.
"Miss Wayback, who accompanied Mr. Thermo, wore the
conventional formal attire."

rication of many products. The
welding of mechanical refrigera-
tors and gas ranges is typical of
its production applications. Other
typical applications include weld-
ing of chromium steel for re-
sistance to sea water corrosion on
seaplane pontoons, welding
aluminum fuel tanks for airplanes,
welding of the frame work of
alloy steel on the new high speed
railroad trains, welding of stain-
less steel beer barrels and innu-
merable other familiar products.
Welding is Simple
Production Tool
Welding is the preferred method
of fabricating almost every design
in modern metals. Jointless weld-
ing can be done rapidly with a
minimum of preparation of the
pieces to be joined. Under pro-
cedure control providing jigs for
positioning pieces, production
can be as rapid and as free from
rejections as any highly devel-
oped factory process. From the
plant equipment standpoint it is
easy to adopt welding. From the
personnel standpoint the welding
technique is quickly acquired
through instruction by compe-
tent engineers.
Welding is an important aid in
securing the full benefit of the
newer light weight alloys, corro-
sion- and stain-resistant steels
and other ferrous and non-ferrous
metals. Jointless welded designs
in these new metals make the
finished product attractive in ap-
pearance, efficient and economical
to use and enable it to be priced
salably.
In All Industries
Fabrication by welding can be
undertaken without heavy capi-
tal expenditures and carried out
at low cost. Welding is used in
every industry for maintenance,
for construction and for the fab-

For Jointless Strength

Products fabricated by welding
are jointless, leakproof, perma-
nent and safe. Improved methods
of testing make it possible to tell
exactly what stresses or loads a
jointless welded assembly can
take. Metals of different compo-
sitions, providing the most suit-
able material for the service it is
to perform, can be welded into
sound unified assemblies forever
free from any of the losses which
occur from joint failures.

To utilize the new alloys and
metals fully, the advice of com-

GENERAL CHAIRMAN
James M. "Pat" O'Dea has been
referred to as Detroit's general chair-
man. Whenever a celebrity is headed
Detroitward, Mr. O'Dea is called upon
to make arrangements for the entertain-
ment of the important personage. This
James M. O'Dea
is, however, nothing new for "Pat.''
Looking back over his past record, we
find that he has been managing or di-
recting something for the greater part
of his life.
"Pat" O'Dea came to the University
of Michigan from Pontiac, and he
served as secretary of his class in his
freshman year. In the course of his
college career he was a member of the
Union Reception Committee and was
chairman of the Union House Commit-
tee. He served on the Board of Control
of the Michiganensian as associate edi-
tor of that publication and was elected
to Vulcans in his senior year.
After taking his degree in electrical
engineering in 1909, Mr. O'Dea went to
work in Detroit and has remained in
that city. During this period of time
he has been purchasing agent for the
Detroit Edison Company, sales man-
ager for Dodge Brothers, and president
of Graham-Paige Company of Mich-
igan. He is now president of James M.
O'Dea, Incorporated, Graham Distrib-
utors. In addition, he has been a direc-
tor of the University of Michigan Alum-
ni Association. He is a director of the
Union Investment Company, director of

WHO'S WHERE AND WHY
January, the month when good reso-
lutions are forgotten under the strain of
final examinations and post-holiday
parties, is with us again. We hope that
old Santa brought you that new slip-
stick (or the new sport roadster) you've
been wanting; and, of course, we hope
you were among those present ringing
out the old and ringing in the new. But
let's forget the holidays for a bit and
settle down to the business of telling
you who's where and why.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


The most recent acknowledgment of
Professor John S. Worley's understand-
ing of traffic problems was his selection
as director of the Detroit safety drive.
This was announced by a headline in
the Detroit News, October 29, "U. M.
EXPERT TACKLES CITY'S TRAF-
FIC PROBLEMS." Results of the in-
tensive study of Detroit's traffic prob-
lem will not be available for some time,
but we may be sure that the final con-
clusions will benefit the existing situa-
tion.
For the last thirteen years John Ste-
phen Worley has been Professor of
Professor Worley
Transportation Engineering and Cura-
tor of the Transportation Library, the
only library of its kind in existence. The
library was begun by Professor Worley
and has grown to 100,000 volumes on
all phases of transportation.
Born in Missouri, Professor Worley
studied at the University of Missouri
for two years. He then dropped out to
manage a mercantile business, got
married and enrolled in the University
of Kansas with Mrs. Worley. For five
years he attended college and worked
in the summers. In 1904 he received his
Master's degree and went to Toledo,
Ohio, where he became chief assistant
engineer for Riggs and Sherman Co.
Mr. Riggs is now Professor Riggs,
honorary professor of Civil Engineering
here. Worley did work on waterworks,
sewerage plant construction, and the
location, design, construction, and oper-
ation of interurban railway lines.
After five years, Worley went back to
Kansas City and created the engineering
firm of Worley and Black, which special-
ized in waterworks and water purifica-
tion plants. From 1913 to 1920 he was
a member of the Engineering Board of
the Interstate Commission and the
next year he was consulting valuation
engineer for the Commission. He next
became a junior member of the firm
of Thompson and Worley, financial
accountants and engineers, in New
York. It was then that the University
of Michigan invited Professor \Vorley
to become head of the newly-organized
Transportation Department. From 1921
to 1926 he was federal receiver, execu-
tive vice-president and general manager
of the Habirshaw Electric Cable Co.
and affiliated companies.
Professor Worley is a member of the
Missouri Bar, having been admitted in
1919. He is also a member of Sigma
Chi, Tau Beta Pi, Sigma Xi, A.S.C.E.,
A.R.E.A., and the Detroit Safety Com-
mission. Since 1933 he has been con-
sulting engineer for the Detroit Street
Railways.

MODEL OF BOULDER DAM
Prof. H. W. King of the Hydraulic
Engineering Department has recently
received an aluminum model of Boulder
Dam and power house. The model was
sent to him by Mr. Nalder, assistant
Chief Designing Engineer on the project.
This model, made of cast aluminum,
is approximately 14" x 20" x 7". The
canyon walls are hollow, permitting one
to see the tunnels and penstocks which
run beneath the canyon walls. The
inside of these panels are inscribed with
the names of the engineers and contrac-
tors who had the most to do with the
design and construction of the dam.
The outside of the panels are decorated
with frescoes symbolic of the purposes
to which the structure is dedicated.

WIND TUNNEL
HAS RIVAL
With actual construction begun over
a year ago, the new auxiliary wind tun-
nel being built for the Aero department
by the N.Y.A. is nearing completion.
It is expected to be ready for use early
in June.
Its design is of the vertical, single
return-duct type and is located directly
behind the large wind tunnel in the
basement of the East Engineering build-
ing. Twelve separate sections are
clamped together to form a rectangle in
a vertical plane. All are of wood except
the reducing section which is shaped
out of sheet metal. The throat or sec-
tion in which the tests proper are con-
ducted rests on the floor immediately
behind the reducing section. Jet dimen-
sions at the throat are two by two and
one-half feet. Although most tests are
to be made with the closed throat ar-
rangement, it will be possible to remove
the constriction and make open-throat
runs. A four-blade adjustable pitch
propeller, an innovation in wind tunnel
design, is to be mounted in the upper
part of the channel. Aero students,
under the direction of Professor Thomp-
son, designed the tunnel to give the
equivalent of a sixty-mile wind. It will
be used chiefly for instruction in Aero 6,
a course in experimental aerodynamics.

ANCHOR MAN
In the Stadium, the engineers point
to Sweet, in the Coliseum they point to
David, but down on Ferry Field in the
spring they will have plenty to watch in
Stan Birleson, '37E. Stan's favorite
race is the 440, and
he is also anchor
man on the mile
relay team. He
holds the Field
House record of
48.7 seconds for the
440.
Birleson hails
from Muskegon
Heights where he
was the center for
the basketball team
and varsity quarter-
miler. He came to
Ann Arbor and im-
mediately took up track in a big way,
running both 220 and 440 on the frosh
team. Last year Stan made the varsity
easily and also a letter.
In May when Ferry Field saw the
battle between Jesse Owen and Mich-
igan for the Big Ten Outdoor cham-
pionship, the last race and final event
of the afternoon was the mile relay. If
Michigan won, she won the title, if not
—? Stan ran anchor on that team and
that team finished first, winning race,
meet and title. Quite a finish for a
sophomore on a team such as Michigan
puts on the cinder paths.
Stan was elected to Triangles this
fall. We want to predict greater things
for Stan this spring and next, and we*re
sure that he will do his best to keep
Michigan's team on top.

SELF-PROPELLED AIR-CONDITION-
ING SYSTEM
In order to cut down the weight of
refrigeration equipment on Pullman
coaches, a self-contained unit has been
developed by the Wankesha Motor
Company working with the Chicago
and Northwestern car department. The
unique feature of this unit is the engine
—an internal combustion engine burn-
ing liquefied propane. The source of
power complies with all the demands
that could be made, namely cheap
power, quiet running, light weight, auto-
matic control, no objectionable fumes
and it need not be refueled at untimely
moments. To eliminate vibration the en-
tire compressing unit is placed on pneu-
matic tires.

Think?
Question: Are there opportunities for North
American Engineers in South America?
Answer: by Dr. Preston E. James,
Professor of Geography.
A few North American companies
operating in South America still offer
employment for young engineers. Such
companies include electrical or indus-
trial concerns, mining and petroleum
companies, plantations or sugar compa-
nies, and other similar organizations.
To be sure the salaries offered are not
very different from those given for sim-
ilar training and experience in the
United States; but the opportunity to
gain experience and breadth of perspec-
tive by service in a foreign country gen-
erally becomes a permanent asset which
later is indirectly reflected in income.
Application for such employment might
be made to the personnel departments
of the large companies, or to the Amer-
ican Engineering Societies' Employment
Service, 29 W. 39th St., New York City.
No engineer or any other person
should go to South America hoping to
find a job when he arrives there. Many
South American countries do not look
with favor at foreigners entering their
territory in search of employment. To
a greater and greater extent their own
young men can furnish the necessary
technical services. North American col-
lege men are notoriously unable to ad-
just themselves to the very different
customs and manners of foreign peoples:
only too frequently has the good old
"American superiority complex" given
the South Americans cause cordially to
dislike these northerners.
One more word of warning. Jobs in
South America are much less secure
than those at home. Many of the ven-
tures, especially in the mines and plan-
tations, are decidedly speculative. In
times of depression, work is promptly
discontinued and the employees dis-
charged. This may happen, as we all
know, even at home. It is almost cer-
tain to happen in foreign fields.

A LETTER FROM NIC
Dear Fellows:
I guess the Editor's plea last month
did do some good, because I received
a number of communications in my
mailbox. To Robert Somers, Richard
Bergner, Don Williamson, and those
correspondents who preferred anonym-
ity, I want to say, "Thank you." Your
comments, suggestions and contribu-
tions were appreciated.
I was surprised to find two poems
among the contributions. Although it
was impossible to print either of them
this month, they will appear later in the
year.
Comments on the magazine seemed
to be quite generally favorable, with
the employment series holding the cen-
ter of interest. We're glad you like these
articles, but all the credit belongs to the
men who wrote them. If you have an
opportunity to speak to those men di-
rectly, why not let them know that you
are pleased with their work?
Due to the fact that my mailbox is
no longer on the bulletin board, Edith
Taylor has asked me to tell you to di-
rect all further communications to the
Technic office. Nic

TUBES THAT PASS THROUGH A NEEDLE'S EYE
Tubing, usually associated with moderate or large diam-
eters, is made commercially in such small sizes that the tube
can be threaded through a needle. Standard production of
such minute tubes includes from 15 to 20 drawing opera-
tions, a half-inch diameter cold rolled nickel stock being the
starting point. Annealing in a hydrogen atmosphere follows
each draw. The ordinary pickling to remove scale is, of
course, impossible; a quick acid wash and rinse followed
by drying is substituted. The resulting tube is .012 of an
inch outside diameter—about four times that of a human
hair—and .0015 of an inch thick.
These tubes find application in hypodermic needles, lead-
in wires for cathode radio tubes, neon lights, and so forth.
Tubes of various sizes and shapes made from nickel are of
service in a multitude of ways. Recent development has
produced a larger size tube which is really one tube inside
another (different metals) but drawn together. They can
withstand pressures of 100,000 pounds per sq. in.
DEVELOPMENT OF A WATER-COOLED UNDER-FED
STOKER
Many power plants in the middle west have felt the need
of using coal mined in that vicinity. Such coals were un-
suitable because of their low ash fusion temperature. Hence
the engineers set about to rectify the situation—water cool-
ing of the stoker resulted. The first step involved cooling
only the tuyeres, but subsequent developments included ex-
tending the water-cooled tuyeres to the ash pit and also
running these pipes down over the edge of the grate. When
the features were embodied into one, remarkable dependa-
bility and efficiency were obtained even on the fuel which
otherwise would have caused clogging of the tuyeres due to
molten ash.
Not only are no difficulties in operation and performance
encountered in this water-cooled stoker, but the fuel bed is
more porous and even, less power is required to force the
fuel into the bed, higher preheating of the air is permitted,
and because of the even distribution of the coal, higher
burning rates may be employed. Furthermore, boiler tests
of seven days at hard and fast steaming have shown that
the pipes in the fuel bed which are of course connected to
the drum are not scaled or worn. It is therefore seen that
this installation is extremely reliable and satisfactory.
HYDROCENATION OF BITUMINOUS COAL
Because coal cannot be used directly as a power source
for internal combustion engines and compression ignition
engines, the Europeans have been working since 1921 on
a process for converting it into petrol. Naturally, England
with her large coal deposits has been most interested, and
recently a large plant at Billingham for the hydrogenation
of bituminous coal to gasoline and fuel oil was completed
and put into operation.
The process as operated at the Billingham plant consists
essentially of two stages: (1) hydrogenation in the liquid
phase, and (2) hydrogenation in the vapor phase. In the
former, tars and coal in suspension in liquid oil are charged
into a converter, and an intermediate "middle oil" is formed
under the correct pressure and temperature, and in the
presence of a finely divided catalyst. The second stage con-
sists of converting this middle oil in the vapor state to petrol
over a static catalyst. The converters are of special construc-
tion, and much auxiliary equipment is necessary.

CIVIL ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT—Begg's Deformator used to determine the
stresses in a Vierendeel truss and rigid frame viaduct by observing the elastic be-
havior of celluloid models.
The use of models in the analysis of statically indeterminate structures has
increased greatly in the past few years. Many types of structures, for which the
mathematical calculations are very laborious and sometimes inexact, can be conven-
iently solved by the measurement of deformations in models of various materials.
The Begg's apparatus, which is illustrated here, provides a very accurate and
cenvenient method of actually measuring minute displacements in small size models
by means of calibrated microscopes. With this apparatus no forces are measured as
the analysis can be made by means of reciprocal displacements.
Other types of models and measuring devices are also used in the analysis of
structures in which known forces are applied and the corresponding displacements
measured. The type of model to be selected depends upon the characteristics of the
prototype.

LIGHT READING
It lias won a prize, but you will not find it in the
bookstore. The movie rights will not be sold; it
will, alas, never be a best seller.
The title is: Non-Riemannian Dynamics of Rotating
Electrical Machinery; the author: Gabriel Kron,
University of Michigan, '24, G-E engineer. The
award is the first prize of the George Montefiore
Foundation of the University of Liege, Belgium—
10,000 Belgian francs.
Tastes in literature differ; Gabriel Kron's preferences
run to higher mathematics. Some years ago, he
went on a walking tour around the world, and he
took with him for light reading a book full of integral
signs, tensors, matrix transformations, and elliptic
functions. Instead of the usual souvenirs, he brought
back the material for the paper that won him the
Belgian prize. He also reports that the total cost
of the trip was only $200! It suggests a tip for those
who have trouble with padded hotel bills. Try
carrying a calculus book on your travels!
SECOND SIGHT
The complete electric man is being built piecemeal.
Electric eyes and ears came first, and loud-speakers
with electric vocal cords. Now comes the machine
with a memory and the gift of second sight. It has
been developed by G-E research scientists to study
the causes of failure of electronic tubes.
Something unusual happens in a tube. It is all over
in a few hundredths of a second. Then, when peace
has settled down, a camera shutter clicks and
records on the film the story, not only of the dis-
turbance and its aftermath, but of the events that
led up to the disturbance.
Two modern devices make this possible: the
cathode-ray oscillograph and the thyratron. The
oscillograph is on the job, day and night, tracing
on its fluorescent screen the history of the faithful
operation of the tube. Then, unexpectedly, after
months have elapsed, perhaps in the wee hours of
the morning, the tube goes haywire. The disturbance
sets off the thyratron tube which, in turn, trips the
camera shutter, The disturbance has been over for
a fiftieth of a second, but the trace still lingers on
the oscillograph screen, and is photographed. No
longer need the scientist hover anxiously over his
apparatus. He can lie comfortably in his bed, know-
ing that the prerecording oscillograph will remember
all that happened during the night and tell him
about it in the morning.
CHINA CLIPPER
The Pan-American China Clipper which recently
inaugurated trans-Pacific mail and passenger serv-
ice in its epoch-making flight from California to the
Philippines and back, carries several aids to flight
which have been developed by General Electric
especially for aviation service.
Each of the giant ship's four 830-hp Pratt &amp;
Whitney Twin Wasp engines is equipped with built-
in G-E superchargers. Complete sets of G-E electric
tachometers and electric oil-temperature gauges
help the engineering officer at his post in the first
compartment to check on the performance of the
engines.

CHEMISTRY
OIL PRODUCTION
AIY development that materializes from a laboratory
problem to a million dollar business in the short space
of three years is, to be sure, of widespread importance.
That, in essence, is the history of Dowell Incorporated,
through which as a subsidiary of The Dow Chemical
Company, Dow is bringing chemistry to the aid of oil
production.
Ever since old "Colonel" Drake sank the first oil well
of commercial importance in 1859, oil producers have
faced two basic obstacles in their efforts to drain
nature's vast underground reservoirs of petroleum.
First, in many instances, greater production was pos-
sible if the producing formation could be opened up—
creating fissures and channels from which oil could feed
in to the "hole" and be pumped to the surface.
For years the only means of accomplishing this was to
"shoot" the well—to lower a charge of explosives and
blast. While reasonably effective, this method was
hazardous to both life and the well itself. Frequently,
in shattering the rock, subterranean water rushed in to
ruin the oil. Often, the great heat glazed the surface
of the rock, sealing its pores and defeating the purpose.
The second obstacle came with time. As the oil filtered
through the porous rock it deposited gums, paraffin
and resinous substances until the pores became clogged.
The rich flow of oil dropped off until finally the well
had to be abandoned.
Operating one hundred and thirty brine wells as the
source of basic chemicals, The Dow Chemical Company
faced similar problems. It turned its technicians' atten-
tion to finding the answers.
Starting with previous attempts to use hydrochloric
acid as a dissolver of limestone—attempts that largely
failed because the acid attacked metal tubing and equip-
ment as well as the rock—they found the answer in an
inhibitor. This ingredient added to the acid allowed it
to be pumped down to the rock where it performed the
necessary service of enlarging pores and opening
channels or, in different dilution, to free clogged pores,
thus reviving production.
To this basic development, Dowell Incorporated has
added many other chemical applications that are over'
coming specific difficulties in oil production.
Today Dowell Incorporated is a national organization.
It has treated more than 6000 wells and has put more
than 20,000,000 extra dollars into the pockets of oil
producers in only three years.
Last year it applied over 3,350,000 gallons of its special
inhibited acid to oil wells. Its trucks and cars traveled
over 1,275,000 miles rendering this great service.
But, important as is this part Dow is playing in serving
oil producers, it is only a segment of its contribution to
American industry. As one of the world's foremost
chemical companies, Dow produces over 250 products
that literally find their way into practically every phase
of industrial manufacturing, many pharmaceutical
products, farming and fruit growing as well.

For several years Professor Moore
has been investigating problems of heat
transfer. Heat situations in the tran-
sient state frequently present problems
bristling with difficulties. Simpler cases
can be solved mathematically. Some-
what worse problems can be worn down
by patient attacks through specialized
computing methods, sometimes aided
by graphics. But all this leaves a large
body of engineering heat problems of
so complex a nature that no method of
solution can yield close answers with
reasonable expenditure of time. Pro-
fessor Moore had already developed
some special graphical tools and meth-
ods, one of them being an extremely
simple and fast method for finding the
mean ordinate of any curve. Thus,
hunting for new types of solutions be-
came somewhat of a habit.
During the Christmas vacation, 1935,
Professor Moore was furthering his
knowledge of heat transfer by studying
streamline flow in tubes. Poiseuille's
Law proved to be the answer to his
questioning; for a long tube, having
steamline flow through it, would pass
water at a rate proportional to the
pressure loss. In other words, such
tubes would have constant resistance.
The principles for the Hydrocal almost
assembled themselves. An all-glass ex-
perimental job was built that week, and
tried out in the E. E. Seminar the suc-
ceeding week.
The Hydrocal solves problems by the
use of a hydrostatic analogy to mathe-
matical conditions. Suppose some com-
plex solid, such as a composition in-
sulating slab is to be heated or cooled.
Hypothetically, the slab can be divided
into a suitable number of incremental
slices. Each slice would have a thermal
capacity. A glass standpipe—one for
each slice — represents the
thermal capacity, in terms
of the standpipe's capacity
to hold water per inch rise.
Thermal resistance through
a slice is represented by the
constant resistance to flow
offered by a calibrated flow
tube. The standpipes are
connected, one to the next,
by means of properly se-
lected flow tubes. Differences in temper-
ature of the several slices are represented
by the differences in water level of the
various standpipes. Outside temperature
conditions are represented at will by
adjusting the levels of the two supply
tanks, which are connected, through
tubes, to the row of standpipes. Thus
the problem is divided in two parts, set
up on the Hydrocal, and the connec-
tions to flow are opened. As the levels
change, they give, with suitable accur-
acy, the changing temperatures at vari-
ous positions in the solid being studied.
The accompanying graph illustrates
the heat curves obtained by the Hydro-
cal. The curves 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 rep-
resent the temperatures of the different
slices at progressive intervals of time.
Temperature is plotted as ordinate, and
time as abcissa. Both are relative units.
These curves vary from the actual
mathematical curves by less than 1%,
and for the most part coincide. It must
be remembered that the problem can
be worked on the Hydrocal in one-tenth
the time.
An interesting experiment with the
Hydrocal is to find the mean ordinate
of any curve, a frequent engineering
problem. The levels of the water in the
tubes are adjusted to correspond to
points on the curve. By opening a valve,
each tube is connected with the rest,
Prof. Moore with his Hydrocal
and the water in each tube comes to
the same level. This common height is
necessarily the mean ordinate. Here we
have solved a very definite problem in
integration without complicated mathe-
matics or counting squares on graph
paper. Conic sections and more com-
plex curves are readily integrated by
the Hydrocal.
In the future, the Hydrocal will un-
doubtedly be used in many different
fields as a practical, simple, and speedy
method of computation. It is quite pos-
sible, for instance, that geologists will
find the Hydrocal helpful in calculating
the rate of cooling of the earth by
glaciers or lava eruptions. In fact the
possibilities of the Hydrocal's useful-
ness at present seem unlimited.
The early all-glass model previously
mentioned was soon replaced by a dem-
onstrator model having twelve stand-
pipes. Several demonstrations here
and in Detroit, Cornell, and New York,
served to stimulate a great deal of in-
terest in the new machine. Using the
experience gained from the construction
of the small machine, Professor Moore
spent last summer designing the new
large scale Hydrocal. In order to handle
a wide variety of solutions with ease,
special kinds of valving arrangements
had to be incorporated. All these had
to be devised and developed. There are

The large Hydrocal, while not com-
pletely finished, yet is in thorough
working shape. It would undoubtedly
still be in the slow process of construc-
tion but for the invitation to demon-
strate it before the American Chemical
Society's Heat Transfer Symposium at
Yale University, December 30-31. Work
was pushed day and night, and the new
machine first saw operation on Christ-
mas day, five days before it was due at
Yale.
Back of this machine lie many
months of research and development.
A very accurate calibrator had to be
designed and built, on which the flow
characteristics of the tubes could be
worked out. On this apparatus standard
tubes are produced. The glass stand-
pipes, accurate to within one per cent,
are selected at the Corning Glass Com-
pany and checked here.
Mr. Rundel, of the E. E. Depart-
ment's Instrument Room, did almost all
of the intricate work of making and
assembling the new machine. The
workmanship is something of which he
may well be proud.
Patents were applied for last sum-
mer, and the application is making un-
usually good progress. Professor Moore
is not as yet ready to make any state-
ment as to manufacture of units similar
to the present Hydrocal.
In the illustration it is possible to
follow the operation of the machine.
The two gages at the left, to which Pro-
fessor Moore is pointing, are the ones
that represent the set temperatures of
the body and contacting medium. The
curve on the Hydrocal is typical of the
general run of problems.

Naval architects are not altogether
concerned with the problems of deep-
seagoing ships, but due to the extensive
development of the coastwise and in-
land waterways, including our rivers,
they find themselves equally involved in
the design of shallow water vessels. The
fact that ship performance is greatly in-
fluenced by the depth of water in which
a run is being made has brought about
the necessity for equipment which will
give definite experimental information
about given ship-form relative to either
deep or shallow water conditions.
The demand for pre-construction
data is an important factor in ship de-
sign. Scientific experimental methods in
marine work, or in any other field, are
never complete until there are ways of
examining all the cases involved. Be-
cause of the desire to have such a com-
plete layout for experimenting in the
Naval Tank, the Marine Department
has recently acquired and installed a
new "adjustable bottom." This shallow
bottom, the only one in the United
States at the present time, was designed
by Professor L. A. Baier, who is carry-
ing out a research project on shallow
water effects on resistance.
This addition to the Naval Tank has
by
JAMES F. GOODRICH. '36E
brought about the possibility of re-
sistance and form tests at any depth.
The construction of the "adjustable
bottom" is simple; it consists of chan-
nel beams suspended on threaded steel
rods athwart of the Tank, with sheet-
iron plates laid lengthwise from beam
to beam. Its total length is approxi-
mately 135 feet and its width about 15
feet. By turning the rods at the upper
ends the channels are made to move up
or down as desired, hence making it pos-
sible to adjust the whole unit to any
given depth.
Thus far, observations of the runs
made in shallow water have been inter-
esting and gratifying. What has been
known to happen with vessels in shoal
water is now being studied in detail by
experimental model towing in the Tank.
By such testing it is hoped to reduce
undesirable qualities in hull structure to
a minimum.
Designers of shallow water vessels
must consider four points with regard
to performance; namely, speed and
power, steering qualities, change in
trim, and wave-making. Each of these
points will be considered in this discus-
sion, showing what actually happens in
practice and what has been found under
ava
similar conditions in the Tank.
The first consideration is the speed
for a given shaft horsepower, which is,
of course, in direct relation to resist-
ance. In deep water—and by deep water
is meant a depth approximately equal
to or greater than the length of the ves-
sel—there is no apparent difference in
resistance at constant speed and con-
stant displacement. There is, however,
a marked increase in resistance, other
conditions remaining the same, when
water depth less than that equal to the
length is encountered. The shallower
the water the greater the resistance.
This may be seen readily in the accom-
panying chart, where resistance in
pounds per short ton displacement is
plotted against depth of water in feet,
the speed being five and one-quarter
miles per hour and the displacement re-
maining the same. So effective is this
increased resistance of a ship passing
from deep water into shallow water
that the difference in speed is easily
noticed. As one captain stated, "It feels
as though something suddenly takes
hold of the stern of the ship and tries
to pull it astern."
This means, naturally, that in con-
tracting for a maximum speed the ship-

his propellers to meet the service re-
quirements. Model testing eliminates
guess work from this consideration.
Heretofore there has been no means of
definitely determining what would be
required of the power plant in a vessel.
By testing the model over the shallow
bottom there can be no doubt as to
what will be required of the engines.
This is the primary function of testing
models of vessels before construction is
begun, and it tends to eliminate the
possibility of falling under contract
speed when the "trial trip" takes place.
Due regard must always be given the
steering qualities of a vessel. It is a
well established fact that the under
water shape of a floating body is very
influential on the way it handles while
in motion. This effect is noticeable re-
gardless of where a run is being made.
Ships are usually referred to by their
operators as being "hard" or "easy"
steering. There are cases where it is
difficult for a wheelsman to hold a
course even in smooth water. This may
be caused by several factors that can
be adjusted or corrected, or in some
cases is inherent in the design itself.
This difficulty is accentuated quite
markedly at high speeds in shallow
water, regardless of the under water
structure, and it is one of the jobs of
the naval architect to produce lines
which will give the least possible trouble
in steering. Here again, the model in
fhe Tank will tell him. to some degree
at least, whether or not he has pro-
duced the Hp=i(in which will give the de-
sired results.
From the experimental results of
shallow water tests it will now be pos-
sible to forecast the safe speeds that
may be maintained for given depths.
There is, however, another consideration
which is greatly dependent upon speed
and depth and which will, in most cases,
govern the speed before steering is
materially affected. This, we shall now
examine under the heading of trim.
Trim, it must be explained, is the
position of a vessel in the water with
reference to the horizontal plane. In
speaking of this condition it is said that
a ship is "down by the stern" if the
stern is lower than the bow, or "down
by the head" if the reverse condition is
true. It is interesting to note here that
the water depth influences the trim, so
that it is necessary to limit the draft of
a vessel while loading to avoid ground-
ing when moving in shallow water. For
example, when large deep-draft ships
traverse the channels approaching har-
bors there is at times very little clear-
ance between the bottom of the channel
and the keel. Because the stern tends

liken at o given displacement.
DEPTH OF WATER IN FEET
to drop, relative to its position with the
bow in deep water, slow speeds must be
held. In large vessels this drop may be
upward of several feet. Similar action
is easily seen when a towed model
passes from deep to shallow water. The
stern squats very noticeably, especially
at higher speeds. In fact, increased
speeds produce increased tendencies
toward this movement.
As has been concluded in the last two
cases, speed and under-body form are
again responsible. Here, too, it is found
that by experiment the design may be
approached which will give the least
amount of change in trim when shallow
water is encountered. Several years ago
people on the Upper Hudson River
complained that when the fast passen-
ger boats went past their docks in the
restricted channels they produced such
large waves along the bank that con-
siderable destruction resulted. In fact,
the owners of the steamers found them-
selves in so many lawsuits over this
trouble that it finally became necessary
to make radical changes in the under-
bodies of their boats. Had models of
the hulls been tested prior to construc-
tion of the original boats, as was finally
necessary, it is highly probable that
there would have been no added ex-
pense of alterations.
In the Tank, bow waves, stern waves
and wake may be studied with high pre-
cision. It has been observed that these
differ widely in shallow and in deep
water. Because of the troubles described
above, river boats and barges require
more consideration along this line than
do seagoing vessels. Work of this type
which may be done in the new shallow
bottom should prove to be helpful to
the naval architect and should certainly
add toward more economical water
transportation.
With the addition of this new adjust-
able bottom to the Naval Tank, stu-
dents in the Department of Marine En-
gineering now have available a well
equipped naval laboratory, second only
to the tank at Washington. Commer-
cial firms and shipbuilding companies
that have realized the possibilities of
this work will be able to benefit by it to
a point not yet wholly appreciated.

The development of complex equip-
ment for use in industry has progressed
so far that today it is difficult for a
salesman without engineering training
to apply and sell this equipment. Since
an engineer is inherently a poor sales-
man, the value of a man who has the
combination of sales ability and a
broad engineering knowledge is con-
stantly increasing.
In general, there are two main factors
which should determine the particular
phase of engineering that a young engi-
neer should follow. First, will he derive
from his work the mental activity nec-
essary for his personal development and
at the same time will it be of sufficient
interest so that he will enjoy doing it?
The second consideration is, will this
line of endeavor afford sufficient finan-
cial returns to permit him to enjoy the
comforts of life? It is truly a hard task
for a man who has charge of a business
which requires technically trained sales-
men to determine just what type of
young man will make a good sales engi-
neer, because the requirements of a
good sales engineer not only incorporate
all the qualities that are required of any
man to be successful in any position,
but in addition to these qualities, re-
quire certain intangible factors in the
makeup of the man that will enable him
to sell his product against competition.
Personality Essential
I would say that the first questions
that the technical undergraduate who
is seriously considering following the
sales engineering game should ask him-
self are: "Do I like to meet people?"
"Is it easy for people to talk to me?"
and "Do people enjoy being with me?"
We must understand, in going out to
sell a product, that until the time the
sales engineer has called on his prospec-
tive customer, the customer did very
well without him and no doubt the cus-
tomer feels that he will get along very
well if he never sees the sales engineer.
This is the basis upon which we start.
What is to be done, and what are the
qualities necessary in the salesman to
convince this prospective customer that
ho should buy this equipment. In the
first place, the sales engineer must
know his product in every detail. In
fact, the attitude of prospective buyers
today is to consider the sales engineer
as an expert in his line. The sales engi-
neer of today often functions in the
capacity of a consulting engineer in his
particular line. While the sales engineer
is not at all times conversant with the
most minute details of his product, he
can always call upon the Engineering
Department of the company he repre-
sents to give the prospective customer
the desired information.
A sales engineer must be of the en-
thusiastic type. He must be able to
stir up enthusiasm in his prospective
customer and make him believe that the
product which the sales engineer rep-
resents is as fine as he claims it to be.
Preparation Recommended
Up to this point, you can readily see
that it is important for the young man
who intends to follow the commercial
end of engineering to first decide upon
the line of equipment which he will en-
joy selling, and second, to contact the
people who manufacture this type of
equipment. The embryo salesman
should expect to start in the factory of
the manufacturer with whom he ob-
tains a position. My recommendation
would be that he spend at least a year
in the plant assembling and testing, and
also spend a good deal of time in the
engineering department to acquaint
himself thoroughly with the product
which he intends to sell.
After the salesman has acquainted
himself with his product, the next im-
portant step is for him to become
acquainted with or well versed in the
application of that product to industry
and to learn everything about the par-
ticular industry with which he will deal.
He must be in a position to speak his
customer's language. In many classes
of sales work, salesmen follow certain
definite industries, depending upon the
territory in which they operate. For
instance, if a man were to devote his
efforts in the Pittsburgh territory, his
clientele would be composed practically
en'rely of steel mill customers. How-
ever, if he were to center in Akron,
Ohio, his customers would be principal-
ly in ths rubber industry.
Some time ago, an article was writ-
ten by a sales executive, stating that
only about 4 per cent of the men who
started in sales work really made good.
Naturally, we ask ourselves "Why is
this percentage so low?" The chief
reason is that most men working either
in a factory, Engineering Department,
executive offices, or other departments of
the plant, are directly responsible to
some executive who is constantly watch-
ing over them. In a measure, this is
true in sales work, but not to the extent
mentioned above. For instance, a young
man working out of a branch office has
?. certain number of calls to make.
These calls can be made very mechani-
cally; by that I mean, simply calling
on a man, talking to him a few minutes,
bidding him goodbye, and going on his
way to the next customer. Or, he can
go to the town where he is to call on
people, and, inasmuch as there is no-
body there to watch that he gets on the
job at eight o'clock and works until
five, the young man might elect to stay
in bed until noon, possibly call on one
or two people, and then call it a day.
Of course, eventually, in spite of the
fact that he fakes a complete sales re-
port, he is caught because orders will
not come in from such work.
I do not believe there is a phase of
the engineering game where the check-
up is as closely made as in the com-
mercial end. In the first place, the

late his production, which is determined
entirely by the volume of sales. Nat-
urally, if any one particular man does
not bring in the amount of business
expected from him, he can be immedi-
ately checked. There will be a certain
class of men who will always bring in
just enough business to keep them on
the job. I personally call this class the
"dub" class, those who will always
make enough money to live on and get
by, but lack the ability and spark to
put themselves over and become really
high grade men in their work.
It is rather difficult to train sales-
men for the reason that no two men
will talk to the same prospective cus-
tomer in the same language. The in-
tangible characteristics which I men-
tioned above enter at this point. The
salesman must have good judgment and
have the ability to find out the method
of approach that will apply to the man
on whom he is calling. My point is that
a man who simply takes his brief case
and goes from planj to plant, with only
the thought in his mind of his work and
making no attempt to analyze his cus-
tomer, will never become a high grade
man. It is naturally important, before
the first call is made, to attempt to de-
termine just how a certain man is to
be approached by the salesman, but
the salesman should know in any case
after he has shaken hands with the
prospective customer, the line of con-
versation that should follow. There are
as many different types of men as there
are men. Some like to talk sports, some
like to talk about their families, some
about their dogs, or any particular
hobby which they have. When the
salesman calls on his customer and
starts talking about his product, he
should watch to see that he keeps his
customer's interest. If interest is lack-
ing, the conversation must be changed
to something else and the salesman
must grope about until he finally hits
the vulnerable spot. There are some
men who make an interesting story out
of the equipment which they handle, a
point which is always quite important.
To simply describe your product with
dry conversation will not put it over.
In other words, you must have the abil-
ity to tell your story in an interesting
way. Enjoy your work enough to make
a romance out of it and you will click
every time.
When dealing with large customers
where it is necessary to follow the
manager, the purchasing department,
and the particular engineer who is di-
rectly interested in your equipment, it
is necessary for the salesman first to
obtain the confidence of the purchasing
department and convince them to a
great enough extent that he is handling
a high grade line of equipment, in order
that the Purchasing Agent will allow
him to get into the plant to see the
mechanical or electrical engineer. Often-
times, when he gets by the purchasing
department and sees the engineer who
is directly interested in his product, he
will receive evasive answers: that that

particular plant standardizes on some
other equipment, or that they are sorry
but because of reciprocal relations it is
necessary to place the business with
someone else, etc., etc.
From this, it can be seen that a sales-
man cannot be of the type that can be
easily discouraged. The man on whom
you are calling has been buying for
several years, a product similar to the
one you are selling, and, naturally, can
see no reason why he should make a
change and buy your product. Now, it
is up to the young sales engineer to fol-
low this man persistently and through
his efforts make this man appreciate
that it is to his interest to do business
with you and your company.
The operating engineer whom you
must contact is in most cases also a
college man, but his training since leav-
ing college has been entirely different
from yours. His main point in life is,
first, to install the best equipment his
company will buy at his recommenda-
tion, and, second, to keep that equip-
ment operating continuously at a low
cost. When this man recommends your
equipment, he is really recommending
you because he feels that when he buys
from you, his worries are over and that
is exactly what you must put over.
When you have landed the order, your
work has just begun, because you have
a very definite obligation to your cus-
tomer to see that the material is built
properly, shipped in time, mounted
correctly and kept running. If you do
this, your customer will fight for you.
It is necessary for the young sales
engineer to appreciate the fact that
when he is out in the field, the cus-
tomer's only way of judging his com-
pany is entirely through himself as the
representative. If the representative is
a high grade man who is conscientious
and gives service, the customer will be-
lieve that the company he represents is
a good one; but if he is not of that
type, the customer will not care to do
business with that company because he
will believe that either their equipment
is poor or they do not give good service.
Future and Permanency
There is still one more question in
your mind that must be settled before
you definitely decide to follow the com-
mercial end of engineering, and that is,
"What is the future, and how perma-
nent is this phase of the work?"
As mentioned before, the executives
of a company are always directly inter-
ested in sales, and I know I am not
exaggerating when I say that the man-
agement will know a new go-getter
salesman better than other men who
have been in the organization for years.
Why? Simply because your efforts di-
rectly affect the output of the plant and
even the directors and stockholders
know of the successful salesman in their
plant. During recessions in business
when departments are letting men out
to reduce costs, the sales department is
affected last. Remember, that in these
days when machinery is replacing so
many men, it cannot replace salesmen.
I believe, to settle the whole matter
of the sales question, we can say that
the word "Sales" is synonymous with
"Service," and if a man in his own
heart feels he is the type who desires to
serve the people with whom he comes
in contact, he will undoubtedly make a
good salesman.

$13,000,000,000 is a lot of money.
$270,000,000, though considerably less
than 13 billion, is also quite a hand-
some sum. These figures represent re-
spectively the approximate investment
in and taxation of the electric light and
power industry. "The power question,"
says the Vice-Chairman of the Federal
Power Commission, "has become a na-
tional issue. It directly concerns every
American household and every American
business. Our domestic comfort as well
as our national prestige depends upon
our working out a practical and con-
structive solution of the many problems
which it involves."
The question referred to is the prob-
lem of who shall own the power industry
—the government or private corpora-
tions? At this time when everyone is
aroused over the issue it might be worth-
while to attempt to analyze as briefly as
possible some of the salient factors of
the question.
The discussion quite readily lends it-
self to the following divisions: Present
Power Rates, Government Power, and
Regulation of Private Power. These
topics will be treated in successive issues
of The Technic, and three general
questions will be raised: Are present
electric power rates reasonable? Is gov-
ernment power a wise and necessary
policy? Is efficient regulation of private
electric utilities practicable?
A logical beginning is a discussion of
present rates inasmuch as they are the
basis of dissatisfaction, and, if unreason-
able or exhorbitant, it is only natural to
expect that something should be done
about it. Therefore the facts will be
weighed and it will be attempted to
decide first, whether the present rates
appear unreasonable, and, second, in
next month's issue, what government
ownership will or will not do for the
situation.
Every now and then some ambitious
politician advocating or condemning
public ownership collects a vast number
of power rates from different parts of

the country and sets out to prove some-
thing. About a year ago a national gov-
ernment commission conducted a survey
to do the same thing. What did it prove?
Nothing. Everyone with even a slight
knowledge of the subject knew before
the investigation began that there is a
wide variance in power rates through-
out the country, which was about the
only thing the commission's survey
showed. Why? Differences in taxes, costs
of coal, labor, materials of construction
and numerous other similar differences
in local conditions.
For example, the national average
monthly consumption of electric power
as found by the U. S. Census Bureau is
51 kilowatt hours. The national average
rate per kilowatt hour is 5.5 cents. Com-
bining these two, the average monthly
power bill is $2.81. Now an advocate or
critic of private ownership can startle
his audience one way or the other by
judiciously picking his cities. For in-
stance the defender of private power
plants is bound to point out that the
average monthly consumption of 51 kilo-
watt hours would cost $8.37 if pur-
chased from the municipal plant at
Tombstone, Arizona. Moreover he would
emphasize that the municipal plants at
Groton, Conn.; Lakeland, Fla.; Cairo,
Ga.; and Seguin, Tex., charge respec-
tively $5.07, $6.63, $5.10, and $6.10 for
the same quantity of electricity. All
these bills are considerably more than
the national average of $2.81. No doubt
too, our friend of the private utilities
would incidently remind us that the
privately owned plants of Union, S. C;
Danbury, Conn.; St. Louis, Mo.; and
Washington, D. C, give 51 kilowatt
hours for only $2.54, $2.73, $1.98, and
$1.99, all of which are below the average
cost. The advocate of government own-
ership would come right back at him
however, and point with pride to the
municipal plants of Seattle, Wash.;
Springfield, 111.; Colorado Springs,
Colo.; and Jacksonville, Fla., which
charge, mind you, only $2.42, $2.34,
$3.06, and $3.25. Choose your side and
pick your figures accordingly. In any
case "the average householder today
spends less than 10 cents a day for all
the electric power he uses to light his
home and operate numerous home ap-
pliances—less than he spends for cigar-
ettes."1
Another frequent complaint is that
"the capital structure of American busi-
ness and utilities is top heavy, etc., etc."
He goes on to show how the consumer
suffers because of high rates due to this
"vast over-capitalization." It is prob-

utilities, like all businesses, were greatly
overcapitalized during the boom years
of the 1920-'30 era, but to contend that
this adversely affects the rates paid by
the consumer is erroneous. "Capitaliza-
tion . . . has never been given any sub-
stantial weight as a rate base factor in
a single important rate case before
Federal courts in the last fifteen years.
Capitalization has been considered by a
few state commissions, but only for com-
parative purposes and as a handy check-
up figure for original cost investment
data. . . "2
Accusations of ''watered stock" and
its dire effect on power rates forms a
large part of the repertoire of the op-
ponents of privately owned power. In
one rate case the commission said, "it is
of no interest to a state commission, as
far as rate making is concerned, whether
a utility stock is watered or whether the
utility is overbonded, or whether all of
the return deemed fair goes for interest,
since the return is calculated solely upon
the fair value of the company's prop-
erty used and useful for proper rendi-
tion of service."3
Much of the hue and cry over electric
power rates is caused because the con-
sumers electric power bill has increased
constantly since 1914. The alert poli-
tician immediately jumps up and shouts,
"this conclusively proves that the 'pee-
pul' are being grossly exploited by the
power interests." To show the absurdity
of this contention it is only necessary to
point out that since 1914 the average
rate has dropped 33%. At the present
time electricity costs are 37% below the
1913 average of prices while the cost of
living is 35% above that average (U.S.
Census and Labor Bureau statistics—
1932 report). Chart I serves to bring
out this true state of affairs quite clearly
and simply.
In 1914 the rate was 8.3 cents per
kilowatt hour and at the present time
is about 5.26. However at the 1914 rate
the average American paid $22.50 for
domestic service that year, while in
1932 the same average American was
paying $34 a year for domestic service.
It is easy to see, therefore how John Q.
Public is often downright angry to find
that he is paying more now than before
rates were supposed to be reduced. What
he often fails to appreciate is that he

has used his money to buy about 50%
more electricity, and consequently gets
the impression that he is being cheated
and hoodwinked. Needless to say, when
a citizen is in that frame of mind, he is
very sympathetic to suggestions of pub-
lic ownership advocates who will claim
that state regulation has broken down
and that government power means
cheaper electricity and lower bills. These
high-sounding promises suffer, however,
when we remind our consumer that 1932
Census figures show that in that year
municipal plants produced less than 6%
of the country's total horsepower and
obtained only about 6% of the total
revenues from electric service. Rate
charges by municipal plants averaged
3.1 cents per kilowatt hour as against
2.7 cents for commercial plants even
without deducting for the tremendous
tax burden of the latter. It is plain

American dollar.
therefore that commercial plants not
only furnished 94% of the service but
did it at a lower average rate.
The relation of power rates to the
other items of the family budget is
shown clearly by chart II and needs no
comment except to point out that the
"heavy burden" borne by the electric
power consumer as contrasted to his
burden as a taxpayer seems out of
proportion to all the fuss raised by the
politicians over the former.
What never ceases to amaze is the
attitude of the present administration in
Washington. Chart II shows that, with
the exception of taxes, food is the largest
single item on the family budget. More-
over one can live without electricity, but
it becomes increasingly embarrassing to
live without nutriment. Nevertheless the
National Government has done every-
thing, from hog-killing to bribing the
farmers not to grow crops, in a con-
certed effort to raise the prices of food-
stuffs, and at th
terrible hullabal
rates. As one as

ave you ever been awakened at an
y morning hour by a brilliant red
poking its head up over a snow-
*ed mountain? That is the way a
is begun at Camp Davis, the Uni-
ity of Michigan surveying camp
ted in the Jackson's Hole country,

Hoback stretches out ahead like a
■n carpet laid between two mountain
*es. The sparkling river tumbling
ig the floor of the valley beckons
1 a promise of a summer's work and
/ that will be long remembered,
'he camp itself, situated in the val-
just south of the Wind River Range,
deally located for surveying. The
topography of the surrounding country
is such that there are level planes,
gentle slopes, and jagged mountains, all
within walking distance. These fea-
tures, combined with an excellent teach-
ing staff, have made the University of
Michigan camp one of the most widely
recognized in its field. The summer's
program includes all types of survey-
ing, from bridge location to work with
the sextant.
The camp community center consists
of twenty-nine cabins, with an instru-
ment house, garage, power plant, care-
takers house, and short-wave radio
station. Not of least importance are the
meals, particularly breakfast—cereal,
fruit, three or four glasses of milk,
bacon and eggs, and then to top it off,

Since no story of life at Camp Davis

must be said about that thriving me-

principal attractions are the weekly
barn dance with its cow-poker orches-

theater with its front row of wooden

notorious reputation in its earlier days,

sen field of
neering, then
nay truly say
he has ac-
plished some-
ig noteworthy.
h a student is
pert Bell, Rupert Bell
irman of the local chapter of the
E.E. Rupert has always enjoyed
erimenting in laboratories and dur-
his first two years on the campus
was an assistant in physics at Ann
•or High School. Since then he has
ted his lab work to the machine
p in the East Engineering building
has taken to making model elec-
al and combustion engines. This
avk was so interesting to Rup that he

pas out many interesting models in
*e&lt; leisure time. His most recent model,
iswo cylinder gasoline engine, has a
itttl weight of 7 pounds, develops about
teiH.P. at 5000 R.P.M. has a ll/»
)nh bore and a 1 inch stroke. Bell is
o\ng this engine for experiments on ig-
ion and carburetion, the two major
Acuities encountered in model com-
e ition.
vr3ecause of the high scholastic record
Rhas maintained, and because of the
tiial gentleman, Bell was elected to
11 u Beta Pi as a junior and is now re-
diding secretary of that organization.
o y popularity among his fellow seniors
e :videnced by his election to the office
avice-president of his class.

s past record shows that few difficul-
will hamper his future work.
SKIPPER
As the son of a Great Lakes skipper,
we do not feel surprised when Jim
Goodrich says that he enjoys life on the
water. Even with an opportunity to
realize his desire, Goodrich soon decided
that life as a common seaman would be
very dull. Then he decided that he
would enjoy the work of a marine law-
yer and so he came to Ann Arbor and
started in our course in Naval Architec-
ture and Marine Engineering. Today,
as a senior, Jim looks towards the Law
Quadrangle where he has decided to
spend the next three years in prepara-
tion for his future profession.
Due to lack of funds, Goodrich has
worked his way through the Engineer-
ing College and hence has had slight
time to engage in extra-curricular activ-
ities. In spite of this fact, he is purser
of the Quarter-
deck society, and
a company com-
mander in the
R. O. T. C. Fur-
ther recognition
was his election
into Scabbard and
Blade, national
honorary military
fraternity.
In the summer
Jim has the pleas-
ant job of waterfront director at a girls'
camp and spends most of his time on
the water, he says—? With June and
graduation Jim will leave the Engineer-
ing College but not the campus and it
is highly probable that he will be seen
quite frequently around the West En-
gine building next year.
At the present time, Jim is actively
engaged in the shallow water research
work that is being carried on in the
University Naval Tank. Shallow water
conditions in the tank are made possible
by the new adjustable bottom which can
be raised or lowered to any desired
depth. On page four of this issue of the
TECHNIC, Goodrich presents a very in-
teresting and comprehensive account of
the work, calling attention to the par-
ticular problems and peculiarities of
shallow water navigation.
James Goodrich
SINGER
The engineering profession gives a
man plenty of chances to use his lusty
lungs but we'll wager that few engi-
neers use them to gain distinction in
singing. However, Herbert Goldswor-
thy is quite an exception to the average
engineer. He started engineering courses
at Washington University in his home
city, St. Louis. After three years there,
Herb decided to further his education
by coming to Ann Arbor for a while
and is now spending his third year on
the engineering campus. His course in
Chemical and Industrial Engineering
has shared time with his activities as a
singer. With three years of experience
in a college glee club before coming
here, it was no trick at all for Herb to
become a member of the Michigan Glee
Club and his fine work there is evi-
denced by his election to the presidency
of the organization last year. Herb says
that music is still his real hobby in spite
of the evidence that it seems to be los-
ing ground temporarily to the current
"Monopoly" craze. He has already suc-
ceeded in selling the game to one of the
members of the engineering faculty.
Probably Goldsworthy is best known
on the campus as the originator and
mainstay of the "Four Men of Note"
whom we have all heard at one time or
another. This quartet has become lo-
cally famous and Herb is at present
booking engagements for a tour of the
east during spring vacation.
His activities are not entirely limited
to music as he is president of the local
chapter of the A.I.Ch.E. Goldsworthy
is also president of Alpha Epsilon Mu
and house manager of his fraternity,
Alphi Chi Sigma.
Herb has spent
five summers in
various summer
schools and six
years in engineer-
ing colleges so
we are sure hop-
ing that he will
find that nice
sunny spot in
California where
he is longing to
work.

LETS SNAP OUT OF IT
Much as we hate to admit it, the en-
ar pneers on this campus have no reputa-
rse in
win:
as i
ion
aon as economists. The reason becomes
juite evident upon sitting in on one of
Professor Peterson's famous "Economics
for Engineers" courses in the little gray
building in the center of the campus.
The prevailing attitude of the audience
s seems to convey some suggestion of mis-
■ understanding as to the importance of
Professor Peterson's messages to the
l;' members of the engineering fraternity.
Why must the engineer wait until he
, gets out on the job, with his half-con-
l , sumed opportunities strewn far behind
him, before he will realize the import-
^ ance of economics and business training
'in his field of endeavor? It is a well
known fact that a large number of en-
gineers eventually work into the manag-
ing and administrative end of business
enterprises. A larger number—we might
even say those remaining—are con-
cerned at least indirectly with the econ-
omical considerations of the companies
which they serve. Does it not seem
wiser, then, to make our attitude toward
"our college economics courses one of
1 genuine desire to learn rather than one
'of mere tolerance?
Why have the golden dreams of so
many engineers ended up in bank-
ruptcy? Simply because the brain be-
hind the idea lacked that important
little quality called economic sense. But
it has not been uncommon for econ-
omically sound ideas to be put away as
business failures after an actual trial.
The trouble in such cases is usually lack
of knowledge of the principles of busi-
ness enterprise. For want of such train-
ing and understanding, even the distin-
guished builders of towering skyscrapers
have gone astray.
While we are yet in college we have
the best chance of our lives to learn the
principles of economics and business.
But what do we do? We try barely to
skin through the required courses, in
economics, and when we do finally
make it, thank our lucky stars that no-
body is going to make us take any more
of the darned stuff. The faculty is do-
ing its part; it is our own attitude that
is standing in the way. Let's wake up
and grab the opportunity to get this
stuff while we can. To use a legal
phrase, we have been "sleeping on our
rights." There is the School of Business
Administration which offers to engineers
a number of excellent courses as non-
technical electives.

that the entrepreneur, the economist,
and the engineer work together. Indi-
vidually each is master of his own pro-
fession, but not to the exclusion of an
understanding of the importance of the
job of each of the others. To the en-
gineer, a working knowledge of econ-
omics and business principles means a
more secure job in a more stable com-
pany and dollars in the pocket.

WHEN THE LICHTS CO OUT
(From fhe New York Times)
A short circuit and fire in the Hell
Gate plant cripples subway trains at the
peak of the traffic and plunges New
York into darkness from Sixtieth Street
to the Harlem River for some six hours.
The incident carries with it a striking
social lesson . . . The New York Edison
Company draws upon the electrical re-
sources of its own stations and those of
the Niagara Hudson Company. It is
the modern mass character of energy
that is driven home by New York's mis-
hap. A short circuit—and the organic
life of a great city is slackened for a few
hours. Back we drift to the eighteenth
century, to burn candles and to realize
what we owe to the physicists and the
engineers who have made energy col-
lective and who transform the city into
a blaze of light when the sun goes down.
How utterly dependent we are on the
engineers! They and the scientists hold
us in the hollow of their hand. How
many of them are there? A hundred
thousand, a million—who knows? They
constitute a new ruling class. Destroy
them and the country would be laid
low. Disease would decimate us, trans-
portation would be impossible, tele-
phone and telegraph would be silent,
starvation would stalk in the cities, fac-
tories would stand idle. Technocracy?
The term is in bad odor. But there are
technocrats for all that—knights not of
the sword but of energy. When the
lights go out we become aware of our
rulers.
-ooo-
HERE'S WHAT IT TAKES
Just what happens when a large com-
pany is born is usually somewhat of a
mystery to the average person.
During the World War, American
dyestuffs and organic chemicals imports
were seriously threatened by foreign
embargoes. The Administration at
Washington was seeking new ways and
means of building up an organic chem-
ical industry in this country in order
to bring to an end the deplorable de-
pendence upon foreign countries for
materials of such importance as these.
DuPont considered the opportunity
and decided to take a chance. It was
necessary to construct plants to pro-
duce these products immediately and on
a broad front. The money invested
was considerable; the losses were heavy.
At the end of the first five years the
duPont Company had invested in this
industry, in plants and working capital,
$22,000,000, and in addition to that
had suffered operating losses to the ex-
tent of $18,000,000, making, to that
date, a total outlay of $40,000,000
without a cent of profit. The invest-
ment has been increased in large meas-
ure in the thirteen years since that time.

THE SHOOTING OF BADGER BAKER McCASE
With Apologies to Robert Service
A bunch of the boys were whoopin' it up,
In Charlie's old back room;
The kid that fussed with the radio,
Would be gettin' some music soon,
And back in a corner, playin' bridge
Sat Badger Baker McCase;
And soused by his side was his light o'love,
And up her sleeve was an ace.
When out of the night, which was 90 above,
And into the gin in the air,
There stumbled a stude, dog tired he was
With bluebooks all over his hair.
And he told us a tale, hair raisin' it was,
Of P Chem, 9a and 9b,
And the horrors they got him whenever he spoke,
And his eyes they glared at me.
There was none could remember who he was,
Though we knew we'd seen his face,
But we drank his health, and the last to drink
Was Badger Baker McCase.
It seems that he'd been a freshman once,
A carefree lad and gay,
But they wrangled him into Ch E, and
And his hair turned old and gray;
He sat and talked in an old cracked voice,
Talked—I'll say he raved,
How he'd worked and sweated for paltry C's;
Worked—I'll say he'd slaved.
Then as he raved in his thin old voice,
Fast, like running a race,
His eyes swung around and he horribly frowned,
At Badger Baker McCase.
Then his voice it raised to a piercing shriek,
And blood dripped from his nose,
And he frothed and foamed and softly moaned,
As he rent and ripped his clothes;
He howled and screamed like a man half mad,
The gore oozed down his face,
Then his eyes took on a devilish gleam,
"One heart," says Badger McCase,
He shook his fist at the table of four
And jumped up from his place
And he dragged out a gun with a long black
snout,
"Two hearts," says Badger McCase;
Two shots rang out like the clap o'doom
And two men fell on their face,
One I regret was the screaming stude, the other.
Badger Baker McCase.
Those then are the facts of the shootin'
'Cause I was there to see
And some say 'twas right and just,
Twas simply fated to be.
A DEFINITION
A girl in a western technical school is reported as defin-
ing a bolt and nut as follows:
"A bolt is a thing like a stick of hard metal such as iron,
with a square bunch of windings on one end and a lot of
scratchings wound around the other end. A nut is similar
to the bolt, only just the opposite, being a hole in a chunk
of iron sawed off short, with wrinkles around the inside."
"Hello, is this the weather bureau?"
"Uh huh."
"How about a shower this afternoon?"
"I dunno, if you need one, take it." —Shamrock ooo
"Let me show you something new in a snappy sedan,"
said the auto salesman.
"It won't do you a bit of good," she replied, "and I don't
think you could anyway." —Kansas Engineer
A TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION
A young lady recently visited the locomotive works and
then later told some of her friends how a locomotive is
made.
"You pour a lot of sand into a lot of boxes," she ex-
plained, "and you throw old stove lids and things into a
furnace, and then you empty the molten stream into a hole
in the sand, and everybody yells and swears. Then you
pour it out and let it cool and pound it, and then you put
it in a thing that bores holes in it. Then you screw it to-
gether, and paint it, and put steam in it, and they take it
to a drafting-room and make a blueprint of it. But one
thing I forgot—they have to make a boiler. One man gets
inside and one man remains outside, and they pound fright-
fully; and they tie it to the other thing, and you ought to
see it go!" —New York University Quadrangle

Practically All Commercial Metals and Alloys
By A. B. KINZEL*
One great advantage of using
welding is that practically every
commercially available metal and
alloy can be made by this means
into a jointless assembly.
Contributes to Home
Comforts
Numerous articles fabricated
by welding are found in most
homes. Familiar ones cover a
wide range of metals—kitchen
ware and furniture of aluminum,
copper and stainless steel; copper
tubing in refrigerators, sheet
metal in refrigerator boxes;
kitchen cabinets and gas ranges;
^ater pipes of copper, brass, iron
and steel; furnaces and hot water
tanks of strong heat-resisting
irons and steels. Even the tiny
alloy wire elements in radio
tubes arc welded.
Simplifies Automobile
Maintenance
Automobile manufacturers use
welding for innumerable assem-
blies where your safety and com-
fort depend on permanent strength
and tightness. The modern auto-
mobile repair man also uses weld-
ing. With welding he quickly re-
stores broken parts to use again.
Steel bumpers, fenders, frames arc
readily made jointless by weld-
ing—as strong as or stronger than
the original piece. Cracked cylin-
der blocks and broken aluminum
crank cases are welded. Valves
and valve seats are made service
free by welding a thin coating of
Haynes Stellite to the wearing
surfaces to give longer life and
added thousands of low cost miles.
Aids Industrial Users
In industry — for tanks, con-
tainers, piping and a wide variety
of other machinery and equip-
ment of all sizes, shapes and
metals—the use of welding is
even more extensive.
Welding Marches Ahead
The wide-spread use of weld-
ing for various metals and alloys
has been due largely to constant
advances in technique and mate-
rials. Typical among these is the
development of Lindewelding, a
procedure for the rapid welding
of steel pipe and plate. Speed in-
creases of 50 to 65 per cent and
material savings of 25 to 50 per
cent over previous methods have
been made.
Bronze-welding, welding with
a bronze welding rod, is widely
used for both repair and produc-
tion. Smooth joining of metals or
alloys of different compositions
can be accomplished by bronze-
welding. Steel can be bronze-

welded to cast iron, bronze and
copper can be joined, brass and
steel plate can be united.
Makes Modern Metal Designs
Jointless
Exact procedures for the weld-
ing of corrosion-resistant steels
and alloys have been developed.
Welds so made are sound, strong
and ductile. Resistance of the
welded joint to corrosion makes
it valuable also for use in joining
special alloys such as Monel
Metal and Everdur. Welded alu-
minum alloy chairs, tables and
other furniture have been made
possible through the develop-
ment of special aluminum weld-
ing rods.

Professor of Electrical Engineering,
Head Freshman Mentor since 1927, and
inventor (his latest, the famed "Hydro-
car), Arthur Dearth Moore is one of
the men who comprise the backbone of
Michigan's Engineering Staff. The nine
years of weekly Wednesday assemblies
with the embryo engineers may be the
reason that this deep-voiced gentleman
is so youthful at 41.
Raised and educated an Easterner,
graduated from Uniontown, Pennsylva-
nia in 1911 and Carnegie Institute of
Technology with a B.S.(E.E.) in 1915,
Professor Moore first came to the Uni-

Richard H. Berryman, junior mechan-
ical engineer, is completing his second
year at the left wing position on Michi-
gan's varsity hockey team.
Coming from Cass Technical High
School in Detroit, where he played with
the city hockey champions for two
years, Berryman matriculated at Mich-
igan in 1933. Dur-
ing his first year he
won numerals in
both hockey and
baseball. Last year
he was honored with
a namesake, the
Berryman A. C., a
sextet which came
out on top at the
end of the Intramu-
ral hockey season.
Professionally, Dick is interested in
the sales end of the heating and ventil-
ating industry, and if the breezes he
makes on the ice are any indication of
his future activities, there will be no
stopping him.
In the spring of 1935 Triangles saw
fit to initiate this puck-hurling engi-
neer, at which time he also became a
member of the "M" Club.
The recent trip of the hockey team
to the wilds of the northern peninsula
gave Dick the rare opportunity of re-
visiting his birthplace, Painesdale, ten
miles from Houghton, Michigan. In the
game with Michigan School of Mines,
Dick showed the home folks how hockey
is played in the southern part of the
state.
PROFESSOR BADGER ACTIVE ON

Besides supervising the rebuilding
and general overhauling of the Cleve-
land Cliffs Company at Marquette,
Michigan, for the Dow Chemical Com-
pany, Prof. Walter L. Badger of the
Chemical Engineering Department, on
leave of absence last semester, also
made two lecture trips. In early De-
cember he toured the Middle West,
going as far south as Kentucky. Christ-
mas vacation found Professor Badger
lecturing in the East, stopping at Cor-
nell, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute
and others. His speeches were made
before the American Chemical Societies
of the various schools at which he

Think?
Question: Can better engineering solve the
traffic problem?
Answer: by Roger L. Morrison, Pro-
fessor of Highway Engineering and High-
way Transport.
The answer to the question, "Can
better engineering solve the traffic prob-
lem?" is, "No.'' Should the question be
changed to read. "Can the traffic prob-
lem be solved without better engineer-
ing?", the answer would again be,
"Xo.'? The solution of the problem
appears to depend primarily upon what
have come to be known as the three
''E's" of traffic control—Engineering,
Enforcement, and Education. Only
where all three have been conducted
with a high degree of efficiency has the
battle against traffic hazards and con-
gestion been successful.
The best engineering efforts are more
or less ineffective, unless the traffic
laws are strictly enforced and unless
thare is an intensive and continuous
campaign of safety education in the
schools and among the citizens general-
ly. On the other hand, strict enforce-
ment and intensive education cannot
reduce accidents to a minimum and
keep traffic flowing smoothly without
competent engineering.
The handling of highway traffic safe-
ly and expeditiously is essentially an
engineering problem. It involves street
plans, the installation of traffic signals
and other traffic control devices, the im-
provement of street lighting in some
cases, the protection of railroad cross-
ings and many other things of a strictly
engineering character.
Many police departments compile ex-
cellent accident records but it usually
takes an engineering background to
make a proper analysis of the records
and determine what remedies should be
applied. "Collision diagrams" are
drawn for hazardous intersections show-
ing the nature of each accident and the
time it occurred. "Condition diagrams"
are also drawn showing the location of
all signs, signals, buildings, fences.
trees and other items which are at or
near the intersection, and might be a
factor in accidents. A study of these
(diagrams will often indicate clearly a
removable cause of accidents, or ob-
servations of the actual intersection,
both in the daytime and at night, may
be required.

A.I.CH.E. PROBLEM
It was decided at the last meeting of the A.I.Ch.E. that
the annual chemical engineering problem competition spon-
sored by that organization will be held during the last two
weeks in April and the first week in May. Statement of
the problem may be obtained from Prof. \V. L. McCabe at
that time. "All undergraduate students of chemical en-
gineering are eligible for entry," stated Professor McCabe.
"and it is urged that as many as possible submit solutions
because the winning of any one of the awards usually means
a good send-off in the field." The problem this year will be
in the nature of a rather elaborate quantitative design
calculation. It will be noticed that the time limit has been
extended to three weeks, as against two weeks in previous
years. The judges for the local competition will pick not
more than three of the best solutions from this school for
submission to the National Committee, who will determine
the final prize-winners in the national competition. The
awards will consist of a first prize of $100, second prize of
$50, and third prize of $25. The solutions from this school
which are sent to the National Committee will receive an
award of $5 each from the local A.I.Ch.E. chapter.
SALERMO RETORT-A NEW CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
UNIT
The Salermo Retort is a simple device initially used for
the continuous production of oil from coal and other min-
erals which contain oil. It consists of a number of semi-
circular troughs from 12 to 18 inches in diameter bolted
side by side to produce as long a unit as desired. Along
the axis of each trough is a steel shaft carrying a number
of paddles which rotate. The material to be carbonised is
fed in at one end, and the action of the paddles causes it
to travel to the other end. The troughs are covered and
heat is applied to remove the desired constituent.
The unit has found increasing application as a drier and
mixer. Its drying operation is obvious. As a mixer the
paddles, the movement from trough to trough, and a cir-
culatory motion in the space between troughs cause very
satisfactory mixing.
AIR CONDITIONING AND MOISTURE CONTROL
IN PAPER WORK
So much has been printed recently under the heading of
air conditioning that one is apt to be misled by this name.
Complete air conditioning includes control of temperature,
humidity, and motion of air in both summer and winter.
In many instances units controlling only humidity are satis-
factory while other situations demand constant tempera-
tures. In paper testing, complete air condition is required
since paper is a hygroscopic substance and since the proper-
ties of paper are appreciably affected by moisture content.
Fluctuations in temperature and humidity are being elim-
inated in several plants either where paper is manufactured
or where it is used. In lithographing establishments espe-
cially these conditions are controlled since the sheet may be
run through the press a number of times in color work and
should the relative humidity increase, causing the paper to
eNpand. the sheet would be badly off register.

THE Department of Mechanism and Engineering Drawing occupies the entire long hallway of the
fourth floor of West Engineering Building. It has nine combined recitation and drawing rooms,
five office rooms, a library, model room, storage, filing, and shipping room for drawing exercise
sheets, a wood working shop, research laboratory, and the University's Blue Printing facilities. The
Department staff of eleven teach the three subjects of the total course in the graphical language of
the engineer, Engineering Drawing, together with special courses for Business Administration, Den-
tistry, and Engineering-Law. The Department assists all of the ten Junior Colleges of the State with
course outlines, charts, and exercise sheets. It provides such service also for all of the Junior Colleges
of Chicago, and numerous colleges in other States; California, New Mexico, Montana, North Dakota,
Missouri, and New York.
The total enrollment in the various subjects of Engineering Drawing is approximately seven hun-
dred each semester. Classes are limited insofar as possible to from fifteen to twenty students and the
methods of visual education are applied to the limit of their utility. Of necessity the major portion of
the students' time is devoted to the acquisition of a thorough working mastery of the language of
Engineering Drawing. Modern engineering methods have rendered the one-time Art of Engineering
Drawing relatively obsolete.

CRASH!
TT'S a thunderstorm sweeping over Pittsfield,
Massachusetts. But G-E engineers, instead of
hiding under the hed, go up on the roof to he nearer
the lightning. On one of the buildings of the Pittsfield
Works they have built and equipped a lightning
observatory. By means of an ingenious periscope
and a high-speed, motor-driven camera, any light-
ning flash occurring within many miles—north,
south, east, or west—can be automatically photo-
graphed. Its characteristics, as recorded on the film,
can then be compared with those of the artificial
flashes produced by the 10,000,000-volt lightning
generator in the laboratory.
An observatory has to have a hole in the roof.
This causes astronomers no embarrassment, because
they can work only in clear weather. But with
lightning observers it is different -when there is
lightning there is also rain. So, to keep the rain
from falling on the 12 lenses of the new camera —
and from running down the engineers' necks—com-
pressed air is blown upward through the aperture.
When next the thunder rolls over the Berkshires,
and timid citizens are cowering under the bedclothes,
these General Electric engineers will be up on the
roof taking elaborate notes on Jove's own brand of
lightning.

TROUBLED! Redoubled! North led, but the

flew thick and fast when a North American contract-

played a "bridgecast" tournament with a high-
ranking team from Argentina. The North Americans
were seated on the stage of Rice Hall in the General
Electric Company, at Schenectady, N. Y., while
the Argentine team played at the Casabal Club in
Buenos Aires. The plays were carried by the short-
wave stations W2XAF and LSX, of North and
South America, respectively.
W2XAF, in Schenectady, used a feed-back circuit
so that short-wave listeners all over the world,
tuned to the one station, could follow the playing
with as great ease as the 500 kibitzers who jammed
Rice Hall. This was the first international bridge
broadcast in which the principals were all recog-
nized experts. The North American team, captained
by Culbertson, won by a margin of 1030 points.

Adequate street lighting is, of course, a necessity.
G-E illumination engineers have perfected a new-

on the street—and keeps it from trespassing on the

designed along new optical lines have removed
street lamps from the list of public enemies of sleep.

A TRIUMPH OF CHEMISTRY
More than a century has passed
since magnesium was first recog-
nized as an oxide of metal and later pro-
duced as a metal.
It is also a matter of record that out of
Germany came the first large scale pro-
duction of magnesium alloys—a devel'
opment of the World War.
A group of typical Dowmetal
castings
But, should the history of this lightest
of all structural alloys be written, The Dow Chemical
Company of Midland, Michigan, would occupy a
singular and honored place.
For, aside from being the sole producer of magnesium
alloys in this country, it is to the everlasting credit of
Dow chemists and technicians that this valuable metal
is now produced at a price making it available to all
industry.
Today, under the trade name of Dowmetal, Dow
magnesium alloys are bringing the great benefits of
lightness combined with toughness and strength to
countless products.
Being a full third lighter than aluminum and only a
quarter the weight of steel, it is obvious that the air-
craft industry became its first big user. Engine crank-
cases, landing wheels and many other
parts, large and small, are made of Dow-
metal. The recent stratosphere explora-
tions were made in Dowmetal gondolas.
Beginning there, the list broadens from
machinery to household appliances —
from truck bodies to camera parts, port-
able power tools, typewriters and a host
of other applications.
In addition to producing a range of alloys, Dow offers
a complete pre-fabrication service covering castings,
forgings, sheets, plates and extruded shapes. In addi-
tion, an engineering and technical staff is available
to cooperate with users in the practical and efficient
application of Dowmetal to their products or
equipment.
The commercial development of Dowmetal symbolizes
and parallels the successful 45-year history of The Dow
Chemical Company.
Manufacturing 250 separate and distinct products, The
Dow Chemical Company has risen to a respected
leadership through constructive and original research
and the fundamental objective of applying chemistry
as a means of making valuable materials cost less.

Supervisor of Personnel Research
The Detroit Edison Company
Detroit. Michigan
A busy plant superintendent and the
employment interviewer of a large com-
pany were on the campus interviewing
several engineering college seniors as
possible recruits for a two-year plant
training course. The personal history
card and scholarship of one John Doson
looked quite satisfactory to the critical
pair. Doson had been recommended by
one of the Mechanical and one of the
Electrical Professors. When Doson ap-
peared, the first impression he made on
both men was not 100 per cent, but
they had trained themselves to apply
large safety factors to first impressions.
The interview was progressing nicely
when, to an incidental question asked
by the superintendent, "By the way, do
you know whether Professor Bailer is
in town?" Doson replied, "Yes, he is.
I seen him in his office as I passed by
ten minutes ago." Believe it or not,
because of one word in that fatal sen-
tence, Doson was not offered a job. And
if that word does not stand out like a
sore thumb to you, some interviewer
may also pass you by.
"But," say you, "that's not engineer-
ing! If a firm is satisfied with the tech-
nical subjects I've studied and my
grades, with the experience I had in
two summer jobs, and with my
personal appearance, isn't that
enough? I'm not so sure I want
to work for an outfit that's so
fussy they turn down a good pros-
pect because he 'seen? instead of
'saw' a man."
Perhaps you are right. But you
have to take these employers as
they come. And some are the
•'seen-saw" kind. However, on this
we can agree: industrial employ-
ers and representatives vary in
what they consider to be important
qualifications for success on a job.
And, if they should agree on qualifica-
tions, they will differ in their methods
of determining whether an applicant
measures up to them.
But in spite of the diversity of opin-
ion and approach there seems to be
rather general agreement that there are
some important traits or qualities which
are often missing or poorly developed in
the engineering graduate. Two of these
lacks or deficiencies will be considered
in some detail. Others will merely be
mentioned.
Getting Along With People
Two fellows, Tom and Jerry, were
roommates during their years in engi-
neering college. Tom was an honor stu-
dent, brilliant and very promising. He
was not interested in people and their
ways and was not very popular. Jerry
rated about C plus in his studies, but
enjoyed being with people and making
friends.
Both were hired by the same employ-
er. Their training was of the rotational
sort, a year being spent doing or ob-
serving the work of several divisions.
Much of
struction.
the work was outdoor con-
Neither built nor operated by formula alone
On the job Tom felt very much in the
way at times. He was interested in the
technical aspects of the work, but not
in the casual conversations and actions
of the men. Somewhat vague but un-
favorable reports about Tom came back
to the superintendent. Jerry, on the
other hand, was having a great time
with the workmen. In return for his
pleasant wholesome manner and his de-
sire to keep busy, the men gave him
many interesting and valuable bits of
training and advice. The superintend-
ent's office received many favorable re-
ports about Jerry. After the year's
training both men were placed in the
designing division. The contacts Tom
had to make were fewer than in the
field, and it was hoped that he migHt
develop into an expert designer. But
here also his inability to get along with
the few people with whom he had fre-
quently to confer, was largely responsi-
ble for his final separation from the
company after about a year's trial at
the design board. Jerry is still with the
department, is liked by everyone, has
been given a supervisor's position, and
is in line for something better.
You may say that Tom was not
cut out for that sort of work and
(he earlier he found it out the bet-
ter. Why try to change his inborn
traits?
The question as to what traits
are inborn and what are acquired
is far from settled. And if you
have built up a certain pattern of
thinking or acting over ten or
twenty years it does not matter
much whether it is due to nature
or nurture. The job of changing
that habit pattern is an exceeding-
MARCH, 1936


many of you are going to have to do it.
There are very few engineering jobs
of the hermit type. In most of the work
of the world it is necessary to get along
with people, every one of whom is dif-
ferent. They have different back-
grounds, different viewpoints, different
objectives, different prejudices, different
likes and dislikes. You can "go places"
without bothering about the other fel-
low and his opinions but you will not
go nearly so far and the journey will
not be nearly so pleasant.
Some of you want to become super-
visors, superintendents, leaders of men.
If so, you must first learn how and
why men think and act as they do.
Ability to supervise people is not some-
thing you can acquire by reading a
book thei night before you start super-
vising. It is a technique and an art
far more complex than engineering. It
takes years of study and practice. One
of our supervisors recently said, "I can
get any number of engineers for thirty-
five dollars a week to do the technical
work of the department but when I
look for a good foreman it's quite an-
other matter."
One department head says, "The
boys for whom we find a place and pro-
motion are the ones who respect the
other fellow's viewpoints and rights, and
who get down to the level of the work-
man." Another supervisor, conscious of
the same problem with some of the
young engineers who come to him, but
not knowing just what the lack is, says,
"The college ought to teach them psy-
chology or something."
What can you do about it? Here's a
suggestion. If you are convinced that
ability to get along with people is a
desirable and valuable asset, then study
people, consciously, intentionally. And
be sure to include yourself in your
study. When you, your roommate, a
"Prof," the girl friend, a stranger, a
character in a book, does something
which surprises, pleases, displeases, or
leaves you unaffected, ask yourself,
"How does he get that way?" But ask
it intelligently, respectfully, imperson-
ally, as a scientist would ask it. In
yourself, continuously, and in others,
with your every contact, you have a
well-equipped laboratory for the study
of human nature. Why not use it?
Straight Thinking
That most of the work of the world
is done jointly, and not individually,
may be news to you. The suggestion
that you study people and their ways
if you would get along with them, may
be new to you but it should not sur-
prise you. For are you not a scientist?
Let's see. Are you?
If you are a scientist, you should
know what the scientific method is,
its several steps, its technique. Can
you, an engineer, define the scientific
method, or the synonymous terms—the
research method, the engineering meth-
od, straight-thinking?
In all of your engineering courses you
are applying the scientific method. You
use it for four years. For those engi-
neers who learn the method as a meth-
od, industry, business, and society are
SUMMER WORK
What part does summer employ-
ment play in the scheme of college
engineering training? What is the
employer's attitude toward the
subject? What types of summer
work are available and which
should be considered by the un-
dergraduate engineer?
A general discussion of this
timely subject will be presented
next month by Mr. Frank J. Oli-
ver, Industrial Coordinator at the
University of Detroit. The article
will be the sixth in the series on
employment.
finding interesting and remunerative
positions in many non-engineering
fields. So we find the engineer succeed-
ing in finance, sales, law, administra-
tion, management, statesmanship. How-
ever, such men are not succeeding be-
cause they are engineers in the sense
that they once learned calculus, chem-
istry, and mechanics. It is because such
men, when they studied those and other
engineering subjects, caught on to and
made part of their thinking a method
which they find applicable to all prob-
lems, of whatever kind, a method which
bases action on facts.
Industry finds that not all engineer-
ing students have found in engineering
halls this key that unlocks all doors.
For those who have not, there are
the many strictly engineering positions
ranging from that of routine technician
to professional consultant.
Industry and society, in their biggest
problems, need more of the engineering
method, more straight thinking. C. F.
Hirshfeld, Chief of our Research De-
partment, believes that we humans are
rising from stage to stage and "we shall
so rise to the extent that we extend the
research method from its cradle in the
scientific laboratory through its later field
of growth in industry to the much larger
and more worth-while field of human
relations, or, let us say, the social struc-
ture." R. E. Flanders, President, A.S.
M.E., has recently said that we are
"new pioneers on a new frontier," that
new frontier being a social one: "a
greatly raised standard of living for the
mass of our fellow citizens." And Al-
fred P. Sloan, Jr., in a recent address,
"Industry's Responsibilities Broaden,"
labels as the most fundamental of all
fundamentals, "the causes of human
happiness and security."
You can share in the solution of these
important, fascinating, satisfying prob-
lems if you learn the scientific method
as a method. But here, as in getting
along with people, you must not assume
that because you are surrounded with
it, it is becoming part of your make-up.
Are you certain you know what it is?
Are you interested in finding out? If
you are I need not tell you where to go.
You are the kind who will find your
own answers.
Technical Proficiency Assumed
Before reviewing some other things
which Industry often criticizes in the
engineering graduate, appreciate that all
of the traits or abilities discussed in this
article are usually wanted in addition
to, not as a substitute for, technical en-
gineering knowledge. Industry must
have and is quite satisfied with your
technical proficiency. But some in
industry would willingly exchange a
share of that proficiency for your great-
er command of these other abilities.
Recognize that no additional courses
are here being suggested. You are urged
merely to bring into your attention and
consciousness things which have always
been in your environment but of which
you are unaware. It is similar to the
sensation in your left heel. If your at-
tention is called to it, there it is. Oth-
erwise you never think of it.
Other Opportunities
There are several other complaints
which seem to be rather frequently reg-
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


A very common one is your lack of
skill in communication, spoken and
written. Facility in expressing your
thoughts with tongue and pen, you will
find, is a great asset. There is, of course,
a close relation between clear, logical,
appropriate expression and the quality
which we called straight thinking. Skill
in expression comes from something
much more fundamental than rules of
grammar, phraseology, and style, al-
though those things are important. It
is really an aspect of the scientific habit
of thought. So, you see, a desire to
improve this ability might lead you into
deeper probings than you would at first
suppose necessary. You will gain, how-
ever, by adopting a more critical atti-
tude toward your speaking, writing, and
especially toward your reading. For ex-
ample, when you read a technical article
in a magazine, reflect on it and decide
exactly why it was easy or difficult to
read. When you hear a lecture or pre-
sentation try to determine why you were
affected the way you were.
"They should learn to be good sports,"
is the way one department head ex-
pressed one of his thoughts about you.
By that he did not mean that you
should become experts at betting on
football games or race horses. His com-
ment can be grouped with another one,
"They should be more adaptable, more
philosophical, when minor and major
disasters occur." He referred to a group
of men who, during the depression, were
transferred to his department and placed
at quite different and less skilled work
than in their former department. It
was a matter of this work or no work.
The difference in attitudes in men at
such a time is very striking. The causes
of such differences are deeply rooted,
and to change them is difficult. You
learn to adapt by adapting. You will
be helped by seeking and willingly as-
suming responsibility; and also by ex-
panding the sphere of your contacts
with people and other fields of knowl-
edge.
Several other criticisms will be men-
tioned but left for you to define, and
design remedies. One supervisor says,
"It should be made more clear to the
boys that this idea of starting at the
bottom is a fact, not a story. Too many
still expect that by the end of the first
year they will be supervising men and
drawing a big salary." Another remarks
that you should have a better cultural
balance: economics, history, literature,
music. And another: "... should have
a much better knowledge of current
events."
Note the heading of this section,
"Other Opportunities." That is a much
better label for all of these qualities
which, in the introduction, we referred to
as "lacks and deficiencies." For if you
are a true scientist you will look upon
mistakes, criticism, and variations from
expected results as opportunities. Many
notable advances have come from ex-
periments in which the scientist fol-
lowed, not his original plan or sequence,
but an adjusted new one indicated by
the entry of some totally new and un-
expected factor. Can you view your
engineering career scientifically? When
an alumnus in industry says, "But these
things may be engineering," will you
give such an unexpected factor proper
consideration?

"A delicate spongy dish, filled with
air by beating, mixed with various in-
gredients, and served hot from the
oven."1 This dictionary definition of
souffle, as a recent authority stated, is
an "inspired description" of the T.V.A.
experiment. T.V.A. and other public
ownership ventures have been in the
spotlight of newspaper publicity for
several months. The issue has been
foremost in public life for a quarter of
a century. However, "public ownership
in the United States is the exception;
private enterprise the rule. Moreover,
public utility services being in the main,
local in nature, public ownership of the
utilities is primarily a question of mu-
nicipal ownership."- Before discussing
the pros and cons of the municipal pow-
er issue, a brief and consequently frank

survey of Federal power projects may
raise some interesting and perhaps em-
barrassing questions on the subject. In-
asmuch as the Tennessee Valley Au-
thority project is the only one of the
seven — Boulder Dam (Colorado), Cas-
par- Alcova Project, Seminoe (Wyom-
ing), Grand Coulee (Washington),
Bonneville Dam (Oregon), Fort Peck
Project (Montana), Passamaquoddy
Tidal Project (Maine) — that has begun
commercial operation as yet our en-
quiry will center about it.
Politicians place undue emphasis on
the use of water power for generation
of electricity. It constitutes only 21%
of the total installed capacity of the in-
dustry. Naturally the value of water
power depends largely on its availabil-
ity for the consumers that will use it.
Note that 72r/f of the nation's available
water power is west of the Mississippi,
while &amp;0c/r of the country's industries
using electric power are east of the
Mississippi. Moreover, it is improbable
that there will be much of an increase
in the development of hydroelectric
power inasmuch as "the underlying
trend is toward the even greater use of
steam power—recent improvements in
the efficiency of steam plants have low-
ered costs; the risk attached to hydro
plants because of drought; the wide
extension of natural gas sewerage for
use in fuel plants; the more thorough
combustion of coal; conservation of heat
by improved furnaces, larger units and
increased steam pressure have all con-
tributed to the increased use of steam
stations. With all this it is not likely

mountain states can be economically de-
veloped to supply the requirements of
industry that is from eight to fifteen
hundred or more miles distant."3 Know-
ing this, one can't help but raise a quiz-
zical eyebrow at the "daring leadership"
of the national administration in its
power policy.
Often we hear the term "yardstick"
used in connection with T.V.A. Claim
has been made that it will form a basis
for measuring electric rates. The value
of any "yardstick" is extremely ques-
tionable. As was pointed out in last
month's article, comparisons of rates
prove nothing—each rate is distinctly
a local problem to be decided upon by
the local commission. Moreover, used
as a yardstick the honesty and fairness
of T.V.A. is also highly debatable. Ac-
counting manipulations by the govern-
ment in this project are far more start-
ling than any questionable accounting
methods of private companies. Comp-
troller General McCarl pointed out in
a report last June4 that T.V.A. expenses
in 1934 were $12,938,000 and receipts
were $826,180 (and there is little like-
lihood that the business of T.V.A. will
increase 10007C in the next few years
so that its budget might be balanced).
The government turned over to T.V.A.
dams, electric and nitrate plant and
other property valued at $133,000,000,
which reappeared on the books of
T.V.A. valued at only $51,000,000 with
no reason given (the importance of this
item comes from the facts that the fixed
charges of depreciation are based on
the original value of the property—if,
by a unique auditing system, T.V.A.
can cut this value in half, one of its
important fixed charges will be halved).
T.V.A. wrote off as depreciation 10%
oj gross sales, or a total of $82,618,
whereas Comptroller McCarl figured
that even if T.V.A.'s absurdly low val-
uation on plant and equipment were
accepted, at least $1,000,000 a year
ought to be charged off for depreciation.
T.V.A.'s freight is handled by rail-
roads at rates not to exceed 662/$% of
freight rates paid by private companies/'
All correspondence, advertising and cir-
culars go through the mails free of
charge. Private utilities have announced
that if the government gave to them
25% of the cost of the utility as it does
to municipalities, if it also paid one-
fifth of the cost of hydroelectric dams
as it does for T.V.A., and if they will be
relieved of taxes to the same extent as
competing government plants, they
could and would reduce their rates be-
low anything in the valley cither exist-
ing or proposed for government plantsf'
The municipal ownership movement
has been a political issue since the close
of the 19th century. In recent years
the tendency has been toward a relative
decline in the number and output of
municipalities because many municipal
companies found that they could pur-
chase their energy from private plants
much more cheaply than they could
produce it themselves. At the present
time, 52% of the total central electric
companies are municipal establishments.
This figure greatly exaggerates the im-
portance of public ownership because
this 52% has only 5% of the total gen-
erator capacity of the industry and
generates only a little more than 4%
of the total power. "Between the years
1929 and 1927 there were 834 estab-
lishments that changed from municipal
ownership to private ownership as com-
pared with only 35 that changed from
private ownership to municipal."T Of
the 437 municipal generating plants es-
tablished between 1920 and 1930, 323
or 74^v had been sold or abandoned by
1932. Yet, in all, municipal ownership
remains the most effective threat against
exploitation by private industry, and
the trend clearly shows that exploita-
tion nowadays is only a mere "shadow
of its former self" a bugaboo of only
the demagogues, and private utilities
are the more "public spirited" utilities.
In a brief survey such as this, space
does not permit a more scholarly and
detailed discussion of the municipal
utility controversy, and it will only be
attempted to outline some of the more
significant factors under (1) economic
consideration, (2) administrative prob-
lems, (3) conclusions.
Economic consideration: (1) Capital.
One of the benefits claimed for public
ownership is the saving in the cost of
capital due to lower interest rates paid
by municipalities. However, cities are
notoriously poor negotiators and the
additional risk of municipal ownership
often raises the interest rates on city
bonds. Moreover, large utility corpor-
ations can borrow almost as cheaply as
most cities, if not more cheaply. (2)
Unification. Municipal utilities are
claimed to effect savings by unification
and coordination of water, gas and elec-
tric services. The danger here is jumb-
ling of accounts and too greatly increas-
ing the burdens of city officials. "The
United States Census Bureau has re-
peatedly pointed out the objection to
the jumbling together of departmental
accounts and the consequent failure to
credit each service with the revenue
that it really earned and to debit it with
the expenses for which it was really re-
sponsible."" The dangers of deficit fi-
nanceering in this way are self evident.
(3) Regulation. It has been asserted
that substantial savings may be realized
by the discontinuance of the program of
regulation under public operation. How-
ever, the savings would be relatively
insignificant—Vis of 1 % of the gross re-
ceipts of all utilities regulated.9 More-
over, it would be unwise to completely
do away with regulation because pub-
licly owned utilities are often more in
need of stringent regulation than are
private utilities.
Administrative Problems: "Economy
of management constitutes the focal
point of the controversy over public
ownership."1" "The most telling argu-
ments against public ownership and
operation come from those who claim
that it means management by politi-
cians instead of business men."11 Waste-
ful, slothful and inefficient administra-
tion more than offsets possible savings
in public ownership.
(1) Business. From a business stand-
point, private corporations are decidedly
superior to municipal governments. In
the former, there is a heavy financial
stake. Responsible and flexible organ-
izations direct the policies, and the pen-
alty for inefficiency and failure to pro-
duce results is drastic but none the less
effective.
(2) Politics. In public management
political influences, security of position,
cumbersome organizations, all lead to
deficit financing and consequently the
burdens of cost are greatly shifted to
the tax-payer in order that the munic-
ipality can show rates lower than those
of nearby private plants.
(3) Incentives. Private companies
can select executive officers on the basis
of "demonstrated capacity"—in public
corporations political favor is more than
likely to be the deciding factor. More-
over, the incentive to efficiency is far
more potent in private operation. "Even
should the managers of publicly owned
utilities be free from arbitrary re-
straints and political influences in rais-
ing capital, awarding contracts, making

the personnel, adopting improved and
modern devices and extending the area
of operation. Public management is in-
ferior because there is not the incentive
that characterizes private manage-
ment."'- High minded and noble as it
is, the "service motive" as yet has failed
to produce the same efficient results as
does the "profit motive."
(4) Immaturity. The electric light
and power industry, powerful as it is,
has not yet reached that stage of ma-
turity which will keep it and the public
from heavily suffering from the inertia
of public operation. It is an enterprise
that requires a high degree of ability,
ingenuity and progressiveness. Munic-
ipal ownership does not offer these req-
uisites. "For some time to come there
will be . . . far reaching changes and
technical achievements of a high order;
and in our judgment private enterprise
is better able to cope with the changes
and to realize the achievements than is
public enterprise."13
Conclusions. As has been pointed
out, government ownership has its short-
comings. However, in municipal ven-
tures the risk is less, the enterprise more
easily supervised, fewer politicians in-
volved, and success and fairness is more
likely than in the grandiose splurge of
the Federal government. Every city
should have the right to municipalize
its utilities. Every city should prepare
themselves for public ownership. These
two factors alone are usually more than
sufficient to bring recalcitrant private
utilities into line. Private operation is
superior, both in service rendered and
rates charged, so, when possible, the
private enterprise should be preserved
and protected from political encroach-
ment.
When private enterprise oversteps the
line of good public policy, restrictions
should be brought into the picture, and
it is these controlling and limiting fac-
tors that will form the basis for our
next and final discussion in the April
Technic on "Regulation of Private
Utilities."

The 20th century addition to the old
definition of Engineering, which states
that, "Engineering is the science of con-
trolling the forces and utilizing the ma-
terials of nature for the benefit of man,"
is, "and the art of organizing and direct-
ing human activities in connection there-
with." This latter addition was due to
a general recognition that the Engineer,
in his various activities, was actually
concerned with functions and problems
outside the scope of the older definition.
Toward the end of the 19th century
business, especially manufacturing, was
profoundly affected by the development
and the application of scientific dis-
coveries to the production of goods and
services. New industries and the revising
of old ones, mass marketing and conse-
quent increase in the scale of operation
by
CHARLES B. GORDY
Professor of Mechanical Engineering
resulted in the creation of an industrial
machine vast in extent and complicated
in its many fold connections with the
economic system. The decade following
the World War was especially character-
ized by the speed, and range of spread
of these changes. New industries market-
ing, on a mass basis, products unknown
or little used in the early years of the
present century were firmly established
during the 1920's; among these indus-
tries may be mentioned automobiles,
rayon, radios, electrical devices of all
sorts, excavating and conveying ma-
chinery, oil burners, tractors and many
others.
The revolutionary changes effected by
the application of science to the material
and technical side of industry could not
but affect its managerial aspects. The
growth in the size and complication of
the industrial machine so increased the
scope and range of information required
to manage successfully that functional
specialists of many kinds had to be
added to care for the increase in admini-
strative load. Not the mere growth in
size was the basis for this increase how-
ever; but the scientific approach to the
mechanical problems of industry had its
counterpart in an increased appreciation
of the fact that the scientific method, at
least, was applicable to problems with
which management was concerned in
coordinating its expanded functions. We
have, as a consequence, the inauguration
of standards of all sorts, based on more
or less accurate methods of measure-
ment; standards, for example, of worker
performance, of material and its usage.

the construction of budgets.
It is to be expected that the rapid
technical advance in the last few decades
and the emergence of management as
one of the major factors in production
would exercise a marked influence on
training for the practice of engineering.
Engineering graduates in increasing
number are, and have been for the past
several years going into the operating
and management side of industry rather
than in Engineering pursuits in a narrow
sense. Engineering schools are no longer
places where narrow technicians are
trained, but they do prepare men and
women for industrial usefulness in a
rather broad way.
While objection to the admission of
management subjects in Engineering
curricula was encountered twenty years
ago, and the manner in which they
should be integrated in these curricula
is still a matter of debate, a certain
basic agreement or similarity in treat-
ment has been attained.
It is generally agreed that more eco-
nomic and business subjects should be a
part of all Engineering curricula. To
meet the needs of those students who
definitely plan on operating manage-
ment careers in industry, industrial man-
agement options have been added, and
in a great many institutions Depart-
ments of Industrial Engineering have
been established, using the name which
has gradually crystallized as a satis-

factory descriptive term for a type of
training differing in objective from es-
tablished programs.
Our own program in Industrial Engi-
neering covers a period of five years,
awarding the Degree of Master of Sci-
ence in Industrial Engineering. At the
end of the fourth year the student re-
ceives the degree of Bachelor of Science
in Engineering with the descriptive term
Mechanical, Electrical, or Chemical, de-
pending upon which of these three fields
was followed in the undergraduate years.
The Mechanical program, for example,
includes 14 hours of Factory Manage-
ment, or Industrial Engineering, 9 hours
of Economics, 14 hours of Business Ad-
ministration and 12 hours of electives,
which may be applied in any of these
broad groups. It has been our thinking
that the Industrial Engineer should be
a Mechanical, Chemical or Electrical
Engineer first, competent to compete on
an even basis with four-year graduates
in these fields. While his interests will
be in the executive or operating side,
the Industrial Engineer will ordinarily
find a definite line of approach to in-
dustry through much the same channels
as the Mechanical Engineer. Moreover,
establishment of professional status, im-
portant in consulting, but not as yet
formulated by state examination for In-
dustrial Engineering, is rendered possible
by the Engineering basic training.
The roots of so many problems with
which management is concerned in
operating modern industries are best
understood and evaluated by graduates
of such programs. The statement of
costs in manufacturing a particular
article, for instance, is an accounting or
business matter; the consideration of,
or the attempt to reduce these costs to a
proper level may and, with increasing
frequency do, involve engineering mat-
ters, such as questions of redesign of the
article, or designing more efficient tools
and equipment to be used in its produc-
tion, the redrawing of specifications, the
improvement in the method of conveying
the material, improvement in methods
used by the workmen or by management
in aiding the workman or any or all of
these matters in order that the company
in question may continue in business
and make a profit. Proper training in
preparation for usefulness in industry,
for meeting this dual nature of industrial
problems is hardly to be secured in an
elimination of a substantial part of the
four-year program in engineering, but in

accepting that as a basis and making ad-
ditions to it as is done in the program
of Industrial Engineering.
Industrial Engineering has been called
the formulated science of management.
However, since much of management is
still very much of an art, it is more in
order to consider it as the application of
the scientific method to the problems of
management. The general field may be
divided broadly into two divisions, an-
alysis of present conditions and the
creative synthetic phase, which aims by
new methods, new processes and im-
provement in the relations of manage-
ment, worker and consumer, to produce
more economically and with greater
service to the community.
The range in occupations of graduates
of this program may best be illustrated
by the activities of two recent graduates,
one of the class of 1928 and the other,
of 1933. The first is in the employ of a
firm of consulting engineers at present
engaged in the installation of wage in-
centive plans in Canadian factories, the
second, entering the training program of
a large automotive parts manufacturer
in company with graduates of four-year
courses, now has the title of Motion
Study Engineer. As such, his duties are
concerned with improving operating
methods throughout all departments of
the plant as well as conducting classes
for supervisors, tool designers, and

The young engineer who aspires to a
broader professional life will discover
some valuable bits oj wisdom in this
friendly chat with Mr. Swain, the orig-
inal of which took place before a group
oj engineering college editors at Phila-
delphia last fall.-EDiTOV.iAL NOTE.
Tonight I feel the urge to be person-
al, to be truthful, to ramble, and to
reminisce.
Although the majority of you may
never seek a connection with the tech-
nical press, you probably wonder, as
many others do, how editors get that
way.
Men enter editorial work by devious
paths—hardly two alike. Let me sketch
my own. Starting as a boy interested
in mechanics and scientific abstractions,
and little concerned with social contacts,
I dreamed my way through an A.B.
course, concentrating at the end on
physics and math., with the idea that I
would become a research physicist. But
this thought was not fully satisfying,
because several summers of machine-
shop experience, and my natural inter-
est in mechanical things, made me feel
that I would be still happier as an en-
gineer. So I went to Yale for four years
of study in mechanical engineering, and
two more degrees.
I credit Yale with pulling me out of
my shell a little, with convincing me
that men are as important and inter-
esting as machines, and that the engi-
neer must gain equal facility with both.
Still no thoughts of being an editor.
After getting my M.E., I accepted an
offer to teach mechanical engineering at
Yale. Practical engineering was still in
my mind as an ultimate goal, but here
by

was a job in hand in an environment I
had learned to love.
In 1916—I never quite figured why—
I had trained for a month at Platts-
burgh and acquired some highly inter-
esting military experience, learned that
even endless hoofing has its thrill, if
somebody else does the thinking for
you. My leanings were mildly pacifistic,
but the New England conscience was
on the job. That is probably why I re-
enlisted for three months in Plattsburgh
the day after President Wilson declared
war in the Spring of 1917. This was
followed by a shavetail commission,
then by a 1st Lieutenancy at Camp De-
vons, Mass. There followed drilling of
recruits and work as an artillery orien-
tation officer with ten months in France.
War was a sad experience for many
soldiers, but I was lucky—mixed with
a lot of fine men, saw England and a
quiet front in France, came home with
a rich experience and not a scratch.
(But please don't take this front-parlor
report as a good word for war, which,
on the whole, is a thoroughly rotten and
inhuman performance).
By now I was gaining a zest for con-
stantly new experiences. Each seemed
to give me something I had lacked be-
fore. Teaching might be all right again
scmq day, I thought, but I had to see
more of the world of affairs first. So I
plunged into a job of engineering sales-
manship. I was fairly successful in sell-
ing, which is rather surprising in view
of my early aversion to social contacts.
As a result of this and other experiences,
I am now convinced that salesmanship,
like a lot of other things, can be learned
if you set your mind to it. And you'd
better plan to draw a little blood in the
rough and tumble of selling if you want
to make the maximum progress in any
line of work.
Nothing will give you greater self-
confidence—and you've got to have it
if you expect to get anywhere. The
elimination of needless fear is probably
the single most important job any young
man can do for himself. He should
make it a point to list those things that
frighten him needlessly, and then go do
them all. If he is afraid to address a
gathering, he should seek an opportun-
ity to do so, and then go through with
it even if his knees knock. If he is
afraid to meet big men he should seek
them out in their lairs and stick his chin
out for them to swing at (they gener-
ally won't). If he is afraid to take de-
cisive action even though it be in line
with sound reasoning, he should force
himself to do so in several cases of not
too much moment, just to see what hap-
pens. The laboratory method!
If you' will do those things you will
discover that nine-tenths of the buga-
boos of life are nothing but thin air.
You will learn to stand up to them
without a whimper. And you will learn
how to avoid that one out of ten which
is real, and no kidding.
Study the men who get ahead and
see what a large percentage of them
have "nerve," plus salesmanship. Some
have nothing else. Don't envy the man
who gets along on "front" alone. Add a
little front to your own presumably su-
perior intellect and ability and show
him your dust.
Lack of front is the peculiar vice of
engineers. After years of observing
them, I am convinced that engineers as
a class are altogether too modest. The

er people begin to think you are some-
body. Then it pays, because people
often like to think their heroes are un-
assuming men. Before that it may be
an expensive luxury.
In looking for a job—whether it be
engineering, editorial or otherwise -
don't emulate some of the young grad-
uates of today. Don't tell your pros-
pective boss you are not sure you will
be of much use to him, but would like
a job. He isn't running an orphan's
home. It's wise, of course, to admit
that you don't know the details of his
business—that you've got to learn. But
make it clear that you learn fast, have
a habit of making good at everything
you tackle, and have, in general, a lot
on the ball. And, in particular, try to
think of some definite way in which
you can save him time and trouble and
help him make more money. Do not
misunderstand me. I'm not suggesting
that you play the smart Aleck, but
merely that you display a manly self-
confidence.
Every job application is a piece of
salesmanship and should have prepara-
tion in proportion to the importance of
the contact. If you get an appointment
with a key man on a job you would
really like, train for it as you would
train for a championship boxing bout.
Study his outfit—his product, catalogs,
or maybe magazines—figure out some
definite way you could fit into the pic-
ture. Then build up your own morale
with a good long sleep, a haircut, a
shine, a new tie (quiet, but somewhat
more costly than you would ordinarily
buy). Keep treating yourself in this
kingly fashion until you are convinced
that you are the sort of person that goes
places. Then make your call with a
veneer of deference, but not so thick
that the prospect can't see your own
belief in yourself shining through it. I
speak with some confidence in this mat-
ter because I have tried it in getting
jobs, and it works.
Without being more specific, I will
say that the company I was with as an
engineering salesman folded up back in
1921, and I went to New York in the
minor depression of that year, perfectly
confident that I could land a satisfac-
tory job in the big and strange city.
At the end of a single week I held op-
tions on three satisfactory jobs, using
the technique I have outlined. The
chance to go on Power as Assistant Ed-
itor seemed the most promising of the
three, so I took it and have never re-
gretted the step.
Since then I have not wandered far-
ther, because editorial work proved
uniquely interesting—a job of infinite
variety, utilizing everything I had
learned in my life, from the elements
of thermodynamics to selling heat insu-
lation to an oil refinery, from the Greek
alphabet to running an engine lathe. In
fact, it took a whole lot of things that
I had never learned, so that I have

Bob Fox
MODERN MARINER
Marine engineer,
soldier, sailing en-
thusiast — that's
Bob Fox, promi-
nent senior from
Sandusky, Ohio,
whose genial smile
and affable man-
ner have made him
many friends here.
Bob entered the
University in the
ill of 1932 as an all-A student from
igh school. He found little trouble
ith his studies, and he did so well that
t the end of his first semester on the
impus he was elected to Phi Eta Sig-
la. In the Spring term of his fresh-
lan year Bob served as freshman
•presentative on the Military Ball
jmmittee. The following fall he re-
irned to school to be elected President
f his sophomore class and in this ca-
acity represented his class on the En-
ineering Council. The success of the
934 Engineering Smoker was largely
ue to Bob's administrative abilities,
&gt;r he was its manager. At the end of
is sophomore year he stood at the top
f the list of men eligible for the ad-
anced course in the R.O.T.C.
In the R.O.T.C. Bob has won the
ild medal for the highest semester av-
-age in his unit no less than three
mes. He is now a member of Scab-
ard and Blade. As a marine engineer
e is an active member of Quarterdeck,
or his activities, Bob was elected to
'riangles. At present Fox is working
n the Slide Rule Dance committee.
All these activities and his consistent-
r high scholarship have been accom-
lished in spite of the fact that Bob
is found it necessary to earn his way
trough school. Bob now spends his
'enings in the basement of the Nat-
al Science Building, where he keeps
ack of the books in the forestry
&gt;rary.
In June, Bob will graduate. But, be-
re he settles down to the serious bus-
ess of making a living, he wants to
ke his last summer vacation. In fact,
)b has already planned his vacation
r the coming summer. In his own
•rds, he is "going to bum his way to
irope."
SECRETARY
It has been aptly said that "an or-
ganization is as good as its secretary."
If this be true a large part of the re-
sponsibility for the success of the class
of '36 rests on the shoulders of its sec-
retary, Sheldon Urennan. Thus far he
has not been found wanting and has
proved himself fully capable of hand-
ling the responsibility entrusted to him.
At the early age of ten Sheldon took
a trip to South America. It was on this
trip that he first became interested in
the mysteries of electricity. During the
voyage, the ship's radio caught his fan-
cy and soon absorbed his interest. So
persistent has Drennan's interest been
that he is now a senior electrical en-
gineer and an amateur radio operator
of no mean ability. Should you at any
time call \VADJQ or W4GG, don't be
surprised if you
hear the cheery
voice of Sheldon
Drennan, for these
are his call letters.
Drennan enrolled
in the College of
Engineering with
a purpose in mind
—that of learning
the electrical
Sheldon Drennan branch of the en-
gineering profession — and he has let
nothing come before that purpose. While
he considers extra-curricular activities
good experience and a lot of fun, stud-
ies, the basis of a sound professional
training, come first with Sheldon.
However, he has found time to win
his numerals as a speedy sprinter on
the track squad and during the last two
years he has served on the Honor Coun-
cil, has regularly attended the meetings
of the local student branch of A.I.E.E.
and has been an active member of the
Alpha Delta Phi fraternity.
Drennan plans to use his technical
training as a foundation for a career in
engineering sales. Combining an excel-
lent technical training with his enthu-
siastic optimism, fine personality, and
the persistency and constancy of pur-
pose he has shown throughout his col-
lege career, he should certainly be able
to "fill the bill" in any engineering sales
position.
TREASURER
Last fall, when the senior class was
looking for a competent man to assume
the responsibility of adding several hun-
dred dollars to its bank account by
June, Howard Jackson was nominated
and elected to the position of class
treasurer. That the confidence of the
members of the senior class was not
misplaced is evidenced in the way Jack-
son is handling this difficult and not too
pleasant job. You've heard of the "en-
gineering method." It is suggested that
underclass treasurers get in touch with
Jackson and find out how it is applied
to that "brain-busting" problem of dues
collecting.
Howard Jackson might be referred to
as an engineer who has come about as
close as is possible to the perfect bal-
ance of school work and extra-curricu-
lar activities. Perhaps his efficient time
budgeting system has something to do
with it. Scholastically, Howard ranks
in the upper eighth of this year's group
of graduating chemical engineers. In
addition to his senior class office, he is
A.I.Ch.E. representative on the Engi-
neering Council and was a member of
the central committee of the Engineer-
ing Ball, which established itself as a
new Engineering College tradition last
fall. Also, he is earning the major por-
tion of his expenses while at college.
But even with this full schedule, he us-
ually manages to forget class dues and
Jeremaissen crystallizers long enough
each week-end to spend a few hours at
Martha Cook Dormitory.
As a first lieutenant in the Ordnance
branch of the R.O.T.C., Howard at-
tended camp last summer at Aberdeen
Proving Ground, Maryland. After the
regular camp period he toured the East
and South, the trip giving him an op-
portunity to prac-
. tise one of his
favorite hobbies,
camping in the
^ open.
Next year, How-
ard intends to re-
turn to Michigan
to do graduate
work in chemical
engineering, spec-
ializing in organic
Howard Jackson technology.

* i ENGINEERING SMOKER
'2!
£ The Annual All-Engineering Student
rJ and Faculty Smoker is scheduled for
us Tuesday, March 24. Mr. William S.
Knudsen, executive vice-president of
the General Motors Corporation, has
e been secured by the Engineering Coun-
cil to deliver the address of the evening.
Mr. Knudsen has consented to give
the same talk as that which he pre-
i sented before the Detroit Engineering
Society in December. In The Detroit
Sews appeared the following comment
on this talk: "In a humorous and rem-
iniscent mood, he chatted and laughed
with his delighted audience for an hour
• about the fantastic development of the
automobile industry.
"While not intended as such, his
speech really was the saga of a Danish
lad who came to America, started out
as a railroad man, got a job in a Buf-
falo bicycle factory at $ 10.50 a week
and came to be the manufacturing head
of the General Motors Corporation."
No engineering student should miss
this opportunity to listen to one of the
biggest men and most colorful personal-
ities in the whole automobile industry.
It is the aim of the Engineering Coun-
cil in sponsoring these annual affairs to
acquaint student engineers with some
of the outstanding men in the profes-
sion and also to afford an opportunity
for students from all engineering de-
partments to enjoy an informal get-to-
gether meeting at least once a year.
We'll see you there.
TIME—TO SPEND OR INVEST
Please substitute "engineer" for "life
insurance man" in the following quota-
tion. "The greatest weakness of the life
insurance man today is not in his
knowledge of the business—not in his
unfamiliarity with successful selling
ideas and methods—not in his limita-
tions and personal ability—it is in the
fact that he is, and continues to be, un-
systematic," says Mr. G. Franklin
Ream of the Mutual Benefit Company.
"Unsystematic"—what does it mean?
For reasons which shall become self-
evident, an analysis of that query might
be resolved into this simple question:
"Do you spend your time, or do you
invest it?" Too often the answer is:
"You spend it." But what is the differ-
ence between spending and investing?
Simply this: when you spend money
(or time) you dissipate it without re-
gard for any future return, considering
only the pleasure of the moment; when
you invest money (or time) you lay it
out methodically and productively with
the idea of obtaining a continuous fu-
ture return. If, then, you spend your
time, you are being unsystematic. You
are unsystematic when you will not in-
vest your time in the profitable fields of
culture, experience and education; when
you consider too laborious the task of
regular daily study; when you refuse to
organize your life along the lines that
are known to have brought success to
other men; and instead rely entirely on
your luck, good hunches and personal-
ity to carry you to the top.
Whether you are to remain unsys-
tematic—to continue to spend your time
instead of investing it—is your choice,
but "it is not a free choice." Before
you decide whether you will remain un-
systematic consider the costs of being
and remaining so. It is common knowl-
edge that those who win pay the price,
but it is seldom that you consider the
costs that you incur when you dodge
the price of success. By remaining un-
systematic you incur the enormous cost
of the work you do not "get around to
do." Then too, the quality of the work
ycu do manage to turn out will be low
because of your general slipshod tac-
tics. You will suffer the loss of the
reputation that you do not achieve. You
will pay the price of forfeited leadership
and salary.
Remember, then, that your greatest
weakness is that you spend your time
rather than invest it—that you are un-
systematic. Before you choose to re-
main unsystematic consider the costs
that you will incur.
"BY HIS KEYS YE SHALL KNOW
HIM"
The dazzling array of watch charms
displayed by the up-and-coming BMOC
usually fools three general classes of
humanity, namely, the unsuspecting
rushee, the unsuspecting coed and fin-
ally, the unsuspecting employment man-
ager. Some of these charms may have
been earned by a year's work on a
student publication or in a speech so-
ciety; they may represent an award to
a fraternity officer or an award for high
scholastic standing. The ones which
really question the reason for it all are
the emblems of the various campus hon-
orary societies.
In this select group of honorables are
the supposed leaders in the University,
who by active service have earned the
right to wear the emblem of the honor
society. But have they? Who knows
why they were elected? Some were
elected because they were fortunate in
having been well acquainted with sev-
eral of the old members, others had a
fraternity brother or two among the
active members, and still others earned
the right to membership. Of course it
is essential for all those fortunate jun-
iors and sophomores to have the neces-
sary twelve dollars or more required for
initiation fee.
In this fee requirement lies one of
the greatest weaknesses in the present
honor society system. We all know
that there are many deserving students
on the campus who must earn their way
through school and usually do not have
much extra cash. Some of these stu-
dents deserve recognition for their work
but are unable to pay for it. Others in
this group scrape the necessary cash to-
gether and invest it in the society from
which they have received a bid. Much
to their sorrow, they too often find
themselves asking the question, "What
for?" after it is too late.
May we see the day when the mem-
bers of these honorary societies will
elect to their society only those men de-
serving of the honor regardless of finan-
cial status or fraternity affiliation. We
feel that this is the least that could be
done in an effort to place the honor
societies before the student body as
legitimate organizations.

TRANSIT
SLANTS
THE ANSWER IS: NO!
The following is an actual reply received from a student
in answer to the fifth question of the Ch.E. 2 Final Ex-
amination, Feb. 4, 1935. The same student has since trans-
ferred to the other side of the campus.
Q. At present a boiler plant is burning coal in stoker
fired units. The coal costs $4.00 per ton, etc., etc. A sales-
man of powdered coal equipment guarantees complete com-
bustion of this coal with 25% excess air ... Would you
accept the salesman's proposition?
A. No, and that salesman would receive a pretty
speech! !—Behold the glory that was Greece. Demosthenes
and Euripides; Socrates and the hemlock. Alack! Gaze at
the splendor of the Parthenon, the temple of Athena. Did
they have powdered coal units? No! ! All Greece cried out
against powdered coal units. Look at them today—the
smartest people that ever ran a corner candy store. Now
look to Rome and the splendor of the Caesars. What splen-
dor, ah! what splendor—wine, women, song. But no pow-
dered coal units!! Look even to Nero, who fiddled while
Rome burned. Was Rome burning powdered coal? Hell,
no! If Rome had been burning powdered coal, can you
imagine at what rate it would have burned? Nero wouldn't
have had time to fiddle! He wouldn't have wanted to
fiddle! Indeed, a damning piece of evidence right there!
As Rome burns, so burns the nation. And so Rome passes
and we forget the Italians until Mussolini shows us that
a black shirt on the chest is worth two powdered coal units
in the bush.
And you still want to sell us powdered coal units? Young
man, we have figured and connived, calculated and in-
tegrated, we have been down to the very depths of hell
with your damned coal units. Do they burn powdered coal
down there? Do they? No!! You know it and I know it.
They haven't and they never will because the system they
use now is doing powerfully well, powerfully well my son.
Alack and alas—when they can still toast two for the price
of one, they have better efficiency than Joe's Snappy
Service.
And with these parting words, my son, pick up your
powdered coal unit and be off, and may God rest you merry
gentlemen.
A very strict lady was called out of bed one morning at
five a.m. The following dialog ensued:
Voice: "Hello."
Lady: "Hello!"
Voice: "How are you this morning?"
Lady: "All right."
Voice: "Then I guess I must have the wrong number."

Who is the man designs our cars with judgment, skill, and
care?
But leaves it to the service man to keep them in repair?
Who estimates their useful life at just about a year?
The bearing-wearing, gearing-tearing, auto engineer!
Who is it takes a transit out to find a sewer to tap?
Who then with care extreme locates the junction on the
map?
Who then proceeds to dig it up and finds it nowhere near?
The mud-bespattered, torn and tattered, civil engineer!
Who is the man will draw a plan for anything you desire,
From a transatlantic liner to a hairpin made of wire?
With "Ifs" and "ands," "howevers" and "buts," who makes
his meaning clear?
The work-disdaining, fee-retaining, consulting engineer!
Who builds a road in fifty years that disappears in two?
Then changes his identity so there's no one left to sue?
Who sprinkles all the travelled roads with filthy, oily smear?
The bump-providing, rough-on-riding, highway engineer!
Who thinks without his products we would all be in the
lurch?
Who has a heathen idol that he designates Research?
Who tints the creeks, perfumes the air, and makes the
landscape drear?
The stink-evolving, grass-dissolving, chemical engineer!
Who takes the pleasure out of life and makes existence hell?
Who'd fire a real good-looking one because she could not
spell?
WTho substitutes a dictaphone for a coral-tinted ear?

For over thirty years the Department
of Chemical Engineering has carried on
research in the various phases of pulp
and paper manufacture. During this
time certain special equipment was ac-
quired, but a fully equipped laboratory
was never realized. Now, however, all
the modern equipment necessary for
complete testing and thorough research
in pulp and paper manufacture has
been installed in rooms on the third
floor of the East Engineering Building.
The new research center was presented
last November to the University of
Michigan by the paper manufacturers
of Michigan and allied interests.
All the paper testing instruments are
located in an insulated room kept at a
constant temperature of 70 degrees and
humidity of 65 per cent by a special air
conditioning unit. The physical proper-
ties of paper are tested by the delicate
instruments housed in this room. Be-
cause of the marked effect of atmos-
pheric conditions on paper, all testing
must be done under these constant at-
mospheric conditions.
Boxes, books, newspapers, writing
and wrapping paper—for each of these
purposes paper must have specific prop-
erties. The United States paper money
must have great folding strength. This
is determined by counting the number
of times a single piece of paper will fold
BENNETT R. WHEELOCK. '37E
under tension. An intricate imported
machine does this in the new labora-
tory. The amount of sizing is deter-
mined by noting the curl of a unit piece
of paper when moistened on one side.
The printer is greatly interested in this
quality, for upon it depends the amount
of ink he must use. Also of importance
to paper users is the surface quality.
The roughness is determined by the
amount of air which will pass between
the paper and a smooth glass plate.
The variance in the gloss of paper is
easily noticeable; newspapers have prac-
tically none, while most magazines have
a great deal. This quality is measured by
paper's ability to reflect light. Makers
of wrapping paper and paper bags are
most interested in bursting strength.
The pressure necessary to burst a unit
area of paper is an indication of this
strength. Tearing force is also of inter-
est to these manufacturers, and this is
determined by noting the force neces-
sary to tear a piece of paper of unit
size.
Most publishers are interested in the
opacity of their paper, that is, the lack
of transparency. One of the most mod-
ern paper testing machines is the opa-
ciometer. This instrument measures the
light absorbed by a piece of paper.
Some papers are more porous than oth-
ers, and this is determined by noting
the time required for air under pressure
to pass through a unit area of paper.
The tensile strength of paper is as in-
teresting to the printer and publisher as
the tensile strength of steel is to the
builder. This is tested in a very deli-
cate machine quite similar to a steel
tensile testing apparatus, only much
smaller. The resistance paper gives to
bending, or its stiffness, is measured by
reading the amount of swing of a
weighted pendulum pressing against the
paper being tested. All these qualities
of paper, so essential to both the con-
sumer and manufacturer of paper prod-
ucts, can now be determined in the new
laboratories.
All paper has a grain in it, just like
wood. The physical properties differ
with respect to the grain. This, as well
as all other properties, depends upon
the size, kind, treatment and formation
of the fibers making up the paper. Fiber
structure is studied by slides prepared
by drying a few drops of the pulp on a
piece of glass. The slides are studied
under the microscope, or by projecting
them on the screen with a camera.
The remaining portion of the labora-
tory contains apparatus for the manu-
facture of experimental batches of pa-
per and equipment for the chemical an-
alysis of paper and pulp.
Paper testing instruments are housed in a controlled temperature
and humidity room.

SLIDE RULE
TRADITION
It all goes "Way back when," when
lawyers and engineers were taught in
the same class-rooms, and the lawyers
received their degrees without the pre-
law period in the literary college. It
seems that Michigan traditions all go
back to the "good old days," as our
more sentimental alumni often refer to
them. And this particular tradition has
every right to be venerated for its age;
it goes back to the time when several
beers along State Street held the place
of ten o'clock coffee at the Parrot. The
Slide-Rule Dance is the annual engi-
neering social occasion, and has grown
up with the other campus events,
among which is the lawyers' Crease
Dance.
With the annual engineering social
conniption coming in the near future,
thoughts of those hectic times are once
again brought to mind. You see, there
were three times during the year when
a feud would present itself in actual
physical outbreaks between the Engi-
neers and their University colleagues
on the other side of the campus; once
after the annual spring athletic con-
tests between the Engineers and the
Lawyers, with the arguing participants
and spectators concluding their quarrels
on the run up State Street and climax-
ing the matter on the campus proper;
again during the annual "swingout"
that was held just before graduation.
Pity the luckless Lawyer who had the
temerity to trespass beneath the Engi-
neer's Arch at this time. The Engineers
considered it their hallowed duty to
prevent any Lawyer from desecrating
the sanctity of the Arch with his pres-
ence—and Engineers are not prone to
verbal persuasion. The third conflict
was the night of the Slide-Rule Dance.
It seems that the Slide-Rule had an
uncanny faculty of occurring on the
same night as the Lawyers' annual
Crease Dance. Both Lawyers and En-
gineers greeted this night with warm
enthusiasm. Once a group of playful
engineers wandered over to their rivals'
dance, left a "stink bomb," and then
took their leave. The "Shysters" retal-
iated by thoroughly dousing the in-
trepid engineers with water which had
not had sufficient time to cool. Occa-
sionally such weapons as antiquated
eggs were used to carry on the rivalry
at a greater distance.
The Engineers were fighting for their
prestige, and the lawyers likewise. But
the time came when the Lawyers grew
old and feeble with bald heads and grey,
and were no longer able to take care of
themselves, so they moved into their
sanctum away from the rest of the
campus.
The feud is now a thing of the past—
only ths Slide-Rule Dance remains—
the rest is tradition.
EVAPORATOR
SPECIALIST
Twenty years spent in research and
development work in the field of heat
transfer and evaporation have qualified
Professor Walter L. Badger of the
Chemical Engineering Department for
a position of international authority on
those subjects. Professor Badger's early
work at Michigan was on gas and fuel
analysis, but later he was very active
in the development of courses in the
unit processes of chemical engineering.
Before joining the Michigan faculty
in 1912 as instructor in chemical engi-
neering, Professor Badger was an in-
structor in general chemistry at the
University of Minnesota. He had pre-
viously received an A.B., B.S., and M.S.
Professor W. L. Badger

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


sota, he spent a campaign with the
Great Western Sugar Co. as chemist in
their Colorado Plant, and from there
he accepted a two-year assistantship in
chemistry at the Bureau of Standards.
Teaching at Michigan has not entire-
ly restricted Professor Badger's activity
in the industrial field. In 1916 he be-
came associated with Swenson Evapo-
rator Co. as director of research and
consulting engineer. Under a special
cooperative agreement, the Swenson Co.
has installed evaporator research equip-
ment in the University of Michigan
chemical engineering laboratory, the
equipment being available for student
experimentation and research. Profes-
sor Badger has also served as consult-
ing engineer for a large number of well
known companies. He has been granted
patents on the evaporation of certain
substances and on improvements on the
Yaryan-type evaporator.
At the present time, he is presenting
a series of lectures before the employ-
ees of the Dow Chemical Co. He also
has begun research for the Corning
Glass Works on the problem of heat
transfer in chemical glassware equip-
ment.
MR. KRAUS RESIGNS
From the Metal Processing Depart-
ment comes word that Charles E. Kraus,
instructor in Machine Shop Practice,
has resigned his teaching position here
to take charge of the Research Depart-
ment of the Ingersoll Milling Machine
Company of Rockford, 111. Mr. Kraus,
who became a student assistant in 1929
and an instructor in 1932, received his
B.S.E.(M.E.) in the latter year and
earned his master's degree in June 1935.
We also learned that William A.
Spindier, assistant professor in the Met-
al Processing Department, was recently
married. He has been teaching M.P. 2
and 3 since he became an instructor
here in 1930. Michigan granted him
his master's degree in June 1933.
BENZOL-CELLULOSE PLASTIC
Investigators in plastics are working
on a new product made from benzol and
cellulose. This plastic is said to exhibit
physical properties which are very sim-
ilar to those of cellulose acetate. It is
expected, however, that this product
will be able to be produced much more
cheaply than the acetate.

man. His present position, that of a
member of the Board of Consulting
Engineers for the Metropolitan Water
District of Southern California, is only
one of the numerous "big jobs" in his
career. It is this organization that is
constructing the aqueduct which will
carry water to Southern California
from the Colorado River.
After leaving Michigan, he received
the degrees of Master of Civil Engi-
neering and Doctor of Philosophy from
Cornell University. He has held pro-
fessorships in both Brigham Young Uni-
versity and the University of Utah. He
is a member of Sigma XI and several
well known professional societies. His
father and grandfathers were pioneers
in Utah, and Mr. Lyman himself has
been a pioneer in engineering through-
out the Far West.
As president of his class, Mr. Lyman,
preferring to be known merely as
"Dick" Lyman, was largely responsible
for the success of its last reunion.

GUEST LECTURERS ANNOUNCED
Included in the Summer Session's list
of guest lecturers are two outstanding
men in the field of Applied Mechanics.
H. M. Westergaard, Professor of Theo-
retical Applied Mechanics at the Uni-
versity of Illinois and responsible for
the Conjugate Beam Theory, is to teach
Theory of Elasticity (E.M. 13a) and
Bending of Slabs (E.M. 28). A repre-
sentative of Harvard, J. P. Du Hartog,
Assistant Professor of Applied Mechan-
ics, will present a course in Fluid Me-
chanics (E.M. 27) and Stresses in
Machine Parts (E.M. 14).
(Continued from Page 9)
others in this important phase of the
plant's activities.
Professional practice in this field is
preceded by some years of experience
in individual plants; indeed the greatest
opportunities are to be found in such
connections since promotion from within
the organization has become the settled
policy of most manufacturing institu-
tions. The strong basis foundation train-
ing, coupled with work in Industrial
Management, Accounting, Finance, and
Economics, affords a wide range of op-
portunities to graduates of Industrial
Engineering programs, which are par-
ticularly significant in a rapidly chang-
ing industrial picture. Plant and depart-
mental rearrangements of equipment,
selection and installation of equipment
and labor saving devices, establishment
of wage incentive plans, safety engineer-
ing, elimination of fatiguing methods of
doing work, cost reduction studies, elim-
ination of wastes in materials, the devis-
ing of standards of expense embodied in
operating budgets and improving works
management relationships are typical
Industrial Engineering activities. While
these functions are indicative of func-
tional specialization, the training of the
Industrial Engineer is of such a charac-
ter as to prepare one for operating su-
pervisory activities, and indeed this is
one of the usual forms of employment
following a period of plant training after
graduation.

FLAKED COFFEE
The advent of flaked coffee was a result of careful and
thorough investigation by a research engineer whose object
was to discover whether coffee could be kept indefinitely in
air tight cans. He also wished to eliminate the bulging which
so often occurred in the ends of the cans. It was found that
this bulging was caused by carbon dioxide gas evolved by
the coffee.
In the new process, which is continuous, the whole coffee
beans are simply run between a set of smooth-surfaced rolls
which press the beans into very thin flakes. Packing in this
condition results in improved keeping qualities of the coffee,
increased extractability, and absence of bulging in the cans.
A huge new machine for polishing plate glass has just
been installed at the Ford Motor Company. The machine
will allow the large sheets of glass to go through the entire
polishing process without stopping.
OCCUPATIONAL DISEASE HAZARD
The engineer in any industrial plant is faced with the
problem of occupational disease. It is a serious challenge
to his ability to foresee and correct those processes or con-
ditions which will lead to disease. Very often it requires
the use of great engineering skill. Following are a few
simple steps an engineer can take to check and control
occupational disease:
1. Make a permanent list of materials used in, or given
off from, each process. Check this against "Occupa-
tion Hazards and Diagnostic Signs," bulletin from the
U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, to discover danger-
ous vapors and dust.
2. Information concerning the injurious properties of the
material as well as the concentrations above which
they are hazardous should be obtained.
3. Determine which of the potentially hazardous condi-
tions are causing injury and should be controlled.
4. Engineer the control measures checking the complete-
ness of control by determining the concentration of
injurious material in the air breathed by the workers.
5. Institute routine of maintenance and check-up deter-
minations.
STEEL CASTING MOLDS BONDED WITH CEMENT
Cement used in molds for steel casting has been tried by
different experimenters at various times, but with little suc-
cess. One inventor, realizing that the dissatisfaction with
present foundry sand mixtures centers in the fact that the
bonding ingredients give up steam or gas, or both, when the
molten metal is introduced, reasoned that the ideal material
should be inert. Silica sand and cement gave such a ma-
terial. This mixture has proven to be strong and hard, gives
off no steam or gas, and usually requires no re-enforce-
ments. The water is present in chemical combination. The
molding material is reclaimed by breaking it away from the
metal and pulverizing the mixture. Small additions of ce-
ment are made before the sand is again formed into molds.
This procedure is called the Randupson process and was
developed in France. At the present time it is being used
by only one foundry in this country.

Hoback Canyon East of Camp
The Department of Geodesy and Surveying offers summer courses in surveying at
Camp Davis, Wyoming, situated in Jackson's Hole on U. S. Highway 187, about 20
miles south of Jackson. A splendid climate with clear days and cool nights, a consider-
able area near the camp clear of trees and brush, together with a topography varying
from gentle slopes to rugged mountains makes this region an ideal one for the teaching
of surveying.
Students and faculty are housed comfortably in permanent buildings provided with
running water, electric lights and a modern sanitary system. The mess provides ex-
cellent meals.
The work is arranged to allow for a three-day trip to Yellowstone National Park,
as well as for week-end trips to nearer points of interest. The cost for the eight weeks
session varies between $125 and $150, depending somewhat on the mode of trans-
portation.

LET SCIENCE ARBITRATE
In heated arguments of this kind, the color analyzer
is the court of last resort. Recording photoelectric
spectrophotometer is the official name of this device,
which was recently exhibited at a scientific meeting
at St. Louis. It recognizes an infinite variety of hues
and shades; it distinguishes differences in color too
slight for human eyes to detect; it automatically
records the exact color prescription.
The spectrophotometer is proving especially useful
for standardizing the color specifications of inks,
dyes, paints, paper, and textiles. It makes obsolete
such vague descriptive names as blue-black, blue-
white, and yellow-green, and substitutes carefully
drawn graphs extending over the whole visible spec-
trum. The operation of the device, which is auto-
matic, depends upon an ingenious combination of
a phototube and thyratron tubes with a precise
optical system.
The previous method of making exact color measure-
ments required hundreds of tiresome readings and
consumed most of a day. The recording spectro-
photometer produces a curve of comparable accuracy
in three minutes.
DIG HERE
In the old days, a mysterious individual, called a
dowser, with a forked devining rod of witch hazel,
used to be called in to locate lost articles buried in
the earth. A new magnetic detector, recently de-
veloped in the General Engineering Laboratory of
the General Electric Company, is now substituting
science for magic and hocus-pocus. With uncanny
accuracy, it is tracking-down lost pipe lines.
Water and gas pipes are often lost because old
surveys are inaccurate or because records have been
destroyed. Digging up a whole street, in order to find
a missing pipe line, is expensive business. The new
detector has solved this problem by successfully
locating pipes laid 40 years ago—pipes buried
as much as seven feet below the surface. In one
case, pipes were found fully 100 feet from their
supposed location, and the detector spotted them
within one diameter of the pipe.
NEW LIGHT ON THE MIDDLE AGES
Medieval ecclesiastics would cry "Witchcraft!"
could they see the cathedral at Burgos, Spain,
tonight. Carefully wrought details of architecture
and ornamental carving, never before clearly seen
in all their seven hundred years, now stand forth in
bold relief. The thirteenth-century Gothic struc-
ture glows, for two hours each night, in the light of a
battery of modern General Electric floodlights.
Burgos was, for centuries, the capital of Old Castile,
the kingdom of that Queen Isabella who offered to
pawn her jewels to finance Columbus' momentous
voyage to America. Now, after 444 years, American
lighting equipment returns to add luster to what was
one of the most important of Isabella's posses-
sions.

ttiyj CONTRIBUTION
DUSTLESS, LOW-COST ROADS
STATISTICALLY, it may he interesting to record
that The Dow Chemical Company is one of the fore-
most producers of calcium chloride, which it markets
under the trade name, Dowflake.
But, far more gratifying to Dow than large tonnage is
the ever-growing acceptance of Dow methods and Dow-
flake in the building and maintenance of better roads.
Fifteen years ago Dow chemists saw in the basic water-
attracting and holding characteristics of calcium chloride
an answer to a pressing public problem—dusty roads.
Rapidly growing traffic—faster vehicles—both combined
to focus attention on road dust. For not only did dust
constitute an annoyance and hazard—it represented the
loss of actual mad surface—material that must be re-
placed. In short, it represented the taxpayers' money—
the cost of road crews, of equipment and materials.
Thus, Dow pioneered and advocated the application of
calcium chloride as a method of road dust control.
Spread upon the surface it gathers and retains sufficient
moisture to greatly retard the development of dust.
Following this primary use, further research and study
brought forth a totally new technique in road construc-
tion. Within a special laboratory, Dow built sample roads
to determine the best combination of dirt road materials.
Out of this effort Dow gave to road engineers a method
of stabilized road construction wherein low cost aggre-
gates, soil binders and Dowflake are scientifically com-
bined to give a surface of boulevard-like smoothness,
dust-free, with exceptional wearability.
In addition to its great service in road building and
maintenance, Dowflake (calcium chloride) does many
other things. Notably, it has speeded concrete construc-
tion (both road and structural) by accelerating the set.
It is used in fighting icy pavements. Combined with
sand or cinders, it prevents these abrasives from freez-
ing; keeps I hem ready for fast spreading and embeds
them into ice through its melting action.
Coal treatment is still another instance. Here, under
the Dow tradename of Kollrcat, calcium chloride pre-
vents dust which is obnoxious in the home and, developed
at the dealer's yards, represents a cash loss to him.
Obviously, the value of calcium chloride for dust control
on public roads is carried to private estates, to tennis
courts, playgrounds, race tracks, fairs and other places
where dust is objectionable.
Calcium chloride is only one of more than 250 chemical
products bearing the Dow name. Each in its field is
respected and each, like Dowflake, brings definite
benefits or advantages to millions of people.

S,
A more appropriate subject might be
•'Difficulties of Finding Summer Em-
ployment in Detroit." For, to tell the
truth, I have found after four years of
hunting for industrial jobs for co-
operative students that early summer
is the worst time to look. The best we
could generally do was to line up some
good jobs that would probably "break"
in the early fall. However, I do not
want to be too discouraging, so to
paraphrase a prominent Liberty Leag-
uer, "let's look at the record." Just
what have been industrial conditions in
Detroit in past summers, and what will
be the probable performance this year?
Industrial activity in Detroit follows
pretty closely the curve of production
in the automotive factories. Even though
the product may not on first sight ap-
pear to be related to the automobile
field, ten to one it has some connection
somewhere along the line. Pittsburgh
Plate Glass Co., for example, makes
house paints in Milwaukee, but its De-
troit subsidiary, Ditzler Color Co., is
devoted entirely to automotive lacquers.

FRANK J. OLIVER
Industrial Co ordinator
University of Detroit
Employment in the big factories begins
to taper off along about the first of
June, and last year the index number
struck bottom around Aug. 1. By Nov.
1, employment was about normal again
as the auto plants were pushing produc-
tion to meet sales made at the fall
showings. The same performance is ex-
pected this coming summer.
In line with good industrial relation
policies, most of the larger plants are
adhering rather closely to seniority rat-
ings in handling layoffs and rehiring
during slack periods of production. The
man with a long service record gets
more time in a year, particularly if he
is the all-around type that can fit into
a number of given situations. A man
with family obligations naturally gets
preference over a single man, unless the
latter is a world beater. In other words,
it would be a waste of time to hit the
employment offices of the big plants.
You will find an occasional plant, how-
ever, like the Ford Motor Company,
that will give summer employment to
college students, largely a matter of
public policy, that is, to further the
education of youth. Such concerns
handle their contacts through the regu-
lar college placement service.
Well, you may say, I am not look-
ing for a shop job. Maybe not, al-
though the experience will do you good.
Let's try an engineering department.
Automotive design is not particularly
active in mid-summer. The 1937 "jobs"
will be tied up in the bag months be-
fore June rolls around. The real prob-
lem is to engineer jobs for production—
to work out the "bugs." This is a
job for the experts, those mechanical
geniuses that can make the theoretically
possible, actually possible. No place for
the green student here. A college man
is unfortunately not a skilled mechanic.
However, there is excellent experience
to be found on machine repair jobs and
plant change o%'er work. Men working
in such trades are at it 16 hours a day,
seven days a week, while you go beg-
ging.
If you have read this far, you have
about decided to persuade Dad that
APRIL, 1936
3


spend the summer at the lake. But, all
is not lost. There are still ways and
means.
In the first place, if I were a stu-
dent, I would not overlook several bets.
First on the list is "drag." Maybe, my
dad or uncle knows a vice-president
who can be persuaded to take a kindly
interest in my welfare. It is surprising
what a top executive can do in getting
around some of the usual regulations
that lesser executives must follow.
In the second place, even if I didn't
know the vice-president, I'd ask to see
him anyway, rather than go around to
the back door and ask at the employ-
ment office. I'd frankly state that I was
out to get some practical experience in
addition to needed funds to continue in
school next fall. But I would not em-
phasize the need end too strongly. That
will only remind him of competition in
the form of men about to be laid off.
I would rather pick a firm that I would
like to hook up with as a graduate, and
put my appeal on the basis of starting
in training for that future job. I think
that if I were able to interest that ex-
ecutive in me as possible future material
for the company, he would hire me. If
I made a real hit, he might even create
some nitch in the organization for me,
just to let me demonstrate my "stuff."
Even now there is a real scarcity of
promising men in industry. It is easier
now to sell a man on the idea of put-
ting college students, particularly "co-
ops" or graduates, on a training pro-
gram than it has been in some years.
Things are on the upgrade, and as com-
panies expand their operations they
need more men capable of supervising
technical operations. They do not seek
men, who are merely looking for a
"job" or a chance to work. They want
young men who have definite aims and
ambitions, who want to do things in a
big way, and who want to prepare for
the job ahead. Young men who can
"take it," who can mingle with the
ordinary worker without reminding that
worker of the superior social and edu-
cational qualifications of the college
man, but who nevertheless will deliver
the plus value a college-trained man
should have.
Assuming I were that kind of a young
man, I would go after a summer job in
the same fashion that I would seek a
position as a graduate. In the first
place, I would carefully analyze my
field and decide approximately what I
wanted to do; I'd line up prospects in
the form of a list of firms in my field
and their executives; then I'd go after
them. The idea would be systematically
to canvas the field. The little fellows
could be called on personally, the big
shots might have to be contacted by
letter first, with the purpose of obtain-
ing the necessary interview, unless of
course, my rich uncle smoothed the
way by a telephone call first.
Unless you have that sort of a drag,
it would be well to steer clear of the
big plants this summer. There are a
flock of little concerns, however, that
might welcome the scientific viewpoint
of the college trained man, and who
might not be such sticklers for seniority
classifications. I know of a small paint
plant, for example, that found real value
in putting students in the laboratory.
They kidded the boys about their slide
rules, but admitted the "slip stick"
speeded up formulation calculations. It
doesn't pay, however, to take oneself
too seriously in this regard, and it
would be best to acknowledge ignorance

There are three kinds of students
who will get jobs this summer: the boys
who have a drag; the go-getters who
can't be discouraged by the first ten or
twenty turndowns; and the lads who
know just exactly what they want to
do when they graduate and who are
bent on getting a practical background
for that chosen field. The rest of the
gang will be up at the cottage.

Authority on Underground Water Resources
Member firm
Shoecrafi. Drury and McNamee. Engineers
•As a part of a recent study and ap-
praisal of the underground water re-
sources available to the city of Ann
Arbor some interesting facts have been
disclosed. These concern the effect upon
the mineral qualities and particularly
the hardness of underground waters by
the continued draft of la-ge pumping
stations. The hardness of underground
water where no large supplies are de-
veloped is usually materially increased
when a heavy draft is applied to the
underground sources. The amount of
lag between the draft and its effect upon
the hardness and the fact that the hard-
ness is reduced by reduced pumping
have been shown quite clearly by the
local studies.
All of the qualities of natural waters
are acquired and again lost in their
passage through the hydrologic cycle of
precipitation from the clouds to the
earth, flow or storage on or in the earth,
use by plants and animals and return
by evaporation to the clouds. Even
during precipitation water absorbs oxy-
gen, carbon dioxide, smoke and dust
from the atmosphere. In its course over
and through the ground
it absorbs in much
greater degree some
of the mineral and or-
ganic matter of which
the earth's crust is
composed. In the re-
turn to the clouds by
evaporation, these dis-
solved and suspended
constituents are left
behind.
Important among
those qualities found
in underground waters is the con-
tent of dissolved mineral matter com-
monly called hardness, that quality
characterized by the consumption of
soap in the water prior to the forma-
tion of a lather and by the deposition
of scale and sludge when the water is
boiled. This quality is imparted to
water by the carbonates, bicarbonates,
sulphates and chloride of calcium and
magnesium principally, and in less de-
gree of iron and aluminum. These min-
eral products are dissolved by the water
wherever the opportunity occurs along
its course. Limestone (calcium carbon-
ate), dolomite (calcium and magnesium
carbonates), and magnesite (magnesium
carbonate) are natural minerals that
contribute to the hardness of water, par-
ticularly in the presence of carbon di-
oxide gas in solution, by which their
solubility is greatly increased. Other
rrck products such as gypsum (calcium
sulphate) are naturally very soluble
and contribute in large degree to the
dissolved impurities of any water that
comes into contact with them. In a
ft/5
fttf
/ta
Ca/endar ttars
glaciated region where underground
waters occur in the glacial grist as they
do about Ann Arbor, these rock ma-
terials are present in their crushed or
powdered forms as gravels, sands, silts
and clays.
The fact that the hardness of water
is reduced by boiling has led to the
popular classification of hardness as
"temporary" or "permanent." Tempo-
rary hardness is that hardness removed
by boiling and is due to the bicarbonates
of calcium and magnesium. The effect
of boiling is to drive off the carbon
dioxide changing the bicarbonates to
carbonates which are practically insol-
uble and so are precipitated from solu-
tion. Such a product is commonly visible
in the household teakettle. Permanent
hardness is that hardness not affected
by boiling and is due principally to the
sulphates and chlorides of calcium and
magnesium.
The opportunity presented by con-
tact of water with soluble rock ma-
terials directly affects the amount of
minerals carried in solution. Undis-
turbed waters in the underground strata
circulate very slowly
on their way to some
ultimate outlet. But
where waters are heav-
ily pumped, increased
velocities are induced
especially about the
pumped area, the
water table is lowered
and some deep-lying
waters are probably
drawn upward and
brought within the in-

Ask the average man what the func-
tion of a public service commission is
and invariably he will reply, "to reduce
rates." Ask your favorite politician the
same question and unless human nature
has vastly changed since this was writ-
ten the reply will boom forth, "to reduce
rates" and of course "to protect the
public.'' It is common knowledge that
"one denial of a rate reduction receives
a ton of adverse criticism as compared
with an ounce of commendation when
a rate reduction is authorized."1 It is
little wonder that our commissioners be-
come "trigger-shy" after hearing them-
selves denounced day in and day out
by politicians currying to popular favor.
The popular conception of utility regu-
latory bodies seems to be that they are
set up with the sole purpose of reduc-
ing rates at every whim of an often
unreasoning public.
Before attempting to correct this
mistaken notion let us retrace our steps
a little and discover just how the pres-
ent system of utility regulation by state
commissions came about.
In the development of the electric
power industry the service was primar-
ily local. The utility normally secured
the right to operate and to make use
of the streets through a franchise from
the governing body of the city. As the
companies grew it became a simple mat-
ter to control the city officials. Corrup-
tion was the order of the day and in
some cases the utilities openly bought
the city council.-

GEORGE W. MALONE '37E
During this period the services of the
utilities continued to expand and spread
across municipal boundaries through
reorganization. At the same time public
indignation was being aroused over the
corruption and graft revealed by nu-
merous investigations. As a consequence,
in 1907 New York and Wisconsin each
created the first public service commis-
sions. Other states followed suit until
in 1913 twenty-four states had commis-
sions and the movement rapidly spread
until all of the states except Delaware
had created a commission with some
power of control over some of the utili-
ties.
As to the character of the regulation;
40 states have jurisdiction over service
standards; 40, over certificates of con-
venience and necessity; 32, over uni-
form accounting; 29, over security is-
sues; 21, over inter-corporate contracts
and 27, over acquisition of stock by the
utilities. The fact that commissions are
constantly alive to the changing char-
acter of utility ownership is brought out
by the fact that the last three of the
above items give the commissions some
measure of control over the holding
companies and in 20 of the states. This
jurisdiction was created in the past two
or three years. Supplementing regula-
tion of the state commissions is the au-
thority of the federal government over
the interstate business of the utilities.
The discussion here however will be
confined to state commissions which
make up the far more important phase
of utility regulation.
Looking at the above brief survey of
the extent of regulation it would appear
that commission regulation, while not
uniform, seems reasonably extensive.
Why then the perpetual howling of the
politico-wolf? An example of the loose
and irresponsible statements common to-
day is the following observation made
on the floor of the National House of
Representatives: "Does not the gentle-
man think that the fact that the public
utilities commissions have not done
anything toward reducing rates (mean)
that they will not do anything?" (Con-
gressional Record, 1st. session, 74th
Congress, page 1925, Feb. 12, 1935.)
This statement was made by a repre-
sentative from California and though he
can hardly be expected to be informed
as to what had happened in his own
state it is rather amusing to point out
that his state commission in 1934
effected reductions in rates of public
utilities amounting to $3,985,000. More-
over during the 13-year period prior to
the time that the above observation was
made this same California commission
effected reductions totaling $77,569,864.
And the cost of the commission to the
state during the same period was only
$6,279,640. "Considering the reductions
as cumulative and continuing, they
amount to $666,923,612 giving a unit
saving per dollar of expenditures of
$106.20." Not a bad investment. The
California Congressman and other
critics of state commissions might do
well to ponder over the following facts:
"In the single year of 1934, the com-
missions in 24 states were instrumental

electric, gas, and telephone utilities to
the enormous amount of $45,543,048."*
A rather pleasant "failure."
It is irresponsible statements such
as that made by our California friend
that are the cause of much unwarranted
hostility toward the state commissions.
The public thinks only in terms of
rates. It is not interested and has no
concept of "fair return upon fair value,"
and "reproduction cost new less depre-
ciation," and "prudent investment theo-
ries of rate-making," "going value" and
depreciation allowances. And when
office-seeking politicians are loud in
their promises to " 'rip Hell' out of the
public utilities, reduce rates, force ex-
tensions of service, and cut the salaries
of utility officials down to section-hand
wages, etc., etc.""' the average man
listens eagerly, hoping some small sav-
ing will come his way. Utility-baiting is
a favorite and often profitable sport of
the modern office-seeker. But, when the
politician gets into office he more often
than not finds that he can't carry out
his high-sounding campaign promises.
He finds that the law, at least, recog-
nizes that the utilities have rights and
that these rights must be protected from
the unreasoning demands of the public.
He finds, further that the law prevents
him from forcing the utility into bank-
ruptcy in order to satisfy the unjust and

prejudiced element of the public. What
then? The average taxpayer feels that
he has been tricked. The newspapers
take up his cause and clamor that our
now "toned-down" politician has be-
come a "tool of the utilities" and that
"commission regulation has failed."
Other politicians, always alert to popu-
lar emotions loudly "view with alarm"
the deplorable fact (according to them)
that the commissioners have become
"tools of the giant monopoly"—because
they usually insist on drawing the line
at confistication of private property in
order to appease the everlasting politi-
cal hunger for lower rates. (See Febru-
ary Technic for a discussion of the
"exhorbitancy" of electric rates in the
United States.)
The commission system of regulation
has proven to be by far the best system
yet devised. It has effected millions of
dollars saving annually in every state
in the Union (except Delaware which
has no commission), it has effected these
savings under very unfavorable condi-
tions—having both the public and the
utilities to please, if it satisfies one, it
antagonizes the other. However there
are serious flaws and imperfections in
this basically sound method of regula-
tion. The disadvantages of public own-
ership were pointed out in the March
Technic but unless the imperfections
in the regulatory system are corrected
some form of public ownership is bound
'to ensue after a period of years, with
the consequent degredation and debase-
ment of the high quality of service and
standards of efficiency set up by the pri-
vate utilities. It will be only then that
the public will realize the hollowness of
their victory in the fight for "low
rates." Let us avoid such a disagreeable
experience by correcting the imperfec-
tions NOW.
The fundamental defects may be
easily discussed under the following
headings:" 1. Organization and person-
nel; 2. Appropriations; 3. Rate mak-
ing.
1. Organization and personnel—The
average ability of commission members
is far below the requisite standards.
Commission appointments have too
often been made as rewards for political
service, or, if popularly elected, vote-
getting ability has too often been re-
garded as the first qualification. Conse-
quently many commissions have suffered
from low grade members causing lack
of initiative, too many "political rates,"
and too much subordination of public
interest for political expediency.
2. Appropriations—Rate making is
not all there is to public utility regula-
tion. Honest regulation is a complex
judicial-administrative process, the broad
scope of which is not recognized by the
general public. In general, typical duties
may be grouped under the following
heads:
* The majority of this analysis of the defects of the
commission system were taken from "Primary Defects
in Public Utility Reflation" by H. Wright, vice-
chairman Special Committee on Public Utilities. Ohio

utility business.
2. Fixing rates, granting reparations
for excess charges, making valuations of
utility property for rate-making pur-
poses, and condemnation.
3. Supervising service and service
conditions, including matters involving
public safety and the prevention of un-
reasonable discrimination between public
utility patrons.
4. Supervising and checking account-
ing methods.
5. Approving security issues of the
utilities.
6. Regulating competition between
th? utilities themselves.
A glance at the above abbreviated
list of responsibilities of the commissions
shows what a Herculean task is con-
stantly confronting them. It
could, however, be easily and
efficiently administered except
for one thing—they are grossly
under financed. Commission
salaries are too small in most
states to attract men of the
highest caliber. The entire
working organizations are inad-
equate and underpaid. It would
seem that when the state leg-
islatures created the commiss-
ions they bestowed upon them
the motto, "plenty of work but
little pay."
"The legislative bodies have
not hesitated to impose new
burdens on the commissions
and to give them new du-
ties and responsibilities. At the very
same time, however, they have been
amazingly derelict in fulfilling their
obligations to the public to make effec-
tive commission regulation possible
through adequate and increased appro-
priations. Not only have they been nig-
gardly as a rule; in some states they
have actually starved the public service
commission into impotency."T
3. Rate-making—One of the "storm-
centers" of the present hostility to the
system of regulation has been the delays
in rate-making. Rate making is essen-
tially a problem of business economics
but most of the commissions have been
tied hand and foot by useless statutory
material concerning technical procedure
which is almost impossible to untangle.
When this highly technical commission
and court procedure is practiced by un-
; Ibid pg. 339.
derfinanced and politico-minded com-
missions it can easily be seen that the
results are little short of disastrous.
And as a result of the necessary appeals
to the state and Federal court with the
consequent long drawn out litigation it
is no wonder that public confidence in
the commissions is shaken.
Look at the items in the preceding
column. What factor is common to all
of them? Who creates the commissions?
The state legislatures. Who is supposed
to set standards for experience and abil-
ity for the commissioners and formulate
the procedure of the commission? The
state legislatures. What gentlemen are
particularly vociferous especially at elec-
tion time about the "failure" of the state
commissions to "protect the public in-
terest"? These same members of the
state legislatures that have failed to
formulate adequate standards of per-
sonnel, failed to appropriate sufficient
funds to give the commission even
minimum ease in meeting their obliga-
tions, failed to remove the unnecessary
and useless red tape in procedure. Only
one conclusion is possible; the respon-
sibility for regulatory failures under
these stressing conditions rests squarely
upon the governor and the legislatures.
No amount of political ballyhoo can
hide this fact, and until the general
public is cognizant of it, we shall con-
tinue to see public confidence shaken by
conditions directly caused by their rep-
resentatives in state and national legis-
latures—not by dishonesty on the part
of the utilities or the often high-minded
but grossly handicapped commissioners.
In this brief and inadequate series we
have attempted to point out the follow-
ing ideas worthy of further considera-
tion:
1. Electric rate comparisons prove
nothing. Each rate is a local problem
determined by local conditions.
2. The national government has a
queer illogical power policy. It tries to
hammer down electric rates, one of the
smallest items of the family budget, and
at the same time do everything under
the sun to raise the prices of clothing,
rents and foodstuffs, the largest items.
3. Compare the ever increasing bur-
den of taxation with the constantly de-
creasing electric rates.
4. The T.V.A. and the other power
projects are inefficiently run systems at
best, dishonest "yardsticks" and huge
wasteful memorials to a great, but un- fortunate spending spree—who
will pay for it?
5. Municipal ownership,
much better than national
power projects, is vastly infer-
ior to private utilities, but a
worthwhile, though seldom ne-
cessary, threat to exploitation
by private utilities.
6. Regulation of public utili-
ties by the commission system
has its short-comings but it is
the best system yet devised and
any system is greatly preferable
to the inefficiency and dishon-
esty of public operation. More-
over the imperfections may be
remedied by honest revisions of
standards and appropriations
by the state legislatures—who, incident-
ally, caused the flaws.
Do not accept the above statements
as you read them. Investigate. You will
find, as the writer has found, that the
demagogue politicians have confused
the issue, falsified the record and baffled
the people. Government in business has
been a record of a succession of fail-
ures. The true function of government
is to regulate, control and protect—not
to participate in operation. Private in-
itiative has brought the utilities of this
country to their high plane of superior-
ity over the utilities in any other coun-
try and it is this same progressiveness
of private initiative coupled with honest
and vigilant government supervision
that will bring the rebirth of the future
confident and creative America—unfet-
tered by false "-isms."

of a six-story building half a block away! This giant earth
mover weighs 3Y&gt; million pounds and travels over the ground
at a rate of lYz miles per hour. A pull of 320,000 pounds,
enough to lift a steam passenger locomotive, forces the huge
dipper up through the earth. The 102}4-foot boom and 69-
foot dipper stick give this new machine an operating radius
of nearly 112 feet and a dumping height of 68J 2 feet. In two
passes this shovel can fill a standard 50-ton railroad hopper
car. With an operating cycle of one minute, it can fill 30
standard hopper cars in an hour. And, on the end of its long
dipper stick is a 32-yard dipper which heaping full will carry
35 cubic yards. So big is this dipper that a large sedan can
be driven in with ample room to open the doors on both sides.
The length from the door latch to the points of the teeth is
17 feet.
But, what is perhaps more unusual about this dipper than
its tremendous size is the fact that it is made largely of alum-

ORATOR
Robert A. Lowe, modest, unassum-
ing engineering senior, hails from the
city of Buffalo, New York. The begin-
ning of Bob's interest in mechanical
engineering dates back to the days
when he attended Buffalo-Lafayette
High School. Afternoons and Saturdays,
as well as summer vacations were spent
in the plant of a Buffalo heating and
ventilating concern. Lowe found this
work very absorbing and decided to im-
prove his chances for advancement by
studying a course in mechanical engi-
neering at the University of Michigan.
His activities, however, are not con-
fined to studies alone. In his own words
"extra curricular activities are a fine
thing." Though Bob has found it nec-
essary to work for his board, he has
found time to take an active part in
the activities of
Sigma Rho Tau,
Stamp Speakers
Society. He is
nowapublic
speaker extra-or-
dinare, master of
the art of the re-
conteur, and ora-
tor extempore.
He has taken
part in many of
the debates with
debate teams from Detroit and the
Ypsi girls, and has played a large part
in the success of the local chapter of
Sigma Rho Tau in these debates. Bob's
outstanding qualities as a speaker won
him his selection to the associate mem-
bership of the Stump Speakers Society
in his freshman year and to full mem-
bership in his sophomore year. His
continued excellent work was rewarded
by his selection to the presidency of
that society in this, his senior year. He
was also a member of the Varsity Glee
Club for two years, but found it nec-
essary to drop out under the pressure
of a heavy schedule of studies.
Lowe's favorite hobby is bridge, in
fact he likes the game so well he sets
Friday evening aside as "bridge night"
and will let nothing interfere.
After graduation Bob expects to be
re-employed by the Buffalo heating
and ventilating concern.

HONOR STUDENT
"Winner never quits, and the quit-
ter never wins;" is the motto of Ken-
neth Mosier. Today Mosier has achieved
the distinction of being one of the most
liked fellows and brilliant students on
the campus. As a youngster he dreamed
of being an inventor and his early am-
bition has only been modified slightly.
His future will lie either in research or
sales engineering.
In his freshman year Mosier was
elected to Phi Eta Sigma, then became
vice-president of Sophomore class a
year later. In his junior year being both
a genial gentleman and scholar, Tau
Beta Pi claimed him. Recently Kenneth
received an invitation to join Phi Kap-
pa Phi, one of the highest honors any
student on the campus can achieve. He
is also member of the Engineering
Council and Scabbard and Blade.
Last summer, he says, was one of the
most exciting he has ever spent. As a
member of the R.O.T.C., Ken went to
Aberdeen, Md., for summer training.
Having a car he was able to do a little
traveling to New York, Philadelphia,
Baltimore and Washington, D.C. On
one occasion he was found by traffic
policemen on a lonely state highway
with the army's ammunition stored in
his car. The police didn't believe his
story, but he was finally cleared of
much suspicion by appearing at state
camp in Philadelphia.
Kenneth is very much puzzled about
a certain incident. Last year he met a
girl who is a member of the Chi Omega
Sorority. For some reasons or other he
discontinued his visits there and saw
no more of the
girl. However,
last Friday Ken-
neth received a
package of bird
seed from the
Chi Omega So-
rority. He is so
puzzled a'bout
this package and
its meaning that
he is pleased to
accept any ideas
on the matter.
As much as Mosier likes Ann Arbor,
he hopes to work in a large city.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


There are about school quite a num-
ber of "urban hermits"—fellows who,
after sitting next to other men in class
i'or a whole semester, still don't know
their neighbor's names. You know who
they are—you see them every day.
They come dashing into the classroom
and immediately open the book hastily
to review the day's lesson before class
starts. At the end of the class they
gather up an armful of books and are
off to another class to repeat the same
procedure.
These "urban hermits'' know no one
or nothing—nothing outside the book.
Their isolation is doubtless prompted
by the commendable intention of being
well prepared in their school work, but
they are overlooking the equally im-
portant factor of getting along with
other people. Men who are out in the
world making a living don't pass their
fellows by in an oblivious dream. They
step right up, offering a hand, and say,
"My name's Jones, what's your's?" If
you are one of these "urban hermits"
'snap out of it" or you may find that
|you have prepared yourself scholasti-
cally to no avail, for you will not know
anyone to whom you can sell your
ideas, nor will you know how to per-
suade others to hire your knowledge.

TALK TO YOURSELF
In a recent address before a group
of personnel men and college professors
Mr. B. K. Swartz, author of "But
That's Not Engineering," in last month's
Technic, said that "One of the biggest
jobs that an engineer has is that of
teaching others." No matter where in
the field of engineering you may go
(design, construction, or operation) you
»ill have to explain to laborers, drafts-
men and to your assistants what to do,
how to do it, and when and why it
should be done.
"To teach a dog tricks, you have to
know more than the dog"—to teach
workmen you have to know the tech-
nology of the various engineering de-
vices that these workmen-pupils work
with. But, just as important as the
principles and their applications is
knowing how to put your knowledge to
work through other hands. You must be
able to put textbook discussions into
common, every-day terms. When you
read the text put every sentence into
your own words—simple words. Talk
each operation and process over with
yourself until you have put it in words
that make it seem childishly simple in
principle. Then, if you can learn to
speak with a fair degree of fluency, you
will be able to teach your subordinates
the what's and how's and when's and
why's of the many machines and opera-
tions that an engineer has to "run."
Until you become a teacher you will
remain a transitman, or a draftsman,
or an assistant operator on a filter-

WHAT DO ENGINEERS READ?
The engineer is traditionally de-
scribed as a man absorbed in his own
special interest and having a very nar-
row and limited contact with those out-
side his own fascinating, but restricted
world. We are continually told that we
must broaden—that we must read.
Today engineers are realizing the
value of cultural development and are
reading more in all fields of culture.
The Report of the Investigation of En-
gineering Education 1923-1929 gives
some interesting figures compiled from
questionnaires sent to 3,933 recent
graduates from engineering colleges in
the United States and Canada. These
3,933 men were asked to state "those
subjects of a cultural nature within
which they had continued interest after
leaving college. No definition of the
word cultural was given, but each grad-
uate listed his subjects of interest spon-
taneously." The subjects listed were
divided into four groups—economics,
literature, arts and miscellaneous. The
largest group is that dealing with busi-
ness, and includes economics, law, ac-
counting, and business administration.
This group constitutes 28% of the to-
tal. Next in popularity—24.8/4—is the
group containing English literature and
public speaking. History, philosophy
and psychology occupy the third place
as 18.5% of the whole. Fine arts makes
up 3.8%; science, 3%; and languages,
2.6%. A miscellaneous group of educa-
tion, journalism, geography and a host
of other subjects is the remaining
18.4% of the engineers reading.
ooo
SAFETY—WHY NOT?
The watch word of industry is safe-
ty, yet, outside the few "don'ts" and
cautions in laboratory and shop courses,
engineering students learn nothing of
accident prevention. To modern indus-
try accidents represent a large item of
cost—the losses from delay, repairs and
compensation to injured laborers mount
up rapidly. Every superintendent is ex-
pected to know and practice the prin-
ciples of safety.
Behind every sound measure for acci-
dent prevention are two fundamental
principles. Adequate safeguards must be
provided, and the entire personnel must
be taught and encouraged to work safe-
ly. Adequate safeguards include any
equipment from guardrails to goggles.
Moving machinery, and hot apparatus
and piping must be shielded. Workmen
must be protected from dangerous work
by gloves, aprons, goggles, safety shoes
and a variety of other articles of per-
sonal safety equipment. And, it must
be pointed out that safety devices will
not always prevent accidents from hap-
pening, but will usually keep minor
mishaps from developing into major
catastrophies. Too often these safety
devices lead workmen, thinking them-
selves protected, to take unwarranted
risks. Men must be shown the right
way and the safe way to do a job, and
that the safe way is the right way. The
supervisor-engineer must constantly re-
mind his men of safety and encourage
them in safe practices.

THE 23rd PSALM
OF AN ENGINEER'S SWEETHEART
Verily I say unto you, marry not an engineer.
For an engineer is a strange being, and is possessed of many
evils.
Yea, he speaketh eternally in parables which he calleth
formulae,
And he wieldeth a big stick which he calleth a slide-rule,
And he hath only one bible, a handbook.
He thinketh only of stresses and strains, and without end
of thermodynamics.
He showeth always a serious aspect, and picketh his seat
in a car by the springs therein and not by the damsel.
He does not know a waterfall except by its horsepower,
nor a sunset except that he must turn on the light, nor
a damsel except by her live weight.
Always he carrieth his books with him, and he entertaineth
his sweetheart with steam tables.
Verily, though his sweetheart expecteth chocolates when he
calleth
She openeth the package but to disclose samples of iron ore.
And he kisseth her only to test the viscosity of her lips.
For in his eyes there shineth a far away look that is
neither
Love nor longing—rather a vain attempt to recall a
formula.
There is but one way to his heart, and that is Tau Beta Pi,
and
When his damsel writeth of love and signeth with crosses,
he
Taketh these symbols not for kisses, but rather for unknown
quantities.
Even as a boy he pulleth a girl's hair to test its elasticity.
But as a man he discovereth different devices; For he
counteth the vibrations of her heartstrings; And he seek-
eth ever to pursue his scientific investigations even his
own heart flutterings he counteth as a vision of beauty,
and enscribeth a formula.
And his marriage is as a simultaneous equation involving
two unknowns, and yielding diverse results.
—The Annapolis Log.

To be added to the lore of our nocturnal life is the story
of the taxi-cab driver who was hailed by a speakeasy door-
man the other night. The doorman escorted four men to the
voiture, arranged them carefully within and then instructed
the chauffeur:
"The man on the left goes to ... Park avenue, the one
next to him to ... East Sixty-fifth, the one on the left front
seat to ... West End, and the other . . . Riverside Drive."
The chauffeur nodded understandingly and drove away.
In a few moments he was back, beckoning to the doorman.
''Say buddy," he said, "would you mind sortin' these
guys out again? I hit a bump on Sixth Avenue."
—New Yorker.
A college magazine is a great invention.
The college gets all the fame,
The printer gets all the money,
And the staff gets all the blame.
—Lehigh Burr.
The girdle manufacturer lives on the fat of the land.
—De Laval Monthly.
"Do you use India ink?"
"No, I patronize home industries."
"Boy, I'm scared! I just got a letter from a man telling
me he'd shoot me if I didn't stay away from his wife."
"Well, all you have to do is stay away from his wife."
"Yeah, but he didn't sign his name."
—Kansas Engineer.

fluence of the pumps. All of these
factors naturally tend to increase the
solution of rock materials in the water.
One of the important sources of water
now supplying the city of Ann Arbor is
the Steere Farm well field. Many years
ago flowing wells were known and local-
ly utilized for the irrigation of truck
gardens in that vicinity. For the most
part the water came from flowing wells
EO that the amount taken from the
ground was comparatively small and
really in the nature of an overflow. The
need for an increased supply of water
for the city directed attention to this
field as a source and ultimately a sta-
tion was built and put in operation in
July of 1919. Since that date a part of
the city's supply has been drawn from
this source.
The earliest analysis to be found for
the Steere Farm water is dated 1904,
at which time the total hardness, as
CaCO:1, was about 180 parts per mil-
lion. Oth?r analyses in 1912 and 1913
showed a hardness of about 200 parts
per million. Since the placing in oper-
ation of the pumping station in 1919,
analyses have been made with sufficient
frequency to permit a real study of
trends. In 1919 the total hardness was
about 220 parts per million, by the end
of 1920 about 300 parts per million,
and in 1922 about 370 parts per mil-
lion, rising from that date until in 1932
it was about 450 parts per million.
Since 1932, the trend appears to be
slightly downward and the probable
average total hardness at the present
time is about 430 parts per million. The
accompanying chart represents the
chronological trends of hardness graphi-
cally. The two components of total
hardness, namely the carbonate or tem-
porary hardness, and noncarbonate or
permanent hardness show a similar rise
and fall but of less degree.
On the solid linegraph is plotted the
trend of the average rates of pumpage
by years. When the station was first
started in 1919, the average draft from
the well field was little more than 1
million gallons per day. The general
trend from 1919 to 1928 rose to a value
at the latter date of more than 3.5
million gallons per day. Since 1928 the
trend was downward until 1933 then
slightly upward to the present time.
The variation in pumping rates is the
obvious explanation of the rising and
falling trends of hardness. Whereas the
first large draft from the well field was
taken in 1919, the hardness of the sup-
ply does not appear to have reached
anything like a steady trend until about
1922, indicating a lag of about three
years. The highest rates of pumpage
from the field occurred in 1928 but th;
trend of hardness continued upward un-
til 1931 or 1932, some three or four
years later. Since 1932 the trend ap-
pears to be slightly downward and may
be expected to continue in that direc-
tion for several years if pumping con-
tinues at the lower rates.
A lag of three or four years between
pumping and its effect upon quality is
quite reasonable. The catchment area
for the well field is approximately ten
square miles in extent and the general
distance of travel of the water may be
as much as two or three miles. If the
water travels at a rate of 10 feet per
day (a reasonable average for under-
ground waters) it would require about
1,600 days or about three years to
traverse a two-mile course.
The evidence disclosed by the local
studies is a very practical demonstra-
tion of the oft-repeated warning that
wells should not be pumped too heavily
not only because of the effect upon
their quantitative yield but also because
this practice may be expected to result
in a depreciation of quality.
CONTEMPORARY
ALCHEMIST
Deep in the basement of the East
Physics building can be found prepara-
tions for the installation of a gigantic
structure which is to be the very last
word in equipment for atomic bombard-
ment—the largest cyclotron in thi
world. The construction of this com-
plicated piece of apparatus, capable of
producing potentials of over 15,000,000
volts, is under the supervision of Asso-
ciate Professor James M. Cork. Pro-
fessor Cork, together with Professor E.
O. Lawrence of the University of Cali-
fornia, has the distinction of being the
first to achieve the alchemist's ultimate
goal of transmuting a lower metal into
gold. Last summer and fall while study-
ing and experimenting with the cyclo-
tron at the University of California, it
was found that one of the end products
formed by bombarding platinum with
deuterons was gold. The immediate aim
of Professor Cork and his associates is
the disintegration of elements, which
should yield information concerning the
ultimate structure of matter. In addi-
Professor James M. Cork
tinn, the neutrons emitted by the bom-
barded substance are worthy of study
because of the similarity of their action
on living organisms to that of X-rays.
From a more practical point of view he
knows that a means for producing
radioactive substances would prove to
be of great value to physicians. He esti-
mates that the cyclotron will be com-
pleted and ready for operation in two
months' time.
Before becoming interested in the
cyclotron, Professor Cork's research ac-
tivities rested largely in the field of X-
rays. He is responsible for the accurate
measurement of many of the shorter
wave lengths in the X-ray spectra, and
he has made accurate measurements of
the spectra of longer X-ray wave
lengths by use of a ruled grating spec-
trograph. The results of this research
can be read in his dozen or more
papers concerning X-rays. Others of his
writings include two books: ilPyrom-

GRAPPLER
From Buffalo, next door to roaring
Niagara and its power houses, comes
the Engineering College's own power-
ful grappler, Bill Lowell, pride of
Coach Keen's mat team. Bill graduated
from Bennett High School in Buffalo in
1933, having distinguished himself in
football and having achieved something
of immortality as vice-president of his
graduating class.
Enrolling in Ann Arbor in Septem-
ber, 1933, Bill quickly found his way
to the Field
House and be-
gan depriving
h i s antagon-
ists of their
usual vertical
stance. His
ability to con-
vert his oppo-
nents into
statically in-
determinate
bodies and in-
to indiscrim-
inate hyper-
bolic functions
"Bill" Lowell won him his
Freshmen numerals.
During his Sophomore year he worked
out assiduously with Coach Keen and
received his Varsity letter in the first
part of his junior year. This year he
had a good deal of success, making a
favorable showing despite the fact that
he constantly wrestled ten pounds above
his weight. In view of this record Coach
Cliff Keen is counting on Bill to help
Michigan along in her Big Ten wres-
tling aspirations next season.
In school, Bill knows his way around
a slide-rule, as is manifested in his
scholastic record. He was elected to Phi
Eta Sigma his first semester here. In
the light of these various accomplish-
ments, Triangles have elected him to
membership and in the fall elections
Lowell earned a birth on the Engineer-
ing Council. Vocationally, Bill is aim-
ing right at what he wants; he is a
junior Mechanical and intends to spe-
cialize in Deisel Engines. Lowell is not
waiting for graduation to begin a prac-
tical acquaintance with his profession
but will spend this summer working in
a machine shop in Buffalo. Ambition
like that will not be denied—we are
confident of Bill's future success.

ENTERPRISER
The class of 1907 has good reason
to be proud of their classmate, Henry
Georg, for the fine job that he has done
since he left the University. Eighteen
years ago he formed the construction
company of Alloway and Georg, in
Spokane, Washington, and today be-
sides having erected many of Spokane's
impressive buildings, four of the north-
western states are dotted with grain
Henry Ccorg
elevators built by his company. During
his business career, Mr. Georg has had
to handle jobs which assumed propor-
tions in millions of dollars. For in-
stance, last year Alloway and Georg
built a grain elevator at Vancouver,
Washington, for the Pacific Continen-
tal Grain Company. This job alone ran
to a million and a quarter dollars, and
Mr. Georg had to do the figuring and
see the job through to completion. At
present he is erecting a gigantic pulp
mill for the Weyerhauser Paper Com-
pany. This job is estimated to cost
S4.000.000 and will employ four hun-
dred men for a period of fifteen months.
Mr. Georg still finds time, however,
to enter into community activities. He
headed the community chest drive in
1933, has presided over the local Boy
Scout Area Council, and is now serv-
ing on various boards for community
improvement. But for real relaxation,
he likes nothing better than to get away
from business activities, and indulge in
his favorite sports, hunting and fishing.

The Mechanical Engineering Department lays special emphasis on its belief that the function of the
laboratory is to provide actual contact, for the student, in the study of power plant machinery. He
sees how the equipment is constructed, he operates it, and is given instruction and practice in the
technique of testing such machinery. The laboratory also provides the facilities necessary for research
by the more advanced students when they seek to design new and better machines.
The Mechanical Laboratory consists of two sections. The ground floor unit contains the larger steam
engines and turbines, with their auxiliary equipment, the steam boilers, stationary internal combustion
engines, some of the hydraulic machinery, the air compressors and the refrigeration plant. The
second floor unit houses the fans, together with the small engines, all the steam turbines and one

MORE BRIGHT SPOTS ON THE GLOBE
'I THE mellow, golden-orange glow of sodium
lighting is springing up all across the continent.
The latest installation, the largest in the United
States, is located in the state of Washington.
Here sixty-six 10,000-lumen General Electric units
line almost three miles of the four-lane Pacific high-
way between Tacoma and Fort Lewis.
Less than three years ago the sodium lamp made its
first American appearance on a highway near
Schenectady. Today the largest installation is on
the Pacific coast, and the second-largest is at Lynn,
Mass., on the Atlantic. In between, highways,
bridges, traffic circles, and underpasses are being

X-RAY FOR ART'S SAKE
TS there a portrait of Great Uncle Ezra gathering
dust in the attic? It may pay to x-ray Uncle
before handing him over to the junkman, for behind
Ezra's imposing whiskers may be hiding the sister of
the Mona Lisa.
Not long ago, a portable G-E X-Ray Corporation
unit disclosed a valuable canvas by the seventeenth-
century artist, Goya, concealed under an apparently
worthless picture. More recently a New Orleans
painter and art expert has used the x-ray to discover
a genuine da Vinci signature beneath layers of
paint applied by a later and less-capable artist. A
sister painting to the newly found da Vinci recently
sold for a quarter of a million dollars.
The x-ray does more than discover lost Old Masters;
it tells how the great artists of the past worked. A
series of radiographs can disclose the full story of
their brushwork from the first rough sketch to the
last correction and afterthought. The art student of
today, by an intelligent use of the x-ray, is in a
position to take lessons from the geniuses of the
past.
NO CLICK!
r¥MIE life of the party, coming home with the
milkman, need no longer fear the betraying
click of the light switch if his house wiring includes
the latest electric switch developed in the G-E
Research Laboratory.
Two shallow chrome-steel cups, sealed together with
a strip of glass, form the two contacts. A ceramic
disk with a hole in it, and a few drops of mercury,
partly fill the enclosure between the cups. The
device is filled with hydrogen and sealed by welding.
In the "off" position, the hole in the disk is above the
mercury level. A rotation of twenty degrees to the
"on" position permits the mercury to flow through
the hole and make the electric connection.
The time-honored click of the switch is abolished.
In the laboratory in Schenectady, one of these
mercury switches has^lurned a 200-watt lamp on
and off some 65 million times in the last two years,
and there are no signs of wearing out or failure.

A TRIUMPH OF CHEMISTRY
MORE than a century has passed
since magnesium was first recog-
nized as an oxide of metal and later pro-
duced as a metal.
It is also a matter of record that out of
Germany came the first large scale pro-
duction of magnesium alloys—a devel-
opment of the World War.
A group of typical Dowmttal
castings
But, should the history of this lightest
of all structural alloys be written, The Dow Chemical
Company of Midland, Michigan, would occupy a
singular and honored place.
For, aside from being the sole producer of magnesium
alloys in this country, it is to the everlasting credit of
Dow chemists and technicians that this valuable metal
is now produced at a price making it available to all
industry.
Today, under the trade name of Dowmetal, Dow
magnesium alloys are bringing the great benefits of
lightness combined with toughness and strength to
countless products.
Being a full third lighter than aluminum and only a
quarter the weight of steel, it is obvious that the air-
craft industry became its first big user. Engine crank-
cases, landing wheels and many other
parts, large and small, are made of Dow-
metal. The recent stratosphere explora-
tions were made in Dowmetal gondolas.
Beginning there, the list broadens from
machinery to household appliances —
from truck bodies to camera parts, port-
able power tools, typewriters and a host
of other applications.
In addition to producing a range of alloys, Dow offers
a complete pre-fabrication service covering castings,
forgings, sheets, plates and extruded shapes. In addi-
tion, an engineering and technical staff is available
to cooperate with users in the practical and efficient
application of Dowmetal to their products or
equipment.
The commercial development of Dowmetal symbolizes
and parallels the successful 45-year history of The Dow
Chemical Company.
Manufacturing 250 separate and distinct products, The
Dow Chemical Company has risen to a respected
leadership through constructive and original research
and the fundamental objective of applying chemistry
as a means of making valuable materials cost less.

The modern physics laboratory might
well be called a land of magic, for in it
can be found apparatus so grotesque
and extraordinary as to make the tales
of Tom Swift and Ur. Fu Manchu look
medieval. At present Professor Cork
and his associates of the Physics De-
partment are constructing a piece of
equipment that is almost fantastic in
appearance. Called the cyclotron, it will
be one of the few of its kind in exist-
ence. The above picture and accom-
panying cuts show the various parts,
still in a stage of construction. Work
will be completed sometime before the
end of the semester. The cyclotron is
capable of doing what the alchemist has
been trying to do for centuries, namely
the transmutation of one element into
another. Also materials can be made
radio active. Using deuterons, a prod-
uct of ionization of "heavy'' hydrogen,
as the means of breaking up
the nucleus of any substance
desired, an oscillating cir-
cuit, and a strong uniform
magnetic field, a potential
of over 14,000,000 electron
volts will be reached. With
deuterons, which are the nu-
clei of heavy hydrogen, trav-
eling at tremendous speeds
through this potential, it is
possible to penetrate the
minute nucleus of any sub-
stance, shattering it and de-
stroying its former proper-
ties. Prof. E. O. Lawrence
of the University of Cali-
fornia was the first to perfect this meth-
od of disintegration. Professor Cork
worked with the cyclotron at California
last summer, and returned to build one
here this fall. At the present time sev-
eral other institutions are constructing
similar apparatus for carrying on the
work in nuclear physics. The cyclotron
here at the University is the largest
under construction. The design of the
field and the acceleration chamber will
give a final potential over twice as great
as any yet obtained. The greatest po-
tential reached to date is in the neigh-
borhood of 6,000,000 electron volts, at
the University of California.
In 1919 Rutherford performed the
first successful disintegration of an ele-
ment, by a physical process of driving
one type of an atom into another. The
nucleus, which is the innermost part of
an atom, ultimately determines the
H
The Core of the Huge Magnet Before Winding
chemical properties of an element, and
as all nuclei are positively charged,
enormous repelling forces occur when
two nuclei are brought very close to-
gether. The result is, that the nucleus
that is traveling, curves away from the
other. If one is to penetrate another it
must be traveling with sufficient kinetic
energy to overcome this repulsion.
Rutherford used as projectiles the most
energetic particles then known, the he-
lium nuclei—so called alpha particles—
spontaneously emitted by radium. These
were allowed to fall on nitrogen. Only
occasionally a direct hit was made, and
an alpha particle penetrated within a
nitrogen nucleus; the overstuffed body
immediately burst into two parts, one
a hydrogen nucleus and the other a nu-
cleus of oxygen.
Rutherford's experiments were only
the beginning. Because the high cost of
radium and the fact that
relatively few alpha particles
were emitted, the disintegra-
tions were only occasional.
Of late physicists have been
developing apparatus to ac-
celerate by electric means
large numbers of charged
particles, to be used as pro-
jectiles, such as protons or
deuterons. Theory indicated
that these particles might be
more effective as disintegra-
ftors than the heavier alpha
particles.
One way of accomplishing
this acceleration is to estab-

between two electrodes at the ends of
an evacuated tube, introducing the pos-
itively charged particle at the anode
and letting it be drawn to the cathode
by the electrostatic force. Considerable
success has rewarded these efforts and
several laboratories are now carrying
on nuclear disintegration experiments,
with proton or deuteron currents up to
100 microamperes, at potentials up to
600 to 1200 kilovolts. Several disad-
vantages limit the possibilities of this
method. The transformers and appara-
tus are bulky, large clearances have to
be allowed to prevent external flash-
over, and considerable trouble has arisen
from the high speed electrons punctur-
ing the glass or porcelain tubes.
With this as a background, Professor
Lawrence designed new apparatus, based
on an entirely new theory, which proved
to be very successful. His invention,
called the cyclotron, is by far the most
outstanding since the early discoveries
of Rutherford. The scheme is to allow
the particles to pass through a series of
hollow electrodes, a relatively low po-
tential source being successively con-
nected at the proper instant (by the
incorporation of a high freqency oscil-
lating circuit) to those two electrodes
between which the particle lies. The
final energy of the particle is equal to
that obtained from a single fall across
the potential of the source multiplied
by the number of such falls.
A large electromagnet plays a most
important part in this process. It pro-
duces a broad uniform field of about
22,000 gauss density between its pole
faces, which are flat and 36 inches in
diameter. When a charged particle
moves in such a uniform magnetic field
its path is bent in the form of an arc.
The method by which this is accom-
plished is as follows: a large evacuated
chamber is built to fit in between the
pole faces of the magnet, which are
about 3l/2 inches apart. The hollow
electrodes, shaped in the form of
semi-circular disks, two inches thick
and slightly smaller than the faces of
the magnet, constitute the paths which
the particles follow. They are spaced
% of an inch apart—straight edges to-
gether. This is the gap which the par-
ticles must jump.
The oscillator circuit is a push-pull,
tuned grid, tuned plate hook-up, run-
ning at about 20 meters wave length.
The six hot cathode mercury vapor
tubes are supplied by a three phase,
full wave rectified current at 10,000
volts. The tubes take a total of about
90 K.W., and are water cooled. The
circuit is capable of being tuned to op-
erate at the frequency required to change
the potential of the D's at the correct
time.
The construction of the magnet is of
very great interest. It stands nine feel
and four inches high, is over four feet
wide and over eleven feet long. Seventy-
nine tons of low metaloid iron went into
its construction. The average weight of
the slabs of which it is made is 10,000
pounds, the thickness of the yoke is two
feet. Two cylindrical poles, measuring
fifty inches in diameter and tapering to
36 inches, are wound with 5,400 turns
of copper band, and come within 3%
inches of each other on the inside. With
8 K.W. passing through the field a flux
density of 22,000 gauss is obtained. Al-
though it contains less steel than the
California magnet, and uses only one-
fourth the power, Prof. Cork's magnet
has twice as much copper, IS tons, in
the windings. Due to this and to the
fact that the other magnet is made of
cast steel, having poorer magnetic prop-
erties, the flux is much greater. The
total weight of copper and steel of the
Michigan magnet is, however, several
tons greater.
The two electrodes are connected to
the high frequency oscillator so that,
like the plates of a condenser, they are
charged alternately positively and neg-
atively in the neighborhood of 30 to 40
thousand volts with respect to the
ground. Heavy hydrogen is admitted
to the evacuated chamber, and is ion-
ized by the bombardment of electrons
from a hot filament, placed at the cen-
ters of the electrodes (called D's due
to their shape). The electrons are re-
pelled from the filament, which is
charged 2,000 volts negatively. The
electrons knock off an electron from the
heavy hydrogen atoms, leaving deuter-
ons, which carry positive charges and
contain the nuclei of the atoms.
The positive deuterons are drawn to
the plate, which at that instant happens
t) be negative. The magnetic field bends
the paths into arcs. After describing a
semi-circle in the negative D, the parti-
cle comes back to the gap between the
electrodes; if the frequency of the os-
cillator have been properly chosen, the
potentials of the plates have now been
reversed. The time it takes a deuteron
Specially designed demountable oscillator tube
used to feed high frequency A-C to the
alternating electrodes
to traverse this path can be readily cal-
culated. The time required to traverse a
semi-circular path of radius r, with a
IT r
velocity v is t --= . The centrifugal
v
force due to the curved path is Mv2/r,
where M is the mass of the particle.
This is equal to the centripetal force on
the deuteron, Hev, due to the magnetic
field H, where e is the charge of the
particle. Hence we have Mv2/r = Hev,
and solving for v and substituting it in
TrM
the equation for t we find that t = .
He
This is seen to be constant for a given
type of particle and a given field, and
is also seen to be independent of the
radius. At this instant potentials of the
D's have been reversed, the positive
deuterons jump across the gap between
the D's to the plate that is now nega-
tive, and increases its velocity due to
this fall. The result is that the radius
of the next semicircle is larger than the
first, and it again must come back to
the gap at the same length of time as
before. The potential of the plates has
again been reversed and the particle
again crosses the gap, working its way
out farther and farther towards the ex-
tremities of the D's on a spiral. The
gain in potential each time is 30 to 40
thousand volts. The final velocity is

X 10 ". It
is seen that the final speed is propor-
tional to the square of the radius, the
square of the charge of the particle, and
the square of the field strength, being
inversely proportional to the mass. With
the strong field and large radius the
final result is roughly 14 million electron
volts. Here at the University Professor
Cork has built a magnet which has
shown by test (o give a much stronger
field than any used as yet. The radius
of the D's is much larger, and as both
of these quantities increase the energy
of the particles in proportion to the
square, the ultimate potential will be
very much larger than any yet obtained.
The high speed deuterons upon reach-
ing the outer wall of the D's, pass out
through a slit, and the radius of their
path is slightly increased by an electro-
static deflecting field. This allows them
to clear the wall of the electrodes and
pass out of the evacuated chamber
through a thin but vacuum tight plat-
inum window, into the bombardment
chamber. This is where the materials
to be hit are placed.
Although the deuteron current is less
than those used in former methods, the
particles have a superior final energy.
This greater energy results in two ad-
vantages. First the greater energy en-
ables them to pierce farther into a sub-
stance; giving them a greater chance of
hitting a nucleus; second the probabili-
ty of disintegration after the nucleus has
been hit is much greater, rising with the
energy.
With a neucleus traveling at a speed
of 14,000,000 electron volts, it is capa-
ble of overcoming the tremendous re-
pelling forces between two nuclei, and
actually penetrate another nucleus. It
must be remembered that not all of the
deuterons will make a direct hit, yet a
sufficient number do to make the results
very satisfactory. The final result is
that the overstuffed nucleus bursts and
the properties of the element are changed
in one manner or another. Several re-
sults have been obtained in past experi-
ments. The substance is either changed
into other elements one or two steps up
or down on the atomic scale, or a nu-
cleus is formed which is not recognizable
as any of the standard isotopes of the
elements. In this case the element so
formed is radioactive, and will emit
gamma and beta rays similar to radium.
The cyclotron furnishes the best source
of alpha particles, protons, and deuter-
ons for science and medicine.
The uses of radio active substances
in medicine is almost unlimited, and the
same holds for chemistry, biology, and
other sciences. A vast new field has
been opened for science in the work on
nuclear physics.
The synthetic radio-active substances
obtained from the bombardment cham-
ber of the cyclotron have several ad-
vantages over Radium. In the first place
it will be possible to produce the syn-
thetic products cheaper than radium. It
will be possible to have a radio-active
substance in any form desired. For in-
stance, it may be possible to inject di-
rectly into a cancer a salt solution,
containing radiosodium, made by bom-
barding ordinary salt with deuterons.
As the half-life of radiosodium is only
15.5 hours, there is little danger that
the healthy body tissues will be dam-
aged. The normal sodium atoms or the
minute quantities of magnesium, into
which the radiosodium decays, would
not be harmful either. It is due to this
fact, that the half-life of these syn-
thetic radio-active substances is very
short, that it might be possible to use
them very extensively in medicine.
Already a good number of the 92
elements have been disintegrated by the
cyclotron. Platinum has been changed
into Gold, and Lithium into Helium.
The experiments that have been carried
on in the last few years have proven
that any element can be disintegrated.
The quantities, as yet, of the new ele-
ments formed have been small. The
process is also quite expensive, and the
labor required tremendous. However,
great steps have been taken in the ad-
vancement of nucl?ar physics. The fu-
ture cannot even be forecasted, it is so
uncertain. Physicists have hopes of be-
ing able to produce any element in
quantity in the near future, but how
far they can go beyond this can only
be imagined. Perhaps science is at the
threshold of harnessing the energy of
the atom. The field is still very new,
and the possibilities unlimited.

The recognition of
a fact is not always
the precursor to its
execution. I say this
to deflect the
thoughts of those
who may deduce
that the author of
these observations
considers himself a
prominent example
of the application of
the precepts he here-
with tenders. Be it understood, then,
that these observations are offered in
the spirit of helpfulness to those who
may profit from the errors of their pre-
decessors. And, now, to discuss some of
the aspects of the situation resulting
after the embryo engineer has obtained
his position.
Perhaps it would be well to mention,
in order to avoid subsequent confusion
of thought, that it is my intention to
discuss three phases of the new engi-
neer's position: his relation to his in-
feriors, his relations to his fellow work-
ers, and his relation to his superiors.
Let us consider first, then, his relation
to his inferiors.
Much has been written, and more has
been said, regarding the conduct of an
engineer fresh from college toward his
inferiors. By inferiors I mean, with no
disrespect, the various mechanics, tech-
nicians, draftsmen and, in general, the
non-college men who execute the work
the engineer requires. Perhaps it is not
proper to term them inferiors, but it
appears a short, all-embracing word
which conveys, in general, the sense in-
tended. It is not my intention at this
time to mull over the much publicized
attitude that a young engineer is apt to
adopt in these instances, but rather I
should like to say a few words regarding
the value and application of the prac-
tical knowledge and experience that this
class of person can supply. We may as-
sume, then, that he has the good sense
to enjoy a feeling of comradeship and
friendliness toward all with whom he
works.
Now, although I hold the Honor Sys-
tem of the University of Michigan in
high regard, and consider the system
of examination as annually conducted
an admirable and necessary function,
none the less it has been my observation
that there may be a carry-over of these
principles into industrial work which is
not conducive to the best results. It
would appear that some engineers upon
graduation feel that their work should
be carried on and advanced purely on
the basis of their own merit and efforts.
Although this spirit is an admirable one,
it can be carried too far. Not only can
he obtain help from
others, but this help
is invaluable in the
practical application of
any idea he may pos-
sess, and it is in cases
of this nature that the
experience and practi-
cal knowledge of his
subordinates is of such
immense value. Per-
haps this may best be
shown by an illustra-
tion. Let us take as an
instance, a chemical
engineer performing a
laboratory research on
a distillation problem.
Suppose he conceives
a particular design for
the column which he
presumes will effec-
tively perform the op-
eration expected. Now,
he may, of course,
simply present his de-
sign to the glass-blow-
er, request a model of
the column executed
in accordance with his
design, and proceed
entirely on the basis of his own ideas;
or he may pay a personal call on the
glass-blower and proceed with a conver-
versation somewhat as follows:
"Hello, Pete, how's the glass-blowing
department this morning?"
"Not so bad, not so bad, Frank."
"Say, Pete, I've got a glass-blowing
job here I'd like your advice on. You
see, I want a column made like this; I
thought perhaps you might have an idea
or two up your sleeve that might prove
of assistance?"
The reaction to this type of approach
is nine times out of ten a friendly and,
furthermore, a very productive one, and
I think that little need be said as to
which design will prove the better. Many
times the technician can call upon a vast
Industrial and Engineering Chemistry
The Technician will produce suggestions impossible for a college
man to conceive."

fund of previous experience which will
produce suggestions impossible for a col-
lege man to conceive. In conclusion,
then, before presenting ideas to your
superior, before executing a new idea,
before giving up a problem which seems
to have no answer, seek the information,
help and inspiration which the man on
the job is usually more than glad to
supply. Don't, however, overdo it and
become a nuisance.
Our second, and I think our most im-
portant, point is the relation of the new
engineer to his fellow-workers. I wish
to discuss this from a rather personal
point of view, since I have observed
several very unfortunate instances of an
unsatisfactory relation of this nature.
It is usual, when an engineer enters
a large industrial concern fresh from
college, for him to be introduced and
accepted into a friendly circle of the
other young engineers and chemists who
currently constitute the technical staff
of the institution. Quite frequently he
finds that this group live, eat and enjoy
their recreation together, and conse-
quently efforts are made to include him
in the group. Now this may cause a
situation which calls for thought. If the
newcomer be a hail-fellow-well-met, he
will accept and enjoy this extended
hand of friendship; but if he has an
introvertic turn to his nature, or if rfis
inclinations differ radically from those
of the average, he may find it extreme-
ly distasteful to find himself swung in-
to a type of existence which he may not
care for. Here is a dilemma: if he re-
main, he must either sacrifice his own
individuality, or—and this requires a
great deal of tact and insight—appear
to be "one of the gang," at the same
time participating in his personal activ-
ities without causing ill-feeling. This
course is extremely difficult, and often
requires the sacrifice of his own inter-
ests for those of the group. If, on the
other hand, he divorce himself entirely
and live elsewhere, he will find himself
nearly excluded from the group activ-
ities, and it will require the diplomacy
of an international diplomat to remain
on good terms with all, giving offence to
none. It is not my intention to propose
a solution for such a situation as this -
that is a matter for personal judgment—
but merely to indicate it for the unwary
who may readily find themselves in
awkward straits merely because they
lacked the foresight or experience to
anticipate them.
To conclude the discussion of this
point, lest any suspect that the ability
to maintain a comradely feeling toward
his fellow-workers—particularly toward
the older men who occupy a sort of a
semi-executive position,—is of little im-
portance, let me assure them that so
far is this from the actual truth, that
it conclusively, definitely and nearly al-
ways is the deciding factor in the hold-
ing of a position if there be some ques-
tion in the matter.
Finally, let us consider the relation
of the college graduate in his newly
acquired position to his superiors. Ye
engineers who have never read Elbert
Hubbard's "Message to Garcia," pro-
vide yourself with an idle half hour and
do so—then apply the precepts thereby
recommended to your superiors in in-
dustry. Without carrying the matter to
extremes, the less said the better. The
man who can reply to a long series of
instructions with a simple "Yes, Sir," or
at most a brief, intelligent question or
two (so I have been told!) is the dream
of executives.
In conclusion, may I remark that this
discussion is not intended to advise the
new job-holder what to do and how to
do it, but, rather, it comes as a tale of
woe from a fellow sufferer; and if it
causes thought to originate in connec-
tion with any of the points discussed,
the ends desired have been attained:
for, after all, good judgment, which ap-
pears to me to be nothing more than the
application of clear thought to a situa-
tion, is the answer to practically any
problem which may arise.

EDWARD YOUNG
Professor of Geodesy and Surveying
Fig. 4. If sufficient exposure is given to bring out highlight detail,
the shadows appear black.
With some professionals and skilled
amateurs photography is an art—with
the average amateur it should be a sci-
ence. Although some of the more ex-
perienced photographers have developed,
through long experience, what might be
termed an "exposure judgment," and
get results comparable to those obtained
by the beginners who calculate their
exposures from tables, curves and me-
ters, the average amateur should use the
best scientific methods to attain with
certainty the best results. The principal
control in photography is exposure.
Varying conditions of weather and sea-
son require variations in exposure. Dif-
ferent films require different exposures.
Frequently shutter speeds have to be
checked to determine whether the shut-
ter is giving the calibrated exposure.
These factors—the time of day and the
day of the year, the latitude of the
place, condition of the atmosphere,
speed and sensitivity of the film, speed
of the lens, the subject, and the adjust-
ment of the shutter—must be taken
into account in determining exposure.
This exposure we are investigating is a
product of two factors—the aperture
and the shutter speed. Varying the ex-
posure merely adjusts the conditions
inside the camera to those outside.
A knowledge of what constitutes a
good negative and of the relation of ex-
posure to the properties of the negative
is required to fully understand the prob-
lem of determining exposure. Keeping
in mind that the darkest portions of the
negative—that is the regions of maxi-
mum opacity—correspond to the maxi-
mum highlights in the subject, we may
say that a negative is a faithful repre-
sentation of the subject when its opaci-
ties are proportional to the light intensi-
ties reflected from the subject. Opacity
is the reciprocal of the transparency,
and the transparency is the ratio of
light incident on the film. Density is
defined as the amount of light stopping
substance in the negative and is equal
to the logu, of the opacity. A density
of 1 then means that the film has an
opacity of 10 and a transparency of
1/10: that is the film transmits only
1/10 of the light incident on it.
The simple statement that the 'nega-
tive densities must be proportional to
the light intensities,' does not tell the
whole story. It is found that a direct
proportion between density and light
intensity (or exposure) exists only over
a certain range of tones. This range of
tones that gives a perfect representa-
tion of the subject is called the latitude
of the emulsion of the photographic
plate or film. It is only when the range
of intensities reflected from the subject
lies within this latitude of the emulsion
that a faithful reproduction is obtained.
When the subject photographed has a
low range of tones there is considerable
leeway in making the exposure. But,
when the range of light intensities is
equal to the latitude of the emulsion,
the exposure must be exact. The deep-
est shadow must fall at one end of the
characteristic curve (Fig. 1), with the
maximum highlight at the other end.
In 1890, when Hurter and Driffield
were engaged in research on the speed
of photographic plates they made the
first determination of the characteristic
curve of photographic emulsions. Their
work resulted in a system of sensito-
metric investigation which bears their
names, the H. &amp; D. system. The H. &amp;
D. curve, (Fig. 1), shows the relation
between density and the logarithm of
the exposure. This curve may be divided
into three parts. All exposures falling
on the first portion of the curve (in-
creasing slope) are under exposed. The
period of correct exposure is represented
by the straight line section (constant
slope). On the last portion of the curve
(decreasing slope) lies the region of
over exposure. On the under exposed
section of the curve density increases
rapidly in comparison to the exposure.
The rate of increase of density with re-
spect to the exposure is a constant along
the straight section. In this section each
time the exposure is doubled there is an

correct exposure.

words, as the exposure increases in a
geometrical progression, the density in-
creases in an arithmetical progression.
On the straight section, the density is
directly proportional to the log of the
exposure. According to our definition
of a perfect negative the light intensities
reflected from the subject are propor-
tional to the opacities of the negative.
This condition is fulfilled when the ex-
posure lies on the straight part of the
density-log E curve where equal incri-
ments of log E give equal incriments of
density. When the exposure is increased
beyond the straight line section, the
density increases at a relatively slower
rate until finally a point is reached
where there is no increase in density.
This is what is known as the reversal
period. At this point increasing expos-
ure results in decreasing density.
The capacity of the film to separate

which at any point is . The

emulsion capacity in this respect is a
maximum on the straight portion of the
curve where the slope is a maximum.
The under exposed negative may be
characterized as having no detail in the
shadows, the result being a false ren-
dering of the subject. For this reason
a landscape scene
which has been un-
der-exposed appears
too harsh. If the
exposure falls on
the over-exposed
end of the curve the
negative is flat,
drab and uninterest-
ing. The shadows
possess too much de-
tail. The highlights
print grey and half-
tones only a shade
darker. The proper
gradation from
black to white is
lacking and a weak,
flat print results.
Fig. 5. Here the exposure is correct for the shadows, and the
background is invisible.
Fig. 2 shows negatives that have re-
ceived under, normal and over exposure.
The subject which was photographed on
a very dull clay contains a range of tones
less than 4-1. No. 4 negative was ob-
tained from the computed normal ex-
posure. The negatives nos. 1, 2 and 3
received more than the computed nor-
mal exposure while nos. 5, 6 and 7 re-
ceived less than the computed exposure.
No. 1 received 50.5 times the exposure
given to no. 7. It can be seen that the
density of no. 2 is greater than that of
no. 1. This may be due to the ineffi-
ciency of the shutter at maximum aper-
ture. All negatives received normal
development.
Exposure determines the maximum
density of the negative. Development
determines the relative densities of the
various areas. Since the same time of
development is required to reach any
given degree of contrast, little is gained
by prolonged development in the case
under exposure. Fog develops rapidly
in the shadows tending to lower the con-
trast as the development is prolonged.
With no exposure there would be no
density except that due to chemical fog.

and building, fair prints are obtained
on normal paper throughout the entire
range. Compare this scene with one hav-
ing dark woods in the foreground, bright
sky, distant mountains, and light re-
flected from a water surface. It is doubt-
ful if any emulsion has sufficient lati-
tude to record such a scene as the one
shown in Fig. 4. It is true that a suit-
able light filter would hold back some
of the blue light and lower the high
light intensity but since the negative is
only a stepping stone to the finished
print we find ourselves handicapped
with photographic papers having a char-
acteristic curve with little or no straight
portions, hence the subject is rendered
with severe loss in gradation at one or
both ends of the scale. That is to say,
if in making the print sufficient expos-
ure is given to bring out the highlight
detail, the shadows will be over exposed
and appear black as in Fig. 4. On the
other hand, if we make the exposure
suitable for the shadows, the distant
mountains will be scarcely visible in the
print. This is illustrated by Fig. 5. Had
the negative in this case been removed
from the developing solution as soon as
the highlights reached their maximum
printing density, the detail would have
been preserved to a large extent, the
effect being a crowding on the scale of
gradation. This brings up the question,
for what shall we expose, the shadows
or the highlights? To expose for the
shadows would be correct provided the
highlights do not give to the film more
light than it can stand. This would not
be satisfactory in the case of a portrait
as here it is necessary to expose for the

bling the suspension cables, like most of
the features of the entire structure, con-
fronted the engineer with new problems
in the way of bigness and made neces-
sary unprecedented methods.
A Unique View of the Entire Suspension Span.
First, a word about the cables them-
selves: the wires, individually and un-
galvanized averaged a diameter of 0.193
inches: galvanized against salt-air cor-
rosion they averaged 0.196 inches. Spec-
ifications as to physical properties re-
quired that the wires have a tensile
strength of 220,000 pounds per square
inch and sufficient
ductility to enable th?
wire to be coiled
around a 5/16 inch
rod without any indi-
cation of fracture. The
cables, after assem-
bling will have a di-
ameter of 28% inches,
and will consist of 17,-
464 wires made into
37 strands of 472
wires each.
Before any actual
spinning of the main
cables could occur it
was necessary to string
a pair of cat-walks be-
tween the cable towers,

tion of the bay, allow-

late the spinning ma-

tween the parallel cat-walks was
obtained by cross walks set about
500 feet apart.
The construction of the cat-walks
was started by pulling a one-inch
"pilot" cable over the towers with
the aid of power winches and tug-
boats. The "pilot" cable, in turn,
drags a heavy 2*4 inch cable into
position: four of these being used
for each cat-walk. The floor of the
walks are composed of strong wire
mesh; thus eliminating fire hazards
and swaying caused by wind resist-
ance. The walks are assembled on
the ground in 100-foot units and
then raised to the four supporting
cables. Heavy oak crosstimbers are
clamped to the mech and cables at
distances of ten feet; from the ends
of these crossbeams are fastened the
vertical posts to which are clamped
the ^-inch cable hand-rail. Inasmuch
as the screen flooring had a rather large
mesh, it was somewhat unsafe for walk-
ing, and would not stop the descent of
bolts, nuts, and smaller tools. There-
fore, a finer mesh flooring was super-
posed upon the original flooring and an
effective curbing of about one foot
achieved at the edges. When the cat-
walk itself was completed, gallows'
frames (name taken from earlier non-
technical function) were placed every
200 feet along the walk; these were
to support the hauling ropes that
would carry the cable-spinning
wheels. When these frames were put
in place and strongly braced by lat-
eral stays the spinning of the main
cables could begin.
The spinning of the cables is par-
adoxically not a spinning operation
at all; to twist or weave the wires
would prevent the separate wires
from sharing the strain equally; also
friction between twisted wires is
greater than between parallel strands
and the former circumstance pre-
vents any accurate predetermination
of each wire's ultimate load. Any
lack of knowledge on the final loads
to be carried by the individual mem-
bers of the bridge was to be avoided
in such a large structure with a 900-
foot unloaded cable length; follow-
ing this idea, the designers had
passed over several alternate meth-
ods of bridging the Bay.

age, there are eye-bars embedded in
the concrete base; to these are con-
nected the strand shoes which actual-
ly hold the ends of the cable wires. The
wire from the ends of the strand shoe is
looped over the spinning wheel and con-
nected to the supply reel which contains,
when full, some sixty miles of the pen-
cil-thick wire. Each wheel has two
grooves in it and carries two loops of
wire from two different reels on each
trip between the supporting towars; the
wheel itself is suspended on a frame
hung from an endless hauling rope that
reaches from shore anchorage to bay
anchorage and back again. Wheels start
from each end of the bridge simulta-
neously and travel with the same speed,
thus allowing each wire to become
equally strained and to lie in symmet-
rical positions. This method is applied
to both main cables at the same time;
the work going on at about six or seven
miles per hour, laying four wires per
wheel at the completion of a round trip.
As previously intimated, the equal
distribution of tension is of primary im-
portance to a bridge of such weight

at the shore anchorage; in laying the
cable wires, this equalization was ac-
complished by comparing the sag of
each individual wire with a "guide"
wire (one for each main cable) which
had been previously adjusted with infi-
nite care and with the use of extremely
precise instruments. As the wires are
placed into approximate position by the
wheel they are adjusted automatically
to conform to the predetermined loaded
parabola of the guide wire by simply
matching sags. In no instance is the
cable, while in the process of formation,
allowed to hang free above the cat-
walks: workmen are all along the line
to keep it in perfect alignment, using a
system of wooden combs or stalls which
are open at the top and which separate
the entire cable into its 37 strands.
Wires are never cut: when one of the
sixty mile reels run out the machinery
for spinning is shut off and the new wire
is carefully spliced in.
When the spinning was first started,
the moving wheel could only be stopped
by signaling the operator on shore
through a relay sent the entire length
of the bridge; now, to eliminate the
escape of the springy wire from the
grooves of the wheel, electric switches
have been installed on the cat-walks
every 250 feet, these stop the machin-
ery instantly.
After the 17,464 wires composing the
cable have been laid and raised into the
position of the office-calculated dead
load parabola, the compaction of the
cable is begun. This is accomplished by
the use of a tremendous compacting
machine which travels the entire length
of the cable; this machine is composed
of six jacks driven by air motors and
capable of supplying 75 tons each, rad-
ically to the cable, this force being more
than sufficient to change the hexagonal
shape of the newly laid cable to its final
roundness. It is then held in "round"
by wire wrappings placed every three
feet pending the application of cable
bands and the final wire wrapping. The
cable bands, weighing between 2000
and 3200 pounds, are next applied to
the cable and from these bands are
hung the suspending cables which will
support the bridge decks. Before the
full dead load is applied to the main
cables, a heavy coat of red led is ap-
plied, then, the full force of the dead
load is put on the cables and is radially
wrapped with a wire armor. These two
items tend to stretch the cable tight,
and further squeeze it, forcing the red
lead into all voids between the wires
and effectively sealing them against the
inroads of rain and the salt air. The
wrapping of the wire armor will be
achieved by a newly designed machine
called the Robinson; it accomplishes a
tight wrap by pushing the preceding
spirals of wire against each other as it
spins the cover. After wrapping, the
cable will be given four coats of weather
resistant paint and the cables will have
spun their little story, a story which
ends in the removal of the cat-walks
just previous to publicly opening the
bridge.

The new Hammond Safety plane,
built in Ypsilanti, is largely a product
of Michigan men. Already 15 of these
super safe planes have been ordered by
the Department of Commerce.
The Hammond is easy to fly and can
be flown by the simplest of the John K.
Publics. It can be landed merely by
pulling the stick all the way back at
200 ft.—a maneuver invariably fatal in
conventional craft. Wh;n desired it can
even land by itself, hands off, with no
more of a bump than one gets with a
parachute. Take-off? Just open the
throttle and light a cigarette. The di-
rectionally stable landing gear holds the
ship on a straight course without the
use of the rudder, in fact research is
under way to remove the rudder alto-
gether.

LARS THOMASSEN
Professor of Chemical Engineering
Among the visitors who go through
the manufacturing divisions at a large
electric concern in Europe there will be
some industrial spies whose job it is to
furnish information on the intricate ma-
chinery and processes shown them.
Some try to take pictures with concealed
cameras, operating the shutter by such
innocent movements as bending over,
or hitching up the pants. However, they
usually find, on developing their pic-
tures that the films are jet black. Why?
After an inspection trip, suspected vis-
itors are shown into a little office, and
during a few parting jokes, a powerful
x-ray beam from a concealed machine
hits the unsuspecting visitor, destroying
his pictures.
This example shows one of the many
uses that the x-rays are put to since W.
C. Rontgen forty years ago discovered
these rays. The use indicated above
shows three of the characteristic prop-
erties of the rays: They are invisible,
penetrate opaque materials, and black-
en photographic films. Rontgen in his
first experiments observed these proper-
ties, and besides noticed that different
materials absorb the rays in different
degrees. On the basis of this it is pos-
sible to obtain a shadow picture, most
frequently called a radiograph, of
opaque matter. The method is very
simple. The object to be photographed,
for instance a piece of a weld, is placed
between the x-ray tube and the film and
near to the latter as possible. The film
is exposed and developed and may show
poor penetration, slag inclusions and gas
inclusions, either alone or combined.
In this way it is possible to "see" in-
side a non-transparent object, while for
visual inspection it would have to be
cut up or otherwise destroyed. No
wonder, then, that the comparatively
cheap and efficient x-ray method has
become an important tool for all kinds
of inspection work in industry. In mod-
ern technique there is a trend to find
materials that are cheap and at the
same time strong. If cheaper materials
and light sections are to be used, faults
in the material can not be tolerated.
That means that the inspection becomes
very important and one of the tools of
an inspection department is the x-rays.
But, you might say, we can not afford
to take x-ray pictures on every casting
and every weld leaving our shop. No,
usually not, but since in modern mass
production, a casting or a weld may be
reproduced from anywhere up to many
thousand times it might pay to make a
few pilot castings, or a few test welds
to find out the cheapest and most con-
venient method of fabrication with the
least possibility of defects. As examples
of this, it may be mentioned that Amer-
ican Manganese Steel Company, one of
the important alloy steel foundries uses
x-rays for inspecting such pilot castings,
and even goes so far as to make castings
in reduced scale when the actual cast-
ing would be too large to be radio-
graphed. In the Ford plant, automatic
welding machines have been adjusted
until they work properly by means of
extensive radiographic work. In some
plants it is customary to radiograph a
certain percentage of the goods manu-
factured so as to control the uniformity
of the product.
In the case of important structures
hundred percent inspection is specified.
Examples of this are the penstocks for
the Boulder Dam where thousands of
feet of weld have been examined, and
steel valve castings for power plants.
Also, in 1931, the American Society of
Mechanical Engineers authorized weld-
ing to be used in boiler construction
provided radiographs were made of all
welded sections of thickness less than 3
inches. This authorization has brought
about a great increase in the use of x-
rays for inspection.
The above applications are perhaps
the most common ones in modern tech-
nique but there are numerous other
problems that may be solved by x-rays.
For instance, airplane propellers may be
inspected for defects, radio tubes for

proper alignment, falsification of paint-
ings of old masters may be detected, di-
mensions and location of reinforcements
of concrete walls may be found, and
many problems that formerly were im-
possible to solve can now be successfully
attacked by the x-rays.
In 1912, von Laue and his two lab-
oratory assistants discovered that crys-
talline matter acts as a diffraction
grating for x-rays. Optical diffraction
gratings are obtained by ruling a num-
ber of fine lines on a glass or a metal
plate. By being placed in a beam of
light it resolves the lights into its com-
ponents, and from a suitable source we
may get a line spectrum. If we know
the distance between the lines on the
grating, we may find the wave length of
the spectral lines. In crystals, we are
provided with a natural grating in
which the atoms themselves form a
three-dimensional grating. By using
crystals we can in this way analyze the
x-ray spectrum. Conversely, if we make
a reasonable assumption about the wave
length of the x-rays, we are able to find
the distances between the atoms in our
grating, which are of the order of 1/4 x
10 " cm or about 1/100,000,000 in. Be-
sides, the spectrum may be interpreted
and furnish information as to how the
atoms are arranged in space.
When we consider that almost all
solid objects in our physical world are
crystalline, we can see what a powerful
tool has been furnished us for the in-
vestigation of matter. As an example,
showing the importance of the arrange-
ment of atoms in space, give a chemist
a sample of diamond and a sample of
graphite. By chemical analysis he is
not able to tell you the difference be-
tween the sparkling transparent, ex-
tremely hard diamond, and the black
flaky, extremely soft graphite. The x-
rays will show that the atoms in the
two cases are arranged in a different
pattern. This is the primary reason for
A Specimen of a Good Weld.
the difference in properties.
A great number of investigations on
the structure of organic and inorganic
materials have made possible a much
better understanding of their properties
as influenced by the arrangement of the
atoms of which they are built. The sci-
ence which uses x-rays in this manner
may be called x-ray crystallography. It
furnishes information to physics, chem-
istry, mineralogy, botany, physiology
and many other sciences.
It may be objected that this is sci-
ence, this is physics, crystallography.
The answer is that there are such short
steps today between pure science, ap-
plied science and engineering. A purely
scientific paper is published, and the
next day, so to speak, the technical re-
search laboratories are applying the
methods or processes given in the paper
to solve their own problems, and often
the methods may find their way out to
the routine testing laboratory. This is
what is happening to the x-ray diffrac-
tion methods, and in the last ten years
it has come to be that many metallo-
graphic investigations can not be said to
be complete unless the problem has been
attacked by x-rays. Recently, it has
been suggested that the
diffraction method be
given a position on a
par with the metallo-
graphic microscope in
routine inspection, main-
ly on account of the ac-
curate determinations of
atomic spacings which
can be made by x-rays.
Besides, metallurgical
engineering, numerous
problems in chemical
engineering can also
be solved by x-rays.

you some, the petrographer with his
microscope some, but the x-rays prob-
ably will help you the most when you
want to find out at what temperature
the formation begins, how large the
crystals are, etc.
Why is it that some organic materials
will stretch elastically? The answer to
that was found in the beginning of the
1920's, in the fact that in these mate-
rials the rows of molecules are, so to
speak, coiled up. When they stretch,
the individual coils separate like a coil
spring. This is for instance the case
with rubber. A lot of work is being
carried out of this kind by the compa-
nies interested in fiber structures, and
also upon the allied problem in rayon
and similar products.
While the above considerations main-
ly have applied to chemical and metal-
lurgical engineering it must be kept in
mind that this branch of engineering fur-
nishes most of the raw materials to the
other engineering divisions, and any
improvement in chemical and metallur-
gical engineering will benefit all engi-
neering branches.

Robert L. Taylor
EDITOR
Technical jour-
nalism has a tal-
ented follower in
the person of Bob
Talyor, former
editor of the
Technic. Bob
recently wrote an
article for Chem-
ical and Metal-
lurgical Engineer-
ing on "How Soy
Beans Help Build
Fords." The article received such great
commendation from all quarters that
the editor of that magazine when in Ann
Arbor, interviewed Bob, and the result
—a position for Bob on the Editorial
Board of that McGraw-Hill Co. publi-
cation.
Triangles and Vulcans claimed him
as a member, and his presence was also
soon noticed on the Engineering Coun-
cil. Taylor was most instrumental in
bringing to Ann Arbor Walter S. Knud-
sen, to address the Engineering Smoker.
This year's smooth running Slide-Rule
Dance is a recent example of Bob's
method of managing things, for he acted
in the capacity of chairman for this af-
fair. Bob devoted many long hours for
the benefit of the Technic and in his
enthusiasm mastered the intricacies of
technical journalism to a remarkable
extent. The effect of his work is more
than startling from a standpoint of both
journalistic and financial improvement.
The former editor has already had a
taste of the world, having performed
odds and ends of summer jobs and gain-
ing valuable experience. He delights
particularly in telling of the job he had
with Sharpies' Solvents last summer—
especially about his work on the para-
tertiaryamylphenol still.
Outdoor life is one of his weaknesses,
as is music, the sweet sound of Bob's
clarinet bolstered the band during his
freshman and sophomore years. At pres-
ent he is spending a great deal of time
keeping his Tri-Delt affiliation intact.
Bob possesses those characteristics
which spell success, and we feel certain
that when he displays the initiative and
logic in his new work that he has at
Michigan, he will conquer proportion-
ally greater fields.

Initiated into the United States from
Sweden at the age of two, Tor J. Xor-
densen, now a tall, handsome blond and
a most likeable personality, is about to
weigh anchor at his faithful Alma Ma-
ter and embark from the calm of uni-
versity life into the turbulent sea of
business and industry.
Five years ago in Auburn, New York,
he proudly displayed a hard-earned high
school diploma and talked of becoming
a college man. After a year's graduate
work at high school, Tor chose to plant
his interests in civil engineering with
the University of Michigan as his source
of knowledge.
Evidence of his fine reputation is
shown by his election as honor council
representative in both his freshman and
sophomore years. In recognition of his
influence with
campus activities
h; gained mem-
bership in Trian-
gles and Vulcans
during his junior
and senior years
respectively. Also,
in his senior year,
election to Tau
Beta Pi signifies
still further Tor's
capabilities as an
excellent student and a true Michigan
man. Since his junior year, Xordensen
has been a staunch A.S.C.E. member;
and, in addition to his presidency of
Theta Xi Fraternity, he has been chos-
en to carry the responsibility of the
chairmanship of this year's Senior Ball.
His favorite pastime lies in the field
of sports: no one sport in particular,
although he is inclined to be partial
toward swimming. He is an all round
man who derives much delight in de-
fending Theta Xi's name in the pool or
on the court.
Tor has had affiliations with the In-
ternational Harvester Company and
spent a very worthwhile, enjoyable sum-
mer at Camp Davis in 1934. He is
mighty anxious to test his abilities on
some large engineering project follow-
ing the completion of his college edu-
cation, and he hopes to be a truly wor-
thy asset to the reputation of Univer-
sity of Michigan engineers.

EXECUTIVE
When the class of '36E leaves tli2
familiar haunts of West Engineering
building, the name of Xoble Ashley, Jr.
will be among those remembered. Com-
ing from a preparatory school in West
Virginia, Ashley entered the University
of Michigan in 1932. Having an inter-
est in editorial work, he tried out for
the Technic and in his sophomore year
became Assistant Publication Manager.
In his junior year he was appointed
Publication Manager and in this capac-
ity did such a fine piece of work that
he was given the position of Managing
Editor in his senior year.
"Ash" combines the admirable qual-
ities of wisdom and whim, amusing his
friends continually with his clever man-
nerisms and gentle satire. He earned
the respect of all Technic staff mem-
bers by his willingness to help everyone
through their difficulties, offering prac-
tical advice and in addition, succeeded
in having all his editorial staff meet all
deadlines.
Besides his good work as editor, Ash-
ley has done well in other activities. As
a student in Highway Engineering he
joined the Transportation Club and has
been Vice-President of that organization
for the last two years. He had charge
of the Transportation exhibit at last
year's Open House and was also a mem-
ber of the Open House committee. The
success of this affair was ample evidence
of Ashley's ability along these lines. He
also demonstrated his executive ability
by negotiations while in charge of or-
chestra arrangements for this year's
Slide Rule Dance.
Vulcans, senior honorary society, in
recognition of his outstanding accom-
plishments, elected him into that organ-
ization.
Although grad-
uating this June,
Ashley is plan-
ning to return
this fall and spec-
ialize in Railroad
Engineering. We
will therefore be
fortunate in hav-
ing him back with
Noble Ashley us again next fall.

LONGER PROGRAMS
"There is a lot of knowledge in col-
leges," Dr. A. Laurence Lowell once re-
marked, "for the incoming students
bring in so much, and the graduating
students take away so little." And yet,
how applicable is this simple statement
to engineering colleges! In the contin-
uous cycle of cramming and overwork,
the engineering college graduate can
hardly be expected to assimilate even
the fundamentals of his courses, let
alone understand completely the theory
involved. Where such conditions exist,
it is obvious that they must be remedied
by the introduction of a longer engi-
neering course leading to a degree or by
other effective means.
Statistics compiled by engineering
faculty committees show that about 43 r;&lt;
of an incoming class ''flunk out." In
a longer course this weeding out could
be more effective. Then again it is quite
possible that a great share of these
"failures" could be trained as techni-
cians to carry on routine engineering
work. Since 1840 degrees have been
conferred on men for the completion of
a four-year curriculum and yet four
years is still the time required to receive
a degree. Doesn't it seem absurd that
with all the development that has taken
place in theories and practices in this
long period no more time is required to
teach engineers now than around the
Civil War? Teaching methods have
changed greatly, of course, but man's
capacity to learn is not far different.
Just what could be taught during this
period is a matter of considerable con-
troversy, but, from a student's point of
view, even if no more cultural subjects
were included, he might at least find
outside culture himself when carrying
an easier schedule.
PIPE COURSES
"An engineer is a fellow whi can tell
whether a thing will work before it is
tried—any poor fool can tell after!"
This definition of an engineer was re-
cently given by Mr. A. M. MacCutcheon.
nominee for the presidency of A.I.E.E.
The question immediately arises, "How
do they get that way?" and the answer
is "Through a thorough knowledge of
the fundamentals."
In many of the so-called "pipe
courses" we find the most fundamental
principles and get the best drill in han-
dling them. The truth of the equation
2V = 0 is so obvious that we are likely
to overlook its importance. But, that
is the way with these fundamentals—
they are obvious and simple, yet their
applications are frequently a bit
"tricky," and lest we get plenty of prac-
tice now while there is ample opportun-
ity we may be embarrassed on the job.
The engineer must be able to visualize
forces, pressure, temperature, moments,
couples and friction all at the same
time. That's how he can tell whether
a thing will work before it is tried. So
let's not make too light of these "pipe
courses" or we may find that we too
are in the class with these "poor fools"
who wait 'til after a thing is tried be-
fore they are sure that it works.
HOW DOES IT PAY?
"Get the MICHIGAN TECIINIC, Amer-
ica's best Engineering College magazine,
just off the press, carrying twenty-four
pages of features at only fifteen cents."
Thus do TECHNIC salesmen hail the
passing students on sales days, attempt-
ing to sell for ISc a magazine that ac-
tually costs more than 22c to publish.
"How," you ask, "can a magazine exist
under those conditions?" Probably ev-
ery magazine in the country, save Read-
er's Digest, depends on its advertising
to establish a low-priced product, and
the TECHNIC is no exception. Sales and
advertising provide our revenue for pub-
lishing the magazine and establishing
a working capital. Without advertising
the TECHNIC unquestionably could not
exist. And so we say, patronize our ad-
vertisers, it is really they who make
your TECHNIC possible!
WHITHER NOW, BOYS?
When you apply for a job and are
granted an interview, you will probably
be asked what, in particular, interests
you—precisely what kind of work you
like best. Many employers will ask you
to state the branch of the engineering
profession you would most like to fol-
low. They are seeking to find whether
you want to do research, design, con-
sulting, operation, or construction work.
It appears that the engineering pro-
fession can be broken down into com-
ponents in two ways. Classification
may be along departmental or special-
ization lines, such as: civil, mechanical,
marine, aero, chemical, electrical, etc.;
or, it may be of a more fundamental
sort, along lines of interest and voca-
tion.
In your second year you have to de-
cide in which department you shall
study, but, unfortunately the necessity
of deciding the field of endeavor you
shall follow is not met until you are in
the latter part of your senior year. To
help you determine exactly what you
want to do in your chosen department
of engineering the TECHNIC, starting
next fall, is going to publish a series of
articles covering the major types of
work open to the engineer. In these
articles we shall try to show what the
engineer in each of these fields does;
what possibilities there are in each field;
what personal qualifications are re-
quired; and, in general, help you decide
whether you want to be a research en-
gineer or designer, a consulting engi-
neer, or an operator, or a supervisor of
construction work.

TELEPHONE engineers had to find a way to stop gray squirrels gnawing holes in
the lead sheath of telephone cables. Even a tiny hole may let in moisture—short
circuit the wires—and put a number of telephones out of service temporarily. C. Many
ideas were tried, but the squirrels gnawed on. Finally the cables were painted with
black asphaltum and sprinkled with sand. The gnawing stopped, fl. Not a major

Echoes under the arch have it that
several new books authored by mem-
bers of our faculty will be published in
the near future. Professor T. E. Ems-
wiler is revising a book on thermo-dy-
namics and has recently written an
article on heat losses through windows.
Professors Lay and Good are complet-
ing their work on a volume on internal
combustion engines. Professors R. A.
Dodge and M. T. Thompson expect to
have a new book on fluid mechanics
ready by next fall. The text will at-
tempt to use as little mathematics as is
deemed expedient; and it will not go
beyond advanced calculus, containing,
however, all advancements made in that
field up to date.
Over in the Chemical Engineering de-
partment, Professor A. E. White is more
cheerful than ever: reason for multitud-
inous smiles being the pleasant increases
in industries' call for chemical engineers.
It seems that back in December, 19
different firms asked for men and that
since then requests have been coming in
with delicious regularity. Some cynics
are saying that the newly apparent fer-
vor amongst our embryo Chemicals can
be traced to these signs of industrial
awakening; others, still more sceptical,
are inclined to believe that the spurt has
its origin in the awful propinquity of
our semi-annual 'blues' session.
Research work, both private and in-
dustrial, is going on at near-capacity:
work being done on items from kero-
sene stoves to historical studies of air-
current phenomenon,—Professor H. C.
Adams of the Department of Naval
Architecture hoping to prove a paradox-
ical theorem on the rolling of ships by
the use of apparatus which has been the
product of several years research work.
Our own colleagues are showing ad-
mirable research abilities in their pro-
longed efforts to identify themselves in
the numerous snaps taken at the Slide-
Rule Dance. On commenting on the
assiduousness of the engineers, Bob
Gash murmured beautificially: "Ah, the
patience of ego."
The Technic is a little proud also
(but with true journalistic dignity).
Without any action on our part we have
established relations with two foreign
technical papers, a French chemical
magazine and the official organ of Col-
lege of Engineering, University of Ven-
ezuela. We're still looking for some
technical linguists to identify some
French salts.
And in sad conclusion, will someone
shed a tear for those unwary engineers
who wandered over into the Literary
College to borrow pencils (or how would
Freud put it?) and wound up trying to
solve Willy Wordsworth with panting
slide-rules.

• The modern milk can is better because
it's welded. \&amp; hether the can is made of
aluminum or stainless steel—from the
standpoints of cleanliness, sturdiness and
serviceability—it is easy to see why the
use of welded joints is beneficial.
Welding has made many good products
better—milk cans,automobiles,airplanes,
radios, refrigerators, streamlined trains
and a thousand other things. This modern
method of manufacture is applicable to
the widest range of materials steel and
iron, aluminum, copper, brass and all
other alloys and metals, even platinum.
It is ideal for use where strong, smooth,
invisible joints are necessary for enamel-
ing, for cleanliness or for appearance.
Tomorrow's engineers will be expected
to know how to apply this modern metal-
working process. Several valuable and in-
teresting technical booklets describing

ess of welding and cutting in design,

Round Bottom Floats Giving a Lower Center of Gravity and Better Draining Properties
are Features of This New Dry Dock.
Notes Of The Profession
SOMETHING NEW IN DRY DOCKS
A new 15,000 ton floating drydock
that incorporates several distinctive new
features of drydock design, has been
placed in service in Seattle. The dock
is comprised of five separate sections,
each of which is 90 feet in length and
127 feet in width. The sections are
rectangular pontoons with round bot-
toms, differing from the usual flat keels
in that respect. The first and fifth sec-
tions are provided with aprons which
overhang some 36 feet from the struc-
ture proper, giving an over-all length
of 530 feet.
Previous to its construction, the erect-
ing company went through an exhaus-
tive study of drydock types and mate-
rials, finally selecting western fir as the
most satisfactory and economical mate-
rial for their particular design. The
feature in using round bottoms instead
of the conventional flat keel is that all
the water inside the pontoons can be
removed; whereas, in the flat-bottomed
type, residual waters of some 18 to 22
inches always remained. This ability to
completely empty the pontoons in-
creased the lifting potentialities of the
dock considerably. Precautions have
been taken against marine wood borers
prevalent in the waters of Puget Sound:
water from the pontoons: and secondly,
by making the necessary ballast of con-
crete; this, entirely protects the interior
lumber and does away with any pockets
that might prevent the water from
draining to the pump orifices. The
rounded bottom lowers the center of
gravity giving greater stability than or-
dinarily achieved in structures of that
type; also, the floating effect of the pon-
toons is concentrated directly under the
hull of the ship lifted. Each section has
installed in it two electrically driven,
centrifugal pumps, one at each side, cap-
able of lifting a large ship in less than
one hour—thus, it is seen that the dock
not only possesses an unusually high
safety factor, but its functional speed
is very high.
BIG PUMPINCS IN SAN FRANCISCO
BAY
The San Francisco-Oakland Bay-
Bridge is big—five miles long and con-
taining steel which represents 1% of the
U.S. steel production in 1933; but, lest
we forget, some of the incidental work,
while very important and not so assidu-
ously publicized, is of equal magnitude.

struction of the project, to make a semi-
subaqueous fill several miles long with
a width sufficient to accommodate eight
traffic lanes and the bed for a double
track railroad. This gargantuan task
of shifting the floor of San Francisco
Harbor was accomplished through the
employment of a super-dredge: "The
Marshall C. Harris." The dredge is the
largest suction dredge in the world us-
ing shore power and is the most power-
ful dredge of any type. It has a con-
nected electrical load of over 4000
horsepower in operating equipment; the
power is brought to the dredge through
an armored shore cable at 11,000 volts
and is subsequently stepped down to
2,200 volts, that potential being used
on the majority of the equipment. The
size of the "Marshall C. Harris" makes
it practically a floating industrial plant;

the pump casing alone, to give some
idea of the size, weighs 25,000 pounds
and is cast of a special abrasive resis-
tant alloyed iron. To build up this tre-
mendous fill, the pump was operated at
an average capacity of 900
cubic yards per hour, moti-
vated by 2,500 to 3,000 horse-
power motors, depending on
the length of the pipe line.
The pumps worked at 355
R.P.M., and, at times, it was
dredging and pumping at a
distance of four miles; that
is a long pump for a long
bridge.
BORROW PIT WORK
Modern methods have almost com-
pletely obviated the earlier techniques
in earth-moving. Today, contractors are
using internal combustion motored trac-
tors to haul dirt whenever the slightest
opportunity presents itself.
In the vicinity of Cody, Wyoming, a
job requiring the removal of some 112,-
000 cubic yards of earth on a stretch
1.2 miles long was done entirely by
tractors: 12 yard scrapers making a
3000 foot trip in 11 minutes.
Another instance of rapid and effi-
cient hauling was shown in the construc-
tion of the six Santa Clara dams in
California. A situation developed in the
Santa Clara Valley when a shortage of
water occurred that threatened the de-
struction of the valley's fertility. The
valley is worked by irrigation, the water
being supplied by pumping from verti-
cal wells. Low rainfall in recent years
had made it necessary to dig deeper
and deeper in order to obtain the requi-
site water for cultivation. Finally, a
water conservation area was set aside
to take care of future drought eventual-
ities: six dams were to be built; their
function being that of storing water and
allowing it to seep naturally into the
ground. Thus, the dams were different
from the usual irrigation dams; they
were not meant to supply surface water
—the water merely seeps through to the
impervious underground strata and flow
along to the pumps where it is subse-
quently brought to the surface; in a
word, the dams will function in raising
the level of the water-table of the area.
The work was done entirely by trac-
tor; speed was expedient as the winter
rains were needed for the next summer's
crop. Fortunately, the material encoun-
tered on the project was almost all
earthy in character. At the Stevens
Creek Dam work went ahead at top-
speed: the yardage moved averaging
79 cubic yards per hour—that's certain-
ly working the borrow-pit ragged.

EUROPEAN ARC BREAKERS
Since the advent in 1928 of Dr. Sle-
pian's De-ion principle in its relation-
ship to arc-interruption theory, arc-
breaking research in Europe has been
going on at top speed. At present there
are four common types of circuit break-
ers employed: the expansion circuit-
breaker, frequently employing water as
the extinguishing agent; the compressed
air method which operates by blowing
compressed air through the arc, either
parallel to, or perpendicular to the lon-
gitudinal axis of the arc. Another, is
oil-poor type; in these cases the pres-
sure of escaping oil vapor coming
through restricted orifices extinguishes
the arc. Lastly there is the familiar oil
circuit breaker which paradoxically but
efficiently extinguishes the fire of the
arc with oil.

SIGMA RHO TAU GETS NATIONAL
RECOGNITION
The alumnus and faculty of every en-
gineering college perennially laments
the dearth of speaking ability among
technically trained men. The situation
has usually been remedied (however,
the methods have only been partially
effective) by the inclusion of speech
courses in the regular engineering cur-
riculum; here, at Michigan, we have
seen the origin of the movement to train
and practice engineers in speech while
they are still students. The organiza-
tion promoting the cultivation of good
public speaking is known as Sigma Rho
Tau—Alpha chapter having been organ-
ized here in 1926 by four students under
the direction of Prof. R. D. Brackett.
At present Prof. F. N. Menefee is Na-
tional President of the Society.
Training begins by having the pros-
pective members meet in small groups—
known in the parlance of the society as
neophytes. These groups meet weekly
and each member is given the oppor-
tunity to speak at every meeting. At
the end of the first semester of this pre-
liminary training, ranks may be raised
to novice by invitation and subsequent
to a speech made on the stump coevally
with the planting of the time-honored
tung-oil seed. Before any further rise
in rank can be achieved, activity must
be taken along the line of official duties
in the organization or in the various
speech activities—this makes one an as-
sociate member. Activities in several
more projects can make one eligible for
full membership and permission to wear
the key of the Sigma Rho Tau, the na-
tional honorary speech society.
At present there are five chapters
with several more being organized on
western campuses, things shaping up
toward final formation at the University
of Nebraska.
The Society has evolved a new meth-
od of debate, the process being one of
mutual cross-examination. Sigma Rho
Tau has also earned the respect of the
far-side of the campus by defeating
Adelphi, the speech society of our col-
leagues in the Literary College. Further
prominence has been given the organi-
zation by its recognition by the Ameri-
24
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Bracket!, the National Director, has re-
ceived innumerable letters commending
the social good performed by the prac-
tice debates in acquainting engineers
with public affairs and in instilling in
the students more interest in our eco-
nomic society.
It is easily seen that the organization
not only provides intrinsic enjoyment
to its members, but also gives the mem-
bers invaluable experiences in expound-
ing technical problems to varied audi-
ences. Truly, the Societies' motto of
"Learn to speak by speaking" has been
very effective.
ALUMNI
VICE-PRESIDENT
Starting conservatively after a very
successful four years on campus, Lyon
Frank Terry spent the first few months
after his graduation working for the
University — in the Buildings and
Grounds Department. Soon however,
he was off to conquer bigger worlds in
the oil and gas district of Oklahoma and
Kansas. Mr. Terry quickly rose to the
top in this game and was soon directing
the construction of several long distance
pipe lines in Oklahoma and Tennessee;
one of them being a 270-mile line from
Louisiana across the Mississippi River
into Memphis. This job was one of the
first of many successful ones that he has
completed while being affiliated with the
organization of Ralph E. Davis, Con-
sulting Engineer of New York and Pitts-
burgh. At present Mr. Terry holds the
position of vice-president of this com-
pany and is in charge of their New
York office.
Save for serving in the World War
as a lieutenant in the 58th Field Artil-
lery, Mr. Terry has spent his whole life
in the oil and gas field and has recently
climaxed this work by completing a nat-
ural gas line which is bringing natural
gas into Vienna, Austria.
This last job is a splendid goal for
any Engineer to reach, but we venture
to say that Mr. Terry will not stop here
but will rise to still greater heights in
the future.

B—The Speed and Spectral Sensi-
tivity of the Film
C—The Speed of the Lens
D—The Subject
If all of the items could be placed in
a formula and designated by the letter
assigned to them, "B" would be a con-
stant if some standard film or plate is
used. "C" is also a constant for any
given stop. Assuming the atmosphere
to be clear, then "d" is a constant. We
will analyze items "a," "b," and "c."
From the time of the year, the hour
of the day and the location of the place
the declination, hour angle and latitude
are determined. With this data the
spherical triangle can be solved for the
sun's altitude and, taking into account
refraction, the altitude of the sun so
obtained can be correlated with light
intensity. The correct exposure for any
particular subject may be determined
from this correlation. If the sky is not
clear the photographer must apply a
light intensity factor. Exposure tables
and calculators give average values for
average conditions, but the use of these
devices is subject to the photographer's
ability to judge existing conditions and
connect them with figures in the table
or in the calculator. There are a num-
ber of types of exposure meters, but the
most satisfactory are the present pho-
tronic exposure meter and the B. &amp; H.
photometer. Shutter speeds can be
checked from photographs of the alter-
nations of an AC current in a neon bulb.
Photography is, then, a science. In
so far as the actual taking of pictures
is concerned exposure is the important
factor to be considered. Time, place,
atmospheric conditions, and the nature
of the lens and film, determine the cor-
rect exposure. A scientific treatment of
these factors will result in good nega-
tives that are not just "luck."

GEODETICS &amp; CHESS
By the way of Michigan City, Indi-
ana, Central High School in Detroit and
our own College of Engineering, the
world received a capable and industrious
civil engineer in the person of Harry
Bouchard, '11c, Associate Professor of
Geodesy and Surveying. Bouchard has
always been an insatiable wanderer: im-
mediately after graduation he went
s:;uth and spent several years in that
territory working on hydroelectric and
railroad construction projects. In 1918
he became Assistant Professor of Geo-
desy and Surveying at this University,
Professor Harry Bouchard

1925 when he again became desirous of
investigating the other side of the hori-
zon. This time he accepted a Profes-
sorship in Engineering at Pei Yang
University in China. Professor Bou-
chard taught here for three years before
he again felt occasioned to visit differ-
ent lands; this, he accomplished by a
leisurely tour through eastern Asia and
Europe, arriving in Ann Arbor in 1928
and rejoining the faculty in his previous
capacity, receiving, the following year
his present position of Assistant Profes-
sor. Constantly in touch with needs in
his particular department, Professor
Bouchard wrote and published a worthy
and comprehensive book on surveying.
Writing texts and teaching students new
techniques in transit-tossing not being
sufficient to keep the Professor busy, he
works with the American Society of
Civil Engineers, of which he is a mem-
ber, in regards to triangulation work,
is a member of the Michigan Engineer-
ing Society, Tau Beta Pi, Sigma Xi, and
Triangle and will play a slick game of

HIGH STEPPER
Coach Hoyt is grooming a promising
young engineer on his track team for
big things in cinder competition. This
speedy and versatile young man is none
other than our own Bob Osgood, up and
coming junior mechanical engineer.
Bob came to us from Lakewood High
School in Cleveland, Ohio in 1933 where
he had been a member of the varsity
track team. During his high school ca-
reer. Bob annexed the state scholastic
record of IS.6 sec. for the high hurdles
along with several honors as a member
of a first place relay team.
Arriving in Ann Arbor in September
of 1933, Bob had no trouble in finding
the rendezvous of the fresh trackmen
and quickly took unto himself a pair of
spikes and subsequently a nice looking
set of frosh numerals. In his sophomore
of the Tri Delt house, but the most of
the time you can find Bob flashing his
ankles or chasing an indicator up and
down a slide rule.
Here's Bob Osgood step-
ping over a high one. just
last week he was seen
jumping around an anvil
in front of the Annex
where he was being ini-
tiated into Vulcans, Sen-
ior Honorary Society.
year Bob made his varsity letter early
in the fall as a fellow who could always
step that high hirdle with more than
the requisite speed and grace. This
year Hoyt has been shifting Osgood
into a new line of track endeavor: Bob
has been running on the relay team;
and with even more success than he had
in flashing over the hurdles. Bob us-
ually runs third in the relay and it is
in this capacity that Osgood went to the
l*enn Relays—a man who can win a
place for himself on Michigan's contin-
gent to these famous relays is certainly
a fancy cinder-smasher.
. In school, Bob has been recognized
by Triangles, who elected him to their
organization this last fall. Socially, Bob
is also at the head of the class, having
been House Manager of his fraternity,
Phi Kappa Tau. Recently they further
showed their appreciation and admira-
tion of Bob as a fellow to get along
with by making him Pledge Manager.
Sometimes Bob heaves a sigh, ominous
of weighty implications, in the direction

Should you ever become seized by an
overpowering curiosity to venture be-
hind the locked door on the third floor
of the Engineering Annex you will be
rewarded by a dusty relic of Michigan's
aeronautic history. Resting complacent-
ly on a rack on this lonely attic floor
lies a monoplane built by the Dayton-
Wright Airplane Company for the Gor-
don-Bennet Race of 1920.
A Michigan graduate, Mr. Arthur
Bowman was the designer of the plane

which had the important feature of re-
tractable landing gear. The gear was
one of the first successful retractable
units ever designed. It was hand oper-
ated; the crank that retracted the wheels
simultaneously operated the variable
camber wing. This mechanism worked
in such a way that the high lift neces-
sary for landing and taking off was ob-
tained when the wheels were down. As
the wheels were cranked up, the leading
and trailing edges would flatten out giv-
ing the wing proper camber for high
speed flight. It was apparent from
these features that the plane was a fore-
runner of the modern airliner.
The General Motors Company had
this plane on exhibit for several years;
when they wished to replace it with
other exhibits the plane was offered to
the University. It was taken here and
displayed for some time, then moved
again to make room for other exhibits.
The last move placed the once modern
plane in the dust of the Annex attic and
inasmuch as the Building and Grounds
Department calculates the cost of fur-
ther moving at forty-three dollars, you
will probably have to content yourself
with an effigy hanging on the wall of
the third floor of the West Engineering
Building.
NEW TELESCOPE FOR TEXANS
The University of Texas will own
and maintain a new astronomical ob-
servatory on the summit of Mount
Locke (6790 feet) in southwestern Tex-
as, the operating staff being provided
by the University of Illinois.
When completed, this telescope will
be the second largest in the world. The
instrument will be housed under a great
dome and it is of the reflecting type,
employing an eighty inch concave mir-
ror which brings the parallel rays of
light received to a focus 27 feet above
the mirror. The rotating dome of the
new observatory weighs 125 tons and
revolves upon 26 trucks similar in size
to railway freight car wheels. In the
construction of the wheels and other
cast parts, special precautions were tak-
en to prevent cracking and to preclude
the existence of internal stresses—the
University is rightfully taking no chances
in the construction details of its new
star gazer.

the Main Dynamo Laboratory.
The Electrical Engineering Department provides a wide variety of training in electrical subject
matter for both electrical and non-electrical engineering students. The laboratories are equipped with
many kinds of apparatus and measuring devices required in order to give adequate opportunity for the
student to familiarize himself with electrical circuits and machinery. The laboratory instruction is
arranged to give each student full opportunity to learn the methods of connecting and operating ap-
paratus, and thereby support the more theoretical type of work given in the lecture room.
The laboratories are divided into eight sections: The Main Laboratory, filled with a.c. and d.c.
motors and generators, rotary converters, dynamometers, stroboscopes and mechanical type oscillo-
graphs, is used by both electrical and non-electrical students; The Illumination Laboratory used for
the study of the sources and distribution of light; The Electronics Laboratory in which many types of
electron activity are investigated. New equipment for the manufacture of electron tubes has just
been added. The Radio and Telephone Laboratory for the study of all kinds of communication prob-
lems; The Standardization Laboratory with its precision apparatus for the calibration of meters and
transformers; The Heat Transfer Laboratory equipped with two Hydrocals; The High Voltage Lab-
oratory with its cathode-ray oscillograph and surge generator for the study of transient phenomena;

"DON'T TALK BACK"
YOU can't argue with an officer. One G-E engineer
learned the truth of this modern proverb when he
was detained by Panama Canal authorities and the
radio tubes he carried were impounded. The
officers were convinced that the unfamiliar objects
were bombs. And when an officer has made up his
mind, that settles it. The tubes were carted away.
Some years ago, I. R. Weir, of the General Electric
Radio Engineering Department, was en route to
Tegucigalpa, capital of Honduras, Central America,
to install a radio transmitter. He carried with him
two of the first large, part-metal radio transmitting
tubes which had been developed by General Electric.
"Upon arriving at the Panama Canal," he relates,
"I was surprised to find that I was detained for in-
vestigation on suspicion of carrying bombs. After
much argument it was decided that I should have
to leave my radio vacuum tubes in the ammunition
dump during my stay in the Canal Zone."
CLEAN DIRT
SOAP and water will still be needed to clean
Junior's face and hands, but if Junior's father is
a florist he will welcome this clean dirt.
Florists and specialty growers wage a never-ending
battle against weeds, insects, and plant parasites
which flourish in greenhouse soil. But reinforcements
have arrived. Clean dirt may now be economically
obtained by means of electric equipment developed
by General Electric scientists.
Electric heating units, arranged in a wooden bin,
heat a quantity of soil to a temperature of 160-180 F.
Heating sterilizes the soil by a process which resem-
bles the pasteurization of milk, and weed seeds,
insects, and fungi which are dormant in the soil are
killed during the sterilization process. In the result-
ing germless dirt, plants can attain a vigorous,
uniform growth, free from the competition of weeds
and the inroads of other plant enemies.
"AH, WATSON, AN INDUSTRIAL CRIME"
THE "corpus delicti"—a broken resistance wire;
the suspect—a defect in the wire; the detective
—a microchemist. With microscope and analytical
apparatus of incredibly small dimensions this
industrial superdetective finds tiny crystals of
sulphate near the break. The trail leads to a nearby
furnace giving off sulphurous fumes. Thus the
wire is cleared of suspicion of having been defective,
and the criminal fumes are eliminated.
This analysis is typical of many industrial "micro-
mysteries' that have been solved in the Research
Laboratory of General Electric. A development
from methods devised in the fields of biology and
medicine, microchemistry has become an indis-
pensable servant to industry, with accomplishments
as great as the quantities with which it deals are
small.
With thimble-sized beakers, and test tubes as small
as 1/50 of an inch in diameter, the microchemist
analyzes quantities of material 17,000 times lighter
than a drop of water. He has defined a new unit
of mass, the gamma, one millionth of a gram. A
streak of dirt, a smudge, a minute pit mark—all
these can be taken into the laboratory with a
reasonable assurance that the microchemist will be
able to provide the answer to the problem.
