Dr. Victor Paschkis, of Columbia University, has de-
veloped a rapid, inexpensive, and highly accurate
method for the solution of heat-transfer problems.
Operation is based on the proved mathematical
similarity of certain thermal and electrical phenom-
ena. The method is accurate because easily made
and recorded electrical measurements are substi-
tuted for difficult and erratic thermal measurements.
When the temperature and thermal characteristic
of substances are known, solutions are quickly ol
tained. But the method is also applicable to sul
stances whose thermal characteristics are unknown
Such diverse problems as heat loss in buildin
materials, determining the time-temperature gradienl
in turbine rotors, or the thermal characteristics &lt;
plastics, are quickly and accurately solved.

... With the tin shortage becoming more
acute every day and the tin content of
solders and bearing alloys being steadily
reduced by WPB, there comes a sugges-
tion that a large part of this situation
can be remedied by salvaging solder
from old car bodies. A conservative esti-
mate places the obtainable solder at one
to ten pounds per car—for older models,
as high as fifty pounds.
. .. One type of gun barrel gage being
used extensively in arms production is
accurate to 1 10,000 inch and can be
operated by a layman after fifteen min-
utes instruction. Requiring only one pass
through the barrel this instrument in-
dicates whether the bore is oversize,
undersize, out-of-round, or bell mouth
and at exactly what point discrepancy
occurs. This same gadget with slightly
different fittings can be used to check
the bore after rifling.
. .. Due to the dwindling supply of high
grade blue chip iron ore of the Lake
Superior region (at present consumption
rates estimates place the average com-
pany's reserves at ten years) greater
utilization is expected of the almost
limitless deposits of an iron-bearing
rock known as taconite. Although the
major constituent of taconite is silica,
a satisfactory thirty per cent yield of
iron can be obtained. Another source of
iron, the low-grade ore deposits of Up-
per Michigan, has recently been found
by a large Detroit firm to give a satis-
factory yield of iron powder when ex-
tracted electrolytically.
... In Middletown, Ohio, what is be-
lieved to be the lowest cost plant ever
built has since June 1 been turning out
war materials. Consisting of three World
War I electric furnaces, an old building
with two overhead cranes, and odds and
ends from virtually every part of the
country, the plant was turning out pro-
peller blade steel less than seven months
after the building contract was signed.
... Dehydration of foodstuffs is not
new, but the recent problem of shipping
space has given greater importance to
the drying process. In a method now
being devoloped by the government, the
flavor, attractiveness, and quality of the
dried food is completely recovered upon
resoaking. After dehydration the food-
stuffs are packed in tins containing ni-
trogen. It is estimated that only one-
eighth of the shipping space previously
required will be needed for the dried
food.
... A large tin container company has
announced the perfection of a new fiber
container. The method of manufacture
requires no new machinery and uses no
tin. Paper is run through the tin mills,
cut to shreds, lithographed, and seamed
on presses formerly used for metal con-
tainers.
... For processes where an atmosphere
of dry, purified hydrogen must be main-
tained with a dew point less than -40° F,
a special two-element electron tube has
been developed which indicates the
slightest contamination of the hydrogen
with oxygen or moisture. Electrons fly-
ing between the hot tungsten filament

To Win A War


Behind the guns—behind the machines and the motors
that drive them — is steam, "prime mover" of all
industry. • Each time we find a way to squeeze an
extra B.T.U. from a pound of coal or a gallon of oil,
industrial output is accelerated and implements of
war rush sooner to waiting hands at the front. Because
B&amp;W engineers have always been the first to origi-
nate major improvements in boilers, Babcock &amp;
Wilcox has become America's largest producer of
steam generating equipment. • Today, all our efforts
are devoted to helping
utilities and industrial
plants produce the pow-
er to win this war. In
the victorious tomorrow,
we shall stand ready to
serve you whose hands
will guide the future of
American industry.

and plate continually bombard the gas
which flows through the tube. If the gas
is pure, all of the electrons reach the
plate and no change in current results.
However, if the gas contains oxygen or
water vapor, some of the electrons are
picked up and form negative ions,
thereby reducing the current.
... Liquid carbon dioxide discharged

between fire and atmosphere. Used in
this way it protects airplane engines

ing action, the cold gas cools the fire
below the ignition point. In combat
planes gasoline tanks are protected
against explosion by filling the empty
space above the fuel with COs. The
navy, in addition to using it for fire-
fighting, employs carbon dioxide to in-
flate life belts and rafts by installing

be, it is suggested that a single-purpose
slide rule be constructed from card-
board or other workable material. Three
fundamental types of rule, single-sliding,
double-sliding, and middle support, can
be used for most equations although
more complicated types are often neces-
sary. The principles involved are sim-
ilar to the common rule, but consider-
able ingenuity is required to put the
equations into usable form.
. .. One of the newest in an almost un-
limited number of uses devised for the
electron microscope is the examination
of the crystalline structure of metallic
surfaces. The surface to be examined is
first polished and etched with acid. It is
then dipped into a solution of plastic
Formvar in dioxane. The solvent is then
allowed to evaporate leaving a plastic
film 1/500,000 inch thick—about equal
to one-tenth the length of yellow-orange
light waves. The film is then stripped
from the metal surface, retaining a mi-
croscopic impression of the hills and
valleys of the metallic crystals. When
viewed with the electron micrscope, the
structure is magnified 20,000 times.
... To test for under-surface flaws in
heat-treated parts, one research labora-
tory devised a method using magnetism.
Symmetrical objects such as bearings
and bearing races when magnetized pro-
duce a uniform field, but any defect
such as a hard or soft spot will change
the permeability and, consequently, the
magnetic field. In testing a part, any
residual magnetism is first completely
removed. The heat-treated piece is then
rotated at high speed and magnetized.
The flux of the rotating object is then
examined with an oscilloscope. Only
variations in the magnetic field induce
a voltage so that defects show up on the
tube screen as dips in an otherwise
straight line. A second reference line
indicates within a few degrees the spot
on the periphery where discrepancy oc-
curs. Modifications of this system give
an audible signal by means of a bell or
buzzer, or operate machinery to eject
the faulty piece from a production line.
'. . . Because the American public has
failed to salvage enough scrap steel to

propriated $600,000 for the purpose of

... Recent public interest in the quality
of our planes as compared to those of the
enemy has drawn comment from every
quarter. One aeronautical engineer who
has examined at first hand a Mitsubishi
Kiusei engine which, though shot down,
was in good condition states that it is a
"highly dependable though not highly
developed engine, probably produced
under time and tooling limitation."
According to the engineer, the designers
combine all of the most desirable fea-
tures of many foreign engines into one
engine that 'had to work the first time'
and apparently did.

... Production of magnesium this year
promises to be many times as great as in

... The Lone Ranger has nothing on the
electrical engineering profession—just as
the famous westerner's horse is shod
with silver so engineers are now replac-
ing copper, tin and other scarce mater-
ials in electrical apparatus with the
precious but relatively available metal.
It is also reported that silver is now
being used extensively in soldering and
brazing. The increasing use of silver not
only relieves the demand for other
metals, but in most cases improve the
performance of the product in which it
is substituted.
... The black sands of Oregon are now
being examined extensively for deposits
of chromite ores. Carried on by the
U. S. Geological Survey, the explorations
are conducted with the aid of a magneto
meter. This device, sensitive to mag-
netite, has indicated deposits of from
5% to 9% chromic oxide about 70 feet
beneath the earth's surface.
... To cut man hours in arms production
and save millions in cost, the Army Ord-
nance Department has shown many con-
tractors how to cut corners. By intro-
ducing a stamped clip instead of a wing
nut assembly, 8.7 carloads of steel were
saved and production hours were re-
duced ISO fold. In another similar case
17,000 pounds of steel and 8,000 man-
hours were saved. An automotive com-
pany substituted a stamped trigger plate
for a forged piece thereby eliminating 29
operations. Enough aluminum to build

supercharger was replaced by a stamped
steel part.

by-product of acetic acid and methanol
(wood alcohol), its production goes

deposits in Texas formerly neglected be-
cause they are too far from supplies of

the large forest of post oak.
... As many as 4200 separate wires are
incased in many telephone cables. If
the slightest amount of moisture should
enter the casing through a pin hole, the
possibilities of short circuits and service
interruptions are very great. The reason
that this seldom happens in all of the
100,000,000 miles of wire in this coun-
try is introduction of dry nitrogen into
the cable under pressure. If a leak de-
velops, the escaping gas keeps the water
out until instruments on the cable de-
tect a drop in pressure.
... An automatic ice warning indicator
which will warn pilots of the presence
of the first microscopically thin film of
ice has been developed. From the lead-
ing edge of the wing there protrudes a
two inch metal disc, over the face of
which a metal "feeler" slowly rotates.
When the first film of ice forms between
the disc and the feeler, an electric con-
tact is broken and a red light flashes in
the cockpit. As the ice builds up and
pushes the feeler away from the disc,
the action registers the ice thickness on
the cockpit instrument. At a given ice
thickness the device will automatically
start the aircraft's de-icing system.
The device, weighing only three
pounds, will be a tremendous relief to
the pilot. It will be more of a relief to
know the de-icing gear will be put into
action automatically. There is no doubt
about the utility of such a device in
avoiding accidents.
. . . Because the supply of Kapok has
been cut off by the war, a company has
been organized to provide a substitute—

and light as Kapok, but when used as
filler for airplane pilot's life preservers,
has six times the heat insulation of nat-
ural wood. Next year, 50,000 acres of
barren land in Northern Michigan will
be planted to the weed. The pods re-
quire a special drying process before
they are usable.

of shot per minute), well armored, and
fast (390 miles per hour, top speed). It
is equal to or better than any fighter in
the world between 16,000-24,000 feet.
Details of construction: air cooled
motor, wing construction built on one
main and one auxiliary spar (which con-
struction reduces weight 300 pounds but
makes repair difficult), no trimming tabs,
no gas tanks in the wings, acutely sloped
windshield with bulletproof glass 2^4
inches thick, and retractable tailwh?el
which is locked in central position when
control stick is pulled far back. In case
the pi'.ot is forced to bale out, a button
releases a cartridge which blows the
cockpit hood clear of the plane. Unde-
sirable features: poor performance at
very high or very low altitudes, aero-
dynamically poor design, short 'range
and low hitting power of some of the
cannon, and high landing speed and
wing loading. Also, the factory in which
most of the Fw 190A3 fighters were
made was last seen just before the RAF
raid on Bremen.

CONTROL
By
D. M. McCUTCHEON, '3IE
A TOUR of industrial plants today
would reveal recent large increases
in the number of X-ray installations.
The penetrating and revealing X-radia-
tion is being widely used for the exam-
ination of metals and other opaque
objects for check on internal soundness.
Applications to highly stressed aircraft
castings and welds in structural and
armored parts probably account for the
greatest interest and application of the
X-ray inspection method.
This article will review the design of
a laboratory for radiographic inspection
in the manufacture of aircraft by a
plant recently converted from a peace
time producer of domestic appliances.
The original plant had a small non-
ferrous foundry which could be used to
produce a portion of the Aluminum al-
loy castings required. The majority of
the castings must be purchased from
outside sources.
The plant management found that
specifications relating to aircraft struc-
tures required X-ray examination of a
large number of the castings used in the
assemblies. As this company had no
X-ray installation or information as to
the requirements for establishing such
a department, outside advice was se-
cured. Estimates were obtained from
several X-ray manufacturers on the cost
of the installation required. Facilities
in the immediate vicinity were investi-
gated with the possibility of sub-con-
tracting the X-ray work to established
testing laboratories. Local conditions
and costs indicated that this plant
would have to set up its own X-ray in-
spection department. A metallurgist,
thoroughly familiar with X-ray testing,
was hired to plan and advise on the
establishment and control of this de-
partment. The figures below are based
upon the government specifications re-
quiring X-ray examination of 10 per
cent of any one lot of castings whose
load strength is less than a certain frac-
tion of the material strength. Castings
subjected to higher stresses are Class I
castings and will require that 25 per
cent of any one lot be submitted for
X-ray inspection. A defective casting
in any one lot will require the X-ray
examination of the entire lot. The fol-
lowing report was made by the metal-
lurgist after investigating the problem.
I. General survey of casting volume.
A survey of the number of castings
requiring production X-ray examination
and the factors which will affect this
estimate are as follows:
The total number of castings to be
X-rayed per day based upon the mini-
mum requirements are 3200 castings.
The experience of an established X-ray
laboratory on a similar project indicates
that approximately 20 per cent must be
added to the minimum requirements in
allowing for 100 per cent X-raying of
those lots found to have rejected cast-
ings. The proposed laboratory must
then be capable of X-raying 3840 cast-
ings per day. This volume of castings
can only be handled by using a produc-
tion type of X-ray unit for the econom-
ical processing. This will be discussed
later.
II. X-ray examination jor foundry
control.
The plant foundry is scheduled to
make 50 of the total of 300 different de-
signs required in the construction of the
assemblies. A small X-ray laboratory is
required for development work near the
foundry to establish the best foundry
practice. This unit is to be set up sep-
arate from the production X-ray unit in
order to eliminate possible confusion in
routing castings for test purposes only
and to prevent any interference with the
production X-ray unit. The frequent
conferences of the metallurgist and
foundry and pattern shop foremen in
the X-ray inspection room would seri-
ously interfere with operations if the
development and production X - ray
units were combined. The development
X-ray unit should be located adjacent

1. Castings made in plant foundry 5000/day
2. Castings from outside sources 15000/day
3. Total castings 20000, day
4. Castings subject to X-ray examination according to the following groups:
Class I, requiring 25 per cent X-ray 8000/day
Class II, requiring 10 per cent X-ray 12000/day
Castings not requiring X-ray examination not listed:
Class I, to be X-rayed—8000 x 0.25 equals 2000/day
Class II, to be X-rayed—12000 x 0.10 equals 1200/day
5. Total castings for X-ray equals 3200/day
Government requirements for "spares" are included in these figures.

AS A FACTOR IN DESIGN
THERMAL expansion of materials
is a phenomenon that engineers
consider in varying degrees together
with its effect on engineering structures.
The extent of consideration is undoubt-
edly dependent upon the size of the
structure. A bridge engineer has always
recognized the necessity of careful con-
sideration of expansivity of the mater-
ials used. Fixed spans have their
expansion joints and movable spans
present a problem,—undoubtedly many
of you have had the unpleasant experi-
ence of delay or detour when an open
span has failed to close on a hot sum-
med day as a result of heating up of the
structural members while in the open
position. The road engineer provides
expansion joints between each concrete
slab to avoid buckling in the summer
heat. The steam engineer must provide
expansion joints or 'U" bends in his
long steam lines to prevent buckling or
serious distortion. Since the expansion
effect per unit is relatively small and
generally expressed in parts per million
per degree of temperature change, its
effect is apt to be neglected in dealing
with structures of small dimensions, but
this small effect of a powerful force
does not permit itself to be overlooked
if provisions are not made to accom-
modate it.
This situation is greatly aggravated
where metals of different expansivity
are used together in the same structure,
such as aluminum alloys with iron and
steel, and further when the operating
temperature range is fairly wide and
the clearances are small. Many engi-
neering difficulties have resulted from
the use in combination of high and low
expansion metals but, conversely, many
engineering advantages can also be
gained by the same combination when
properly applied.
The large increase in production of
aluminum, due to war demands and the
accompanying reduction in cost, will
result in its broad adoption in many
places where iron and steel were for-
merly used. Magnesium — of lighter
density and higher coefficient of expan-
sion—will also be available in great

be seeking new applications. Steel and
cast iron have the advantage of rela-
tively low cost and the disadvantage of
greater weight, but they have certain
valuable properties which have not been
duplicated by the light alloys. When
high strength, toughness and resistance
to wear are essential, steel has the first
call. Heat treated alloy steels have four
to six times the tensile strength of the
best aluminum alloys and many times
the hardness. The resistance to galling
of a hardened steel is many times that
of aluminum. But on the other hand, al-
uminum has one-third the density of
steel; one-third the modulus of elastic-
ity; about twice the coefficient of ex-
pansion; and several times its heat
conductivity. Steels have a definite en-
durance limit and when stressed below
the endurance value withstand flexing
indefinitely. This endurance limit, in re-
lation to its tensile strength, is of the
order of 50 per cent while with some
heat treated alloy steels this will be in-
creased to 60 per cent. On the other
hand, aluminum alloys apparently do
not have a definite endurance limit,
the stress-number curve continues
drop, although at a very slow rate, af(
many millions of cycles so the usef

Years of experience in the use of a
uminum alloys in combination with ire
and steel in the automotive and aircra
industries have shown the problem
not a simple one. Probably more mone
has been spent in developing aluminui
pistons for automotive engines with ca
iron cylinder blocks than on the balanc
of the engine. When cast iron piston
having the same coefficient of expansic
as the cylinder, are used the problem
quite simple and a relatively close clea:
ance can be employed, based upon th
difference in operating temperatures c
the cylinder wall and the piston itsel
The introduction of aluminum piston:
with approximately twice the coefficier
of expansion of cast iron, makes it n(
nessary to fit the pistons with muc
greater clearance when cold which re
suits in noisy operation until th
operating temperature is reached. Cor
siderable clever engineering has bee
utilized in the design of pistons to elim
inate this difficulty, often taking th
form of split skirts; oval pistons; strut
of low expansion alloys for controllin
the heat flow and expansion of the skir
to permit a close clearance, and new al
uminum alloys have been developei
with relatively low expansivity whicl
have been a great help.

can be traced to a lack of proper con-
sideration of the difference in expansiv-
ity of the metals used. A motor which
has operated satisfactorily all through
the summer months may show difficulty
with a leaky cylinder head on the first
cold day. A brief consideration of the
difference in expansion of, say, a 36
inch cast iron cylinder block and its
aluminum head over a temperature
range of 200°F. for summer to zero in
winter will result in a "difference in con-
traction of the two members of nearly
Iyi8 inch. The use of steel studs with a
cylinder head thickness of 2-V&amp; inches
will result in a difference in contraction
of 0.003 inches which makes it apparent
why the leakage occurred at the low
temperature. Where aluminum cylinder
heads are successfully used they are
short in length—either covering one or
not more than two cylinders—and high
expansion steel is employed for studs
with a coefficient of expansion close to
that of the aluminum alloy,—or some
compensating device is used.
Iron and steel alloys have been devel-
oped which approximate the coefficient
of expansion of the aluminum alloys.
When high strength is required, the aus-
tenitic stainless steels, such as the com-
monly known "18 and 8", are normally
readily available and give a satisfactory
matching for most jobs but, as shown
in Table I, other steels are available
with higher expansion properties which
permit close matching with the alum-
inum alloys.
Nickel plays an important part in
designing metals with desired coeffic-
ients of expansion. The addition of
nickel to ordinary steel in the amount
of several per cent has little effect on
its expansivity at normal temperatures.
The addition of greater quantities of
nickel results in the retention of austen-
ite with an increase in expansivity until
a peak is reached at about 20 per cent
of nickel, while further additions result
in a gradual lowering of the expansivity
until a low point is reached at the "In-
var" composition of 36 per cent of
nickel—beyond this point there is,
again, a gradual rise. The addition of
other elements, such as manganese,
chromium, and cobalt, influence the
trend so that it is possible to select an
alloy with a coefficient of expansion of
.000021 for a temperature range of 20
to 100°C. for the nickel-manganese-
chromium steel composition in Table I,
down to practically zero coefficient for
"Invar", and even with a negative co-

efficient over a narrow temperature
range with some special compositions.
While the above applies to wrought
steel, a similar range of expansivity is
available in cast iron, as can be seen by
comparing the expansivity of different
compositions listed in Table I. Plain
cast iron has approximately the same
expansivity as steel. High expansivity
is available in the austenitic cast irons
commonly known as "Ni-Resist". "Reg-
ular Ni-Resist" is alloyed with approx-
imately 14 per cent nickel, 6 per cent
copper, 2 per cent chromium, and has
an average coefficient of expansion of
.0000172/°C. in the temperature range
indicated, while "20 per cent nickel Ni-
Resist" has a slightly higher value at
.000018S/°C. Higher additions of
. nickel cause a lowering of expansivity
so that between 26 and 28 per cent of
nickel the expansivity matches that of
plain iron or steel, while at 30 per cent
nickel it is appreciably lower, and a
minimum in expansivity is reached at
about 36 per cent of nickel—above this
level it gradually increases. Thus, it is
possible to match with steel and cast
iron the expansivity of many of the

If you know this gent from Elmira,

Edward Rutan. An outstanding Aero
Senior, his washing of pots and pans for
various fraternities as a board job has
been the source of his initialed nick-
name.
In contrast, however, you may recog-
nize him as the current president of
Sigma Rho Tau. Having been with this

Ed Rutan
honorary society since entering Michi-
gan, and with his active participation
on the Sigma Rho Tau debate squad, it
seems a president was well chosen.
Surveying was Ed's occupation for a
while following completion of high
school. He liked his temporary job since
it was non-routine—"There was always
something different."
Although Ed was sure he wanted to
attend college, he could not immedi-
ately decide upon a specific profession.
Resorting to the proven process of elim-
ination, he arrived at engineering. To
narrow this field down, his former
hobby of model airplane building led
him to choose aeronautics. Ed, inci-
dently, is majoring in structures.
Continuing down his list of accom-
plishments, we aren't surprised to find
him a member of Tau Beta Pi. E.R.'s
academic achievements and other meri-
torious qualities well earned him this
recognition.
Rutan, in company with two of his
classmates, spent the between-semesters
vacation "roughing it" in the woods of
Wisconsin. The cabin in which they
were staying was infested with bats, and
after a three days battle of extermina-
tion, the bats won.
Ed has to watch his step on campus
as he has a younger brother to keep
tabs on him here. (Off the record, they
call each other "Zombie".)
Upon graduating, Ed .wants to work
for an air transport company—if the
army doesn't plan otherwise. He is
of the opinion that after the war there
will be a large expansion of aerial over-
seas traveling. Ed also believes the evo-
lution of large planes, capable of long
nights, will accelerate this prophesy. It
sounds like a good setup for Ed.

of his professional society and he has
also been elected to a number of honor-
ary societies, among them Sigma Xi and
Phi Kappa Phi.
Aside from his professional interests,
R. R. White is also an amateur magi-
cian. He hasn't found it necessary to
pull any rabbits out of his hat during
his classes but probably the courses in
themselves are mystifying enough to
some. In his spare time he might also
be found playing golf or billiards. He
didn't reveal his golf score, but he refers
to himself as a "ball beater." You can
usually find R. R. White somewhere on
the second floor in the East Engineering

student than an instructor. If you hap-
pen to walk into his office, don't ask the

Mr. White is, because that's not an

By
W. B. RUSSELL, "20E
rT^HE term "profit-sharing," as used
-*• in industry, is as misunderstood and
misused as the term "inflation" is in
economics. Many things are done by in-
dustrial managements under the cloak
of profit-sharing which may or may not
be true profit-sharing. Whether they are
depends entirely on the definition of the
term. It might be well here to discuss
profits and clarify our conception of the
word.
There are, in general use, certain well
defined rules of business accounting.
Based on these rules, profit, in any cer-
tain period, is considered to be the
amount by which total assets have been
increased after deduction of all liabili-
ties. That may sound quite simple, but
in actual practice the method of deter-
mination is somewhat elastic. So many
assumptions must be made that the
final amount arrived at as profit is al-
ways open to argument.
Most corporation accounting is kept
on an accrual, rather than a cash basis.
In our personal affairs we, as individu-
als, generally operate on a cash basis.
For example, if we buy a horse for $100
and sell him for $150, we have made
$50 profit—always assuming that we
make use of the $50 for food, shelter, or
amusement before it is lost on some
other business transaction. Operating
on an accrual basis, corporations must
estimate depreciation rates, value of in-
ventory, reserves for bad accounts re-
ceivable, future taxes on present in-
come, and other liabilities. These are
just a few of the most important as-
sumptions that must be made. Poor
judgment in determining these estim-
ated expenses may show a profit when
there actually is none. Profits are shown
monthly and yearly, but can only be
approximations. The only close deter-
mination of profits is probably the
actual payments of dividends over a
long period of time without depletion of
capital assets.
Whenever an individual or firm
shares a part of profits with his or its
employees, and such profits are deter-
mined after normal wages and other
payments to the employees are charged
to expense, then such division of the
profits with the employees is profit-
sharing. Normal wages consist of the
going wage in the community for the
type of work done by the employee and
are usually determined by supply and
demand. Other payments may be in the
form of group life insurance, health and
accident insurance, vacations with pay,
and miscellaneous indirect wages given
to employees.
At one time a large corporation in
Detroit raised the wages of all its em-
ployees and called it profit-sharing.
Immediately, all competitive industries
had to meet those new rates and the so-
called profit-sharing was nothing more
or less than normal wage rates deter-
mined by supply and demand. So, in
going back to a definition of the term,
it can be said simply that profit-sharing
is the act of voluntarily distributing
something from profits that is not re-
quired by force of competition.
Based on the above definition of the
term "profit-sharing", we find very few
firms that have true profit-sharing plans
or programs. However, mention can be
made of a few companies whose plans
are superior to most. The Proctor &amp;
Gamble Company, of Cincinnati, Ohio,
pays from 5c/( to 157c above the em-
ployees regular annual wage; the em-
ployee matches this with 57 of his own
wage, and the entire amount is invested
in company stock for a period of six
years. After six years, the employee
owns the stock and receives the extra
5% to I57i of his annual wage in cash
from then on. Both Sears-Roebuck &amp;
Company, and the Nunn-Bush Shoe
Company have plans similar to that of
the Proctor &amp; Gamble Company. The
Eastman Kodak Company pays a wage
dividend in cash, determined by years
of service, salary, and dividends paid on
the stock of the company. Westing-
house Electric &amp; Manufacturing Com-
pany adjusts the employees wages up
or down, according to profits, but not
below a base wage. These adjustments
are made monthly. The Hoskins Manu-
facturing Company, at Detroit, annu-
ally pays 25c/r of net profits—before
federal taxes—to its employees. The
foregoing companies represent some of
the leaders in profit-sharing.
Many companies have started some
form of profit-sharing only to later dis-
card the plan on the assumption that it
did not work. If it was a failure it was
probably because of improper admin-
istration or application, or because it
did not adequately meet the specific re-
quirements of the situation. Industry is
always quick to adopt anything that
promises a profit for the owner. In pro-
fit-sharing there is no visible profit to
the owner because the results are based
more on psychology than on definite
facts and figures. Most of the successful
plans now in existence were started by
managements who actually thought
they were giving something extra to the
employee with no thought of any meas-
urable return. But what happened? In
most cases of true profit-sharing, not
only the employee received more, but
the employer enjoyed greater profits.
This may sound impossible, but judging
from statements by officials of com-
panies operating on a profit-sharing
basis it is certain that every dollar paid
in profit-sharing has been more than re-
turned in added profit.
Some actual examples may clarify
this point: Back in 1932 a contractor in
Royal Oak learned of a sewer job to be
advertised for bids. At that time the
Depression was definitely with us; con-
tractors were anxious for work and were
bidding jobs so low that there was prac-
tically no chance, by ordinary methods,
to make a profit. This contractor
wanted a job to keep some of his best
men busy, but realized that if he bid
low enough to get the work he would
have no profit and might even lose
money. So he called the men in and
explained the situation to them. He
stated a figure that he thought would

A southern gas company recently was
faced with the problem of equipping
one of its compressor stations with a
cooling system. The station consisted of
six 800-hp. gas-engine-driven compres-
sors which would require from 60,000 to
70,000 gallons of water per day, and
during the windy spring months as high
as 100,000 gal. per day.
Either a 40 mile pipe line would have
to be constructed, or a different method
of cooling used. After tests on one of
the units, a radiator cooling method was
adopted. A total of eleven 8-ft. by 8-ft.
vertical radiator sections, each having a
93-in. variable pitch fan, was selected
and installed for engine jacket water
cooling. Constant speed motor drive
was used; flexibility being obtained
from the variable pitch of the fan.
In addition to cooling the engine
jacket water, it was necessary to cool
the gas after compression. Direct air-
to-gas heat exchangers were used in-
stead of the shell-and-tube exchangers
with water cooling as installed on other
stations. These radiators operate at 500
psi pressure and cool the gas to a tem-
perature not exceeding 10°F. above at-
mospheric temperature, with a pressure
drop not exceeding 7 psi.

Now for the first time, three-dimen-

Transparent bakelite models 1 inch

some turbines are 6 inches in diameter,

models are then annealed 3 hours at 120
degrees centigrade and cooled to room
temperature. Stress lines are frozen into
the models by the annealing, and are re-
vealed by passing polarized light
through Yx inch lengthwise slices cut

Results show that the maximum
stress is usually at the root of the

screech
With bombers traveling 300 mph,
speed of spreading warning is of prime
importance in air raid defense. A siren
produced by an automotive company
for air raid warning produces the loud-
est continuous noise ever created by
mechanical means.
To override city noises the necessary
sound level must be in excess of 70 deci-
bels at every point. The siren produces
sound at a 170 decibel level at the
throats and covers a two mile radius in
a downtown section.
The noise is created by high-fre-
quency disturbance of air. Air is com-
pressed by a two stage glower to 5 psi,
and then introduced to a six bladed re-
volving chopper. The chopper is 25
inches in diameter, and turning at 4400
rpm allows the air to surge into six
throats when they are uncovered by its

blades. The variations set up in the
throats cause the noise. The pitch is
440 cycles per second, the volume of air
handled 2500 cubic feet per minute, and
exit velocity is 360 mph.
An automobile engine is used to drive
the blower and siren to make the unit
independent of other power sources.
The motor is fluid-coupled to the siren
so that it can be started and idled with-
out driving the siren. Motor, radiator,
fuel tank, and battery are one complete

unit and are bolted to an 8 inch steel
channel frame, which in turn is mounted
on a turntable. Through a gear drive,
the turntable is driven to revolve once
every two minutes, thus giving radial
coverage. Revolving the "beamed" unit
gives more efficient coverage, and tends

On a series of 20 C-1A cargo motor-
ships, diesel motors were used rather
than steam. Two six-cylinder engines of
21 inch bore and 29 inch stroke are
coupled to a single propellor shaft
through electric slip couplings, and re-
duction gears.
The reduction gear set consists of two
pinions driven by the engines through
the couplings, driving a single double-
helical type of gear. The gear is of
welded construction instead of being a
single casting; the pinions are integral
with their shafts.
The electric coupling is of an air-gap
type and consists of two rotating mem-
bers. The inner member is of squirrel
cage induction design, and the outer of
salient-pole rotating field type with the
poles mounted on the inside of their
supporting rim. This structure in es-
sence uses an "armature" of a squirrel
cage motor and the "field" of a direct
current motor. Overall efficiency of the
gears and coupling is 96.5%.

This tale is told of one of the sum-
mer term freshmen. Tight-fisted Papa,
who had come up the hard way, wanted
to teach Junior the value of money, so
he put him on an allowance of ten dol-
lars a month for all incidental expenses.
But before long reports began to drift
back to the old home town to the effect
that Junior had a date every night, ate
his meals at the Allenel, and contri-
buted regularly to the beer shortage.
Papa came hustling out to Ann Arbor
to investigate.

"Next exercise, the Back Twister.
You all know it!" These familiar words
have rung out fifty times a day, six

mer. Few of us will forget "Chief" Jen-
nings' war on the stomach muscles, nor
Clarence Munn's ingenious contortions,
which, we suspect, were learned in a
Siamese torture chamber.

"How can you have such a wild time
on the money I give you?" stormed the
angry parent.
"Easy, Papa," said Junior. "I make
from thirty to thirty - five dollars a
month raffling off your allowance
check."
The big question is how much good
was done. With some of the men physi-
cal hardening has set in, and with
others rigor mortis. In a few cases, how-
ever, the results were purely mental—
being limited to the sharpening of the
wits. The ingenuity of the coaches in
devising new exercises was matched by
that of the students in figuring new
ways of gold bricking.
There were two such fellows—on the
hottest day of the summer their class
was to run from Ferry Field out to the
eighteenth tee of the golf course and
back. In the vanguard of the returning
runners were these two, putting on a
blazing sprint across Ferry Field to fall
in a heap across the finish line. The
coach sensed the prospect of a couple
of good cross-country men and rushed
over to congratulate them on their en-
durance. They seemed very reticent
about it and took the first opportunity
to make their departure. "Modest fel-
lows," thought the coach—until they
turned away. Their backs bore the un-
mistakable marks of the sharp edges of
the baseball grandstand seats.

dog, provided the dog has 20/40 vision
correctible to 20/20. This is going to be
pretty tough on the personnel men from
various companies who will be here to
interview seniors this' fall. "I'm sorry,
Mr. Dithers," the seniors will say. "I
like your position, but I have already
accepted an offer from a government
agency—the Selective Service Board."
Under these conditions we predict
that the reports of these men to the
home office are due for a radical change.
It is not so long since Mr. Dithers
would write: "Dear J. P.: We didn't do
so well this week. We only hired four
Tau Betes and three Ph.D.'s. And none
of them is an expert in more than two
or three fields. Let's hope for better
luck next week at Winsocki." But this
year: "Dear J. P.: What a killing we
made! At last we have found a real 4-F.
He is a moron and has two heads, but
one of them doesn't show when he but-
tons his coat. And we only have to pay
him $500 a week!"
We're very sorry, Mr. Dithers. We
like your offer, but things are so rest-
less these days that we have decided to
go off to a South Sea island until it all
blows over.

sorry!
We were going to tell the one about
the baby who said, "I'm fed up on

we won't.

to the foundry while the production
X-ray unit is best located near the man-
ufacturing division close to the produc-
tion machine shop.
The volume of experimental castings
and routine control work, requiring X-
ray examination will be small. It is es-
timated that not over 100 castings a
day will be sent to the foundry X-ray
laboratory for inspection even at the
start of operations in the foundry. After
close control has been established in the
foundry this number will be reduced to
approximately 1S castings per day. The
justification for the foundry X-ray unit
is based upon the following anticipated
work;
1. Foundry development and control.
2. Tensile and other physical test
samples required by specifications.
3. Spot welding development, control
and qualification tests.
4. Special problems: Correlation of
X-ray acceptable defects with actual
load tests. Preparing reference films of
limiting defects for production X-ray
use. Returned castings from inspection
department for special X-ray check.
5. Requests from the assembly line
for X-ray check of parts of completed
or partially completed assemblies.
Item number five, above, requires
special consideration as it affects the
choice of equipment which must be pur-
chased for X-ray examination. During

the sub-assemblies there may arise con-
ditions which would require X-ray ex-
amination in order to obtain acceptance
of the assembly.
III. Equipment Rccommendationss
The recommendations for equipment,
location, space required and general
equipment layout is based upon data
and calculations obtained from the pro-
duction and design departments. Where
exact information is not obtainable or
equivalent data not available reasonable
estimates are made based upon the most
probable conditions liable to occur.
Two X-ray laboratories are proposed
as discussed in Section II, and will be
considered separately.
A. Foundry X-ray laboratory. A small
compact, portable, air-cooled X-ray unit
of 100 kilovolt maximum capacity is
recommended. This unit is obtainable
from several sources completely self
contained and can be used on any con-
venient 110 volt A.C., outlet. The X-ray
tube equipped with 25 foot cables is
very small allowing easy access to dif-
ficult sections in the assemblies.
The layout shall consist of four rooms
conveniently located adjacent to the
cleaning and inspection sections of the
foundry. The four rooms comprising
500 sq. ft. of floor area are as follows.
1. X-ray room lead lined.
2. Dark room with batch type pro-
cessing units.
3. Film viewing, file and consultation
room.
4. Ante room to X-ray room to be
used as storage, preparation and work
room.
B. Production X-ray equipment. An
entirely automatic production type X-
ray unit of 140 kilovolts capacity is
recommended. This unit shall consist of
a lead lined tower mounting the X-ray
tube centrally located over a conveyor
table. Several designs are being submit-
ted by manufacturers of X-ray equip-
ment.
The automatic X-ray unit will be de-
signed to repeat each cycle of opera-
tions every two minutes. Continuous
operation on three thifts, twenty-four
hours a day would allow 720 exposures
per day. This volume is sufficiently
above the required number of exposures
to allow for unexpected occasional de-

WORN teeth no longer render crush-
ing equipment useless, nor do they
mean long, costly delays. Today there
is a simpler, faster, less expensive way
— hard facing with the Airco Oxy-
acetylene Flame. Reports indicate that
teeth built up by this proved Airco
process last longer, yet cost only 25%
of a new segment. Cost of replacing
the entire crusher is, of course, far
greater.
Airco Hard-Facing is a versatile
process. Wearing parts of varying
shape and size can be rebuilt econom-
ically, speedily. Standard oxyacety-
lene welding apparatus is employed.
Not only for maintenance of equip-
ment, but on thousands of production
lines, the Airco Oxyacetylene Flame is
on the firing line speeding countless
defense products to completion. It has
been drafted to cut steel to any desired
shape, to flame harden metal parts for
longer life, to weld two or more metal
parts into a strong, lasting unit, to ma-
chine metals with unrivaled speed, to
clean and dehydrate metal surfaces
for lasting paint jobs.
A pictorial review "Airco in the
News" shows in an interesting manner
these many uses of the flame. Write

Standard bimetal shapes
light aluminum alloys and thereby avoid
difficulty due to wide differences in ex-
pansion properties and gain the advan-
tage of the high strength, wearing
properties, resistance to galling, as well
as resistance to heat and corrosion.
Where good wearing properties are
desired in an aluminum structure a liner
of Ni-Resist will give excellent results.
It has been used for liners of aluminum
alloy cylinders. A very close match in
expansivity is secured with the "Lo-Ex"
aluminum alloy—however the Ni-Resist
liners also work well with the other al-
uminum alloys having a higher expans-
ivity, for the difference in expansion is
compensated by the liner operating at
a slightly higher temperature than the
jacket so that it remains tight at all
times.
Several methods of construction are
used; the cheapest one is to cast the
aluminum alloy around a preheated Ni-
Resist liner. While the bond may be
largely mechanical, due to the similarity
of coefficient of expansion, there is no
tendency to loosen. Liners may be ma-
chined and pressed or shrunk into an
aluminum cylinder. With this combina-
tion a "trunk" type aluminum piston
can be used with close clearance. Ni-
Resist has been used for valve guides
and as inserts in aluminum pistons for
piston ring lands; also for bushings, in-
serts and guides and wearing surfaces of
moving parts. The combined use of Ni-
Resist and aluminum has solved many
problems and extended the utility of
both materials.
It has been demonstrated that the
use of metals in close combination is
often desirable for optimum engineering
properties but if they have a wide dif-
ference in expansivity the practice is
fraught with danger. However, the ad-
vantages of steel and cast iron can be
retained and the expansion difficulties
overcome by selecting special composi-
tions of steel and cast iron which match
closely with the expansivity of the light
alloys. Now it will be demonstrated that
these same characteristics of high ex-
pansion and low expansion which often
prove so troublesome can, when prop-
erly coordinated, be made into a very
useful engineering tool. This is probably
best illustrated by the extensive use of
bi-metals in thermostatic controls. In
making thermostatic bi-metals, two
metals with a wide difference in expan-
sive properties are selected, such as
"Invar" for one side of the unit and a
high expansive stainless steel on the
other. These metals are welded or in-
timately brazed together and rolled into
thin strip. When heat is applied to a
portion of this strip the "Invar" side is
scarcely affected while the high expan-
sion side expands considerably and re-
sults in the strip becoming bent or
warped. With the removal of the heat
the strip will return to its normal posi-
tion, thus providing an operating prin-
ciple which is widely applied in a great
variety of ways in many useful instru-
ments, such as thermometers; oil burner
controls; electric current controls:
safety devices: operating alarms; con-
trolling the temperature of flat irons,
heating pads, refrigerators; and many
other household and industrial uses.
The uses which have been made of ther-
mostatic bi-metals in one product—the
automobile—are listed:
1. Cooling water temperature control
2. Carburetor starting choke
3. Carburetor hot air control
4. Carburetor fast idle control
5. Generator current cut-out
6. Generator temperature compensator
7. Lighting circuit cut-out; instead of

8. Gasoline gauge; tank and dash

grinds out projectiles!


Imagine a machine that grinds out 37-mm projectiles
almost as easily as you'd sharpen a pencil! Getting
the precision of form and finish necessary for accur-
ate shooting was once a much slower procedure. But
that was before Carborundum helped develop the wheels
for centerless grinding of projectiles. Now the pro-
cess is simple. First, slice off a piece of cold
rolled steel bar stock to exact length with an abrasive
cutting off wheel, turn the nose to approximate profile
and heat treat to required hardness. Then feed this
piece between the specially shaped wheels of a center-
less grinder...and...out pops a projectile!
Centerless grinding is perform-
ing hundreds of operations in a
fraction of the time previously
required. And Carborundum has
led in developing centerless
grinding wheels, which are
speeding the output of valves,
pistons, shafts, and other prod-
ucts necessary to win the war.


At Carborundum, all our energies are
centered on the single objective
of helping industry do a better job
through the better use of abrasives.
When you need information on grind-
ing, our facilities and experiences
are at your disposal. The Carborundum

lays based upon the following calcula-
tions.
1. Two films can be exposed on each
mobile tray giving a rate of one film per
minute.
2. An average of three castings per
film.
3. Castings to be X-rayed per day—
3840.
4. Films, size 14" x 17", required per
day—1280.
5. X-ray machine exposures—640.
6. Maximum capacity of X-ray unit
—720.
7. Margin of capacity available, ex-
posures—80.
An automatic developing machine is
proposed to handle the large volume of
films required for the production X-ray
unit. A standard, commercial unit is
available used by professional photo-
graphic processing companies which can
be adopted for processing large size
X-ray films. This unit has a calculated
maximum capacity of 150 films per
hour or 3600 films per 24 hours which
is well beyond the requirements.
The following provisions must be
made for secondary operations in con-
junction with the X-ray process.
1. Storage and working space at each
end of the production X-ray unit for
handling the large volume of castings
being prepared for X-ray or shipping.
2. Storage room, with controlled tem-
perature, adjacent to the dark room for
film and chemical storage.
3. Balcony near dark room for mix-
ing chemical solutions. Gravity feed
lines running into dark room to the de-
veloping tanks.
4. A special section or room at end of
production section for viewing and stor-
ing of the X-ray films. Equipment for
preparing reports and general office
work will also go into this room.
The above report gives a brief sum-
mary of the requirements for X-ray
examination of the large number of
castings required for aircraft construc-
tion. After tentative approval has been
obtained a detailed layout will be pre-
pared and complete bids requested from
reliable firms for the equipment re-
quired.

synthetic insulation
Until the recent development of syn-
thetic resins and drying oils, the im-
pregnants applied to coils contained
linseed or china wood oils, or natural
resins. Those materials would set by ox-
idation on the surface leaving the in-
terior in a semi-fluid state. In the unset
portion, fatty acids were usually present
—sometimes in sufficient strength to
corrode copper. These drawbacks may
sometimes be avoided by using wax and
resin compounds, but the low melting
points of these materials may require
potting containers and large safety fac-
tors in coil design to prevent the impreg-
nating medium from liquifying under
ordinary conditions.
Varnishes made with synthetic resins
of the phenol-aldehyde type avoid most
of these limitations. They polymerize on
drying rather than oxidize, and produce
a solid state throughout their mass. Cor-
rosive tendencies are negligible.
When thoroughly dried by baking
at elevated temperatures they are no
longer thermoplastic. This allows coils
to operate at high temperatures.
The penetrating power of these syn-
thetic resins which leave few voids in
the coils, and their high dielectric
strength make them particularly valu-
able for high-voltage circuits where cor-
ona discharges might occur. These must
be minimized because corona in voids
filled with air oxidizes the nitrogen and
produces nitric acid which breaks down
the insulation.
PROFIT SHARING
(Continued from page IS)
get the work and asked them if they
would do the job for that amount, less
a small percentage for his own overhead
and profit. They agreed to do the work
at the price stated. He bid the job, was
awarded the contract, and the men com-
pleted the work. Never, in his exper-
ience, had he seen a sewer job done so
efficiently. The work actually hummed.
After it was completed he computed the
hourly rate of the men and in some
cases it was found to be more than 50^
over their regular rates. What was the
reason? The men saw a real profit in-
centive, with the result that their effic-
iency and output were increased con-
siderably. Both the employees and the
owner made profits where, under ordi-
nary methods, no profit existed.
The effect of profit-sharing can be
shown quite clearly by the following
example: Assume that a contractor is
building a sewer for which he receives
$10 per foot for labor. Assume also that
it takes one man a day. at $7.00 per
day, to construct the sewer. That would
give the contractor a profit of $3.00 per
foot per day. Now, let the contractor
offer the workman one-third of the pro-
fit. That would, on the surface, indicate
that the workman would get $8.00 and
the contractor $2.00 profit per day. But
that is not what would happen. The
workman, seeing a chance to get more
than $8.00 per day, works harder and
more effectively and builds, possibly,
one and a half feet of sewer per day.
Then the contractor would get $15.00
—of which the workman wou'.d receive
$7.00 base wage plus two-thirds of
$8.00, of $2.67, making a total of $9.6"
per day—and the contractor would get
$5.33 per day for his profit. In general,
that is the way profit-sharing works,
but it takes long periods of time and
concerted action to convince stockhold-
ers and directors that it pays dividends
when properly used.
Not much detail has been given about
the plans of the varisus companies men-
tioned, but a fairiy complete explana-
tion will be made about the plan used
by a company in Detroit. It is axiom-
atic that certain conditions must exist
to have true profit-sharing:
1. There must be a profit.
2. Wages paid must be equal to or bet-
ter than going wages in the community.

American planes, tanks, trucks, guns and

their designers know their bearings.
After Victory, when we have made sure that the things our
forefathers fought and died for shall not perish from the

For when the tremendous work of reconstruction starts,
machines of all kinds will be required to have higher speeds,
greater precision and endurance and be more economical to
operate and maintain than ever before.
In achieving these objectives, Timken Tapered Roller Bear-

because of their ability to meet—and beat—any and every
bearing condition that might develop.
Now is the time to learn to know your Timken Bearings.

"Joan k."
Don't try to date this engineer, for
although last year's directory listed him
as "Joan Koffel, he is better known
as John. Kalamazoo has been his home
for eighteen years after a three year
start "down on the farm." Yes, John
has a "gal in Kalamazoo"—as well as
in Ann Arbor, Detroit, and points East.

John K. Koffel
Although John transferred to Michi-
gan from Western Michigan College in
the summer of 1941, his campus ac-
tivities have been increasing after a
short time of intensive studying. Last
year he built up the membership of
A.S.M.E. and was elected president for
this year. He has been giving machine
tool demonstrations to the ordnance
material inspectors as well as working
on a honing research project. This sum-
mer, Tau Beta Pi elected him to mem-
bership; he is serving on the Engine
Council, and this fall will find him as
staff man for some of the East Quad
men.
For recreation John plays tennis, and
while in Kalamazoo traveled over most
of the nearby streams and lakes by
canoe. At some time or another he has
passed through all the states—but not
in a canoe!
John has the true engineer's respect
for the value of the dollar sign. His
financial career started when he reaped
a handsome profit by selling a radio
built from three junked ones. Western
Michigan offered a happy hunting
ground to John and he took over the
job of running the public address sys-
tem for their folk dances. In his eyes
this was a good bet since he was paid
for it, met all the freshmen girls, and
talked his way into gym credits for it.
Another hobby paid off when he formed
the Koffel Korporation with brother
Bill and sold about fifty 6-inch scale
model airplanes constructed between
them.
A swell fellow and a "sharp" engin-
eer, John would like to be in the pro-
duction engineering end of the aircraft
industry after graduation. Second choice
is testing in his field, but he expects his
probable position to be with the Naval
Reserve.

he and two other fellows drove 1700

Those of you who are less famili
with Phil, know of him as a varsity er
on the football squad. While in Englar
he played rugby, a similar game, so wil
that preparation along with his natur

have TWO kinds
of future
The dominant consideration, now, is
your immediate future. Many of you are
enlisted in the reserve, or are already com-
missioned. You do have a valuable training
which the country needs in this emergency.
Make every day count in perfecting that
training.
The war you will undoubtedly help to
fight is not a nice war. But as we see it, the
United Nations intend that it shall have not
only a victorious ending, but also a hopeful
ending—hopeful in the sense that we shall
have a peace in which our goal shall be jobs
for all men.
You have a right to know that industry is
even now beginning to dream up the where-
withal for those jobs—new things to make,
and new ways to make old things better.
A lot of everyday sort of men, many of
them very much like yourself, doing this
kind of thinking in the past, are the reason
Alcoa Aluminum became the leader in the
aluminum business. They are the reason
Alcoa Aluminum will have such a big part
in the future.
Call this kind of thinking Imagineering
—letting your imagination soar and then
engineering it down to earth. It is perhaps
the most important talent a man can have. It
is the point of view that industry will
always need, and use, to make America a
better place to live in.
There is no "pay-off" in this little mes-
sage. We just wanted to have you know that
folks like us can be completely devoted to
high-speed war production, and have an
eye on a good future for all men, at the
same time.

PROFIT SHARING
(Continued from page 26)
The amount of money to be shared with
the employees is determined by a set
formula. Beginning at 17.3% of the
profit at zero, it increases up to 25% of
the profit at $700,000. 25% of the pro-
fit is the top limit. After determining
the gross amount to be distributed, the
individual shares are computed by for-
mula. The employees are divided into
six classes, determined by years of serv-
ice and position. Each class is given a
distribution ratio per dollar of salary
earned. The lowest is 1 and the highest
is 8. Knowing the total amount to be
distributed, the classification and an-
nual wage of each employee, his or her
share of the profit is then computed ac-
curately to the penny. One of the rea-
sons for having an exact formula for the
distribution is to convince each em-
ployee that no partiality is shown to
any individual. Many plans have failed
to have the desired effect—even though
enormous sums are distributed—simply
because there is no definite formula,
and the division among the employees
is determined by a few men at the top
of the organization. Personalities often
enter into their decisions and the re-
sulting jealousies among the employees
defeat any good that might come from
the profit-sharing. In the Detroit com-
pany, described above, the only one not
receiving a share of the profits is an
employee with less than one year of
service with the company.
Here are the results of profit-sharing
in this firm: profit every year since
1935, cash increased from $350,000 to
$500,000. All this has been done in an
area where their product is sold at a
price lower than anywhere else in the
United States. Their profit, after profit-
sharing, was a greater percentage of their
gross sales in 1939, 1940, and 1941
than any other company selling a sim-
ilar commodity, and whose statements
were available. Their profit-sharing plan
has played a very important part in
whatever success they have had. Taking
all phases into consideration, true pro-
fit-sharing, when properly administered,
is of great benefit to both employer and
employee.

PROFESSIONAL ETHIC
By Dr. E. W. Blakeman
IN 1938, at the suggestion of Pn
dent Alexander G. Ruthven, it
came my pleasant duty to raise
committee upon professional ethics
some of the larger Colleges. For \
College of Engineering, Professor R
S. Swinton became the Chairman. T
work initiated through his idealism a
wisdom has moved forward year af
year. This year, Professor Donald
Katz will serve as chairman and t
student convenor will be William 1
Hutcherson.
According to the pattern develop
during former years, five activities w
engage us: (1) an outstanding pract
ing engineer will be brought to the Ui
versity as a lecturer, introduced
Dean Crawford, and asked to lead in
series of faculty-student discussions
engineering practice and ethics. (
Each society in the College will
asked by the committee to devote o
program to professional ethics. (3) T
Technic, beginning with the Novemt
issue, will run a problem to which st
dents may write possible solutions,
competent committee will award t
sum of five dollars for the best one. (&lt;
Seniors and graduates, on occasion, wi
faculty men as resource leaders, will a
semble in groups to discuss informal
the problems apt to be confronted I
the young engineer. (5) "Ethical Situ
tions," a file of actual cases in the fiel
will have steady attention during tl
year, thus increasing the literature upt
the subject.
On Thursday afternoon, 4 P.M., tl
second week of the fall term, the sti
dent-faculty committee will meet I
consider modifications necessary f(
"the duration" and to deliberate upo
nominations for the lecturer upon Er
gineering Ethics.

BLAZING THE WAY
TO FASTER PRODUCTION
As EASILY as a knife cuts through pancakes, this
white-hot oxy-acetyleiie flame zips through stacks of
steel plates. .. turning out metal parts in a fraction
of the time required by other methods.
Cutting as many as twenty plates at a time, this
knife that never dulls... guided by positive tem-
plates ... can follow the sharp twists and turns of
highly complicated patterns. Oxy-acetylene stack-
cutting saves shaping, machining, and assembly time.
It produces parts of identical size and shape. It re-
duces scrap losses ... makes possible substantial sav-
ings in subsequent machining and fitting operations.
Stack-cutting is only one of the many oxy-acety-
leiie processes for cutting, fabricating, and treating
metals which manufacturers are using to speed up
production today. Whether cutting up scrap... or
skinning steel alive by planing a light cut from the
four sides of steel blooms as they speed down the roll
table — or helping to shape and weld finished steel
... the oxy-acetylene flame is a tireless worker in
modern manufacturing.
Would you like to know how flame-cutting and other oxy-
acetylene processes could be applied to your business? You are
cordially invited to avail yourself of the store of knowledge
Linde technicians have assembled over a long period of years.

SUMMER SEMESTER SCHOLARSHIP
THE war has caused the programs in
almost every field which has any
relation to the present and future pro-
duction of war materials and related
necessities to be speeded. Like the rest,
our centers of education throughout the
nation have been impressed with the
constant demand for engineering-
trained manpower and accordingly step-
ped up the program of learning so that
their technically trained men would be
early available to the industrialists.
Those of us who have successfully or
unsuccessfully trodden another mile-
stone in our college curriculum this
summer look somewhat with disdain on
the semester we are completing. Schol-
astic standings will be considerably
lower if obvious indications materialize.
It is not that the students have not had
the ambition to proceed with their
study work, but rather that the sum-
mers heretofore have been a combina-
tion of hard work and frequent
relaxation. Nervous energy, a source of
the driving force which keeps many
people going in school has almost been
drained this year.
So many people are on either the
verge of being drafted or are close-
pressed by some other influence which
will affect their immediate future that
the necessary constant and diligent ap-
plication to studies has not been too
prevalent. One of the largest sources of
friction will probably appear this fall
when the students who have relaxed
with a summer vacation will return to
compete with the tensed students who
have kept on the job during the sum-
mer.
The point is, that all of us realize
that we have a job to do. Industry
needs us and the more quickly we can
get out there where our skills may be
profitably applied, the nearer we are to
completing our personal missions in the
war effort. The organization of curricu-
lar programs, the idiosyncrasies of indi-
vidual personalities who have been
thrown together because of the war, and
the general mental reactions of many
people who have been forced to become
slightly ascetic for the benefit of their
country as a whole, are only a few of
the effects which add up to produce a
strained condition on human relations.
This condition is something about
which we can do nothing except make
for the best.
To many engineers, war production
will demand maximum effort from them
for the duration. Students, like these
practicing engineers, must learn to work
at maximum productive capacity in ac-
cordance with their ability to maintain
good health and a proper mental at-
titude.
Since scholarship is the main criterion
upon which a student's ability is judged,
he must keep one eye on his grade av-
erage, while his other eye is examining
the state of his physical and mental
health. No one can ask more of him
than the best he can give but many
superiors will demand that maximum.
Since the student must necessarily di-
vide his attention, it is with this atti-
tude that we view scholarship today as
perhaps, a measuring standard which
has lost some of its accuracy.

There exists a very evident need for the correlation of
available data on mechanical springs, and for the
formulation of a standard code for the design of heli-
cal springs. As a result, a group of specialists have
made suggestions in a symposium, published in the
July 1942 Transactions of the A.S.M.E. which it is
hoped will crystallize into early action.
The scope of a proposed code, design stresses, the
arrangement and scope of helical spring tables, the
advantages and disadvantages of nomographic
charts, and the future research needed on mechanical
spring problems are all discussed in the symposium.
Serious attention to the problem of mechanical
spring design began in 1924 with the establishment
of the A.S.M.E. Research Committee on Mechanical
Springs. Since that date, 66 papers on the subject have
appeared in various A.S.M.E. publications. They have
laid the groundwork for a design code which, 'when
completed and adopted, should simplify the work of
designers. The symposium contains a bibliography.

examination of a few of the latest de-
velopments which, if it had not been

developments are: glass that won't break
and will float; wood that won't burn
and laminated wood that will equal
structural steel in strength; shoes that
contain no leather; window screens that
contain no wire; bearings that contain
no metal and fuels that will give fifty
miles per gallon. These and countless
other innovations will be taken for

we successfully complete the task at

... In spite of, rather than because of,
the recent plea for prohibition made by
the righteous ladies of the W. C. T. U.,
the production of liquor is out for the
duration. The conversion of distilleries
to war production of alcohol was sug-
gested by an organization of the dis-
tillers themselves prior to Pearl Harbor,
but no governmental action was taken.
The conversion was entirely voluntary,
and one hundred per cent transforma-
tion to war production was realized
before the government got around to
issuing conversion orders.
By making alcohol from surplus grain,
the distilleries will save nearly 1,200,000
tons of sugar in 1942 and produce
enough alcohol to make 200,000 tons of

wear and is resistant to many solvents
which attack rubber.
... For examining magnetic and non-
magnetic materials for flaws, two new
methods have been devised. The first
method, for magnetic metals, involves
fluorescent indications under "black
light." The parts to be inspected are
magnetized giving a uniform magnetic
field except in areas where defects cause
flux leakage. A commercial indicating
material is then applied to the part, the
particles being drawn into the areas of
leakage fields. This causes an accumula-
tion of particles at the flaw which is visi-
ble under "black light."
For non-magnetic materials similar
indications are secured as fluorescent
lines under "black light." By use of a
suitable penetrant and rinsing agent the
fluorescent "picture" coincides with sur-
face discontinuities.

... Insurance statistics have shown that

which to reduce this blight on industrial
efficiency is a recently designed non-skid
topping for floors, either wet or dry. The
mixture, added to the Portland Cement
and water, is composed of an assortment
of carefully graded sharp, hard particles
of mineral emery, which rates next to
diamond in hardness. The non-slip qual-
ity of the floor topping actually im-
proves with wear due to the greater
exposure of the hard particles and the
resulting improvement in grip. Where
loads are being moved by a hand truck,
greater traction is said to be obtainable.
Another advantage of this material is
the fact that experiments have shown
test specimens to have a greater capac-
ity for load than ordinary concrete
floors.

ROBERT HAY, '43E
TN this report the essential ideas un-
-*■ derlying the theory will be presented
without the use of mathematics.
The Theory of Limit Design is at-
tracting the attention of engineers for
the following reasons:
1. It is relatively simple to learn and
apply.
2. More accurate predictions of the
limit load (maximum carrying ca-
pacity) of redundant structures can
be obtained by use of this theory.
3. Former rule of thumb specifications
can now, as a result of this theory,
be brought into the open and re-
garded as the outcome of rational
procedures.
4. Its use makes possible the saving
of time, money and materials.
The essential ideas upon which the
Theory of Limit Design is based are
as follows:
1. Neither stress nor elasticity is a
reliable criterion of the strength of
a redundant structure, whereas per-
missible deformation is.
2. Failure of ductile metal occurs by
excessive deformation long before
it breaks.
3. Sharp distinction is made between
the magnitudes of deformations in
the elastic range of a material and
those in the plastic or buckling
range.
4. A redundant structure (also known
as a statically indeterminate struc-
ture) is one in which two or more
members, reactions, or restraints
function to the same end.
5. When a load is applied to a well-
designed structure having one or
more redundant members, the de-
formations do not exceed those or-
dinarily incurred in the elastic
range until all the redundant mem-
bers and one additional member
have reached their elastic limit (or
critical buckling load).
The Theory of Limit Design can be
employed for the analysis of ductile
metals provided that severe and fre-
quent stress reversals are not present.
It is especially valuable in those fields
where designs embodying strength
coupled with lightness are at a pre-
mium.
Stress no Criterion oj Strength
According to the Theory of Limit
Design, stress is not a true criterion of
the strength of redundant structures,
but permissible deformation is the pri-
mary consideration for determining the
maximum load that a structure can
safely carry. It will be shown, in this
regard, that a structure may be perfect-
ly safe even though its redundant mem-
bers are stressed beyond their respec-
tive yield points. Whereas adherents

jLoao
£~/G / Ca3L£T Aa/AI-OGV
to ordinary theories base their analy-
ses upon the consideration of stress con-
ditions at low working loads, the pri-
mary consideration should be the be-
havior of the structure under the max-
imum possible loading conditions which
occur within the ductile range of the
material. Of course, an actual struc-
ture is never intended to be subjected
to stress above the elastic limit under
normal loading conditions. Therefore,
the typical Limit Design procedure is
to multiply the working load by an
overload factor to obtain a limit load
for the structure. If this factor were
two, for example, the structure would
not deform excessively until it was
overloaded one hundred per cent.
Elasticity No Criterion of Strength
Perhaps the most important phase of
any theory is the original assumption,
for that determines where the theory
is applicable. It logically follows from
theories predicated upon elasticity that
when the elastic limit is exceeded the
structure will fail, and conversely, so
long as the elastic limit is not exceed-
ed, the structure is safe. But our com-
mon sense would not permit us to build
an airplane wing of glass even though
glass can now be obtained which is
nearly perfectly elastic and of high
strength. It follows that elasticity it-
self is not a satisfactory criterion of
strength.
Effect of Redundancy Upon Strength-
Cable Analogy
Has the engineering profession been
in error all these years in applying the-
ories based upon elasticity? The an-
swer is, no. For until recent times en-
gineering structures were statically de-
terminate, such as, for example, pin-
connected trusses. Such structures fail
by deforming excessively when the elas-
tic limit is reached. Thus, ordinary
theories are here applicable and accu-
rate.
However, most modern structures are
welded or riveted instead of being pin-
connected and are consequently highly
redundant. That is, they contain more
than one element to perform a single
function. A simple chain is a statically
determinate structure; so the ancient
proverb that a chain is no stronger than
its weakest link is true. But this com-
monplace must not cloud our thinking
with reference to redundant structures.
For example, the strength of five chains
or cables in parallel as shown in Fig.
1 is not necessarily determined by the
strength of the weakest chain or cable.
In this structure there are three redun-
dant cables functioning as supports, for
only the two thicker outside cables are
necessary. Even if the structure were
so heavily loaded that the inside cables
were stressed beyond their elastic lim-
its, the deformation of the structure as
a whole would be elastic. This, there-

as well as possible by the invention and
development of light polarizers.
In order to understand more clearly
the possibilities and uses of polarized
light let us first understand what is tak-
ing place.
According to the undulatory theory,

Stopping the Light-Wave-Front
Courtesy of Polaroid Corporation
light is assumed to be a form of energy
transmitted in waves in the ether, which
pervades all things and space. The
propagation of light takes place accord-
ing to the laws of wave motion, the
ether particles vibrating at right angle?
to the direction of propagation. The
velocity of propagation has been de-
termined to be approximately 186,000
miles per second.
In the case of ordinary light, the
vibration of the ether particles takes
place in a plane at right angles to the
direction in which it is traveling, but
the vibration direction in this plane is
constantly changing. If a ray of light
is considered as being propagated per-
pendicular to the plane of this page.
then the vibration of the ether particles
will be at many angles lying in the
plane of the page.
In plane polarized light, in which
most all practical applications lie, the
vibration takes place in a definite di-
rection within the plane and at right
angles to the direction of propagation.
A favorite analogy to explain the
production of polarized light is with a
rope and a pair of picket fences. One
end of the rope is tied to an object
and then is set in vibration. These
waves, though traveling the length of
the rope, are also vibrating in a hori-
zontal, vertical and many other direc-
tional plane between these two ex-
tremes. If we now place a picket fence
in the path of the rope, it is forced to
vibrate in only a vertical direction as
the vertical pickets absorb all the other
directional vibrations. Therefore, all
vibrations coming through on the other
side are traveling in but one direction.
This corresponds to polarized light
emerging from a plate of tourmaline, a
Nicol prism, or any other polarizing
medium. This is plane polarized light
Let us now place a Venetian blind in
the path of the rope that is now vibrat-
ing in only the vertical direction. The
resulting difference is that the slots
through which the waves have to pass
10
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


looking at the other side of the blind
the experimenter will see that the rope
is perfectly still and is not vibrating at
all. This phenomenon is caused by the
fact that the horizontal slots will allow
only waves vibrating in a horizontal
direction through. Since all horizontal
waves have been removed by the verti-
cal picket fence the blind will absorb
the vertical waves. That is analogous
to what happens when another plate of
tourmaline or Nicol prism with its axis
of polarization perpendicular to the first
is placed in the beam of polarized light
issuing from the first plate or prism.
All the rest of the light is absorbed and
darkness results.
One of the light polarizing films is
a set suspension of dichroic crystals, in
a uniform orientation, in a matrix em-
ploying cellulose acetate. The film may
be made in various thicknesses, usually
between 0.001 and 0.004 of an inch.
As the thickness of the film is increased
the transmission decreases and the de-
gree of polarization of the transmitted
light increases. In order to give the
film stiffness and to protect it from
damage, it is mounted upon or between
sheets of glass or other transparent ma-
terial.
The individual crystals in the film
are very small needles whose girth di-
ameter is considerably less than the
wave-length of visible light. When light
enters one of these crystals it is divided
into two components polarized at right
angles to each other; and, by virtue
of the dichroism of the crystals, one
of these components is absorbed more
strongly than the other.
We can regard a sheet of Polarized
film as a three-dimensional system of
oriented crystals, closely packed to-
gether in the matrix. The crystals are
so small and their concentration so
great that the structure of the film is
invisible, except under special condi-
tions. At magnifications of 1100X or
greater and with polarized illumination,
it is just possible to discern discontinu-
ities in the film.
If these small crystals are to be used,
their polarizing axes must all be turned
the same way in uniform orientation.
Plainly they must be made to overlap
to cover the entire area. These micro-
scopically small crystals have to be so
small that they cannot be seen even
in a high-powered microscope. The only
way of finding out whether or not they
are polarizing crystals is to orient them,
but it was far from sure that the ori-

Clarc Conside
enting technique would work with such
small crystals and tests for orientation
could not be accomplished without
knowing that these polarizing crystals
were present. A mass containing un-
oriented polarizing particles in polar-
ized light is blackish and opaque, since
the little individual polarizers are
crossed with one another. When the
crystals are oriented, the mass should
become white and transparent.
The orientation was finally accom-
plished by placing a mass of suspended
crystals on a matrix of an elastic na-
ture and stretched. As the stretch is
increased the crystals turn parallel to
the direction of the stretch, approach-
Cowtesy oj Polaroid Corporation
rably Reduced
ing perfect parallelism as a limit when
the stretch is continued.
The industrial and civilian applica-
tions of polarizers are numerous. One
of the more popular uses is in the form
of sunglasses. When the rays from the
sun or sky strike smooth highways or
the surface of water, they are reflected
from the surface as partially polarized
glare. By looking through Polarized
lenses, the eyes see a view without hav-
ing to pierce a film of blinding glare.
This brought about by having the ab-
sorbtion axes of the lenses perpendicu-
lar to the wave front of the partially-
polarized glaring light. Visibility with-

As a rule, wagon drills are shifted
from one operating position to another
on their own wheels and are used to
drive vertical holes and toe holes.
There are exceptions to every rule,
however, and this was the case with
this wagon drill. The drill was mount-
ed on a truck to raise it and thus en-
able it to drill horizontal holes at points
in hillsides that would otherwise have
been beyond its reach. Another advan-
tage of this setup was even greater
portability than the machine itself af-
fords. The necessary compressed air
to operate the drill was furnished by
a compressor also mounted on a truck.
At one point where the excavating
and rock removal had been completed,
the hillside above the road suddenly
began to move. The resulting slide
took the compressor and its truck with
it, almost completely burying them. The
compressor was found to be pretty well
but not hopelessly battered up. It
went back into service after repairs
totaling about one-eighth the cost of
a new machine. Parts of the truck
were found, but not enough to prevent
its being listed as a complete casualty.

precision pieces by this method is now
in full swing in the United States. The

alent to those made by other methods
involving casting, forging, etc. In cer-
tain developments, the properties of
cast and forged material actually have
been surpassed.
Copper powder formed by electro-
deposition from solution, compressed
into compacts under a pressure of 30
tons per square inch, and sintered in
hydrogen for about half an hour at a
temperature of 950°C has a tensile
strength of 23,000 to 25,000 psi with
an elongation of 17 to 19 per cent.
These properties were greatly improved
by re-pressing and annealing. Copper,
brass, aluminum, and iron powders are
the principal ones employed in manu-
facture of high-density parts by powder
metallurgy, copper being used at the
rate of about a million pounds per
month. Other powders can be and
are used, but to a minor extent.
There are two main limitations to the
use of powder metallurgy. First, only
relatively small parts can be made—
48-inch diameter parts are the largest

to be made is of great importance;
pieces with re-entrant angles and com-
binations of thick and thin sections
transverse to the direction of pressure
application are not readily adaptable to
this process.
The advantages of powder metal-
lurgy are: (1) Rapid production. Three
hundred parts per minute are being
produced on one machine with multiple
dies. (2) High dimensional accuracy.
With a 2-inch major dimension, it is
possible to hold tolerances to ±0.001
inch. (3) Low scrap loss. This process
has no equivalent of machining losses,
and dusting losses are less than one-
half per cent. (4) Utilization of un-
skilled labor. The design of dies re-
quires great skill, but the bulk of labor
used in pressing and sintering can be
relatively unskilled.

If wings are ever put on a jeep, we
would not be surprised to see it fly.
This versatile little truck has been
used in almost every other way, the
latest being as a tugboat.

cided to try something else for towing

board motors usually used. They

the wheels. The paddles are about 4
inches wide and 6 inches high, shaped
to fit under the wheel lug nuts, but not
extending beyond the rim. This elim-
inates the danger of the paddle being
bent into and cutting the tire, and
enables the jeep to continue under its
own power on mud or sand bottom, or
to climb up river banks if conditions
permit.
Speeds of 5 or 6 mph are possible.
The tugboat can be steered by using
the steering wheel and four-wheel
drive, and backed by using the reverse
gears.

OF
OIL FLOW
JOHNC. STAUDT.'BIE
SOUND petroleum practice formerly
depended upon mechanical and pe-
troleum engineering, but in the past
few years new chemical developments
have provided methods which greatly
improve the desired results.
Acidizing is one example of the pro-
gressive steps being taken in applying
chemistry to the production of oil.
This process originated ten years ago
and is in use today in all oil and gas
fields producing from limestone reser-
voirs.
Chemistry oj Acidizing
Acidizing makes use of a very simple
chemical reaction between hydrochloric
acid and limestone. Hydrochloric acid
(sometimes called muriatic) is one of
the common mineral acids widely avail-
able in large quantities.
Limestone is a common mineral and
is particularly interesting to the oil
industry because it is a reservoir for
oil, and many wells throughout the
United States are drilled to limestone
formations to get the oil that is to be
found there.
When hydrochloric acid and lime-
stone are put in contact, a chemical re-
action takes place converting the rock
and acid into a harmless gas (carbon
dioxide) and a water solution of miner-
al salts similar to oil well brine.
How Acidizing Works
An oil field, spoken of as a reservoir,
is not a cavern underground complete-
ly filled with oil. Rather, the rock is
porous and has small voids in it that
are connected, and oil is found in these
small openings. When a well is drilled
into such a formation, the oil and gas
existing in these small pores and chan-
nels flow into the well.
The flow of oil and gas through these
extremely fine openings in the rock fol-
lows the usual laws of flow. The high-
er the pressure, the faster the flow of
oil and gas. The larger the cross-sec-

tion of the channels, the larger the flov*.
The same principles that apply to forc-
ing water through a garden hose or oil
through a pipeline also apply to the
natural flow of oil and gas from the
formation into the well.
Often these channels are so small
that the flow of oil and gas into the
well is negligible and the well is not a
commercial producer unless something
is done to speed up the rate of flow.
Sometimes the well has come in as
a commercial producer, but the flow
has decreased to such an extent that it
is not producing enough oil for profit-
able operations.
With the aid of acidizing, it is pos-
sible to open up the channels so that
the oil will again flow in commercial
quantities. As the oil and gas come
closer to the hole, restricted spaces pre-
sent large resistance to flow. By the
application of acid, the pores and chan-
nels immediately around the hole are
opened up and, in effect, other exits
have been opened up into the hole,
allowing the oil to come in more freely.
Acidizing, then, is not a method of
creating oil, nor is it a method of cre-
ating pressure so that the oil will move
into the hole. Rather, acidizing is a
chemical method of reducing friction so
that the oil and gas that are stored
in the rock can be produced and
brought to the surface of the ground
more easily.
In acidizing a well, a solution of hy-
drochloric acid, properly inhibited to
prevent action on the metal equipment
in the well, is forced down into the
bottom of the well and then pressure
is applied, actually forcing the acid out
into the rock through the small chan-

Drawing by J/. Lfnt-Koop
14
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC

Acid-to-Well Service
nels and pores that already exist there.
In many wells pressures of more than
5.000 pounds per square inch have been
needed at the bottom of the well before
the acid would go into the rock.
Under pressure the acid will travel
back from the face of the hole into the
rock. The acid is allowed to remain in
the rock until the chemical reaction has
taken place. The result is the removal
of constrictions and the enlargement of
the openings by actually dissolving the
rock. Both the gas and the water-sol-
uble salts are now easily removed from
the well by flowing or pumping.
The action of the acid, therefore,
permanently changes the rock at the
base of the well, leaving it in a condi-
tion which permanently favors in-
creased production.
Typical Results of Acidizing
Results obtained by acidizing vary
greatly from well to well, as results de-
pend on subsurface geological condi-
tions, presence of oil in the formation,
formation pressure, type of oil and other
similar factors over which no control
may be exercised. However, individual
case histories show typical results that
are generally expected.
The Dundee limestone producing
extensively in Michigan responds very
well to acid. A typical result was ob-
tained on a well in the Greendale pool,
Midland county, Michigan. After the
first treatment, production from this
well leveled off at approximately double
the pre-treatment production.
All wells treated are not large wells.
In fact, some of the best treatments
from the standpoint of economic pay-
out have been made to small wells. A
"stripper" well in the McCamey pool,
Upton county, Texas, maintained for
over three years a production rate of
four times pre-treatment production.
An increase of three barrels of oil per
day for three years made this old well
a profitable producer again.
Methods Used in Applying Acid
The development of acidizing natur-
ally had to take into account the diffi-
culties in working with chemicals as
much as two miles below the point at
which they were introduced into the
well. Most chemical reactions take
place in a laboratory or in a plant
where the operator can usually see
what is going on. Sometimes the plants
are large, but still the operator can see
where his chemicals are going, can take
samples and watch very closely the ac-
tion taking place.
The methods of control that have
been worked out in the ten years that
acidizing has been practiced are now
quite involved except in the hands of
trained engineers with years of produc-

Federal Government specializing in
aeronautics and the technicians of the
aircraft industry collaborate on a very
extensive scale to produce the most ef-
ficient aircraft in the world in the lar-
gest quantities ever projected. These
co-operative efforts take many forms.
The airplane as an instrument of
warfare and an important factor in the
transportation and general commercial
interests of our country at home and
abroad, has received, in contrast to
other products of industry, the con-
stant attention of engineering special-
ists and many other persons employed
by the Federal Government. This in-
terest and attention by the government
has produced numerous procedures and
tate the preparation of estimates of
engineering costs to be charged against
contracts or projects.
Engineering students interested in
aircraft work should exert themselves
to become familiar with the technical
rules and regulations issued by the gov-
ernment and with the industrial or-
ganizations created to work with the
government. Knowledge of this ma-
terial will prove useful to the graduates
who enter the employment for the air-
craft industry, as well as those who ac-
cept positions in the several technical
departments of the government.
It is beyond the scope of this article
to present anything approaching a com-
plete list of the government aircraft
publications referred to by type in the
craft Design Criteria.-' This organiza-
tion consisting of an executive commit-
tee and technical sub-committees made
up of government specialists operates
under the general supervision of the
Aeronautical Board.
The functions of ANC Committee, as
defined by its directive, are:
1. To develop aircraft design criteria
governing: imposed loads, structur-
al design, allowable stresses, meth-
ods of analysis, methods of testing,
performance calculation, etc., and
recommend the adoption of these

publications which are applicable to
contracts devised by the services (Army
and Navy) and the aircraft and air-
craft parts design approvals projected
by the civil aviation authorities. These
procedures, technical reports, manuals,
specifications, handbook requirements,
or airworthiness standards developed
by the aircraft technical specialists of
the Army, Navy, and Civil aviation
agencies, have an important bearing on
the aircraft design and production pro-
cesses conducted by the numerous
plants in the aircraft industry.
Many of these Government publica-
tions have general application to the
work of the industry and thereby have
a semi-permanent status. Most of the
publications, particularly the specifica-
tions, are subject to frequent revisions
to keep abreast of improvements in the
state of the art and the usual demands
for increased performance.
Industry, therefore, must maintain
an active interest in this work. In ad-
dition to the strictly technical interest,
manufacturer's engineering departments
also must keep in touch with the cur-
rent status of these specifications and
design requirements in order to facili-
foregoing paragraphs. Some of these
publications are mentioned in the fol-
lowing discussion of particular aspects
of the technical collaboration. The
discussion will be restricted to the fol-
lowing:
1. Army - Navy - Civil Committee on
Design Criteria.
2. Working Committee of the Aero-
nautical Board.
3. Technical Committees of the Air-
craft Industry's Trade Association.
4. National Aircraft Standards Com-
mittee.
There are other organizations which
could be mentioned as examples of the
technical teamwork between govern-
ment and industry. These include agen-
cies specializing in research and devel-
opment work and the engineering or
technical societies. The activities of
the engineering societies are described
adequately by their trade journals and
society brochures.
1. Army - Navy - Civil Committee on
Design Criteria.
Dating from 1936, the Federal Gov-
ernment has made use of a joint tech-
nical organization which is designated
"Army-Navy-Civil Committee on Air-

criteria by the three member
branches of the government.
2. To arrange for such studies, tests,
investigations and conferences as
may be necessary for the develop-
ment of these criteria.
3. To arrange means for exchange of
16
THE MICHICAN TECHNIC


these criteria between responsible
personnel in the member branches
of the government and for mainte-
nance of effective liaison.
4. To arrange for promulgation, in-
cluding publication, of criteria
adopted by the member branches of
the government in the form of AN'C
bulletins.
The AN'C Committees have made
use of many technical contributions
made by the aircraft industry toward
the development of aircraft design cri-
publications. These contributions by
the aircraft industry are developed by
a group of specialists functioning as a
subcommittee of the Aeronautical
Chamber's Airplane Technical Commit-
tee. This industrial committee organ-
ization is discussed in Part III.
Many engineering students are al-
ready familiar with AN'C publications,
particularly AN'C-5, "Strength of Air-
craft Elements." This publication is
an outstanding example of what can
be accomplished through the co-ordin-
ation of technical facilities of several

We Have These and More
teria. In addition, advance copies of
AN'C publications are circulated by the
government sponsor to technical spe-
cialists in industry for comment prior
to the final printing. Industry in turn
initiates comments and recommenda-
tions on the AN'C program and AN'C

government agencies with those of the
aircraft industry. The records show a
distribution of 12,000 copies for this
publication, indicating it is being used
in many educational institutions, as
well as in industry and government.
The AN'C program does not interfere
with or prevent direct contacts by in-
dustrial units with the Army, Navy or
C.A.A. Discussions of individual con-
tracts or projects are always handled
directly by the parties involved.
The AN'C program is good evidence
of the ability of government aircraft
technicians to co-ordinate their views
and to do so in co-operation with the
vast reservoir of technical experience
and data available in the industry.
The value to industry of well-defined
rules and corresponding interpreta-
tions known to be acceptable to the
three agencies of government specializ-
ing in aeronautics is obvious. Such a
program saves time and money for in-
dustry and government alike and is
bound to yield superior technical treat-
ment of the numerous problems en-
countered.
II. Working Committee oj the Aero-
nautical Board.
The Federal Government has air-
craft organizations which develop and
issue the specifications required for the
guidance and information of bidders
and contractors. These procurement
specifications reflect the particular
needs of the Air Services (Army and
Navy).
You can picture the tremendous ad-
vantages which accrue to both gov-
ernment and industry when single spe-
cifications acceptable to both services
are issued for any of the numerous
products and materials used.
The Working Committee of the
Aeronautical Board is charged with the
responsibility of producing ANA (Ar-
my-Navy-Aeronautical ) specifications
and the requisite AN" drawings, which
are procurement documents acceptable
to and used by both services. The
Working Committee was established in
1937 to project such work. This body
of specialists staffed by personnel sup-
plied by both Air Services spends full
time in reconciling the differences be-
tween existing or projected practices of
the two agencies. The volume of AN
and ANA material made available for
the use of interested contractors or gov-
ernment procurement officers testifies
to the diligence and efficiency of the
Working Committee, particularly dur-
ing the last year or so.
The process of developing and issu-
ing new or revised AN specifications in
final form includes, whenever possible,
co-ordination with the interested par-
ties in the industry. This is accom-
plished in the main in industry through

To his brothers in the Delta Tau
Delta house, he is known as "Cagey";
to the R.O.T.C., he is Captain Ed-

Engine Council it is Mr. President. Re-
gardless of titles, Jim Edmunds ranks
high among Michigan Engineers.
If you have tried to match wits with
Jim, you can appreciate the title, "Ca-
gey." Contrary to what you might
expect, though, it originated the day
he slipped up behind an unsuspecting
squirrel and grabbed its tail. If you
are not convinced that is quite a feat,
try duplicating it on Ann Arbor's ed-
ucated little beasts.
One of Jim's main interests has been

army ordnance. Last summer he in-
spected ISS-mm. howitzer shells for the
Cleveland ordnance district, and at
present is teaching two sections of ord-
nance material inspectors in inspection
practice. He is also a member of Scab-
bard and Blade and a cadet captain
in the R.O.T.C. unit.
Commuting between Ann Arbor and
Toledo, his home town, makes Jim's
weekends rather busy. In spite of ra-
tioning and transportation shortages,
he maintains a real interest in a neat
bit of femininity. Some of his other
hobbies are footing the light fantastic
and small game hunting.
On campus Jim was an active mem-
ber of the Union Junior Executive
Council and the Engineering Honor
Council during his junior year. At
that time he was also elected to Tau
Beta Pi and Triangles. Vulcans have
tapped him this year.
If you want to hear some good jokes
and also see a class full of women, drop
in on one of his ordnance classes. On
the serious side, though, Jim believes it
is up to the graduate engineers to pro-
mote and raise the status of engineers
to a recognized profession along with
the lawyers and doctors. Instead of
being slide-rule pushers, handbook
thumbers, and hammer mechanics, he
thinks they should be the distinguished
leaders who will guide the technically-
trained masses of men this war is cre-
ating. As president of Engine Council,
we know he will do a fine job in pro-
moting this spirit among Michigan's
engineers.
The army ordnance will make good
use of his talents for the immediate fu-
ture, but after the war Jim hopes to
enter into production engineering and
eventually manage his own plant.
uncle rudy
Rudy M. Smeja began his official
existence on December 1, 1920, in
Chicago, Illinois. Born of Bohemian
parents who were still speaking their
native Slavish at home, Rudy had
many difficult times going to school
with American children. In fact, every
time he had trouble speaking during
his first school year, he would imme-
diately revert to Slavish. For this rea-
son, his teacher thought it best for him
to stay around to learn to speak English
—so Rudy flunked the first grade!
Having never moved from Chicago,
he attended all his preparatory schools
in that vicinity. He and Ceithaml met
each other at Lindblom High School in
Chicago. He was almost totally devoted
to athletics in high school, winning two
letters in football and one in swimming.
Incidentally, he hadn't yet had his first
date when he was a senior in high
school. As president of the senior class,
he forgot his speech on graduation day
much to his parents' consternation.
The summer following this prep
school graduation, he and three of his
athletic friends drove a Model A 3600
miles around Canada and New England
before they cracked up in a fog near

he hopes, will be the use of this knowl-
edge as a member of the new Navy
Construction Battalion.
Rudy is a member of Triangles, Vul-
cans, M Club, and Alpha Tau Omega.
He is also very proud being a Michigan
man, an attitude which is fortified every
time he makes a trip with the football
team. In this capacity he is probably

Every engineer at one time or an-
other has spent two or three semesters
in East Hall. Although many of our
engineers do not anticipate with pleas-
ure their meeting with the English
language, one of the men who has tak-
en upon himself the Herculean task of
teaching them the language is Profes-
sor Ivan H. Walton of the English De-
partment of the College of Engineer-
ing.
Prof. Walton has been a member of
the English Department since 1919,
and for twenty-three years has defend-
ed the English language from all at-
tacks by the engineers. He was born
some 49 years ago in Mt. Pleasant,
Mich., and received his Teacher's Cer-
tificate from Central Michigan Teach-
ers' College in 1913. Continuing his
studies at Michigan, he received his
bachelor's degree in 1917. When the
war broke out (the first World War)
he entered the Air Corps, where he
spent 19 months. After the war, Prof.
Walton returned to Michigan and ob-
tained his master's degree in 1921.
In 1919 he was made an instructor
in the English Department of the En-
gineering College, and has remained
here ever since. In addition to his
teaching duties, he has held various po-
sitions in connection with the Publica-
tions of the Department of Engineer-
ing Research.
One of Prof. Walton's greatest inter-
ests is in the Folklore of Michigan. He
has spent a great deal of time gathering
this type of material and has written
several articles on the subject. Two
years ago he spent part of the summer
recording folk material in northern
Michigan, and considerable time in the
ports of the lower lakes gathering ma-
terial for his "Michigan Sailor Lore.''
He is also very well known among
the modern literary circles of the
United States. Often noted writers
come to Ann Arbor and spend an eve-
ning or two of conversation with Prof.
Walton at his home. With this com-
bination of activities, Prof. Walton
might well write an autobiography.

life while still in high school. There
he was in the band, Hi-Y, editor of the
school paper, class secretary, and half-
back on the football team. His college
career follows the same lines.
On graduation from high school,
Chuck decided the U. of M. offered
him the best in Chem Engineering in
this part of the country, so he became
just another student—but not for long.
Now Chuck is Associate Editor in
charge of the Sophomore Staff of the
Daily, Corresponding Secretary for the
Army Ordnance Association, Vice-
President of Scabbard and Blade, past
president of A.I. Ch. E., and a member
of Tau Beta Pi, Vulcans, Triangles, Phi
Eta Sigma, Student War Board, Mich-
igamua and Sigma Chi. In addition,
he also works for his board and as part
of the staff for the ordnance inspectors
course. Chuck is a mean trombonist,
playing in the Michigan band and oc-
casionally in dance bands.
Chuck is an ardent enthusiast of sail-
ing and a lover of music. A sudden
squall one summer parked him and his
boat on a lighthouse for thirty-six
hours. Since there was no shore com-
munication, preparations were under
way to drag the waters for one, Charles
Thatcher, by the time the winds abat-
ed.
Chuck is now a resident of Escanaba
when not in Ann Arbor, and although
he has ties there, is still available to
the Michigan coeds here (Call 4489).
With a rank of Colonel in the R.O.T.C.
Chuck is the highest-ranking Cadet of-
ficer and spends much of his time act-
ing in this capacity. He says that noth-
ing else matters now but winning the
war and expects to go to Aberdeen,
Md., the home of the Army Ordnance
Department, upon graduation.

Our secret informer swears that this

Detroit. He was called in one day for

a conference. In order to get to Detroit
bright and early he purchased a ticket
and went to the station to catch the six
o'clock train. This particular train was
typical of those which pass through our
fair city—somewhere up the line it de-
veloped a leaky gasket which slowed it
down to a snail's canter. Time marched
wearily on at the station until finally
the seven-thirty train pulled in.
"Is this the six o'clock train to De-

"No suh," replied the porter. "That's
still up the line a piece. This here's the
seven-thirty train."
Prof. Cissel waited another hour for
the six o'clock train to arrive and take
him to Detroit.

The football season has come, and
with it has come that peculiar phe-
nomenon known as Typical Football
Weather. The part that is peculiar is
that while other places have it on foot-
ball days, we have it every day but
football days. Much has been said
about Typical Football Weather in
Ann Arbor, most of it unprintable.
Mark Twain said that nobody ever did
anything about it, but of course, he
lived sixty years too soon.
We have been conducting an inves-
tigation on the sly and are now ready
to publish the results. Our professors
say that this report is, no doubt, the
outstanding nonentity of the age, which
makes us very proud.
There are four major theories about
what causes the weather, as follows:
1. Ann Arbor is located at the cross-
roads of two great paths of bad wea-
ther across the country. Sometimes we
have the bad weather going from
southwest to northeast, and the rest of
the time we have that going from
northwest to southeast. Sometimes we
have both—as on picnic days.
2. The geographic theory takes into
account the heating effect of the sun,

the rotation of the earth, inertia of air
masses, and about two thousand other
factors. It is too difficult, so we will
pass on to the third theory.
3. Some guy named Joe Btfsplk lives
here. He is the guy upon whom it is
always raining. This seems rather sil-
ly to us.
4. Someone said that the weather is
a manifestation of the laws of thermo-
dynamics. Testing this theory, we
found that we got the same results
when we muttered to the elements.
"PV=RT," as we did when we used
those expressions we learned in the
Cavalry. This theory, therefore, has
obvious inconsistencies.
Having thus discovered the secret of
the weather, we are ready to give the
world the remedy for it. You will have
to wait until we get our diving suit
fixed, however, as it looks like rain.

We thought we knew all the cute
little games like The Prince of Wales
Has Lost His Hat, Cardinal Puff, and
that one where you thump the table
twice, call out a letter, thump twice
again; the next person gives a word
beginning with that letter, and so on.

That is, we thought so until we dropped
in at the Liberty Street Study Hall the
other night and found two gentlemen
playing Hack-Hack. This delightful
pastime is played as follows: One man
holds the other's wrist in one hand and
a table knife in the other. He raises
the knife and hits the wrist as hard as
possible with it. The object is to see
how deep a gash he can make. Then
they exchange the knife and the other
man does the same thing to the first.
Then both of them laugh hilariously.
We liked the game and played it a
little while just to get our hand in, but
quit while we could still get it out.

Before you call Long Distance, please ask yourself:
1. Is it really necessary? 2. Will it interfere with war calls?
TELEPHONE lines — especially Long Distance circuits — are
crowded as never before, these war days. Materials to build
new lines—copper, rubber, nickel—are needed for the shooting
war. So we must get the most out of present facilities.
You can help us keep the wires clear for vital war calls if

fore, is an example of a structure
which would not fail merely because
some of its members were forced to
carry their maximum possible stress.
The progressive engineer will take ad-
vantage of these facts and adapt his
design procedure accordingly.
It is appropriate at this point, to
consider what happens to the cables
which have been stressed beyond their
elastic limit. Their elastic properties
and mode of failure will now be pre-
sented.
Load-Deformation Relationships
Figure 2 is a load-deformation curve
plotted from data obtained by labora-
tory experiment on a three-inch I-
beam. It shows that when the elastic
limit is surpassed in a redundant struc-
ture, small, permanent deformations oc-
cur in that portion whose elastic limit
was exceeded. It also shows that when
the load is re-applied the member be-
haves elastically up to a new, higher
elastic limit stress which corresponds
to the highest previous stress in the
material. Thus it is apparent that the
elastic properties of steel are actually
improved by being loaded in such a cy-
cle.
Ductile Metal Failure
It should be emphasized that steel
(or any other ductile metal) fails by
excessive deformation long before it ac-
tually breaks. In fact, properly detailed
steel structures are very difficult to
break. To demonstrate this fact, a
three-inch standard I-beam was placed
in a Riehle testing machine and bent
nearly double without showing any
signs of breakage. It would not have
broken if it had been tied into a knot.
Limit Design Experiment
To lend weight to the argument that
the Limit Design method is more ac-
curate than the conventional means of
predicting the failure of redundant
beams, direct experimental evidence ob-
tained in the Materials Testing Labora-
tory of the University of Michigan on
May 3, 1942, will be presented.
Procedure
The procedure followed was first to
predict the maximum carrying capacity
of the three-inch standard I-beam
shown in Figure 3 by use of one of the
standard methods (Elastic Energy or
Area Moment), then again by the The-
ory of Limit Design, and finally to
(Continued from page 9)
load the beam to destruction as a check
upon our calculations.
With the setup used, a horizontal tan-
gent to the elastic curve at the mid-
point (point A, Figs. 3 and 4) of the
beam was obtained. Considering only
the right half (AC, Figs. 3 and 4) of
the test beam, one can see that it is
in effect an ideal cantilever beam with
an additional (or redundant) end reac-
tion at A. This ideal cantilever beam
with a horizontal tangent could not
have been obtained by actually bury-
ing one end of the test beam in a wall
because the elasticity of any wall would
permit the end of the beam to deflect
through a small angle when a load was
applied to the beam.
Method of Calculating Limit Load
The results of a control test on a
simple three-inch I-beam were used in
the calculations instead of an assumed
value for the maximum allowable
stress in steel. It was reasoned that if
the maximum deformation of the con-
trol beam were considered safe accord-
ing to ordinary standards, then the test
beam also would be safely loaded so
long as its deflection did not exceed that
of the control beam. This condition
was satisfied up to 95^ of the limit
load (See Fig. 2). From the graph of
the control test the maximum resisting
moment that the test beam was capable
of exerting was 64,000 inch pounds in
the elastic range and eight per cent
more in the ductile range. By use of
the smaller of the maximum bendin?
moments in an Area Moment or
Elastic Energy equation, along with two
equations from statics, the failure load
was predicted to be 14,420 pounds.
Whereas, from calculations based upon
the Theory of Limit Design, in which
was used the larger value of the bend-
ing moment characteristic of the ductile
range of the material, the maximum
load was calculated to be 21,600
pounds, which represents a fifty per

SOMEWHERE on the tough hide
of U. S. warships are mounted
■what look like inverted glass mix-
ing bowls.
These are the radio lead-in insula-
tors, the "ears" through which the
battle wagons get their orders. They
are made of Pyrex brand electrical
glass, as are the insulators in the
ships' antenna, because the service
requires the best and most depend-
able materials available.
Today, with metals scarce, the raw
materials for glass are fairly plenti-
ful. And glass is being put to work
at many urgent tasks. Planes, tanks,
ships, trains, for example—all use
some contribution of Corning re-
search in glass. The giant dairy in-
dustry, faced with a metal piping
shortage, is now working with
special glass piping recently devel-
oped at Corning. In chemical, food,
and explosives plants, glass piping
and glass pumps are handling every-
thing from soup to HCL.
Years ago glass was regarded as
a fragile, decorative, costly material
with limited applications. Now
Corning makes glassware that has
kicked old barriers out the win-
dow. It's tough and strong, resist-
ant to chemical attack and
thermal shocks, widely varied
in shape and size, reasonable
in cost, and accurate to toler-
ances comparrVig favorably with
metals. Today's engineers are dis-
covering that they can put glass to
practical uses which in the past
were labeled, "impossible". For
tomorrow's engineers, glass is the
material of unlimited possibilities.

applied plastics
With shortages and priorities becom-
ing more evident every day, substitutes
for the critical metals are welcomed by
industry. The printing industry is
favorably viewing new
plastic duplicating print-
ing plates which may be
used to replace electro-
types and stereotypes in
many printing applica-
tions, thus conserving
strategic metals such as
copper, zinc, tin, antimo-
ny, and lead.
These new plates are
made of a vinyl resin, and
are capable of meeting or
surpassing the standards
set for metal plates. They
meet all requirements of
work up to 75 line screen,
and may be used on flat-
bed or cylinder presses.
Length of service is com-
parable to that of the
copper electrotype, and there is no cor-
rosion problem in storage. The weight
of the plastic plate is only one-eighth
that of the conventional copper plate,
facilitating handling and reducing mail-
ing costs.
Another plastic development that is
by its makers, by a modified extrusion
process assures a smooth, round ma-
terial. Sharp standard pipe dies can
be used to thread the pipe, so that it
can be used with conventional metallic
fittings or saran plastic fittings. The
weight of this pipe, one-fourth that of
similar iron pipe, again makes shipping
and handling easier and cheaper.


releasing steel for other uses is a new
plastic pipe. Tough, durable, flexible,
and non-scaling this pipe is resistant to
the solvent and corrosive action of oils,
soaps, chemicals, and moisture.
Production of the pipe, named saran
Courtesy Petroleum Engineer
Welding saran pipe is a simple and
swift procedure and can be done in less
than one minute. Two ends are placed
upon a heated surface (350° to 400°F.)
until a small amount of molten material
has formed. The ends are then joined
and allowed to cool for a few seconds.
Within 24 hours the
joint has strength
equal to any other
portion of the pipe.
Saran pipe with-
stands freezing and
continuous heat up
to 170°F. Its prop-
erties make it es-
pecially adaptable
to high pressure as
well as low pressure
applications.
Injection molded
fittings of the same
plastic material used
in the extrusion of
tubing are especial-
ly adaptable to
threaded precision
parts. It is impor-
tant that they be tough, durable, and
accurate so they will stand up under
extremely difficult applications formally
requiring metal. The tubing may be in-
stalled with most metal fittings or with
special fittings molded of Saran itself.

PROFESSIONAL ETHICS
A FIVE-DOLLAR prize will be given
to the engineering student submit-
ting the best solution to the accompany-

Room 3036 East Engineering on or be-
fore December 3 to be considered for
the prize money.
PROBLEM
Jim Stephens, a graduate of the class
of '42E, is working for the LTnion Man-
ufacturing Company. While he was a
student in the engineering school, he
had several jobs to earn expenses, in-
cluding that of research assistant to
Prof. William Hard. Jim worked on a
research project for the Plastic Wood
Corporation to develop plastic adhe-
sives for plywood. He made tensile
and bending tests on specimens of ply-
wood which had been prepared from a
series of adhesives. Among the new
developments in the problem was the
addition of wetting agents to the adhe-
sive to give penetrations and increase
the effectiveness of bonding mate-
rial. Jim received a copy of the prog-
ress report made for the client just
prior to his graduation.
On June 15, Jim reported to his new
job expecting to enter some phase of
the aircraft parts manufacture conduct-
ed by the Union Manufacturing Com-
pany. After a short series of tours in
the plant to get acquainted, Jim re-
ported to his supervisor for assignment.
His supervisor told him that he was to
assist on a new problem to develop ply-
wood for plane construction since his
experience while in school would be of
value to the project.
That night Jim had a long session
with his roommate deciding how much
of his experiences and the report on the
project for the Plastics Wood Corpora-
tion at the university he might divulge
to his supervisor or use on his job.
If you had been Jim's roommate,
what counsel would you have given
him?

The wheel that cuts tank armor
like a sharp knife slices bread!

When steel men made tank armor that could withstand
anti-tank fire, they put our army one up on the
battlefield. But they posed a new problem in tank
construction. Precision cutting of the armor plate
is necessary at many places to insure contact for
welding. But because of its toughness, ordinary
mechanical cutting methods wouldn't do. What was
the answer? With Carborundum Brand Cutting-Off
Wheels, the 1-1/8" armor plate is now sliced like
you'd slice a loaf of bread. And so accurately
that mating parts fit perfectly.
These abrasive wheels have revolu-
tionized cutting-off methods. Often
of extreme thinness, they even
perform such delicate operations as
slotting the points of fountain pens!
Today Carborundum-made Cutting-Off
Wheels are used to cut plastics,
glass, brick, tile, steel and non-
ferrous metals in plate and bar stock
...faster, more safely, and more
economically. In most cases further
finishing is unnecessary.


America's war program has thrown a
new spotlight on the vital role which
abrasives play in industry. This role
is one which Carborundum "know-how"
and skill have helped to create. When
you take your place in industry,
you'll find these same facilities
ready and able to render an invalua-
ble service. The Carborundum Company,

out glare results with only a slight dar-
ening of the general scene.
Other applications of natural polar-
ization are reading lamps that polarize
the light at its source; photographic
filters made of Polaroid glass are also
used to cut out glare so that the film
will not suffer the effects of halation.
Many unusual effects have been ac-
complished by photographers using po-
laroid as a sky and also as a copying
filter.
One of the largest future uses of
Polaroid materials will be for head-
lights and windshields of cars. It will
demonstrate the use of extinction of
light by "crossed polarizers." One way
this may be brought about is the plac-
ing of the absorbtion axis of the wind-
shield of one car at a 45-degree angle
with the horizon and inclined from low-
er left to upper right. At the same
time the absorbtion axis of the head-
light lens of another car will be placed
at a 45-degree angle and also perpen-
(Continued jrom page 11)
dicular to the axis of the windshield
when they are facing each other. For
it is apparent that each driver would
see his own light as it illuminated the
road, because the rays reflected by ob-
jects illuminated by his headlights
would pass through his windshield;
whereas his windshield would have its
absorbtion axis crossed with those of
an approaching headlight.
One of the uses of interference of
polarized light is in the inspection of
bottles. The glassware to be subjected
to examination is placed between two
large sheets of Polaroid film to see if
the glass has been properly annealed to
remove destructive strain. A cord-free
or homogeneous ring section will appear
uniformly dark while a cordy or un-
homogenous section will be easily rec-
ognized by the appearance of cords or
white streaks in a dark blackground.
Scientists photograph the sun through
Polaroid filters to determine the struc-
ture of the sun's corona. Jewelers put
gems between sheets of Polaroid film
to investigate a true gem.
Another important use by engineers
is to foretell how efficiently the struc-
tures they are designing will carry the
proposed loads. Areas of high stress
will appear as blackened regions with
the lines of stress clearly outlined. This
phenomenon is also of great interest to
research workers in the fields of engin-
eering mechanics and structural design.
An unusual application of Polaroid
material is in the field of three-dimen-
sional motion pictures. In the Chrys-
ler Motors Exhibit of the New York
World's Fair, visitors received Polaroid
glasses and were startled to see the as-
sembly of a Plymouth car take place
before their eyes. Similar motion pic-
tures have been made and shown ex-
perimentally but in full color as well as
in three dimensions.
The day is not far distant when Po-
laroid materials will be familiar to
every household and industry.

the Aeronautical Chamber's Technical
Committees, the National Aircraft
Standards Committee (NASC) and the
Aeronautics Division of the Society of
Automotive Engineers (SAE). The ac-
tivities of the first two are described
in Parts III and IV of this article.
Many of the projects handled by the
WCAB require conferences in Washing-
ton, at Wright Field or at the Naval
Aircraft Factory. Industry is invited
to participate in many of these meet-
ings. These opportunities supplement-
ed by the government's practice of so-
liciting comments from industry on ad-
vance copies of specifications and stan-
dards ensure a full technical treatment
of the subject matter and thus facili-
tate the subsequent administration of
the government's requirements on par-
ticular contracts.
III. Technical Committees oj the Air-
era jt Industry's Trade Associa-
tion.
The aircraft industry maintains an
active technical liaison with the work of
the Air Services and other agencies of
the Federal Government interested in
aeronautics through the activities of
two main technical committees of the
Aeronautical Chamber of Commerce.
(Continued from page 17)
These are the Airplane Technical Com-
mittee and the Engine Technical Com-
mittee. These bodies are made up of
the engineering executives of the trade
associations' airplane and engine mem-
ber companies.
The Airplane Technical Committee's
program covers several important fields
of work. The main committees' inter-
ests are represented by a steering com-
mittee, members of which are known
to be prime contractors to the Air
Force of Bureau of Aeronautics, Navy.
This program, which has been devel-
oped and adapted to match the opera-
tions of the air agencies of the Federal
Government, is projected by means of
sub-committee activities operating via
correspondence and meetings.
These sub-committees may be tem-
porary or semi - permanent, depending
on the subject being studied. They
consist, of course, of engineering spe-
cialists who are employed by and are
chosen to represent and speak for the
firms participating.
The limits of this article will not
permit a detailed account of the work
of all the groups mentioned above. It
can be shown, however, that this or-
ganziation of airplane company engi-
neering executives and specialists and
the co-ordinated programs undertaken
provide industry and government with
a means for giving each problem en-
countered full technical treatment.
There are industrial problems which
require the attention of both airplane
and engine company engineering spe-
cialists. For example, the design of a
satisfactory airplane powerplant instal-
lation requires considerable teamwork
to achieve the results desired. In such
cases the Airplane and Engine Tech-
nical Committees operate jointly to
explore the difficulties and determine a
solution. The interested government
technicians are consulted and they co-
operate, resulting in a strong customer-
producer relationship.
IV. National Aircraft Standards Com-
mittee.
The National Aircraft Standards
Committee is the industrial body estab-
lished by airplane manufacturers and
officially designated by them as their
representative on matters of standardi-
zation. This standards committee func-

terests of the trade associations' Air-
plane Technical Committee. Person-

BILLETS TO BULLETS FASTER!
BY reducing billets to slugs faster,
this recently perfected Airco ma-
chine gas cutting application speeds
shell production. The Airco cutting
torches — as many as ten can be
mounted in this new Billet Nicking Ma-
chine— make simultaneous cuts a frac-
tion of an inch into a billet, at a speed
of from 20" to 30" per minute. After
nicking, a sudden blow produces a
clean break.
This new Airco developed cutting
application reflects the ability of Air
Reduction's Research and Develop-
ment Engineers to quickly fulfill new
industrial needs. Thus, Air Reduction
customers are first to benefit from many
oxyacetylene applications now speed-
ing war production.
Even as they have revolutionized all-
out war production, so in the peace to
come these processes will show the
way to better products, machines and
structures at less cost.
To better acquaint you with the
many things that this modern produc-
tion tool does better we have published

ready been profitably applied in some
phases of structural engineering. It can

ods could reap full advantage of sav-
ings in materials.
It is said that any builder can pro-
vide strong structures, but that it is
the function of the engineer to design
them strong, light and cheap enough to
be economically justifiable. Now, with
the Theory of Limit Design, the prob-
lem can be approached rationally.

man, NASC, in Washington.
Twenty-five airplane companies take
an active part in NASC work. The
principal tasks of the committee are
handled by standards engineers and
certain other engineering specialists
employed by the participating compa-
nies. These men are called NASC rep-
resentatives.
NASC is officially recognized by the
agencies of the government specializing
in aeronautics for standardization work
on all parts manufactured in the air-
plane manufacturer's plant and all de-
sign specifications directly affecting the
airframe.
There is a continuous flow of work
between the government's working
Committee of the Aeronautical Board
and NASC. The government obtains
the aircraft industry's comments on
proposed new or revised specifications
and standards, dealing with subjects
within the scope of NASC's program,
via this industrial standards body.
Recommended changes in currently ef-
fective AN specifications developed by
the Working Committee of the Aero-
nautical Board and criticisms of the
(Continued from page 26)
specifications of the Air Force and Bu-
reau of Aeronautics are co-ordinated
and presented for consideration by
government, by the standards commit-
tee via its Washington office.
Over one hundred "National Aircraft
Standards" have been issued. As a mat-

ter of policy, when the subjects covered
by these NAS vellums become a part
of the official AN series specifications
or standards, the NAS issued is can-
celled. This ensures against duplica-
tion and avoids confusion in the en-
gineering departments of both govern-
ment and industry.
NASC is presently engaged, among
other work, in reducing the number of
materials, alloys, sizes and shapes used
in current production or specified for
new or revised designs. This work
is labeled "Dimensional Standardiza-
tion" and has resulted in substantial
increases in the productive capacity of
the mills and furnaces turning out war
materials. Such standards work is con-
ducted along lines defined by the
Working Committee of the Aeronauti-
cal Board and in co-operation with the
interested WPB officials. Airplane and
engine manufacturers deserve credit
for their unselfish and unstinted work
to perfect the standardization program
set up by the government.
The foregoing does not contain many
references to collaboration with the civ-
il aviation agencies. The design and
production of war materials command
everyone's full interest at the present
time. We look forward to the future
when a corresponding concentration of
effort by industry and government will
again produce advanced types of air-
craft for civil and commercial purposes.
At that time the industry will expect
to resume its liaison and active co-oper-
ation with the civil aviation authoriies.
ACID CONTROL OF OIL FLOW
(Continued from page 75)
tion experience. However, the basic
principles involved are comparatively
simple and combine practical engineer-
ing with common sense.
In Figure 1 is shown a very simple
schematic diagram of a well with the
casing set at the top of the producing
section and the oil bearing limestone
horizon below. It shows the tubing
inside the casing with perforations set
opposite the lower part of the produc-
ing section. Perhaps this is a new well
in which the pores and channels are
so small that no appreciable flow of oil
will come into the well. Or it is an old
well that has been produced for a long
time until all the oil that can come
into the well under the existing pres-
sure and friction conditions has already
been produced and the flow has de-
creased to such an amount that it is
now uncommercial.
Under either condition, if a solution
of acid were simply dumped into the
well, it would fill up the hole, and rise
into the casing as shown in Figure 3.
The only action of the acid would be
on the face of the rock exposed to the
hole. Such a treatment would enlarge
the bore hole itself, but would have no
effect whatsoever on the small pores
and channels existing back in the rock.
Obviously, some method had to be
devised whereby the acid could be forc-
ed far back into the rock itself, and
there be allowed to react in the pores
and channels, enlarging them and per-
mitting a greater flow of oil.
This was accomplished by what is
known as the "Carr" method of treat-
ment, developed in 1932. The well is
first filled as is shown in Figure 2. This
is done by pumping oil down the tub-
ing and allowing it to rise in the hole
until it comes out at the top of the
casing. Next, acid is introduced into
the tubing and is pumped in until it
completely fills the tubing and has ris-
en from the bottom of the hole to a
point opposite the top of the limestone-
producing formation, as shown in Fig-
ure 2.
In the next step, the valve on the
casinghead is closed. Now, if more
acid is pumped into the tubing, the
acid cannot rise in the hole due to the
column of oil extending from the sur-
face down to the top of the producing
formation. Therefore, the acid must
either go down or go out horizontally.
Due to the greater amount of surface
exposed, the acid will go out horizon-
tally as shown in Figure 2, and this is
continued until all of the acid has been
pumped into the top of the tubing. I
However, the acid left in the tubing is
of no value there, so a sufficient volume
of oil is pumped into the tubing to push
all of the acid out of the tubing and
out of the bottom of the hole. Figure
2 shows the well full of oil again and
the acid out in the formation.
Now the acid is allowed to stay in
the pores until the reaction is complet-
ed. The well is then put on production
by flowing, swabbing or pumping. The
chemical products of the reaction are
produced from the well and thrown
away. Then the oil and gas are able
to come in more freely and the well i»
produced as usual but at an increased
rate of flow.

MAKING ONE-PIECE SUITS FOR SHIPS!
THERE'S NEWS on America's ship ways today ... an
amazing machine that unites steel plates without noise,
fuss, sparks or visible arc! A process that is helping to
construct those marvels of speed, strength, safety, and
carrying capacity . . . "all-welded" ships!
This process . . . known as "Unionmelt" Welding . . . joins
steel plates of any commercial thickness as much as 20 limes
faster than any other similarly applicable method! And it pro-
duces uniformly high-quality welds!
How does it work? A special welding composition . . .
"Unionmelt" . . . flows from a hopper and blankets the edges to
be joined. Within this granulated mixture, intense concentrated
heat is generated by electric current. A bare metal electrode and
the edges being welded are melted and fused. Some of the
"Unionmelt" melts and remains as a temporary protective coating
over the weld.
The process is completely automatic. Special apparatus feeds
the "Unionmelt," the welding rod, and the electric current. Speed
and current values are adjusted by an operator.
"Unionmelt" welding is also speeding up the construction of
fighting tanks and chemical tanks . . . artillery mounts and air-
craft parts . . . pressure vessels and locomotive boilers . . . pipe
and pipe lines . . . and all kinds of heavy mechanical equipment.
Working with this unique process is an astoundingly fast Linde
method of preparing steel plates for welding. White-hot oxy-
acetylenc flames . . . cutting simultaneously at different angles . . .
bevel and square-up steel plates as fast as they are needed!
Together, these two processes are speeding up the fabrication
of key equipment at a remarkable rate.
Many years of research into welding, flame-cutting, flame-
fabricating, and flame-conditioning of metals have given Linde
engineers a vast store of useful knowledge about these methods.
Have you a war production problem which might be solved by
this "know how"?
The important advances in the cutting, conditioning and fabri-
cation of metals made by The Linde Air Products Company have
been facilitated by collaboration with Union Carbide and Carbon
Research Laboratories, Inc., and by the metallurgical experience
of Electro Metallurgical Company— which companies also are
Units of Union Carbide and Carbon Corporation.

THE FACULTY CAN HELP TOO!
NOT many weeks ago a Dean at
the University of Nebraska
called a mass meeting of the students
to enlist them into a service for which
he saw the need. The wheat crop
in the state would have gone to waste
if the diminishing supply of farm
labor had not been supplanted by
some group. He declared a two-
week reprieve from classes and the
students went out to help America's
total war effort by saving the crop.
Men and women at the University
of Michigan have not been idle.
Students have been daily lowering
the local waste in apple, and sugar-
beet crops; men and women students
alike have been working at the Uni-
versity Hospital as orderlies, run-
ners, and clerks; scrap drive and
scrap salvage programs have set a
goal of 400 tons of metal to be
gathered; and now, first-aid and air-
raid classes, and active cooperation
with the Ann Arbor O.C.D. are some
of the more specific plans for the
winter. Until now, participation has
been fostered only by the students'
willingness to cooperate in some ac-
tivity which actually shows accom-
plishment for Michigan's war pro-
gram. Great impetus could be added
to the Manpower Mobilization Corps"
activity, under student Marv Bor-
man's direction, if the faculty and ad-
ministrators of the University would
openly express approval of the or-
ganization and show appreciation of
the fact that students are now doing
more for their country and school
than the requirements of their cur-
ricular activities. Yes, the faculty
have shaken their heads in approval;
we want them to shake their pens
and voices into position for actual,
active approval.
Why cannot we take example, not
necessarily of the process, but at
least the principle demonstrated at
Nebraska? We have the men, the
desire to work, the scap, and the
organization. Faculty men, it is
your job to give us maximum efficien-
cy by that added boost to dispel our
doubt concerning your attitude.

Labor, particularly inexperienced labor, cannot be
expected to recognize the full penalties of careless-
ness in the shop. Management has assumed the re-
sponsibility of supervising safety measures, and has
cooperated in establishing sound safety rules.
Nevertheless, the large increase in labor personnel
due to war needs, plus the influx of inexperienced
men. have resulted in a substantial increase in lost
time accidents.
Even assuming that the obvious safety measures
with regard to operating machinery, electrical equip-
the National Safety Council
ment and shop traffic have been installed, two fac-
tors — education and eternal vigilance — determine
the real effectiveness of any safety program.
Both are the responsibility of the supervisory staff,
from foremen up. The foreman who does a thorough
job of educating his particular group in safety rules
and cooperative enforcement has done much to cut
down accidents. Management that takes an active
interest in both safety education and the enforcement
of safety measures has taken a great step forward in
reducing wastage of irreplaceable production time.

. . . Many of the deaths and injuries
resulting from slippery floors will be
eliminated in the future with the use
of mineral emery flooring. Instead of
using sand and stone as aggregate,
scientifically graded mineral emery,
which is rated next to diamond in hard-
ness, is used. The mineral emery is
mixed with Portland cement and water.
This mixture is applied over the con-
crete flooring as a topping surface.
Tests have shown that this floor pro-
vides a firm, non-slip, gripping surface
when wet. Mineral emery flooring,
unlike most materials, improves with
use, because the concrete wears away
leaving the hard particles of emery
exposed. This type of flooring is also
stronger than concrete flooring. A
standard specimen of mineral emery
aggregate will support 14,000 pounds,
while a similar concrete specimen will
support only 6,200 pounds.
... One of the largest forging hammers
in existence is being used by a Canadian
airplane factory to forge air screw blades
from light alloy stock. This hammer is
a 30,000 pound drop forge affair. The
anvil, which weighs 200 tons, is sup-
ported on two 100 ton blocks which
are cushioned on bed rock 20 feet
underground.
. . . Recently a resident of Long Island
was found lying on the floor of his
bedroom fully clothed with a metal
electrode tied to his neck with a scarf.
On the dead man's chest was a handle
of a "violet ray" machine and in his
left hand was a circular, hollow piece of
metal. With this weird contraption the
deceased had hoped to treat a back
pain. His one mistake was the belief
that "grounding" would increase the
strength of the current and thus speed
up the treatment. No matter how hard
he tried, he could not have devised a
better way to conduct the alternating
current from the ground through the
heart area. Hence, his death was in-
stantaneous.
. . . Freezing machine parts has been
perfected and is now being used. Pre-
viously, if a collar was to be fitted
tightly on a shaft, the collar would be
heated. On cooling, it would shrink
and remain secure. In constructing
accurate machines this was no longer
possible, because heat would injure cost-
ly bearings. So, instead of heating the
collar, the shaft was chilled and a tight
fit was made. The bearing remained
intact.
... For centuries silver has been con-
sidered a precious metal. However, it
is no longer on the inactive list, for it
has been brought into service to replace
tin, a metal which can no longer be
obtained. American engineers, undaunt-
ed by the loss of tin, are manifesting
their ingenuity by replacing tin with a
solder having about 2]/i per cent silver
and 97J-2 per cent lead. Silver is also
being used in brazing joints. It has
been known for some time that silver
would give a stronger joint, but few
men used it because of its cost.
... American fighter pilots carry their
12 pound boat in a compact 14 by IS
by 4 inch seat pack. When inflated,
the boat is 5 feet 6 inches long by 3
feet 4 inches wide. Included in this
pack are two wire-reinforced fabric
paddles and one air pump as part of
the equipment. It also has plugs which
can be used to stop up the bullet holes
received. For a bailer, a thin col-
lapsible fabric cup is used, and, finally,
it has a fabric sea anchor. All this
equipment goes to our fighter pilots to
increase the odds in their favor.
... "Strain aging" of steel structures
which are subject to repeated stress
has always been a major nuisance to
designers. Recently, it was announced
that a new manufacturing process pro-
duces steel with negligible aging char-
acteristics. It has long been known
that nitrogen in steel is the cause of
aging. The new process limits the
nitrogen content to two thousandths of
one per cent by annealing in an at-
mosphere of hydrogen. It is claimed
that the steel thus produced has an
increased tensile strength of ten thou-
sand pounds per square inch.

is similar to the common range finder.
This stereoptician type instrument ac-
curately measures the distance to an
approaching plane, relays the readings
to its mechanical brain, and aims the

... An Eastern shipyard is replacing one
hundred pound solid rubber tires on
its yard trailers which are used to
transport twenty ton propellers. Hard
maple wood retreads are soaked in lin-
seed oil for twenty-four hours and then
applied.
... A new 200 watt floodlight is unique
in that the socket-housing and reflector
are die-formed in one piece. The light
which is made entirely of steel is oper-
ated by means of a two-jointed shaft
upon which the unit rests.
. . . Another development in floodlight
illumination is a lamp particularly
adapted to combustible areas. It has
successfully been used in such places as
powder igloos, powder magazines, ware-
house interiors containing combustible
material, and during many emergencies
such as blackouts. The unit is contained
within a small steel box equipped with
a dust- and vapor-proof lamp housing to
facilitate pointing in all directions. A
storage battery with non-spill valves is
an important feature of this lamp and
provision has been made for exchanging
discharged batteries with charged ones
by means of a polarized connector per-
manently wired to the battery terminals.
... The most common method of traffic
light operation during blackouts has, up
to this time, consisted in cutting down
lens areas, thus reducing illumination
and increasing traffic hazards. However,
a new dim-out signal has been devised
whereby total lens area is utilized but
the resulting light is indiscernible from
the air.
... Believed to be the smallest of its
type in existence, a new switch designed
especially for use in aircraft applications
weighs only 9 grams. Its great utility
arises from applications where space is
limited and vibration conditions are se-
vere. It is versatile in that it can be
operated by any one of a number of
methods and is arranged for various
types of operation.
... Because airplane engines must be
ready for service immediately after they
leave the assembly line, they are given a
break-in run by their manufacturers be-
fore installation. If allowed to run free,

the motors would blow up so standard
practice has been tt&gt; attach a propeller
during break-in runs. This type of load-
ing, however, has been replaced by sub-
stituting generators for the propellers,
thus eliminating test cells and deriving
an important source of power from the
expenditure of test fuel. One leading
manufacturer has installed 16 generators
which develop 4,000,000 kwh per month,
equivalent to $24,000 at current rates.
An added advantage of this break-in
system is the check on each engine's per-
formance through observation of power
output. The generators also serve as
starting motors for the stiff engines.
... Three more of the world's largest
generators are now being constructed to
augment the power output of the six
generators now in use at Grand Coulee.
Eventually eighteen such generators will
be installed, each producing 108,000 kw.
Transportation for these 1,000 ton
giants—45 feet in diameter and 24 feet
high—is provided by 38 freight cars.
This mammoth power source—the larg-
est in the world—is now used to supply
energy for Pacific coast aluminum plants,
but after the war the energy will be
used to irrigate 1,200,000 acres of semi-
arid land east of the Cascade Moun-
tains.

cernible during blackouts are similarly
treated. The absence of glare and the
low reflective quality offers no aid in de-
tection from the air.
... The job of examining large steel cast-
ings for defects formerly required several
hours, but can now be done in less than
two minutes. The reason: a newly de-
veloped X-ray tube—the largest in the
world—which can take pictures through
four inches of steel in less time than it
takes to tell about it. The tube is rated
at 1,000,000 volts.
... An induction electron accelerator
has been developed which is capable of
imparting to electrons as much as 20,-
000,000 volts. Consisting of a dough-
nut shaped vacuum tube and a magnet
with one pole above and one below the
tube. The electrons are accelerated
within the tube receiving a push of as
much as 70 volts per revolution. Speeds
of 400,000 revolutions per l/720th of a
second .have been attained which is
equivalent to 185,000 miles per second.
... Light from an 800,000,000 candle-
power mobile antiaircraft searchlight is
so bright that a newspaper can easily be
read at night in an airplane at a distance
of twelve miles from the source.
... During the past few years the auto-
mobile mortality rate has been approxi-
mately double that of humans. The
number of car "graveyards" at the be-
ginning of 1942 was 20,393, over twice
the number of large cemeteries. It is
estimated that 2,300,000 were retired
from service at the end of 1941. Auto-
mobiles also had the edge on humans in
birth rate. From 1939 to 1941 the aver-
age birth rate of cars was over 8,000,000,
almost twice that of humans.
. .. Ideas are already sweeping the coun-
try on how to salvage sunken ships. One
ingenious individual has devised a sys-
tem by which he proposes to use tongs
to raise the sunken hulls. The dry docks
to carry thirty powerful hoisting ma-
chines would be 520 feet long and 210
feet wide. This dry dock would be
sailed to the sunken ship and the tongs
would be wrapped around the hull. The
ship would then be hoisted through a

Cost of this device is estimated at less
than the price of one large freighter.
... Investigation has shown that storage
batteries lose very little energy at the
freezing point of water. At 70° F. the
normal car battery loses 1% of its
charge per day. At 100° the rate of dis-
sipation is three times as great. In this
investigation it was found that the com-
position of the battery plates as- well as
the temperature influences the rate of
discharge. A battery with pure lead
plates would lose about 15% of its

of movie-goers, shoppers, and office
workers is rapidly finding its place in

necessary to perform the necessary oper-

new product is produced by firing ordin-
ary glass which has been mixed with a
small quantity of pure carbon. At a pre-
determined temperature the glass melts
and the carbon, which forms a gas, re-
acts with the molten glass in the same
manner that yeast acts upon bread. By
controlling the temperature, time,
amount of carbon, and batch of glass it
is possible to produce rigid vitraeous

control the size of spray and thus help
determine the engine efficiency—the
smaller the hole, the finer the spray,
and hence the more complete oil com-
bustion.
To test these nozzles, one manufac-
turer mounted on a circular ring test

tion, but it was during King Solomon's
time that there was recorded the first
attempt to create celestial and terrestrial
globes. The biblical record says that
Hiram of Tyre, one of King Solomon's
engineers . . . today's engineers are not
employed by kings . . . erected before
Solomon's temple two pillars. On the
top of one was a globe showing the map
of the starry heavens and on the other
the glebe outlined the then known world.

bia showed skeptics that the earth was

was made by Martin Behaim of Nurem-
berg, in the same year that Columbus
discovered America. Its parchment
cover located over 1,000 places and was
decorated by miniature flags and fishes.
Today's globes are made by two
methods. In one the globe is made in
halves by hot pressing the heavy card-
board shell with the printed map. These
half-worlds are then joined together at
the equator. The other method is to
form a perfect smooth sphere . . . today
plaster of Paris and glass are vsed . . .
and then the map segments are hand
mounted with paste.
Did you ever try to smooth a flat
piece of paper to a ball? It's not easy.
This stage of the construction is not
simple for the globe maker either. The
world map is first printed on a flat
piece of paper, the map looking like
segments of orange peel. These are
called gores and are die cut along the
meridian lines, those places that when
connected on the sphere are the least
likely to disturb the printing of names
and places on the map. The last opera-
tion before mounting is lacquering,
which preserves the surface and permits
it to be washed.

ALICE C. COFF, *15E
IT is a curious anomaly that war,
which women have always bitterly
denounced, has forced the professional
advancement of women in engineering
and applied science. Prior to the first
World War, a few women pioneered
in such professions. But it was during
that Great War, when men were not
available, that the services of women
engineers were in great demand. They
were drawn into tool design and into
chemical research. They worked at
gauging in torpedo plants. They de-
signed buildings and automobiles. Great
numbers of positions were open to
women to carry on professional work
formerly done by men.
After the first Wrorld War had
brought these women into prominence
and they had demonstrated their ability,
other women became interested in these
professions. As a result, increasing
numbers have matriculated in engineer-
ing colleges and institutes of technology.
Many women have received their bach-
elor's degrees in their chosen subjects;
some have gone on to earn their mas-
ter's degrees; a number possess doc-
torates.
In 1937 the writer made a survey of
women in engineering and architectural
professions and in related fields. This
was accomplished through the records
of universities, registration bureaus,
and engineering societies. The result
was the accumulation of approximately
one thousand names of women who had
received college training in engineering
or some allied subject. Many of these
women were not active in their profes-
sions. Some were students, who had
not completed their formal education.
Others had finished their schooling,
but had made no use of their tech-
nical training. A few had retired from
active life after years of work. The
purpose of their survey was to start
a newspaper, of which the author was
editor for several years.
The second World War furnished
fresh impetus for women to rush into
technical work. They flocked to jobs
vacated by men called into active
service. Their training had to be con-
centrated into much shorter periods
than ordinarily would be required. But
greater contributions to the war effort
have been made by women who had
acquired their technical educations
earlier, so that they have had oppor-

Alice C. Goff
tunity to develop experience and good
judgment. In order to gain a com-
prehensive picture of the work done by
such women, one must consider indivi-
duals in various lines of engineering.
For example, Mrs. Edith Meyer is
a metallurgical engineer who received
the degree of bachelor of science in
metallurgical engineering from Mas-
sachusetts Institute of Technology and
the degree of master of science in met-
allurgical engineering from the Case
School of Applied Science. This was
the only degree ever awarded to a
woman by the latter school.
She did pioneering X-ray work on
metals in the laboratory of the Cleve-
land Wire Works of General Electric
Company. In connection with this re-
search work, she published distinguished
papers on tungsten and iron tungsten
alloys.
Since her marriage, she and her hus-
band, Mr. Andrew Meyer, a well-known
mining engineer, have done interesting
work in Colombia, South America, in
Spain, in Russia, and in the wilds of
Quebec, Canada. More gold metal has
passed through her hands than those
of any other woman in the world, with
the possible exception of the woman
director of the United States mint. Gold
was recovered in large quantities by
her when she had charge of technical
control work on a polymetal mill and
lead smelter for the Soviet government
in Kazakstan, Central Asia. This plant,
which she developed and equipped for
smelting lead, with precious metals as
a byproduct, resulted in one of the
most efficient operations of this nature
in the world. This project was far
removed from the X-ray and high
powered microscopes of the laboratory,
where materials were measured in
grams. Here she dealt with concen-
trates in thousands of tons. Mr. Meyer
had charge of the polymetal mines in
the Altai mountains straddling the
Mongolia border of the Soviet Union.
These mines are among the richest in
the world. They fed the ore into the
mill, which in turn fed the concen-
trates to the smelter. Mr. Meyer su-
pervised all the mining operations; Mrs.
Meyer had charge of metallurgical
practices.
Now that they are located in Cleve-
land again, Mrs. Meyer is metallurgist
for the Brush Laboratories Company.
In 1940 she was placed in charge of
research and development work on
beryllium oxide as a ceramic and re-
fractory. An outstanding property of
the product is its ability to withstand
extremely high temperatures without
breaking down or without entering into
combination with other materials. At
the present time, research and develop-
ment are in crucial abatement for ur-
gent demands for the material by the
Office of Scientific Research and De-
velopment. Now she is intensively en-
gaged on bringing beryllium oxide into

INDUSTRIES
By
PAULS. KENNEDY, '44E
WHEN Sir Humphrey Davy, Vol-
ta, Nicholson and Carlisle per-
formed their simple laboratory experi-
ments involving an electric current and
its reaction on chemical solutions at
the beginning of the nineteenth century,
they probably did not realize they were
sireing $400,000,000 worth of essential
industries. However, we need only go
back a little oyer 100 years to the
development of electroplating by the
Elkingtons in England to find the be-
ginning of the commercial development
of the electrochemical industries.
These industries may be roughly
divided into three groups: (1) The
electrolytic industries in which an
aqueous soltion of ions is usually in-
volved; (2) The fused electrolyte
group; (3) the electrothermal group.
Probably the most common of all
electro-chemical industries is the first
group, the electrolytic group, of which
electroplating is the best example. Fun-
damentally, the metal to be deposited is
disolved from an anode of the material
immersed in a solution of its ions which
are deposited on the object being plated
as the cathode, or an insoluble anode
may be used, the metal being plated
from the dissolved salt in the plating
bath. The actual plating, however, can
be done only after the object has been
thoroughly freed of rust, tarnish, oxides,
grease, oil, and dirt by various cleaning
and pickling solutions, or by electro-
lytic cleaning with an electrolyte of
fairly high alkali content.
At the present time, almost every
metal of commercial importance may be
plated electrolytically, including some
alloys, mainly brass. Electroplating
need not be limited to only covering
some object for the purposes of pro-
tection or decoration, for seamless iron
and copper tubing has been made by
depositing the metal on a rotating man-
drel and then slipping the tube from
the mandrel or, if a lead mandrel is
used, melting it out. Very thin sheets
of copper have also been formed by
electro-deposition of copper on a drum
cathode rotating in the electrolyte, the
sheets being peeled off as one would peel
an apple.
Electroplating is by no means th(
only industry included in this group.
Electrorefining of metals is another in-
dustry depending upon the flow of cur-
rent through electrolytes.
and tellurium used in this country are
usually found associated with the cop-
per and lead ores and are recovered in
the slime deposit at the bottom of ihe
cell, concentrated and purified, and
finally electrolytically deposited as the
pure metals. About 75$ of the total
silver production of the world is recov-
ered as a by-product of copper and lead
refining.
Most attempts at refining lead elec-
trolytically have failed or have not
reached a commercial stage with the
exception of the Betts process, in which,
as in copper, impure lead is used as
the anode and lead sheets as the
cathode. And unusually pure lead
(99.9999;) may be obtained this way.
Electrolytic tin is not now produced
on a large scale, the bulk of the ore
from Bolivia (before the war) going
to England for blending with higher
grade ores from the Far East. The
electrolytic refining of tin was devel-
oped by the United States during World
War I to deal with the complex or
impure Bolivian ores, and may be again
in use.
Electrolytic iron has not been made

more electropositive than copper and
nickel and practically all of the selenium
in appreciable commercial amounts, al-
though it has many useful properties
and more extensive use may be made
of it in the future. By varying the
(ferrous hydrogen) ion ratio, it is
possible to obtain deposited iron of
very different properties. For example.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


TOOLING ENGINEER
By
R. C. FREEMAN, '21 E
'THE mechanical engineer was once
■*■ simply a man professionally asso-
ciated with the design, construction, or
operation of simple power-driven me-
chanical devices. In days when ma-
chines were few and simply construct-
ed, the mental capacity of a mechan-
ically minded man was not strained to
encompass the structural and opera-
tional principles of such devices. But
as certain lines of machines found spe-
cialized development in trades and
processes, because they proved to be
more certain than other designs in
producing desirable results, the me-
chanical engineer became involved in
the evolutionary process of increasing
detail. A man could no longer be
expected to spend years engrossed, for
instance, with competitive textile ma-
chinery improvements, and at the same
time keep up with the refinement de-
tails of transportation machines. Even
if he could, it was generally unprofit-
able to do so; specialization, the scrut-
iny and further breakdown of ap-
pertinent detail of his own machines
brought higher rewards from society.
Thus a mechanical engineer is now a
man who in cooperation with other
engineers is responsible for only a few
components looming large to him in
their mass of correlative detail, as
did the whole structural project to his
forerunner.
This evolutionary process is recog-
nized in all pursuits of professional
standing. In manufacturing especially
do the duties of an organization's en-
gineers evince functional diversity. This
is not so necessarily true for small
proprietory establishments: but in the
gargantuan, highly rationalized plants
of the mass production industries, it
is not only true, but for continued
improvement of the product, and of
its manufacturing processes, it emerges
as a categorical imperative.
On the professional staff of a plant
manager, therefore, will be found all
sorts of engineering specialists. Even
if a complete corps of such specialists
cannot be supported by the plant bud-
get, they are found to be on call from
innumerable servicing, machine tool,
consulting or sales engineering con-
cerns. Specialists are a necessity for
insuring the economic status of an or-
ganization in the competitive field.
The engineering design staff of a
manufacturing plant may well be sep-
petition, there is no one who can point
out which is of more importance to
the success of the firm.
Tool engineers themselves are of two
sorts: those who design, make and sell
machine tools and supplies; and those
who use the machine tools and supplies
to manufacture other products. The
first, the sales engineering representa-
tives, are almost a part of their cus-
tomers' staffs. They diagnose his needs
and offer their machine-tool proposals
to cover those needs. But the wise
customer calls on other concerns for
proposals to cover the same job since
expenditure of millions of dollars are
frequently involved. Confronted with
this situation, a manufacturer takes
steps to have his own tool engineers
pass competent judgment on such
problems.
The tool engineer who has the re-
sponsibility of recommending purchase
of processing equipment must also be
responsible for the plans to process
the product. This calls for a wide
variety of specific considerations that
bear very intimately on the success
of the entire manufacturing project.

arated into two categories. First ap-
pears the product engineer—the man
who controls the detailed designing of
the product. His function is to design
something to make the proprietor
money. Then come the tool or process
engineer. He determines how the
product is to be tooled and processed.
His function is to design to save the
proprietor money. Since each class
thrives in its own field of intense com-
Once the plans are made, the machine
tooling lineups established, and the
processing under way, the function of
the tooling engineer has only begun.
Inasmuch as the manufacturing process
is a continuing one, so is his function
as a productive tool engineer. For
with the actual beginning of the ma-
chining, he becomes the watch-dog for
engineering disturbances to his care-

Although alternate current has large-
ly replaced the older direct current in
household and commercial application
direct current electricity will always hold
an important position in the electro-
lytic refining industries.
Convincing evidence of the enormous
quantities of D. C. electricity which
must be produced are two transformers
recently installed by one utility com-
pany to provide the wartime demands
of aluminum plants.
These new units are each as large
as a six-room house and weigh 257 tons.
It is their job to step up transmis-
sion voltage from 27,000 to 132,000
volts. This particular transformation
is calculated to give the most efficient
operation under given conditions.
Into these giants has gone 100 tons
of structural steel, 111 tons of improved
iron core, 130 miles of copper wire
weighing 29 tons, and 44,000 gallons

of oil for insulation and cooling pur-
poses. When all the items from the
parts list were assembled, the resulting
monsters were each 25 feet high, 39
feet long, and 24 feet wide. To trans-
port the transformers to their new
home, 6 freight cars for each unit and
8 tank cars for the oil were required.
Staggering though these figures may

be, they might have well been much
larger had it not been for a newly
developed core metal. The new iron
has a greater flux capacity over that
normally obtainable. Consequently, the
iron content of the units was greatly
reduced, the over-all dimensions of the
core body were smaller, larger savings
were made in copper winding, the outer
tank dimensions were considerably re-
duced, and the demand for cooling and
insulating oil was cut down. All in
all, the net saving due to the new-
magnetic core amounted to 40 tons of
steel, 4 tons of copper, and 4,000 gal-
lons of oil.
gas tank
To facilitate high pressure storage
in the Omaha, Nebraska gas distributor
system the operating utility company-
has erected a large sphere, picturesque
in appearance, and excellent in utility.
To the distant passer-by the great
sphere might tempt the imagination
with thoughts of Martian meddling;
but to the technician who designed and
constructed it, it's just a gas tank built
to serve a purpose.
The Omaha distributing system con-
sists of 488 miles of 3 inch to 24 inch
distributor mains, 35 miles of 6 inch
to 24 inch transmission mains, and
three additional low pressure gas hold-
ers. Serving 5700 consumers, the sys-
tem has been known to distribute
16,300,000 cubic feet of gas in a single
day.
The sphere, itself, is completely butt
welded, operating at pressures up to
64 pounds per square inch. It is 52
feet in diameter and is filled by a manu-
ally-operated compressor unit driven by
a gas engine. A pressure of 5 or 6
inches of water is maintained in the
distributor system by means of district
regulators. (Cut by Chicago B &amp; I Co.I


are: (1) furnaces must be considerably
larger than the induction coils, (2) no
rolls are necessary which might scratch
or mar the sheets, (3) generated heat
can easily be adjusted in the coils when
the speed is cut down to facilitate weld-
ing other strips of material to the con-
tinuous sheet. (4) the high frequency
unit can be put directly into the tinning
line, assembly-line fashion, without
having to reduce the over-all speed.
But important as these advantages
may be, without them the electrolytic
process would still be an important
development. The reason: a saving of
nearly 70f/r of the total amount of tin
used in the plating industry can be
realized as compared to its consumption
in the dipping process.

high frequency finishing
Long known to be a slow, expensive,
and wasteful process for the production
of tin plate, the dipping process was
replaced by an electrolytic method of
tinning. As a consequence of this, a
new finishing method has recently been
developed which is rapidly replacing
other finishing operations.
The rough electrolytically tinned
sheet steel is pased through coils which
emit radio waves—200,000 cycles per
second—this setting up counter cur-
rents at the surface which melt down
the peaks and fill up the valleys.
The underlying theory of the process
is that the waves tear electrons from
the tin atoms which, driven by the
current, smash into other atoms trans-
forming their kinetic energy into heat.
In the near future, speeds of 1000
feet per minute are expected of the
electrolytic plating mills and it is said
that induction finishing process can
easily match the speed. In comparison,
gas furnaces can operate at only 150
feet per minute and the hot oil treat-
ment is slower than 50 feet per minute.
Other advantages of the new process
When steam was first used for ship
propulsion, reciprocating engines were
used with paddle wheels on the sides of
the ship. The engines were directly con-
nected to the paddle-wheel shaft and
the wheels were as large as thirty feet in
diameter.
The next stage in development was
the propeller. Again the power was
transmitted directly to the propeller, the
crankshaft turning at the same speed as
the propeller itself. Reciprocating en-
gines ware still used and had been im-
proved to the multi-stage engine with
increasing power and efficiency. The
speed of these engines was still slow
enough to permit direct coupling.
With the advent of the high-speed

DON O'NEILL, '43E
The greatest problem facing the
United States other than that of
actually fighting the war is that of con-
verting quickly and efficiently all pos-
sible industries over to war production.
This must be accomplished in the ab-
sence of many seemingly vital materials.
The most notable of these is caoutchouc
or natural rubber.
Formerly, 97% of our crude rubber
was imported from British Malaya, the
Netherlands Indies, Ceylon, and adja-
cent territories in the Far East. Today
our imports from that sector of the
globe have virtually ceased. Unless
the Allies gain control of the seas in
the Far East, we shall be forced to rely
for our subber supply upon three
sources: stock on hand, scrap, and
synthetic substitutes.
The scrap rubber collected during
the recent drive together with the gov-
ernment reserve and the supply on hand
at various private companies will ease
the shortage this year and part of next.
Meanwhile, we must develop our pro-
duction of synthetic substitutes to the
point where we can keep our war ma-
chine on wheels, send our allies about
200,000 tons annually, and have enough
left over for bare civilian needs.
For many years chemists have tried
without success to synthetically dupli-
cate the composition of natural rubber.
This approach to the problem has failed
because, in spite of years of intensive
research, the exact molecular arrange-
ment and the mechanism of the poly-
merization by which isoprene is con-
verted into natural rubber is unknown.
No synthetic polymer of isoprene has
yet been produced which even ap-
proaches the properties of other syn-
thetic rubbers. In more recent attempts
to produce a satisfactory substitute for
rubber, emphasis has been placed on
duplicating the physical properties rath-
er than the chemical structure of the
natural rubber. Three main types of
synthetics have been developed which
approach natural rubber in their prop-
erties. They are: (1) butadiene based
rubbers, (2) Koroseal or polymerized
vinyl chloride types, and (3) Thiokol
types.
At the present time our government
is most interested in the first type—■
the butadiene based rubbers. These
synthetics have been the most thor-
oughly investigated of all the types
developed. For many years the I. G.
Farbenindustrie of Germany has been
investigating and developing the buna
type rubbers. In 1938, the German
army rolled into Austria on tires of
Buna rubber and proved to the world

that a practical synthetic product was
a reality.
Buna-S and Buna-N, the most proven
of the synthetic products, are made by
the copolymerization of butadiene with
styrene or acrylonitrile. Sixty to sev-
enty-five per cent by weight of buna
rubber is butadiene—the remainder be-
ing a comonomer such as styrene or
acrylonitrile. Butadiene is produced
commercially in the United States by
four main methods:
(1) Cracking of petroleum may be
made to yield as high as from 5
to 12% butadiene.
(2) Symmetrical dimethyl ethylene may
be chlorinated and heated with
barium chloride to yield butadiene.
(3) Successive dehydrogenations of bu-
tane at 600 to 650 degrees Centi-
grade over a catalyst of aluminum
and chromic oxides yields buta-
diene.
(4) Acetylene treated with cuprous and
ammonium chloride catalysts fol-
lowed by selective hydrogenation
may be made to yield butadiene.
Another method that will be used
more widely in the future is that of
producing butadiene from farm prod-
ucts. The grain is first subjected to
a fermentation process which yields
ethyl alcohol. The alcohol is dehy-
drated by heating in the presence of
aluminum oxide catalyst and is then
polymerized to butadiene by the use
of a polymerization catalyst.
The coke-limestone-acetylene process
is used by the German producers. How-
ever, in the United States where we
are fortunate enough to have plentiful
supplies of petroleum and farm prod-
ucts, the methods using alcohol and
petroleum wil be found to be less ex-
pensive processes. The production of
styrene and acrylonitrile, the most
commonly used monomers with buta-
diene in the production of buna rub-
bers, can be accomplished to a large
extent by plants already in existence
and will not interfere seriously with
the production of other vital products.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


By
EARL AIKEN
American business, which has been
i»heavily hit by shortages of critical
materials, today is turning more strong-
ly than ever before to the use of new
types of flat glass fashioned to replace
aluminum, teel, and other vital metals
sorely needed for the production of war
weapons. One of the oldest materials
known to man has been adapted
through intensive research accelerated
by the threat of war to uses undreamed
of less than a decade ago.
Since the first glare on the horizon of
the European conflagration was seen
on this side of the Atlantic, new types
of glass and new uses for glass have
been put into rapid production to meet
the demand for materials needed to
replace vital metals, the lack of which
was bringing the spectre of complete
shutdown to the very door of many of
the nation's largest businesses.
One of the major uses of glass to
supplant metal, in both home and in-
dustry, has been successfully accom-
plished by a glass manufacturing com-
pany in the development of a heat
tempered plate glass with unusual re-
sistance to impact shock and sudden
temperature changes. It is from three
to seven times stronger than ordinary
plate glass and can be bent or twisted
and return to its normal plane when
pressure is removed. Tests have shown
that a large sheet of this glass three
quarters of an inch thick suspended
horizontally from its four corners will
bend but support, without breaking or
cracking, the weight of an elephant.
This tempered glass is made by a
special process in which sheets of plate
glass are heated and then suddenly
cooled by jets of air forced upon the
surface of the glass. Rapid cooling of
the two outside surfaces while the inner
portion of the glass is still hot sets
up a molecular change that gives the
glass unusual characteristics.
Another development is an insulating
unit of double or multiple glass panes
sealed around the edges, which is prov-
ing its worth in cabinets for the display
of frozen foods, and is replacing metal
and porcelain in the doors of domestic
refrigerators. This insulating unit, al-
though just coming into wide usage, was
first tested in 1939 by Rear Admiral
Richard Byrd in Little America. It
was used as windows in the roof of
the expedition headquarters under the
snow. With interior temperatures of
75 degrees above zero and exterior
temperatures ranging down to 75 de-
grees below, this glass insulating unit

eliminated condensation and did not
crack under the 150 degree temperature
differential.
The production story of these various
types of glass which are doing their
duty both on the war and home front
is one of amazing contrasts. For ex-
ample, the glass industry has progressed
in its research and accomplishments
faster in the past decade than at any
other single period in its 5,000 year
history. The glass industy was one
of the last to become modernized de-
spite ever increasing production and
larger factories. This was due to the
fact that glas making for many cen-
turies had been in the hands of a small
group of craftsmen who jealously and
violently guarded the secrets of their
art. The history of glass from its in-
ception, long before the time of Christ,
is steeped in murder and violence. So
closely guarded was the secret of glass
making that as late as 1900, in America
its manufacture was essentially the
same as it was in 1600. One of the
earliest advances of the glass making
industry was recorded in 1903 when the
world's first machine for making bottles
was invented. This one invention revo-
lutionized the glass industry, by intro-
ducing machine methods, and paved
the way for gigantic strides in progress

Right up there among our better
known young engineers is Mr. Paul
D.' "Pete', to his friends, WHngate.
With lots on the ball both scholastically
and extracurricularly, Pete has been
honored by not only Tau Beta Pi and
Phi Eta Sigma, but Vulcans and Mich-
igamua have seen fit to have his smiling
countenance about. We don't know
what his fraters over at Zeta Beta Tau
have against him, but Pete seems to
spend the greatest part of his time in
the I.F.C. office. As Secretary-Treas-
urer of the organization, he has done
much to make it a stronger, more

Paul Wingate
efficient body. Through his efforts the
Inter-Fraternity Xewspaper has been
revived, there will be a pledge inter-
fraternity sing, and the I.F.C. is spon-
soring "Victory Vanities," the proceeds
of which will go into the Bomber
Scholarship Fund.
There's a bit of the wanderlust buried
somewhere down inside Pete, 'cause
there's nothing he likes quite so much
as to get behind the wheel of a car
and go. I don't know how he's going
to satisfy his desires in the near future,
though: Uncle Sam and Mr. Jeffers
have something to say about that sort
of thing. However, in the four years
that he's been here he has found the
time to visit a number of our neighbor-
ing campuses, particularly, of course,
during the football season. In follow-
ing the open road, Pete has already
toured most of the nation.
So that his studying does not become
a chore, and in order to maintain some
efficiency, Pete likes to let off a bit of
steam rather regularly. Friday and
Saturday nights, with the books neatly
piled in some hidden corner, are re-
served for social relaxation. No class
dance in four years has gone without
his presence, and he finds the steaks
and beer at the P-Bell delicious.
Like most of us, Pete gets his exercise
almost exclusively down at PEM, but
he also likes to ride and play a little
tennis and baseball occasionally. He
claims that his golf game is too poor
to mention. Who's isn't?
An M.E.-Industrial, Pete's post-war
plans are in the field of administrative
engineering. His services have been
"requested," however, and graduation
will see him with the Air Corps Engi-
neers down at Chanute Field, Illinois.
There he will "Keep 'Em Flying!"

Amiable and easy going, Bob is the
perfect example of what is known as a
"good joe." In his capacity of president.
Bob keeps meetings lively through his
impromptu remarks. He is a positive
genius for saying the wrong thing at
exactly the right time and frequently
brings down the house.
In addition to being president of
Mimes, Bob has been in several of the
Union Operas. He played the part of a
co-ed in "Four Out of Five" and was
charming. The show played Detroit one
night and Bob whipped out between
acts with a few of the "girls"' for a little
refreshment, liquid variety. Before re-
turning to the stage as a demure miss.
Bob had a battle with "some ??! IcejeJ*!
who laughed at the beauties. Last year
he was stage manager, either because of
this or in spite of it!
Bob has been active in intramural
sports, swimming, wrestling, and play-
ing handball. He went out for the

wrestling team as a freshman, but found
his board job of wrestling dishes was
enough work. When he found himself
with three semesters and sixty hours to
go, Bob dropped the job to wrestle with
Ch.E. and Met. courses. According to
Bob one of the Met. courses, the X-Ray
lab, is aiding greatly in solving the rub-
ber shortage. Hush, though—it's a mili-
tary secret!
Last summer Bob attended the sum-
mer term, but worked the two previous
summers for a gas company. Some say
that is where he learned to gas so well.
Actually, however, Bob dug ditches and
swung a pipe wrench earning seme
money and developing a set of muscles.
Since he has enlisted in V-5 Bob will go
into the navy upon graduation, and may
make a career of it. He always has
wanted to see South America and China
. . . and those South Sea Islands that
Dottie Lamour hails from!

If the noise in the SAE house isn't
coming from Ehrlich, it's coming from
his radio. The noisy side of Bob Ehr-
lich "s hobby is not always appreciated,
but his electrical knowledge is. If you
are stuck on some problem, just ask
him and you will get the answer—and
the topic need not be electrical engineer-
ing. Bob has been teaching radio to
a class of Lit students long enough to
have developed the profound profes-
sor's methods of answering any question
that may arise. The title of "Hacker"
was attached in his first EE course for
his free use of the fudge factor and
Skinner's Table of Variable Constants.
W8WJV is Bob's call, as many Ann
Arbor residents knew before Pearl Har-
bor shut down amateur radio. Due to
the construction of many receivers, Bob
would blast WWJ off the air around
Ann Arbor with his 100 watts—until
many bitter telephone conversations
with the local residents forced him to
observe quiet hours until WWJ left the
air at midnight. He then put in his
usual number of operating hours, and
caught up on his sleep in class the
next day. In fact, he developed the
art of sleeping to the point where he
could sleep and still know what the
prof was talking about—kept his eyes
closed and his ears open. Although off
the air for the duration, his desk is still
piled high with various receivers and
amplifiers. To hear superb FM re-
ception, pay him a visit.
Greek is another sidelight of the
Hacker's, as he belongs to Phi Eta
Sigma. Pi Tau Pi Sigma, Tau Beta Pi,
Eta Kappa Nu, and Phi Kappa Phi. He
is vice chairman for the A.I.E.E., and
a captain in the R.O.T.C. If any men
miss drill or PEM, Bob is the one who
wields the axe as regimental adjutant
in charge of keeping the rolls.
A man of many hobbies, Bob spends
time at home reading the signs in New
York, 15 miles away, with a 64 power
6" telescope that he made. His neigh-
bors in Maplewood also come under
close scrutiny. The mirror required 60
hours of grinding, and he claims it is
accurate to a millionth of an inch.
Don't ask him how it was done, for
the story requires about an hour to tell
and takes much hand waving. Pho-
tography is another hobby he spends
time on. taking pictures at dances for
one of the local stores.
Like many others, Bob escaped bore-
dom while attending the summer semes-
ter. When he became interested in the
subject of an EE course, he cut a CE
steadily for over a month to sit in
on the EE. In the company of several
other EE boys he was instrumental in
causing a Milwaukee brewery to add respected
an extra shift. Many EE problems
were done downtown, and Bob still

After thirty-five-and-a-half years of
service as Assistant Secretary of the
Engineering School, Mrs. Camilla Green
has retired. Everyone who knew her is
sorry to see her leave and will miss her
daily presence.
As a girl Mrs. Green lived on the cam-
pus itself in one of the professor's
houses. Leaving Ann Arbor, she went to
Chicago and worked there for 15 years,
returning in 1907 to start work for the
University. The building she was in then
stood where the Clements Library now
is. She has been with the Engineering
College continuously since then, working
under S deans, 4 assistant deans, and 3
secretaries.
Mrs. Green has edited the Announce-
ments for the Engine School, and com-
piled a history of the curriculum since
1895. When the grade system was
started in 1922, all home lists were
placed entirely in her hands. She also
has had the final word on credits and
courses when we come up for gradua-
tion. Thus every student since 1907 has
passed through her hands. Mrs. Green
has also been advisor for the women
engineers ever since the system was
originated. Prof. Spooner is now their
advisor.
At registration time Mrs. Green used
to meet every student as he entered the
University and came to know many of
them personally. Michigan means much
to Mrs. Green. She loves it and "her

Looking over some of the magazines

that. Let's say there was a queenship
for every event.)

Incidentally, we don't believe there
are many men left here who remember
the last beauty contest that was held
—the one that put the flug on all
future beauty contests. Well, chillun,
'twere this way: Michigan was in its
doldrums, four out of five etc., etc.;
but our neighbor the Garg swung with
its chin and had its contest anyway.
When the results were all tabulated,
the winner was found to be Jack Bren-
nan. the pride of the football team.
Runner-up was Eli, the Beta bulldog.
A former Michigan engineer now in
the navy told this one to us and we
are losing no time in pasing it on. It
concerns Uncle Sam's new coast patrol,
which is made up chiefly of yachts con-
verted into subchasers.
The crew of one of these vessels wa±
trained in ths theory of their job, but
this was their first shot at active patrol
duty. Their ship was well equipped
with machine guns, depth charges, sub
detectors, and all the other necessary
paraphernalia. One of the blue-jacket-

It finally turned out that the sound
they heard was their own propellor.

We never realized how efficient is
the campus grapevine until that little
episode of the weekend of the Ohio

far and wide. We have been busy ever
since explaining all about it. Our first
day back in class people whispered all
the way acros the classroom, "How did
you get out of the brig?" People we've
never seen before say, "So you're the
one! I've heard all about it."

The payoff came the other day when
we knocked at the door of a total
stranger. A young coed answered—we
can't recall where or even if we had
ever met her before. She took one
look, drew back a bit in astonishment,
and said, "You were in jail."
Stuff like that is enough to give one

sufficient production to meet require-
ments.
Next, let us travel to Syracuse, New
York, where Miss Margaret Ingels is
engineering editor for the Carrier Cor-
poration. She obtained two degrees
in mechanical engineering from the
University of Kentucky. Then she
had four years of valuable engineering
experience with a pioneer air condi-
tioning company. By devoting herself
to research work for the next eight years,
she made herself an authority on prob-
lems connected with air conditioning.
Her studies were pursued in the re-
search laboratories of the American
Society of Heating and Ventilating
Engineers at the United States Bureau
of Mines in Pittsburgh and later for
the New York Commission on Ven-
tilation. Inevitably she was drawn
back to the Carrier Corporation. Her
training and experience had provided
her with the ability to pass on all
engineering information originating in
this company.
She has written many articles on
air conditioning for magazines and
technical publications. Her lectures on
that subject have been very effective
in the widespread demand for air con-
ditioning equipment for commercial
and industrial purposes.
Air conditioning is playing an im-
portant role in many industries essen-
tial to successful warfare. So Miss
Ingels finds her work more vital than
ever before. Precision instruments can
be made only in rooms where humidity,
temperature, and dust are controlled.
For munition plants, certain types of
ammunition must be made in air con-
ditioned factories to guard powder and
fuses. Rayon and nylon fabrics re-
quire complete control of atmospheric
conditions in their manufacture. Air
conditioning allows bomb-sights of
amazing accuracy to be manufactured
with greatest precision. Constantly
uniform temperature prevents expan-
sion and contraction of optical glass,
and so permits grinding to the nearly
incredible tolerance of 6/l,000,OOOths
of an inch.
Let us continue on to New York
City where Dr. Mary Pennington is
a consultant in refrigeration. Her train-
ing in chemistry was received at the
University of Pennsylvania. While she
was at the head of the Food Research
Laboratory for twelve years, she was
continually besieged by problems from
(Continued from page 11)
friends in the perishable food industry.
Under her leadership the staff of fifty-
five trained chemists, engineers, and
bacteriologists, conducted research into
scientific principles underlying proper
handling and packing of perishable
foods for shipment. At that time, the
loss in perishables was appalling. The
annual waste in eggs alone in the
United States amounted to fifty mil-
lion dollars. But the Food Research
Laboratory for the Bureau of Chem-
istry in the United States Department
of Agriculture revolutionized the con-
ditions influencing perishable foods,
from producer to consumer. Methods
of preparing perishable foods for mar-
ket and of shipping them were changed.
Dr. Pennignton was largely respon-
sible for the efficiency of the modern
refrigerator cars, as standardized in
the "United States Standard Type"
cars.
As an independent consultant, she
has supervised the design and construc-
tion of cold storages, precoolers, com-
mercial and household refrigerators.
She has saved millions of dollars'
worth of perishable foods. Air circu-
lation may go dead in a warehouse
containing half a million dollars' worth
of perishable foods. When Dr. Pen-
nington is called in as a consultant,
she is able to correctly diagnose the
case out of her wide experience.
Her work as a consultant is well
recognized by the entire refrigeration
industry. It is no wonder then that
the Garvan Gold Medal was awarded
her in 1940 for "distinguished work
in her field." This medal has been
conferred by the American Chemical
Society only twice.
In a city nearby, Miss Edith Clarke
has made a name for herself at Gen-
eral Electric Company. She computes
power loads on electrical transmission
systems in the plant at Schenectady.
Recently she completed a book on
power transmission, intended for use
as an engineering text and reference
book.
In another interesting field of work
is Hazel Quick, who studied civil en-
gineering at the University of Michigan.
She is assistant fundamental plant en-
gineer for the Michigan Bell Telephone
Company at Detroit. This involves
studies to determine the most econom-
ical plan of plant extension.
Dr. Louise Jordan is research paleon-
tologist for the Sun Oil Company in
Dallas, Texas. She has done field
work in Turkey. There she did in-
strument work to give directions in oil
drilling. As samples were brought to
the surface, she studied the "bugs" by
microscope. The index fossils identi-
fied the various geologic ages, and so
were a guide in drilling.
Women aeronautical engineers have
achieved distinction in various coun-
tries. Miss M. Elsa Gardner is editor
of Technical Data Digest for the U.
S. Army Air Corps at Wright Field,
Dayton, Ohio. Miss Elsie MacGill is
chief engineer for the Canadian Car
and Foundry Company. She designed
a training plane, which was turned over
to the Mexican government, when the
Canadian company started to manufac-
ture Hurricanes. In England, Miss
Dorothy Spicer and Miss Pauline Gower
did teamwork in aeronautical engineer-
ing. At an annual conference of the
Women's Engineering Society, Miss
Spicer read a paper on "Selection and
Treatment of Steels for Aero-Engines."
Miss Gower read one on "Ice Forma-
tion on Aircraft in Flight." Miss Spicer
held ground engineering licenses in all
four main categories. \Vhen war was
declared, she was given a job in re-
search and development of aero en-
gines in flight by the Ministry of Air-
craft Production.
Women engineers and scientists, who
have worked in Turkey and Russia,
report that native women have gone
in for engineering and the related fields
of work in much larger numbers than
in the United States. No prejudice
exists in those countries, against women
in the professions. They are limited
only by their training and ability. On
the other hand, enough prejudice exists
in the United States to force women
to become better trained, in order to
compete with men. Russia has so re-
cently advanced from a nation of 90
per cent illiterates, that one could not
expect the women to be as well trained
or as advanced in science as the women
of the United States. However, it
would not be surprising if Russia should

if this ratio is high and the electrolysis
is carried out at moderate current den-
sity and a high temperature, the de-
posited iron will be ductile, while if
carried out with a still higher F+H-f-
ratio and at a lower temperature, the
deposited iron will contain hydrogen
and will be fine grained, hard, and
brittle. This latter type of iron has
found use as a fine powder in the con-
struction of the cores of loading coils
on telephone circuits.. Very pure elec-
trolytic iron is used in the manufacture
of alloys for electromagnetic instru-
ments and machinery.
Another method of electrolytically
refining metals is known as electro-
winning, in which the ores, instead of
being first smelted and then deposited
electrolytically, are leached by a suitable
solution which becomes the electrolyte
of an electrolytic cell.
An extremely important industry of
this first group is the electrolysis of
alkali halides, usually sodium chloride,
to form chlorine at the anode and
hydrogen and alkali hydroxide at the
(Continued from page 12)
cathode, or hypochlorites and chlorates
if the anodic and cathodic products
are allowed to mix.
The basic electrochemical reactions
employed in the electrolysis are quite
simple, involving the neutralization of
the chlorine ion at the anode and the
liberation of hydrogen and formation
of the alkali hydroxide at the cathode.
There are however, about twenty types
of cells in use today, differing only in
design. The design is of course depend-
end upon the material wanted from
the process, i.e., chlorine, chlorates, or
are classified as to type and position
of electrode, static and circulating elec-
trolytes, and the diaphragm type of
cells. The circulating electrolyte, dia-
phragm type of cell is the one most
widely in use for salt electrolysis today.
Chemical industrial methods of mak-
ing chlorine have now been entirely
replaced by the electrochemical process.
The alkali produced is considered inci-
dental by the chlorine industries but in
1940 half the total caustic made in the
United States was from this process.

Heating a Nickel Plating Bath
Hydrogen and oxygen are produced
on a large scale in this country by the
electrolysis of a 15 to 25 per cent
solution of sodium or potassium hy-
droxide. Although not as much hydro-
gen is made by this process as conies
from water gas and coke ovens, it is
a convenient method for private indus-
trial users who make their own gas.
It is also made by electric companies
located nearby users of hydrogen and
oxygen. Here, the generating equip-
ment which is kept standing by to
satisfy a peak demand that may occur
only one hour in a year, is used as
a current source.
All the electrochemical reactions de-
scribed above may be considered oxida-
tion reactions at the anode and reduc-
tion reactions at the cathode. How-
ever, the oxidation usually consisted
of the removal or addition of one or
more electrons so that the element was
then present in its free state. Use is
made in some industries of these oxida-
tion and reduction reactions to form
new products and also the formation of
new products by certain reactions with
nascent hydrogen, oxygen, and chlorine
that may be liberated. Persulphates.
perborates, ferricyanides, and perman-
ganates are all prepared commercially
in this manner.
The Sperry process for the production
of white lead is-r.another important
electrochemical industry. This is a bi-
fluid process in which a lead anode and
an iron cathode are suspended in solu-
tions of sodium acetate_ containing sodi-
um carbonate and separated by a linen
diaphragm. The catholyte contains a
much higher carbonate iron concentra-
tion than the anolyte and when the
lead anode is dissolved into the anolyte.
white lead is formed, the catholyte then
acting as a feeder solution to keep the
carbonate concentration'of, the r.nnlyte
constant. Cadmium yello.w (CdS) is
made in much the same way.
Soft and hard rubber coatings may
be applied to metal articles by elec-
trolysis of a latex mix, the rubber coat-
ing (up to 1/4" thick) plating out on
the anode.

teristics of •thV ions ofsohie metals

by electrolysis of an aqueous solution
or reduction by carbon. In such cases
the metals are usually produced by the
electrolysis of their fused salts. Alumi-
num, sodium, potassium, magnesium,
and beryllium are obtained in this way.
The actual electrolysis of these salts
is ionic in nature and the electrode re-
actions are similar to the electrolysis
of an aqueous solution of the salt, al-
lowing for the fact that no water is
present.
The most common and also the most
complicated of the processes of this
group is the production of aluminum.
(See Michigan Technic, April, 1942.)
The Bayer process is the one most
widely used, yet it is technically one
of the most difficult to operate and
control. This process is not one for
the refining of aluminum but for the
processing of the bauxite ore into alumi-
na (ALO;,) from which the aluminum
metal is obtained by electrolysis of a
molten solution of the alumina in fused
cryolite (AlF33NaF). The production
of aluminum is based on the fact that
the other metals will not be decom-
posed, being more electro-positive than
aluminum.
External heat is not applied to keep
the salts molten, the heat all coming
from the current. The cathode is the
container in which the electrolysis takes
place, being made of iron lined with
carbon, and the anode is usually petro-
leum coke. Each pot is kept in con-
tinual operation by the addition of
alumina and the removal of the molten
metal from time to time. The alumi-
num produced in this operation is about
99.7% pure, therefore refining opera-
tions are carried out in a cell similar
to the reduction cell but by using an
electrolyte of such a density that the
aluminum metal will float on the top.
Aluminum thus refined is guaranteed
99.8% pure, the highest purity ever
obtained being 99.983%. The princi-
ple impurity is copper, iron and silicon
being present in small amounts.
Commercial production of magnesium
has been carried out only since the
beginning of the present century and,
although two methods have been used,
the "chloride" and "oxide" processes,
the chloride process is the only one in
use in the United States at the present
time.
In this process the metal is obtained
by the electrolytic decomposition of
molten magnesium chloride. The mag-
nesium chloride is obtained from brine
wells and goes through several processes
to separate it from the bromine, sodium
chloride, and calcium chloride present.
The actual electrolytic process is very
similar to the aluminum process except
that external heat must be supplied
to the cells to keep the salt in a molt-
en state. The magnesium produced is
99.90 to 99.95% pure if the raw ma-
terials are pure, and no further refining
is necessary.
There is no great commercial demand
for metallic sodium and calcium but
they are prepared in the same way,
sodium by the electrolysis of the hy-
droxide and calcium by the electrolysis
of the chloride.
When we enter the electrothermal
group we are not, strictly speaking,
dealing with electrochemistry. How-
ever, the industries in which heat is
produced by electricity in order that
some reaction might take place are
included with the electrochemical indus-
tries.
There are three main methods of
electric heating, namely, resistance heat-
ing, arc heating, and induction heating.
The type of heating used is depend-
ent upon the process. The metal metling
furnace is usually of the arc type and
may be direct or indirect, depending
upon whether the arc is between two
electrodes or between the electrode and
the molten metal. The most common
type of electric furnace is the Heroult
furnace in which the arc passes from
one electrode to the slag, to the metal
beneath, back to the slag, and then to
another electrode. This particular fur-
nace is used for making steel and has
the advantage that very close control
can be maintained over the final product.
Electric discharge in air to form
nitric oxide (NO) for making nitric
acid is still another of the industries.
There are two theories regarding the
formation of this compound. The
thermal theory presumes the formation
of the oxides is a function of the tem-
perature. Investigation has shown that
the theory is inadequate and it is be-
lieved that formation of the NO is due
to the union of nitrogen and oxygen
atoms which were produced by disso-
ciation in the powerful electric field
of the arc.

PROFESSIONAL ETHICS
The winner of the professional ethics
problem for the month of November
will be announced in the Michigan
Daily. Entries for this month's contest
must be in the office of the TECHNIC,
Room 3036 East Engineering Building
by January 1st, 1943. The response to
the problem presented last month was
excellent—now tackle this one.
Mr. Jones has been working nine
years for a well-known manufacturer
of industrial drying equipment. He
is an intelligent and energetic man of
about thirty-five years. During the
nine years Mr. Jones has worked for
this company he helped to design new
phases of the equipment and has be-
come familiar with all the drying equip-
ment made by this company since he
has sold their product. Mr. Jones could
be considered a success in his work for
this company.
In the light of Mr. Jones' experience
with this company and in comparison
to the salaries other men receive doing
similar work with competing companies,
Mr. Jones is grossly underpaid. In
his connections with other companies
this fact is known and a competitor
offers him a position with them to do
work similar to that which he is now
doing, offering a much larger salary.
Mr. Jones, being human and wanting
to receive the most results for his ef-
orts, considered the offer seriously, but
decided to discuss it with his present
employer before making a final decis-
ion. However, his employer receives
his problem coldly and can offer no
help at the present. Mr. Jones knows
that if he went to the other company,
he could practically duplicate the equip-
ment of his present employer by simply"
manipulating the design to conform to
patent laws.
Would you advise Mr. Jones to
change employers and, if so, how far
should he duplicate the equipment of
his present employer; or, should he
continue working where he is and hope
to receive more compensation later?

Worn metal teeth no longer shelve the
Tool — nor do they mean costly, hard-

tense heat of the oxyacetylene flame,
the Airco Hard-Facing Process quickly
"builds-up" the worn metal. Parts thus
rebuilt can be expected to out-live and
out-produce new parts.
Airco Hard-Facing is doing an un-
precedented job today in conserving
time and material. Parts of practically
any shape and size, which are subject
to abrasion, can be rebuilt economic-
ally, speedily. Standard oxyacetylene

Many other applications of the oxy-
acetylene flame are finding ever widen-
ing use in speeding and improving
production of ships, tanks, guns, roll-
ing stock and planes. This versatile tool
slices through steel with remarkable
speed — welds metal into strong, light
units —sweeps surface rust from metal
structures to extend the life of paint
jobs — gouges steel and iron quickly

cumulative effects of the five operational
disturbances of wear, dirt, deflection,
stock variation, and working-piece
difficulties he must be forever
vigilant. For these five operating

in each machining operation. This is
to be a continuing achievement on each
workpiece as it goes through the line-
up at a competitive tool cost. Thus
productive tool engineers with the
requisite ''know how'' ability are the

disturbances are the causes of all op-
erational scrap in lieu of which his
plans were made.
In addition to carrying the respon-
sibility for planning a correct sequence
of tooling operations on correct ma-
chines properly adapted for the par-
ticular product being made, inculcating
the primary principle of "scrapless tool-
ing first", he is also responsible for
getting out production at a rate which
will meet competition. Then as soon
as his line-ups go into production, his
attention is immediately called to bot-
tle-necks, operations which cannot pro-
duce enough in a given time to keep
the subsequent operation up to capacity.
Should he simply suggest the purchase
of equipment for the addition of a
similar operation to carry the load, he
then is confronted with raising the pro-
prietor's investment costs. In brief,
our hypothetical example shows that
whereas the productive tool engineer
has an economic purpose to serve in
saving the proprietor money, his first
and primarily professional objective is
one of establishing a producing accuracy
technical brains of the mechanical
processing industries.
They really are the manufacturing
strategists. They are the organizers of
the batteries of machines for production.
They supervise, design, make, arrange,
and fit machines, tools and equipment
together so that the whole string of
machines operate as smoothly as one
machine so that the many line-ups in
the plant are so well co-ordinated that
the plant functions as one great ma-
chine. Their ideal of effectiveness for
operators is a "maximum of results
with a minimum of effort," which in-
deed is the functional ideal of industry.
Since they are watchdogs of com-
petitive values, it is their business to
check the manufacture of an article
which might be reaching the market
at too high a cost. In this they may
demand a redesign of product, or they
may call for purchase of new equip-
ment. In large and vigorous organi-
zations their varied functions are listed
under the heading of engineering duties.
They are the staff officers to the works
manager or general plant superintend-
ent, to which positions they, if admin-
istratively inclined, frequently levitate.
They are separate from product design-
ers to prevent overlapping authority,
though many tooling engineers are
product engineers grown wise in manu-
facturing processes. But they now are
to the product design engineers what
the product inspection division is to
the production division. They check
the sometimes wierd product designs
to make them adaptable to available
production methods. They work hand-
in-hand with the work planning depart-
ment to maintain balanced machine-
tool loads. Seasonally they are asso-
ciated with the plant layout depart-
ment. They are daily being confronted
with manufacturing alternatives. No
other engineering field demands as much
in the understanding of such diverse
application of mechanical principles and
close controls over the operating dis-
turbances.

mercial freight transport by air
draws measurably closer. Vast
quantities of this lightest of struc-
tural metals are being used in the
construction of aircraft for our

be available for industry at large
after Victory is won. Thus from

turbine, direct connection of the pro-
peller shaft to the power plant was no
longer possible. Since the turbine was
more efficient, which meant that more
power for a given weight of machinery
was available, the turbine supplanted
the reciprocating engine as a source of
power. Of necessity, there followed a
replacement of direct drive by some
speed reducing rechanism. Belts were
impractical because of the amount of
power that had to be transferred. There-
fore, gear reduction drive was adapted to
marine use.
For many years gears held sway and
all turbine power plants were thus me-
chanically coupled to the propeller shaft.
This meant that the turbine was run at
varying speeds for maneuvering or any
speed variations. Since a turbine cannot
be reversed, a gear shifting mechanism
was necessary. Furthermore, the tur-
bines were no longer operating at peak
efficiency when the speed deviated from
the optimum value.
The next development was turbo-
electric drive, which permitted the tur-
bine to operate at its most efficient speed
at all times. The gear trains were re-
placed by a generator and an electric
motor. In the larger ships, there were
several turbines with their generators,
and a motor for each propeller shaft.
This permitted flexible speed variation,
and improved efficiency of operation, but
had the disadvantage of increasing
weight. In large luxury liners, and air-
craft carriers such as the Saratoga, this
was not too great a disadvantage. How-
ever, turbo-electric drive took up too
much space and added too much weight
to be used in a destroyer. This and the
simplicity of gears is the reason for their
use on our modern battleships, the North
Carolina, Washington, Massachusetts,
Indiana, New Jersey and Alabama.
The high speeds and tremendous
power needed for these large battle-
wagons has led to the development of
herringbone gears of mammoth propor-
tions. In the accompanying illustration
are shown huge navy propulsion gears
in process of manufacture.
Herringbone gears are used in pref-
erence to helical gears to eliminate end
thrust on the shaft. This makes bear-
ing requirements simpler, and since the
herringbone gear is in effect a double
helical, it carries with it the advantages
of a helical gear. The inherent advan-
tages of a helical gear are greater power
transferability because of the larger
tooth contact area, and smoother power
transfer than is possible with a spur
gear.
New technique in the generation of
helical gears has lowered the cost of pro-
duction until their advantages now out-
weigh their additional cost for many
applications. At first two complemen-
tary helical gears were separately cut
and then fastened together. This was
too complicated and involved alignment
difficulties between meshed gears. It
was found that a channel around the
periphery of the casting enabled the
herringbone gear to be cut from one
piece of metal, thereby eliminating these
difficulties. The suspended casting in
the illustration is a herringbone gear
blank, and the channel can clearly be
seen.
In the smaller illustration, Navy petty
officers are inspecting the construction
of electrical equipment for a submarine.

Not a single intersection, traffic light,
nor railroad crossing is included in the
first link of the Detroit Industrial Ex-
pressway connecting the Willow Run
area with metropolitan Detroit. Pro-
viding adequate highway facilities for
the transportation of men and materials
from Detroit to the bomber plant, the
highway will serve as an outlet to the
access road system recently built around
three sides of the Willow Run plant
and will be ready for service Decem-
ber IS. A portion is already in use.
The Willow Run access system of di-
vided lane highways, two tri-level road
separations and two other grade sep-
arations makes it possible for work-
ers to leave the main roads and drive
directly into their parking lots. No
intersections, railroad or pedestrian
crossings impede their movements.
Built in the war era to serve an
emergency need, the Expressway is
planned to tie in with the proposed
Detroit Crosstown Expressway and
eventually become part of the Detroit-
Chicago interregional expressway, which
will afford a speedy means of trans-
portation for trucks and passenger cars
between those cities.
Another feature of Michigan's first
continuous limited access highway is
the high design speed with interchanges
all of the directional type. This means
that traffic can turn either right or
left without sharp intersections. Also,
a driver wishing to turn left can do so
without having to complete a circle to
the right first, and vice versa. The
Expressway has wide, stabilized shoul-
ders and flat slopes throughout except
immediately adjacent to structures.
Planning provisions were made for fu-
ture widening.

HE has just turned eighteen. Shaves twice a week
and maybe a hair or two is sprouting on his
chest. He shies away now when his dad tries to be
affectionate and we noticed some lipstick on one of
his handkerchiefs after a country club junior dance
not so long ago. But it seems only yesterday, perhaps
it was the day before, that he was a chubby legged kid
swinging from the arch of the doorway, leading to the
dining room, in a gadget that was something like a
breeches buoy and he was sucking at the end of a
turkey bone.
He went back to school this Fall, a tall, athletic lad,
budding into manhood, but there was something else
on his mind beside the football and hockey teams or the
little blonde girl with whom he had "palled" around
during the Summer. It seems as though he was listening
for a certain call—the Clarion call that poets sing
about—and, perhaps we just imagined it, but we
thought we saw an upward jutting of his chin, a cer-
tain light in his eyes, and a sort of a rearing-to-go
expression in his face.
It chilled us a bit in the region of our heart, when we
thought of his discarding the sports coat for the
"O.D." of the Army or the blue of the Navy. There
was a bit of a catch in our throat as we thought of his
putting aside his football helmet for one of steel; of
his hanging up his hockey stick and reaching for a
gun. After all we still regard him as just a little boy.
They tell us that the eighteen and nineteen year old
lads are to be called to the service. When that day
comes to us there will be prayers, but no tears. We
shall not mourn nor shall we be fearful. Rather there
will come welling up from our hearts that warm feel-
ing of pride that millions of other parents will sense
when their beloved lads marched away. Our lad is no
different than the others. We are no different than
other loving parents, nor is our sacrifice any greater.
They are going to make great soldiers, sailors, marines
and fliers out of these youngsters. And they will be-
come a mighty force when they take their places be-
side their brothers in arms. They too know what they
fight for. They too know full well of the sacrifices that
must be made before the evil powers that threaten the
world can be overcome.
And Jet us not forget that they are counting on us.
They know that we shall not fail them.
God be with them and their brothers.

Methods of synthesis for these sub-
stances follow:
Styrene (ethylene with one hydrogen
replaced by benzene) is produced by
treating benzene with ethylene over an
aluminum chloride catalyst (followed
by heating to 900 degrees Centigrade.
Acrylonitrile (ethylene with one hy-
drogen replaced by a cyanide group) is
produced by three principal methods.
(1) Treatment of B-Monochloroethanol
followed by dehydration over a
potassium bisulphate catalyst.
(2) Heating complex nitrile compound.
(3) Treatment of ethylene oxide with
hydrogen cyanide.
The easiest process for converting
these monomers into a rubber-like sub-
stance is an emulsion process. The buta-
diene and its comonomer (either styrene
or acrylonitrile) are suspended in water
with the aid of some wetting agent
such as soap. Polymerization catalysts
and modifying agents are added to the
emulsion to promote polymerization and
to control the length of the chains
of molecules formed. The polymeriza-
tion catalysts are oxidizing agents such
as hydrogen peroxide, sodium perbor-
ate, and organic peroxides and per acids.
The modifying agents are usually or-
ganic halogens or sulfur compounds.
The reaction mixture is heated for
from ten to fifteen hours at a tempera-
ture of from forty to sixty degrees
Centigrade. The resulting latex is very
similar to the latex of natural rubber.
However, unless this synthetic material
is treated with proper antioxidants, it
will further polymerize into a hard ma-
terial which is very difficult to process.
The processing and important physical
properties of the material obtained de-
pend primarily upon the relative length
of linear and side chains in the poly-
merized material. This ratio in turn
depends upon the control of the poly-
merization reaction with modifying
agents and antioxidants.
Neoprene, another synthetic of the
butadiene based type, until just recently
has led the synthetic field in production.
It was developed in the du Pont labora-
tories several years ago and has been
produced several years ago and has
been produced in small quantities ever
since. Neoprene rubber is a polymer-
ized chloro derivative of butadiene.
A product from the second group
listed is Koroseal. It is made by poly-
merizing vinyl chloride into a very
hard material. This substance is then
plasticized by the addition of varying
amounts of high boiling organic esters.
Depending upon the amount of plasti-
cizer used, products may be made which
range from semi-hard materials through
rubbery materials having a very high
degree of elongation to thermoplastic
gels.
Thiokols are organic polysulfides
formed by the reaction of organic di-
halides with sodium tetrasulfide in an
aqueous medium. Thiokols are gener-
ally elastoplastic materials. That is,
they deform permanently at room tern-
may be made between the desirable
properties of natural and synthetic
rubber:
Synthetics are superior in:
(1) Resistance to deterioration by oils
and organic solvents.
(2) Resistance to oxidation by heat,
oxidizing agents, and sunlight.
(3) Lower permeability to gases.
Natural rubber is superior in:
(1) Processing properties.
(2) Extensibility and elasticity.
(3) Resiliency.
(4) Resistance to stiffening at low
temperatures.

perature when subjected to a constant
load.
Up to the present time our entire
output of synthetic rubber has been
consumed in places where its properties
make it more desirable than the natural
product. The oil resistance properties
of Buna-N, Neoprene, and Thiokol are
made use of in all types of hose re-
quired by the petroleum industry. Neo-
prene, Thiokol, and Koroseal are used
extensively in printing rolls, engraving
plates, and in gaskets and diaphragms
for oil pumps. A general comparison
duction figures are of a greater in-
terest and concern than the particular
properties of the substances themselves.
In 1941 over eighteen tons of synthetic
rubber of various types were produced
in the United States. This represents
about three per cent of our normal
thousand tons. The reason that our
production of synthetic rubber was so
low was that synthetic rubber could
not compete with natural rubber on the
basis of cost unless it was produced on
a very large scale. Private enterprise

of Future should a man
prepare for?
One thing is certain: The future is going
to be very different.
Now, as you finish your training, many
of you with your war participation fully
determined, the future of peacetime seems
very remote.
It is a bridge we're all going to have to
cross when we come to it. Nobody knows
exactly what it will look like. But we do
know that what lies on the other side will
be largely what all of us together make it.
Even now, responsible men in industry
are thinking how to make jobs for the men
coming back from the services, and for the
men now in war applications. It will be
done by dreaming up new things to make,
and new ways to make old things better.
This is being done by a combination of
imagination and engineering, industry by
industry. Here at Alcoa Aluminum we call
it Imagineering. It is the thing that made
our company the leader in its industry—
that got aluminum ready to do the great job
it is doing in this war. All our people
practice Imagineering, as second nature,
whether they are called engineers, or sales-
men, or production men, or research men.
The future isn't going to be made out of
laws, or pacts, or political shibboleths. The
only kind of future worth having will come
out of freedom to produce, and out of the
Imagineering of men who make the things
that civilization rests on.
If we could go back to college again, we
would get ready to be an Imagineer, in
whatever particular field our interests lay.
The opportunity for young men with imagi-
nation is going to be unparalleled.

which have highlighted the past decade
in an industry which had marked time
for so many years.
In operation for one glass manufac-
turing company is a machine that of-
fers an almost unbelievable contrast
between the efforts of the glass making
industry of comparatively a few years
ago and the streamlined, ultra modern
glass business of today. This machine
is the Pilkington tank, a mechanical
triumph which combines the operations
of plate glass manufacture into one
almost continuous process. The "batch,"
or mixture for making glass—consisting
basically of silica sand, limestone, soda
ash, and salt cake—is mixed in a hop-
per and automatically conveyed to a
chute above the furnace section of the
Pilkington machine. From there it is
fed at intervals as needed into a molten
"lake" of glass being melted at a 2,800
degree temperature. As this "lake"
of molten glass is replenished at one
end with fresh mixture, the melted
glass, in an endless, glowing carpet is
passing from the furnace between rollers
which govern the width and thickness
of the glass, and thence into a lehr, or
annealing oven several hundred feet in
length, where it goes through a gradual
cooling process until it emerges at the
far end of the machine. It is then cut
in various sizes for delivery to another
section of the plant for grinding and
polishing.
Equally astounding to the uniniti-
ated is the huge battery of grinding

and polishing machines which give the
final "touch" to the glass from the
Pilkington tank. The glass first is car-
ried by a continuously moving conveyor
under a series of rotating grinders where
it is bathed in a solution of sand and
water while the soft iron core of the
grinders is removing surface defects
and corrugations.
The sand and water solution varies
from coarse to fine during this process
until the glass moves under a second
group of swiftly-rotating felt polishing
discs where a 'rouge" of soft iron oxide
is used to give it the shining surface
you can see in the plate glass windows
of store fronts, homes, and offices all
over the world.
On this final polishing line is wit-
nessed an impressive example of the
union of power and precision which ex-
emplifies the glass industry of today.
The polishing discs, which wear swiftly,
are changed at intervals by an auto-
matic crane process which slips one bank
of polishers from place and moves an-
other in without stopping for a frac-
tion of a second the slow passage of
the glass plates beneath them. During
this changing process not a single, in-
finitesimal portion of the glass is missed
by the giant polishers.

The thousands of experienced engineers who are doing so
much to help win victory were students once, and no doubt
often wondered what they would do after graduation—just as
you probably do now.
But they didn't permit thoughts of the future to interfere with
the present. They prepared for whatever might be ahead. Among
other things they learned to know their bearings—knowledge
that has proved to be one of their most useful engineering assets.
You'll find it one of yours, too.
After world-wide destruction must come world-wide reconstruc-
tion; Timken Tapered Roller Bearings will play as important
a part in the new machines of peace as they are doing in the
machines of war.
If you have not done so already, begin now to acquire a thorough

was not willing to take the risk involved
in starting out in synthetic rubber pro-
duction on a big time basis.
As early as 1940, when the Far East-
ern situation became more threatening,
Congress was investigating the feasi-
bility of building large government-
financed, privately-operated plants.
Units which would produce thirty-five
and one hundred thousand tons per
year were considered.
Meanwhile many private companies
have been expanding their facilities for
the production of synthetic rubber.
Du Pont is building a new Neoprene
plant in Louisville and is increasing
the capacity of its old plant. The B.
F. Goodrich company is expanding its
Koroseal plant at Niagara Falls, New
York.
Recently, because of reversals in the
Far East, Congress passed a bill author-
izing the expenditure of seven hundred
million dollars on the synthetic rubber
industry. Buna-S, the favorite among
the butadiene types will receive seven-
eighths of that figure. Leon Hender-
son expects the United States to be
producing 350,000 tons per year by the
end of 1943 and 800,000 tons by the
end of 1944. These figures mean an
astronomical increase in production in
a new industry which is barely out of
the pilot plant stage. Last year our
entire production of synthetic rubber
was a paltry 17,000 tons.
According to the measure that was
originally passed by Congress, the ma-
jority of the butadiene was to be ob-
tained from petroleum. Last summer
the House passed and sent to the White
House a bill which would require the
government to revise its synthetic rub-
ber production program and use a larger
quantity of farm products as a base
material. It was argued by the farm
bloc and by many scientists that the
method of producing butadiene from
grain alcohol is a more economical
method than that used in obtaining
butadiene from petroleum. The meth-
od of production and the cost of pro-
duction are secondary to the need for
the material itself.
If production of synthetic rubber is
accelerated as rapidly as possible, the
United States can change from the
use of natural to synthetic rubber by
careful conservation and allocation of
existing supplies of natural and scrap
rubber without handicapping its war
machine.

look best at Swing-Out. It always sur-
prises her now to see they are growing
old when she meets them again at class
reunions.
When the call came for all depart-
ment heads to write histories of their
departments, she looked up data for
many of them. Becoming interested in
the history of the college, she continued
this as a hobby and now has a very ex-
tensive collection of photographs and in-
formation on the growth of the Univer-
sity. She has found it fascinating work
looking through the records in following
the history of some particular building.
When she noticed that the windows in
one building were of different shapes,
some research eventually revealed an
addition had been made.
"Back in 1907 the engineers dressed
with distinction," Mrs. Green reflects.
"They cut the brims off their hats, or
scalloped them. Turtle-neck sweaters
were then the vogue. Tuition was $55
per year, and room and board were
about $5 a week for the best available.
Annual expenses were listed at $300, the
TECHNIC appeared twice a year, and
Mimes was just starting. It was thrill-
ing to watch the 'girls' come out on the
stage and then sing in deep voices."
Mrs. Green has been a football fan
ever since 1919 and still listens to all
the games. In addition to her main
hobby of gathering data on Michigan
history, she collects bells and antique
dolls. Issues of early American stamps
and raising flowers also keep her time
occupied.
Her policy as Assistant Secretary has
been to be helpful to the students and
treat them well. Perhaps you have no-
ticed the prompt and courteous atten-
tion you receive in the Secretary's office
—thank Mrs. Green for originating the
policy.
Mrs. Green has no philosophy or ad-
vice to give to the engineers for she has
found them pretty good at settling their
own problems. "Engineers work so hard
they stay out of trouble, or do not stay
in the Engine School!" Her own ob-
servation on life has been that, "Small
disappointments and gains affect one's
life strongly when young because they
are colored by his enthusiasm. When
one has seen fifty winters come and go
his enthusiasm is more settled and life
becomes more serene. The years even
lose their individual identity then.'

TRIVIA
By Sid Shell
ATER receiving a degree in civil
engineering from the University
of Michigan in 1915, Miss ALICE C.
GOFF was employed by the Truscon
Steel Company of Youngstown, Ohio.
She has been continuously in their
employ since that time in various ca-
pacities, such as designer and estimator
of reinforced buildings, some of which
have taken her to Venezuela, where the
structures must be designed to resist
earthquakes.
At least one of our authors is grateful
for our having published his article. For
DONALD O'NEILL, '43 Chem, has
been looking, for his essay on synthetic
rubber since he first wrote it for Tau Beta
Pi. Wishing to kill the two proverbial
birds with one paper Don wanted to
use the material for that useful English
course taught by Professors Thornton
and Walton, English 6, "Report Writ-
ing", only 2 hours, (adv.) After looking
for it thru hell and high water, Don was
flabbergasted when a Technic man calm-
ly walked up to him with article in hand
and requested permission to publish hi?
paper in the Technic. Too grateful to
resist our request accounts for the high-
ly interesting resume of the synthetic
rubber situation.
Productive Tooling Engineering is not
usually considered a sharply defined
phase of mechanical engineering, but
R. G. FREEMAN, who received his B.S.
in Civil Engineering in 1921, aptly
demonstrates the importance of engi-
neering control in mass production in-
dustries, where uniformity of quality
with minimum waste is the ultimate in
achievement.
An insight into the electrochemical in-
dustries is the point of view of the art-
icle by PAUL KENNEDY, '44 Chem
If you hang around East Engine lonp
enough, you're sure to see a bunch of
freckles set off by a mop of red hair.
A top-notch Technic man, Paul still
finds time to be invited out to dinner
by feminine "acquaintances." Here at
the office we are a little worried as to
how long we can keep him, since he is
considering enlisting in Meteorology.

almost 4 billion dollars!
Where did these accidents happen? Two-thirds of
them happened outside of industry. In the home, where

EDUCATION: MILITARY OR TECHNICAL?
T-h NGINEERINC education since
*-* the start of World War II has
been faced with a twofold demand
for its product—that of providing
badly needed engineerign talent for
a greatly expanded war industry
(whose normal demands alone ab-
sorb most of the engineering gradu-
ates), together with meeting the
equally great demand of the En-
gineering branches of the armed
forces. This is without doubt a very
difficult problem, both as to the man-
ner of meeting the total demand and
for providing in the curriculum the
balance between the two require-
ments. It has been solved thus far
principally by allowing the civilian
engineering schools to provide tech-
nical training, with the Army and
Navy providing the military back-
ground at the same time. In this
respect the University of Michigan
is particularly fortunate in that its
ROTC and NROTC units are volun-
tary, leaving the matter of military
training up to the ability and desire
of the student to meet the military
requirements, plus a slight incentive
from his draft board.
Recently, however, there have
been ominous notes from Washing-
ton, brought to light by a recent
article in the Daily, to the effect
that Army and Navy control would
be greatly extended in the colleges
throughout the nation, in a some-
what similar fashion to what took
place at Michigan during World
War I. However that may be, it is
sufficient to say that such plans are
being given serious thought.
Throughout the summer and fall
the ROTC on the Michigan campus
has undergone an acceleration in its
program. This we think has been
all to the good, both for the ROTC
students and the rest of the Univer-
sity. The students have come to
regard their ROTC training as some-
thing vastly more important and
worth while, for which the ROTC
staff, and in particular Colonel
Ganoe, should be given credit.
However, this we do know—the
accelerated ROTC program has
caused a very definite drain on other
extracurricular activities. This is
certainly nothing to bemoan in itself,
for ROTC is infinitely more impor-
tant than any extracurricular activity
ever could be. It does bring out the
fact, though, that there is a very real
limit on the total amount of work
any student can do in a week, and
while the majority of the advanced
ROTC cadets are activities men and
hence are peculiarly adapted to the
accelerated ROTC program, there is
no assurance that some of extensive
military training for the rest of the
students would not have adverse ef-
fects upon their scholastic activities,
both in terms of point averages and
semester credit hours. We realize
that the demands of total war re-
quire complete and unqualified par-
ticipation by everyone, and it is not
upon any desire to escape eventual
military duty that this argument is
based. Also, it is quite foolish to say
that such training as PEM seeks to
give can be gained equally well in
concentrated courses after gradua-
tion. Rather the point is this:
Whether he be in the armed forces or
not, is an engineer's primary contri-
bution to the war effort achieved
through his knowledge military—or
his knowledge technical? In short, if
a student must divide his time be-
tween "right shoulder arms" and
"thermodynamics," can he do the job
efficiently? Maybe we're wrong, but
we think not.

Labor, particularly inexperienced labor, cannot be
expected to recognize the full penalties of careless-
ness in the shop. Management has assumed the re-
sponsibility of supervising safety measures, and has
cooperated in establishing sound safety rules.
Nevertheless, the large increase in labor personnel
due to war needs, plus the influx of inexperienced
men, have resulted in a substantial increase in lost
time accidents.
Even assuming that the obvious safety measures
with regard to operating machinery, electrical equip-
the National Safety Council
ment and shop traffic have been installed, two fac-
tors — education and eternal vigilance — determine
the real effectiveness of any safety program.
Both are the responsibility of the supervisory staff,
from foremen up. The foreman who does a thorough
job of educating his particular group in safety rules
and cooperative enforcement has done much to cut
down accidents. Management that takes an active
interest in both safety education and the enforcement
of safety measures has taken a great step forward in
reducing wastage of irreplaceable production time.

... Variable-pitch propellers, formerly
used on engines of less than 650 brake
horsepower, are being used on a Swedish
cargo-pasenger line which is powered
by two 3500 brake horsepower single-
acting two-strcke diesel engines. These
two diesel engines are connected direct-
ly to the variable pitch propellers. The
pitch of the propeller is varied by an oil
motor which is located in the hub. The
oil pressure can be varied to obtain any
desired pitch, hence, increasing the effi-
ciency of the propeller. If the oil pres-
sure should fail, a safety spring sets
the blades for going ahead.
... In handling armor plate the usual
method was to cool the plate after it
had been rolled by sprays or immer-
sions. However, this practice left the
plate very much distorted and then it
had to be straightened out in huge
presses. This took considerable time be-
cause of the size of some armor plates.
Now engineers can reduce the time to 3
to 8 minutes after the plate leaves the
rolling mill. Two hollow plates are con-
nected to the jaws of a large press and
when the hot plate comes from the mill,
it is placed between the hollow plates
through which water is forced at a very
high speed. The water cools the plate
while the pressure of the jaws prevents
the plate from warping.
... A specially designed torched tip

. . . Radio waves are being used to coat
steel with tin. The usual procedure is
to dip the plate in the tin. For every
10 pounds of steel, I1/-; pounds of tin
are needed. Briefly this new method is
an electrolytic operation. The steel
passes through a chemical bath of tin,
which is deposited on the steel. Un-
fortunately, the tin plated on was dull,
indicating the surface was not smooth.
To obtain a smooth finish the inventors
passed the tinned plate through a coiled
copper tube to a tank of water where
it was coiled cooled again. In passing
through the coiled copper tube radio
waves whipped around the steel causing
the tin to melt because of the counter
currents set up on the surface. This
melted down the minute hills and as the
plate went through the water, it was
cooled. These high frequency waves
came from a small radio transmitting
station. If these waves could be made to
rip off the atoms from the tin peaks,
enough heat would be generated to melt
the tin. This was precisely what it did
do and because of this invention it is
now possible to plate the tin on steel
using only \'-&gt; pound instead of ll/2
pounds.

AT
WAR
THOSE who have been actively con-
nected with the engineering profes-
sion from the Spanish-American War,
thru World War I, and to the present
time, will realize the profound changes
and increased importance of that profes-
sion. This period in American history
covers some forty-five years. During
that time marked advances have been
made, and several branches of the engi-
neering profession have developed that
hitherto were unknown or otherwise un-
defined. Even a casual reflection on
the many advances made during this
period will indicate that no branch or
outlet for demonstrating the utility of
the profession of engineering has been
more marked than when our country
was in a state of war. Unlike many
other countries that persistently culti-
vated the desire for war, developing and
maintaining in times of peace huge mili-
tary establishments, the established Am-
erican policy has been towards peace,
with a minimum allowance for military
purposes. While our lack of preparation
for war in times of peace has been
marked, as compared to many other
countries, the technical problems created
during and following each war served as
an impetus to still greater effort on the
part of the engineering profession to
surmount such lack of preparation. In
this brief article some of the outstanding
advances of the engineering profession
as applied to and utilized in war activ-
ities will be outlined.
Spanish-A mcrkan War— 1898-1902
The Spanish-American War broke out
suddenly, following a long period of
peace and prosperity in the United
States. It was comparatively a short
war and was brought to a successful
conclusion without the aid of any other
nation. Outside of the U. S. Corps of
Engineers, and the nucleus of a few
other engineering government bureaus,
this country was little prepared for this
conflict with an European nation. For-
tunately its duration was short, but long
before its end, it was plainly evident
that we were sadly lacking in many lines

Lucius Allen
of engineering, which lack led to the loss
of many men in the military service.
This was especially true in the line of
Sanitary Engineering, which at that
period had been little developed or ap-
plied to military movements. Sanitary
conditions in many army camps, which
could easily have been corrected by
modern engineering methods, were left
to non-professionals who did not realize
the importance of pure drinking water,
sanitary latrines, etc. It was also early
recognized that in the line of ordnance
our country was far behind that of even
Spain, a large portion of our military
service still being equipped with the old
Springfield ritle. While our Navy was
undoubtedly the better equipped, the
use of the submarine, long rangecannon,
radio communications, and numerous
other items of modern war facilities
were non-existent.
Almost immediately following the close
of the Spanish-American War, and due
largely to the experience and lack of
preparation prior to its outbreak, it was
evident that better means of commun-
ications must be had, both for commer-
cial and military purposes, between the
Atlantic and Pacific, the outcome being
the construction of the Panama Canal,
an outstanding engineering feat of Amer-
ican engineering methods of construc-
tion. Greater attention was also given
to improved sanitation, water supply,
and to the development of wireless com-
munications, both on land and sea. The
scope and enlargement of several engi-
neering government activities took
place, all of which was primarily
caused by the acquisition as a result
of the war to territory beyond our bor-
ders in both the Atlantic and Pacific.
World War I.
Some fifteen years elapsed from the
close of the Spanish-American War until
this country entered World War I. Dur-
ing this interim vast changes and ad-
vances in all branches of the engineering
profession had taken place. Some of
these advances had taken place as a
result of war, and the admitted necessity
of greater improvements in all branches
of military science; others to the ad-
vancement of commerce and economic
conditions. Civil, mechanical, electrical,
chemical, sanitary, marine, areonautical,
as well as many other branches of engi-
neering had become important adjuncts
of both peace and war. Europe, too, had
been making advances, more especially
in the art of war. This fact was im-
pressed on the mind of the writer while
on a government engineering mission
thru Western Europe in 1914 and fol-
lowing the outbreak of World War I.
It was quite apparent to the observer
that all the skill of trained engineers
had been utilized to co-ordinate all facil-
ities of both defense and transportation.
Ordnance, both in France and Germany,
had been developed to limits far beyond
those formerly existing in previous wars;
aeronautics was rapidly advancing, and
chemical engineering had produced more
powerful explosives, and even poison

FURNACE WALLS
by
Robert W. Ehrlich '43E,
'I 'HE production of power in one of
■*■ our large power plants is a process
that involves a long series of steps from
the coal pile to the transmission lines,
and one of the important links in this
chain is the furnace in which combus-
tion is to take place. It is very easy
to talk about the details of the com-
bustion itself and forget the difficult
problem of creating a furnace structure
which will be able to hold its strength
and tightness through years of gruelling
high temperature service. It is a prob-
lem that involves a great deal of judg-
ment in balancing the factors of first
cost, maintenance, performance, and
capacity; one that is never permanently
solved.
It was early realized that proper de-
sign could help in furnace performance.
Certain clays having a rather high
alumina content were found to have
properties that would resist destruction
under heat, and these clays, called fire-
clays, were employed in making the
bricks to line the furnace walls. The
necessity for an arch to re-radiate and
concentrate the heat was also realized.
These old arches were built of wedge
shaped pieces of firebrick, and their
construction resembled that of the old
stone arches of ancient times. Such an
arch was called a "sprung arch," since
it held itself in position by being sprung
against the sidewalls of the furnace.
Even though the use of a sprung arch
improved furnace performance, furnace
temperatures still had to be held down.
After a few months of service the tile
in the arch would soften, and the whole
arch would collapse into the furnace.
A high replacement rate on sprung
arches was taken as a matter of course.
The arch is not the only part of a
furnace that can be expected to show
failure. Any brickwork that is exposed
to high temperature may fail as a result
of any one of five types of firebrick
failure; namely, melting, softening,
spalling, fluxing, and expansion. The
first, melting, is a problem that is very
seldom encountered except in applica-
tions where excessively high tempera-
tures are attained. The melting tem-
perature of good firebrick is around
3000 degrees Fahr., whereas the face
temperature inside a modern boiler will
rarely exceed 2800 degrees. In special
cases, such as the stoker grate line in
a furnace, it will be necessary to use
more expensive silicon carbide refrac-
tories which will not melt at tempera-
tures well above 3500 degrees.
Softening is a much more severe
problem, and it is one which causes a
great deal of the trouble. Prolonged
exposure to temperatures somewhat be-
low the melting point will cause the
brick to soften and lose its structural
strength. In furnaces whose walls were
laid up with firebrick and in the old
furnaces where the sprung arch depend-
ed for its support upon its own strength,
most of the failures were a result of
the softening of the brick and the con-
sequent loss of strength, causing col-
lapse of the structure.
Spalling is a condition that is usually
caused by mechanical failure as a result
of uneven expansions and contractions
that accompany thermal changes. It
is evidenced by particles of brick fall-
ing away, leaving a ragged surface. An
effect similar to spalling can be caused
by molten ash and clinker adhering to
the surface. On cooling, the clinker
contracts at a greater rate than the
brick, thus shearing of some of the sur-
face of the brick. Another cause for
spalling is the pinching of the fire ends
of the brick when insufficient expan-
sion space has been provided.
When firebrick softens and flows, it
is seldom due to melting but usually is
a result of a chemical combination of
the ash with the firebrick itself. The
ash acts as a flux, and causes the sur-
face of the brick to be washed away.
Such action, called fluxing, will con-
tinue until the wall is thin enough so
that radiation to the outside will cool
it sufficiently.
In the design of any furnace it is
very necessary to allow for the expan-
sion of the firebrick. Ordinary firebrick
will expand about one per cent when
heated to operating temperature, a small
factor but one which must be consid-
ered. A wall built without provision
for expansion will have trouble with
spalling and even shearing off the whole
face of the wall. Such conditions would
be particularly troublesome in gas and
oil fired furnaces where the temperature
can change quickly.
As the demand for increased steam
generation per cubic foot increased, it
was clear that some new principle would
have to be developed that would do
away with many of the troubles in-
herent in the solid wall and arch.
Around 1912, a successful approach
to the problem was brought forth, that
of the flat, or suspended arch. In this
type of construction, the tile were hung
individually from steel hangers, so that
no tile had to support more than its
own weight. A typical scheme used by
one manufacturer required the use of
tile with a T-shaped notch in the top.
These tile could be strung along the
lower flange of a small I-beam, each
piece hanging by itself.
Here then was the answer to the
softening problem in arch failures, for
if a brick lost its strength for some
reason and fell out, it did not cause
the whole arch to collapse. A missing
brick could be replaced much more
easily than a whole arch. Another
problem, that of spalling, was con-
10

duction of tile with a series of inter-
locking ridges and grooves in their
sides. These grooves caused the tile
to lock together while still retaining
the advantages of independent suspen-
sion. Furthermore, if the face of one
tile chose to spall, the adjoining tile
would hold it in place.
Not many years after the introduc-
tion of the suspended arch, it was
realized that the same principles could
be applied to the furnace walls to ad-
vantage: so the sectionally supported
wall was developed. The construction
of a sectionally supported wall involves
to a certain extent the same principles
that were used in the design of the
suspended arch. The tile are specially
designed with notches in them that will
accommodate cast-iron hangers. These
hangers, each of which supports not
more than 24 tile, are supported on a
steel framework which surrounds the
furnace. The result is that the wall
is built up of a number of independently
supported levels, or sections, of tile,
each not over 30 inches high. Between
the sections there run expansion joints
made of asbestos plastic which are de-
signed to take no load but merely to
allow for expansion and flexibility. By
using the interlocking groove principle,
the problems of spalling are overcome
as well as most of the other problems
mentioned previously in connection with
the solid type construction.
A corollary to the sectionally sup-
ported type of construction is that the
wall must be much thinner than the
old solid wall which was usually some
18 to 24 inches thick. Suspended walls
are seldom more than 12 inches thick,
and the air leakage through them is,
of course, much greater than through
a thicker structure. The groove and
ridge, or "treat", construction was
found to be effective in minimizing
air leakage by breaking up the air
passage.
The advantages of the sectionally
supported wall are many. Possibly the
principal advantage is its structural
reliability. No tile has to carry more
than the weight of the five or ten tile
immediately above it, consequently
there are practically no problems en-
countered with weakening of the tile at
high temperature. The expansion of
the tile is also readily cared for by
the inclusion of an expansion joint
between the sections. Maintenance is
also made easier, because it is possible
to replace individual tile from the out-
side of the furnace, or even to take a
whole layer of tile from the bottom of
the wall without having the rest of the
wall come down.
The first installation of sectionally
supported walls was made at Bingham-
ton, N. Y., in 1924. The unit was very
successful and showed a great drop in

along the rear of the wall, or by run-
ning some of the water tubes right
next to the face of the wall. Air cool-
ing is particularly adapted to suspended
walls; for, by proper shaping of the
cast iron hangers, some space can be
maintained between the back of the

maintenance. The many advantages
offset the higher first cost of a section-
ally suported wall, so much so that
practically all of the high tempera-
ture industrial furnaces of today are
equipped with these walls.
A factor of great importance in keep-
ing the face temperature of the tile
down is the cooling of the wall. This
wall and the outer masonry. Air that
is blown through this pasageway is
heated, so for greatest efficiency it is
used for air in the furnace combustion.
The depth of the refractory is an im-
portant factor in cooling, for if the tile
are too thick the heat transfer will be
impaired and the face of the tile will

fluorescence at war
Although the study of fluorescence
was carried on as early as 1852, its ap-
plications are ever expanding to prove
its versatility. As in practically every
other field of scientific endeavor, the
war is opening new horizons for the
fluorescent characteristics of "black
light".
For blackout protection in many large
cities fire plugs, curbings, signposts, and
innumerable other objects are painted
with luminous paint whose glow can be
seen clearly at 20 feet, but is indiscern-
ible at more than 100 feet.
For illumination during blackouts
small ultraviolet units are available
which emit, together with ultraviolet
rays, about 1 candlepower of visible
purple light.
In military intelligence fluorescence is
used extensively for invisible "ink". The
variety of fluorescent solutions is infin-
ite. It has been estimated that from
3,000 to 5,000 differ-
ent substances are
known which will
glow under ultravio-
let light.
As a life-saving de-
vice, a fluorescing
dye which glows
bright yellow in sun-
light is attached in a
container to life rafts.
When it is desired to
attract the attention
of passing aircraft, a
stopcock is opened
which releases the so-
lution. Since the dye
is dissolved in an oil
base, it spreads over
a wide area on the
water and can be
easily seen from the
air.
To aid tank manuevers, especially at
night, an intense beam of black light
can be projected from one tank to
another, thereby exciting fluorescent
signals within the tanks.
In cartography and documentary work
where reading is to be done under ad-
verse circumstances, maps and papers
can be rendered fluorescent by several
methods recently devised by army tech-
nicians.
crystal transmission
When, about 17 years ago, the federal
government established its regulations
on close control of radio transmitters,
an immediate demand for improved
transmitters was expressed throughout
the country. Existing transmitters were
incapable of the fine control now re-
quired by law.
The problem was solved promptly and
efficiently by crystal-controlled oscilla-
tors. Today this type of control is used
by all radio broadcasting stations and
its applications have expanded to in-
clude television transmitters, frequence
modulation transmitters, and radio re-
receivers.
The quartz crystals used come prim-
arily from Brazil arid are found in four
different forms: full prismatic, peak
prismatic, irregular, and river quartz.
The crystals are examined under arc
lamps for imperfections before cutting
because the highest grade quartz has so
many defects that little is usable.
The raw crystals are cut into hexa-
gonal pieces, then into bars. The cuts
are examined again under polarized
light, after which they are cut into
blanks.
The blanks are oriented by X-rays.
This method produces crystals whose
frequencies are constant to within 0.0001
per cent per degree Centigrade.
They are then ground and machine-
lapped to exact frequency, and finished
on test oscillators.
goggles
Now that the army is almost com-
pletely mechanized soldiers complain
less about their feet and more about
other parts of their anatomy. Foremost
on their gripe list at the beginning of
the war was their eyes.
The brass hats soon realized this and
began searching for an eye protector
which could be produced rapidly and
which would be applicable in all situa-
tions—from snow blindness in Russia
to sand storm irritation in Africa.

The goggles, held in place by an elas-

For protection against glare from the

The efficiency of these goggles is
matched only by the speed with which
they are being produced to protect our

unionmelt welding
A relative newcomer to the welding
field, a process tagged "Unionmelt" by
its developers is rapidly establishing
peaks in welding performance.
It is an electric process differing con-
siderably from the familiar arc-and res-
istance-welding processes in that there
is no visible arc and the current does not
flow between members to be joined.
Heat is obtained from the resistance of
weld rod, parent metal, and a substance
also called Unionmelt.
This third substance is a crystalline
compound which forms a protective
blanket over the weld. Operation is
begun with steel wool used as a fuse.

Modern Distillery Vats
distilleries
Modern distilleries, recently convert-
ed from peace-time to war-time alcohol
production, are rapidly emerging from
age-old processes to newer, more effi-
cient production methods.
One large distillery has completely
converted from batch to continuous op-
eration. From the time the grain leaves
the box cars, to the
time the refined al-
cohol is packed for
shipment, the in-
gredients are con-
tinually on the go.
When the grain
arrives, it is con-
veyed from the box
cars to a storage
bin after cleaning
and grading; then
through a magne-
tic separator and
rolling mill where
it is ground to
meal. The meal is
weighed and mixed
with water to form
a slurry. The slur-
ry is heated with mineral acid by means
of a steam jet under 165 pounds per
square inch. In this operation the starch
is gelatinized and converted to ferment-
able sugar. When it leaves the cooker, it
is neutralized with lime and the pressure
is reduced to atmospheric. The resulting
mash is then cooled to the fermenting
temperature and pumped into wells.
While this is going on, yeast also pre-
pared by a continuous process, is fed
into the ferment-
ers simultaneously
with the mash. Al-
though a fermen-
tation period of
from 20 to 24
hours is required,
the wells are con-
structed so that
new material can
be fed continuous-
ly into the top of
the fermenter.
The resulting
beer, containing 6
to 7^' alcohol, is
sent to the beer
well and fed into a
column where the
volatile material is
removed. The va-
pors thus removed
are fed to an alde-
hyde column where aldehydes, ketones,
esters and acids are removed.
The resulting beer, containing 6 to
7% alcohol, is sent to the beer well and
fed into a column where the volatile
material is removed.

Cart is an old TECHNIC man, hav-
ing been editor of the Publication De-
partment last year and having served
on the SLIDE RULE BALL Commit-
tee. Last year also found him president
of his fraternity,ThetaXi,whilehekeeps

cans, Phi Lambda Upsilon, and Phi Eta
Sigma keys also jingle jangle jingle for
him.

Carter Taylor
Since his father has a priority on
"Frank", Cart goes under F. Carter
Taylor rather than be called "Junior".
Rochester, N.Y., is his home town and
the reason for his going to school in
Ann Arbor. It being a strong Michigan
town and Michigan having a good Ch.
E. Department were reasons enough to
send Cart here. Rochester is also the
resting place for his hobby of photog-
raphy, which he left there when college
started.
His first two summers were spent
working, and this last one here in the
"summer term". Cart claims to have
done only school work then. Now he
has joined many of us with a bad case
of "senioritis", that peculiar disease that
attacks only seniors, and is having a
very enjoyable time making up for this
summer.
Carter believes the University has too
strong a hand in student affairs and
would like to see a more lenient policy
adopted. In particular he would bring
about the abolishment of that light over
the door at Mosher!
Although he is a departing senior,
Carter did not use this opportunity for
offering advice to the frosh. He merely
leered and said, "They will be told what
to do." When questioned about study
habits he replied that he does not have
them any more. However, now he does
know how one should study—exactly as
ADM told him to while he was a fresh-
man.
Upon graduation in February, he will
leave for Wilmington and Du Pont. Car-
ter will miss those morning classes of
his, for they were where he caught up
on the sleep that did not fit into the
previous evening.
d. c.
Donald C West, better known as D.
C. to his Union cronies, has been a
thorough-going engineer from the very
beginning. As a freshman he was na-
turally interested in the female situation
on the campus of 4 out of 5, so in con-
nection with the dating problem he ex-
hibited his inherent engineering instinct
by plotting a graph of progress made
with various and sundry coeds. Num-
ber of dates was plotted as abscissa
against what was equivalent to relative
enthalpy as ordinate.
Three cities claim Don as a native:
Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania, because
that's where the stork lost his grip
(some say Don gets his 3.9 average be-
cause he landed on his head during that
flight), Buffalo, New York, because he
attended high school at Amherst Cen-
tral, and West Field, New Jersey, be-
cause he lives there now.
In high school Don was elected to
National Honor Society and in his sen-
ior year held down the associate editor-
ship of the yearbook and was manager
of the swimming team. He also proved
that all potential engineers aren't illit-
erate by playing the leads in the junior
and senior class plays.

Donald C. West
At Michigan he is a B.M.O.C. among
B.M.O.C.'s. As a sophomore D. C. was
a tryout on the Technic and Union
staffs, but dropped the Technic to de-
vote his full time to the Union. The
fruits of his labor and ability (to quote
one Union associate, "efficient as hell")
have materialized as the presidency of
the Union, publicity chairman of the '42
Union opera, and membership on the
Student War Board, Men's Judiciary
Council, and Engineering Council.
Dangling from his key chain are evi-
dences of membership in Phi Eta Sigma,
Triangles, Vulcans, Mimes, Michi-
gamua, Tau Beta Pi, and Phi Lambda
Upsilon. On his fraternity pin (he still
has it) is the crest of Beta Theta Pi.
In February a certain sheep skin will
read "Donald C. West, Bachelor of

graduation, but rumor has it that he

SLIDE RULES
by
Blaine F. Newman, '43E
OUTSIDE of the few times that the
budding young engineer has seen
certain types of circular slide rules in
the show windows of the local stores, he
is entirely unfamiliar with the large
number of uses to which they may be
placed.
The ordinary type of slide rule has
long been the favorite tool of the engi-
neer. Still, unknown or forgotten by
many engineers are special purpose slide
rules, limited in their scope to the solu-
tion of a single equation which must be
the double slide and (3) the middle sup-
port. These three types are illustrated
in Figures 1, 2, and 3 and 4 respectively.
Each type is suitable for different types
of equations.
Let )(x) be denned as an expression
containing only the variable x\ for ex-
ample, V± log x, e*— log ;c-|-cos3x.
tanh 3/x
This is the customary algebraic defini-
tion of j(x).
Using this definition of j(x), the fol-
lowing types of equations may be solved
given equations into one of the forego-
ing type forms (1), (2), or (3).
Direction of Scales
When the type of rule required has
been determined, the direction in which
the values of the function will increase
(i.e., whether values increase to the right
or the left) must be determined. This
is a comparatively simple matter if the
following rules are observed:
1. Write the equation with all terms to
the left of the equal sign.

solved under different conditions over
functions themselves. When the func-
tions used are logarithmic, addition of
the functions is equivalent to multipli-
cation of the variables.
The major problems involved in lay-
ing out special slide rules are to find (1)
the type of rule necessary, (2) the direc-
tion in which the scales must run and
(3) the method of properly subdividing
the scales.
Type of Rule
Many types of combinations of fixed
and sliding scales are possible, but three
fundamental types are satisfactory for
most problems: (1) the single slide, (2)
Figures 1, 2

mentioned as shown below:

Examples of each type of rule are
given in this paper showing a typical
problem solved by each rule. Any one
term in the above equations may be re-
placed by zero, in which case an index
point replaces a scale. The addition of
a constant does not affect the status of
the equation. The use of an index point
is illustrated in Figure 4. Considerable
ingenuity is sometimes necessary to get

4. Draw arrows in the direction of the
sign prefixing the term, as written under
Rule (1).

increasing values of the function. It
should be noted that the order of in-

sunny clime
There was once a man who lived in
North Dakota. He had just bought a
new farm—so close to the border he
didn't know whether it was in the
United States or Canada. He had to
hire a party of surveyors to mark the
boundary. As it was a large farm,
it took them two weeks, but at last
they came in with the report that the
farm lay entirely on the southern side
of the border.
"I'm so relieved," said the man. "1
hear that the winters in Canada are
terrible."
ration ravings
Ho hum. Another day, another ra-
tion edict. This time it is canned goods.
Last time it was meat. Next week they
will probably ration ration coupons.
Fortunately, if you are the type that
worries about these things, you can
still get all the aspirin you want. That
won't go on the restricted list until
after the March income tax payments
are collected.

One nice thing about rationing is that
there are so many compensations for
the things we had to give up. They
took away our sugar; then to remedy
the inconvenience they took away the
coffee we put it in.
The new ration books are the acme
of simplicity. You have a certain num-
ber of points each month. Each item
of food costs, in addition to grocer's
fees, a certain number of points. Some
comodities will cost more points than
others. For instance, if you should buy
a T-bone steak, that will be all the
food you have all month. Don't be
afraid of starving to death, however.
The Bundles for America movement
will take care of you.
Since petroleum products are ra-
tioned, many motorists find themselves
dangerously short of gasoline. If you
are ever in trouble just go to your
corner drugstore or saloon and get a
Jersey Cyclone (recipe on request.) It
gives ten miles to the quart. Put it in
the gas tank or drink it. The result
is the same.
A large number of homes may be
cold this winter between the time that
the last oil coupon for one period is used
and the first one for the next period
becomes valid. In this case just put
anti-freeze in your radiators. After all,
as Mr. Lincoln said, you can't fuel
oil of the people oil of the time.
garg gags
You may perhaps recall that the
feud between the Technic and the Gar-
goyle was called off last Spring. Ever
since its founding, the junior publica-
tion has been taking editorial pot-shots
at the Technic, but as time went on
these verbal hemorrhages became so
feeble and pitiful that we could hardly
resist public display of our derision.
The Victor can afford to be generous
—we let them call it a draw if they
liked. And for our magnanimity and
charity what do we get? Stabs in the
back! They repeatedly print their lame
diatribes against the good name of the
Technic and of engineers in general.
But we will not descend to their level
and seek reprisal. We won't even stop
borrowing their rag. And the editors
are still welcome to come into our office
anytime to look at the joke pages of
the other engine school magazines in
our files. In fact, we think Mr. Kehoe

in last month—he found several which
he printed. Maybe he can find a few
good ones for next month's issue.
'Twas New Year's eve in Ann Arbor
—everybody was looking at the world
through rose-colored eyes. Some were
gay and some planned to go to class
on the morrow. In the latter group
were two junior lit students who never-
theless resolved to have a time of it.
Solemnly promising that they would not
miss their 8 o'clock class, they began
their evening in the afternoon.
The golden brew flowed like beer
always flows around here. At four
A.M. the Bell closed. Another hour
or two was spent in quiet concentration
on their private stock of potables. Then
came a council of war. "If we go to
sleep now we'll never get up," an-
nounced one. "Let's sleep in the class-
room," said the other. This was a fine
plan. They reeled over to the class-
room.

The wild oat crop suddenly came
into full bloom—the door was locked.
And they couldn't sleep in the hall—
who would wake them up? There was
only one course—stay awake until class
time.
With much difficulty they fought
against fatigue and hangover. En-
zymes and hormones competed to see
who could perform the weirdest chem-
ical reactions. By eight o'clock Lucky
Strike Green had returned from the war
and entered their faces. At this mo-
ment someone came and opened the
door. The stews staggered to their
seats and, as rigor mortis set in, watched
what the man was writing on the black-
board. "Prof. Brown will not meet his
eight o'clock today."

Watch out for these soldiers around
the campus, girls. They are too ac-
commodating. The other day one came
to the coke bar. He looked alone, so
a hostess asked if he would care to
dance. He said, "Sorry, I don't dance,
but I would be glad to hold you while
you do."

WHICH would qou vote "most likely to succeed?"
"The Aircraft Warning System gives a single
plane on ground alert the equivalent striking
power of 16 planes on air patrol." This start-
ling statement comes from England.
Our country's Aircraft Warning Service —
quite similar to England's—keeps a constant
check on the flight of all aircraft. Should the
need arise, it is prepared to send fighter planes
aloft, to mobilize and direct ground defense
forces, to warn endangered areas. Every step
in its operation requires the fast, accurate
communication of the telephone.
This is just one of the many wartime johs
that are keeping telephone lines busier than
ever before. To help us keep lines clear for
vital military and industrial calls, please

It was noted that in many lines of tech-
nical engineering and industrial produc-
tion of munitions, our own methods were
outdated, not because of lack of engi-
neering ability or skill in production,
but due to lack of incentive for produc-
tion of war materials.
Following the entrance of this coun-
try into the European conflict, the tempo
of American effort was accelerated, and
all the vast resources of the nation were
put into active use, the engineering skill
of all those following that profession
being utilized to the full extent of th"ir
abilities. The Civil engineer in France
designed and constructed bridges, rail
roads, docks, and numerous other facil-
ities so necessary to active warfare in a
foreign country. The aeronautical engi-
neer, then in its early stages, developed
and improved combat planes. The Chem-
ical Engineer developed and perfected
processes for manufacturing high explos-
ives, TNT, Ammonium Nitrate as pro-
duced at Muscle Shoals, Alabama, and
other points. The Sanitary Engineer,
from experience gained in past wars, de-
vised proper sanitation which prevented
great loss of life as had been experienced
in the Spanish-American war. The Me-
chanical and Electrical Engineer devel-
oped transportation equipment unsur-
passed at the time, so essential to the
rapid movement of military units. The
Marine engineer served his part in the
design and rapid building of all types of
ships, dry docks, and equipment con-
nected with ships at sea. As this coun-
try had not subscribed to the principle
of the use of the submarine in warfare,
little or no advance had been made in
the design or construction of submar-
ines.
At the close of World War I. a large
number of industrial plants and engi-
neering projects, which had been devel-
oped for the war were as rapidly as
possible returned to normal production
and use, or otherwise scrapped. In a
few cases some of these plants were
retained by the government, but were
allowed to remain in a more or less
dormant condition until the present
time. It was generally conceded, how-
ever, that the trained engineer had
occupied a more important part in World
War I than in any previous war, and
was admitted by the best authorities in
charge of war activities that the success
or failure in any subsequent war would

capacity of American engineers to cope
with the new progressive ideas as devel-
oped by other nations.
World War II.
The genesis of World War II has been
considered by many able historians as a
sequel or continuation of World War I.
Be that as it may, it found the United
States once more in a state of peace and
general prosperity. During the period
from 1918 to 1941, there had developed
innumerable inventions and perfections
in the science of both peace and warfare.
Engineering had expanded and devel-
oped many new lines of work; in fact to
such an extent that many good author-
ities term this present conflict a mechan-
ized war. Before actually becoming an
active participant in the present war,
time and opportunity to study the actual
use and efficiency of nearly all types of
mechanized equipment by the belliger-
ants, which afforded considerable infor-
mation in designing new equipment bet-
ter adapted for the purpose. Not even
the prosecution of World War I. involved
such a diversity of terrain, climatic con-
ditions, transportation of supplies, and
all the necessities for carrying on war
as does World War II.
The day of the "Charge of the Light
Brigade" has been transformed into the
charge of the mechanized tank brigade,
powered with destructive guns of large
caliber. In this type of equipment no
country should excell in both mechanical
perfection and hugh production than our
own, as the highly developed production
of all types of motorized vehicles has
produced the necessary engineering abil-
ity to turn out tanks equal to any yet
produced. The method of streamlined
or mass production of motor vehicles,
developed in this country, and now
adapted to the production of tanks,
planes, and many other lines of war
equipment, has demonstrated the engi-
neering skill of those engaged in me-
chanical engineering.
Many authorities submit that this
war will be won from the air, and the
use of planes for bombing, reconnais-
sance, and transportation of materials
and men, assists in substantiating that
claim. Thru the genius of our aero-
nautical engineers in design, and the
adaptation of mass production methods
to plane production, there is little doubt
as to the effectiveness of this arm of
warfare.

The terrific strain of modern war is testing
American mechanical equipment of all
kinds as it never has been tested before,
but it is coming through with flying colors.
For, among other vitally important things,
the designers of this equipment know
their bearings; that is why so many
Timken Tapered Roller Bearings are used in
tanks, trucks, armored cars, guns, airplanes,
warships and the machines that make
them. Timken Bearings meet every bear-
ing requirement because, in addition to
eliminating friction they carry radial, thrust
and combined loads and hold moving
parts in correct and constant alignment.
Timken Roller Bearings have been solving
bearing problems in industrial and trans-
portation equipmentfor many years—long
before the first world war. They will be
called upon more and more during the
reconstruction period that will follow
Victory for the United Nations in the
present conflict.
That is why you should begin now to
acquire a thorough knowledge of Timken
Tapered Roller Bearings — their de-
sign and application. When you have
this knowledge you will be able success-
fully to meet any bearing condition
you ever may encounter. Our engineers
will help you to get it. The Timken

get too hot, whereas a refractory that
is too thin will wear away and have
a shorter life. In present designs, the
tile are from 9 to 12 inches thick.
In certain applications the cooling
problem is not acute, and, in addition,
it may not be found economical to
install a complicated system of air ducts
and forced air blowers. In order to
keep down the losses without having
the wall thickness become too great,
insulation in the form of magnesia
compound blocks is applied to the rear
surface of the wall. The addition of
the insulation raises the temperature
of the wall up to the face of the insula-
tion, and it is usually found that special
means must be provided to cool the
castings, or heat resisting castings must
be used. For example, insulation is
often applied to the portions of the
walls behind the boiler tubes where the
temperature is lower and where it would
be rather difficult to construct air ducts.
Another approach to the problem of
cooling is the use of so-called water
walls. In this type of construction,
some of the boiler tubes are brought
down and placed along the surface of
the furnace walls themselves. Two pur-
(Continued from page 11)
poses are served: the presence of the
water keeps the temperature of the re-
fractory surface down, and at the same
time more tube surface is exposed
directly to the radiant heat of the
flame. The result is that there is a
tremendous increase in the liberation of
steam per unit of boiler tube area.
Water walls are made either with the
"bare tube" construction where the
tubes are placed against the surface
of the refractory, or with cast-iron
blocks that completely cover the face
of the tubes. It would seem that cast-
iron would melt under the severe con-
ditions; but it must be remembered
that the temperature of the water is
relatively low, and it keeps the blocks
at a low enough temperature. The ad-
vantage of using cast-iron facing is most
apparent in pulverized coal installations
where there is a great amount of molten
ash flying around. The cast-iron pro-
vides a smooth surface to which the slag
cannot adhere.
Water walls are expensive, and they
are not without their troubles, princi-
pally in connection with the feed
water supply. The evaporation rate
in a water wall tube is so great that
the slightest impurity in the water will
quickly leave a deposit on the inner
walls of the tube. Before long it will
be found that the tube is nearly clogged
up, and peculiar circulation conditions
will arise as a result. Large power
plants of today usually have adequate
water purifying equipment, and they
manage to use the water walls without
too much outage with clogged, or
"salty" boilers.
Other interesting problems have aris-
en in connection with the floor con-
struction in large furnaces. Coal ash
has a fusion temperature of around
2100 degrees, and in many installations
it is found convenient to let the ash or
slag settle to the bottom of the furnace
in molten condition, there to be drawn
off by a tap. When such a scheme was
first tried, it was found that some of
the floor came off with the slag, due to
fluxing action. Here was another cool-
ing problem, one that was solved for
some units by having water tubes placed
in the floor, covered by magnesite or
chrome insulation. In these and other
ways is the mechanical engineer con-
tinuously applying his technical knowl-
edge to construction of better furnaces.
SPECIAL PURPOSE SLIDE RULES
=l/z). Examples of the application of
these principles are shown below under
the individual equations for which slide
rules are illustrated.
Length of Scales
The length of scales is determined by
the range of values of the variables used
in constructing the scales. Since lengths
of the scales are proportional to the
values of the function, the range of
values is multiplied by a number m,
called the functional modulus, to obtain
the scale length. This functional mod-
ulus must be the same for all scales on
the rule, and its value is determined by
the function which has the greatest pro-
portional range of values. Stated mathe-
matically:
LI=m[F(x)-^(x)] (4)
where Lx is the length of scale for /(*)
in inches; m is the functional modulus
in inches of length per unit of the func-
tion; F(x) is the largest value of /(*);
and &lt;p(x) is the smallest value of f(x).
In laying out logarithmic scales, it
is convenient to have at hand a series of
logarithmic cycles of various lengths.
The above principles of construction
(Continued from page IS)
were utilized in the construction of the
rules illustrated in Figures 1 to 4. None
of the rules illustrated requires a slider.
The operation in each case is to match a
variable with another variable until the
final answer is read opposite the last
variable employed. As an example, in
Figure 2, one problem solved when the
rule is set is: K=0.14, U=1.S, ju=25,
C=1.5, Re= 10,000, giving h=500.
The means of constructing the slide
rules illustrated are discussed further
in some detail in order to afford greater
clarity to the method outlined above.
Example 1. Rule with single slide
(Figure 1). McAdams gives the equa-
tion h=(154+1.6t)XV0(,XD °- for
finding the film coefficient of heat trans-
fer for water flowing in turbulent flow
inside horizontal pipes. Here, h is the
coefficient of heat transfer in B.T.U.
per hr., per sq. ft., and per degree
Fahrenheit; V is velocity in feet per
second, based in a density of 62.3
pounds per cubic foot; D is the inside
diameter of the pipe in inches and t is
the temperature of water in degrees
Fahrenheit. I f we arrange this equation
following: log h+0.2 log D—log( 154
+ 1.6t)— 0.8 log V=0. (5)
This equation is of the form given in
Equation (1), so it may be represented
by a single slide rule.
Let us suppose that we wish to use
the rule for problems involving the fol-
lowing limits: 6&lt;D&lt;1 inch, 200&lt;t&lt;
40 deg. F., 5&lt;V&lt;0.5 ft. per sec., and
l,000&lt;h&lt;100 B.T.U. per hr., per sq.
ft., and per deg. F.
Applying Equation (4) to each of the
variables in turn, we obtain: L,=m(log
1,000—log 100)=m=13.0 in.; L„=
m(0.2 log 6.02S—0.2 log 1.049)=0.152
m=2.0 in.; Lv=m(0.8 log S—0.8 log
0.5)=0.8m= 10.4 in.; and L,=mIlog
(154 + 1.6x200)—log (154 + 1.6x
40)l=0.377m=4.4 in.
If a blank slide rule 14 inches long is
to be used and we wish to allow the
longest scale to run 13 inches, we may
by inspection evaluate w=13, since the
longest scale, from the above equations
is m inches long. This value of m gives
the scale lengths given on the right of
the above equations.

SLICING STEEL SLABS - and production schedules
STEEL billets were needed. Only
slabs were available. That was the
problem presented by expanded war-
time demands which had to be licked,
quickly. It was —by the process illus-
trated above. Ten oxyacetylene cutting
torches, mounted on a frame propelled
by two Airco Radiograph machines,
streak down the 140" steel slabs and
slice them into billets.
It's one of the many examples of
how American resourcefulness, teamed
with specialized knowledge, is making
minutes more productive. Oxyacetylene
cutting and welding and the electric arc
are blazing new trails to faster and
better production in almost every war
industry. The minutes, hours, even days
of production being gained by these
modern tools are now helping us to
overcome our enemies' headstart.
If you work with metals you should
know the complete story of the oxy-
acetylene flame and the electric arc—
their speed, efficiency and broad range
of usefulness in metal working. This
knowledge is vital today—invaluable in
the peace to come.

teresting uses of the oxyacetylene
flame and electric arc. Write for copy.

To obtain the direction of the scales,
we apply to Equation (5) the rules
given earlier, and obtain:
(a) -D + -* (b) ^ + D-
+ t * or &lt; t +
^-v+ +v-^
^ + h- -h + ^
Using Set (a), then, scales for V and h
may now be graduated by using a
logarithmic cycle 13 inches long. Values
of (154+1.6t) should be laid out,
since }(t) = 154 + 1.6t, but each grad-
uation should be marked with the cor-
responding value of t, not 154 + l-6t;
hD = 0.0223(Re)OR(CJL)O4) where h
k k
is the film coefficient of heat transfer,
in B.T.U. per hr., per sq. ft., and per
deg. F.; D is the inside diameter of the
pipe in feet; k is the thermal conducti-
vity in B.T.U. per hr., per sq. ft. and
deg. F., per ft.; u is viscosity in English
units (centipoises X 2.42); c is the spe-
cific heat in B.T.U. per pound per
degree F.; and Re is the Reynold's
number which is dimensionless.
To adapt this equation to slide rule
use, it is modified as completely as pos-
sible to l=(0.0225ReO8coV4k°")/hD
ameter, although laid out as feet actual
diameter by a similar method.
The scales were located on the rule
with reference to one another by calcu-
lating out one specific case as was done
in the previous example.
The rule shown in Figure 3 differs
from the one of Figure 2 only in the
exponent of the Prandtl number (c(.i)
k
in the equation on which it is based. In
the case of Figure 3, this exponent is
0.3.
Example 3. Rule with middle sup-
port (Figure 4). This rule illustrates

this makes the rule direct reading.
Values of D may be measured with a
log cycle 0.2 x 13 = 2.6 inches long. If
values plotted are those of actual inside
diameter of the pipe as determined from
tables, but the values are labeled as the
nominal diameter of the pipe, then the
rule will be direct reading for standard
pipe sizes. The V scale is laid out using
a logarithmic cycle 0.8x13=10.4
inches long.
One set of values must now be substi-
tuted into the original equation and a
solution obtained. After the scales are
graduated, they are glued to the slide
rule blank in such a manner that the
values substituted above are satisfied
throughout. The rule will then satis-
factorily solve all problems within its
range.
Example 2. Rule with double slide
(Figure 2). This rule solves the Dittus-
Boelter equation for finding the film
coefficient of heat transfer for liquids
being heated inside horizontal pipes.
This indicates the use of the double
slide rule. The equation involved is
Figures 3, 4
which, written in logarithmic form be-
comes:
log 0.0225+0.6 log k—log D+0.4log
u+0.4 log c+0.8 log Re—log h=0
This last equation is in the form of
equation (2), so a double slide rule is
indicated.
Limits chosen for the variables are:
0.15&gt;£&gt;0.05; 242&gt;u&gt;2.42; 100,000
&gt;Re&gt;i,000\ 0.5055&gt;D&gt;0.0874 (Std.
pipe sizes); 1.5&gt;c&gt;0.2; and 3,000&gt;
A&gt;100.
Using a functional modulus of 9, ob-
tained by the inspection method shown
in Example 1, Lk=2.6 in., LD=6.9 in.,
Lu=7.2 in., Le=3.2 in., Lk«.=11.0 in.,
and L, = 13.3 in.
Scales for k, D, u, Re and h increase
to the right, that for c increases to the
left.
By calculating values of u in terms
of centipoises, the scale for u was grad-
uated to read directly in centipoises by
a method analogous to that employed
in laying out the D scale in Example 1.
The D scale in this case was graduated
to read directly in inches nominal di-
the use of an index line and uniform
scales. The purpose of the middle fixed
scale is to accomplish a transfer of the
value of the function which it repre-
sents from one side of the rule to the
other. Thus, it is, in effect, two related
single slide rules on a fixed base. The
middle-support rule can solve two equa-
tions simultaneously, or may be used to
solve a single equation of more variables
than can be handled conveniently on
other types by the introduction of an
auxiliary variable. Introduction of an
auxiliary variable is used in this illus-
tration. The scale for this auxiliary
variable is always graduated, but is not
usually calibrated.
The equation qr=hrA(T8—Tr) is
solved by the rule illustrated in Figure
4, where qr is the heat lost, B.T.U. per
hr. and linear foot of pipe; hr is the
coefficient of radiant heat transfer, in
B.T.U. per hr., sq. ft. and deg. F.; A is
the external area, sq. ft. per ft. length
of pipe; Tg is the surface temperature
of pipe, in deg. F.; and Tr is the tem-

flimsy crates of World War 1 needed over-
hauling after as little as 24 flying hours.
But today's planes fly hundreds of hours at
much higher speeds before a major overhaul.
The reason? New materials, new designs and new
methods of finishing metal surfaces. Finishes
so nearly perfect that bearings, cylinders,
pistons and cams are made practically wear-
proof! It's a process in which Carborundum
has played an important part...by supplying
the finishing wheels and stones required.
Formerly ultra-finishing was a long
tedious task. But thanks to the new
process, finishes accurate to a few
millionths of an inch can now be pro-
duced on ground surfaces on a produc-
tion basis. Application of these
finishes to wartime engine production
has improved the fighting efficiency
not only of planes, but of tanks and
other motorized equipment. Fewer men
are needed for maintenance and repair.

perature of the room, in deg. F. The
auxiliary variable k is introduced to
make the equation suitable for slide
qr=Ts-T=k. Or,
log qr—log hr—log A=log k ( 7a)
T -T =k (7b)
Equations (7a) and (7b) are of the

form of Equation (3), which shows
that the original equation can be rep-
resented by a middle support rule.
Considering (7a) and (7b) separate-
ly, individual single slide rules are now-
plotted on the lower and upper portion
of the rule. The scales for k on both
the lower and upper parts of the rule
should be made to increase in the same
direction.
The same functional moduli need not
be used on both the upper and lower
halves of the rule. As shown, a modulus
of 1/30 is used for the upper half of
the rule and a modulus of 5 for the
lower half. The index point is located
by means of a calculation so that it
reads correct values on the upper k
scale when set on values of T, and Tr.
Lines are now drawn connecting
equal values of k on the upper and
lower k scales.
The operation of the rule is as fol-
lows: Set values of Tr opposite the
corresponding values of T,. Set hr op-
posite the value on the lower k scale
indicated by the index point on the
upper k scale. (The lines connecting
the two k scales are to assist in this
step.) Opposite the value of D read the
corresponding value of q,. In the rule
shown in Figure 4, the variable A does
not appear but, since it is a function of
D, the value of D is used, thus eliminat-
ing the necessity of calculating A for
any given D.
The above examples serve to show the
general applicability of special slide rules
to chemical engineering problems. The
method of construction is simple and
direct. Any points in the above discus-
sion that are not immediately clear may
be most readily cleared up by perform-
ing the operations necessary to construct
a simple rule. Suitable slide rules may
be made from cardboard, hard rubber,
wood or any other material at hand.

make it resistant to chemicals and heat,
strong and hard to withstand impact and
abrasion, accurate to tolerances ranging
as low as 0.00002 of an inch.
This knowledge is being put to good use
today. A special sanitary glass piping,
for example, has just been developed to
ease the dairy industry's shortage of
metal. The communications industry,
faced with a sudden wartime de-
mand for insulators in intricate
shapes and with special electrical
characteristics, is using glass insu-
lators quickly developed by Corning.
Design engineers who are licking this
war's problems are finding ever new
uses for glass. For tomorrow's engineers
also, glass is the material with unlimited
possibilities. Industrial Division, Corn-

Prof. Rainville used to play quite a
bit of poo], although he has not had
time to indulge recently. He did splurge
about a year ago when he spent a week
showing some of his students the finer
points. Turning from mathematics, he
spends most of his leisure time reading
fiction, non-fiction, and poetry. In fact,
Prof. Rainville has published more poe-
try of his own than he has math papers.
The poetry came when he "was young
and foolish, and it is fortunate that none
of the stuff is available now.''
Since he is "one of those strange peo-
ple who believe they should buy a house
before a car", Prof. Rainville rides a
bicycle to and from the campus. His
overcoat determines whether or not he
uses the bike—if the Ann Arbor climate
calls for the coat, he busses. If not, he
rides. He almost missed a Math 57
final last spring when a truck almost did
not miss him!
While at the University of Colorado,
some of the profs became interested in
his phenomenal memory and gave him a
series of memory tests. Everything went
well and he was breaking all records—
until he forgot to go to one of the tests!
Sigma Rho Tau settled its Tung Oil
Crown on him one year, and Triangles
have taken him into membership. He
is rated "tops" by his students, and it
is a pleasure to have math dished up by
him.

If he's not in the Technic office, or
teaching classes, or attending any one
of a variety of meetings, or tinkering
with his radio; you can usually find
Ken Moehl hustling the suckers in an
innocent game of pinnochle. It's all for
the best, though, because his passion
for the game keeps him out of such
places as the Liberty Street Grog
Shoppe which, to many students, is the
only retreat for a weary mind.
Ken was born at an early age, which
probably accounts for his mental and
technical ability. He attended Detroit's
Cass Tech and there became interested
in radio. As his interest mounted he ob-
tained an amateur license and devoted
every spare minute to the building, re-
pairing, and operation of his sets until
one day his head was turned by a Mar-
tha Cookie. His call letters, WAPUF,
have inspired several select nicknames
from radio acquaintances, only one of
which—"Puff"—will be mentioned here.
In the honor society and activity de-
partments, Ken is at the top. He an-
swers to the rolls of Tau Beta Pi, Eta
Kappa Nu, Iota Alpha, Quadrangles,
American Institute of Electrical Engi-
neers, and Institute of Radio Engineers.
He started as a sophomore on the
Technic and, through the features de-
partment, worked up to the assistant
editorship. On top of this load which
would smother an ordinary person, Ken
teaches an E.E. 2A lab section and a
signal corps study hall, and works for
engineering research.
Ken takes his notes on an 8V2 x 11
clipboard and files them in old magazine
li I*"
W
Ken Moehl
envelopes every month. Forgetting to
file every day's notes, he has to allocate
one day each month for reorganization,
meanwhile stacking them in convenient
places, such as the floor. Last fall, one
fellow looked into his room and asked
him when he's going to unpack, after
he'd been there all summer. After
graduation in May, unless Uncle Sam
has different plans, Ken hopes to apply
his training in electrical engineering to
industrial electronics.
Ken's stock in trade is practical jokes,
but usually he only thinks of the an-
tagonizes and lets someone else carry
out the details. His philosophy can be
summed up in two bits of advice. To
freshmen: the same advice all freshmen
receive but never. follow. To gay Lo-
tharios: Never let love get mixed up
in your love affairs.

PROBLEM
The Good Cereal Company needs
nine large drying units for a difficult
drying process in the production of corn
Hakes. The Ace Drier Company be-
lieves they could build the driers, but
it would first require considerable re-
search. The two ccmpanies make a
gentleman's agreement, whereby the
Ace Drier Company, for the next five
Cereal Company, who in turn will buy
years, sells these driers only to the Good
nine of these driers as they ar2 pro-
duced. After considerable time on the
problem, involving large research costs,
the Ace Drier Company completes a
drier for the cereal company. However,
all the costs of research were not added
to the cost of this first drier, but only
1 9 of the research costs were added.
The remaining 8 9 of the research costs
are to be added in equal amounts to the
cost of the following eight driers. This
allocation of research costs naturally
decreased the cost of the first drier.
The first drier is delivered and in-
stalled in the Good Cereal Company,
and they pay their bill promptly. The
Ace Drier Company immediately starts
production on the remaining driers.
However, after a few months of success-
ful operation of the drier, the Good Ce-
real Company refuses to let the Ace
Drier Company service the drier, and,
in fact, refuses to allow any employee of
the Ace Drier Company to enter that
part of the factory where the drier is
operating.
After some time, the Ace Drier Com-
pany learns from reliable sources that
the Good Cereal Company does not in-
tend to buy the remaining eight driers,
but plans to duplicate and construct in
their own shops the one drier they
bought.
What action, if any, would you ad-
vise the Ace Drier Company to take?

FLAMES THAT CUT TIME!
TODAY, ships are needed as never before. And today,
ships are being built as never before . . . and built faster,
stronger, and with less steel . . . thanks to welding!
But before welding can take place, steel plates have to have
their edges beveled and squared-up so that, when butted to-
gether, they look like this: "~~X ~ or like this: ~K^T~~~-
In the past, preparing plates in this manner was done by
heavy machine tools. Cutting was slow and costly. Each plate
had to be handled many times. Plate cutting on this basis
co uld hardly keep pace with welding today.
Now, oxy-acetylene flames . . . culling in different planes
simultaneously . . . prepare the edges of steel plates of any com-
mercial thickness at one pass ... in a fraction of the time re-
quired by mechanical methods!
This Linde flame-planing method is as simple as ABC. It is
economical . . . and easy to use. It cuts plates so smoothly and
accurately that no machining is necessary! And it uses materials
which can be produced in abundance.
On-thc-job power requirements for flame-shaping arc neg-
bgible ... for the reaction of the cutting oxygen jet with the
hot steel does all the work . . . and only fractional horsepower
is required to move the cutting nozzles along the line of cut.
In conjunction with "Uuionmelt" Welding ... an amazing
electrical welding process that unites plates of any commercial
thickness faster than any similarly applicable method . . . like
this V"~ . . . the Linde method of plate-edge preparation
is working miracles in speeding up shipbuilding.
These two methods are also helping to break production
records in other fields. Great pressure vessels . . . locomotive
boilers . . . huge pipes . . . heavy chemical tanks . . . combat tanks
. . . artillery mounts . . . and other vital equipment are being
turned out faster because of them.
Linde research, intensified today, is constantly solving new
problems in flame-cutting, flame-fabricating, and flame-con-
ditioning of metals for war production.
The important developments in flame-cutting — and other processes
anil methods used in the production, fabrication and treating of

THE POST-WAR ENGINEER
T'HEengineer's place in this post-
war world is one of measurable
importance. For it will fall upon him
to assume the responsibility of ap-
plying his technical training for the
advantage of world society. He will
be called upon to take a hand in the
program of immediate rehabilitation
and reconstruction followed by a pro-
gressive, far-sighted plan to improve
the social welfare of all peoples in all
countries irrespective of differences in
physical characteristics, religious
convictions, or political attitudes.
For this job we have the natural
resources, the industrial capacity,—
but not the most propicious attitude.
That, engineer, describes you. For
you with your highly specialized
training, with your traditional con-
servativeness and lack of awareness
of the changing social and political
world about you, with your concern
with things and not people are in-
capable, as yet, of assuming this
leadership that society demands.
In connection with this character-
istic of the engineer, I am reminded
of the definition contained in Web-
ster's following the word engineer-
ing: "Originally the art of managing
engines; now the science and art by
which the properties of matter and
the sources of power in nature are
made useful to man in structures,
machines, and manufactured prod-
ucts." Notice the distinction between
engineering originally and engineer-
ing now.
No longer is engineering the man-
agement of engines alone. By its
technical advancement and resulting
utility to society, it is becoming a
necessary and integral part of that
society. It is impossible to segregate
any longer the engineer from his po-
litical and social environment.
The distribution of power, the
management of industry, the phas~s
of transportation and communication,
to name a few, although often ad-
ministered by engineers, are too inti-
mately connected to the social struc-
ture to permit the mismanagement of
by technically trained experts ignor-
ant of the human element involved.
And yet we are doing absolutely
nothing to bring about any change in
this retrogressive policy. The univer-
sity, the birthplace of the engineer, is
sadly negligent in providing the engi-
neer with the necessary non-technical
education that will enable him to as-
sume responsible leadership.
That such a situation admittedly
exists is disconcerting, indeed. But
that no one in the driver's seat seems
to want to take the initiative neces-
sary to institute a change in this
policy is more than disconcerting.
There is this that can be done. In
every engineer's program, there is
specifically allocated room for a num-
ber of non-technical electives. The
choice of courses is left to the indi-
vidual, as a result of which too many
pipe courses are elected without re-
gard for their merit. In place of this
aimless attempt to indoctrinate the
engineer with a smattering of culture,
there should be immediately insti-
tuted in the current curricula a plan-
ned group of courses in sociology, po-
litical science, and economics that
will better prepare the engineer to
cope with the problems he will meet
as a member of organized society.
And after the demands for imme-
diately trained engineers are over,
there must be instituted a pre-profes-
sional period of at least two years.
Only by such a course of action can
the colleges and universities graduate
engineers who will have some grasp
of the living world about them and
their relation to that world.

Single-cylinder aircraft-engine test stands in one air-
craft engine plant are helping to speed production,
while contributing to improvement in engine parts,
and, consequently, to power plant performance.
These stands duplicate a regular, full-sized, 9 cylin-
der radial engine, except that eight of the cylinders
have been removed and the drive shaft, instead of
spinning a propeller, exerts its force against a brake
mechanism for registering horsepower. With these
single cylinders, engineers run tests on pistons, spark
plugs, valves, piston rings, piston pins, intake and
exhaust ports and cooling fins. Tests of hundreds of
variations and combinations are run quickly, saving
not only the expense of operating a complete engine,
but also valuable days of test time, and releasing the
regular test cells for production use on full-sized en-
gines. In addition, a test on a specific part can be run
to the point of failure with the single-cylinder stands.
Design features in the cylinder and its component
parts can be tested, modified, rejected, improved or
approved before constructing a full-scale engine
model for extensive ground and flight tests. Also,
troubles cropping up in service engines can be re-
lentlessly pursued.

... Centrifugal castings that are not
symmetrical can be made by counter
balancing the mold. This improvement
now makes possible the casting of air-
plane landing-gear pivots. The old
method, building up by welding, re-
quired 18 separate pieces of steel plate
and IS feet of welding seams. The built
up welded pivot is also three pounds
heavier than the new centrifugal casting.
... Plastics are fast replacing iron and
steel badly needed for machines of war.
A thermoplastic resin is being manufac-
tured into pipes which will not burn and
can withstand temperatures up to 175
degrees F. Other advantageous charac-
teristics of this material are its ability
to resist freezing and its toughness. An-
other useful property is the ease with
which it can be welded. All that is
needed to join two pieces is a plate
heated to 350-400 degrees F. The two
pieces of pipe are held against the side
of the plate until the plastic becomes
molten and then they are placed to-
gether. The resulting joint is stronger
than the pipe itself.
... The Great Lakes ore steamers car-
ried 103,125,995 net tons in 1942. This
tops the all time high established in
1941 by 14.93%.
... American industry has been asked
to use secondary copper where ever pos-
sible instead of electrolytic metal. The
reason for this is America faces a likely
25% shortage of copper. In 1942, 2,600,-
000 tons of copper—&amp;% under the re-
quired amount—were produced. This
year the shortage will be increased be-
cause of the rapidly expanding demand
by the armed forces.
...The 1942 ship production goal has
been reached. In one year American ship
yards have produced 8,090,800 tons of
merchant shipping. Of the total 746
ships, 542 were Liberty ships, 62 tank-
ers, 62 C type, 55 cargo ships for the
British, 5 coastal freighters, 5 ore
freighters, and 15 special types. If pres-
ent production rates are maintained,
American shipbuilders will turn out 14,-
400,000 tons or over 4 ships per day in
1943.

IN only a few seconds the oxyacetylene
■ flame adds greatly to the service life
of this internal gear. Teeth and other
surfaces subject to wear are rapidly
hardened by the modern oxyacetylene
flame treating process. The depth of
hardening is easily and accurately con-
trolled, without affecting the inherent
toughness of the core metal.
Airco Flame Hardening gives all the
advantages of other surface hardening
method s plus speed and ease of appli-
cation. Simple arrangements using one
or more torches permit flame harden-
ing of a large variety of metal parts
on a production basis.
Many other applications of the oxy-
acetylene flame are finding ever widen-
ing application in speeding and im-
proving production of ships, tanks,
guns, rolling stock and planes. This
versatile tool slices through steel with
remarkable speed —welds metal into
strong, light units —sweeps surface rust
from metal structures to extend the life
of paint jobs —gouges steel and iron
quickly and accurately.
To better acquaint you with the
many things that this modern produc-
tion tool does better we have published
"Airco in the News", a pictorial re-
view in book form. Write for a copy.

... In important machine work, such as
on turbines, a ratchet wrench that goes
out of action when the maximum tor-
sional strain has been reached is used
to tighten bolts. This process always
developed torsional strains and the fol-
lowing method was conceived to elimi-
nate this difficulty. First, the nut is
tightened on the cold bolt until it is
snug. Then a 110 volt electric heater is
inserted in a hole that has been drilled
thru the axis of the bolt. In about
fifteen minutes a three inch bolt elon-
gates enough to allow the mechanic to
tighten up the nut. On cooling the bolt
contracts, the amount of tension being
controlled by the heating period.
... Tellurium, which was often frowned
upon by sensitive foundrymen because
of its offensive, garlic-like odor, is now
being used to chill gray iron. Prevously,
chromium was used in idler wheels for
tractors, which contain about 0.50%.
With the loss of sufficient chromium,
ferro-tellurium is used in the ratio of
two ounces to two thousand pounds of
iron. This small amount of ferro-tellur-
ium produces a % inch rim of white cast
iron. Amounts as little as 0.005% in
iron will spoil its machinability.

The battery, a functional part of certain types of communi-

Polystyrene) is now being used for these purposes because
it provides all the essentials and, in addition, offers definite
advantages over the materials that it supplants.
Exceptional electrical properties which make STYRON a
remarkably effective insulating medium—extraordinary resist-
ance to chemicals—high impact strength—light weight—these
are some of the distinctive characteristics of this crystal-clear
molding material that are of great assistance to battery
makers. Thus in the field of electricity, as in many others,
plastics are making a genuine contribution.

FEBRUARY, 1943


By
EDMUND H. MERZ, '44E
THE history of the development of
cellulose nitrate as a commercial
plastic is replete with the romance of
research, and because of the inherent
properties of the substance, many men
lost their lives or had their health
broken in the battle to perfect this ma-
terial. But today the manufacture of
the standard forms of cellulose nitrate
ready for fabricating is a well controlled
and successful enterprise.
The base of this plastic is cellulose.
By far the largest source of this cellu-
lose is cotton, although most nitrate
lacquers use a wood pulp base. The
cotton linters are digested with dilute
sodium hydroxide, cleaned, boiled,
scrubbed mechanically and magnetically
until all impurities such as sand, seeds,
and tramp iron are removed. This cel-
lulose is then mixed with weighed
amounts of nitric and sulfuric acids for a
rigidly controlled length of time at a
definite temperature. This nitration is
the most ticklish part of the whole pro-
cess. The summarizing equations are:
2[C,H7(OH)3] +6HN03^
[C,HT02)2 (NO,).] + 6H20
This is guncotton.
By boiling in water:
[(C6H7O2)2(NO3)0] + H,0-*
[CAOa)s(NQ,)te(OH),] + *HN03
about 11% nitrated.
The slurry is washed and rewashed for
about 4 days. The water in the slurry
of nitrated cellulose is then pressed out
and alcohol is shot into the matted
"cake" to remove the last vestiges of
entrained water. The analysis of the al-
cohol wet pyroxylin as it comes from
the dehydrator is 30% by weight resi-
dual solvent.
This pyroxylin cake is then dumped
into a nickel steel mixer, camphor (the
plasticizer) and more alcohol (the sol-
vent) is added and the mass is thor-
oughly mixed by the huge blades for 30
minutes. Pigment or dies can be added
in the mixer or later on the rolls. The
pasty, doughy mass is then extruded
through balloon cloth faced dies. This re-
moves minute particles such as soot, bits
of metal from the machines, sediment
from the washing water, etc. In the mix-
ing and straining operation, the plastic
mass has lost considerable solvent.
The bulk is then transferred to a roll-
ing mill, which looks like a washing
machine wringer, but weighs appreciably
more, several tons in fact. As the ma-
terial is rolled and squeezed, all particles
are colloided, thus pigment can be added
quite effectively on the rolls. After the
rolling process, the material analyzes
7-8% residual solvent. The rolled slab
is then locked into a binder and heated
in a press by low pressure steam while
a pressure of 60 psi is applied to the
surface of the cake. During the baking
process the material homogenizes and be-
comes a block of solid bulk with no
floor and the horizontal knife edge can
be varied by thousandths of an inch,
and as that distance is varied, sheets of
any given thickness can be sliced neatly
off the top of the cake.
These sheets are then hung in a dry-
house; they are dull, striated, warped,
seven weeks, depending as the gage
varies from .003" to .250". During the
drying process, the last vestiges of sol-
vent and plasticizer, not actually held
in the molecular lattice is eliminated.
When the sheets are taken from the dry-
house, they are dull, striated, warped,
and without luster.

striations or inclusions. After storing in
an icehouse for two days to allow the
material to "set" and harden, the cake
is swung onto a special table, the bottom
plate of the binder bolted there, and
the binder knocked off. The bottom of
the plate has dovetailed grooves into
which the cake has flowed during bak-
ing. This assures a firm bond between
cake and table. The necessity of this
bond becomes apparent when one sees
this table leap into life, surge against a
knife blade 20" long, and watches the
shaving curl off the cake. The table
then backs from the knife, and a new
run is started. The distance between the

sheet can be peeled off the plate. The

SURFACE FINISHES

iO*Jb£ ytvJuX4*^^_
Walter Mikclson, development engi-
neer for the General Electric Company,
was born in Altoona, Pennsylvania, in
1913. He graduated from the University
of Michigan in 1934 with the degree of
Bachelor of Science in engineering
physics. He has since been engaged in
developmental work in G. E.'s sound
and acoustic laboratories.
Mr. Mikelson is a member of the
Acoustical Society of America. A violin-
ist, he also is chairman of the Schnec-
tady Symphone Orchestra Association.
He is a writer of technical articles, and
was co-author of a paper which received
the A.I.E.E. District 1 prize as the
best paper for 1940.
THERE is a widespread need at the
present time for a practical, rapid,
and reliable method for the designation
of machined surface finishes from both
the design and production viewpoints.
Raw materials and completed products
must be manufactured in larger quan-
tities than ever before with no sacrifice
in quality. This turn toward more effi-
cient national production and toward
making the greatest possible use of our
present production facilities means that
manufacturers who were heretofore en-
tirely independent, are now co-operating
and working together toward the com-
mon end of producing satisfactory prod-
ucts in the least possible time. Engi-
neering ideas are exchanged, production
facilities are combined, and the subcon-
tracting of machined parts is wide-
spread.
The successful completion of a man-
ufactured product having particular
By
WALTER MICHELSON, *34E
surface finish requirements depends to
a considerable extent upon clear under-
standing of surface finish requirements
between manufacturers, and between
engineering, designing, and production
groups in any one manufacturing plant.
One approach which has been used for
the past ten years, is that of describing
these finishes with the aid of actual
finish specimens. Not only has this
method been found valuable in main-
taining quality at low cost in production
equipment in the past, but now, more
than ever, its value has become apparent.
The performance of a machined sur-
face from the finish viewpoint depends
upon the dimensional characteristics of
the surface irregularities. These char-
acteristics can vary considerably and
depend both upon the material and upon
the method of finishing used. The most
important characteristics are:
1. Surface roughness
2. Surface waviness
3. Direction or irregularities in the
surface plane
4 pattern of both types of irregu-
larities
5. Surface profile
6. Contact area with mating parts
As defined by the Proposed American
Standard on "Surface Roughness,"
"surface roughness" is the rms height
of the surface irregularities whose peaks
are closer together than 1/32 inch; and
"surface waviness" is the height of
deviations whose peaks are farther
apart than 1/32 inch. The other terms
are believed to be self-explanatory.
Instruments are now available which
can be used to measure some of these
characteristics and these should aid
materially in obtaining much needed
data on surfaces and their behavior. Of
these, the most widely used are stylus
or needle-type instruments which meas-
ure surface roughness as defined above.
Although these instruments have proved
themselves valuable when properly used,
their use in production has in some
cases led to the misconception that sur-
face finish and surface roughness are
synonymous.
The performance of a surface, how-
ever, depends not only on the roughness
but to some extent on each of the several
dimensional characteristics mentioned
which describe the finish. The relative
importance of each is dependent to a
large degree on the use to be made of
the surface.
Although little quantitative data are
available and much more research work
must be done on the effect of different
finishes on performance, significant re-
sults have been obtained by a few ex-
periments in the field. Dayton, Nelson,
and Milligan have obtained results on
bearing performance of journals varying
in roughness from 1 to 10 microinches,
and these investigators observe no con-
sistent correlation between performance
and roughness.

blasted journal was compared with a
polished and ground journal of one-
third the roughness. When tested in an
Almen machine, the grit-blasted journal
was found to take three times the load
of the ground specimen without seizing.
Schurig also describes oil-lubricated
bearing surfaces, dry rubbing surfaces
such as collector rings on electric gen-
and erosion. The susceptibility of ma-
terial to fatigue failure is likewise
considerably affected by many of the
characteristics of the surface finish.
Practical instruments are not yet
available which adequately measure all
dimensional characteristics of a surface.
More research work remains to be done
before the importance of these charac-
teristics to the performance of surfaces
There are ten degrees of roughness,
varying in 2-to-l steps from 4 to 2000
microinches rms. Each symbol may ap-
ply to one or more sample finishes, but
all are machined to the same roughness
on a metal specimen block, to illustrate
differences in surface characteristics en-
countered in practice.
For example, two surfaces are repre-
sented on the smoothest specimen, one

erators, stationary contact surfaces, and
joints in which the various dimensional
characteristics of a surface assume dif-
ferent degrees of importance.
Tests made by Shaw suggest that a
smooth surface is not always better than
a rough one and base this conclusion
on load-carrying tests of metal-sprayed
steel shafts having a porous surface com-
pared with hardened steel shafts.
Wulff points out that surfaces of the
same material, finished by different
methods but all measuring two micro-
inches root - mean - square roughness,
sometimes behave differently with re-
spect to strength, friction, corrosion,
can be evaluated. In the meantime,
some simple, practical method is needed
to specify surfaces in design and pro-
ductiorf in a way which takes into ac-
count as many of the characteristics
involved as possible.
One system makes use of same gage
specimens. In many respects it is similar
to the system that has been announced
by the Army Ordnance Department ex-
cept that the symbols describing the
specimens designate a specific value of
surface roughness, rather than a wide
range of values for various applications.
The symbol used is an "f" with an
attached number, for example, f,1 f,2 f.3
of which is lapped, the other honed.
The complete set of gage specimens is
shown in Fig. 1.
These specimens are available to de-
sign engineers, draftsmen, shop mechan-
ics, and inspectors. They are used:
1. To indicate to the design engineer
and to the draftsman the smoothness
and appearance of various degrees of
finish, and to permit the selection of
an exact degree of smoothness for the
functional purposes intended.
2. To enable the shop mechanic to
visualize the degree of roughness desig-
nated on a drawing.

CRUDE RUBBER
A LTHOUGH only thirty-seven out of
■**• more than two hundred and
twenty different trees that contain rub-
ber or rubber-like substances are of any
industrial importance, a discussion of the
processing of rubber from more than one
type would involve a paper of unwieldy
proportions. Therefore, the latex from
the most important rubber yielding
plant, the hevea tree, has been selected
to illustrate the various steps in the
manufacture of crude rubber. The proc-
esses involved are representative and
with a few modifications are indicative
of rubber processing from other industri-
ally important trees.
Most of the labor and control in the
processing of crude rubber is handled
by natives and plantation owners who
for the most part have had little techni-
cal training. Therefore, until quite re-
cently, the quality of rubber produced
was simply a result of past experience.
Characteristics of the Hevea Tree
The most important plant from the
standpoint of rubber production is the
hevea tree. This species has dominated
the world market for the past thirty
years. Hevea, as well as other important
rubber producing trees, grows only in
a limited equatorial zone within the
tropical circles. Malaya, the most im-
portant rubber producing country, has
two and one-quarter million acres—
forty-seven percent of the total world
acreage—devoted to the growth of the
hevea tree. The Dutch East Indies is
second with thirty-four percent, followed
by Ceylon, Borneo, Sharawah, India,
French Indo-China, and Brazil.
The tree itself usually grows to a
height of about ninety feet and has a
circumference of approximately eight
feet. Inside the tree are large numbers
of tubes of capillary dimensions running
from the roots to the leaves. These
tubes which are usually found in or near
the bark of the tree carry the latex from
which the rubber is extracted.
The Latex
Latex, a milky substance with a spe-
cific gravity which varies between .978
and .987, contains what is commonly
called the rubber hydrocarbon. This is
By
C. STEWART JOHNSON, '43E
the desired constituent. Rubber occurs
in the latex in the form of small particles
which are approximately spherical in
shape. Although these particles are too
minute to be seen under the ordinary
microscope, it has been determined that
they vary widely in size. The hevea tree
produces a yield which contains approx-
imately 200,000,000 rubber particles per
cubic centimeter in a 30% latex solu-
tion. The size and shape of the particles
varies somewhat with the age of the
plant. An older tree will generally have
produced large particles often character-
ized by tail-like appendages.
The liquid or serum surrounding the
rubber particles is extremely complicated
in structure. It contains a colloidal sus-
pension of organic compounds such as
proteins and resins together with dis-
solved sugars and mineral salts. The
exact botanical significance of latex, in
spite of extensive study, has not yet
been determined.
Collecting the Latex
In order to understand the conditions
under which the latex is received and
made ready for processing, a knowledge
of how it is gathered from the trees is
necessary. To obtain latex the tree is
tapped by means of a V-shaped or diag-
onal slit cut in the bark. This cut severs
a number of capillary tubes from which
the latex flows. The liquid runs down
to the vertex of the V or to the lower
end of the diagonal cut where it is re-
ceived in a small cup. When the flow of
latex ceases, the residual liquid dries
and seals the cut. The product from
each tree is then collected and taken to
a hut for smoking or stored in tanks
prior to other types of processing.
To avoid contaminating the latex, the
cups, when not in use, are left unwashed
at the base of the trees. When the next
tapping occurs, the thin film of rubber
which has hardened above the liquid is
pulled out leaving the cup perfectly
clean.
The tree is usually tapped about SJ4
feet above the ground, and the slit ex-
tends from one-quarter to two-thirds of
the way around the circumference of
the trunk. Each successive tapping—
trees are tapped every three or four days
—is about an inch below the previous
one. By the time the tapping has
reached the ground, the upper tapping
region has healed sufficiently to allow
the cutting to begin again in that area.
When the tree is first tapped, it yields
about two or three grams of brownish
yellow latex which contains mostly resin.
As time goes on the rubber content in-
creases until about the eighth day the
yield becomes pure white latex contain-
ing fifty percent rubber. During the
second and third week, the rubber con-
tent drops to between thirty and thirty-
five percent and remains fairly constant
thereafter.
Converting Latex to Crude Rubber
In .the virgin forests of Brazil the
smoking method of coagulation is used
almost exclusively. When the trees have
been tapped, a fire is built with such
materials as wood rich in resins, palm
nuts, and the shells of Brazil nuts. This
produces a strongly astringent smoke
containing considerable amounts of
phenol. To bring the latex into the
smoke a spade-shaped instrument is used
which consists of a wooden disc fastened
to a long handle. The paddle is dipped
in the latex and rotated in the smoke
until the rubber has coagulated in a thin
film. This procedure is repeated until
a ball of rubber of the desired size is
built up. The ball is then cut away
from the paddle and dried in the sun.
Coagulation by this method is ap-
parently brought about by the tempera-
ture change and the action of the
chemical reagents in the smoke. Because
of the absence of any scientific control,
the quality of rubber produced varies
widely. The weather and climatic con-
ditions also affect the quality of the
product produced, but in spite of the
crudeness of this method, the rubber
produced is as good as the best planta-
tion rubber attainable.
Crude rubber produced by the smok-
ing method is classified in three ways:
(1) the botanical source, (2) the degree
of care used in preparation, (3) the
region from which the rubber was ob-
tained. The most important classifica-
tion is the second. Hard, fine para
consists of balls from the smoking proc-

cised. The outer parts of the balls are
dark brown shading into amber yellow
toward the center. Medium para con-
sists of balls from the smoking process
on which no great care has been used.
The product is apt to be pasty or spongy
in parts. Coarse para is rubber that has
coagulated on the bark of the trees over
the slits or has hardened in the cups.
This scrap rubber is pressed together
without smoking. It is usually very
dirty and has little practical value.
Coagulation with Acid
Most hevea plantation rubber is coag-
ulated with acids. For many years it
was done almost exclusively with acetic
acid, but recently formic acid has come
into wide spread use. Since the proce-
dures using formic or acetic acid are
essentially the same, the latter will be
discussed here.
After the latex is brought from the
plantation, it is run through strainers to
remove impurities and lumps of rubber
formed by spontaneous coagulation in
transit. The strained suspension is col-
lected in mixing tanks where it is thor-
oughly stirred to compensate for the
heterogeneity of the solution obtained
by combining the products of different
trees. Pure, clean water is then added
to dilute the latex to definite concentra-
tion of rubber hydrocarbon. The con-
centration is carefully controlled so that
when a predetermined amount of acid is
added, the coagulation will be complete
without excess of acid remaining in the
product.
The speed of coagulation is controlled
by the degree of dilution of the latex.
A highly dilute solution will coagulate
very slowly and uniformly, thus leaving
no soft spots or hard lumps. On the
other hand, highly concentrated latex
will coagulate rapidly giving a nonuni-
form composition.
When sheet rubber is desired, the
coagulum is allowed to form in rectangu-
lar cakes. These cakes are run through
rotating even-speed washing mills and
pressed into sheets of uniform thickness.
After rolling these sheets are hung over
night in running water. This removes
the serum constituents which are
squeezed out of the rubber during con-
traction. The sheets are then allowed to
drain, and are dried and smoked for sev-
eral days.
Another method for producing sheet
rubber is that of allowing the latex to
perature. These sheets are then milled
coagulate in shallow rectangular vessels
of uniform size. The sheets thus pro-
duced are smoked during the drying
process to give them a uniform color and
to hinder the formation of mold on the
surfaces resulting from the large amount
of moisture trapped in the sheet. This
product is known industrially as smoked
sheet.
Crepe rubber is produced by running
sheets of coagulated latex through mills
rotating at different speeds. The rubber
thus processed is torn completely to
pieces. It is then rolled into thin sheets
for washing and drying at room tem-
into crepes by rolling together several
layers. The resulting rubber differs from
sheet rubber in that the surface is rough
latex tends to coagulate with the help of
no external reagents except air and sun-
light. However, a very heterogeneous
product is obtained.
Attempts to regulate the process such
as adding sugar to give uniform coagu-
lation and disinfectants to prevent for-
mation of mold have, in general, proved
unsatisfactory. At present it is used in-
dustrially only on a small scale.
Kerbosch Process
In this process, the latex is poured
into a horizontal drum equipped with
agitating blades. Along the axis of the
drum is a tube with numerous small

and the product is usually not smoked.
To produce block rubber, crepe rub-
ber which has been artificially dried in
vacuo is pressed together while still
warm. The most important reason for
the production of block rubber is the
ease and convenience with which it is
transported.
Preparation Without Coagulating
Agents
Most of the processes thus far devel-
oped which do not advocate coagulating
agents have been unsuccessful. How-
ever, they indicate a definite trend
toward a scientific approach to the prob-
lem of obtaining a pure, uncontaminated
product.
Spontaneous Coagulation
After a period of time, the rubber in
openings on the surface. The drum is
slowly rotated about its axis while the
stirring blades rotate in the opposite di-
rection. A strong blast of warm air is
blown through the perforated tube. A
thin film of latex adheres to the inside
surface of the drum and is dried by the
air blast during one revolution. After a
single revolution, a new layer is started
and continued until all the latex in the
drum is dried.
The greatest disadvantage of the Ker-
bosch process lies in the fact that all the
serum contents are retained in the rub-
ber and the water content is relatively
high. These two items add to the weight
of the product and have detrimental
effects on its chemical composition. Be-
cause of these effects and the difficulties
in controlling the process, it has never
been used on a large scale.

demolition
Not long ago the Army Engineer
Corps was presented with the oppor-
tunity of destroying a modern highway
bridge which had been abandoned a
short time before. Since most if not
all of its emolition work along these
lines had been only simulated the Engi-
neer Corps jumped at the chance.
The bridge consisted of four spans,
two of which had been removed, as well
as the flooring of the remaining spans.
There were five concrete piers, two set
on dry land and three in the water. The
level of the river varied considerably
because of the action of a power dam
located upstream, so much of the work
was done at night both to take advan-
tage of the low river level and to secure
training in preparing and placing
charges under cover of darkness.
The reasons for the Engineer Corps
blowing up this bridge were:
1. To secure experience in the execu-
tion of a large-scale demolition.
2. To test the accuracy of the for-
mulas given in the Engineer Field
Manual.
3. To get some idea of the time neces-
sary to place charges of this nature.
4. To discover the relative merits of
internal and external charges.
5. To determine the dependability of
underwater charges.
They bore in mind at all times the
two fundamentals of military demoli-
tion, namely, complete destruction and
the firing of all charges that have been
set. Furthermore, they were limited in
that the spans were not to be unneces-
sarily damaged and the center of the
river was to be kept free of debris.
It was decided to place the charges,
whether internal or external, at the base
of each pier on the side towards which
it was to fall. To further insure falling
in the proper direction pusher charges
were placed along the upper faces of
three of the piers. Three of the piers
were sprung (enlargement of a small
cavity, made with an air drill, by the
use of dynamite) to save time in the
placement of the charges.
The demolition was a complete suc-
cess. The piers were all completely de-
stroyed and fell in the desired direction
with only slight damage to the spans.
The job required a total of 301 man-
hours. Among some of the conclusions
reached were the following:
1. The formulas given in the Engi-
neer Field Manual are accurate and de-
pendable.
2. Dynamite submerged over 24 hours
is not dependable.
3. External charges, although requir-
ing much more explosives than internal
charges, are just as satisfactory and re-
quire about half the time to place.
4. Several circuits in series should be
used to detonate the charges rather than
just one circuit.

John grew up in that isolated island
metropolis. Highland Park. Unlike
many Highland Parkers, John does not
thrive on the curb lined avenues of that
bustling city but prefers traveling—par-
ticularly behind a farm plow. His intre-
pid wanderings have taken him to all
corners of the country, including Flori-
da, twice to California, and thru the
New England states. Indicative of the
attraction rural life has for John are
his hobbies and summer-time occupa-
tions, both of which take him to farm-
ing. Enjoying athletics as much as he
does, it is no wonder to find John spend-
ing much of his "leisure" (where he
finds it, I don't know) time at it.
For remuneration and relaxation from
winter scholastic activities, John has
spent his summers as camp counselor,
farmer, and traveler.
Being a member of advanced R. O.
T. C. means that he expects to enter
the ordnance department in June, when
he receives his degree in mechanical en-
gineering. After the war, John expects
to enter sales engineering or business
administration, but if you find a me-
chanical engineer running for a state
office, look again. It probably will be
John Fauver.
hutch
Born in Columbus, Ohio, in August
1921, William Ward Hutcherson re-
ceived his early education in twelve dif-
ferent schools. He was able, however,
to finish all his high school work at one
Detroit school, Cooley. In his senior
year at Cooley, Hutch besides being an
honor student was president of more
groups and organizations than any two
other men.
He still doesn't know why he came
to Michigan instead of M. I. T., but that
has never slowed up any of his work.
Bill's leadership was immediately recog-
nized by the students, who elected him
to the Engineering Council. When Black
Friday rolled aound he led a goup of
near-naked Freshmen into one of the
girls dorms. After just about tearing the
dorm apart, the briefly clad gang de-
parted without harming anyone. This
did not interfere with any of his school
work as indicated by his admittance into
Phi Eta Sigma.
During his Sophomore year he was
selected by Triangles, but it was not until

W. W. Hutcherson
In his Junior year he started work
for Professor Upthegrove in the Engi-
neering Research Lab. Bill firmly be-
lieves that this is one of the most valu-
able activities that any engineer could
possibly enter. It is his opinion that the
other departments could take a tip from
the Chem. and Met. Departments and
offer students a chance to work with a
professors in their chosen line of work.
The loves of W. W. Hutcherson have
been so unusual and extensive that there
is neither time nor space to even touch
upon them here. However, if the reader
is interested I advise the reading of
J. W. Brown's "The Love Life of W.
Ward Hutcherson" in six readable vol-
umes.
Bill's big ambition in life is to live
in the country with his wife and ten
children. He hopes to be working on the
personnel side of Metallurgical Engineer-
ing and when he goes home at night be
plans to teach the kids to work in his
private machine shop in the rear. His
wife is left with the job of making him
malted milks with lemon and lime ice
and the Dagwood Bumstead sandwiches
that he loves so well.

is not forgotten
if A MESSAGE TO MEN IN COLLEGE
There will be a future.
The very service you are being called upon
to render to your country is assurance of
that. We know the stuff you're made of,
because we have watched two generations of
college men join our ranks and grow with us.
And the materiel which we older men in
industry are pouring out makes assurance
doubly sure.
What kind of future will you have?
By chapter and verse, no one can recite
exactly. But a lot of folks like us mean to see
that Opportunity is going to be greater than
any generation of young men has ever known.
Every hour of thinking time we can catch
on the fly is devoted to that one aim. Here at
Alcoa we call it Imagineering. We are letting
our imagination soar, and ballasting it with
engineering experience. Our purpose is to
make aluminum make jobs where none ever
existed before.
The exciting new uses we glimpse for
Alcoa Aluminum are our part of the ground-
work of the structure of peace you will come
back to help to build.
Your chance is going to be the creative
chance. The materials, the tools, the tech-
niques, will be ready and waiting. Your
imagination, your ingenuity, your courage
to do, cannot, must not, fail to have their turn.
As man to man we say it, soberly: Your
future is not forgotten.

the good old days
Department of Bemoaners of The Past,
Sentimentalists Branch.
Last month our Campus black-sheep,
Garg, was bemoaning the good old days
before the Army started to make men
out of lit students.
However that may be, this year's
J-Hop (Victory Ball to the Detroit
newshawks), certainly brought a note
of yearning for the good old days, at
least to the Seniors in attendance. The
Victory Ball Committee did their best,
no doubt of that. But somehow one got
the feeling that the ghost of a bygone
year was haunting the place—the
happy-go-lucky soul of the houseparties,
the organization booths, the J-Hop
breakfasts and all the other sentimental
niceties of the past.
If we can stop crying in our beer long
enough, we're going to start gazing in
the crystal ball to see if we can find out
when we get drafted—it's as good a
method as any.
slide rule ball
Speaking of dances, The Technic is
coming forth with its annual extrava-
ganza, Slide Rule Ball, sometime in
March—Adv.

As every Freshman knows two days
after he hits this campus, the big slide
rule that presides over all these affairs is
the object of grand larceny on the part
of a few unruly lawyers. The law school
is about as extinct as vanilla ice cream
at the present time however, and we
doubt seriously if the Judge Advocate
School would be remotely interested. So
we are forced to conclude that our be-
loved memento won't even have the ex-
citement of a little tussle this year. In
fact, we aren't even bothering to set up
our photoelectric burglar alarm this
year, and the bomb-proof bank vault
with the double time lock on it, in which
our slide rule formerly resided, has long
since been contributed to the scrap
drive. George, the Union Doorman, is
sufficient for our purposes this year.
drafted
The exuberance with which engineers
do their schoolwork at the start of the
semester, and the lacksadazical fashion
in which they do it two weeks later, is a
strange phenomena, in a class with New
Year's resolutions.
A tragic example of this came to our
attention the other day. The student in
question had just completed his initial
CM 2° Laboratory experiment. It was
the first day of the semester, and, al-
though the report wasn't due for another
week, he and his two lab partners were
determined to turn over a new leaf with
a bang. So they sat up 'til the wee hours
of the morning calculating and writing
up the report. Come about three o'clock
and his two partners had long since de-
parted for the timothy, but our hero
struggled doggedly onward, religiously
determined to do things on time this
semester.

The next morning, through bleary
eyes, he glanced through his mail. He
was being drafted before the problem
was due.
The Thermodynamics
Final
To the tune of
"The Battle Hymn of the Republic"
Free energy and entropy were whirling
in his brain.
With partial differentials and Greek let-
ters in their train;
For delta, sigma, gamma, theta, epsilon
and pi
Were driving him distracted as they
danced before his eye.
Chorus
Glory, glory, dear old thermo.
Glory, glory, dear old thermo.
Glory, glory, dear old thermo.
I'll get you by and by.
Enthalpy and fugacity revolved within
his mind,
Like molecules and atoms that you
never have to wind,
With logarithmic functions doing cake-
walks in his dreams
And partial molal quantities devouring
chocolate creams.
Chorus
They asked him on the final if a mole
of any gas
In a vessel with a membrane through
which hydrogen could pass
Were compressed to half its volume,
what the entropy would be,
If two-thirds delta sigma equalled half
of delta P.
Chorus
He said he guessed the entropy would
have to equal four,
Unless the second law would bring it up
a couple more.
But then it might be seven, if the ther-
mostat was good,
Or it might be almost zero if once rightly
understood.
Chorus
The professor read his paper with a
corrugated brow,
For he knew he'd have to grade it, but
he didn't quite know how,
Till a sudden inspiration on his cerebel-
lum smote,
And he seized his trusty fountain pen
and this is what he wrote:
Chorus
"Just as you guessed the entropy, I'll
have to guess your grade,
But the second law won't raise it to the
mark you might have made;
For it might have been a hundred if
your guesses had been good,
But I think it must be zero till they're
rightly understood.

held together with threads!
r

^
At 400 m.p.h. a fighter pilot's life
literally hangs by a thread. For the
bolts and studs which help hold his
engine and plane together are only as
strong as their threads. Fortunately
those threads can be counted on
to hold. A special grinding process
makes them far safer and stronger to-
day than they would have been a few
years ago. In this process.
Carborundum-made grinding wheels
play an important role.
The method of grinding produces
threads of almost unbelievable
accuracy, free from microscopic
checks and cracks which might
cause failure under stress. This
greater accuracy justifies a
smaller safety factor, reducing
weight of dead metal. And in
most cases, production is speeded
and costs reduced.


Thread grinding is typical of the
many ways in which products and
processes developed by Carborundum
are serving America's war industry.
When you get out in the field and
encounter a production problem that
abrasives might solve, write The
Carborundum Company, Niagara Falls,

3. To enable the shop mechanic and
inspector to inspect the product surfaces
by comparing them with the proper
specimen.
The method of designation of surface
finish on a drawing is shown in Fig. 2.
The proper "f" symbol is applied to the
surface to be machined. The "fB uncut"
designation means that the specified de-
gree of smoothness is to be obtained in
the process of molding, casting, forging,
punching, etc., without machining.
In general, the method of machining
is not specified. Where this is necessary,
however, the method is added to the
numeral, for example, "f4 buff." An in-
struction sheet on the correct method of
use of these symbols is shown in Fig. 3.
It will be noted that allowances have
been made for any special cases which
may arise.
In the inspection of machined surfaces
the mechanic and inspector compare the
finished surface with the gage specimen
which most nearly approaches the ap-
pearance of the machined product. The
method of inspection in all cases con-
sists of comparison by sight and feel
with the standard surface. The surfaces
represented illustrate our standard "run
of the mill" finishes. When finishes dif-
fer widely in appearance from the sam-

Superfinished Discs
pies shown, special gages are made up.
They are numbered in the same manner
as the standard set and are built to
measure the same roughness.
The continued use of this system for
the past ten years has accelerated pro-
duction planning and tooling, and pro-
moted uniformity and interchangeability
of parts at minimum cost and delay.
This is recognized as a practical step for
present production needs and is offered
as a suggestion to those who may have
similar surface finish designation and
inspection problems to solve at this time.
The merit of the method lies in the fact
that it accurately portrays the dimen-
sional characteristics of a surface. A
sample finish specimen is actually repre-
sentative of the finished product and,
hence, most useful to design and pro-
duction personnel, and simple to in-
terpret.

•.. and we made
a Sapphire!
YOU'RE LOOKING at a sapphire being made in the
incandescent heat of a specially designed furnace...
a synthetic sapphire ... better than the natural gem.
It takes hours to grow one of these sapphire boules.
What's so wonderful about it? Sapphire is neces-
sary for the security of this country. Out of this jewel
stone are made hard, long-wearing bearings for pre-
cision instruments. The various precision devices of
a modern battleship require more than 4,000 jewels;
about 100 more are needed in fire-control mecha-
nisms. Modem pursuit planes and bombers require
up to 100 sapphire bearings in their instruments.
In 1940, this country was completely dependent
upon Europe for sapphire jewels. The call went out
for American-made sapphire to meet this nation's
needs.
Because we at Linde are experienced in the pro-
duction of gases and in the accurate control of high
temperature gas flames, we volunteered to try to
make sapphire. After two years of experimental re-
search, we learned how to produce the high-purity
raw materials needed and also how to make sapphire
from those materials.Today, we make more synthetic
sapphire than this country ever imported from Eu-
rope . . . enough to meet all industrial and military
needs. Thus America need never again be dependent
upon an outside source.
Right now, we make colorless sapphire because
colorless jewels make harder bearings. No sapphire
is available for anything but war production. In the
future we stand ready to make ruby and other gem
stone materials for the jewelry trade .. . and for you.
This research development by The Linde Air Product* Com-
pany is paralleled by other recent achievements oj Electro

poration, and National Carbon Company, Inc.—all o/ which are

which requires no enhancing buff. The
sheets are now ready for shipment to
the fabricators.
But before we take up the uses of
sheet stock, let us go back to some of
that plastic mass worked on the rolls.
Some of this can be masticated on the
rolls until very little solvent is left, then
it is slabbed into solid blocks for the
extruders, or "stuffers." Imagine a cyl-
inder with a hole in one end, a piston
in the other, and a steam jacket all
around. This is the simple concept of
an extruder. The block of nitrate is
placed inside the cylinder, heated to suf-
ficient plasticity, and when pressure is
applied, the plastic literally squirts out
of the hole, and there you have a rod
of cellulose nitrate. If the hole is re-
placed by heated dies of varied openings,
L, O, S, H, and many other shapes can
be extruded.
The extruded shapes are given a run
in the dryhouse, and come out warped
and bent. By the simple process of
soaking a warped tube in boiling water,
stretching it over a steel rod, and chill-
ing with cold water, a tube of proper
inner dimensions^ straight and true, is
obtained. Similar methods of straight-
ening are applied to the other shapes.
The physical and chemical properties
of the finished plastic can be summar-
ized as follows: Specific gravity 1.34-
1.60, tensile strength 6-9x10:l psi, elon-
gation 4-20r/(i, modulus of elasticity
(2.0-3.9)xl05 psi, Brinell Hardness
number 10-20, good dielectric properties,
yellows and decomposes on long ex-
posure to sunlight, softens in hot water,
no effect by cold water, resists weak
acids well, resists all oils and hydrocar-
bons, and dissolves in alcohols, ketones,
and esters.
The fabrication of all cellulose nitrate
is possible only because of the thermo-
plasticity or the solubility. Extrusion
has already been described and is de-
pendent on the thermoplastic property
of the cellulose nitrate. Swaging, trans-
fer molding, shearing, injection, and
blowing are all methods of fabrication
which make use of the fact that cellu-
lose nitrate softens upon being heated.
Spinning, and the making of lacquers,
takes advantage of the solubility of this
plastic in alcohols, ketones, and esters.
Most of the titles are self explanatory,
but one is especially interesting—blow-
ing. In this process, 2 sheets of the
cellulose nitrate sheet are clamped be-
tween the halves of a mold. Steam is
injected between the sheets. This steam
not only heats the material into the
range of sufficient plasticity, and thus
welds the edges of the sheets together,
but also provides the pressure to force
the bubble against the outlines of the
mold. The mold is cooled by running
water, and as the plastic gets its "set"
from the mold, cold air is shot into the
opening instead of steam, the mold
opened, and the finished article removed.

Minor finishing operations, such as
knocking off the flash, and buffing the
rough weld, are all that is necessary be-
fore the article is placed on sale.
In this brief article I have attempted
to explain the flow of sheet for the manu-
facturing process, show that the methods
of fabrications are dependent upon two
main physical characteristics, and de-
scribe the types of machines used. In
doing so for the "grandaddy of plastics"
I hope the undeserved mystery of that
awe-inspiring word "plastic" has been
partially dispelled.

PROBLEM
Charles Fisher received his engineer-
ing degree in May and immediately
reported to the Synthetic Petroleum
Corporation's research laboratories. He
was to work in the Production Labora-
tories under the supervision of William
R. Rouse but the problems were as-
signed from the Development Division
which was designing new synthetic
plants.
Within a few weeks, Charlie found
that on several occasions his solution to
the Development Division's would have
been of more use if he would have
understood their problems more thor-
oughly. Inquiries to Bill Rouse concern-
ing the background of a new problem of
analyzing gases given off from a liquid
at 600 pounds and a series of tempera-
tures invoked the statement that Charlie
would be better off to do as he was told
rather than to spend his time worrying
about the uses that the Development
Division would make of his data.
That evening, at a friend's house,
Charlie met Grant Terry, a young en-
gineer in the Development Division, who
explained the nature of the design for
which Charlie's data would be useful.
The discussion brought out that it would
be more beneficial to have the analyses
over a series of pressures at one or two
temperatures rather than all at one
pressure.
The next morning, Charlie mentioned
meeting Grant and suggested to Bill that
they visit the supervisor of the Develop-
ment Division to discuss the possibility
of analyzing the gases at a series of
pressures. However, Bill said he was too
busy to discuss the situation and refused
to have Charlie go to them alone.
That noon, Charlie met Grant on the
way to lunch and Grant introduced his
supervisor. The supervisor greeted
Charlie and remarked that Grant had
mentioned to him the suggested change
in the experiments. He then asked
Charlie to come to his office that after-
noon at three. Charlie quickly assured
him that he would be there, but immedi-
ately he began to wonder how it could
be arranged with Bill Rouse. What
action should he take?

navy gun mounts
Record-breaking production of the
new American 1.1 in. multiple gun
mounts carrying four rapid-fire anti-
aircraft guns—the weapons which hurled
hundreds of shells a minute at Japanese
planes in the great battles of the Pacific
—made possible by large scale manufac-
ture—has placed these new gun units on
active duty on every type of American
warship.
Before our entry into the war, each
gun mount required about 800 man-
hours of labor and cost about $27,000,
but assembly line production methods
have cut the time to 2100 man-hours of
work at a cost $12,000. By May, 1942,
production had been increased by 40%.
Weighing 14,000 pounds, each mount
consists of an adjustable gun support
installed in an H-shaped stand which
is moored to a revolving steel base.
Each gun support has four large grooves
into which water-cooled gun barrels are
inserted. The four guns, although not
synchronized, are fired in nearly simul-
taneous bursts by a single trigger
mechanism on the left side of the unit.
Guided by sights on both sides of the
unit, the guns are trained on the target

Dielectric Plastics
The sights on this gun mount are
tested before installation on combat
vessels and a maximum tolerance of one
minute is allowed. This tolerance, 1/60
of a degree, would result in a deviation
by the shells fired of not more than ten
and one-half inches per thousand yards.
plastic insulation
Organic-plastic substances are playing
increasingly prominent roles as solid
dielectric materials. Their new impor-
tance is marked by recent developments
of new types as well as by improved
processing and manufacturing tech-
niques.
Organic plastics are made available as
electrical insulating materials in molded,
laminated, extruded and cast forms,
films or foils, and impregnating var-
nishes. The electrical properties of these
various forms, such as the dietlectric
strength, insulation resistance, arc re-
sistance, dielectric constant and the
power factor, determine the different
purposes for which each is utilized.
These dielectric qualities are dependent
upon the conditions of manufacture as
well as the conditions of ser%'ice.
Plastic materials are often modified
with plasticizers to improve physical
properties, although dielectric properties
sometimes suffer. In most cases a com-
promise must be reached between elec-
trical and mechanical properties.

"METALLIC VITAMINS" FOR INDUSTRY
So effective are relatively minute quantities of ce-
mented carbides in stepping up—pepping up—pro-
duction that they are often called the "metallic
vitamins" of industry.
Because only small quantities are required per tool,
Carboloy cemented carbides are measured in grams.
A gram is 1/453rd part of a pound. A Carboloy tool tip
weighing only 25 grams or slightly less than one ounce
is a good size tip—enough to last for days, weeks—often
months of cutting at speeds often higher than 4 to 5
times that possible with ordinary steel tools.
In terms of production, an ounce of cemented carbide
can turn the turrets of dozens of tanks, or drill hun-
dreds of guns, or turn as many as several hundred
shell, or bore the cylinders of hundreds of "Jeep" cars.
One ounce of carbide can do these and countless other
crucial machining jobs faster and better than any
other tool material.
These "metallic vitamins" also serve the cause of
victory in many other ways. In masonry drills, they
drill holes in concrete 75% faster for installing war
production machinery. ... In dies they speed up
production of wire, cartridge cases, bullets, etc. . . .
As wear-resistant Inserts on vital machine parts, they
keep machines running. As a matrix material, they
conserve diamonds, shorten operating time on mine
drilling, dressing of grinding wheels, etc.
The myriad of present uses for Carboloy—the
"metallic vitamin" of industry—now helping to speed
the day of victory, forecast the steadily increasing
diversity of benefits for the years of peace to come.

prolific engineer
Professor Hugh Edward Keeler is
further proof of the saying, most great
men are born in February. Back home
to him is Cassopolis, Michigan, where
he was born on February 14, 18—. He
obtained his degrees of B.E.E., B.M.E.,
M.S.E., and M.E. all from the Univer-
sity of Michigan and is now a consult-
ing and professional engineer in both
the mechanical and electrical fields.
At Michigan he is a member of Tau
Beta Pi, a charter member of Iota Al-
pha, and an honorary member of Vul-
cans. His memberships in professional
societies—twelve in all—reads like a list
of governmental agencies. Heading the
list are A.S.M.E., A.I.E.E., A.S.R.E.,
and S.A.E.

Hugh E. Keeler
Professor Keeler has published an
impressive list of papers many of which
have appeared in earlier issues of the
TECHNIC. Most of these papers have
been on refrigeration, evidently his fav-
orite field of concentration. His list of
research projects carried on through the
Engineering Research Department is
equally impressive.
That he is a jack-of-all-trades, mas-
ler-oi-many, is evident from a glance
at the widely varying positions he has
held. Even before graduation from high
school Professor Keeler worked as a
plumber, electrician, and automobile
mechanic. During his college career he
worked as garage mechanic, installer of
battery charging plants, sheet-metal
stamper, and time-study engineer. In
his graduate days at Michigan, he de-
signed heating and ventilating systems
and tested pumping engines. A teaching
assistantship occupied his spare time.
His industrial affiliations as a consulting
engineer after leaving school are far too
numerous to mention here.
Professor Keeler's spare time is taken
up largely by his favorite sport and
hobby—rifle and pistol shooting. He
neglected to mention how good a shot
he is, but if you were to judge his ex-
cellence in shooting by his excellence in
academic and technical matters, you can
be sure he is a crack-shot.
engineer extraordinaire
You have probably seen him on the
other side of the campus as often as in
the engine school, for Louis Bill Sessions
is active in many all-campus organiza-
tions and has a B.A. and Phi Beta key
to back him up.
It all started on the North Side of
Muskegon,Michigan, where Bill ("don't
call me Louis'') followed the usual pat-
tern of being born, growing up, and at-
tending the North Side high school. But
there the usual pattern stopped. While
at high school, Bill developed a habit
of winning honors that has followed him
thru his college career. During his high
school days he played four years of
varsity football and tennis, a year of
basketball, three years of debating to
balance the athletics and graduated vale-
dictorian at sixteen to sort of balance
everything.
He decided he was too young to enter
college immediately, so Bill took a year
of post-graduate work in his favorite
field, chemistry, and was an assistant in
that subject. One day while giving a
demonstration to a group of girls on how
to make a chemical volcano, Bill added
more than the usual cautious amount
of reagent in his enthusiasm for the
subject and in his zealousness to pro-
duce a successful experiment for the
girls' benefit. As the mixture (concen-
trated H,SO4, alcohol, KMnO,, and a
little red pepper for flavoring) began to
pop, Bill rushed over to the hood and
managed to close the window just as the
volcano erupted unceremoniously and
made powdered glass of what was once
an Ehrlenmeyer flask.
After a year of this work, Bill set out
to conquer new fields and found the
University of Michigan the most in-
viting opponent. The hardest decision,
however, was between law and chemis-
try. His father, a lawyer, and his grand-
father, a federal judge, for some unac-
countable reason seemed to think more
of law than of chemistry, but Bill im-
partially decided to give both a try and
enrolled as a student in the literary
college. It was in the second semester
when working in a qual lab and watch-
ing the girls go by with their tennis
racquets and the fellows with their golf
bags (I said golf) that Bill decided
there might be something to this law
stuff. He thereupon breezed thru lit
school with an all A average until
senioritis hit him in his last year and
he received two B's.

Bill Sessions
While in lit school Bill found time
to play tennis, winning his numerals
and reserve letter, but failing to make
his varsity letter because of a serious
eye injury suffered in his senior year
that blinded one eye for over a month.
At the end of his lit career Bill enrolled
in Yale, paid his fees, and was all ready
to go when he had a change of heart,
threw law overboard, and went back to
chemistry.
But this time he decided to obtain
an engineering background to base his
chemistry on and forthright combined
them in his chosen field of chemical
engineering. Carrying 20 hours of engine
work every semester didn't keep Bill
busy enough, so now he is president of
Tau Beta pi and the Men's Judiciary
Council and is member of the War
Board and the Student Affairs Com-
mittee.
After graduation, like many other
engineers, Bill will enter the armed serv-
ice for the duration. But it won't be
forever, and at the end Bill will go into
engineering for his life work—probably
in research.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


When early spring is in the air
And coeds shed their coats,
When cloudless skies are blue and fair
And freshmen feel their oats,
It's pretty hard to go to school
And listen to a dull tool's drool.
In fact, the time of year is such
That no one thinks of very much.
BUT
GIVE THIS A THOUGHT . .
1. The 'Ensian price will soon go up
to $5.00 (only $4.50 now.)
2. Balance payment on the 'Ensian are
due March 22. Any orders not paid up by
then will be canceled.

WHERE DO WE STAND?
r"PHE student engineer's status in
■*• America's rapidly expanding war
program has never been accurately
enough denned to enable us to intelli-
gently plan our upper-class and post-
graduation activities. Conflicting
statements by the press and by Wash-
ington's innumerable boards and bu-
reaus have given us only a hazy con-
ception of our position in the war
effort.
While the War Manpower Com-
mission has said that upper-classmen
in approved engineering colleges may
be deferred under the Selective Serv-
ice Act, it has not stated whether or
not these men will be permitted to
graduate. Educators encourage stu-
dents to remain in school as long as
possible, but even they give no satis-
factory answer as to the position of
the individual.
Further, if we are allowed to grad-
uate, will we be placed in the armed
forces or in industrial war produc-
tion? If we are to fight, let them
take us now; you need no college
education to kill Japs. Too, a year or
two of school after the war can act
as a buffer to reorientate the student
engineer in the field he has chosen.
Many students, expecting to be
drafted, relaxed their efforts this past
semester with, in many cases, fatal
results. They thought what the hell,
if I'm going to be taken out of school,
I may as well have a good time be-
fore I go. They used Private Har-
grove's psychology: have a good time
and raise cain beforehand, after
you're in it'll be a different story.
However, at the end of the semester
many of these men were told to stay
in school—that they had been de-
ferred. Couldn't the status of these
men have been clarified earlier? It
would have eliminated their scholas-
tic declines.
Presumably the WMC wants tech-
nically trained men to remain in in-
dustry, but local boards not realizing
the urgent need for these men have
inducted them in many cases prior to
induction of other less essential work-
ers. Consequently, vital war indus-
tries are feeling the pinch of insuffi-
cient and inefficient technical staffs.
The distribution of manpower be-
tween industry and the armed forces
is one of the major headaches con-
fronting Washington big-wigs at this
time; but if a successful termination
of the war is to be realized in the
shortest possible time, is it not rea-
sonable to expect an intelligent classi-
fication of all trained and untrained,
skilled and unskilled men?
Students—engineering and liberal
arts alike—have been called slackers
for not answering the call to colors,
but this accusation is unfounded and
without justification. We are consci-
entiously determined to see this war
through to an eternal peace, and to
this end we will give unstintingly of
ourselves, our time, and our talents,
whether it be at the battlejront or on
the homefront.

necessary to insure that the materials meet the exact-

The operation of the equipment is simple and under-

electrodes of a high voltage circuit. Current passed
through this circuit causes these electrodes to spark
brightly. The total color of this spark is separated by a
grating device into the wave lengths of the colors pres-

... What is so good about the Japanese
Zero fighter? First a few facts about
the Zero. It is a single seater with a
1000 horsepower engine and good ma-
neuverability. It can climb very well
and has a high ceiling.
When compared with our fighters it
is inferior in many respects. Its speed is
not as high as that of the American
fighter plane, but its climb is equal to
that of our fighter planes. American
planes, while heavier and carrying more
horsepower, have many features such
as high fire power, armor protection for
pilot, self sealing gas tanks and rugged-
ness which the Japanese planes do not
have. Because of these advantages, the
American plane is still able to knock out
a good many Jap planes for every
American shot down.
... Indiana and Arizona are making it
difficult for speeders to obtain new tires.
The Arizona Police photograph the
speeder, obtaining a picture of the of-
fender, the license number, and actual
speed. This information is turned over
to the speeder's local tire rationing
board. In Indiana, anyone who drives
at an excessive speed is given a special
warning ticket. A copy is also sent to
their local rationing board.
... Nylon wanted as scrap!!! Each day
a new material is added to the growing
list of articles on the salvage list. A large
chemical company has developed a
method by which they may convert ny-
lon waste back to some of the complex
chemicals that were originally used in
making the nylon stockings and other
apparel.
... Submarine warfare is tough on men
and equipment. All submarine search-
lights must pass a rugged test before
they can be accepted by the navy. In
service they must be able to withstand
the shock of a gun fired a few feet away,
the force imposed by diving at full speed,
and also the impact of heavy waves. To
be sure the searchlight will stand up
under such conditions, the U. S. Navy
requires that the light be subjected to
a 2000 pound shock test. This is the
same as dropping a 200 pound weight

The winning of the war is the first objective—
everyone agrees to that. That is why the Zinc industry
is concentrating its efforts on production; for Zinc is
so very important, in so many ways, that it has been
placed in the list of essential, strategic materials. In
other words, the use of Zinc is a "must"—for many
purposes nothing else can take its place.
This new book, "Zinc in Wartime", is a pictorial
story of the ways in which Zinc is helping to win the
war. Hundreds of photographs show the great variety
of uses to which Zinc is put, in planes, tanks, battle-
ships, in all kinds of fighting equipment. The book is
more than interesting; it is fascinating, inspiring. It is
worth reading. You can get a copy by writing to the

for taking so long to produce these units
is a lack of fusion equipment for melted
finish plate. Later IS more units will
be operating and before the year is over,
28 units will be capable of producing 40
to 45 million base boxes of electrolytic
tin plate. During the first quarter, it is
expected that only 1,800,000 base boxes

the only damage suffered was several
buckled deck plates. Fifty minutes
later a second torpedo hit the ship.

HEATING
By
KENNETH R. MOEHL, '43E
INDUCTIVE losses, which have long
A been obstacles in the electrical in-
dustry, have now been put to use.
From the time of the earliest experi-
ments with electricity it was known that
metals could be heated inductively, and
for the past twenty years low-frequency
induction heating has been in use in
specialized melting applications. With-
in the last ten years this method has
been applied to surface hardening. Now
high-frequency motor-generator sets and
vacuum tube oscillators have expanded
the uses of induction heating until thou-
sands of processes are handled by it.
Induction heating can be roughly seg-
regated into three classes according to
the frequency of the power used. For
forging, surface hardening, and brazing
rous metals either directly or by heating
an electrically conductive crucible, fre-
quencies up to 1000 cycles per second
are used. Power is generated by motor-
generator sets and ranges up into thou-
sands of kilowatts.
The second group covers frequencies
from 1000 to 12,000 cycles with power
generated almost entirely by rotating
machinery. Power requirements are
large and vary from 20 to 1200 kw.
Practically all heating processes are cov-
ered by this group—soldering, melting,
forging, surface hardening, and brazing
are all included. The lower frequencies
are used for melting non-ferrous alloys
and for surface hardening large parts,
while the higher frequencies find appli-
cation on small parts.
In the frequency range from 50,000
to 1.000,000 cycles and higher, genera-
tion is almost entirely restricted to
spark-gap and vacuum-tube oscillators.
Spark-gap equipment can be built for
frequencies up to 200 kilocycles with
power outputs up to 25 kw. Vacuum
tube oscillators, although having no
limit to their frequency or power, are
economically better suited to frequen-
cies over 150 kc, and power outputs of
200 kw are easily attained. When ir-
regular parts are to be surface hardened
and the contour must be closely fol-
lowed, where coupling is difficult be-
cause of the shape or small size of the
part, and where extreme localization of
heat is necessary the higher frequencies
are used. It is difficult to heat the non-
ferrous low-resistance metals such as
copper, aluminum, and brass at the in-
termediate frequencies, but the higher
frequencies permit successful heating.
Frequencies up to 30,000 kilocycles
have been used.
The advantages of induction heating
are many. Perhaps the three most im-
portant ones are that heat can be in-
duced into the metal just where it is
wanted, at the desired intensity, and
under the most exacting control. Prac-
tically all induction heating installations
can be rendered fully automatic, making
this method especially suited for mass
production processes. Heating or cool-
ing of the charge can be at any desired
rate and in any controlled atmosphere,
even a vacuum. Irregular parts can be
hardened by induction heating when
they cannot be feasibly treated in any
other way. The equipment requires
little floor space and can be located at
any point in the production line. The
furnace proper is but a small part of
the investment and about 90 per cent
of the equipment can be used intact
for other work should it be desired.
Working conditions in the vicinity of
the furnace are better than if a gas or
oil-fired furnace were used and all the
heat is concentrated in the material to
be heated.
The old theory that metal must be
held at supercritical temperature for a
long period is going into discard with
the discovery that only a few seconds in
solution are necessary. This fact alone
is one of the major advantages of high-
frequency induction heating, for the
charge can be brought up to heat in
a fraction of a second. Heating for
surface hardening is particularly fast,
and because of the speed only a light,
soft scale is formed.
A by-product advantage of this proc-
ess is that it facilitates inspection. If
the part being heated is cracked or por-
ous, abnormally high current will flow
at that point and manifests itself by
melting the surface adjoining the defect.
The basic theory of induction heating
is fairly simple. Any charge to be heat-
ed can be thought of as a short-circuited
secondary of a transformer, the primary
winding being the heater coil to which
the power is supplied. Because of the
short-circuited condition, large currents
are induced in the charge and heating
results from the resistive and hysteresis
losses. At low frequencies uniform heat-
ing throughout the volume of the charge
is obtained by this method. However,
as the frequency of the supply power
is increased current is concentrated in
the surface of the parts, and the inner
volume receives heat largely by conduc-
tion. With the frequency high enough
and the power supplied great enough, a
thin surface layer can be brought to a
molten state and quenched before the
core has a chance to heat.
Another phenomenon evident at high
frequencies is proximity effect. If two
parallel conductors are carrying current
in opposite directions, the current will
tend to concentrate in the adjacent por-
tions. By making the charge part of
the heating coil circuit and placing the
conductor comprising the rest of the
circuit next to the charge surface, only
a selected portion of a flat surface may

CARGO CARRIERS
By
JOHN R. SIEKERT, '43E
BECAUSE of its widespread use on
land as a structural material, re-
inforced concrete presents itself in these
days of shortages as a natural substitute
for steel in the construction of cargo
ships. But, though there are many ad-
vantages in producing concrete ships in
critical times, it is unwise to expect re-
inforced concrete to entirely replace
steel in ship construction. Therefore,
it is not the purpose of this article to
propose concrete ships as a substitute
for steel ships; but rather to outline
vessel, a 400 ton motorship, and through
the enthusiastic efforts of her builder,
that this country began to experiment
with the new ship building material.
It was not until late in the war, how-
ever, that the Emergency Fleet Cor-
poration began its work of building con-
crete ships and at the close of the war
the work was abandoned.
The greatest difficulty the pioneers of
concrete ship construction had to over-
come was convincing their governmental
bureaus that reinforced concrete was
;he wind and sea drove her four miles
inshore. The ship bumped violently
with every heave of the sea and was
left high and dry on the sand when the
tide subsided. For nearly a month of
stormy winter weather the ship remained
on her perch, bumping and racking with
every tide. Then on the 6th of Feb-
ruary she was put back out to sea by
the pull of her own engines and deck
machinery tugging at anchors. Imme-
diately she went to London and there
was thoroughly inspected. She was

what has been done to supplement steel
shipbuilding with an entirely different
type of ship construction, and to show
with what success the pioneers in this
field have met.
During World War I concrete ships
were built in England, France, Spain,
Italy, Germany, Norway, Turkey,
China, and the United States. While
most of these countries built only small
ships, lighters and barges; the United
States experimented with one of 7500
tons dead weight. Norway was the
first country to launch a self propelled,
sea-going concrete ship; and it was only
after the successful trial trips of this

adaptable to ship construction, and that
it was strong enough and tough enough
to withstand heavy seas and hard shoals.
The following example of satisfactory
service will serve to point out that re-
inforced concrete M a suitable material
for the construction of ships.
The M. S. Askelad, a Norwegian-
built concrete freighter of 1920 tons,
ran aground on a sand bank in the
Somme River estuary on the 16th of
January, 1919. She had been following
the coast of France to avoid the prevail-
ing heavy seas and strong winds. In
an attempt to get the ship back out to
sea, the helm was put hard over but

found to be quite sound although there
were many slight cracks in the frames
and girders and a slight leak was dis-
covered in the bottom shell. The total
damage to the hull was repaired by the
crew, and the ship was perfectly tight
and structurally sound. The grounding
of Askelad gave convincing proof that
reinforced concrete is a durable enough
material for building ships.
Much skepticism was encountered
over the possibility of a ship made of
a material as dense as concrete to carry
a sufficient amount of cargo to make
such a venture worthwhile. Let it be
understood here that concrete ships are

not compete with steel ships during or-
dinary times, they were a practical solu-
tion of the need for ships under condi-
tions of war.
The relative carrying capacity of
concrete vessels had been somewhat
increased by the development in this
country of a bloated clay, to be used
instead of ordinary aggregate. This
clay produced a concrete of lighter
weight which was slightly stronger than
ordinary concrete. By using this "light-
weight" concrete it was possible to build
a freighter of greater carrying efficiency
than wooden ships and only slightly
less than steel ships. Since the last
war, ordinary structural concrete has
been greatly improved so that now even
greater efficiency could be attained.
Another factor leading to a great
deal of skepticism was that the saving
in steel would not be significant enough
to warrant the change-over. However,
like any other reinforced concrete struc-
ture the ship is designed with just
enough steel to take the tension; the
concrete takes compression. No excess
steel had to be provided to allow for
corrosion since steel imbedded in con-
crete is sufficiently protected. The
actual saving in steel has proved to be
35% and over.
Essentially two methods have been
used in building concrete ships; name-
ly, the sectional or slab method, and
the monolithic method. The former,
as the name implies, involves the pre-

Professor Townsend is probably the
only person in the Chemical Engineer-
ing Department who is able to read a
slide rule to five significant figures. He
does admit, however, that the accuracy
of the last digit is probably question-
able; and four figures is the best he can
do on the right end of the rule.
A native of Saginaw, Professor Town-
send began his college career at Pratt
Institute in Brooklyn. One day while
waiting table at old P.I., he met the
girl who later became Mrs. Townsend.

Richard E. Townsend
After leaving Pratt with a certificate
in applied chemistry under his belt, he
spent a year teaching in the chemical
warfare division of the United States
Army, supplementing his work with
research on diphenylchlorarsine. After
this he was employed by Dow as oper-
ating engineer in the bromine plant.
He first came to Michigan in Febru-
ary, 1921, as a student of chemical en-
gineering. He received his B.S.E. in
1924, and immediately began work on
his Master's Degree, after receiving a
Gas Association fellowship.
He left Michigan in 1925 and accept-
ed a position with The Consumers'
Power Company as an engineering su-
pervisor. He worked for this company
for ten years, and then returned to
Michigan to obtain a degree of Chem-
ical Engineer.
Among the many organizations of
which he is a member are A.I.Ch.E.,
A.C.S., Sigma Xi, and Phi Lambda Up-
silon. He is also one of the founders of
Iota Alpha.
Professor Townsend is an enthusias-
tic boat designer and sailor, spending
most of his spare time in the summer
"cruising" on Barton Pond. He loves
to putter—in fact, he spends a good
deal of time nursing a victory garden
of which he is very proud.
Iucky'13'
There are probably those who would
say that being the 13th grandchild as
well as being born on Friday the 13 th
would be a definite disadvantage, but
it doesn't seem to have given Herbert
S. Heavenrich much trouble.
Born in northern Wisconsin, the land
of fish and game, Herb developed a
taste for outdoor life early in his youth.
This taste was so well developed that
he has spent most of his summers out
in the fresh air either acting as a coun-
selor at a summer camp, or going on
canoeing and fishing trips, two of his
favorite pastimes. He'll never forget
one canoeing trip in Canada because
the canoe tipped over and the party
lost one-third of their food supply as
well as a lot of camping equipment. It
wasn't too much fun sleeping six people
in a three-man tent and eating fried
bread. To round out his experience
Herb has also worked as an apple
picker, upholstery cleaner, and estima-
tor for a contractor not to mention his
short-lived job as brush salesman.
In his freshman year he continued his
high school activities by going out for
track and the Ensian. He later ob-
tained a position on the Union staff and
last summer became co-chairman of the
Post-War Council for which he was the
Union representative. Recently he oc-
cupied his time by working as co-chair-
man of publicity for the Slide Rule Ball.
From his key chain dangle keys from
Phi Eta Sigma, Triangles, and Tau Beta
Pi. He is also a member of the Greek
world as a frater in Zeta Beta Tau.

Herbert S. Heavenrich
Herb is not in any reserve program
and, consequently, hasn't given much
thought toward an advanced degree
since the most he can hope for under
present conditions is to obtain his B.S.
in Civil Engineering. However, he ad-
mitted that he had become interested
in prefabricated housing and might
some day obtain a master's degree
through research in this field.
financier
November 14, 1921, was a happy
day in the home of the Alexanders,
when Charles Freeman (known to his
friends as C. F. or Alex) was born.
Alex started on the pathways of sci-
ence when he was still attending high
school. In the halls of Pembrook Coun-
try Day School hangs a plaque with
the name of C. Freeman Alexander en-
graved on it. He was given this honor
for showing the most interest in science
of anyone in the student body. One of
his early experiments was the building
of a lie detector, but he was never able
to make it work. However he was
successful in building a working model
of the Frasch process for mining sulfur.
12
THE MICHICAN TECHNIC


Alex began to think of college. Like
many budding engineers of our time, he
wanted to go to M.I.T. However M.I.T.
did not offer the social advantages that
Michigan did, so three days before
Michigan opened, Freeman presented
himself before the registrar and wanted
to know if he could enroll here. After
some arguing, he finally persuaded the
registrar to let him enroll here at Michi-
gan.

C. Freeman Alexander
Alex was a Technic man from the
start. One day during his sophomore
year, he walked into the Technic office
and said that he would like a job. He
did his work so well that, two months
later, Freeman was given the position
of circulation manager. Although he
had a few setbacks in his first year
(socialitis), Alex's talents were appre-
ciated in his Junior year when he was
invited to join Triangles and Vulcans.
Among his other activities for that year
were publicity manager for Slide Rule
Ball and the Union Opera, and also busi-
ness manager of the Arch and the Tech-
nic. This year Alex was elected
treasurer of the senior class, and was
financial chairman of Slide Rule Ball.
It seems that an old disease, com-
monly known as socialitis, has renewed
its attacks on Alex, and most any night
he may be seen wandering away from
the Beta house and heading toward
Tappan Street.
Although Freeman Alexander could
have graduated with a B.S.E. in Me-
chanical Engineering this February, he
stayed this semester to get a degree in
Marine Engineering to help him after
graduation into the Navy. When the
war is over, he plans to enter business
engineering.
merman
Johnny "Weismuller" Patten, of Car-
bondale, Pennsylvania, is another out-
standing senior engineer. His hobby,
model airplanes, influenced his choice
of aeronautical engineering.
He attended high school at Carbon-
dale for three years and then transferred
to Wyoming Seminary. This prep school,
however, is not in Wyoming, but in
Kingston, Pennsylvania. While he was
there, he was Cum Laude, and was also
awarded the Rensselaer Polytechnic In-
stitute Medal for excellence in science
and mathematics.
Technic Alumnus

John R. Patten
His swimming career started at the
age of four, when he began to paddle
about at his family's cottage. His swim-
ming talents were already being put to
good use when he was attending prep
school. Captain of Michigan's swim-
ming team, he is the Big Ten and Na-
tional Intercollegiate Champion in the
one hundred free style, and the runner-
up in the two hundred twenty free
style. He also swam in the winning
four hundred yard relay team for the
National Intercollegiate Championship.
A member of Delta Upsilon, he held
the position of secretary when he was
a junior, and of chief grafter (house
manager) when a senior. To his Michi-
gamua brother braves, he is known as
"puddle-paddler." His other campus
activities include Vulcans, Triangles,
and Scabbard and Blade.
Plans are now being made for him
by the Air Corps, although he has heard
nothing definite yet. After the war, he
intends to return to school and earn his
Master's Degree in Aeronautical Engi-
neering. Until then, however, he will de-
vote his time and talents to axing the
axis.

Robert L. Taylor
If you look back in our files to the
school year 1935-36 you will find a
particularly good series of issues which
were published under the able editor-
ship of Robert L. Taylor, 36E.
This may or may not be significant,
but recently Mr. Taylor was made edi-
tor of Chemical Industries, the business
magazine of industrial chemistry.
When he was piloting the Technic to
one of its many first places in national
competition, he did not plan to make
industrial journalism his life work, but
his interests seem to have concentrated
along these lines ever since graduation.
He is national chairman of Engineering
College Magazines Associated, an or-
ganization composed of the undergradu-
ate journals of technical institutes and
engineering schools, and prior to ac-
ceptance of his new position was asso-
ciate editor of Chemical and Metallur-
gical Engineering. He is the author of
many technical articles and assisted in
an advisory capacity on the editorial
boards of Monsanta Magazine and
Monsanto News.
As an undergraduate at Michigan,
Mr. Taylor was a member of Vulcans
and Triangles and served on the Engi-
neering Council. During his under-
graduate days he published an article
in Chemical and Metallurgical Engi-
neering which received so much acclaim
that the editor of that magazine inter-
viewed him and offered him a position
on the editorial board of McGraw-Hill
Company.
Mr. Taylor's rise has not been acci-
dental, nor has it been sudden. His
colleagues on the Technic were quick
to recognize a go-getter when they
wrote, back in 1936: "Bob possesses
those characteristics which spell suc-
cess, and we feel certain that when he
displays the initiative and logic in his
new work that he has at Michigan, he
will conquer proportionally greater
fields."

shot testing
Inspection of shot in the nation's war
plants has long been a head-ache to
ordnance inspectors. Visual examination
is not sufficient because only surface de-
fects can be detected. Consequently,
pieces containing defects due to internal
stresses and strains pass the inspector's
scrutiny and find their way to the bat-
tlefield where they are accepted as per-
fectly good ammunition. Naturally,
defective shot is of little value because
in order to be armor-piercing it must
be perfect.
Air conditioning and refrigeration
have come to the rescue in this depart-
ment by providing a method of shock-
testing each piece rapidly and efficiently
before manual inspection.
The new process is continuous and
can be tied in with rapid moving pro-
duction lines. The shot is received on
a conveyor and carried through a series
of insulated water tanks. From room
temperature the pieces are raised to
40°F in the first bath, 212° in the sec-
ond, and brought back to 40° in the
third. To prevent corrosion it is finally
passed through a bath of oil. If any of
the shot tested is defective, the strains
show up as surface cracks upon removal
from the last bath.
spray analysis
A new photographic device using a
5500 volt spark for taking split-second
pictures of liquid sprays may be a pos-
sible aid for obtaining more miles per
gallon of gasoline from automobiles and
airplanes.
The spray analyzer has been used to
photograph drops as small as 200 mil-
lionths of an inch in diameter, or one
thirtieth as big as the head of a pin.
Since the fineness of the gasoline spray
influences the vaporization rate, the ef-
ficiency of any carburetor may be pre-
determined by use of the analyzer.
Water drops studied are so tiny that
they would evade the camera if ordinary
exposures were used, so the pictures are
taken in 10 millionths of a second by
means of a high intensity flash from
the 5500 volt spark. The camera points
directly at the flash and the spray passes
between them. A condenser lens in front
of the spark concentrates the light on
the lens and the tiny spray particles are
then represented on the film as white
dots. The film is enlarged 65 times on
a ruled chart where the droplets are
easily analyzed.
fatigue of luminescents
Recent tests conducted reveal that
luminescent molecules when exposed to
ultraviolet light become fatigued. The
molecules lose their efficiency and tend
to slow down their production of lumi-
nescence. After a suitable rest in the
dark the molecules regain their full
strength.
In view of the tremendous and con-
tinuing growth of fluorescent lighting.
factual information regarding this phe-
nomena has become increasingly neces-
sary. Using newly devised apparatus
and operating under different intensi-
ties of short wave irradiation, valuable
data was secured from organic and in-
organic materials.
Due to the varying conditions of
material and manner of testing it be-
came necessary to resort to several
schemes to obtain the data needed. In
one test the substance to be tested was
placed inside a low-pressure mercury-
vapor lamp. The visible and ultra-
violet light output as well as the time
were measured by means of a high-
speed oscillograph. To achieve the
same effect, in another experiment
powdered material was painted on the
quartz envelope of a mercury-vapor
lamp. A thorium photocell was used
to pick up the ultraviolet radiation
while a caesium photocell registered the
visible light.

Of the great variety of materials
tested, only zinc sulphide and zinc-
cadmium sulfide failed to show evi-
dences of molecular fatigue. Both are,
however, too unstable for commercial
lamp use. Calcium tungstate, magne-
sium tungstate, cadmium borate, and
zinc silicate were among the materials
tested. Of this group zinc silicate
showed the greatest loss of efficiency.
Exhaustive examinations developed
conclusively a molecular fatigue effect in
substances identified with the produc-
tion of fluorescent light. It is felt, how-
ever, that further study might reveal
methods of overcoming this fatigue ef-
fect in fluorescent materials.
zinc at war
Zinc—in all of its metallic and pig-
ment forms—has gone to war. Today's
greatly increased production of this soft
forgotten, but very necessary metal, is
being sped to war plants throughout
our nation. The increased production
schedules tending to help make the
United States the "Arsenal of Democ-
racy" has put a heavy load on the
manufacturers of all essential materials
and the zinc producers are meeting the
demand.
Metallic zinc is obtained by smelting
zinc ores and condensing the vapor to
molten zinc which is subsequently cast
into slabs. The old proces for accom-
plishing this was carried out in horizon-
tal retort furnaces, which utilize hori-
zontal rows of clay retorts and con-
densers. A mixture of coal and ore is
charged into each retort, where carbon

Fatigue Measurement
in the coal unites with the oxygen of
the zinc ore, and metallic zinc is liber-
ated. The distilled zinc collects in the
condensers from which it is drawn into
ladles for casting.
As in practically every other indus-
try, the pressure of war production has
brought out many new processes and im-
provements on old ones. This is true of
the process for smelting zinc ore de-
scribed above. The new development
for processing zinc ore has the advan-
tage of continuous large scale operation.
In this process, vertical retorts are used.
The charge is in the form of briquettes
which are fed into the top of the re-
tort, the residue being continuously dis-
charged from the bottom. The zinc is
then distilled from the retort and passes
into a condenser from which the con-
densed metal is tapped.
The zinc is made into sheets, bars,
and other forms to be sent to other
manufacturers for processing into innu-
merable articles ranging from plates
which are bolted to the exteriors of
ships hulls to provide sacrificial corro-
sion and save the steel, to alloy forms
for shell and cartridge cases, fuse parts,
and stamping dies.

the depth of penetration is small be-
cause of the high permeability, but in-
creases rather abruptly at the tempera-
ture above which the material becomes
nonmagnetic. When this happens the
power being absorbed in the surface
layer is reduced and penetration in-
creases.
The space required by the inductor
or heating coil is small compared to
that occupied by the charge handling
equipment, and the coil can be mounted
at any point in the production line.
The shape of the inductor is dictated
by the shape of the part to be heated.
If the charge is large or irregular, the
coil can be hinged and parted circum-
ferentially to allow it to be placed in
position around the charge. This pro-
cedure is used on mass production set-
ups. If necessary a flexible, insulated
conductor can be wrapped about the
charge. Coils can be of square or ir-
regular section, flat or dish shaped to
fit the contour of the charge. To ob-
tain non-uniform heating, coils are
wound with turns concentrated about
some parts of the charge and loosely
spaced at others. For internal-surface
heating the inductor can be small
enough to fit inside the bore.
Frequently it is necessary to concen-
trate the heat required to harden small

objects quickly. The relatively low cur-
rent from the generator is stepped up
by a transformer with any turns on the
primary and few on the secondary. The
secondary currently is passed through
the inductor, usually consisting of one
turn, which induces a high current in
the charge, With this method the heat-
ing coil is called a "focus" or energy-
concentrating inductor.
The applications of induction heating
are many and varied. When the job
to be done is well nigh impossible by
customary methods induction heating
usually takes over. Very frequently
hardening by ordinary methods involves
a long and expensive process, which
induction heating can speed up, reduce
the cost, and improve the quality. One
such case was a one-quarter-inch shaft
ll/2 inches long. The central portion
was to be hardened for a bearing sur-
face while the ends were to be unaffect-
ed that they might be riveted over to
hold the shaft in place. Originally this
job was done by copper-plating the ends
and then case hardening the exposed
middle by carburizing—all of which
took time and money. A small coil was
wound which was approximately the
length of the desired hardened area.
The shaft was centered in the coil and
the whole immersed in water. About
four kilowatts of power at 500,000
cycles was applied to the coil. As the
steel heated up, a film of steam formed,
from the cooling action of the water.
When the power was removed this
vapor envelope collapsed, allowing the
water to rapidly quench the shaft. The

entire cycle of heat and quench was
complete in 3% seconds and a satis-
factorily hardened area resulted.
Internal surface hardening by induc-
tion heating has produced a case more
durable, deeper, and more uniform con-
centrically than nitriding made possible.
Also, since there is no composition
change in the treatment, the hardened
surface does not flake off.
A shallow layer of the internal sur-
face, usually not more than a few thou-
sandths of an inch thick, is quickly
brought to a high temperature by caus-
ing large induced high-frequency cur-
rents to circulate in it. Before this
heat can creep inward to any appre-
ciable depth, the currents are stopped
and the surface is quenched with water.
A hard, wear-resisting surface is pro-
duced without disturbing the toughness,
ductility, machineability, and dimen-
sions of the main body.
The high-frequency power is deliv-
ered by a motor-driven generator at 200
to 1000 volts. This power is supplied
the heating head, a copper tube coiled
around an iron core, all on a mandrel.
Cooling water is circulated through the
tubing since current densities reach as
high as 200,000 amperes per square
inch. The quenching device is designed
to follow the heating head and timing
is adjusted to supply quench at the
proper time in the cycle.
It is not practical to harden bores
less than one inch in diameter simply
because of the difficulty of designing
suitable heating and quenching fixtures.

Also, when the bore is large, power re-
quirements are too large to be practical.
For example, at 10,000 cycles an inter-
nal surface can be hardened with about
40 kw-seconds per square inch. A sur-
face IS inches in diameter requires
about 2,000 kw-seconds per inch of
length. If the bore is long, and since
the heat treatment must be effected at
high speed, the generating plant would
be too large. A IS inch bore is accepted
as the upper limit.
One of the first large-scale surface
hardening processes to be carried out
is hardening the inside surface of auto-
mobile wheel hubs. The hubs are steel
forgings, and the bore is hardened to
provide an integral race for roller bear-
ings. The operation is done in truly
automotive fashion; normal production
is 180 hubs per machine per hour and
can be stepped up to 240, with the
complete cycle requiring but 20 seconds
(Continued from page 20)
at the 180 rate. Hardness varies be-
tween 60 and 62 Rockwell C and pen-
tration is about 0.10 inch. More than
five million hubs have been used with
no reports of failure.
To harden the inside of long objects
such as oil-well pipe, the heating and
quenching tool is drawn progressively
through the bore. The heat-treating
head, about two inches long, is pulled
through the pipe at the rate of one or
two inches per second, hardening in one
continuous operation. Power require-
ments are approximately 100 kw per
inch of bore diameter.
Internal hardening of airplane cylin-
ders by induction heating has resulted
in high production rates, as many as
500 uniformly hardened cylinder bar-
rels per day per machine being turned
out. Final hardness is 62-64 Rockwell C.
The first commercial installation of
induction heating applied to tin plating

Large Induction Heating Coil
Courtfiy oj Wtstingfiouse
is now producing about 60 tons a day
of 14 inch strip. High-frequency heat-
ing equipment is being designed to op-
erate at speeds up to 1000 feet per
minute, while gas furnaces are limited
to ISO f.p.m. and hot oil to 50 f.p.m.
The inductor heater coil is rectangu-
lar in form, wound as close to the strip
as mechanically possible. It acts as the
primary of a transformer while the strip
itself constitutes a single turn short-
circuited secondary. Within 0.7 second
after the previously electrolytically
plated strip enters the heating coil, the
temperature is brought up to 450° F,
where the tin melts and the minute
peaks flow into the valleys. Only a
few feet of line travel are necessary to
produce sufficient heat when the strip
is traveling at 1000 feet per minute.
With induction heating, the power
input and speed of travel determine the
heat developed. When the speed of
the line is changed, as during periods
of acceleration and deceleration when
two coils of steel are welded end to end,
the power input may be adjusted rap-
idly and automatically to accommodate
the variation.
A split pipe-threading die can be
hardened simultaneously on both the
inside and outside surfaces, leaving a
soft, tough core. The heating coil is
placed over the outside surface. How-
ever, since the die is split the induced
currents must flow over the inside sur-
face before returning to the outside to
follow the necessary continuous path.
Thus both the inside and outside sur-
faces are heated.
Controlled temperatures of 3600° C
have been attained in induction fur-
naces. The limit to the temperature
possible occurs when the heat insulation
fails or the charge vaporizes. While
high-temperature applications have not
been numerous, the future is wide open.
Carbides are being made with induction
heating, and the vaporization separation
of metals offers interesting possibilities.
Although great progress has been
made with this method of heating, new
applications are being made available,
and present methods of heat treatment
are being discarded in favor of induction
heating throughout industry. Its future
development is forecast by its present
accomplishments.

casting of sections of the ship and as-
sembling them in the ship basin. This
method requires large cranes and equip-
ment and offers no advantage over the
monolithic method. In the monolithic
method the ship is moulded in a con-
tinuous pouring operation and, conse-
quently, the finished product is free of
the danger of poor joints or non-homo-
geneity. Since the latter method was
used most it will be discussed here.
The forms of the ship were erected
with reinforcing bars properly placed
between forms, after which concrete
was poured between the forms and
around the bars. The shell thickness
averaged about 3 or 4 inches so that
accurate placing of the bars was neces-
sary because it was difficult to make
the concrete surround all the bars. This
difficulty was overcome, however, by
completely erecting the outer forms and
erecting the inner forms in stages as
construction progressed.
Concrete is a plastic material while
being worked and, consequently, can
be moulded to conform to any curva-
ture of surface so that theoretically any
type of hull could be easily adopted.
The placing of the reinforcing bars,
however, grows more intricate as the
curvature of the ship increases, and
since the bending of the steel bars re-
quires extra operations, it was decided
in this country to adopt the straight
line design. It was also felt that
straight frame construction would be
more sound because the effect of throw-
ing the concrete off of the curved bars,
as the bars tended to straighten out
under tension, was reduced.
Reinforcing bars varying from % to
2a/o inches in diameter were the same
grade used in steel ship construction.
The bars were properly located within
the outer forms and usually held in
place by wiring, or other mechanical
means. Welding was not as far ad-
vanced as it is today and would have
increased construction costs consider-
ably.
The reinforcing bars for the keel-
sons, frames, side girders, and floors,
were all placed at the same time as the
bars for the shell, and the concrete was
poured over them in the same opera-
tion. After pouring the shell, the bars
for deck girders and beams were ar-
ranged, common practice being to run
the hatch coamings the length of the
ship so that they contributed to the
longitudinal strength of the vessel. The
decks were then poured in the same
manner as the shell. The ships were
generally longitudinally framed with
large webs spaced about every 12 feet.
The ships had as many watertight bulk-
heads as could practically be arranged.
These were fitted not only for safety
but also for the purpose of resisting tor-
sional stresses.

EVER wonder how Fred Allen man-
ages to ride into millions of homes
every week and emerge life-size and full-
voiced from radio loud speakers?
The "horse" he rides is a big radio trans-
mission tube like the one shown above.
One reason it carries him smoothly and
without interruption is that Coining re-
search has perfected a glass for radio
tubes that will stand heat and voltage of
modern transmission.
Corning furnishes glass for the tubes in
your own radio set, too. Just as it fur-
nishes glass for many of your lamp
bulbs; for the Pyrex cooking utensils in
the kitchen back home. But to many, and
particularly to the man who is making
engineering bis life work, Corning re-
search is most interesting because of the
things it has discovered that glass can
do in competition with other materials,
and do better. Glass springs, for instance,
that apparently never tire out. Glass acid
pumps that replace valuable metal alloys
and give longer service in the bargain!
Glass piping, and valves, nuts and bolts
that resist chemical attack. Every day
Corning is working on ways in which
glass, still fairly plentiful, can be used to
replace metals that are vital to war in-
dustry.
Glass is important today. And as more is
discovered about this remarkable
material, no one can predict the
boundaries of its usefulness. For
instance, glass precision gauges
(ring, plug and others) are now being
produced that are in many ways superior
to ones made of steel.
As you get further into engineering, keep
an eye on glass. The greatest things in
glass are yet to come. Corning Glass

Longitudinal strength calculations
were carried out in the same manner as
for steel vesels but large factors of
safety were used. Bending moments
were calculated for the usual trochoidal
wave with a length equal to the ship's
length and a height of 1/20 this length.
The steel bars were placed in the bot-
tom shell and deck to take the tension
in the sagging and hogging conditions.
It was considered that the bars in the
side shell took none of this tension.
Working stresses for the steel bars
uually ran about 5 or 6 tons per square
inch and never exceeded 8 tons per
square inch. The concrete was con-
sidered to take all the compression with
working stresses around 700 to 800
pounds per square inch.
Longitudinal shear was calculated
and assumed to be taken up wholly by
the side shell, necessitating additional
reinforcing bars at the points of maxi-
mum shear. In some cases these bars
were placed diagonally so that while
resisting shear the bars were in tension.
In some cases however the steel was
considered to resist shear more effec-
tively if it was arranged in a net-like
pattern so that the shear was taken up
by longitudinal and vertical bars at the
same time. It was considered that the
latter method was more economical.
Transverse strength was also calcu-
lated for the ship situated in a wave
hollow and on a crest longitudinally
and for the ship in dry dock docked
on the center keelson.
Because of the inelastic properties of
concrete, larger factors of safety had to
be used for the steel; if the concrete
should crack in service the bars might
be subject to corrosion, and leaks, cor-
rosion being the most serious. If the
cracks were large enough the ship might
leak, although the former case would
prove far more disastrous than the
latter. The designers felt that if the
ships could be observed under actual
sea conditions, more could be discov-
ered about their resistance to local
stresses, and scantlings could be re-
duced considerably in many places.
However, the risk of lives and cargo for
the sake of a slight increase in efficiency
was unwarranted.
Perhaps the most difficult problem in
construction of concrete ships was the
fitting of the stern frame and shaft
bosings. The stern frame had to be of
steel in order to hold the rudder, and
this portion of the ship was subject to
the greatest local stresses and vibra-
tions. The reinforcing bars were se-
curely fastened to the stern frames
by welding or mechanical means. On
the larger ships such as the M. S. Aske-
lad twin screw arrangements were used
so that the size of the stern frame was
reduced considerably and the bossings
were formed of concrete.
Places subject to wear and abrasion
such as hatch coamings and hawser
openings had to be additionally pro-
tected in order to prevent exposing the
steel bars by the wearing away of the
concrete. Wood fenders were always
present on concrete ships to protect the
hull from sharp blows that would pos-
sibly result in cracking of the concrete.
On the first concrete vessels the deck
houses were constructed of wood. This
practice was soon abandoned, however,
because it is impossible to form a water-
tight bond between wood and concrete.
All the later concrete vessels and con-
crete houses which added considerably
to the height of the hull, while it con-
tributed nothing to its strength.
The time required to build a rein-
forced concrete vessel is generally less
than that for a steel ship of the same
size. The concrete ship must weather
for 28 days, however, before being put
into service, but this weathering can be
done after launching so that it would
not impede the progress of further con-
struction.
Concrete vessels built during the last
war ranged all the way from small
lighters and barges to cargo ships of
3000 tons dead weight, including tank-
ers. In fact, the concrete ship lends
itself particularly well to carrying oil.
This is true because of the exception-
ally heavy hull which must be made
quite large for a given dead weight
capacity. Since oil is a light cargo, this
extra cubic capacity can be put to prac-
tical use.
Other concrete ships built during the
last war included tugs, lighters, coal
freighters, and even sailing ships and
dry docks. In all these vesels complete
soundness of structure was reported by
the operators. One of the outstanding
characteristics they repeatedly men-
tioned was the low cost of upkeep)—
about 1/5 the cost of upkeep of a
steel ship of the same dead weight.

PROFESSIONAL ETHICS
HERE is the fifth in the professional
ethics series. For the best answer
to this problem the writer will again
receive $5. Have your entry in to the
Technic office on or before April 5.
PROBLEM
Mr. Fuller is a consulting engineer of
long standing in the design and con-
struction of cargo vesels. At one time
earlier in his career he was in the em-
ployment of the Ajax Engineering Com-
pany as a designer and evaluator and
is now a very close friend of the presi-
dent of that firm.
A recent job for which he was called
in as a consulting engineer was with
the Imperial Construction Company,
who are building a cargo vessel for the
Merchant Marine. While at work on
this project it was called to his atten-
tion that some detail designing and
construction would be subcontracted to
a smaller firm to speed production and
he was asked to refer some responsible
firm to them to handle this part of the
project. Mr. Fuller referred them to
the Ajax Engineering Company. In
due time the project was completed
satisfactorily to all concerned and the
Ajax Engineering Company received
$20,000 for their work, which was ex-
ceptionally well done.
Some weeks after the completion of
the cargo vessel, the Imperial Con-
struction Company receives a large con-
tract of a million dollars for the con-
struction of a series of vessels of an
entirely different design from anything
they have ever done before. Mr. Fuller,
the consulting engineer, is again called
in to assist on the project. The urgent
demand for the ships makes it manda-
tory that a great deal of the detail de-
sign be subcontracted. At this time Mr.
Fuller receives a check for $1,000 from
the Ajax Engineering Company with a
letter accompanying it stating that they
would appreciate any effort expended
by Mr. Fuller on their behalf What ac-
tion should Mr. Fuller take?

You CAN SEE why metalworkers call this lump of
calcium metal a "carrot." This is the way it looks
when it comes from an electrolytic cell in which it
is made.
Calcium is a soft, silvery-looking metal. Although
it is ahundantly present in such common materials
as chalk and limestone, its recovery as a pure metal
is extremely diflicult. Yet it is vitally essential to
this country.
In the making of stainless or high-alloy steels, cal-
cium drives out impurities, giving cleaner, hctter
steel for easting or rolling. In magnesium casting,
small amounts of calcium improve the finish of the
surface and minimize scaling. Calcium is an essential
in the making of many metals.
This hitherto rare metal has been made in this
country only during the past few years. Before Eu-
rope exploded, the United States was dependent
upon France as a source of supply.
Bui hack as far as 1935, thinking that this country
should have a domestic source, ELECTRO METAL-
LURGICAL COMPANY, a unit of UCC, started a major
research program. After four years of work ... as
French supplies dwindled ... a plant was put into
operation for the manufacture of the gray metal.

many times as much calcium metal as this country
ever imported . . . and production is increasing.

PREP SCHOOL COLLEGES?
SINCE the entrance of the United
States into World War II, much
thought and discussion has been de-
voted to the function of colleges and
universities in present day war activ-
ity. Among the more important
points under consideration is the pos-
sibility of enabling young men, under
the present selective service minimum
age requirement, to acquire at least
a part of their college educations
before being subject to military train-
ing. This means admitting students
to colleges and universities before ful-
filling the requirements of a high
school diploma.
Naturally, educators have not
agreed on the advisability of such a
step, the pros and cons have been
debated from every angle. In many
schools such as the University of
Chicago—Chicago's President Hutch-
ins was one of the first advocates of
this change—sometimes radical inno-
vations have already been instituted.
Many smaller liberal arts schools
virtually facing slow death if a plan
such as this is not adopted, have al-
ready opened their doors to high
school students—in some cases even
fifteen-year-olds. Other schools—
Michigan among them—are experi-
menting with high school seniors
selected from the top ranks of their
classes.
But, are such steps necessary and
advisable? Are these schools that
are faced with the possibility of
empty classrooms taking such action
for the benefit of the country or for
themselves?
Educators argue that the future of
the world and the successful attain-
ment of a satisfactory post-war world
is in the hands of educated men.
But, does this necessarily mean men
who have spent a few months in col-
leges? Does it mean these men who
are taken from high schools will be
able to absorb a college education
before they are put into the armed
forces?
It is foolish to assume that the
average student who is admitted to
college before graduation from high

Recently we were deeply moved
to learn of the death of one of our
fellow engineers, George Hilde-
brandt.
A member of the class of '43,
George was limited in his outside
activities by the fact that he was
working his way through school.
However, he did find time to par-
ticipate in football, being on the
team for three years straight. Handi-
capped by injuries which plagued
him these three years, George did
not see much action, though he gave
his all to the sport.
Phi Delta Theta fraternity claimed
him for a brother, and honored him
by electing him president of the
house last summer and this fall.
It will not be easy to forget
George, and we of the Technic
staff would like to join with the en-
tire engineering college in expressing
our heart-felt sympathy to his par-
ents and friends.
school will be able to begin college
as a high school graduate. He will
not only lack the necessary funda-
mental training: he will lack the
proper attitude. Study hours, dor-
mitories, rules and regulations will
all be necessary. Colleges will re-
vert to overgrown prep schools and
standards of education will hit rock
bottom.
Would it not be more logical to
keep these students in their present
schools and, there, increase the aca-
demic standards by offering more
comprehensive courses and compell-
ing students to attend classes twelve
months out of the year? Most high
schools are sufficiently well staffed
and equipped to make such a meas-
ure possible. Thus the necessary
supervision could be maintained at a
minimum of expense and effort, while
the training offered would be essen-
tially the same as that offered in
fundamental college courses.
Because of ever increasing neces-
sity for specialization, it is obvious
that in the future—war or no war—
a speeded up educational program
will be necessary. But if plans such
as those advocated at the present
time are to be successful, prepara-
tion of students must begin in the
elementary schools. Frills and non-
essentials must be eliminated to make
way for training which will enable
them to intelligently select the field
of concentration for which they are
best suited, and to assume a mature
attitude in order to master the the-
ories which now are considered ad-
vanced, but which in the future will
be fundamental.

Several means are being applied industrially to save
time and reduce fatigue oi welders working on heavy
jobs. Positioning tables, rotating jigs and similar de-
vices ior handling heavy or bulky assemblies are
quite generally used.
One aircraft manufacturer has adopted a similar
idea for welders working on small sub-assemblies.
The assemblies are light, and joints are usually quite
accessible. But moving the assemblies by hand does
occasion some delay.
This is obviated by mounting the work on a small
turn table somewhat resembling an old style potter's
wheel. The turn table is quite simple, consisting of
two round plates mounted on a common shaft.
The upper plate carries the work, and is located
at a convenient height above a work table. The lower
plate is a few inches above the shop floor. It is posi-
tioned so that the operator's feet rest on it comfor-
tably.
Thus, when the operator wishes to move the work,
he simply "indexes" the lower table by foot power.
The weight of his feet on the plate is. however, suffi-
cient to hold the whole turn table steady while he is
welding any particular joint.

... With building materials at a pre-
mium, American industry has had to
find not only substitutes for vital ma-
terials, but also methods of reclaiming
scarce materials.
In the past steel girders were used
almost exclusively in building large
structures. Now, wooden laminated
girders, made of glued wood sheets are
being used. Recently six arches, 71
feet long were made from 26,000 board
feet, 1590 pounds of glue, and 10 pounds
of synthetic resin sealer. These arches,
weighing 2 tons apiece, are superior to
steel arches in a number of ways. First,
they handle easily, being lighter than
steel. Second, in a fire steel beams will
buckle and fail while wood will char and
provide a longer fire resistant period.
... Steel corrugated sheets are as scarce
as hen's teeth, but a new corrugated as-
phalt siding has been developed. This
sheet is made of two sheets of heavy felt
saturated with resino-bituminous com-
pound. These two sheets are bound
together with a high melting point
asphalt adhesive and then pressed to
form a corrugated sheet at high pres-
sure. The resulting siding is light,
hard, and moisture resistant. In hot
weather, the sheets do not become soft,
and their life can be prolonged by
painting.
The main advantage is that no criti-
cal materials are used.
... Soap is being used in making con-
crete highways scale-resistant. In the
winter sodium chloride and calcium
chloride are spread on the streets to
remove ice. When these chemicals
come in contact with concrete, surface
scaling results. Although experimental
work is still being conducted, it has
been shown that soap actually does
minimize this effect. ... 14,800 tons of
iron and steel scrap was shipped to steel
mills during 1942. This amount was
&amp;7% of the quota of 17,000,000 tons.

used by large aircraft factories to sort
rivets dropped on the floor. This new
machine consists of a battery of four
units: a revolving perforated cylinder
which groups the rivets according to
thickness, a hopper which places them
head-up on a selector, a circular selector
which classifies them according to length,
and a bank of needles which kick the
rivets into their proper channels.
... Rubber, almost as rare as caviar to
the average American, is still a big
problem. With the Far East supplies
cut off, there are four sources: natural
rubber from Latin America and Liberia,
synthetic rubber, reclaimed rubber, and
rubber grown in America from Guayule.
In 1942 Liberia did little better than
8.000 tons while Brazil's total was
about 40,000 tons. The synthetic sup-
ply may yield 400,000 tons by the end
of this year. Reclaimed rubber was
about 350,000 tons in 1942, but this
source must be expected to decrease
soon. After returning to the mill four
times, rubber is unusable. If guayule
is harvested from American and Mexi-
can deserts, 7,000 tons per year is ex-
pected. However, if these plants are
planted, a two year crop would yield
550,000 tons.
... Invar, a 36% nickel alloy, can now
be machined with ease by the addition
of selenium. It has been reported that
a saving of 72% in machining time can
be realized. Invar is important for its
low coefficient of thermal expansion; the
addition of selenium does not alter this
characteristic.
... A steel ball that will not bounce has
finally been developed. The ball, which
is hollow, is filled with a metallic powder
whose volume is equal to half the vol-
ume of the hollow portion. When the
ball is dropped, energy is dissipated as
frictional heat caused by the small par-
ticles sliding over each other. This type
of steel ball is being used on electrical
relays to stop bouncing.

(Continued from page 5)
Before the advent of the present na-
tional emergency a company in Illinois
had designed a reclamation building and
a runway which called for the use of
165 tons of structural steel. When the
application was made to the W.P.B. for
the required tonnage of steel, it was
denied. As a result a second design was
made which included a smaller tempor-
ary reclamation building and precast
concrete supports for the runway. The
building, built almost entirely of ma-
sonry and wood timbers, required only
a small amount of steel. The only steel
used on the runway was the structural
steel used on the crane, and the runway
girders and reinforcing steel for the
concrete supports. With this design the
allotted tonnage of reinforcing steel far
exceeded the tonnage required.
Cast on the base of each support is a
15 in. channel which rests on and is an-
chored to the concrete foundation. This
permitted the correct alignment of each
precast concrete support on its respec-
tive foundation and made it easy to
maintain the alignment of the girders
and the gauge of the runway.
After the concrete foundation for the
supports had been placed, with the bolts
in position, wooden forms built of ply-
wood were made with the idea in mind
of convenient assembly and quick re-
moval for re-use. A platform, with a
plywood surface built to conform with
the triangular shape of the support was
placed at the foundation of the first
support in a horizontal position. The

channel were anchored to it. The con-
crete was then placed in the form under
the influence of a high-frequency elec-
tric driven vibrator. As soon as the con-
crete had sufficiently hardened the form
was removed and moved to the next
position where another plywood-sur-
faced platform had been built. After
sufficient time had allowed for seasoning
the supports were raised by a large
crane.
. .. Munitions production will be speed-
ed up in the next year by the use of
X-rays. Zinc die castings have not been
used in making shells before because the
slightest crack or flaw may lead to a
pre-mature explosion. Now, by use of
these recently perfected X-ray "examin-
ers" imperfections can be detected sim-
ply and efficiently.
. . . Although in America there is an
acute copper shortage, the Axis is hav-
ing a much harder time. Italy, for in-
stance, is burning the leaves from vines
that have been sprayed with copper sul-
fate. They manage to reclaim five
pounds of precious copper per acre.
Occupied France requires vineyard
keepers to turn in one pound of copper
in exchange for one pound of copper sul-
fate. Their generosity does not stop
there, however; to every good French-
man the government gives one liter of
wine for 200 grams (.44 pounds) of cop-
per. All statues have been scrapped
yielding 500 tons of copper.
From Holland come letters with such
comments as "The Kettle family is tak-
ing a long holiday" or "Mr. C. Kettle's
funeral took place." Most Hollanders
prefer to bury their copper kettles rather
than turn them over to the Germans.
. . . The standard Army bugle is out for
the duration with the advent of a plastic
substitute. This plastic bugle weighing
only ten ounces, is diverting 2 pounds
of metal per horn to war industries. The
olive drab color is contained in the plas-
tic itself and hence, it needs no paint to
keep its finish. Tests have shown that
the bugle is not affected by temperature
changes, and will not chip or dent.
Modern improvements in the opera-
tion of hydraulic presses have enable
munitions manufacturers to attain a
high degree of accuracy at a low ex-
penditure of time. These presses play
an important role in today's war pro-
duction of shell casings and gun barrels.
In the last war the cavities in shells
were punched roughly and then ma-
chined to finished sizes. Today this
same step is accomplished in one opera-
tion. Thus, there is a large saving of
time and expense.
The following improvements were
made after careful analysis. It was
found that an extremely stiff press was
required, that the punch guide must be
highly accurate and that the billet must
be located in the exact center of the die.
It was^also found advantageous to have
the flow of the metal in the opposite di-
rection to the travel of the punch. These
improvements have enabled forgings to
be turned out at an overall tooling cost
of only ten cents per shell. At the same
time ther eare very few defective forg-
ings produced.
The illustration shows a 2000 ton
forging press which is used to forge gun
barrels. In this machine there are three
fluid systems allowing variations in
pressure from 80 psi for economy up
to 2000 psi, the maximum pressure. The
medium pressure system requires the
use of a sixty horsepower motor while
the high pressure system requires a 600
horsepower motor. The press has a dual
control for either forging or planishing.
A small 30 ton hydraulic press finds
extensive use in straightening gun bar-
rels. Although primarily designed for
use on gun barrels, it will no doubt see
extensive use in the future in straighten-
ing steel bars, pipes, and structural
shapes.

PATRIOTISM
oW GOOD SENSE
Of course every one is willing to do without the essential materials that
help win the war; everybody knows zinc and steel are among those
materials. And of course it is just good common sense to take care of the
things we have, including galvanized roofing, to make them last as long
as possible and give the best service.
H l
HOW TO CONSERVE
GALVANIZED ROOFING
You'll find galvanized roofing of various types used
on all kinds of structures, on farms, in industrial
plants, in housing. It is a valuable material, and
with proper care it can be made to last a long, long
time; anyhow, until the war is over and necessary
replacement material is available.
2)0 ^Uti...
See that all the roof supports are in good shape. If
necessary renail and strengthen them, and replace
broken or rotted members.
And ^Uu ...
Then bring all the separate sheets into as close
alignment as possible. If moisture has a tendency
to creep through at the laps, lay a strand of asbestos
wicking between the sheets at the laps, and renail
the roofing with an approved type of zinc-coated
lead-seal special roofing nail with a drive-screw
shank. Stubborn lap openings can be effectively
closed with hardware screws.
And *1ku...
If any of the roofing is showing signs of rusting,
paint it with two coats of metallic zinc paint, (see
Federal Specifications TT-P-641) which will effec-
tively stop the rust and prevent further injury to
the roofing. In fact, the use of this remarkably good
paint, which can be readily made by any paint
manufacturer, will extend the life of galvanized
roofing almost indefinitely.
In "How To Male Galvanized Roofing Last Longer", a
booklet published by the Institute, complete and explicit
directions are given for all oi the above operations.
Copies will be sent free upon request.

Galvanized sheets constitute one
of the most popular forms of roof-
ing for farm buildings of all kinds.
Everything considered, they are
also the most economical.

In industrial establishments,
where efficiency and economy of
materials are of prime impor-
tance, galvanizedsheetsarewidely
used for various types of struc-
tures, from modest homes for em-
ployees to the largest of manu-
facturing plants.


A GOOD engineer should be familiar
with the various tools at his dis-
posal and know their advantages and
limitations. Among his tools should be
the various rules for integration. The
most common are the Trapezoidal Rule,
the several Simpson's Rules, and
Tchebycheff's Rule. The use of these
rules seems to be neglected by most
branches of engineering. Only the Naval
Architect uses them to any extent and
even he does not seem to fully realize
their potentialities.
Part of the reluctance of the engineer
to make use of such rules may be due
to his feeling that the rules are approxi-
mations. It is the purpose of this brief
article to show the assumptions made in
their derivations and so their limita-
tions, and to describe their applications,
to some problems which are difficult to
solve by the usual means, in the hope
that other applications may be seen.
An integral rule, or rule for integra-
tion, may be defined as the arithmetical
operations which must be performed
upon the ordinates of a curve, which
ordinates are at certain definite inter-
vals fixed by the rule used, to give the
area under the curve, or in mathemati-
cal terms, knowing y,, y2, y3 etc., at xu
T„ x3 of the curve y== f (x) the method
of arriving at the result
yd:
Y
ydx. The
x,
ordinates may have been determined
either by measurement from the curve
at the required intervals or as a result
of other calculation.
The Trapezoidal Rule
Tre trapezoidal rule assumes that the
ordinates are equally spaced and that
the curve between any two ordinates is
a straight line. For accuracy the curve
must therefore be quite flat between
ordinates, or, which results in the same
thing, that the ordinates are closely
spaced. If yj and y. are the values of
the ordinates at x, and x,, respectively,
hereafter referred to as stations 1 and 2,
then the area between any two ordi-
nates = y' "t~y* x S, where S is the

Henry C. Adams,
Professor of Naval Architecture
and Marine Engineering
station spacing. The portion of the
curve between 1 and 2 may be called the
integral group or unit. If the spacing of
each unit is constant, then the total
area, A, becomes the sum of the area
of the units or:
A=(^+y2 + /2yn)S.
If the curve under consideration has
sharp changes in curvature at certain
points, subdivided intervals may be used
in the region of the sharp change, rather
than increasing the work incidental to
a closer spacing of the ordinates
throughout.

In Fig. 1, the spacing S, if used over
the entire curve, will give a nearly cor-
rect value for the area between stations
2 and 4; it will underestimate the area
between 1 and 2, and overestimate it
between 0 and 1. In the figure as drawn
the excess from 0 to 1 about balances
the deficiency between 1 and 2. This,
however, will not always be the case.
If the space O to 1 is divided by sta-
tion y2 and 1 to 2 by \]/i, it will be
seen that the errors are reduced. Then
The area 0/V2 = ( y" + y5 ) x S/2, and
the areas yi to 1, 1 to lY&gt;, \y2 to 2,
2 to 3, and 3 to 4 will be of the same
form.
Total Area A =
S(V4yo + y2y., + i/2y,s + %y2 \ y3
+ /2y4)
Simpson's Rules
There are two rules known as Simp-
son's Rule, the first and the second.
These rules assume that the curve
throughout an integral unit is a para-
bola. The first rule assumes it to be one
of the second degree, and the second,
one of the third degree. The integral
unit in the first rule is two equal inter-
vals or three stations; the second rule
uses three equal intervals or four sta-
tions.
The derivation of Simpson's First
Rule is given in the appendix of Att-
wood and Pengelly, Theoretical Naval
Architecture to which the reader is
referred for the details of the deriva-
tion. The assumptions made are:
1. The boundary curve over any in-
tegral unit is a parabola of the second
degree;
2. The ordinates are equally spaced;
and
3. An integral unit is that portion of
the area between alternate ordinates—
i.e., two intervals.
By assuming that the rule should
have the form Ay, + By. + Cy3 to
give the area of an integral unit and
determining the area of a unit by inte-
grating the equation of the curve, the
coefficients A, B and C are evaluated
and found to be
A=1/3S
B = 4/3 S
C = 1/3 S, where S is the station
spacing. Thus the expression for the
area of an integral unit is
(yi + 4y,, + ys) x S/3 — where y
represents the ordinates at stations 1,
2, and 3 as indicated by the respective
subscripts, and S is the station spac-
ing. Several integral units with the
same station spacing may be combined
and the expression for the total area
becomes: (y,-f 4y2 -f 2y3 + 4y4 . . . .
4Yn-i + yn) x S/3 where n is an odd
number. If a parabola of the third de-
gree is assumed, it is found that the co-
efficients A, B, and C are the same. The
rule is therefore applicable to either type
of curve.
Part of the reluctance of engineers to
use the rule may be due to their failure
to so arrange the work as to simplify
and coordinate the arithmetical opera-
tions. Such work is best done by using
a tabular form, as will be illustrated in
the following examples which, by apply-
ing the rule to mathematical curves,
will also give an idea of their accuracy.

OF POLYSTYRENE
By
Lloyd C. Danielson, '43E
POLYSTYRENE, a clear transparent
resin obtained from polymerization
of monomeric styrene, is one of the most
recent of the plastics to acquire an eco-
nomic significance. Although it has
been known to science for over a hun-
dred years, it was not introduced as a
transparent plastic in this country until
1937, when new developments made pos-
sible the production of a pure material
in large quantities. Yet even as late as
1939 the use of polystyrene ranked low
in relation to other plastic substances.
The water-white monomer from which
polystyrene is derived was isolated by
Bonastre in 1931. He produced it from
the distillation of storax, a purified form
of balsam. This balsam was a grayish-
brown, honey-like liquid containing pri-
marily resin, styrene, and cinnamic acid,
taken from the bark of a tree known as
the "Liquidamber Orientalis" found
mostly in the region southwest of Asi-
atic Turkey. The balsam was very fra-
grant, and was used principally in per-
fumery.
The thermal polymerization of mono-
meric styrene by the action of sunlight
was initially observed in 1839 by Simon,
who named the resulting resin "Styro-
loxyd" because he thought it to be a
result of the oxidation process. Later,
Blythe and Hoffman gave the first clear
description of the chemical, but prog-
ress with the material remained slow.
It was not until 1869 that the ethyl-
benzene process for producing styrene
was discovered by the French chemist,
Berthelot, and not until thirty-one years
later, in 1900, that commercial possi-
bilities were apparently first envisioned.
In that year Kronstein, describing poly-
merized styrene as "organic glass", indi-
cated its use in the preparation of var-
nishes.
Eleven years later Doctor F. E. Mat-
thews of London was granted two im-
portant patents disclosing several uses.
In these he pointed out the excellent
insulating properties of polymerized sty-
rene and indicated its use in place of
celluloid, wood and glass in the manu-
facturing of various articles. He noted
that mixed with rubber it imparted
hardness and toughness, a fact which
led him to suggest its use in the crea-
tion of wear and high temperature re-
sistant motor car tires.
Others were quick to follow in the
steps of these pioneers, and as a result
considerable attention was given to
polystyrene. But the processes then
known were highly complex and expen-
sive and demanded a price that he mar-
ket would not meet. Still another
difficulty was encountered in the seem-
ing impossibility of fabricating a pure
product that would withstand the deteri-
orating effects of the atmosphere.
The commercial development of poly-
styrene was nearly forgotten when the
war began in 1914, although both dur-
ing and after the war considerable de-
velopment work was done with the ma-
terial in Germany.
In 1922 Dufraisse and Moureu dis-
covered agents which would retard poly-
merization of styrene so that it could be
shipped for redistillation and further
polymerizing. This proved to be the
turning point in European production of
polystyrene, and it was not long before
German industry began commercial
manufacture of the material.
It was not until 1933 that American
interest in polystyrene was reawakened
to any considerable extent and that do-
mestic manufacturers once more began
to investigate it. At last they were able
to solve enough of its problems to give
it a place among the growing list of

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


1937, for the first time after nearly a
hundred years of research, American
companies were able to produce a pure
material of high quality in commercial
quantity at a price comparing favorably
with that of other plastic materials.
The chemistry of styrene production,
while beset by many problems in prac-
tice, is in theory quite simple.
The first problem in the production
of styrene lay in the conversion of the
ethyl-benzene to monomeric styrene.
The ethyl-benzene, upon formation, was
chlorinated to yield a mixture of alpha
and beta chloroethylbenzene. The beta
Accordingly much research was car-
ried out in an attempt to eliminate the
chlorination process, and finally a proc-
ess of pyrolysis was evolved, by which
the hydrogen was "cracked" from the
ethylbenzene, thus leaving a crude form
of styrene which contained a high per-
centage of the coveted monomeric, pure
styrene.
The next step was the separation of
the styrene from the other products of
pyrolysis. This purification was a tedi-
ous problem, but eventually it was dis-
covered that a carefully controlled
distillation accomplished the desired
end, and resulted in the pure form of
trolling factor in the determination of
the physical properties of polystyrene.
By varying the rate and duration of
polymerization, diverse physical prop-
erties may be produced, thereby giving
polystyrene a wider range of applica-
bility than any other form of plastic.
The rate of reaction decreases as the
concentration of styrene in the mixture
and catalyst decreases, and increases
with a higher concentration of styrene.
The catalysts, those generally used be-
ing benzoyl peroxide, oxygen or stannic
chloride, may increase the rate of re-
action, but the resulting polymers will
be of lower chain length than those pro-

compound was separated and hydro-
lyzed to give betaphenylethyl alcohol,
which was then dehydrated with an al-
kali to yield a relatively pure styrene.
There is a fundamental fault with
this process, arising out of the fact that
the chlorination of ethylbenzene nor-
mally yields a mixture of monochloro-
ethylbenzenes very high in the alpha
compound. Before the production of
styrene could be accomplished on any
substantial scale at a reasonable cost,
the yield of styrene from both the alpha
and beta compounds had to be materi-
ally increased.
monomeric styrene needed to produce
the polymer. The product of distilla-
tion, monomeric styrene, was a liquid.
To change this liquid to the solid form
polymerization was employed. Poly-
merization is the enlarging of the mole-
cule, or the increasing of its weight, to
many times its original size or weight
until it becomes viscous and hard. The
resultant polymer may then be com-
pounded, colored, ground, screened, etc.,
to whatever form desired by the manu-
facturer.
Polymerization is not only the means
for creating a usable product from
monomeric styrene, but is also the con-
duced without catalysts at any given
temperature.
Added control of physical properties
may be had through the addition of
plasticizers, but there is little gained
through the use of these added agents.
The various ranges of desired flow can
be obtained quite satisfactorily through
the molecular control exercised by the
polymerization process. The use of
small amounts of lubricant to improve
flow and aid in ejection of molded pieces
had been found advantageous for some
complicated molding problems. If no

Michigan
Columns of men in Army uniforms
marching to and from classes on the
campus.
A sign "U.S. Army-Restricted Area"
on the main entrance to East Quadran-
gle.
Bugle calls sounding in the Law Quad-
rangle.
These are a few of the tangible evi-
dences that the University of Michigan
is becoming one of the great centers in
the country for specialized war train-
ing programs.
But life on the campus for a student
wearing the uniform of the U. S. Army
is vastly different from the daily routine
of an ordinary student. The only resem-
blance is in the teachers. The regular
University faculty is handling the in-
struction of the Army men, except for
the actual military training.
The Army student's day starts at 6
A.M. and ends at 10:30 P.M. with ele-
ven hours of classroom, military drill,
physical education and supervision
packed into the intervening time. This
is the daily routine except on Saturdays
and Sundays. Classes end earlier on
Saturday, and Sunday is a holiday.
First call at 6 A.M. alerts the Army
students to the fact that they have 10
minutes to dress and report outdoors for
reveille. Then rooms must be cleaned
with military precision; the men must
wash and shave, have breakfast and be
ready to march to the first class of the
day at 8 A.M.
Eight o'clock classes aren't relished
too much by ordinary students at the
University, but these Army men have
eight o'clocks scheduled for every week-
day morning and get up two hours
ahead of that time to be certain they
won't arrive at the last possible second
out of breath from a frantic dash to
avoid being late.
From 8 A.M. until approximately
5 P.M., with an hour out for lunch at
noon, the Army students attend one
class after another. Military training
and PEM are interspersed on certain
mornings and afternoons to break up
the classroom routine.
The dinner hour ranges from 5:30 to
6:30 P.M., giving the men a brief re-
spite from their studies. But at 7:30
P.M. they are back at work for a per-
iod of supervised study. At 10:30 it's
"lights out" and the Army students are
back in bed storing up energy for an-
other intensive day of study.
With minor variations, this is the
daily routine for all of the Army units
receiving specialized training on the
University campus. The Judge Advo-
cate General's School, quartered in the
Law Quadrangle, varies the schedule by
one-half hour. These men get up at
6.30 A.M. and retire at 11 P.M. The
JAG School, which trains officers in
Army law ,has created a real Army post
atmosphere by installing a mechanical
bugle which summons the men to each
phase of their daily work.
Several of the other Army units are
quartered in East Quadrangle, one of
the University's residence halls for men.
The comfortable, almost luxurious, quar-

the men had become accustomed before
being transferred to the University.
Units stationed in the East Quadran-
gle include an Army Air Forces unit
receiving pre-meteorological training, an
Army Service Unit 16SS-A, and the
1694th Service Unit.

smitty
There are two places to look if you're
trying to get in touch with Keith Smith,
and neither of them is his rooming
house. For obvious reasons your best
bet is Stockwell; the second best is the
Technic office. Smitty was managing
editor and, later, editor-in-chief of the
Technic in '42 and became so attached
to the magazine (pd. adv.) that he
couldn't leave. Consequently, he's now
our star boarder.

Keith Smith
In high school at Gaylord, Michigan,
Smitty was elected president of his sen-
ior class, but not satisfied with this he
also worked his way into the valedictor-
ian slot. From there he came to Michi-
gan for, quote and unquote, the usual
reasons.
In his chosen field, Chemical Engi-
neering, Smitty hopes to do research
work in plastics after his graduation in
May. As yet, however, he hasn't ac-
cepted any offers from industry. He's
not playing hard to get—just waiting
for that ultimatum from Local Board
No. 1.
Keith might be called a psychological
engineer. Whenever engine school sub-
jects get a bit tiresome—and they often
do—he goes across campus to the halls
of culture to take a psychological course
or two. Psych is duck soup to him and
he invariably does what engineers aren't
supposed to do—get Afs in the Lit
School.
Aside from being ex-editor of the
Technic, Smitty is an active member
of A.I.Ch.E., was co-chairman of this
year's Slide Rule Ball, and last year
was tapped by Vulcans. His favorite
hobby and pastime is skiing, but lately
his spare time has been occupied by
something more important—cherchez la
femme.
not-so
Every time the phone rings at the
Lambda Chi Alpha house down Wash-
tenaw way and the familiar call of "Not-
So, on the hook!" echoes through the
halls, you know that Howard J. How-
erth is being paged. Besides this unus-
ual nickname, and the usual one of
Howie, he is known as Cadet Ensign to
the NROTC, Mr. Howerth to the Air-
craft and Ordnance Inspection classes,
and Mr. President at meetings of the
Engineering Council.
The unusual nickname of "Not-So"
required explanation, and upon quest-
ioning the following information was re-
vealed. It seems that when another Mr.
H. J. Howerth, Herbert, Howard's older
brother, pledged Lambda Chi, he earned
for himself the nickname "Hot"; conse-
quently, when a second H. J. Howerth
joined the fraternity, a nickname seemed
in order to prevent any confusion due to
identical first initials. The result was
"Not-So-Hot", which was in turn short-
ened to its present form. The identical
first initials, by the way, are a tradition
for the males of the Howerth family.
Howie is a product of Pontiac, Michi-
gan, and started preparing for an active
life while still in Pontiac High School.
There he was in the Hi-Y and Science
Club, was business manager of the
school year book, and was football and
baseball manager.
Upon graduation, Howie followed
brother Herb to Michigan where he en-
rolled in Mechanical and Industrial En-
gineering. Not content to be just another
student, he wangled his way into several
important positions during the time he
has been here. As a freshman he ob-
tained a position on the student council
of the West Quad. After a hectic cam-
paign at the beginning of his sophomore
year, "Not-So" was elected to the Engi-
neering Council for three years, serving
as its secretary during his junior year,
and as president this last semester.
The Interfraternity Council benefitted
by his services during his term as mem-
ber of the sophomore staff. This was
followed by his election to a position on
the junior staff of the Council. During
his junior year, Triangles tapped him.
At the present time he is serving as Pres-
ident of the Engineering Council, is a

Howard Howerth
member of the Engineering Council,
Men's Judiciary Council, and the Bat-
talion Staff of the NROTC as Battalion
Quartermaster.
Next semester the Navy-Avill claim his
services and he hopes to see active duty
in the near future.
versatile
An outstanding senior engineer in
both scholastic and extracurricular
achievement is one Roy K. Bradley.
Most students know him as a member
of the Michigan hockey team, on which
he has played for the last two seasons.
He is a member of the M club, having
earned a letter in hockey in each of the
past two seasons. However hockey is
not the only sport at which Roy is
adept. Outside the hockey season he
plays on the tennis team. Last year he
was unable to find the time for tennis,
but this year he is continuing where he
left off in his sophomore year. It is quite

A New Fleet of Tugs is being built for
the U. S. Navy. Their principle duty is long
towing of disabled vessels in rough seas.
The most powerful of their kind in the
world, most of the tugs will be driven by
Allis-Chalmers electrical propulsion equip-

been published by Allis-Chalmers. It takes
a new slant at motor care and is of great
value to war plant engineers and mainte-
nance men, and particularly for training

lightning rods
Recent studies of lightning strokes
have shown that each square mile of
sky annually sends about ten strokes of
lightning earthward. This means that
in a modern powder plant, which con-
tains several hundred structures, each
building will become the target of a
bolt of lightning several times each
year. Only one spark is needed to cause
a disastrous explosion or fire. One can
readily see therefore that protection is
essential when it is known that one
lightning stroke can have a peak cur-
rent of 200,000 amperes or enough elec-
trical energy momentarily to supply a
city of 50,000 people. The voltage may
be enough to blow out 200,000,000
household fuses.
It has been found that by simply
raising a wire "umbrella" over a build-
ing sufficient protection will be obtained
from the most severe strokes and with
a minimum use of strategic war mater-
ials. This protection was developed pri-
marily for the purpose of protecting
structures housing explosives, oil, and
other highly inflammable products. The
"umbrella" consists of several steel wires
strung above a building, the number de-
pending upon the structure and its use.
The wires are anchored to wooden poles
and then led earthward to steel rods
buried in the ground.
The usual type of lightning rod, such
as would be used on an explosives plant,
requires the use of 250 pounds of cop-
per. According to tests, an "umbrella"
system, using only 60 pounds of steel
would provide the same protection. Such
a system could easily deflect a bolt ad-
vancing at the rate of 11,000,000 miles
a minute and would also prevent the
lightning from leaping to metal work
and causing a dangerous spark.
silicon plastics
A group of new plastics known as
silicones have been produced from the
combination of the organic chemicals
with an inorganic mineral. Chemically
the new materials result from combining
of silicon dioxide with the methyl or
ethyl groups of molecules. By using the
straight chain or the ring type organic
molecules, different properties can be
given to the resultant materials.

grand slam
Much has been said and written
about the heroism of our Marines at
Wake Island. Those boys did a won-
derful job and we at home will be
eternally indebted to them for keeping
the wily slant-eye at bay while our
pacifism could be whipped into bel-
ligerism.
One of the choice bits that eminated
from that theater of Hell concerned
four Marines who were enjoying a
friendly rubber of bridge between at-
tacks by Hirohito's little yellow stooges.
The boys were in a particularly tense
situation—a finesse was imminent which
meant the difference between a grand
slam and a month's pay—when sudden-
ly a fellow Leatherneck burst into the
room shouting that the Japs had landed
200 men on the beach. The boys looked
from one to the other until finally one
of them broke the ice. "I'll go," he said,
"I'm dummy."
The finesse, as always, didn't work.

If any of our readers happened to
come in contact with the last issue of
Garg, they probably noticed a terse bit
about the Technic requesting a feud
with them. This charge is not only
ridiculous, it's downright libelous.
This alleged feud started when the
Technic cited an incident in which a
Garg editor came in one day on a sup-
posed social visit and walked off with
several jokes which appeared in some
affiliated engineering magazines—jokes,
incidentally, which the Technic would-
n't even print. These were printed
under a guise of originality.
Consequently, since the Garg cannot
accept the Technic's chiding with the
spirit in which it is written, as of this
month it can expect no more free pub-
licity from us.

The Advanced Corps of the R.O.T.C.
has finally returned to A2 from the
battle of Camp Custer. Neutral sources
in Switzerland report that the corps gave
a good account of itself in this baptism
of fire. Neglecting the 28 cadets who
had to be shot because of distemper,
casualties were held to a minimum.
Highlight of the battle was a new
weapon used by the Custer medics—a
hypodermic needle with a motor driven
egg beater mounted on the business end.
When the armistice had been signed,
the army sergeants swore on their quar-
termaster manuals that all of the cap-
tured cadets who had been placed on
the K.P. chain gang would be released.
We are reticent to question the integ-
rity of army sergeants, but this morning

of potatoes from Camp Custer. A note
was inclosed . . . "Sherman was right.

ngineers who know their
bearings are helping to win the war

Timken Tapered Roller Bearings in untold millions have gone
and constantly are going into American fighting equipment and
the industrial machines that produce it—placed there by engineers
who know from years of experience what Timken Bearings can do.
Many of these veteran engineers began to acquire their knowl-
edge of Timken Bearings while in college, and if you asked
them they would tell you that this has been an important factor
in their success.
For there is no bearing problem, however complex, that cannot
be solved by the multiple abilities of Timken Bearings — the
total elimination of friction; the safe carrying of radial, thrust
and combined loads; and the holding of moving parts in correct
and constant alignment.
Begin now to obtain your knowledge of Timken Bearings.

acy in the integration, if warranted by
the accuracy of the other factors, may
be attained by breaking up the integral
unit from 2 to 4, dividing the interval
from 2 to 3 into two parts and that from
3 to 4 into four parts. Note that it is
not possible to divide only the interval
3 to 4 into four parts as then there
would not be a whole number of inte-
gral units. That is, from 3 to 4 would
be two integral units, 2 to 3 a unit and
0 would be the center of a unit. For
convenience in calculation instead of

9.32964 x 4 = 37.3186 sq. in.
Error = 1.01%
The greater errors found when the
rules are applied to the ellipse than
when applied to the sine curve are due
to the difference over an integral unit
between the curve under consideration
and that assumed in the derivation.
The examples show that the error can
be materially reduced by the introduc-
tion of subdivided intervals, and the
question arises as to when such sub-
divided intervals should be used. Fig-
ure 2b indicates that the greater part
of the error, using half and quarter in-
tervals as described, is in the portion
lying between Station 3 and 4. This
would indicate that errors may be ex-
pected when the curve is tangent to the
last ordinate.
It is frequently convenient to apply
polar integration to curves of the char-
acter of the ellipse as shown in Figure

to do, afterward?
A MESSAGE TO MEN ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES
At no time in all the years we have been
the confidant of young men approaching a
career have we been so sure of the oppor-
tunity implicit in your future.
Today, your campus may not be of your
own choosing. Your courses, your schedules
almost all are pointed toward immediate
necessity. Your career is set.
Have you a true conception of how much
your special training means to your coun-
try? To Victory?
We think you do. But, honestly, don't you
catch yourself wondering whether there is
really going to be something for you to do,
afterward? Are you sometimes in doubt of
what's to come after NOW?
We say to you: There is a world to be
made anew.
That world is going to offer you creative
opportunity surpassing anything we old-
timers have ever seen. You are going to
have tools and materials and knowledge to
work with such as no generation ever had.
We think you are going to find not only
a country, but a whole world, waiting for
your talents.
And we know that in this country you are
going to find a point-of-view throughout
industry which is a new thing under the sun.
Already countless leaders in industry are
laying plans which are based on flat accept-
ance of the principle that their first respon-
sibility, after all-out production for war, is
to make postwar jobs.
We at Alcoa are one group of such men.
We are Imagineering now, for you. We
intend to do everything we know how to
make aluminum make jobs, whether they
may be with us, or in a thousand other
industries which will be using Alcoa Alumi-
num when it is again available.
Wherever you are in service, you will
surely be in, or around, or supported by,
American airplanes. Will you remember
two things: They are made largely of
Alcoa Aluminum. And, the folks who make
that metal are even now Imagineering for
your future.

In this case the Trapezoidal Rule is
more accurate than Simpson's. Both,
however, are well within the limits of
accuracy of the other factors found in
most engineering calculations. The ten-

average about 99.5% accurate.

Before passing from the more com-
mon applications of the rule to the less
well-known, an illustration of its use in
finding the center of gravity of an area
will be given.
To find the x coordinate of the center
of gravity of one half the sine curve:
By calculus the x coordinate of the
curve from x = 0 to x = Y^\ is
1 10
3.1416
= 3.183'
In the use of Simpson's Rule to find
moments, the following reasoning is
adopted.
In Figure 3 let y be the ordinate at
any distance x from the OY axis. Then
dA = ydx and A = I ydx between
limits x = 0 and x = 4.
The moment dM or dA about the axis
OY is xydx and the total moment will be
M — I xydx between the limits x = 0
and x — 4. This is equivalent to finding
the area of a curve whose ordinates are
xy. Such a curve is shown by curve B.
(Continued from page 22)
As we want the area under the curve
as the divisor of the moment, the work
is performed as shown in the following
table since axbxc = axcxb.

Moments of inertia may also be cal-
culated following similar reasoning. In
general one may say that Simpson's
Rule may be applied if it is required to
perform the operation I f(y)dx, pro-
vided the numerical values of f (y) at an
even number of equal intervals of x (or
halves or quarters thereof) may be eval-
uated. Frequently it is not convenient
to obtain values of f(y) at equal inter-
vals of x. In this case the ordinates of
the curve at unequal intervals may be
plotted, equal intervals laid off and the
respective values read from the curve.
Simpson's Second Rule
Simpson's Second Rule is derived on
the assumption that the curve over three
intervals is a parabola of the third de-
gree.
Five, Eight, Minus One Rule
This rule will give the area between
any two of three equally spaced ordi-
nates. The curve is assumed to be the
same as for the first rule and its deriva-
tion is similar.
If the end ordinate is zero, the First,
Second, and 5, 8, -1, Rules may be used
to set up simultaneous equations to dif-
ferentiate a curve. (See Hok's Method
of Obtaining a Curve of Stability in
Attwood and Pengelly, Theoretical
Naval Architecture.)
Tchebycheg's Rule
This rule assumes the curve to be a
prabola whose degree is the same as the
number of stations. The positions of the
stations are so located that the area
equals their sum multiplied by the
length of the curve and devided by the
number of ordinates. As the spacing,
laid off from the middle of the length
of the curve, is unequal and varies with
the number of ordinates employed, it is
not generally as adaptable as Simpson's
First or Second Rules.
The above give a brief outline of the
more common rules for integration in
general use. Facility in their use as well
as a proper conception of their limita-
tions is best obtained by applying them
to additional mathematical curves as
has been done in the examples.

probable that you'll find his name
among the top four on the tennis team
this year.
Roy had quite a time trying to decide
where to go to school. Two weeks be-
fore the Michigan fall semester opened
Roy was planning to go to Michigan
State, but just about that time he was
offered a scholarship to Michigan. After
some deliberation he decided to accept
the scholarship and like all true Michi-
gan men is very glad he chose the school
he did.
He had planned to go to Michigan
State with a friend who was his doubles
partner in tennis back in Mackenzie
High School in Detroit. This fellow has
now become captain of the Michigan
State tennis team, so when Michigan
meets State in tennis this spring be pre-
pared to watch the fur fly.
Roy is as much a student as he is an
athlete and has proven himself worthy
of the scholarship by being elected to
membership in Triangles, Vulcans, and
Tau Beta Pi.
Roy is a senior in Aeronautical Engi-
neering and expects to graduate this
May. If he can obtain the consent of
his draft board, after graduation he
hopes to work in the new aeronautical
research department of the Dow Chemi-
cal Co.
absent minded prof.
Absent-mindedness seems to be a
characteristic of some college professors.
Such is the case with Professor Arnold
M. Kuethe, acting chairman of the Aero
Department. But although he occasion-
ally forgets such trivial things as ap-
pointments and classes, he is well known
for his slow and deliberate thorough-
ness.
Born at Marsh Field, Wisconsin on
August 24, 190S, Prof. Kuethe started
adding letters to his name in 1926 with
a Ph.B. in Physics and Mathematics
from Ripon College, Ripon, Wisconsin.
From 1927 to 1930 he was Junior Phy-
sicist at the National Bureau of Stand-
ards in Washington, D.C. In search of
more letters he picked up a Ph.D. in
Aeronautical Engineering from The Cali-
fornia Institute of Technology in 1933.
He then did research work in aerody-
namics and meteorology for the Guggen-
'heim Airship Institute at Akron, Ohio.
While he was Associate Editor of the
Journal of Aeronautical Sciences from
1938 to 1940, he lectured at New York
University and did consulting work in
aeronautics. In 1940 he went to the
laboratories of the National Advisory

Committee of Aeronautics at Langley
Field to do research work in aerodyna-
mics. He came to Michigan in Sept.
1941 as Associate Professor and is now-
acting chairman of the Aeronautical En-
gineering Department.
Among his many memberships are:
Chairman of the Detroit Section of the
Institute of Aeronautical Science, So-
ciety for the Promotion of Engineering
Education, Sigma Psi, University Club,
and The Junior Research Club.
Before the war Professor Kuethe "s
spare time was taken up with golf and
fishing. What little time he now has
is devoted to the reading of current
magazines.

Although these are the largest groups

In addition, there are several small
units of Army officers receiving special-
ized training in the Medical School, and
the College of Engineering is providing
technical instruction for large numbers
of civilian government personnel, par-
ticularly Ordnance Department em-
ployees.
The University has the responsibility
of providing the specialized instruction
for all of the Army units excepting one.
and also has the task of housing and
feeding the men. The Judge Advocate
General's School is the only Army unit
which provides its own faculty.
Colonel William A. Ganoe is the Com-

Being organic materials most plastics
have had the properties of wood, rub-
ber, or textile fibers and have lacked
the heat resistance or hardness found
in inorganic materials, such as glass.
The introduction of silicon results in a
plastic that will do many things others
could not.
As a solid, its melting point is close
to five-hundred degrees Fahrenheit, far
above that of other plastics. This means
it can be used on electrical connections
where extreme heat may develop. As a
liquid, such as oil, the new plastic does
not become thick as temperatures fall,
nor thin when temperatures soar. For
this reason it would be of great use in
fighting planes.
Another new substance developed
along with the silicones is a plastic re-
markably tough and resistant to chemi-
cals. This plastic, chemically known as
vinylidene chloride and called Saran, is
made from ethylene, derived from pe-
troleum; and chlorine, derived from salt
brine. It is now going chiefly into in-
dustrial and war use. It makes piping
for industrial apparatus and can be
welded and threaded with ordinary
plumbing tools. In the tropics where
metals have relatively short lives, Saran
filaments are woven into mosquito
screens. Strands of Saran woven into
rope resist acid and salt water. A rope
of Saran one-quarter inch thick is as
strong as a three-quarter inch hemp
rope.
factory roofs
A radical departure in factory con-
struction is proposed in a recent archi-
tectural journal. The building is start-
ed with a one-piece insulated steel mem-
brane serving as the roof and lying flat
on the ground. It is then raised by
air pressure from ordinary ventilating
blowers and supported from then on by
a positive pressure of 1 p.s.i. The
steel roof is anchored to concrete along
the perimeter of the building and upon
raising is stretched into a dome-shaped
structure. The increased pressure has
a negligible physical effect on the per-
sonnel, being less than the difference in
air pressure at the top and bottom of
a sixty story building.
Some of the advantages to be attained
with this design are the freedom of
working space and saving in construc-
tional steel. Only one tenth of the
amount of metal used in ordinary con-
struction is needed.
The factory is well protected against
air leakage as all doors are made dou-
ble, forming air locks, except for the
revolving doors for personnel and the
door for a railroad siding. In the last
case, the bulk of the space is filled by
the car and the air loss is small. Leak-
age is so slight that the fans could be
stopped for several days without ap-
preciable setting of the roof and in the
case of longer shut down periods, a
single small fan will support the roof
indefinitely.
The roof is composed of 90 inch
strips welded electrically to each other
and seam welded to the concrete anchor
ring. Upon erection it is stretched
about 1% which is well within the 20%
range of the 18 gauge, 3/64th in. thick
steel used.

The Goblin that
works for America
The inquisitive alchemists of the Middle Ages
were looking for silver. Repeatedly, they smelted
certain ores and got a silvery-looking metal. But it
was only silvery4ooking. It never turned out to be
silver. So the alchemists thought that a malicious
spirit was thwarting them, and they called the
strange metal Kobold, meaning goblin.
Today that same goblin, known in America as
cobalt, has become one of this country's great fight-
ing elements. Cobalt is alloyed with chromium and
tungsten to make "Haynes Stellite" alloys which have
the property of "red hardness." Metal-cutting tools
made of these alloys keep on cutting even when red
hot! Cobalt improves red hardness and toughness
in other kinds of metal-cutting tools. Thus, cobalt
has contributed greatly to the tremendous output
of planes, tanks, guns, and other war materials.
Cobalt is also used to produce improved magnet
steels. Permanent magnets of cobalt-tungsten steel
are more powerful, and last longer. Permanent mag-
nets are necessary in much electrical equipment.
This country's cobalt formerly came from Bel-
gium, where it was refined from African ores found
in the Belgian Congo.
As war clouds loomed, and as accelerated Ameri-
can industry made rapid inroads on the stockpiles
shipped out of Belgium during 1938 and 1939, ELEC-
TRO Metallurgical Company, a unit of UCC,
designed and built facilities in this country for the
Belgians. ELECTROMET now operates these facilities
so that Haynes Stellite Company, another Unit
of UCC, and other American companies can have
the cobalt they need for essential war work. Opera-
tions began in 1941. Today, these facilities annually
produce more cobalt than was ever imported in any
year previously.

plasticizer is added, there is no material
to be removed on exposure and conse-
quently the material exhibits excellent
dimensional stability.
The applications of polystyrene are
numerous and diversified because of the
wide range of physical properties that
are possible to obtain in its production.
In the chemical industry great improve-
ment has been made in the packaging
of mineral acids in molded poylstyrene
which may be used because of its re-
sistance to high acid concentration.
Different colors identify the acids, and
the elimination of contamination is
aided. Another improvement is the acid
bottle adapter, designed to fit the new
screw-type bottle in which the acid is
joined to an automatic burette. This
aids in the preparation of solutions and
eliminates possible acid burns from spill-
ing.
Polystyrene has equally good resist-
ance to alkalis and hydrofluoric acid.
Both attack glass, but do not affect
polystyrene; hence, containers of poly-
styrene solve the problem of keeping
acids and alkalis in the pure form,
thereby promoting more accurate ana-
lytical work.
Polystyrene is sufficiently soluble in
coal-tar hydrocarbons, chlorinated hy-
drocarbons, and acetic esters of lower
aliphatic alcohols to make it of interest
as a lacquer and coating modifying
agent.
The water resistance of polystyrene is
very good, and its water absorption is
detectable only by the most sensitive
equipment. This factor, plus its ability
to remain plastic and retain its strength
at temperatures as low as minus thirty
degrees Centigrade, has led to the ex-
tended use of polystyrene in the field of
refrigeration.
The high index of refraction of poly-
styrene makes possible the reproduction
of all colors, pastel shades, and degrees
of transparency. The colors are non-
bleeding regardless of humidity or tem-
perature; hence colored polystyrene
achieves both decorative and utilitarian
purposes. The packaging of cosmetics
has received added impetus since the
advent of plastics.
Since polystyrene is not affected by
alcohol, and has no offensive odor or
taste, it is used widely for liquor dis-
pensation. It improves both the ap-
pearance and identification of packag-
ing.
Its high modulus of elasticity results
in rigid moldings. The high heat dis-
tortion point of polystyrene makes it
highly suitable for close tolerances at
elevated temperatures or for long peri-
ods of time at normal temperatures.
Polystyrene is used extensively on the
instrument panels of airplanes. One of
its unique properties is that it is capable
of transmitting and carrying light
through curved sections. This charac-
teristic is employed in the illumination
of aircraft instruments. By using poly-
styrene another problem was solved, as
the material also had to be capable of
withstanding tropical temperatures
without distortion. This was accom-
plished by the use of a split ring to
carry the light and transmit it through
an annular ring, called the window.
Such a design provides adequate illumi-
nation of the instrument without blind-
ing the pilot during night flying. With
these abilities, the material is also highly
suitable for use in illuminating signs,
and in any variable temperature appli-
cation desiring practical yet highly dec-
orative design.
Its excellent dielectric qualities and
low power-factor have gained for poly-
styrene an important outlet in the field
of radio and television. It is used in
coil forms, lead bushings, tube bases
and other parts where the ultimate in
low-loss efficiency is necessary.
One of the newest developments in
the radio and television field is the use
of polystyrene film in wound condensers
of low capacitance. This film, one mil
in thickness, is wound between the me-
tallic foils, and thus provides insula-
tion of a dielectric strength of over
three thousand volts.
One of the most recent, and perhaps
one of the most important applications
of styrene is its contribution to the pro-
duction of synthetic rubber as a co-
polymer of butadiene, the basic material
in synthetic rubber. Monomer purity,
high in styrene, is perhaps the most im-
portant single consideration in the prep-
aration of the styrene-budtadiene co-
polymer. In the manufacture of Buna
S rubber styrene has become indispens-
able, and may in the near future figure
highly in the military campaigns and
their ultimate success.

date.
PROBLEM
Mr. John Hansen, civil engineer for
Roswell county, receives his fees for the
design and supervision of engineering
structures in that country. Mr. Han-
sen's designs and plans must have the
final approval of a commission to which
he reports.
A bridge for a railway crossing in
the county is to be built. After a care-
ful study Mr. Hansen prepares a suit-
able design for the bridge. Another en-
gineer, Mr. William Brown, prepares a
new and very efficient design which saves
steel. Mr. Brown suggests to Mr. Han-
sen that he should use this new design
for the county bridge due to the scarcity
of steel.
Among the three usual bidders for
Roswell county contracts is the Ameri-
can Construction Company, whose offi-
cials learn of the above situation and
offer to remunerate Mr. Brown directly
in case they receive the contract. There-
upon Mr. Brown suggests that Mr. Han-
sen submit the new design and recom-
mend the American Construction Com-
pany for the job. In this way he can
still get his design fee from the county
since the company is willing to pay Mr.
Brown's fee and this procedure will save
much needed steel.
What should Mr. Hansen do and
what should he report to the commis-
sion?

AMERICAN OPTIMISM
The American people as a whole are
an extremely optimistic lot—they al-
ways have been. No one worries much
if things go wrong for a time; they're
bound to take a turn for the better.
They accept life's set-backs and hard-
ships always knowing that they can't
continue forever.
Beneficial as this optimistic outlook
may be, in time of war it often does
more harm than good, especially if ac-
companied by the disinterested attitude
that is evident at the present time.
A brief consideration of the respec-
tive Allied and Axis successes serve to
illustrate that this over-confidence is
entirely uncalled for, and unless checked
is apt to act as an effective Axis weapon
to undermine our war materials output
and, consequently, our actual striking
power. Hitler still dominates the major
part of Europe; the Germans have not
yet been driven out of Africa; a large
and important part of Russia is still
under German subjugation; the Japan-
ese have successfully established them-
selves in the mid-Pacific; and the Kiska
stepping-stone is still in Japanese hands.
True, these far-flung battlefronts are
being regained, but the process is slow
and the job is far from done. The Al-
lies only recently have assumed the of-
fensive, and in many sectors are still
fighting defensive battles.
Why, then, the undue optimism?
Much of the blame for this condition
can be laid to our own propaganda ma-
chine. Newspaper headlines carry word
of Allied victories, but Allied losses are
minimized; newscasters give lengthy
descriptions of American successes, but
only sketchily tell of set-backs. A neu-
tral observer would be led to believe
that the American public cannot be
trusted with the truth; that Americans
are allergic to bad news. That the Uni-
ted Nations are far from complete vic-
tory should be made evident to every-
one, but apparently our governmental
agencies would have us believe that it
will only be a matter of months before
we will again be back to normal.
The United States is somewhat iso-
lated from the actual conflict while other
nations have been a part of, or have
been directly affected by it. To the peo-
ple of these other countries the war is
a terrible, deadly thing; to Americans
it is almost unreal and the happenings
in war-torn countries seem remote from
their daily lives. This is probably the
major reason for the prevalent disinter-
ested attitude among the general pub-
lic. Workers spend longer and harder
hours at their machines, but also de-
mand higher wages; rationing is ac-
cepted, but not as cheerfully as the gov-
ernment would have us believe; practi-
cally everybody invests in bonds with
10/£ of his pay, but few exceed this set
quota, and many turn them in for cash
at the first opportunity: labor bosses
have signified their patriotic intentions,
but do not hesitate to authorize strikes
if personal gain is involved.
Americans ordinarily have a right to
be optimistic. Why shouldn't they?
They admittedly live in the finest coun-
try in the world. But this is war—war
for survival—and although history books
say we have never been on the losing
end when the chips were down, there's
always a first time.

The problem of drilling a number of holes in a part on
precise center distances is seldom simple. It is par-
ticularly complicated in mass production of parts
where holes must register accurately.
The answer in one plant is what is known as a
transfer plate. This is really a circular template, of
any thickness over Ve inch, with uniform holes drilled
on accurate centers. These holes fit a pin located at
the exact center of a lathe face plate.
In mounting, the work is assembled to the transfer
plate with a spacer between. The assembly is pinned
to the face plate through one of the holes in the trans-
fer plate, and clamped tight.
A boring bar in the lathe tool rest can be used to
bore a hole of any desired size in the work. The hole
will be exactly in line with the pin, and consequently
with the hole in the transfer plate.
Subsequent holes are bored by passing the pin
through the remaining holes in the plate, until all are
bored. When finished, every hole, regardless of dia-
meter should be on the same center as the corre-
sponding hole in the plate.

. . . Army helmets are being turned out
much faster today than they were a year
ago. Time is saved in the drying process.
Instead of using an oven which takes
about 15 minutes for drying, an infra-
red dryer is used which does the job in
one minute and 35 seconds. The length
of the old oven type dryer is 225 feet,
while the infrared dryer is only 19 feet
long. Thus, not only is time saved but
also valuable floor space. In one hour
500 helmets can be turned out.
... Mirrors are helping steel plants
speed production to war-time levels by
measuring the width of steel plate that
is passed between rollers. The system
consists of mirrors, a pane of glass, and
lights. One set of mirrors catches the
image and another set is aimed at a pane
of glass with spaced lines. Both of these
images are superimposed on a third mir-
ror which shows whether the plate is the
proper size.
... It is now possible to successfully
weld magnesium alloys. The process
used does not require a flux, but while
welding, a shield of helium gas covers
the metal preventing oxidation. The arc
is produced between a tungsten electrode
and the base metal while helium is fed
through a specially designed torch.
. .. The shipbuilding industry was the
best customer for steel in 1942. 9,425,000
tons of steel was used for all types
of ships ranging from small landing
barges to mighty battleships. This figure
was almost three and one-half times
higher than that of 1941. Of the total
steel produced in 1942, 16 per cent went
to the shipyards.
... Ten days were saved when a 13 inch
turbine shaft was machined without re-
moving it from its bearings. Sandy water
had entered the bearings scorching the
shaft and causing the turbine to become
unbalanced. A makeshift lathe was

rigged up and as the turbine turned
slowly, the shaft was machined. This
took 12 hours. Had the 4,753 H.P.
turbine been dismantled and sent to a
machine shop, the cost including loss
due inactivity would have been about
$6,000. Using the built up lathe, the
cost was reduced to $1,500.
... Surface cracks can be detected by
using an ultra violet light and a fluo-
rescent solution. The solution is allowed
to flow over the material to be examined
and then wiped off. If any surface
cracks exist, they will show up under
ultra violet light. Ultra violet can also
be used to detect oil on a surface before
a plating operation.
... It has been found that 3-30 per cent
rosin in soap gives certain desirable
properties without ruining any inherent
characteristics. First, it improves water
solubility and sudsing. Next, it helps
prevent dusting of flake or other forms
of dry soap. Lastly, detergency is im-
proved. So in the future don't be sur-
prised to see soap manufacturers adver-
tise their products as '24% rosin con-
tent.'
... Wood has three enemies: fire, decay
and termites. By using lumber dipped in
creosote, it was possible to construct a
dock that would not decay or be attacked
by marine borers. Yet, these creosote
dipped logs are not fire proof. The
method used to incorporate resistance to
these three agents is a chemical pressure
process. This new process is apt to in-
crease the competition between the steel
and lumber industries after the war.
Unlike creosote treated lumber, this 'all
three' type will take paint.
... Special shelters designed for Arctic
use are now being built on a large scale.
They are 16 feet wide, 16 feet long and
8^2 feet high in the center. They look
like half-cylinders with a door and some
windows. The entire shelter is thorough-
ly insulated to keep the fuel consump-
tion at a minimum. The weight of the
shelter is only 1200 pounds and the
volume when crated is 160 cubic feet.
Other outstanding features are that the
shelter is waterproof, fireproof, and
vermin proof.
... In foundry work, costly patterns and
core boxes have had to be thrown away
because of excessive wear. Now, new
patterns are sprayed with a low melting
point alloy. If the wood is hard, a coat
of shellac must be applied and the metal
sprayed on while the shellac is still
tacky. The thickness of the metal coat-
ing varies from about .002 to .005 inch.

Ever wonder where our anti-tank
weapons get their wallop? Part of
the answer is in the way the
armor-piercing projectile is made.
Hardened at the point, it is made
softer toward the base to prevent
shattering on impact. Proper range
of hardness is insured by testing
a section sliced length-wise from
the center of a sample projectile.
But how do you cut steel tough
enough to pierce a tank? With a
cutting off wheel such as made
by Carborundum!
Cutting off wheels are abrasive
discs that are amazingly tough
and often extremely thin. They
do the work in a fraction of the
time required by ordinary meth-
ods. Their high precision adapts
them to the most delicate oper-
ations such as slotting pen
points. Such wheels are now used
to cut plastics, glass, brick,
tile, steel and non-ferrous
metals in plate and bar stock.
Frequently further finishing
is unnecessary.

War brings about many changes. Be
cause of the shortage of steel, the Na-
tional Archives is cutting paper file
boxes at a very much lower rate than
they paid for steel filing boxes. They
have found that the paper filing boxes
wear well and since they do not handle
these boxes too often, they believe after
the war is over that they shall continue
to use card board boxes.
These filing boxes are kept in the Na-
tional Archives building which is consid-
ered the most nearly bombproof build-
ing in Washington.
People often picture North Africa as
another desert. They sometimes remark
that it isn't worth fighting for. If Ger-
many loses North Africa, she will have
to find another source of phosphate ore
which is a necessity, not only as a ferti-
lizer but also as an ingredient in ferro-
phosphorous and various other chemi-
cals. The phosphate ore in North Africa
is exceptionally high grade, 58% of the
ore being phosphate. Germany's other
sources are either France or Spain. So it
seems logical to say that North Africa is
worth fighting for if only from a mineral
standpoint.
Salvaging scrap is one thing, but turn-
ing the scrap metal into useful metal in
the shape of bars and plates is another.
Unless the exact composition of the
scrap is known, it is very difficult to pro-
duce a steel that will correspond to the
S.A.E. specifications. The only cure for
this ill is to keep all scrap alloy steels
segregated.
The demand for beryllium copper al-
loys is 40% above the supply. The chief
use of beryllium is for beryllium-copper
alloys. This alloy is adapted to electrical
work where a strong heat treated metal
is needed. This superior beryllium-cop-
per base alloy has shown marked charac-
teristics. Some of them are a high tensile
strength, high fatigue strength and elas-
tic limit, also good electrical conductiv-
ity, excellent corrosion resistance, and
good wear resistance.
Current production is about 3,000,000
pounds a year. It is expected that with
expansion of present facilities, the yearly
production will be increased to 10,-
000,000 pounds.
Seven years of constant operation with
only minor mechanical repairs is a record
performance held by a Midwest steel
furnace before it was blown out. In that

period, 3,000,000 tons of steel were pro-
duced by this one furnace.
The welding engineer is asking for a
lower factor of safety with consequent
reduction of weight in steel ships. This
statement seems to be rather bold espec-
ially since the failure of the tanker
"Schenectady" due to an improper weld.
However, tests have shown that a section
of a welded ship can be bent 180 degrees
without failure while a riveted joint need
be bent only a few degrees to have a
complete failure.
War is responsible for a few good
things and very many bad ones. Perhaps
the most outstanding evil is the loss of
young men who are in their prime. Most
American pople look forward to a peace-
ful day when we can again resume our
peacetime work. Industry is already
looking in that direction and that brings
up the subject of aluminum castings. It
is possible to use secondary aluminum as
this makes the castings much cheapr.
The characteristics of secondary alum-
inum are about the same as virgin metal
except for the elongation which is su-
perior in virgin aluminum. The demand
for light weight castings will undoubt-
edly increase.
... The railroads of America see an in-
evitable tie shortage for 1944. Ties last
according to the traffic that passes over
them. Since there has been an increase
of 72 per cent ton miles and also 129
per cent in passenger miles during 1942
as compared with the normal times of
1940, cross ties will not last as long.
In 1940, the large railroads used 41,-
000,000 crossties as compared with 57.-
500,000 crossties used in 1942.
The present supply is expected to last
this year. However, in the beginning of
this year, the railroads had an 8 months
supply on hand, the lowest in 13 years.
This shortage is explained not by one
reason but by many. The reasons are
popping up in eveery industry and they
are labor shortages; lack of sawmill and
logging equipment; shortages of auto-
motive equipment such as trucks, tires,
repair parts, and gasoline; also the in-
creased demand on the number industry
for wood products. This problem of
crossties will have to be met by the rail-
roads immediately if they are to operate
at the present rate in 1944.

planes. In a submarine, it is necessary
to have a luminescent dial should the
power fail: while in a night bomber,
only a fluorescent dial board activated
by ultra violet can be used if good re-
sults are desirable.
In dock areas where lights must be
extinguished, the ends of piers are
marked with luminescent material. Also
marked are fire extinguishers, first aid
equipment, and other essential equip-
ment which is needed in an emergency.
... Increased industrial activity has also
increased accidents which often result in
serious injury or even death. The fol-
lowing incidents will give a few of the
more serious accidents.
One woman who was working in a war
plant, stooped to pick up a fallen object.
As she stooped, her apron caught on a
slowly turning shaft. Instead of trying
to let the apron be pulled off her by
breaking the strings, she tried to pull it
off with her hands. While doing this,
she got her arm tangled in the folds of
her apron and before the machine could
be stopped, her arm was broken in 14
points. It took three years before she
could use her arm again. The safety
point to keep in mind is, above all, use
your head. It is far better to lose some
clothing than a member of your body.
... A new electronic crest voltmeter has
been designed to measure ignition vol-
tages of internal combustion engines;
surge voltages caused by corona and sur-
face discharges in the insulation on such
electric equipment as motors, generators,
and cables; and other repeated-impulse
voltages up to 30,000 volts. The instru-
ment weighs only 23 pounds and fills the
need for a portable crest voltmeter for
both laboratory and production testing.
It is suitable for field measurement, such
as trouble shooting and the determina-
tion of actual operating conditions, and
can also be used for testing aircraft en-
gines in flight.
The crest voltmeter can be used in
areas where no electric power is avail-
able, since it has a self-contained bat-
tery power supply. It can be moved
readily to any location for testing pur-
poses—a valuable feature when the
equipment to be tested is too large to be
moved conveniently.
... Iron from a lake bed. Fantastic, but
its true. A very large iron deposit of
badly needed high grade ore has been
discovereed on the bottom of a lake in
Canada. The ore analyzes as 62.171 per
cent iron. Before mining operations can
be started, a river must be dug, leading
away from the lake, and then the lake
must be drained. The lake holds 120
billion gallons of water, but engineers
say they can start mining operations
after the water level has been lowered
two-thirds. It has been estimated that
the time required to drain the lake suf-
ficiently will be 20 months. This source
will have a distinct effect in supple-
menting our iron supply.
... A new vertical-type liquid-level
transmitter has been developed for meas-
uring the fuel level in the tanks of heavy
bombers. The transmitter is operated
by a laminated-cork float, traveling on a
square shaft inside the vertical tube. As
the liquid level changes, the float is ro-
tated by a spiral guide, cut in the verti-
cal tube, and thus turns the square shaft.
The position of this shaft is indicated
remotely by the d-c selsyn system, at
the indicator on the instrument panel.
The entire weight of the moving ele-
ment is suspended from the top bearing,
the bottom bearing serving only as a
giude. A magnetic coupling is used be-
tween the transmitter outside the tank
and the float mechanism inside the tank
so as to provide a positive gasoline seal.

HARLOWO. WHITTEMORE, MLD,
Professor of Landscape Architecture
/CAMOUFLAGE, or protective con-
^-&gt;* cealment may be defined as the
science of disguising or hiding a target
from an enemy, including any and every
method of confusing and misleading him
as to its location, strength and purpose.''
Thus, Major Robert P. Breckenridge of
the Corps of Engineers, who is head of
the camouflage section, defines one of
the most fascinating aspects of military
operations and national defense.
The readers of the Technic will have
noticed numerous articles on camouflage
not only in technical military and naval
magazines but also in building and land-
scape architectural, art and engineering
magazines and frequently in the popular
illustrated weeklies. The cartoonists
have had a field day with the subject.
It is one that appeals to the North
American who loves to put something
over on the other fellow whether in a
horse trade, poker or football. In this
case, however, he may be saving his own
life and the lives of hundreds of his
fellow soldiers or workers, together with
highly essential military and naval equip-
ment and supplies and war production
facilities.
Clever military commanders have used
camouflage in one form or another ever
since the Thebans defeated the Spartans
in Ancient Greece with a kicked-up dust
cloud; Troy was conquered by soldiers
packed in a wooden horse; "Burnham
wood came to Dunsinane"; Genghis
Khan conquered almost all of Asia by
his uncanny ability to conceal his horse-
men in the natural terrain, and the
American Indians taught the American
colonist the art of personal concealment.
The Germans initiated modern camou-
flage in 1911 in preparation for their
first attempt at world conquest in 1914.
They produced some gigantic examples
of the successful concealment of whole
divisions and of troop movements and
supply, being thereby able to effect in
one case, in 1918, a surprise attack that
almost won the war.
The Allies retaliated with ideas of
their own, largely applied to guns and
ships and observation posts.
The further development of the ob-
servation airplane and aerial photogra-
phy, followed by accurate aerial bomb-
ing and machine gunnery, has greatly
emphasized the importance of protective
concealment and in addition forced radi-
cal changes in methods of procedure.
For example, even the complete conceal-
ment of an airplane factory will no
longer suffice to save it. Aerial photo-
graphs show the factory as occupying
a definite position with reference to the
surrounding landscape and the bom-
bardier merely has to put his bombs
down where the position is indicated on
the photograph in order to put the works
out of production. Thus the problem of
a fixed plant, aerial photographs of
which the enemy has had time to collect
either by observation mission or through
his consular agencies before the war, is
one of camouflaging or altering the
geography of the surrounding landscape
as well as the factory itself. Roads and
railways must be moved or covered and
dummy lines laid out. Rivers, small
ponds, and harbors must be changed or
covered; residential districts altered:
etc. The erection of a complete dummy
factory a half mile or more away may
be necessary to draw the attack. Rigid
discipline, covering all outdoor activities,
train and truck movements, fires and
smoke and artificial night illumination,
must be maintained and all evidences of
movement swept clean or retextured fre-
quently. The concealment of the plant
itself may be effectuated by painting
and texturing on the roof and surround-
ing grounds, by large tree plantings to
absorb tell-tale shadows and better still
by erecting wire netting completely over
the buildings, yards, and parking area
and these nets garnished to simulate the
continuation of the surrounding land-
scape over the factory. This garnishing
can be done to represent trees, shrubs,
fields, orchards, pastures, especially so
if real trees are present to assist in the
illusion. Natural woods, whole farm-
steads or residential districts are simu-
lated on the roofs of factories or as the

Graduate Research Assistant,

DURING the semesters that I have
worked on the cyclotron, I have
demonstrated it to perhaps one person
per day. These demonstrations have
indicated to me what questions the ma-
jority of people will ask. The answers,
which range from fundamental working
principles to somewhat advanced prob-
lems, will constitute this article. It is
my special aim to satisfy the interests
of the technical student, and toward this
purpose some detail is included.
The beam produced by the cyclotron
consists of ten million volt heavy hy-
drogen ions. The problem to be solved
by any high voltage accelerator in pro-
ducing such a beam is to guide charged
particles through an electric field of tre-
mendous potential. Solutions of this
problem have resulted in the different
types of linear accelerators, the cyclo-
tron, and the more recent betatron. The
ingenious feature of the cyclotron is that
it produces a total potential ranging in
the tens of millions of volts while oper-
ating at only a small fraction of the final
voltage.
If reference is made to the diagrams
the construction of the cyclotron may be
followed graphically. The housing is a cy-
lindrical tank of relatively large radius.
It is vacuum sealed and maintained at a
pressure of approximately one micron of
mercury. At this pressure collisions of
the beam with gas molecules are re-
duced to insignificance. Moreover, the
gas, if present, would conduct between
the high voltage gap and destroy the
charge.
The particles which are to constitute
the beam are heavy hydroden (deuter-
ium) nuclei. Heavy hydrogen is chemi-
cally the same as ordinary hydrogen.
The difference lies in the nucleus where
a neutron is present in addition to a pro-
ton—making deuterium a heavy isotope
of hydrogen. Deuterium gas is intro-
duced into the tank at a pressure only
slightly higher than the zero pressure.
This beam constituent, when ionized, is
to be accelerated.
Suspended in the tank are two copper
"dees." Together they would form a
flat, hollow cylinder. However, they are
separated along a diameter by a spacing
of about one inch. The dees, insulated
from the tank and from one another,
have impressed upon them a high fre-
quency alternating voltage. The fre-
quency is of the order of ten megacycles.
The voltage, which may be as low as 17,-
000 volts, will be as high as 1,000,000
volts in the supercyclotron being built
at Berkeley, California. Thus with al-
ternation, one dee is charged positively
and the other negatively; an electric
field is created in the gap between the
dees, and in falling through this field
the particles receive their energy.
An electrically heated filament is lo-
cated at the center of the base of the
tank for the purpose of ionizing the
neighboring deuterium. The filament it-
self is placed at a high negative voltage
so that the thermal electrons emitted are
repelled toward the center of the tank
with at least the ionization potential of
the deuterium. The atoms thus ionized
possess a unit positive charge. The elec-
trons (and their companions with which
they collided) are caught by a positive
plate toward which they were already
speeding and are carried away.
The reader has already seen an ex-
ample of electric charges—like charges
repelling, and unlike attracting. Just
Oenecro*
such forces are now in operation on the
charged deuterium. The nuclei are re-
pelled by the dee which is momentarily
positive and attracted by the one which
is negative. In falling through this elec-
tric field the nuclei receive their initial
energy (equal to the voltage across the
gap)-
Now they are to be brought around to
fall through the gap again. For this pur-
pose a magnetic field is created by pow-
erful electromagnets. The tank itself is
situated between the gap of the magnet
poles. The direction of the field is per-
pendicular to the base of the tank, and
therefore perpendicular to the path of
the beam.
Now any charged particles moving, as
our nuclei are, perpendicular to a mag-
netic field are acted upon by a force
which is perpendicular both to their ve-
locity and to the lines of force of the
field. This force changes the linear path
of the particle to a circular one—thus
the spiral path seen in the diagram. It
is just such a force which is utilized in
electric motors: electrons conducted
along armature coils are moving perpen-
dicular to a magnetic field, and the arm-
ature is forced to turn. The only differ-
ence lies in the fact that the electrons
are moving in wires, whereas our par-
ticles are suspended in free space.

hollow conductor such as the dee, and so
the charged particles now move only un-
der the influence of the magnetic field.
Their circular path heads them straight
for the dee-gap again. The timing is so
adjusted that as the particle reaches the
gap the formerly positive dee is negative
and the formerly negative dee is positive,
due to the alternation of the votlage.
Here the particles receive another
'kick", their second increment of en-
ergy.

In the simplicity with which the tim-
ing problem may be solved lies the real
success of the cyclotron. The funda-
mental equation for the motion of the
particles is
Hev = mv:/ r
where H is magnetic field strength,
e is charge on the particles,
v is velocity of particles,
m is mass of particles,
r is radius of path,
The second term of the equation is seen
to be the centrifugal force of the par-
ticles. Hev is the opposing centripital
force. Solving the equation for the ra-
dius, we find r equals 5—. The time re-
He
quired for the particle to traverse one
half circle is the distance divided by the
velocity or T equals wr/v. This in turn
mv 7T m
equals"' He or simply"h^ The period
v
is therefore a constant to the extent that
the last term is constant, and is indepen-
dent of velocity or radius. Therefore,
the voltage oscillator may be adjusted
to a single proper frequency, and all the
particles, whether just starting or at a
great radius, will cross the gap at the
correct time. When the timing is so ad-
justed the apparatus is said to be in reso-
nance; thus the term "magnetic reso-
nance accelerator," which is sometimes
applied. In practice the oscillator is ad-
justed to about the desired frequency
and the magnetic field is varied to cor-
respond.
By Newton's second law, force equals
mass times acceleration. The amount of
acceleration derived from a given force is
no function of velocity. Therefore the
particles can always receive additional
acceleration equal to that initially im-
parted only by falling through the gap
again. Every kick accelerates the par-
ticles and their velocity soon becomes
tremendous. If the dee voltage is 20,-
000 and if the particles fall through the
gap 500 times, as is the case in the Uni-
versity of Michigan cyclotron, the par-
ticles acquire 10,000,000 volts of energy.
From the formula for the radius, it is
seen to increase with velocity. The spiral
path of the particles becomes wider un-
til they reach the inner radius of the
dees. At this point they are ready to be
deviated from their path and thrown
toward a target. This is accomplished
by a deflector plate (see figure 1) ex-
tended outside this radius immediately
before the target. It is negatively
charged at about 20,000 volts potential
pending on its position. Particles reach-
ing the critical radius fall under the in-
fluence of this attracting field and are
deviated from their path. The target to
be bombarded is placed in line with their
new path.
We have followed a complete cycle of
the events in the cyclotron and have
thus explained its fundamental prin-
ciples. However, we have postponed
some important problems which any sin-
cere treatment of the subject should con-
tain.
The forces which operated on the par-
ticles in the horizontal plane in which
they move are clear. But what forces
guarantee that the particles will remain
in that plane? After all, they had a ran-
dom motion to start with. Moreover,
the groups consist of positively charged
particles all of which repel one another,
a tendency toward dispersion. The first
force effective in maintaining the hori-
zontal position is that of the electric
field itself. The shape of the lines of
force are shown in Figure 2. The par-
ticles in following these lines through the
first half of the gap are drawn toward
the center. However, in following the
lines through the last half of the gap
they are pulled away from the center—
an adverse effect. Nevertheless, if it is
remembered that the particles are accel-
erated across the gap, it will be seen that
they spend less time traversing the lat-
ter half than the first half. They are
therefore under the influence of the con-
verging force longer than under the di-
verging force, and the effect is a focus-
ing one.
As the particles go faster, this effect
becomes less significant, because the per-

By
J. ROBERT KELSO, '45E
THE recently constructed highway to
Alaska is one of the most amazing
feats of engineering to come out of this
war. Completed in less than a year
under some of the most adverse weather
conditions imaginable, it is truly a
monumental tribute to the speed and
efficiency of the Corps of Engineers of
the United States Army.
The present Canadian-Alaskan Mili-
tary Highway stretches 1600 miles
through some of the most wild and
desolate country in North America. It
starts at Dawson Creek, British Colum-
bia, 600 miles from Edmonton, proceeds
in a northwesterly direction to Fort
Nelson, then swings west through White-
horse to skirt the Kluane Lake in the
Yukon Territory, and continues north-
west across the Alaskan Boundary to
Fairbanks.
The northern end of the road passes
through Big Delta on the Richardson
Highway in Alaska, which allows the
delivery of supplies throughout Alaska.
Dawson Creek, the southern terminus,
connects directly with the railway and
highway systems of the United States
and southern Canada.
The Alcan Highway is essentially a
military road. Before its construction,
there were only two ways to supply our
garrisons in Alaska. One was by sea,
which took eight to ten days shipping
time, and tied up ships urgently needed
elsewhere. The other was by air, fast
but costly, and requiring extensive air
transport. The advent of war with Japan
intensified the situation by subjecting
the sea route to submarine attack, and
also necessitated the diversion of air-
planes to the battle areas.
Since the problem of Alaskan supply
was becoming increasingly acute during
the winter months after Pearl Harbor,
the United States Government decided
to build the long contemplated road to
Alaska. Accordingly, a formal agree-
ment was reached with the Canadian
Government on February 26, 1942. It
provided that, among other things, the
United States would pay for the con-
struction, and that the rights-of-way
would be furnished by Canada. No im-
port duties or toll charges of any kind
would be levied, and no discrimination
against the nationality of traffic would
be made. After the war is over, the road
becomes an integral part of the Cana-
dian Highway System.
The problem of construction was then
given to Major General Eugene Rey-
bold, Chief of Engineers of the United
States Army. The immediate task was
to get the road through before winter,
so as to assure an adequate supply line
to Alaska. Accordingly, his instructions
to the troop commanders were brief and
pertinent.
"A pioneer road is to be pushed to
completion with all speed within the
physical capacity of the troops."
The organization of the work was
given to Brigadier General C. L. Sturde-
vant, Assistant Chief of Engineers, while
Colonel William M. Hoge (now a Briga-
dier General) was charged with the gen-
eral conduct of the work.
The plan of the Engineers was then
two-fold. The primary objective was
to establish and maintain an overland
supply route to Alaska. In addition, the
road was to connect with and supply a
series of isolated but important airfields
in western Canada. These airports de-
pended almost entirely on air transport
for supplies and formed a chain to Alaska
over which short range fighter planes
were ferried to our northern outpost.
Since the road was a war project in
every respect, the route was selected on
the basis of military considerations.
Therefore, it differed widely from several
tourist routes that had been proposed
before the war. Its announcement, there-
fore, created a storm of protest from
some quarters. However, the actual
route follows very closely the scenic
roadway considered by the Alaskan In-
ternational Highway Commission.
After the route had been selected, and
the construction actually started, it was
found that the location for the road
presented many difficult problems. Few
adequate maps were available, and the
large scale maps in the possession of
the Engineers were not very accurate.
Terrain features were not shown and

importance as ridges, drainage, stream
crossings and rock had to be considered.
An additional problem was muskeg, a
bog moss studded with sedge. Then, too
the land was usually heavily wooded and
made rough going for the location par-
ties. They were unable to keep ahead
of the fast moving clearing crews, and
the construction was continually held up
by location.
It soon became evident that faster
methods of location were necessary.
Therefore, Canadian officials, experi-
enced in aerial location were called in
to apply their knowledge to this difficult
problem. A twin-engined monoplane of
the United States Army photographed
the region from a height of 7500 feet.
This altitude permitted a scale of
1:10,000 when the photos were over-
lapped 60 per cent. By means of stereo-
scopic projection, the engineers were
able to determine characteristic ground
features and actually to identify differ-
ent types of vegetation and trees on
the photographs. Muskeg was located
by recognizing its usual covering of
spruce, tamarac and brush. The route
of the road was then laid out on the
aerial composition map and the azi-
muths determined. These compass
readings were given to a location party
which proceeded ahead on foot and
blazed the trail for the bull-dozers.
Continual aerial reconnaissance was
necessary and was conducted by a
light seaplane which could land on small
bodies of water to investigate suspicious
localities. As far as possible, routes
along ridge lines were followed, to secure
maximum drainage. Prevailing winds
were from the south, and a road on the
southern slope of the ridges would there-
fore be relatively freer from snow.
Corduroy roads are often employed
when crossing wet boggy ground. Felled
and trimmed trees are laid crosswise,
alternating the ends to obtain maximum
strength of cross section. Gravel and
sand is spread over the top of the
timbers and the result is a semi-perma-
nent but serviceable road. A corduroy
road built over muskeg is somewhat
spongy and requires considerable main-
tenance. Therefore every effort was
made in location to avoid muskeg which
requires either complete excavation to
the clay bed, and replacing with stable
fill or extensive corduroying over the
deep layers.
Muskegs are large swampy areas of
peat-like material peculiar to Northern
Canada. They appear to be prehistoric
lakes and rivers that have filled with
glacial muck and decomposed vegetation,
the entire area usually being heavily
wooded. However, early fears of muskeg
proved to be unfounded.
By careful location it was possible
to avoid almost all of the muskeg areas.
The usual procedure was to follow the
drainage lines of the various river basins.
In one particular section 60 miles in
length that was reported to be almost
entirely muskeg, only 4 miles of it were
actually encountered.
In all, about 100 miles of the road are
corduroyed. All low spots and corduroy
were covered by at least 2 feet of gravel,

A LTHOUGH it is already fulfilling a.
•**&gt; vital role in the nation's war train-*
ing program, the College of Engineering
at the University of Michigan is prepar-
ing for even more important assignments
during the coming months.
The Army has already begun sending
engineering students to the University
and by late June is expected to have
1,500 men on the campus, the Navy is
preparing to have close to 1,000 engi-
neering students ready for classes start-
ing June 28 or July 1, while at least
1,200 civilian students are expected to
be enrolled in the summer term.
In addition, an extensive program of
Engineering, Science and Management
War Training courses will be continued
on the campus as well as in Detroit and
other cities in the state, thus placing
additional demands on the College of
Engineering faculty.
Despite the loss of 21 faculty mem-
bers due to the nation's war needs, As-
sistant Dean Alfred H. Lovell is confi-
dent that the College of Engineering is
well prepared to handle the heavier
teaching program. In the absence of
Dean Ivan C. Crawford, whose duties
as technical advisor and consultant to
the Training Division of the U. S. Navy
keep him in Washington much of the
time, Assistant Dean Lovell is serving
as supervisor of the Army Specialized
Training Program as well as handling
the many other duties resulting from
Dean Crawford's absence.
In discussing the increased teaching
burden which the summer months will
bring, Dean Lovell says careful assign-
ment of classroom space and the teach-
ing staff will permit the handling of
over 3,000 engineering students. This
number can be increased, he says, by
inverting the classroom and laboratory
schedules—that is, by switching some
laboratory sections to the morning and
changing some recitation periods to the
afternoon and vice versa.
But all of this means extra teaching
assignments for all members of the fac-
ulty who are already familiar with over-
time and evening classes, Dean Lovell
emphasizes.
Here is how he describes the situa-
tion:
"Plans were completed, effective
March 29, for an Army Specialized
Training Program covering 500 engi-
neering students who were to receive
second-half sophomore and some begin-
ning junior courses.
"However, because of insufficient time
for organization and the selection of
these men, the Army was able to send
only 141 students. When these men
were classified, it was found that their
previous training placed them in a wide
range, from freshmen courses to senior
and even graduate work.
"Plans were quickly revised, and these
men were placed in the proper classes
for a term covering 12 weeks. This term
will be concluded on June 19. With the
beginning of the next Army term on
June 8, it is expected that 500 basic
engineering students and 1,000 advanc-
ed students will be sent to the Univer-
sity under the Army Specialized Train-
ing Program.
"At approximately the same time, the
new date for starting the summer term
—June 28—will see the enrollment of
at least 900 of our regular engineering
students plus 300 incoming freshmen.
Either on June 28 or July 1, it is also
planned that we receive from the Navy
400 engineers for basic training under
the V-12 program and 600 men for ad-
vanced instruction.
"Transfer of the Post-Graduate
School of Naval Architecture and Ma-
rine Engineering from the United States
Naval Academy at Annapolis to the
University of Michigan will bring 80
Naval officers to the campus on June 28.
Instruction for this group will be pro-
vided by the Department of Naval Arch-
itecture and Marine Engineering under
the supervision of Professor Louis A.
Baier.
"In general, the Navy's college train-
ing program in engineering is similar
to regular engineering courses and pro-
vides for the customary 16-week terms.
However, the Army program is much
more specialized and since 12-week
terms are provided, it is necessary to

Professor A. H. White
SOME twenty-five hundred chemical
and metallurgical engineering stu-
dents and alumni can point with pride to
the advancement of their department
of engineering to one of the foremost in
the country under the past leadership of
Professor Alfred Holmes White.
As students under Professor White we
knew him for a relatively short time and
yet, paradoxically, learned to appreciate
more readily than others his outstand-
ing qualities as teacher, counselor and
friend. It is a small voice that we add
to those raised in the recent marking
of Professor White's seventieth birth-
day. We can not rank with educators,
scientists and alumni; yet, none was
raised more sincerely or felt more keenly
than this—the voice of the many stu-
dents whose privilege it has been to
study under Professor White, or who
have merely observed the stately, digni-
fied, white-haired gentleman walking
through the halls of East Engineering
Building.
Because Professor White seems to be
such an integral part of the University,
it is not easy to realize that he studied,
or did early teaching, at McGill Uni-
versity, Montreal; at the University of
Illinois; and at the Polytechnicum,
Zurich, Switzerland, where he did grad-
uate study under Lunge. His A.B. de-
gree, it is true, was received at Michi-
gan, but it was not until several years
later, in 1897, that he began his long
career at Ann Arbor, where he became
instructor in chemical technology, his
subject of specialization at Zurich. Pro-
fessor White's collegiate training was
in the classics and in chemistry, chem-
ical engineering being at that time un-
known.
During his early years at Michigan,
the young instructor was associated with
Edward de Mille Campbell, Albert B.
Prescott, Otis C. Johnson, and, as more
nearly a contemporary, with Moses
Gomberg. His early work on portland
cement was done with Professor Camp-
bell, and from this same unique per-
sonality his interest in metallurgical
subjects stems.
During the pre-war period, Professor
White moved through the usual aca-
demic grades of instructor, assistant
professor of chemical engineering, pro-
fessor of chemical engineering, and,
from 1907 until 1942, chairman of the
Department of Chemical Engineering.
The academic titles so listed indicate
in a general way the development of
chemical engineering at Michigan. A
chemical engineering curriculum was set
up at Michigan in 1898, located in the
Engineering Department, although the
training given in the course was pre-
dominantly chemical. At this point, it
may be of interest to note the prediction
made at the time to Professor White
by Mortimer E. Cooley; namely, that
A. H. White would see the day when
chemical engineering would constitute
the largest engineering branch at the
University of Michigan. Some 35 years
later, both Professor White and Dean
Cooley saw this prediction verified.
Much of Professor White's profes-
sional activity centered around the Am-
erican Institute of Chemical Engineers,
which owes a great deal to the time,
thought, and energy he devoted to its
affairs. He has been a member of that
society since 1914 and served as pres-
ident in 1929 and 1930. To Professor
White goes the honor of establishing
the first student chapter of that organ-
ization when he formed one here at
Michigan in 1922.
Professor White may still be met in
the halls of East Engineering although
he handed the reins of the department
to dynamic Professor George Granger
Brown in 1942.
And so it is with a deep sense of
satisfaction and egotistical pride that
we take this opportunity to offer our
congratulations to our esteemed fellow
chemical engineer, Professor Alfred
Holmes White.

fact that he spent one summer in the

ago when he drove out to Idaho in the
last car caravan to leave Detroit. In
order to finance further travels he ob-
tained a job in Idaho with the United
States Forest Service as a reserve fire-
fighter and as an inspector in blister rust
control. About a month and a half later
he left for the Idaho panhandle where
he obtained a job working on naval base
construction. His job was up on the top
of a 130 foot concrete tower. It was the
first time in his life that he had ever
been more than 20 feet off the ground.
To make matters worse, the elevator fell
from the top of the tower on the second
trip after he had taken his first ride.
It was shortly after returning from
this trip that he entered Michigan as a
sophomore. He had spent his freshman
year at Wayne but decided he would try
Michigan for a year. After his first
year here he was naturally sold on Mich-
igan as was Michigan sold on him for
he received a Donovan scholarship dur-
ing his junior year.
In his sophomore year Sid was a tryout
on the Technic. He worked so diligently
that he was unable to find time for many
other extracurricular activities and as a
result of his work he was elected to the
position of Editorial Director of the
Technic, a position which he held all
last semester. The rest of Sid's available
time was taken up by the A.I.Ch.E. Sid
is quite a music fan for he played in the
Wayne band, but when he came to
Michigan was unable to find time for
the long hours of practice required of
all members of the Michigan band.
Besides music you can get him going
by just mentioning "conservative engi-
neer," since he definitely is not one, and
takes more than the usual engineer's in-
terest in social problems. If he had his
way, the engineering program would
consist of at least two years of "Lit" in
addition to the normal four.

the construction business doing civil
engineering for contractors, during
which time he assisted on design and
field operations for several large build-
ings in Toledo and Cincinnati. He then
started in private practice and was re-
tained by the Board of Education of
Toledo as structural engineer for the
design and construction of new school
buildings. In 1911, when Professor
Riggs was appointed to the staff of the

film measurement
In order to prevent corrosion and in-
crease wearing qualities, steel bearings
used in planes and tanks are lined with
lead-bronze, copper, silver or heavy
babbitt while other steel parts often are
plated with chromium, nickel or cad-
mium. The thickness of these platings
must be accurate to the thousandth of
an inch and can now be checked at pro-
duction line speed by a new electric
gage.
In previous years the parts were
checked by one of two time consuming
methods. In one method, parts were
selected at random, cut open and the
plate thickness was measured with a
microscope. In the second method the
wall thickness was measured before and
after the lining was removed, the dif-
ference representing the thickness of the
lining.
Now, however, it is possible to
measure the thickness of a lining with-
out marring any parts. The main part
of the gage is a seven-pound portable
indicating unit with a dial marked off
in thousandths of an inch. A small cy-
lindrical gage head containing an electro-
magnet is connected to the indicating
unit by a light-weight cable. The unit
can be plugged into any ordinary a.c.
outlet.
The instrument can measure the
thickness of any nonmagnetic layer up
to 0.3 inch thick if backed up by steel.
The head sets up electric currents in the
article which vary in intensity according
to the thickness of the layer. By measur-
ing these currents, the instrument can
indicate the exact thickness on a dial
large enough to be read at production
line speed.
The gage was developed originally to
measure the thickness of paint films. It
can also measure the thickness of glass
or mica sheets providing they are backed
up by steel at the point of measurement.
A similar gage has been developed for
measuring the thickness of nonmagnetic
metal sheets and plates. This gage is
used to check the wall thickness of

magnesium and aluminum castings, and
no steel backing is necessary.
The little metal disk used to control
the temperature of electric irons is serv-
ing now as a sky fireman, ready to help
put out blazes in Uncle Sam's war-
planes. Thousands of these thermo-
stats, about the size of a half dollar,
are being produced for fire patrol in
airplanes.
Attached to motors and at other vi-
tal parts of combat planes, the thermo-
stats operate on the same principle as
factories and office buildings. If a tracer
bullet, a leaking gas tank or an over-
heated motor starts a fire, the high tem-
perature causes a bi-metal disk to move
slightly and touch two silver contacts
which close an electrical circuit. This
action flashes a light on the pilot's dash-
board, telling him which lever to pull
to release carbon dioxide and put out
the fire.
At sea, thermostats help safeguard
the air compressors that blow out guns
after firing. Mounted on the compres-
sors, the little metal sentinels flash a
signal if overheating occurs. Thus warn-
ed, engineers can correct the trouble and
keep the air compressors in condition
to maintain gun fire.
In field and base hospitals, two ther-
mostats, teamed with a three and one-
half kilowatt immersion water heater,
are used for sterilizing purposes. One
thermostat controls the temperature

Heaters equipped with thermostats
have various other wartime applications.
Keeping oil in a fluid condition in the

to keep the camera level despite flight

Radio equipment aboard planes is

ments are particularly important at pres-
ent because mills are not always able to
supply metal in certain stock sizes.
In one instance an important war item
was delayed because of slow delivery of
a large circular part. The delay was
caused by the unavailability of large
plates from which the four 9(T segments
were cut. The problem was solved by a
war worker whose job was to make full
size layouts. He suggested dividing the
circular part into six instead of four
segments because 60° segments can be
nested more closely together. This sug-
gestion saved 537,000 pounds of steel
in 1942.
smoke screens
A recently developed device for gener-
ating huge quantities of artificial smoke
has been tested by the Chemical War-
fare Center. This device creates a fog
that would form a protective covering
for the Panama Canal.
Contrary to popular opinion, the use
of smoke screens is by no means limited
to Navy maneuvers. Its value in pro-
tecting military and vital areas is ob-
vious. The new smoke generators can
mask entire industrial cities from the
eyes of attacking bombers.
The Army has been seeking an im-
proved smoke-screen generator for years;
thus, construction of developmental de-
tails and equipment and the working out
of theories was undertaken several years
ago. When the generator was completed
and tested, it was found to agree re-
markably well with theoretical calcula-

near a pit. This was done in an attempt
to fortify the road against spring thaws
and possibly avoid reconstruction.
The original basic specifications called
for the Army to build a single lane
pioneer road 12 feet wide, with 3 foot
shoulders. A minimum width of 16 feet,
with 6 foot shoulders was recognized as
desirable so that trucks might pass.
This so-called "tote" road was to be
built to supply contractors working un-
der the Public Roads Administration
who were to construct the permanent
Alcan Highway nearby. However, soon
after construction began, it was decided
to devote all of the available equip-
ment and manpower, both military and
civilian, to the rapid completion of the
pioneer road. In addition, it was found
possible, for several long stretches, to
build a full 24 foot width without losing
valuable time. Therefore, when the
pioneer road was completed in late De-
cember, it was actually a well graded,
well drained truck road suitable for
heavy traffic, with several hundred miles
of two lane pavement.
The actual construction of the road
began with the initial clearing and grad-
ing by the Army. The clearing was
accomplished by heavy 22 ton diesel
tractors with attached bulldozers. They
cleared a path 60 to 100 feet wide through
the wilderness, and worked far enough
ahead of the construction crew so that
the sun could dry out the ground and
make the grading easier. The bulldozers
were followed by heavy motor graders
which made the first blade cut. Culverts
were built of logs, small bridges con-
structed and the preliminary grading
completed. Heavy tractors and scrapers
did the final grading, shoulder widening
and ditching.
All of the bridges were temporary
affairs built of logs and timber by the
Engineers. They were strictly designed
to meet local conditions. Several of them,
as expected, went out in the spring thaw.
Ferries, rafts and pontoons were all
used in their construction.
A few corrugated metal culverts were
used, and many more will be installed
this summer.
The Army was followed up by civilian
contractors who widened and improved
the grade to a full 24 feet wherever pos-
sible. They surfaced the road with gravel
to an average depth of 18 inches.
THE ALCAN HIGHWAY
(continued from page 13)
The work was divided into two sec-
tors, with the northern headquarters at
Whitehorse, and the southern at Fort
St. John. Construction was begun simul-
taneously at several points; this facili-
tated the early completion of the road.
Crews and equipment were sent to stra-
tegic locations in March before the spring
thaw made the trails and rivers impass-
able. One regiment worked north from
Fort St. John to Fort Nelson. Other
regiments worked both north and south
from Whitehorse, while parties also
worked in Alaska. In all, seven regi-
ments of Engineers were used, number-
ing with a few other troops about 10,000
men. 6,000 civilians were also employed
on the road.
Extensive reconstruction and further
relocation started May 1 of this year,
after the spring thaw. This work is be-
ing done, as before, by American and
Canadian contractors under the super-
vision of the PRA. The roadway will
be 30 feet shoulder to shoulder in heavy
construction, 36 feet in light. The road
will have a 12 inch minimum base cover-
ing of pit run gravel or crushed stone,
over which will be laid 8 inches of 2 inch
maximum graded material and 4 inches
of 1 inch graded topping material, rolled
and compacted to present a firm, dur-
able surface.
The Corps of Engineers is to be com-
mended on its remarkable showing. It
can take justifiable pride in one of the
greatest engineering feats of all time.
The Corps performed this difficult task
in only nine months, which constitutes
the fastest road building job in history.
The Engineers used the standard mech-
anized equipment which accompanies
them into a theater of operation. And
plenty of Yankee ingenuity was em-
ployed in repairing and maintaining roll-
ing stock and field equipment. Thus it
is evident that when the Corps of Engi-
neers is dispatched to a battle area to
build roads and airfields they have the
tools, and know how to do a good job
in a hurry. We can ask no more of any
body of troops. But the real credit must
go to the enlisted men. They performed
the actual construction of this road,
unquestionably the most outstanding
achievement of the Engineers in this war.
And they did this back-breaking labor,
ten to eleven hours a day, seven days a
week, under the severest hardships ima-
ginable. The extreme weather conditions
varied from sub-zero temperatures, as
low as 35 degrees below zero to those
above 90 degrees in August. Bitter driv-
ing winds and heavy snowfall which
hampered the early spring work were
followed by a thaw which turned the
ground into a quagmire of bottomless
mud for sixty days. Infrequent rain dur-
ing the summer brought on clouds of
alluvial dust which forced the workers to
wear dust masks. Swathed in nets and
gloves, they battled swarms of vicious
flies, mosquitos, and other insects. And
almost all of the time the troops lived
a rough camp life in rugged and desolate
terrain. Yet, despite these discouraging
hardships, a high morale was maintained,
the soldiers keeping in good spirits be-
cause they knew the road was important
and speed essential.
Yet, the result of their labor, is the
real measure of this remarkable achieve-
ment. Although not a "modern" high-
way by strict professional standards, it
is a surprisingly good road considering
the construction pace and the difficulties
encountered. Built in a single work sea-
son by these men who conquered a stub-
born wilderness, a new supply route was
opened to Alaska, a project proposed
and talked about for many previous
years.
Global warfare has given Alaska great
significance in our present military poli-
cy. The shortest route from Seattle to
Tokyo is a great circle course passing
near Dutch Harbor. And Nome is the
major United States base closest to
Japan proper. Therefore the strategic
importance of Alaska cannot be denied.
The desperate attempts of the Japanese
to occupy the Aleutian Islands testifies
to this fact. One might safely surmise
that the bulk of the supplies used in
combating this menace traveled over
the new Alcan Highway. There is little
doubt that our future military policy in
the far East will be the vigorous prose-
cution of a "war of attrition" against
Japan, consisting of an all out aerial
assault and a large scale naval invasion.
The coming "Battle of Japan" will be
largely supplied from Alaskan bases be-
cause shorter supply routes are involved.
This highway will play an important
part in the development and successful
completion of this plan of vengeance.
Truly then, the Alcan Highway is our
lifeline to Alaska, our own "Burma
Road."

Molecular Keys
To A New World
Vast new sources of raw materials ... the equiva-
lent of those which might be found in a great new
continent... opened to America when Carbide and
Carbon Chemicals Corporation, a Unit of UCC,
started building synthetic chemicals from water, salt,
air, and hydrocarbons.
These chemicals are usually water-white liquids,
although some are gases or solids. Basically, they
are compounds of carbon and hydrogen—united with
oxygen or with chlorine to build up an endless sc-
ries of chemicals. The models of those molecules of
chemicals shown here are many millions of times
actual size.
These chemicals are the raw materials for fabu-
lous plastics ... amazing textile fibers ... life-saving
drugs ... vitamins by the carload ... synthetic rub-
ber ... more things and better things than were pos-
sible before their existence.
Since these chemical wonders are obtained from
abundant domestic sources, their use has contributed
materially to the nation's self-sufficiency. Through
research, American ingenuity, and patient develop-
ment, scarce natural products have been duplicated
or improved upon. Great new industries and great
new materials that contribute to the nation's strength
have come into being. And America has become a
leader in a field as native as its own soil.
Broadly speaking, the uses of many of the syn-
thetic organic chemicals developed by Carbide and
Carbon Chemicals Corporation are just begin-
ning. The already established uses are indicative of
their vast future values to mankind.

centage increase of speed becomes less
less even though the increase is the same
every time. Here a compromise in the
cyclotron is invoked. Rather than pro-
duce a uniform magnetic field, which
would be ideal as pointed out above, a
field of strength decreasing slightly
toward larger radii is produced. In the
diagram of the resulting field (Figure
3), a familiar pattern is seen. The field,
being more intense at the center, bulges
out at the edges. If the particle tended
to move up or down in such a field it
would encounter a vertical opposing
force, since it would have to cut lines of
force to maintain its radius. An anal-
ogy would be a small ball bearing speed-
ing inside a hollow doughnut. It would
tend to follow the largest circumference.
The H, therefore, which we hoped
would be constant for the sake of the
frequency, is varied somewhat for a
focusing effect. Some particles at the
larger radii will find themselves slightly
out of step, and the efficiency is in this
way reduced. But another variation in
the formula for T is encountered at high
velocities—a variation in the mass of the
particles. In the ordinary range of ex-
perience, a body weighs the same
amount whether it is moving or at rest.
However, at very high velocities the
mass turns out to be a very definite
function of velocity, a function depend-
ing on the ratio of the velocity of the
body to the velocity of light. The re-
lationship due to Einstein is
mass = m/[l — (v/c)"]*
where m is the mass of the body at rest,
v is velocity of body, and c is the veloc-
ity of light.
Obviously, since the ratio of common
velocities to the velocity of light is ex-
tremely small, the correction is insig-
nificant. But as the velocity of light is
approached, the correction becomes
great, and the mass approaches infinity
as the velocity approaches that of light
asymptotically. In this region of high
velocities developed in the cyclotron the
formula for constant frequency is again
violated. As such velocities are reached
more and more particles will get out of
step. A point will be reached where the
efficiency would become prohibitive.
Upon the invention of the cyclotron,
papers appeared announcing severe lim-
itations on it because of this phenome-
non. Since then, the limitations have
been far surpassed. The solution of the
problem has been by the use of brute
force. By applying very high voltages
on the dees, the number of revolutions
the particles must make is reduced.
Smaller chance is given them to lag be-
hind the particles which are in perfect
resonance.
Although the concern of this article
is the construction and operation of the
cyclotron, the resulting beam and its
properties and uses present an even
larger topic. A statement of the purpose
in producing a beam of particles of such
tremendous energy may be made here.
In the artificial production of elements,
elementary particles are added to the
nuclei of the stable elements. If one is
to add say, a proton to a nucleus, the
coulomb repulsion between the positively

charged nucleus and the proton must be
overcome. The force is
qXq'
d"
where q represents coulomb charge and
d represents the distance between the
charges. It is to be expected from this
formula that as d approaches zero, the
force would become infinite. In the
atomic ranges the relationship breaks
down, but the force to be overcome in
shooting one of the particles into the
other is still great. The momenta of the
particles has to be in the region of the
momenta developed in the cyclotron be-
fore the force is overcome and the pro-
jectiles pierce the bombarded nuclei.
When a deuteron—a proton plus a
neutron—penetrates a nucleus, the nu-
clear charge is increased by one unit,
and the mass by two units; and a new
element is formed.

strip the usual engineering program
down to technical essentials."
Despite all these extra demands, it
has been necessary to continue the
ESMWT (Engineering, Science and
Management War Training) program
which is carried on by the College of
Engineering under the sponsorship of
the U. S. Office of Education.
With Professor Robert H. Sherlock as
the co-ordinator, the ESMWT program
on the campus provides for the training
of ordnance material inspectors for the
Detroit Ordnance District, aircraft in-
spectors for the Army Air Forces, and
ordnance engineering aides for the Office
of Chief of Ordnance. Students for the
latter course are selected from the wo-
men employees of the various arsenals
in the country.
Technical training also is provided
in Detroit and several other Michigan
cities under the ESMWT program with
approximately half of the teaching bur-
den for these off-campus courses fall-
ing on the College of Engineering fac-
ulty. During the winter, enrollment in
the off-campus ESMWT courses was
approximately 1,250, but it is doubtful
that the summer total will be that high.
Due to the increased demands on the
College of Engineering, Professor Sher-
lock says it was felt at one time that
the ESMWT courses, at least those on
the campus, would have to be discon-
tinued. However, the Detroit Ordnance
District, the Army Air Forces, and the
Office of the Chief of Ordnance made
such vigorous protests and effectively-
stressed the need for the training pro-
grams that it was decided to continue
them.
All of this means that the College of
Engineering Classification Committee
which is in charge of assigning space and
faculty, headed by Professor Clarence
F. Kessler, must continue to do the
same skillful work which it has been
doing thus far. If necessary, any rooms
in other University buildings not being
used on a full-time basis may be re-
quested for some engineering courses.
The Army and Navy training pro-
grams for engineers require lots of co-
operation from the College of Litera-
ture, Science and the Arts, particularly
in history, geography, English, mathe-
matics, physics, and chemistry, and
also the Department of Physical Edu-
cation.

MOWING TOUR BEARINGS GETS RESULTS
JLhe war production program is a good example
of the value of "knowing your bearings". For many years
before the war, engineers were putting Timken Tapered
Roller Bearings into industrial machinery of all kinds. They
discovered long ago that these bearings possessed every qual-
ity needed to meet any type of service—friction elimination;
radial, thrust and combined load capacity; and the ability
to hold moving parts in correct and constant alignment.
Thus, when America was faced with the most tremendous
production job ever known, industry had one big advantage
—namely, production machines with the speed, precision
and endurance to do it; machines that could out-produce
any others in the world.
Now the results are beginning to tell on the world's battle
fronts—where Timken Bearing Equipped fighting machines
turned out by Timken Bearing Equipped production ma-
chines are steadily turning the tide of war in our favor.
When Victory has been won and industry calls you to
help in the work of reconstruction, you'll find a thor-
ough knowledge of Timken Bearings one of your most
valuable assets. Begin to get it now.

covering over a large oil tank farm. The
latter type oil tanks, gas tanks, and re-
fineries are hard to conceal merely by
disruptive painting because round forms
are always very conspicuous.
Small factories, producing some vital
part or instrument, can be and are being
placed completely underground. In Eng-
land there are many such, one of which
built in an abandoned chalk mine em-
ploys over 6000 workers. Germany has
constructed many such and is rapidly
doing so now. The Germans have also
dispersed many small factories, conceal-
ing them within heavy pine forests where
they are quite safe, summer and winter.

officers must instruct their men to place
their guns, park their trucks or stand
their planes where the shadow will fall
on or blend with existing shadows on the
ground, whether from trees, buildings,
hedges, walls, or ditches.
Painting or concealing men and equip-
ment is of little value, however, if tell-
tale wheel tracks or footpaths lead from
all sides to the place of concealment or
if fires or lights at night, broken branches,
black ashes, and military articles are
scattered about. A single soldier pacing
across a grass field will leave a mark as
clear as day on an aerial photograph.
The moral is that tracks and footpaths

Oil Tank Farm After Camouflage
of thr Military EnRinnr
Perhaps most of the readers of this
are more interested in protection of
military personnel and equipment. The
article by Major Breckenridge in the
May first Saturday Evening Post shows
how far the camouflage of the soldier
has proceeded. A recent number of Lijc
shows the camouflage painting of planes
and the netting of an underground ob-
servation station in Tunisia. The familiar
olive drab of uniforms, guns, trucks, etc.,
is a "toning down" and "blending" to
reduce visibility and to harmonize with
the average surroundings. Large trucks'
and guns are treated further with a
varied color pattern to disrupt the form
and to confuse the observer. Any amount
of painting, however, will not destroy
the shadow of the vehicle in sunlight or
be used to fool the enemy by marking
the location of a false position.
Dummy equipment, if there is time
and material to make it, is very effective
in drawing the attack into a false posi-
tion. The men can have gleeful sport
in watching the enemy bomb the "stuff-
ing" out of a burlap plane or a cotton
tank. A large metal pan partly filled
with oil and waste on the roof of a
dummy building can, if a bomb falls
nearby, be lighted and make a fine blaze.
The bomber crew can then report great
success in starting "a fire seen 30 miles
away."
Perhaps from a strategic point of view
the most important military installation
is the airdrome. More study by camou-
fleurs is being given to this than to any
other type of target. Naturally the army
is not showing what it has done in this
important matter but the reader of this
is invited to the small camouflage labo-
ratory in the Architecture building
where a study is being made, by use of
a model, of the camouflage of a typical
civil airport, assuming that it is being
used for military purposes. The visitor
will find other studies being made there
also of planes, nets, small factories, etc.,
and examples of a dummy 105 mm. how-
itzer, and 6 machine guns at full scale.
On the airport the wide, smooth diagonal
and crossed runways are especially hard
to conceal as are the large hangars.
The planes themselves, hangars, and
barracks must be widely dispersed and
concealed over an area of sometimes
3 or 4 square miles, making use of
woodland margins, trees, shrub patches,
hedgerows, edges of fields and ditches,
or anything of contrasting prominence
which will draw attention from the form
of the plane and its shadow.
While advisory camouflage officers are
to be appointed for each regiment or
airbase, every commanding officer is re-
sponsible for the camouflage and dis-
cipline of his particular command. So
it behooves every man who is looking
'forward to officer training to read, ob-
serve, understand, and scheme in this
matter of protective concealment.
THE CYCLOTRON
(continued from page 26)
If the new element is not an allowed
isotope, it will be unstable and will dis-
integrate to a stable isotope of itself, a
new element, or even the original one.
Understanding these reactions, identify-
ing and measuring the radiation, and fix-
ing the isotope of the end product, are
the task of the nuclear physicist. In do-
ing so he is determining the relationships
between elements as the chemist has be-
tween compounds.
While this field is being well explored,
more powerful equipment is being de-
veloped for further disfiguring the nu-
cleus. Instead of jumping from element
to element in small steps, this new
equipment will accomplish the task in
larger strides. A glimpse into the future
of this work has been revealed by the
figures on the power released in the fis-
sion of a Uranium isotope. Better cy-
clotrons and new and different high volt-
age accelerators may well bring us the
impossible things of which the alchem-
ists dreamed.

THE MICHICAN TECHNIC


IT'S fashionable in some quarters to
talk of America as a nation that lets
clever people like the Germans run
circles around it in technical skill. We
have a hunch the idea comes from Dr.
Goebbels' propaganda factory in Berlin.
Anyway, it's not true.
In the glass field, for example, America
was surprisingly well prepared for war.
Take Laboratory glassware, vital in the
manufacture of dyes, explosives, foods,
and many war supplies, as well as to
health. In 1914 we depended upon
Germany for this material. But in 1915
Corning developed Pyrex brand lab-
oratory ware and now this country needs
German glass no more than it needs
German wheat!
Despite war's demand, Corning is keep-
ing pace with laboratory ware, insula-
tors, communication equipment, and
signal glassware required for planes and
ships. Chemical industries are getting
necessary quantities of glass piping, acid
pumps, and glass mechanical parts that
replace scarce metal alloys. Even glass
precision gauges (ring, plug and others)
are now being produced that are in many
ways superior to ones made of steel.
These are just a few of the war-impor-
tant items flowing out of Corning today.
The main point is that when the national
need arose, Corning research had al-
ready explored the things that non-
critical glass could do to replace ma-
terials vital to war effort and was ready
to help. Yes, to the engineer glass is
really important today, and promises to
be more so after the war is over.
That's why the best advice we can
think of for you is this: Keep up-
to-date on glass! Corning Glass
Works, Corning, New York.

Perhaps his senior classmates will re-
member him best as being chairman of
the last J-Hop to be held on this campus
for the duration. They remind us that
under Ted's leadership, this was one of
the finest social events of its kind.

Ted Sharp
Ted started as an Aeronautical Engi-
neer. In fact, he graduated from De-
troit's largest technical high school and
received the highest honor presented
annually to the most promising gradu-
ate. Since that time, however, he has
transferred to Metallurgical Engineering
and now spends a great deal of his leisure
time working in the met. lab.
At present, Ted claims to have no
serious troubles. His greatest worry was
erased when his draft board decided to
allow him to graduate and accept a posi-
tion in industry. After graduation in
May, Ted will work with the Dodge
Aircraft Plant in Chicago.
In athletics Ted keeps busy at tennis
and baseball, but at the moment a leg
injury keeps him from any active par-
ticipation. Ted has seen a good deal of
the United States and claims the dis-
tinction of swimming in both oceans and
the Gulf of Mexico.

The next time you hear the drone of
airplane motors, look around and you'll
probably see Madison Lent-Koop peer-
ing intently into the sky. Aeronautics
has always been Mad's chief interest,
which probably accounts for his deci-
sion to study Aeronautical Engineering.
At Michigan he belonged to the Glider
Club until a couple of the gliders were
wrecked and the club disbanded.
When asked what he does in his spare
time, Mad replied, "What spare time?"
He has been teaching E. M. 2A for two
semesters now and is a Technic man
of long standing, having done most of
the drawing for the art department.
He's well versed in Greek, too; Tau
Beta Pi, Phi Eta Sigma, and Sigma
Rho Tau all claim him for membership.
Acacia initiated him when he was a
freshman.
Mad was no slouch in high school
either. He attended McKenzie High in
Detroit and graduated the highest man
in his class. He made National Honor
Society, summa cum laude, and was on
the paper for a year. He began as lead-
ing man in the class play, but after a
week decided he lacked ability as an
actor and was made stage manager.

Madison Lent-Koop
After graduation in May, a job awaits
Mad at the Aeronca Aircraft Plant in
Middletown, Ohio. He will be a junior
engineer in the design and production
department, but may not hold his job
long; his 2A classification terminates
in July.
If it weren't for his technical ability
Madison would make a good traveling
salesman. He's covered most of the
United States in his wanderings and
casts his vote for the West as the most
ideal section of the country. After the
war he would like to work in an aircraft
plant in California—well, what engineer
wouldn't?
Mad is definitely not a frequenter of
local grog shops. He claims he has had
only four beers since he has been on
campus, which is quite a record. At
present, he is concentrating his powers
as a B.T.O. on a freshman from Flint.
In fact she's taking care of his frater-
nity pin for him.

PROBLEM
Joe Ralston is a junior in an engineer-
ing college taking 8 hours of courses
along with holding a full-time job in
the welding department of a nearby de-
fense plant. Joe's courses last fall in-
cluded Chemical Technology from Pro-
fessor Redman.
One day in class, Professor Redman
mentioned that lithium salts had been
found to be useful for welding fluxes
for special alloys containing aluminum,
but this had been too expensive to in-
terest manufacturers. Joe raised ques-
tions concerning this practice, and Pro-
fessor Redman referred him to a senior
thesis completed some eight years earl-
ier which contained experimental results
using lithium salts as welding fluxes.
The defense plant had been having
difficulty welding alloys akin to those
in the thesis, and so Joe tried a series
of lithium compounds. By a series of
experiments he found a lithium salt
which had been marketed at a reason-
able price about three years ago and
which gave excellent welds, permittine
a high increase in plant output.
After several months of full produc-
tion using the new flux, the defense
plant receives the coveted Army-Navy
'E" award and the plant manager asks
Joe by letter to accept the award for
them, saying in part: 'We would like
you to accept the 'E' award for our com-
pany at the ceremonies, since your dis-
covery of the new welding process, more
than any other contribution, has made
possible the production attained by our
plant."
How would you write Joe's reply to
the plant manager's letter.

SLICING DAYS OFF SHIPBUILDING SCHEDULES...
UNTIL recently, cutting hatchway
openings out of heavy deck plat-
ing was a bottleneck in the construction
of certain types of ships. It was a slow,
costly job requiring many laborious
machining operations.
Could the oxyacety lene flame eliminate
this bottleneck? This was the problem
presented to Airco's research engineers
by one of its customers. The problem was
solved by an entirely new gas cutting
machine, designed and constructed spe-
cifically to handle this job.
With this machine it is possible to cut
beveled openings, rounded at the cor-
ners, out of thick steel plate —all in a
single continuous operation! The finished
cut is smooth and clean, and more im-
portant, the openings are cut in 1/120th

WHAT DO WE LACK?
What is wrong with the average en-
gineer? An all-campus poll of Michi-
gan coeds showed that socially, engi-
neers rate third among the colleges. Sig-
nificantly, numerous coeds stated that
because engineers think of everything
in terms of the slide rule, they prove
to be dull companions.
This seems to be the typical Literary
College impression. It is further evi-
denced by the feud between the Lit
students and the 'illiterate' engineers,
and by the fact that the engineering
faculty is generally considered the most
reactionary group on campus. The en-
gineering student is not included with
the faculty here because he is considered
to have no opinion of his own on mat-
ters other than engineering.
A large number of recent articles
written by prominent men, particularly
successful engineers, support this atti-
tude by pointing out that the typical
engineering curriculum is too technical
and is lacking in cultural and human-
istic social content.
Michigan's Dean Emeritus Mortimer
E. Cooley, in a recent issue of the
A.S.C.E. publication, expressed his great
disappointment in the progress which
has been made in giving the engineer
a more liberal education.
In the April issue of The Bent of Tau
Beta Pi, Mr. Lowell A. Stewart, a suc-
cessful practising engineer, summed this
negative factor in the engineer's make-
up: "A broader engineering curriculum
will need to develop a less skeptical in-
terest by the engineer in the social and
phychological factors that influence and
affect his career.
"The typical engineering student is
only mildly interested in these things.
He is reluctant to deal with them as he
deals with the forces of nature. Because
he fails to understand them he avoids
them, and he under-estimates their to-
tal importance. Each of us, as he en-
visages the world of the future, tends
to concentrate his attention on particu-
lar aspects which are of importance to
him. At each branch in his career-road
the engineer evaluates the future pos-
sibilities of each alternate route and
chooses the one that leads where he
thinks he wishes to go. In most instances
the routes that have some political or
social or economic signs on them are
avoided by the engineer."
Let us consider some of the possible
effects of this glaring deficiency in the
engineer's education. Broadly speaking,
the end of man's struggle for material
wants is evidenced by the machine age—
the engineer its master. Professor Pres-
ton Slosson has stated that the greatest
trouble with the world is the fact that
our means of satisfying material wants
has far outstripped the development of
our social and political institutions. The
engineer must now take cognizance of
a statement made by Homer P. Rainey,
President of the University of Texas—
"Wherever man has in his possession
power over other individuals and other
lives, whether it be mechanical power
or economic power or scientific power,
he has it within his ability greatly to
influence and affect human lives and hu-
man destinies."
In short the engineer must make up
his deficiencies since he must obviously
help to effect, in President Rainey's
words, "—some mechanism for bringing
together the knowledge and the science
that we have and applying them to the
solution of our human and social prob-
lems."
It is quite evident that our most
prominent engineers have made them-
selves personally responsible for over-
coming these deficiencies—which prob-
ably has much to do with their being
prominent. Such men, possessing keen
insight into their social and political
environment, are capable of and do ac-
complish great feats of human progress.
Educators are obviously agreed that
the trend in post-war engineering edu-
cation will lead to the end of the saga
of the trade school. Meanwhile engi-
neers in school today have the patrio-
tic responsibility of getting as much as
they can out of college in the shortest
possible time. The thing to do then is
to 'take the bull by the horns' and make
the best of the situation. The engineer
is required to take six hours of non-
technical electives. Extremely careful
choice must be made of these electives.
The course, Social Studies 93, is herein
brought to attention and particularly
recommended. This two-hour lecture
course deals with the problems of the
war and of the peace. Fifteen of the
Literary College's most capable profes-
sors from the departments of political
science, history, geography, sociology,
and economics give their expert know-
ledge and viewpoints in these lectures.
Engineers who have taken the course
are extremely enthusiastic about the
broad, yet not superficial, picture which
is presented of the world today.
The people of the United States have
expressed faith in the engineering stu-
dent by allowing him to remain in school.
The drafted Lit student has thrown the
torch of liberal education to the engi-
neer. Can he keep faith? Does he have
the intellectual 'guts' to assume this
responsibility and opportunity? It re-
mains to be seen.

A recent investigation of die spring breakage
developed the following prominent causes:
1. Hydrogen embrittlement resulting from plat-
ing, pickling or cleaning.
2. Incorrect die design.
3. Incorrect spring size.
4. Speed of compression cycle.
5. Poor quality of wire.
There are, fortunately, remedies for all these con-
ditions. Hydrogen embrittlement can be corrected
by heating plated springs to about 450°F. and air
cooling.
Faults in die design usually consist of either
insufficient or too great clearance between the

DATA ON MOLYBDENUM APPLICATIONS.

outside diameter of the spring and the guide hole.
The clearance should be such that the spring
operates freely, but has no chance to buckle.
Care should be taken in selecting springs to see
that they are properly designed for both length of
compression stroke and speed of compression. If
springs are repeatedly compressed too close to
their solid height, quick failure will result. The
same is true where the rapidity of compression is
too great.
It seems obvious that the quality of the spring
wire should be commensurate with the job. Cheap
wire should be avoided because of defects that are
bound to cause trouble, especially when springs
are plated.

... The army's new smoke generator,
proved a lifesaver in the invasion of
Sicily, according to a statement by
Major General William N. Porter,
chief of the Army Chemical Warfare
service.
"Smoke is our greatest protective
weapon," said General Porter. "It is
the greatest lifesaver of our troops and
was responsible for the small number
of casualties in Sicily where it was
used."
... This is the second time that com-
mendations have been given to the
smoke generator by the army. When
the American forces landed in North
Africa, they were protected by a pall
of dense white smoke that poured out
of these wheeled machines, completely
concealing their movements, and yet
of no discomfort to the troops.
... Both ammunition and manpower
formerly used in testing the sights of
Garand semi-automatic rifles for the
U. S. Army, are saved with a new de-
vice which was only recently developed.
Formerly, the accuracy of the sights
was tested at the Springfield Arsenal
by actually firing the rifles. With the
new apparatus, however, a plug holding
a mirror is inserted into the end of the
barrel of the gun, which is held in a
special stand. The mirror reflects an
image of an illuminated cross on a
screen. Images of the front and rear
sights are also reflected to nearby
screens, and in that way their accuracy
is checked.
... A refrigerated container, originally
developed for transporting small quan-
ties of perishable foods that require
temperature protection in transit, is now
Leing used to carry blood from Red
Cross collecting centers to laboratories
where it is processed into plasma for
shipment to America's armed forces
overseas. These containers, designed
Major Elihu Church, look like large
trunks. Made of galvanized steel and
mounted on casters so that they may
be moved easily, they have an insula-
tion thickness of four inches and a capa-
city of ten cubic feet. A bunker, which
may be loaded with either 100 pounds
of dry ice or 90 pounds of ice water,
provides the low temperatures required
in the transportation of blood.
... The job of reading a drawing and
thoroughly visualizing a piece of com-
plicated apparatus in completed form
is sometimes difficult, even for the
technically trained man, and for this
reason models can play a real part in
speeding up war production. They
have a three dimensional advantage
over a drawing, and thus can be used,
not only to facilitate understanding of
apparatus to be built, but also to work
out problems in design.
... By improving the lighting in a for-
mer corset making plant, now making
escape-parachutes, a Detroit manufac-
turer has increased parachute produc-
tion SO per cent. When the factory
was transformed to making parachutes
after the attack on Pearl Harbor, it
was found that the old lighting equip-
ment just would not do. The superin-
tendent's recommendations included
fluorescent lighting for general and
local needs, as well as proper bulbs in

AN EXPRESSION OF FAITH
IJV AMERICA
RECENTLY, Goodyear dedicated a
new home for its bold and manifold
research activities, now concentrated on
war products.
Gathered here, in vast array, are the
most modern instruments of scientific dis-
covery—not only in the fields of natural
rubber, synthetic rubber and its kindred
plastics—but in fields also ranging even
to aerodynamics and metallurgy.
More than a million dollars went into
this building and its equipment. It is,
we believe, the finest laboratory for its
purpose in the world.
Out it is not the completion of the
structure which we emphasize here.
It is rather the beginning of a new
advance—an advance already launched
by the limitless demands of war, which
will surely gain momentum with the
peace to come.
For Goody ear's growth has stemmed not
from the accumulation of properties or
from finance — but from fertility of the
mind and the serviceability of the prod-
ucts which this fertility brought forth.
From the beginning Goodyear has stead-
fastly stressed research to advance the
usefulness and value of its products.
It was this constant quest for improve-
ment which, in the early days, originated
the first straight-side tire.
It brought forth the first pneumatic
tire for trucks and farm tractors—the
first low pressure tire for airplanes.
It brought cotton, rayon and nylon cord
tires to their high perfection.
It produced Pliofilm and Airfoam, twin
advances in packaging and cushioning.
It developed the never-equaled Compass
transmission belt.
It perfected bullet-puncture-sealing fuel
tanks for airplanes.
It enabled America's first all-synthetic
tire, produced by Goodyear in 1937.
And for 28 years now, it has won popular
tribute, expressed in the fact that more
people ride on Goodyear tires than on
any other kind.
We cannot predict what this laboratory
will bring forth in future.
But in the realm of possibilities—from
the developments spurred by war—i3
such a range of products as nailablc
glass, wafer-thin insulating materials,
hundred-mile conveyor belt systems,
non-freezable plastic water pipes, metal-
wood laminations for car and airplane
bodies, mildew proof tents and awnings,
static-free radio, all-welded airplane
fabrication, crashproof airplane fuel
tanks, and many like wonders on which
we are now at work.
Tliese will dictate in significant measure
"the shape of things to come," forecast-
ing the fullness of life which is ours to
conceive and realize when peace returns.
So what we have dedicated is not a
building, but the talents which this
building is built to serve.
It is our aim to make it forever true of
Goodyear, as of life in America, that
"the best is yet to com'.''

the spotlights attached to the sewing
machines. Nylon, instead of silk, is
used in nearly every part of the main
parachute and the baby "pilot" 'chute.
Panels, shroud lines, webbing, and
thread are snow white. Contrast is
practically nil. But the manufacturer,
with his expert knowledge of what light
can do to improve seeing conditions, put
it to work in a way that has led to fas-
ter production and better parachutes.
... A machine gun, which uses plastic
pellets and compressed air instead of
expensive bullets and gunpowder, yet
provides all the racket and recoil vibra-
tions of a wartime antiaircraft weapon,
has been developed by Uncle Sam to
use in training his soldiers at less cost.
This gun, which operates by electri-
city, will fire 600 rounds of the plastic
bullets per minute, the same rate as
the 50-calibre Browning machine gun.
Whereas SO-calibre bullets cost approxi-
mately 30 cents each, making the cost
$180 per minute for operation of the
Browning gun, the plastic pellets cost
less than one cent each and can be used
over and over again, with an occa-
sional soap and water washing.
The gun is built to actual size and
appearance of the Browning type. It
is handled exactly like one, except that
its operation in an a scale of 1 to 30.
Thus when fired at miniature buildings
and tanks, or airplanes zooming across
the sky at a distance of 50 feet it
simulates firing an actual gun at 500
yards.
Pellets velocity and trajectory are
according to scale, hence the trainee
learns correctly to "lead" a moving tar-
get and to aim his gun by the stream
of white pellets, which become fluores-
cent at night in the "black light" of an
ultra-violet spotlight attached to the
gun. Fluorescent targets are also used
at night.
Amplified "explosions" of compressed
air accustom the trainee to the distrac-
tions of actual muzzle blast and the
recoil and recordings of dive bombers
and other battle sounds produced by
a loud speaker tend to eliminate the
jitters he might otherwise experience in
his first combat firing. The training
gun can be used indoors or out. It can
be mounted on standards for use on the
ground, or in a truck or combat car.
Engineers perfected the gun a little
over a year ago. Since then many have
been made which are now in use by

... Because a hot summer sun will ex-
pand a 400 foot steel ship as much as

final welds at night. The source of the
acetylene used in this operation is cal-
cium carbide.

as a solvent and cleaner is now being
used. The newly developed product
is described as a volatile, water-white
methalated hydro-carbon solvent, which
evaporates clean and is non-inflammable
and non-explosive. It is a "non-polar"
solvent and does not tend to rust or
corrode ferrous metals. The makers

than carbon tetrachloride.

planes may some day be brought about
by a new Diesel fuel just recently pa-

and therefore presents a much lower
fire hazard. However, inside the Diesel
engine, it burns at a lower temperature
and pressure than the ordinary Diesel
fuels. Due to this lower pressure, the new

The Oii business
is a great chemical industry
A recent book on chemicals says that American
motorists, when they were allowed to use their
cars, burned enough gasoline each year to fill
Great Salt Lake twice over. Great Salt Lake is
80 miles long, 20 to 30 miles wide and averages
18 feet deep.
Since oil yields only about 25% of gasoline in
straight run distillation, this would have meant
fantastic over-production of the lighter and
heavier "cuts."
To meet this situation, the oil industry "man-
ufactures" gasoline by building up the lighter
hydrocarbons and breaking down the heavier
ones. Normally, more than half the gasoline
we burn is "manufactured," most of it from
oil fractions that originally contained no gaso-
line at all.
To do this, the oil business has become one of
the greatest chemical industries in America.
Koppers, too, is a great chemical business.
Working with coal derivatives, it is currently
helping the oil industry make more 100-octane
gasoline by furnishing coal tar benzene for a
• chemical process which improves the octane rating of
low-octane gasoline.
Koppers is also furnishing to the oil industry: plants
for purifying gas . . . piston rings . . . self-aligning coup-
lings . . . pressure-treated timber and other products.

Diesel engine can be made lighter and
less bulky than the typical Diesel en-
gin. Its lighter weight will make it com-
pare favorably with the gasoline engine
for airplane use.
The new process merely involves the
treatment of present Diesel fuels with
Nitric acid to form a Nitrate. The
nitration may be speeded up by the
addition of Sulphuric acid, and may be
carried out at room or higher tempera-
tures.
... A new type of lacquer has been de-
veloped that can be used to determine
the approximate magnitude of strain in a
piece of stressed material. The lacquer
is sprayed on a part to be tested and
after the lacquer has dried, the piece
is loaded until cracks appear in the sur-
face of the lacquer; the magnitude of
the cracks is proportional to the amount
of strain.
In one test, the lacquer coating was
sprayed on a 1600 pound model of a
gear tooth and the tooth squeezed in a
large hydraulic press to locate the
stresses. At the same time and under
the same conditions, a foot-long steel
bar was sprayed with the material. The
bar was then bent in a machine which
held one end rigid and depressed the
other. The magnitude of the cracks de-
creased as you proceed from the rigid-
ly held end to the free end. A strain
scale was placed beside the point where
the last crack occurred, and the read-
ing at this point gave the least amount
of strain required to crack the lacquer.
This method can be used to deter-
mine the vulnerable spots in gears,
shafts, valves and other pieces of war-
time equipment. It may also aid in
developing tougher armor and better
armor-piercing shells.
... In order to guard the lives of
United States troops aboard ocean
transports, a new inflatable life belt has
been designed. The belt, worn night
and day, can keep the heaviest soldier
afloat indefinitely. The belt is inflated
by two small bullets of compressed
liquid carbon dioxide, similar to the
cartridges used to charge home syphons
in peacetime. Upon release by a quick
squeeze of a valve lever, the liquid ex-
pands to 40 times its stored volume—
enough to fill two balloons eight inches
in diameter.

PLASTICS—products of industrial initiative
Plastics are a stimulating source of inspiration
for architects and industrial designers in search
of new ideas. When these intriguing materials
are released from their military commitments,
innumerable applications for the home fron
will arise. No products offer a better example of
how progress can be accomplished when indus-
try is given free rein to its initiative.
As a producer of basic chemicals needed for the
manufacture of plastics, Dow is in a particularly
fortunate position to promote their develop-
ment. Three major Dow plastics—Styron,
Ethocel and Saran—have already been produced.
They possess distinctive properties that permit a
bewildering array of uses in almost every field of
human activity. There are also varieties of Dow
plastic materials for coatings, finishes and other
purposes in the electrical, textile and many
other industries.
These plastic products do more than supplant
other materials. They are veritable points of
departure that lead to fresh fields. When normal
conditions return, self-reliant industry, expand-
ing on its own resources, will develop and apply
them for the greater well-being of all America.

THE MICHICAN TECHNIC


By
CORWIN E. DENNY, '43 E
THE idea of the helicopter was con-
ceived long before anyone even
imagined the conventional airplane as
we know it today. In the 16th century,
da Vinci built small toy helicopters and
flew them in his laboratory. In spit?
of the fact that da Vinci's experiments
with his toy helicopters led many peo-
ple to question his sanity, some of his
theories have now been proven quite
sound. Following da Vinci's death,
the concept of flight by rotating wings
was temporarily forgotten until the end
of the nineteenth centry when experi-
ments were again begun. At this time
however, helicopter development was
again forgotten when Wilbur and Or-
ville Wright perfected the conventional
airplane.
In the 1920's a Spaniard by the nanu-
of Cierva developed the autogiro and
its popularity soon spread to England.
It was believed in some circles that the
autogiro was a milestone in aviation
history and had a great future. The
fate of the autogiro is well known, but
it must be remembered that the auto-
giro differs greatly from the modern
helicopter. The autogiro is pulled
through the air by a conventional pro-
peller and the rotor merely supplies the
lifting force by turning slowly in the
airstream. The helicopter, on the other
hand, has no conventional propeller and
all motion, forward or upward, is
provided by the motor driven rotor.
Unlike the helicopter, therefore, it can-
not ascend and descend vertically nor
can it attain the high speed and econ-
omy of the airplane. There were sev-
eral principles evolved from the auto-
giro experiments which have greatly
aided the successful development of the
helicopter. The most important prin-
ciple discovered by Cierva was the hing-
ing of the rotor blades at the rotor hub
to eliminate lateral lift unbalance and
gyroscopic moments. The autogiro has
served as a very valuable intermediate
between the airplane and the helicopter.
Recently, helicopter development has
advanced rapidly. In Germany, a heli-
copter has been engineered by Focke
which consists of two laterally displaced
rotors turning in opposite directions in

The author is a recent graduate of the
University of Michigan, where he received
bis B.S. degree in Aeronautical Engineering
in January 1943. While a student here, he
u'as a member of Sigma Phi Epsilon and
the flying club, having received his Private
Pilot's License in 1939. He was interested
in helicopters even before he entered col-
lege, and during his college days he de-
signed and built several of the more im-
portant parts of a helicopter. These ideas
were later used on the experimental heli-
copter which he and Karl Shakel finished
about two months ago. While waiting to
obtain funds to continue their work, Car-
win is serving as an Associate Professor of

School of Aeronautics in Talsa, Oklahoma.
order to balance the torque. The de-
gree of success attained by the Focke
machine is unknown. In America, as
its widely known, Igor I. Sikorsky has
pioneered the helicopter field. The
Sikorsky machine consists of one cen-
trally located rotor with a vertically
mounted torque-compensating propeller
at the rear of the ship.
The progress of helicopter develop-
ment has been hampered until recently
mainly due to the lack of an adequate
means of control and stability. As men-
tioned previously, Cierva solved the
stability problem by hinging the blades
and permitting them to flap freely in a
vertical plane as well as having free-
dom in a drag direction. This advance-
ment was then replaced by cyclic pitch
control. While cyclic pitch was sug-
gested for helicopters many years ago.
it remained for Sikorsky to successfully
apply the method. In order to attain
horizontal translation in a helicopter,
it is necessary to tilt the resultant left
vector to give an adequate horizontal
component of force in the direction in
which motion is desired so as to over-
come the total drag at any given air-
speed. Early helicopter enthusiasts at-
tempted to tilt the rotor and rotor drive
shaft as a unit or to tilt the complete
machine. In spite of the fact that it
is almost impossible to tilt a large ro-
tating mass with any degree of accurate
control due to the gyroscopic forces,
this method was tried.
Cyclic pitch control provides a means
of tilting the resultant lift vector with-
out moving the rotor drive shaft or
changing the attitude of the machine.
Control is exercised by periodically
varying the angle of incidence of each
blade per revolution. As an example,
in forward flight the incidence angle, or
"bite", of all the rotor blades is increas-
ed as they pass through the rear por-
tion of the path and decreased in travel-
ing through the front part of their path.
Thus, an increment of lift is added to
the rotor disc and an increment sub-
tracted from the front part. The ef-
fect is that the resultant lift vector is
tilted forward and a horizontal com-
ponent of force results to propel the
machine forward.
The largest problem yet to be solved
in the helicopter is the elimination of
fuselage torque. According to New-
ton's third law, to every action there
is an equal and opposite reaction; thus
the fuselage will tend to rotate in a di-
rection opposite to the rotation of the
rotor. The torque must be compensat-
ed for, in order to keep the machine
in equilibrium while in flight. In order
to give an idea of the magnitude of the
torque imparted to the fuselage, a 100
Horsepower engine will be considered
driving a rotor at 250 RPM, which is
typical for a two-place helicopter. Ap-
proximately 70/v of the total power
actually will be absorbed by the rotor
therefore an efficiency factor of 0.7 must
be applied.
Hp.=Horsepower
Q =Torque
n —RPM
substituting:
100 x 0.7 x 550=2 x TT x Q x 250 / 60
solving for Q:
Q = 100 x 0.7 x 550 x 60 / 2 x TT x 250
= 1470 ft. pounds

JUST as the history of man may be
divided into eras termed "Stone
Age," "Iron Age," and "Bronze Age"
so may the history of Modern Metal-
lurgy be separated into the "Steel Age,"
the "Middle Alloy Age," and the "Light
Alloy Age."
Previous to the Steel Age of Metal-
lurgy—the 19th Century—a number of
the metallic elements were well known
and several alloys were in use by man.
The metals, except for some native gold,
silver, and copper, were rarely pure
and the few alloys, such as statuary
bronze, varieties of coinage, and Da-
mascus steel, were made by family
recipes, usually fabulous and often
secret, being handed down from father
to son.
THE STEEL AGE—
This period may be said to extend
from 1800 to about 1916. During this
time better control methods were devel-
oped for operating the blast furnace;
the basic and acid open hearth furnaces
were developed; the Bessemer conver-
ter was originated; crucible methods of
melting and pouring were more highly
developed; the importance and func-
tions of oxygen, sulphur, and phospho-
rous as impurities in steel were recogniz-
ed; and the fundamental principles and
methods for the modern production of
carbon and alloy steels became part of
our knowledge.
The use of copper in electrical ap-
paratus was initiated with Thomas Edi-
son's marvelous inventions. The brass
and bronze industries of to-day had
their inception late in the nineteenth
century. Aluminum, as a metal, was
a rarity even though it was used to
cap the Washington monument. Metal-
lic magnesium was available, at first,
as a rare chemical, and, toward the
last, as a flashlight powder. The exis-
tence of beryllium as an element in the
chemist's Periodic Table was recognized
but its metallic properties were large-
ly unknown. Toward the last of the
nineteenth century, the use of the
microscope was applied to the study of

the crystalline structures of steel and
other alloys and this heralded the birth
of modern metallurgy.
THE MIDDLE ALLOY AGE—
Most of us who have completed high
school education during the past 30
years have been either subjected to or
entranced by the science of chemistry.
Thus there are many to-day who know
of the chemist's Periodic Table, so
descriptive and even prophetic of the
chemical properties of the elements. Of
the 92 elements listed, from hydrogen,
No. 1, to uranium, No. 92, more than
two-thirds are metals. From 1916 to
1942, in general, the major metallur-
gical developments were largely con-

cerned with metals in the middle half
of the numerical series of the Periodic
Table: the iron-base alloys including
the carbon and alloy steels; the stain-
less alloys of iron-chromium-nickel; ths
extraordinarily powerful permanent
magnet compositions based on alloy ra-
tios of iron, nickel, aluminum, and
cobalt; the silicon steels for transform-
ers, those magicians of the electric power
industry; refinements in the brass and
tin-bronze industries; development of al-
loys of copper with silicon, chromium
and silicon, aluminum, nickel and sili-
con, manganese, cadmium, aluminum
and iron, etc.; copper brazing; the sil-
ver solders; chromium plating; the tin
and lead-base Babbitt bearing alloys:
leaded brasses, bronzes, and leaded
steels; and a literal multitude of other
alloys. There are always exceptions
and, to the developments in the middle
list of metals, must be added the com-
mercial use of heavy tungsten as lamp
filaments, in machine tool alloys, and as
a sintered carbide cutting and abrasive
material; also, the establishment of the
aluminum, alloy industry and the birth
of the magnesium and the beryllium al-
loy industries.
THE LIGHT ALLOY AGE, 1942—?
To-day the names of the three light
metals, magnesium, beryllium, and alu-
minum are known to almost everyone
who knows that the world is at war.
These name feature newspaper articles,
scientific reports, War Production Board
sessions, and popular radio science pro-
grams. The production of aluminum,
already a full grown industry in the
Middle Alloy Age, is being increased
many times over. The production of
magnesium has been increased about
100-fold, from 6 million pounds per
year to nearly 600 million pounds per
year, during the past three years.
Beryllium, because of its surprisingly
powerful effects on properties of alloys
to which it is added in only small
amounts, really wears a cloak of necro-
mancy. Based on the ages of a man.
beryllium is just out of kindergarten.

listed in the order of their increasing
atomic weights. In an adjacent column
are listed their densities, the weights in
grams of cubic centimeter of each
material at the temperature of 68°F.
Aside from economics, the chemical
and physical properties (such as melting
point, ductility, strength, oxidation, and
corrosion resistance) determine whether
these metals and their alloys will be of
use to engineers as machinery and struc-
tural materials.
Thus lithium, sodium, potassium,
and calcium are far too active chemical-
ly, in the presence of oxygen and water
(or water vapor), to serve as engineer-
ing materials. However, this particular
characteristic leads to their chief im-
portance, in metallurgy, as deoxydizing
agents added to the melts of certain
alloys. Boron does not oxidize nearly
so rapidly and its melting point is un-
usually high; however, it is too hard
and brittle and thus finds its chief uses
as a deoxidizer, as a component of
abrasives, and, to a slight extent, as an
alloying element. Silicon, titanium
and vanadium are rather difficult to
obtain in a pure state and lack useful
ductility but they do find important
and rather wide use as alloying ele-
ments. Similarly chromium and manga-
nese find their chief metallic use as al-
loying elements.
It is commonly known that the ele-
ments: magnesium, aluminum, and
iron are very useful as metals as well
as serving as bases for many very use-
ful alloy compositions. Beryllium is a
new comer and has only begun to play
its role in industry.
In considering the densities of the
metals—the actual weight per unit vol-
ume which is an important engineering
property—it is immediately noted that,
while the table lists these metals in
order of increasing atomic weights, the
densities of the metals are out of order,
seeming illogically so. However, all
metals (and alloys) are crystalline in
nature. This simply means that their
atoms are arranged in regular geomet-
rical patterns called "lattices". Among
the metals (and alloys) these lattices
differ in pattern, or design, as well as
in dimensions. So, regardless of atomic
weight, a cubic centimeter may con-
tain more atoms of one metal than of
another. Thus beryllium, with an
atomic weight a little more than one
third of that of magnesium, is actual-
ly, as a solid piece of metal, heavier
(that is, more dense) than magnesium.
Now we see that the light metals,
so important to the industry of today
and tomorrow, are the elements mag-
nesium, beryllium, and aluminum, in
the order of their increasing densities.
However, for the present at least,
beryllium as a pure metal is not yet
economically available and it appears to
lack, in the pure state, sufficient duct-
ility for general fabrication use. The
future may witness some alteration in
this status. Thus the light weight
champions are magnesium and alumi-
num, magnesium being l/j lighter than
aluminum.
THE LIGHT WEIGHT ALLOYS
The alloys of the light weight metals,
(magnesium ,aluminum, and beryl-
lium) will be dealt with herein only
briefly and qualitatively. New com-
positions and new heat-treaments are
being developed. In fact, some of these
developments have already been com-
pleted but cannot be disclosed until af-
ter this present war is over.
MAGNESIUM ALLOYS—
In general the strongest magnesium
alloys, in any given class, are only
slightly less strong than the correspond-
ing aluminum-base alloys. Quite re-
cently, the comparative disadvantage of
the lower corrosion resistance has been
largely overcome by producing magne-
sium metal of higher purity. Satisfac-
tory coating methods also give adequate
protection against corrosion. Although
magnesium has a field of its own, it is
today, more than ever, a real competi-
tor of aluminum. This is fortunately
so, allowing the substitution of magne-
sium for aluminum in many applica-
tions so that an evergrowing production
of aluminum can be so largely concen-
trated in the structural building of our
tremendous airplane program. The
economies of magnesium and the con-
stantly developing fabrication methods
for this metal may, in time, allow it,
too, to enter this field.
Practically all of the industrial al-
loys of magnesium vary only in their
relative contents of the alloying metals:
aluminum, manganese, and zinc, with
90 per cent (or more) of the alloy being
magnesium. Some of the alloys are
heat-treated for maximum properties,
the others being used just as cast or
wrought. Special analysis have been
developed for sand casting, permanent
mold casting, die casting, forgings, ex-
trusions, and plate, sheet and strip.
In the first place, magnesium and its
alloys were used not only for reduction
in dead weight, but also for less inertia
because of light weight, for lower bear-
ing pressures, easier rotating balance,
for reduction centrifugal forces in rotat-
ing parts, resistance to vibration failure,
and for certain advantages in high pro-
duction fabricating methods such as die
casting.
Some of the applications are as fol-
lows: crank cases and covers, breather
caps, supercharger parts, carburetor
parts, manifolds, body parts for coal
drills, portable polishing tools and drills,
vacuum cleaner parts, light weight
bearings of low load carrying capacity,
oil pumps, airplane wheels, reciprocat-
ing parts in printing presses, rotating
parts in fans and blowers, panels, cases

PRESENTS
jake
They say the vice-president hasn't
anything to do, but we defy anyone to
produce a busier man on campus than
Bill Jacobs. Bill, besides being a vice
president of the Union and vice presi-
dent of Sigma Phi Epsilon, finds time
for many other campus activities. He
evidently likes to write, for he was
Editor-in-Chief of the Technic last
spring, and edits the Sig Ep newspaper.
He's also a member of Vulcans, senior
Engineering society, of which he is
Secretarv.

Bill Jacobs
Bill hails from Escanaba, Michigan,
the "hub of the North" (according to
Bill—we wouldn't know). He remem-
bers very little about his Escanaba
school days, except that he was teach-
er's pet in kindegarten.
Bill's favorite pastimes are sailing
and skiing. He has a sloop of the Sea
Gull class, but hasn't had a chance to
sail it much in the last couple of years
because he's spent his summers going to
school. Last summer, however, he did
get a chance to sail across Lake Erie in a
schooner, but, as he puts it, "it should
have been a power boat, for there wasn't
a breath of wind for three days."
Bill has seen more of this country
than a lot of us, having made several
fascinating trips, one through the West
in the summer of '41 with three other
fellows, and another through the Upper
Penninsula. The latter trip he made in
a '29 Pontiac with six of his chums. The
trip was unceremoniously halted by a
blown head gasket, after which the boys
encountered some exceedingly interesting
experiences, including being thrown off
private property and "kicked out of
tourist camps."
That Bill got back safely, though,
we know to be a fact, because he is
graduating in October. After gradua-
tion he intends to work in Waukegan,
Illinois, with Abbott Laboratories, a
pharmaceutical company, and expects
to get more than the average man.
campus c. o.
As you enter the office of the Naval
Commandant in North Hall, you will
be welcomed with a firm handshake and
a friendly smile. You will be asked
to sit down and state your business, for
although perfectly willing to discuss al-
most anything with you, Captain R. E.
Cassidy has a job which could keep
two men busy. You can easily under-
stand, therefore, why he cannot afford
to waste any time.
Born in Norwich, Connecticut, Cap-
tain Cassidy received an appointment
to the Naval Academy at the age of
17. Four years later, he was graduated
as a Past-midshipman, the rank which
future Naval Officers received in those
days. Two years later, he was com-
missioned an Ensign and has risen
steadily since then.
Shortly after his graduation from
the Academy, Captain Cassidy was as-
signed to the cruiser St. Louis. Upon
this ship, Captain Cassidy took what
he considers to be the most eventful
cruise of his life. It was a cruise from
the east coast down around South Ame-
rica, thru the Straits of Magellan and
back up along the west coast. The ship
anchored at a number of ports along
the way, including Rio de Janeiro,
Montevideo, Lima, and Santiago. He
remained on this ship for only one year,
and from that time until the time of
World War I he served on several de-
stroyers and torpedo boats and for a
short time as Chief Engineering Officer
of the battleship West Virginia.
During World War I he served in a
most important role. As Gunnery of-
ficer of the cruiser North Carolina,
it was his job to see that the ship was
highly efficient at its most important
function—fighting. They spent most
of their time escorting troopships to
France, but the captain was sad to say
that they encountered very few of the
Jerries and he consequently missed most
of the action.

Following World War I, until 1935,
he served in a number of positions as
Navigator, Gunnery Officer, Executive
Officer, or Commanding Officer on a
number of different ships. In 1935, he
was made commander of a destroyer
squadron and served in this capacity
for a period of four years. In 1939,
the captain was appointed commander
of the South China Patrol.
Although he has spent most of his
time at sea, the captain has also served
at a number of posts all over the
country, including the Naval Academy,
Portsmouth Navy Yard, Boston Navy
Yard, and the New Orleans Naval
Station.
In 1941, Captain Cassidy was assign-
ed as Commandant of the Naval
R.O.T.C. here at the University, and
with the influx of Navy men in the
V-12 program this summer, he was
made Commandant of all Navy person-
nel on campus.

According to the old proverb, every

said anything about the Michigan man
but if all indications are correct, he is
going to have his day this fall. The
no beer
Life here in Ann Arbor has been pro-
ceeding in its usual hum-drum manner
with the topics of student conversation
ranging (in order of decreasing impor-
tance) from the war, women and the
beer shortage all the way down to Ann
Arbor weather and final exams. On
second thought, the beer situation seems
to be the most alarming. The owners
of the local grog shops have recently
resorted to banker's hours or other
hideous devices such as "beer served
only with dinners." The net result of
these unfair practices is easily noticed
on the sad, drawn faces of the students
and service men.

Even when the Liberty Street Study
Hall is open, the method of obtaining
anything worth while is long and ardu-
ous. If you are fortunate enough to
sit with a girl (from Ypsi) you might
get the waiter's attention. However,
Jacking that, you follow this procedure:
Struggle through the crowd (this is
Saturday night) to the end of the line
at the bar. This puts you about op-
posite the telephone booths. While
you stand there, a line forms behind
you consisting mainly of people who
want to use the telephone, and you are
urged to step in and get it over so that
others may have a chance. The line
moves slowly onward as inebriates slop
brew all over you and suddenly you
find yourself at the head of the line. As
you try to remember why you've been
standing in line, a waiter steps in ahead
of you and says "twenty-five." This
takes time. In twenty minutes, you
again have a chance to voice your de-
sires, but the loudspeaker interrupts
you with, "No more beer for fifteen
minutes." Desperately, you grab two off
the waiter's tray, drop a coin in the va-
cated space, and then drop both glasses
on the floor. The amusing thing is that
when the time is up and beer flows
like water, you find yourself again
leading the line to the telephone booth.
The obvious conclusion is that it's all
the telephone company's fault. Why
doesn't the administration do some-
thing about those damn public utili-
ties?
Speaking of the Army, here is some-
thing overheard at the Army mess in
the Union:
Sergeant: "Just between the two of
us, Lieutenant, you should remember to
pull the blinds down in your quarters.
When I passed last night, I saw you
making love to your wife."
Lieutenant: "Haw, that's one on
you! I wasn't home last night!"

The Navy boys have always claimed
to be rather large operators and the
latest from the good ship U. S. S. West
Quad seems to substantiate that claim.
Navy Joe had broken with his girl
friend. After ignoring several letters
requesting the return of her photo-
graph, one came threatening to com-
plain to the captain. His brain sud-
denly became filled with smooth phrases
describing the scenic beauty of Great
Lakes Naval Training Station, but our
bell bottomed lad summoned all his
courage and rose to the occasion. De-
ciding to squelch her for all time, he
borrowed all the pictures of girls avail-
able on the "ship," sending them to her
in a large bundle with the following
note:
"Pick yours out and send the rest
back, I've forgotten what you look like."

latest available figures indicate that ap-
proximately ISO men and 800 women
will enter the university this fall as
freshmen. As far as the men are con-
cerned, the number of incoming fresh-
men will not even cover the men lost
by graduation and with the number of
service men staying about the same,
there will be fewer men on the campus
than in the past. Now comes the punch
line. A detachment of WAC's will re-
place many of the men in the Army
Headquarters. Yes, this fall ,the Mich-
igan man should have his day. This
seems to be the opportune time for
some bright young lad to organize an

There is joy in the Technic office?
these days. This university is known
for a high degree of excellence in its
educational processes. Thus the Tech-
nic, being an official publication (Dean
Crawford reluctantly admitted it when
he saw the brass knuckles and rubber
hose), is pretty well concerned with
those influences which tend to disrupt
the concentration of the students. When
an influence such as this is eliminated,
we feel pleased no end. One of the
worst influences—one which has no
place on any college campus, not even
State—has been eliminated, possibly
because of the war. We repeat: there
is joy in the Technic offices, the Gar-

Norman C. Appold
Among the outstanding service alumni
of the University of Michigan, is Major
Norman C. Appold, 26-year-old De-
troiter, who is a bomber pilot serving in
the Middle East. He has been com-
mended for several deeds, about which
his parents knew nothing until reading
about them in the newspapers.
He was recently awarded the Dis-
tinguished Service Cross, highest of all
strictly Army awards, for his "magnif-
icent example of heroism" in a raid on
the Rumanian Oil fields in Ploesti.
After returning from this raid, Norman
commented, "It was the darndest thing

ners on the house tops were shooting at
us."
Previous to this he was the recipient
of the Air Medal and the Distinguished
Flying Cross with the Oak Leaf Cluster.
His many exploits included a surprise
mission on enemy bases in the Mediter-
ranean. The men were told that it was
a suicide mission, but every man came
back alive, under Major Appold's leader-
ship.
In the surprise attack, the three
American bombers, flying at virtually
"zero altitude" and facing heavy fighter
opposition, attacked the Italian chemical
works at Messina; and ferry terminals
at San Giovanni and Crotone.
"We came out of the darkness just
over the tops of the buildings," Appold
related in the dispatch. "It was a com-
plete surprise and the enemy had only
time to throw light stuff at us before we
salvoed our load in the center of the
targets and soared away. The explosions
were terrific."
Other accounts include forced land-
ings at night in the desert without
mishap; and the shooting to pieces of
his bomber by a Messerschmidt 109. His
combat flying hours add to 250.
Major Appold received his Bachelor
of Science Degree in Chemical Engineer-
ing from the University of Michigan in
1940, and his Master of Science Degree
in 1941. Previous to his attendance
here, he studied at Valparaiso University
for two years. While in school here at
Ann Arbor, he was a member of the
Michigan National Guard Air Corps.
A. I. Ch. E.
At a recent meeting of the A.I.Ch.E.,
the following officers were elected:
President, Raymond E. Tate; First
Vice President, Kenneth J. Taylor;
Second Vice-President, Laurence G.
Wayne; Secretary, Robert M. Lang;
Treasurer, Jack R. Elenbaas; Engi-
neering Council Representative,
Following the business meeting, Dr.
R. R. White, of the Chemical Engineer-
ing Department, gave an interesting
and worthwhile talk on patents. Dr.
White defined a patent as a manifest
securing to an inventor, for a term of
17 years, the exclusive right to make,
use, and vend his invention. He then
highlighted the procedure by which a
patent may be obtained. In connection
with this procedure, Dr. White pointed
out that the invention be absolutely
original; that is, it may not appear in
any written matter anywhere in the
world prior to your claim. Second, the
invention must be practical, novel, or
an improvement on some previous ap-
paratus. The United States Patent Of-
fice is the investigator and authority in
securing a patent. After the patent
office is satisfied that the submitted de-
tails are valid in every respect, then,
and only then, will they issue a patent
on the invention. Dr. White also
pointed out that in case a question as
to what is meant by parts of the pa-
tent—the authority of defining this
term in question is left entirely to the
patentee. This point is one which cause
some controversy in patent litigations;
therefore, it is essential to have patent
lawyers write the patent specifications.
Dr. White cited some of his experi-
ences in dealing with patent procedure
and patent litigations which proved
quite interesting. He emphasized in
way of closing that regardless of how
intricate patent procedure apparently
are, that it is still a major stimulant to
both public and private enterprise.
The A.I.Ch.E. takes this opportun-
ity to cordially invite all the chemi-
cal engineers to regularly attend the
meetings. The A.I.Ch.E. is your pro-
fessional society. It is the society
that determines many of the standards
to be used in the chemical industry.
The American Institute of Chemical
Engineers presents the A. McLaren
White award, which is available to you
as chemical engineering students. At
present, the Institute is very active in
the promotion of defense measures as
regard to the chemical industry. The
A.I.Ch.E. accredits chemical engineer-
ing education. You as Michigan chem-
ical engineering students should be very
active inasmuch as the first Student
Chapter of the American Institute of
Chemical Engineers was founded here
at the U. of M. in 1922 and has been
an active organization in the promo-
tion and betterment of Chemical En-
gineering. This is your opportunity to
meet both your fellow engineers and the
important men in the engineering field.
A. S. M. E.
Although not as active as in former
years, the A.S.M.E. has held several
meetings this summer in which service
men as well as civilians have taken an
active part. In fact, the President of
the organization, Hugh D. Miller, is a
member of the Marine Corps unit sta-
tioned in the West Quadrangle. We
have been unable to hold a meeting
every two weeks as in previous years,
but we have managed to have four ex-
cellent meetings to date. At the first
meeting of the semester, to which every-
one was invited, pictures were shown
of the Notre Dame game last fall. Need-
less to say, the crowd, composed of
"Lit" students as well as engineers,
overflowed the room.
Since then, we have had three excel-
lent speakers; President E. J. Abbott of
the Physical Research Company, Prof-
essor E. T. Vincent of the Mechanical
Eingineering Department, and Cap-
tain S. T. Hoffman of the Marine
Corps. Captain Hoffman spoke at our
last meeting on "The Engineer in the
Armed Forces." Captain Hoffman is a
graduate of the engineering school here
at the University and with the experi-
ence he has gained through his service
in the Marines he proved to be a very
capable speaker.
At our next and last meeting for the
semester, we will have a movie on a
manufacturing process and plenty of
refreshments for everyone. So come on
you service men, we invite you to take
part. There will also be an election of
officers for the coming school year, a
project on which the nominating com-
mittee is now working.

economies of magnesium and the con-
stantly developing fabrication methods
for this metal may, in time, allow it,
too, to enter this field.
Practically all of the industrial al-
loys of magnesium vary only in their
relative contents of the alloying metals:
aluminum, manganese, and zinc, with
90 per cent (or more) of the alloy being
magnesium. Some of the alloys are
heat-treated for maximum properties,
the others being used just as cast or
wrought. Special analysis have been
developed for sand casting, permanent
mold casting, die casting, forgings, ex-
trusions, and plate, sheet and strip.
In the first place, magnesium and its
alloys were used not only for reduction
in dead weight, but also for less inertia
because of light weight, for lower bear-
ing pressures, easier rotating balance,
for reduction centrifugal forces in rotat-
ing parts, resistance to vibration failure,
and for certain advantages in high pro-
duction fabricating methods such as die
casting.
Some of the applications are as fol-
lows: crank cases and covers, breather
caps, supercharger parts, carburetor
parts, manifolds, body parts for coal
drills, portable polishing tools and drills,
vacuum cleaner parts, light weight
bearings of low load carrying capacity,
oil pumps, airplane wheels, reciprocat-
ing parts in printing presses, rotating
parts in fans and blowers, panels, cases
and fittings for portable instruments,
bus doors, frames for fish nets, parts
for grinders and sanders, light struc-
tural framework, fuel tanks, housings,
furniture, trimmings, and small die cast
parts such has door handles, etc. The
largest single use of magnesium, until
recently, was as an alloying element
in aluminum Alloys.
ALUMINUM ALLOYS—
While magnesium entered American
industry in 1916, when imports from
Germany could no longer be obtained,
aluminum and its alloys have an older
and wider application history in this
country. In the earlier years of the
Middle Alloy Age, the light weight,
strength, corrosion resistance of uncoat-
ed stock, and easier alloying and pre-
fabricating properties of aluminum led
to its rapid application in industry.
The industrial alloys of aluminum
have a wide variety of compositions in-
cluding copper, silicon, manganese.
magnesium, zinc, nickel, chromium,
iron, and even lead and bismuth (in one
wrought alloy). Aluminum usually
constitutes 90% or more of its alloy
compositions. From these ingredients,
in various proportions, has been devel-
oped a wide range of special composi-
tions for sand casting, permanent mold
casting, die casting, extruding, forging,
and cold rolling and drawing of sheet,
strip, rod, and wire. Some of these are
heat-treated for maximum properties.
The tensile strength properties range
from those of unheat-treated casting
compositions to those of heat-treated
wrought alloys, the tensile properties of
the latter being equivalent to those of
mild steel (but with about % of the
weight).
Given such properties it is not sur-
prising that aluminum alloys developed
into such a wide range of applications:
from cooking pots and pans to pistons
for internal combustion motors and
supercharger impellers. Nor is it, there-
fore, surprising that the general public
feels well acquainted with aluminum.
BERYLLIUM ALLOYS—
Beryllium, the baby of the light metal
trio, was in experimental production
about 1930. It has been shown that,
although this metal is the lightest of
the three in atomic weight, by density
it is actually "heavier" than magnesium.
So far, aside from it prohibitive cost as
a pure metal its ductility appears to be
so limited that it is doubtful that this
metal will ever find wide use in indus-
try as wrought material. It is finding
a little use for small special applications
such as windows in X-ray apparatus.
Binary alloys with aluminum, ranging
from 30 to 70% of beryllium, have
been studied and show some advantages
in strength, stiffness and weight over
the standard wrought alloys of alumi-
num. However, as yet, these alloys
cannot be produced successfully outside
the laboratory. Some means must be
found to lower their inherent cost.
Beryllium, however, is most import-
ant to the war effort as an alloying ele-
ment in the following copper-base al-
loys: (1) 1.75-2.25% Be + 0.5% Co
(or NT) (2) 0.2-0.4% Be 4- 1.3-2.6%
Co, (3) 0.2% Be + 1.3% Ni, and (4)
0.1% Be + 0.4% Cr. These alloys have
strengths varying up to that of heat-
treated spring steel and electrical con-
ductivities up to 75 per cent of that of
pure copper, covering a wide range of
critical war applications as well as eace
time uses. The nickel-base alloys of
beryllium have promising special prop-
erties and await post-war development.
WHAT OF THE FUTURE?
The modern miracle of production is
the tremendously increased output of
magnesium and aluminum with at-
tendant lower costs. To the engineering
requirement of large capacity of water-
power generated electricity and the
transportation cost factor re'ative to
raw materials has been added the na-
tional defense factor of strategical loca-
tion of wide spread plants. Huge re-
sources of raw material are available
to the production of both metals. Al-
though a low grade material, even com-
mon clay contains aluminum and may
ultimately become a useful source. To-
day magnesium is extracted from sea
water and one cubic mile of sea water
contains about 4% million tons of this
metal; enough to furnish the present
production of 600 million lbs. per year
for 15 years!
Such tremendous increases in produc-
tion have already stimulated research
for new alloys and new heat-treatments
to yield marvelous engineering devel-
opments in the future. When the war
is concluded and these great production
capacities are returned to civilian
peace time uses, the future will see a
new light metal engineering era.
The automobile of the immediate
future cannot even be visualized by to-
day's public. Bodies, and even the
chassis, of light metal wrought alloys
may cost a little more in the price of a
new car but the savings in gasoline
mileage and tire life will be most sur-
prising. Car weights may be reduced
by as much as 50 per cent or more.
Even engine blocks may be mode from
cast iron containing up to 25 per cent
of aluminum as an alloy element or the
cast iron may be replaced by aluminum
alloy with steel liners. Radical and
pleasing new body designs will come to
pass. The automobile of the future may
not require a tow-car to put it from the
ditch or from mud and soft snow. Dull
metal finishes may eliminate the neces-
sity of paint as rust protection. With
paint used only for appearances, there
will be no quick rusting when the paint
is worn or scraped through. Reshaping
of fender and body dents will be more
easily accomplished, probably while
the customer waits.
Transportation will enter* a previous-
ly unforseen aerial area. Ocean steam-
ships will probably be used, ultimately.

Who is
Or who is about to . . .
What we folks at home are trying to do about
postwar may seem sometimes remote and
obscure. You haven't had much chance to get
acquainted with peacetime industry, and to
see it in its true role as a creative job-maker.
Take our own business, Alcoa Aluminum.
You know about the tremendous expan-
sion in aluminum capacity. You see most of
this seven-fold production going into the
planes you are going to fly, the planes that
will be your cover on the attack.
But Aluminum's true role is no more mili-
tary than yours is. Both of us do have an
immediate job to do; and then, the future—
Ever stop to think how many things in this
old world are crying to be made lighter? Or
how many ingenious, imaginative young men
are going to be needed to apply and sell and
manufacture the more than two billion
pounds of aluminum that will be available
every year when this thing is over?
Actually, we see the possibility of a mil-
lion jobs, doing something with aluminum
in peacetime, a million new jobs that did
not exist before this war. There are grand
careers ahead in aluminum!
We are devoting our eighth day of think-
ing time to doing what we can to make those
careers as certain as anything can be. We call
it Imagineering: letting the imagination
search the realm of new products and
new applications, and then engineering the
dreams, the hunches, the markets, into clear
paths to follow, someday.
Perhaps one of those paths will be yours
to follow in the future.

If the above 1470 ft. pounds of tor-
que is compensated by the Sikorsky ar-
rangement with a vertically mounted
propeller at the rear of the ship, the
static thrust required by the propeller
is quite large. If the moment arm from
the rotor drive shaft to the rear propel-
ler is 20 ft., then (1470 / 20 = 73.S).
73.S pounds of static thrust must be
developed. This, in effect, requires
that a force of 73.5 pounds must be
furnished by the propeller mounted at
the rear of the fuselage to neutralize the
effect of torque. Sikorsky claims that
about 10% of the total power is used
to offset the torque in his ship. The
Sikorsky method of torque-compensa-
tion for mechanically driven rotors is
the most efficient method devised to
date.
There are numerous other ways of
taking care of the torque problem such
as two rotors mounted co-axially and
rotated in opposite directions. The
German machine with two laterally dis-
placed rotors off-set each other's tor-
que as previously mentioned. In the
above two cases, however, the aero-
dynamic efficiencies are notoriously
poor. It is even possible to locate a
large gyroscope in the fuselage with the
gyroscopic mass rotating in a vertical
plane to compensate for the torque. The
gyroscopic method is usually prohibi-
tive due to the excessive weight and
power required to drive the gyroscope.
It is quite desirable, however, to get
the torque-compensating mechanism,
whatever it may be, out of the airstream
for in the Sikorsky method considerable
drag is added to the machine by the
rear propeller.
Probably the greatest achievement in
regard to the torque problem has been
made by Prof. E. A. Stalker, formerly
chairman of the Department of Aero-
nautical Engineering at the University
of Michigan, in preventing the genera-
tion of fuselage torque by propelling the
rotor with air jet reactions. The engine
in the Stalker helicopter drives a blower,
instead of the rotor, which supplies air
under high pressure to ducts in the
rotor blades. The air is expelled
through slots located near the trailing
edge of the blades and due to the re-
actions of the jets the blades are pro-
pelled. Since there is no direct me-
chanical connection between the fuse-
lage and rotor no torque is generated.
It is understood that the aerodynamic
efficiencies of the Stalker helicopter are
quite high and it is favorably adapted
to aircraft in the medium weight range.
The experimental helicopter which
Karl Schakel and the author designed
and built in Ann Arbor, consisted of a
single 30 ft. diameter rotor mounted
near the longitudinal center of gravity
of the craft and a tail assembly similar
to the Sikorsky type. The machine ac-
comodates the pilot and one passenger
with a gross weight of 1450 pounds. The
rear propeller, used to overcome rotor
torque, is 68" in diameter with a con-
trollable pitch range of 14 degrees. The
engine used is an aircooled 113 Hp.
Franklin. Adequate air-cooling was
accomplished by mounting an axial
flow fan on the drive shaft. The air-
foil used on the rotor blades is a 0012
NACA airfoil. A symmetrical section is
used due to its property of having a
constant center of pressure for a large
range of angles of attack. The blade
is built up on a single streamline chrom-
moly steel spar with wood ribs, plywood
leading and trailing edge, and fabric
covered. There is a uniform taper in
planform from 20" chord at the root to
9" chord at the tip, and 7 degrees twist.
The combination of planform taper and
twist give a spanwise load distribution
proportional to the centrifugal force
curve which in turn prevents high bend-
ing loads due to the lift forces.
The roots of the blades are pinned to
provide flapping motion and freedom
in the drag direction. At the drag link
a hydraulic unit is incorporated for
vibration damping. Cyclic pitch con-
trol is used and the control unit is
highly simplified and compact in nature.
Due to these improvements, however,
details of the system cannot be ex-
posed.
The transmission system in our heli-
copter consisted of a V-belt drive which
reduced the engine speed 2 to 1. A hy-
poid gear box then produced a further
reduction of 4.3 to 1. Maximum rotor
velocity is then 256 revolutions per
minute corresponding to an engine
speed of 2250 revolutions per minute.
The first flight tests were made in
July and the results were quite satisfac-
tory. With the plane of the rotor 7
ft. above the ground and the rotor turn-
ing at 140 revolutions per minute, which
corresponds to 0.6 of the maximum
horsepower, approximately 2,000 pound
lift was obtained. It must be remem-

only for vacation cruises. Business
travel and critical and perishable freight
shipping will be by air. The world will
be policed by an international air force.
The average citizen in all probability
will tow his glider to the nearby airport,
unfold its wings, and hitch hike by tow
plane, simply uncoupling his glider and
dropping off at his destination. Small
safe civilian plane-mobiles, perhaps even
amphibian, may be housed in every
third garage. The future populace will
see radical applications of the "flying"
and helicopter types.
There is a wide field for the use of
low cost light metal household furnish-
ings from decorations to furniture.
Furniture designs need not be modern-
istic. Surface coatings can closely
stimulate the appearance of wood for
antique designs. This furniture will be
easy to move and the house easier to
clean. Kitchen cabinets of light metal
will capture the heart of the housewife.
Refrigerators and stoves will be made
much lighter in weight. Insects and
diseases may even be decreased by such
uses of the light metals. Household
many other applications await the ex-
panding production of magnesium and
aluminum. Other possible uses range
from light weight desks and files for
office equipment to light weight skates
and bicycles for the youngsters.
There will be two choices in the
peaceful future: (1) to lower produc-
tion to the level of pre-war civilian con-
sumption, which would inevitably in-
crease the cost per pound of the light
metals, or (2) to develop such a market
for public acceptance and demand that
even the present high production rates
may have to be expanded. In the period
of changeover, from war necessity to
civilian choice, it may even be wisest
to maintain high production of the light
metals by government subsidy.
The future of the Light Alloy Age
even now lies in the hands of half-
knowing metallurgists and engineers
and the still un-knowing public. Ameri-
ca, the free, land of the highest living
scale in the world, faces the possibility
of an unimaginable Golden Age of
peace, by means of the expanding pro-
duction of the light metals and by many
other war-born developments, but only
so long as we can develop the spiritual
in parallel with the scientific.

Landing at 110 mph.
on a cushion of oil...

How can a bomber hit the dirt at 110 mph.
without cracking up? The answer is
partly in the design of its hydraulic
landing gear. A cushion of oil, im-
prisoned between a cylinder and piston,
absorbs the shock. The only seal which
prevents escape of the oil is the pre-
cision with which piston and cylinder
fit. Achieving the necessary micro-
scopic accuracy is another of the many
ways abrasives by Carborundum are
helping to build our machines of war.
The interior surface of the landing
gear cylinder is finished with a
honing machine, as illustrated,
fitted with abrasive sticks made
by Carborundum. Similar honing
machines are helping to produce
engine cylinders, bearing races,
and thousands of other products
requiring an accurately finished
internal cylindrical surface.


The future holds many possibilities for
new uses of abrasives. When you take
your place in industry, keep Carborundum

Come October 18th, the Interfrater-
nity Council will lose its president, the
University will lose a fine fellow and
the United States Navy will gain a
capable officer when Dick Emory re-
ceives his BSE from the University.
At present Dick is stationed on the
good ship West Quad, with the NROTC
unit. For the past two months he has
labored through the five days a week
physical training and the early morning
rising—with a smile, believe it or not!
He explains that since it is his last
semester, these phases really don't
bother him at all.

Richard Emory
If his plans work out, Dick plans to
work on Radar when he is commission-
ed for it is right in line with his elec-
trical engineering training. Dick has
specialized in high frequency commun-
ications work and hopes to make this
his life work. If these immediate plans
fail to materialize, he will see action
with the fleet.
Besides serving as the IFC president,
which position he has held since last
March, Dick is also a member of Michi-
gauma and Alpha Deilta Kappa, an
electrical engineering professional fra-
ternity. He is also a member of Theta
Chi and served as president during the
spring term.
Sailing is one of his chief leisure time
activities and leisure time with Dick
is strictly out for the duration. Golf
is one of his favorite competitive sports.
As a golfer, Dick won his freshman
numerals but lacked time as a soph-
omore to follow it through. He has
also participated in most interfraternity
athletic events. He is a faithful 'M'
football fan and hopes to be around
long enough to see the Maize and Blue
bring home the Little Brown Jug.
If, on some distant day, you amateur
radio fans want to meet an interesting
fellow, you might try contacting Mr.
Emory who operates on call letters
W8-QND. This has been another of
his chief hobbies for a number of years.
He has to take care of a little mat-
ter of matrimony, plans for which have
not been definitely completed. The
big event will take place sometime in
late October after Dick receives that
well earned commission. The favored
girl is a U. of M. Tri-Delt. (Need we
say more?!)

"I have an honest face," is Karl
Reed's explanation of his being treasurer
of Engine Council last year, and of Vul-
cans, honorary engineering society, at
present. This does not, however, ex-
plain the numerous other offices he has
held during his four years on campus.
On the engineering council since his
sophomore year, Karl is now chairman
of the honor council. In his freshman
year, he was elected secretary of Phi
Eta Sigma, honorary freshman frater-
nity. As if this list were not impres-
sive enough, Karl has been elected presi-
dent of his graduating class.
Don't think for a minute, however,
that Karl's activities have been con-
fined to politics. He's no slouch at
the swimming game, either. He swam
on his high school team back in Erie,
Pa., on the team at Mercersburg Aca-
demy (Harry Holliday was a team-
mate), and won his numerals during
his freshman year at Michigan. In ad-
dition, he was a lifeguard for two sum-
mers at the Erie municipal beach.
Other hobbies include photography
(Karl has dabbled in it for several
years but would like to do some se-
rious work in it after college), and a
little number in Ann Arbor whose in-
itials, it is confided, are M.H. Karl
is a member of Trigon, of which he was
president during his sophomore and
junior years. He and his roommate,
Jim Bazley, incidentally, constitute
100% of the civilian Trigons now on
campus.
Karl started out in the chemical de-
partment, but changed to the mechani-
cal, in which he is now a student
assistant. In commenting on the En-
gineering school, he had a definite sug-
gestion to make. Karl believes that

Karl F. Reed
Engineering should and will be a five
year course, with one year devoted to
a sort of pre-Engineering course in the
Lit school. This, he explained, will
give an engineer a more liberal educa-
tion, with which he will be better equip-
ped to take his place in society.
After graduating, in October, Karl
plans to take a position with General
Electric, if his draft board doesn't beat
them to him.
Helicopter Developments
(Continued from page 24)
bered, though, that the ground effect in
helicopters is quite prominent and with
an extrapolation of the ground effect
curce to altitude, the computed per-
formance is as follows:
Rate of descent with engine failure
=15 ft. / sec.
Rate of climb = 400 ft. / min.
Absolute ceiling = 13,000 ft.
Maximum speed = 90 MPH
At the present time helicopter devel-
opment is proceeding quite rapidly in
this country. Helicopters have been
suggested for many military uses such
as artillery spotting, convoy escort and
general reconnaissance work. Helicop-
ters are now in production but due to
wartime secrecy, the exact uses to which
they will be put are not known.
After the war, the helicopter should
occupy a prominent position in aviation.
While not well suited for the task of
carrying large loads at high speeds, the
helicopter should be very popular with
the sportsman pilot because of its easy
control and safe operation.

Christened. with FLAME!
FLAME . . . as'well as champagne christens ships. The last
act that frees a ship from the ways is the cutting of steel
bonds by oxy-acetylene flame. This swift cutting of steel typ-
ifies the way the oxy-acetylene flame is speeding the fabrica-
tion of ships, aircraft, locomotives, guns, shells, tanks, and
hundreds of other vital articles made of metal.
All over America, this flame Cuts time and gives to mass-
production industries a means of manufacturing faster, better,
and at lower cost. Since the white-hot oxy-acetylene flame
cuts through metal as easily as a saw through wood, it makes
steelworking as simple as carpentry! From the time steel is
made . . . until it is finally cut up for scrap and sent back to
the steel mills for a new lease on life ... oxy-acetylene flames
expedite its treating, cutting, and fabricating.
The oxy-acetylene flame is not new. Oxygen, acetylene, and
many machines and techniques for treating, cutting, and fab-
ricating metals have been made available to industry for
years by THE LllVDE AIR PRODUCTS COMPANY, a Unit of
UCC. The present wide application of Linde's peacetime re-
search and development . .. coupled with the great expansion
of Linde's oxygen-producing and engineering facilities before
the emergency arose. . . are contributing vitally to this coun-
try's mass output of the things it needs. These products and
processes—plus new ones that are stemming from today's
continuing research — are important among the mass-produc-
tion tools that can be used in the future to bring you better
cars, trucks, tractors, washing machines, refrigerators, and
many other things for better living at lower cost.

LIQUID OXYOENI The ,1.
mand for oxygen today is
great. Driox liquid oxygen
has made it possible for mass-
production industries to be
supplied in bulk. Liquid oxy-
gen—occupying only L/862 of
the volume of gaseous oxygen
— is shipped in tank cars and
tank trucks and converted to
gaseous oxygen as needed.

THE TALE OF A TICKET
Y\ 7*HEN the student football
* * tickets were distributed for
the Western Michigan and Notre
Dame games, a bomb which had been
quietly hissing and sputtering for
the past several years finally ex-
ploded. There has always been a
certain amount of student discon-
tent because of the method of dis-
tributing tickets, but it was never
so widespread or vigorous as now.
Many students, especially the upper-
classman, had entertained hopes of
good seats somewhere between the
thirty yard stripes. These hopes,
although well founded in the light
of past seasons, were smashed when
Seniors received pasteboards in Sec-
tion 25, 20 to 30 yard lines, with the
rest of the civilian students closer
to the goal line in the order of their
respective classes. If one is to as-
sume that varsity football at Michi-
gan is still a student affair, played
by the students primarily for the
students, it might seem that one of
the most important parts of the au-
dience, namely the student body,
had received a rather raw deal.
Also, as if to add further to the
grousing and griping, the "No Guest"
rule again reared its ugly head. This
plan, begun last year, makes it im-
possible for a student to purchase
tickets adjacent to his own in the
student section. Thus, if the Michi-
gan man invites his family or home-
town date up to the game he either
sits by himself in the cheering sec-
tion or forks over an additional $2.75
and nonchalantly throws his student
ticket out the window. This seems
a rather high price to pay for the
privilege of sitting with one's fam-
ily or friends when the net result is
just one more empty seat in the
stadium; a seat, incidentally, for
which some ardent football fan might
easily give his right arm.
The preceeding arguments seem
quite well founded but as usual',
there are two sides to the story. Mr.
Baker, temporary ticket manager
provides the other. Mr. Baker pa-
tiently explained the Athletic De-
partment's policy in this matter. The
Athletic Department is faced with
the problem of providing tickets for
all who wish to see the home games.
The sale of single game admissions
to the general public is a simple mat-
ter, but the distribution of tickets
to various groups considerably com-
plicates the whole picture. These
various groups, bondholders, Re-
gents, football team, M club mem-
bers, state legislators, administra-
tive officials of the university,
faculty, students, and the season
ticket buyers all want good seats in
the stadium and a decision as to their
relative importance must be made
before the choice seats can be as-
signed. Each bondholder is guaran-
teed by contract that as long as his
bond is outstanding, he shall have a
seat between the 30 yard lines. These
seats, however, are usually very near
the fifty yard line. The Athletic De-
partment then divides the rest of the
good tickets into 3 general classi-
fications. The best seats go to the
football team, M Club, Regents,
state legislators, and administrative
officials of the university. 'The next
block of tickets are reserved for sea-
son ticket purchasers. Finally the
remaining tickets are allocated to
the students and the faculty. The
order of these various groups should
be closely examined. Certainly the
football team and the M Club de-
serve the very best. The prestige
of the Regents and the administra-
tive officials and the purse string
control of the legislature obviously
cannot be neglected. There is, how-
ever, no reason on God's green earth
why the season ticket buyers should
get better seats than the students.
After all, football is a student affair
and if the general public can push
the student body into the end zone
by merely buying season tickets, the
Athletic Department's system is bad-
ly in need of repair.
Mr. Baker explained further that
the "No Guest'' plan had been in-
stituted at the request of several
student organizations which felt that
the deplorable condition of Michigan
cheering could be corrected by hav-
ing all the students sit together. This
argument appears quite logical but
most of us have failed to notice any
improvement in cheering sufficient to
justify separating a student from his
family or friends. Concerted stu-
dent action should be taken to
eliminate the "No Guest" rule.

The effect of fillet radius on the life of machine
parts operating under alternating stress has been
known for a long time. The knowledge has been
put to good use in designing parts so as to avoid
fatigue failures.
The effect of variation in the notch radius
of Izod impact bars has shown the way to-
wards the elimination of impact failures in
filleted parts.
Two sets of standard size impact bars were

machined from one heat of steel, both with a 45°
notch. In one set the notch radius was 0.01 inch
and in the other 0.05 inch. After quenching, and
in some cases tempering, the bars with O.05 inch
radius consistently showed about 140% improve-
ment in impact strength.
The practical application of these results, which
consisted of increasing the existing fillet radius,
has eliminated impact failures in a part where the
problem had become serious.

... New fields of precision weighing
have been opened to the blind by the
development of an "audio" scale. If the
scale shows under the correct weight,
the scale sounds an audible signal "A";
if it registers over, the signal "N" is
given. Correct weight is signalled by an
unbroken buzz tone.
. .. Magnesium, which would otherwise
be ignited in welding processes, may
now be welded in an electric arc process
with a current of helium impinging on
the welded parts.
... Of 2000 varieties of plants tested
for rubber, Russian dandelion seems to
be the most promising.
... There is a balance so sensitive that
it can weigh a single layer of oxygen
atoms on a sliver of steel the size of a
safety razor blade.
. . . Instead of fanning out in all direc-
tions, as do ordinary radio waves, radar
beams, traveling at the speed of light,
can be aimed at definite, predetermined
places.

... Each wall of our post war home
will show several different designs. Pat-
terns invisible under ordinary light will
become apparent under ultra-violet il-
lumination. The various color schemes
will be produced by the flick of a fluo-
rescent light switch.
. . . Post war automobiles will be using
a gasoline which will give them 40 miles
to the gallon. In addition to the ad-
vantage of increased mileage, this gaso-
line will be cheaper than ordinary gaso-
line. The contents of this super-fuel are
now tied up in the following wartime
uses: production of basic ingredients for
100 octane aviation gasoline, production
of synthetic rubber, and the production
of Tri-nitro-toluol, the TNT that goes
into high explosive shells.
. .. There has recently been invented a
new way of locating pieces of metal in
a person's body. It only requires a few
minutes, as compared with the old
method of using X-rays and probes,
which often requires an hour or more.
The new instrument was used for the
first time at Pearl Harbor, and on the
morning of the attack was used success-
fully in locating fragments in twenty
cases.
The finder consists of a radio fre-
quency circuit mounted in a box, with a
movable coil attached by wire and en-
closed in a small finger. The finger,
about one foot long and half an inch in
diameter, is water tight and the wire to
which it is connected is covered with
rubber so they may be detached and
sterilized.
The indicator is passed above and
around the fragment in two planes at
right angles to each other. At the points
of greatest deflection, marks are made
on the flesh, and when projected, their
intersection indicates the location of

1. This engine's crankshaft can't keep
a guilty secret. Its makers have a
complete record of its history, partly
in the form of a disc "clipped" from
the shaft's end. They divide this disc,
known as a coupon, into three pieces.
One receives hardness and microscopic
tests. The center piece is tested for
tensile strength. The third is kept
on file. To "clip" these coupons with
minimum waste, maximum speed, and
without heating the metal, abrasive
cutting off wheels are employed.
2. With speed and precision
counting for so much these days,
abrasive cutting off wheels by
Carborundum are coming into far
wider use. In seconds they per-
form jobs which require minutes
by ordinary methods. Such
wheels are now used to cut plas-
tics, glass, brick, tile, steel
and non-ferrous metals in plate
and bar stock faster and more
accurately than they were ever
cut before.

abrasive applications that may be
strange to you. When and if you
do, remember that Carborundum is

essary, the finger can be introduced into
the wound, even the lung, brain, or ab-
domen.
. . . There has been reported a new
coating for metal products, which is es-
sentially an alkali alumina silicate hav-
ing high thixotropic properties. Th?
metal must first be cleaned (by ordi-
nary methods); then the coating may
be applied by either spraying or dip-
ping. Heating to 750 -800° F accom-
plishes the combination of the ingredi-
ents of the coating into a hard heat re-
sistant finish, insoluble in boiling water
and resistant to most acids and alkalies.
... Another new product which has
just been placed on the market is a
soldering flux which breaks down lead-
rich solders into a free flowing fluid.
Low tin content solders may be sold-
ered with this product; and it produces
joints of higher tensile strength than
heretofore obtained with 50-50 solders.
... An adjustable speed electronic
motor drive, which has be:n announced
recently, is reported to be available for
operations which require constant preset
speed at varying loads over a 20:1
speed range and a smooth automatic ac-
celerator and decelerator.

specimens. The particles of this gamma
alumina powder are so small that they
are visible only under the electron mi-
croscope. The powder, which has a pH
of about 7, is highly washed and will
polish both hard and soft material.

... The airplane's first flight could
have been made within the wing-span
of a modern bomber.
. . . Since 1914, the chemical industry-
has produced more than 200,000 prod-
ucts previously unknown to man.
... To aid the rescue of fliers forced
down at sea, there has been designed a
tiny searchlight, only as big as a walnut
yet so powerful that it will project a
1SOO candlepower beam for 60 nauti-
cal miles. It is the most powerful beam
ever obtained from such a small incan-
descent unit. The lamps, which fit in a
band around the head, are worn by
each man of a plane crew forced down
at sea.
. .. Some day we may be able to stop
worrying about getting our fingers
caught in electric fans. Research men
say that "there is a very definite pos-
sibility" of a fan with no blades, no
moving parts, but with the air kicked
along with electrical charges.
. . . Also we may be able to stop strug-
gling with stubborn ice cube trays.
There has been designed, one with cor-
rugated sides made of two metals of un-
equal contraction; so that, as the cubes
freeze, the corrugated walls straighten
out and draw away from them, and the
bottom pops them loose.
... On a modern battleship, there are
as many as 1000 applications of plastic.

as a road building material. In an effort
to resist the surface scaling caused by

chloride, orvus (sometimes referred to
as soap) was mixed with sand. Results
from the test showed that the use of

NGOTS GO TO WAR!
THE HARRISBURO STEEL CORPORATION produces thousands of tons of
carbon and alloy steel each year, practically all of which is now
used in the manufacture of materials of war for the Armed
Forces of America and her Allies.
From Harrisburg's modern open-hearth furnaces, carefully
controlled heats of molten steel are carried to the pits by huge
ladles that pour it into giant molds. These molds form the
ingots of precious steel... steel that is now "going to war" but
will be used to make Harrisburg's famous Seamless and Drop-
Forged Steel Products.
To make these quality products the steel itself must be right.
That is why Harrisburg makes its own carbon, alloy and special
steels. That is why Harrisburg products are right from the
start . . . supervision begins at the open-hearth and ends only
at the point of shipment.
Today Harrisburg sends its Steel Ingots to War but when
Victory is ours these same ingots will again be used in the
manufacture of peacetime products . . . products that have
been sold in the markets of the world for over ninety years.

mental in producing a surface which is

... In order to produce the material
for each mile of an eighteen foot high-
way, a ton of dynamite is required. One
pound is needed for the production of
the metal used in only a single light-
weight 1942 automobile.
. .. The world's fastest camera, which
takes 8000 picture-units per second, has
recently been announced. It even pho-
tographs explosions caused in wires by
the flow of very heavy electrical current.
... An interesting feature in the post-
war world will be radios that practically
operate themselves. They will auto-
matically turn on when an important
news item is being broadcast. In addi-
tion, there will be an indicator on the
set which will show the type of radio
programs on available stations, whether
tuned in or not.
... Even though glider planes have no
engines and no propellers, the inside of
a glider is an extremely noisy place.
When the glider is moving at about 150
miles per hour, it is almost impossible
to carry on a conversation.
... In order to enable American
ground vehicles in battle zones to carry
on operations without danger of attack
from their own planes, rainbow smokes
are being employed. For signals be-
tween air and ground, color codes are
being used. The color sequences are
changed from day to day—in order to
confuse the enemy.
. . . Paperboard is now made so weath-
er-proof that it can be submerged twen-
ty four hours without falling apart. It
is a new material, made of four to eight
sheets of heavily sized paper laminated
together with a water soluble vinyl
resin.
. .. Recently announced is a new way
to prevent the formation of ice on pro-
peller blades of aircraft. The develop-
ment of conducting rubber makes the
new device possible. To the leading
edge of each propeller blade is attached
a strip of conductive rubber. The pas-
sage of electricity through the material
heats this edge enough to keep ice from
forming. This is an improvement over
former methods of deicing after the ice
has already been formed.
... The amount of steel used in the
manufacture of bottle caps is about
equal to the amount used, in a normal
year, in making automobile bodies.

NO, it isn't a gun or a new style bomb.
It's all we can show you of a special
glass tube that is part of our secret sub-
marine listening apparatus.
The same kind of tubes are used in
listening devices that can pick up the
menacing hum of an enemy plane miles
away. And they're made out of special
glass, to exacting requirements, by
skilled Corning workmen in the peaceful
Chemung Valley in Southern New York
State.
Did we say "peaceful"? That isn't
exactly correct. No subs actually prowl
the Chemung, but there's plenty of war-
like activity going on at Corning Glass
Works, just as in every glassworks in
the whole United States.
For Corning, like other glassmakers,
was ready to turn its skill and experience
to our country's use before the smoke
had cleared at Pearl Harbor. For ex-
ample, since World War I, Corning has
developed medical and chemical glass-
ware that frees this nation from de-
pendence on foreign imports. This ma-
terial is now flowing in a steady stream
to industry, hospitals, and laboratories.
Hundreds of other items are made by
Corning to aid the war effort. Optical
glass, insulators for planes and tanks and
ships, heavy glass parts for the manu-
facture of explosives, even glass preci-
sion gauges (ring, plug and others;).
Many of these jobs represent new uses
for glass, where glass replaces metals
because it is strong, resistant to wear
and corrosion, and fairly plentiful.'
After the war many of these uses
will stay, and new ones will be add-,
ed because glass is a material of endless
possibilities. And then, as now, Corn-
ing will be the center of American glass
research.
In your own future as an engineer,
keep your eye on glass! Corning Glass

Admiral Halsey with this example of a
mixed metaphor; "The Japs are listen-
ing," the interviewer quoted, "to the
distant rumbling handwriting on the
wall."
As the rumbling becomes plainer for
the Japs to "see," we at home stop,
when time permits, to wonder what our
new world will be like. Morally certain
that our victory is assured, we must ad-
mit that there will follow a job of re-
building shattered peoples, states, and
empires that may well dwarf the effort
involved in the war itself.
The rumbling we hear is distant and
confused. He is bold and brash who
would attempt to predict even the out-
line of the handwriting that describes
our picture after World War II, beyond
the fact that it is our determination that
wars and want shall be abolished for all
time, and that all people will enjoy
those basic freedoms for which the de-
mocracies fight.
We are, however, given to specula-
tion. Most of this speculation comes in
a prediction of our peacetime living as
it will be influenced by the technical and
industrial advances of the era just pre-
ceding and continuing through the war.
By a study of today's advertising and
by the reading of a goodly number of
magazine articles, we can visualize a
world that "in the shape of things to
come" makes H. G. Wells seem con-
servative. Little Nemo's dreams are
coming true and Buck Rogers' inter-
planetary adventures seem just around
the corner. Few of such predictions are
actually impossible of fulfillment in the
light of scientific knowledge. Few also
are the result of new discoveries. The
war has brought tremendous develop-
ment of what we knew before, but little
that is basically new.
There is a field of prediction, closer to
us and perhaps more uncertain, that
has to do with the new shapes of al-
ready familiar things. Here again, the
prophets are free with words and pic-
tures of the new home you will live in,
the car you will drive, the postwar re-
frigerator, the range, and the washer
that will grace your home. All are radi-
cally new, embodying entirely new
standards of design, performance, and
efficiency.
You could easily be led to believe that
most existing machines and tools, along
with their methods of control and use,
are to be immediately obsolete. The
science of electronics, for instance, is
by no means new—the range of its use-
fulness has been vastly broadened, and
this, although shrouded in mystery,
is expected to give us not only some-
thing radically new in radio and in tele-
vision, but also an industrial revolution
when the war is over.
Continuing along our field of specula-
tion, we are to put to sea in great liners,
which receive power by radio; we are to
leave the home roof-top in our own heli-
copter and land on our office roof or at
the first tee; our freight, outside of
heavy tonnage material, will go by air,
leaving our rails rusting; our food will
be synthetic and we may attain freedom
from cooking, and even digesting; our
lives will be spared for many extra
years, by new and magical drugs; we
will drive our ships and planes blind
through dark and fog, with never a col-
lision. The age of plastics, plywood,
and light metals is said to be upon us,
and one wonders what is to happen to
our great steel industries. So much of
this, however, while possible, is ac-
tually unpredictable. It will do no
harm, therefore, to examine the trends
which may develop after the war and
which will influence our peace-time living.
An attempt to be realistic about con-
ditions after the war releases unlimited
use of the imagination. The future un-
covers slowly and in unthought-of ways.
On December 6th, half our people did not
believe we would ever be in the war.
As I write, Italy has crumbled, and who
thought, after we had moved into North
Africa, that it would be necessary to
fight our way up every inch of the Ital-
ian boot? And now perhaps we are be-
ing too optimistic about where Germany
will make her stand. There are, though,
some facts and trends that we may as-
sume will take place, and it can't hurt to
examine them. Their effect upon our
peacetime living will be profound.
We will stay outside the realm of
theoretical economics and politics and
start with certain realistic assumptions.
First, our democratic institutions will be
preserved, tempered by governmental
controls and activity to insure an or-
dered return to a peace-time economy.
Second, a high economy and national
dollar income, as compared to "before
the war" averages, will be assured.
Some of the best economists in the coun-
try are working on these problems, both
in circles of private industry and gov-
ernment. If they succeed, we can en-
visage a peace that will be happy and
prosperous.
Our return to peace-time industry will
certainly be gradual, and accomplished
by governmental controls, which we may
hope will be lightened as rapidly as in-
dustry can take over the responsibility
for employment of our millions now in
war industry, armed forces, and heavily-
staffed bureaus and agencies.
A first phase of our return to peace-
time industry seems already to be in
sight. There are certain items of civilian
durable goods that are now desperately
wanted and needed. The industrial ma-
chine is now catching up with some of
the needs of the armed forces, both for
use and for back-log, and it will not be
long before materials and manpower will
be available to permit release, under
conditions of strict allocation, of some
of these items so badly needed by the
civilian economy.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


washers and flat-irons, seems close to
number one on the list. These, in view
of the labor shortage, are needs, not
luxuries. Refrigerators also constitute
an item of real need if food spoilage is
not to endanger our supplies and our
civilian health standards. Pressure cook-
ers and canning supplies are 'badly
needed. It would not be too surprising
to see the release, for manufacture, of
some automobiles for civilian use.
The real problem will be to satisfy
this demand with production from fac-
tories which are now almost entirely
converted to war work. It can be solved,
but we cannot look for any of the new
and fanciful ideas in this wholly pre-
liminary stage. These products will be
made from existing tools, dies, and fix-
tures. There's no time, no manpower,
and no material for new tools. We will
start in where we left off to supply a
crying need.
The second phase of our return to
peacetime industry will come with the
final armistice. This is the time we are
inclined to look to as marking a sudden
return to full peace-time production,
with new and radical advances in tech-
niques and performances, but the present
facts deny that completely.
Our factories are set for wartime
production. Many of them are making
products bearing little or no relationship
to regular business. Machines have been
moved or set aside for the duration; as-
sembly lines have been torn up; old
skills are lost; many key members of
production and distribution forces are
still in the armed services. Materials
are not on hand. The shift to war pro-
duction at today's level has taken four
full years of breathless work.
Going the other way will be an even
greater test of our industrial ingenuity
and ability. Already plans are vast and
complicated for cushioning the impact.
They include an expectancy that war
work will taper off considerably during
the last period of hostilities, allowing
some shift to civilian production, before
the "X" day we are talking about.
Then will come a steep reduction in ex-
isting war production, but not a sudden
stoppage of the wheels. It appears that
we won't go right back to sleep this
time but will maintain and continue to
arm a considerable force, particularly of
sea and air power. Next comes the need
for rehabilitation abroad which is un-
predictable, but may, in the early stages,
require considerable manufactured goods
from our plants, as well as the already
planned requirement of food from our
farms.
Sweeping construction projects, both
public and private, are even now being
formulated. These include housing com-
bined with slum clearance, roads, and
reclamation projects. A cushion of un-
employment insurance for employees of
war industries and for the returning sol-
diers and sailors is expected.
All these things are needed to permit
the orderly return to the ultimate peac?
of our dreams. The real speed of that
return will depend on how fast we can
convert to the production of the imple-
ments of peace.
The market is vast; depletion of
stocks, wearing out and obsolescence of
existing machinery, needs of new fam-
ilies, high wage levels, savings and a tre-
mendous pool of credit all point to that.
It gives earmarks of runaway inflation
that must be controlled.
We hope and expect that the present
controls by allocation of materials will
be lifted gradually, the rate of relief
from regulation depending upon the

ENGINEERING COLLEGES
by
IvanC. Crawford
Dean, College oj Engineering, University of Michigan
r"PHK blue of the Navy and the khaki
*• of (he Army have replaced to a
very large degree the civilian dress of
students in the colleges of engineering
of the United States. The immediate
future will witness the almost total dis-
appearance of civilian attire from these
newly created military and naval acad-
emies.
Why has it been necessary to make
this change? The answer as given in a
joint statement issued by the Secre-
tari.s of War and Xavy is "to main-
tain a steady flow of young men suit-
able for specialized educational techni-
cal training for the Army, Navy. Ma-
rine Corps and Coast Guard." Lower-
ing the draft age to 18 years, the nor-
mal age of entry into an engineering
school, dried up the only stream from
which the armed forces might naturally
expect a continuing supply. Hence the
necessity for establishing programs for
the selection and training of young men
at an accelerated rate in certain engi-
neering fields and other fields of direct
and immediate use to the services.
COMPARISON OF PROGRAMS
To the general public, it might ap-
pear that since the objectives are simi-
lar th? two programs should be very
much alike, if not exactly the same.
Examination of the diverse problems of
the services indicates quite clearly that
sharp differences might well exist be-
tween the methods employed to reach
the objective. Such differences are pres-
ent.
In the Army Specialized Training
Program the term is 12 weeks in length.
Students of civil engineering are al-
lotted 6 terms; electrical, chemical and
mechanical engineers, 7: sanitary engi-
neers, 8 terms. Seventy-two to ninety-
six weeks is the period of time which
the students may expect to spend in
college. This program is divided into
two phases, the basic, and the advanced
engineering. The former is three terms
in length and is common to all curricu-
lum. The advanced phase is 3, 4, or 5
terms. Recently the Army has an-
nounced a program wherein many stu-
dents are to receive three 12-week
terms of basic training and then go im-
mediately to field duty. The trainees
in this basic phase will receive some
specialization in the fields of Survey-
ing, Internal combustion engines. Com-
munication and Acoustics and Optics.
The Navy College Program sets its
term length at 16 weeks. Depending on
the type of sen-ice he is selected to fol-
low, the student may expect to remain in
college from two to eight terms. Avia-
tion cadets complete the college in the
shortest time, two terms: deck candi-
dates stay four terms: general engi-
neers, b: and engineer specialists of
whom there are five classifications. S
terms. The latter remain in college 12$
weeks, roughly, the equivalent of the
normal 4-year engineering program.

The navy does not march
Although the engineering content L-
much the same in the two programs
there are several rather important dif-
ferences. Physics is started in the firsl
term (the beginning of the Freshmar
year) in each case. This is a decide*
innovation in engineering education be
cause in the great majority of college-
the physics courses have been placed
in the sophomore year and are accom-
panied by the Calculus. Needless tc
say the new arrangement calls for a re-
adjustment of teaching procedures or
the part of the physics instructor.
Both programs devote approximate^
the same amount of time to English
History has a place in each, but UK
geography course of the Army extending
through the three basic terms has nc
counterpart in the Navy schedule. Be-
yond the freshman year, the Xavy re-
quires a two-term course in Principle
of Economics and a one-term course it
General Psychology: also, students it
this service are required to enroll il
Naval History and Elementary Strata
gy for one term. Engineer specialists a
the Navy study Contracts and Speciti
cations.
In general it may be said that th
Navy program, in so far as engineerin|
is concerned, conforms rather closely t(
the traditional four-year course. In th
Army, economics, psychology, and de
scriptive geometry axe missing, and I
considerable number of advance course
usually present are considerably com
pressed or omitted entirely.
Both programs emphasize the pod
that academic studies are to take prece
dence over military training. The Arm]
however, maintains a more strict disci
plinary control than does the Navy. Sol
dier trainees study under supervisiiS
daring the evenings and are required U
march to and from classes. Navji
trainees have one hour of instruction pa
week in military drill during the sta
dent's first term, they do not march 4
ar.d from classes, and their evening stut
ho-urs are not supervised. The Army r

THE MICHIGAN TECHN


military training in the first term is in-
cluded.
The various curricula cover subject
matter at the college level, and conse-
quently in most instances the subjects
mastered will count toward a degree.
The Army curricula do not provide time
for students to complete the work for a
degree. Therefore, it will be necessary
for them to return for a period of time
after military service. This condition
also prevails in some of the Navy cur-
ricula. However, those selected for the
specialists group in the Navy will have
time to substantially, if not entirely,
complete the work required for a bache-
lor's degree.
OBJECTIVES
In the Army program ,the objective is
to train specialists in the fields of civil,
electrical, mechanical and chemical en-
gineering who after completion of the
course will find places in the Corps of
Engineers, Signal Corps, Ordnance De-
partment, and the Chemical Warfare
Service. As officially stated, the gradu-
ates "at the termination of any phase of
specialized training under this program
will be:
(1) Selected for further training in an
officer candidate school.
(2) Recommended for a technical
non-commissioned officer.
(3) Returned to troops.
(4) In exceptional cases, detailed for
very advanced technical training.
(5) Made available, in very excep-
tional cases, for technical work
to be done out of the Army, but
deemed to be highly important to
the war effort."
The Navy objective is somewhat
broader, although less specific, and, as
stated by Rear Admiral Randall Jacobs
"its primary object is to give prospec-
tive naval officers the benefits of college
education in those areas mostly needed
by the Navy." A certain percentage of
the students will become engineering
. specialists, but a much larger group are
prepared for more general duties. Naval
authorities have expressed the desire "in
as far as possible, to preserve the nor-
mal pattern of college life."
SELECTION OF STUDENTS
Civilians for both programs are se-
lected from high school seniors, high
school graduates, and, under certain
conditions, college students not in an
armed force program. The initial hurdle
is a screen test administered in the lo-
cality in which the student lives. Suc-
cessful candidates expressing a prefer-
ence for the Army are inducted into the
service and sent to a basic military
training camp and from there go to
educational institutions as directed. The
Navy candidate after passing the screen
test is interviewed lito determine the po-
tential officer-like qualities, and is given a
physical examination." Following this
step the candidate appears before a
committee composed of two civilians and
a naval officer which makes the final se-
lection. Candidates may also be selected
directly from the enlisted men of the
armed services who have passed certain
classification tests and are recommended
by their commanding officers.
In the case of the Navy, properly
qualified enlisted reservists are also eli-
gible for transfer from their previous
status. Thus, former V-l students hav-
ing passed qualifying examinations are
admitted; also former V-7 students. A
quota of V-5 candidates, naval aviation
cadets, will also enter the V-l2 program.
SOME PROBLEMS
Although these educational programs
embrace pre-medicine, pre-dentistry, and
in addition supply corps and pre-chap-
lain training in the Navy, the great
majority of the students are in engineer-
ing or in fields closely related thereto.
Since the numbers to be trained are large
it has been necessary to locate units at
every institution of college grade pos-
sessing the necessary resources in facul-
ty, equipment and housing.
In order that the units be handled
economically it is desirable that each
unit be composed of several hundred
students from a minimum of approxi-
mately two hundred to a thousand or
more. Thus the regular personnel, com-
missioned and enlisted, required to ad-
minister the unit is kept down. Insti-
tutions must provide quarters and mess-
ing facilities. These requirements, have
been difficult to meet where the college
lacked domitories, a situation frequently
met in the case of our urban universities.
Several years ago Admiral Nimitz
called attention to the lack of mathe-
matical training among college juniors
and seniors studying for commissions at
midshipmens' schools. Both the Army
and Navy are now discovering a similar
lack of training among recent high
school graduates. Many of the entering
students, boys who have passed screen-
ing tests with good scores, have had no
mathematics in high school except busi-
ness arithmetic and consequently are
unable to carry the mathematics re-
quired of freshmen engineers.
The work-week in academic subjects
of the service student is not materially
different from that of the standard en-
gineering program of peace time. On
top of this there are several additional
hours each week devoted to physical
and military training—the later in the
Army curricula, especially. As an offset
to these additional hours, the service
men are relieved of all financial worries.
For properly prepared students the pro-
gram is not unduly exacting, although
it must be said that the trainee does not
have a large amount of spare time.
But this is as it should be. Prospective
Army and Navy officers must demon-

TO THE
By
John J. Linker, '44 E
STUDENTS and graduates of the
College of Engineering are proud of
the school's traditions, but probably
not one of these gives the college more
prestige than the honor system. The
system is sometimes ridiculed, and most
"Lit" students consider it a farce. Nev-
ertheless, the students in the College of
Engineering have supported it enthusi-
astically since its introduction. It is not
the aim of this article to preach about
the honor system but rather to familiar-
ize first semester students with the sys-
tem and maintain student support of
one of the "engine'' school's famous tra-
ditions.
By the request of the students, the
honor system was introduced to the Col-
lege of Engineering in 1915. Since that
time it has constantly grown in impor-
tance and prestige. This has been partly
due to the support of the faculty, but
even more to the wholesome attitude of
the student body. We must continue,
in spite of the war and present condi-
tions, to maintain the consciousness of
the students with reference to the sys-
tem, in order that it may continue to
operate effectively.
The principles upon which the honor
system is based are these:—Since engi-
neering is primarily an individual enter-
prise as far as design and theory are
concerned, cheating now only leads to
failure later. Also, since college stu-
dents are individuals, they can be led
more easily to uphold their honor by
their own means rather than being
herded like animals to honesty under
the influence of a worn-out proctor sys-
tem. Without a doubt it gives a person
a warm feeling toward his instructor,
when he realizes that he is mature
enough to be trusted with his own
honor.
A committee composed of democra-
tically elected men has been the judic-
iary body known as the Honor Council.
All cases involving civilians are initially
referred to this body for consideration.
Cases involving men in the Army, Navy,
or Marines are referred directly to the
ENGINEERS
faculty disciplinary committee by the
request of Army and Navy officials.
Civilian cases demanding further atten-
tion are also referred to the faculty dis-
ciplinary committee where official ac-
tion can be taken, but only after the
case has been completely reviewed by
this committee.
The Honor Council has no power
vested in itself, but, after talking with
the individuals concerned, it has the
right to make any recommendations to
the faculty committee that seem advis-
able. The recommendation may range
from an E in the course and probation
for dishonesty to expulsion from the
Engineering College on the second of-
fense. Proof of the fairness of the sys-
tem lies in the fact that ever since the
introduction of the system THE FAC-
ULTY COMMITTEE HAS NEVER
REVERSED A DECISION OF THE
HONOR COUNCIL. However, in one
or two cases they have made the pen-
alty more lenient.
It may seem at times that the Honor
Council has ceased to function, but this
is due to the fact that the activities of
the Honor Council are not publicized
in order to avoid further embarrass-
ment to those students involved. It is
not uncommon for two or three stu-
dents to be asked to leave school each
semester. Nor is it uncommon for sev-
eral students to have "probation for dis-
honesty" placed on their permanent rec-
ord in the Dean's office. By the means
of these counseling and enforcing de-
vices, the system has flourished and the
cases have been clearly handled.
It is not the purpose of the Honor
Council to find men to try, but rather
to try all those who persist in breaking
the honor code even after someone has
asked them to stop. If a person is
infringing upon the honor code, some-
one in the class should ask him to stop.
If he stops, there is no reason for tak-
ing further action. However, if he
should insist on continuing or if he does
it during subsequent tests, he doesn't
belong in this or any other engineering
school, and his name should be brought
to the attention of the Honor Council
and not the instructor, by placing a let-
ter in Engineering Council drop box
outside the Dean's office.
The system is not absolutely perfect,
for that matter no system ever was, but,
until a better system is developed, we'll
stick with the honor system. However,
it belongs to the engineers and the suc-
cess of the honor system depends en-
tirely upon the support of the students
in the College of Engineering.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Chad J. Raseman, '43 E
IT IS a rather surprising fact, in view
of the very general significance ot
catalysis in ohemical processes, that
knowledge of catalysis cannot be so
closely followed as chemical knowledge
in general. Mankind's oldest chemical
experiment, in the production of fire,
has only joined the list of catalytic re-
actions by the comparatively recent rec-
ognition of the role of water vapor in
the flame. Apart from flame, therefore,
the first catalysis to become known and
deliberately carried out were enzyme
processes, namely, wine-making and the
preparation of vinegar from alcoholic
liquids—processes in which Nature her-
self furnished the catalyst to unsuspect-
ing man. Alcoholic fermentation in par-
ticular appears quite generally and con-
temporaneously in the earliest docu-
ments of civilization, that is, in the
time of the Chinese, Assyrians, and
Egyptians, but without the latter hav-
ing perceived its nature in spite of their
otherwise good knowledge. The first
case in which we find the artificial use
of a catalyst, is the well known forma-
tion of ether from alcohol and sulfuric
acid, alleged to have been discovered by
Abu Musa Dschabir, an Arabian chem-
ist, although there is now some evidence
in the form of authenticated prescrip-
tions in favor of a later date. Here also,
however, the nature of the action was
not understood; the view was long held
that "sulphuric ether" contained sul-
phur.
The ideas of catalysis already dormant
in the dreams of the alchemists were
first awakened to practical life, how-
ever, through the origination, towards
the end of the 18th century, of exact
chemical inquiry. Then, following the
deepened insight into chemistry, the
number of catalytic reactions, known as
such, rapidly increased. In 1781, Par-
rnentier discovered the saccharification
(conversion to sugar) of starch by acids,
and eventually, in 1812, its significance
was fully understood by Kirchoff De
Saussure, in the case of the saccharifi-
cation of gluten, was the first to con-
ceive the idea of acceleration of reaction
in 1818, but he remained, as we shall
see, for a long time without adherent or
successor.
At that time also, the first investiga-
tions of surface catalysis were carried
out. In 1796, Van Marum investigated
the dehydrogenation of alcohol by met-
als. Later, in 1825, Faraday performed
the first experiments on the catalytic
synthesis of ammonia from the ele-
ments, experiments, however, which are,
not entirely equivocal.
These were the oldest and most im-
portant of a large number of separate
data, that had to be known, in order
that Berzelius might be able, about
1836, to apply his gifted touch to their
classification under a new collective idea
namely that of "Catalysis." He writes:
"As long as--, their mutual connec-
tion remains obscure, it facilitates our
inquiries, to consider it for the present
as a force in itself, just as it facilitates
our discussion of it if we have a special
name for it. I shall, therefore, call it,
to make use of a derivation well known
in chemistry, the Catalytic Force of
Bodies and the decomposition which it
produces, Catalysis."
"The catalytic force appears essen-
tially to consist in this, that bodies,
through their affinity, have the power to
awaken affinities dormant at this tem-
perature and, as a consequence of this,
the elements in a substance arrange
themselves in such other relationships as
bring about a greater electrochemical
neutralization." Some sentences follow,
in which were clearly raised the prob-
lems of what we now call selective cat-
alysis.
Catalytic research was furthered at
the end of the 19th century when the
young science of physical chemistry be-
came master of the still enigmatical
concept and brought the quantitative
method to bear in its elucidation. W.
Ostwald was successful in this respect,
in that he introduced the velocity of the
reaction as a measure of catalytic action
and formulated his classical definition of
catalysis: "A catalyst is any substance
which alters the velocity of a chemical
reaction without appearing in the end
products."
The theory, which Berzelius had
formulated empirically, was overwhelmed
in one blow by this introduction of re-
action velocity into the problem, which,
through its stated relationship to a
measurable quantity, became the object
of new and more exact inquiry. Every
investigation of catalytic phenomena,
to which we owe our more exact knowl-
edge of the present day, dates from this
moment.
It has turned out that the reserva-
tion in the Ostwald definition, that the
catalyst does not appear in the end
product and therefore does pot enter
into the equation of the reaction had to
be made more precise. Thus Bredig re-
marks: "According to this, the so-called
catalysts can remain unaltered or also
become altered themselves, but in the
latter case they are still only to be con-
sidered as catalysts, when no stoichio-
metric whole number relationship exists
between the amount of the so-called
catalyst eventually changed and the
amounts of the other substances, the so-
called substrate, that are converted."
And Abeleven goes so far as to postu-
late: "Not substances, but only reactions
are catalyzed." That this last statement
does not contradict the Ostwald defini-
tion, is evident from wljat follows. How-
ever, in this last epoch, progress has
proceeded not so much from the asser-
tion of a strict definition, once a fruit-
ful one was found, but rather in that we
have obtained the velocity relationships
of a very large number of catalyses
from an abundance of experimental
work, and have thereby obtained insight
into their mechanism.
Theory of Catalytic Reactions
A gradually increasing weight of evi-
dence as to the lack of uniformity of
the catalytic surface led H. S. Taylor to
put forward the idea of active centers,

You might think it an advantage to
have your father on the University
faculty, but as far as Judson Brown is
concerned, this is not the case. Judd's
Dad is G. G. Brown, Chairman of the
Chemical and Metallurgical Engineer-
ing Department. Judd claims he some-
times feels that being a professor's son
has its disadvantages because some of
his profs bend over backwards to make
certain they show him no favors. He
does admit though, that he has the ad-
vantage of knowing some of his instruc-
tors very well which can be helpful. As
far as students go, Judd says that
many of his friends don't know there is
any connection.

Judson Brown
As you might expect, Judd is study-
ing for a B.S.E. in chemical engineering,
and will receive his degree next Febru-
ary. As yet, he is not quite certain of
his field of concentration but he is seri-
ously considering work in the Texas pe-
troleum industry.
Judd received his secondary educa-
tion both at Cranbrook and Ann Arbor
high school. While in high school, he
developed into quite a tennis and base-
ball player and put the shot on the high
school track team.
Here at Michigan, Judd won his
freshman numerals on the swimming
team, and has spent two years since
with the team. He is a member of the
varsity Glee Club and also the Choral
Union, has been tapped by Triangles,
engineering honorary society, and is a
member of Psi Upsilon fraternity. Judd
comprises one tenth of the civilian Psi
U's now on campus.
In his leisure time, Judd does a little
sailing and photographic work. For the
past summers, he has worked as a
swimming instructor. Nice work if you
can get it!
One experience stands out in his
mind. He had the unusual privilege of
taking CM. 11, thermodynamics, from
none other than his Dad. One day,
when assigned to the board, he insisted,
despite Dad's suggestions, on following
his own reasoning on the particular
problem. However, when the smoke of
battle had cleared away and the answer
was obviously wrong. Professor Brown
came up with his epic remark, "You're
just as stubborn as your old man"!
the colonel
Yes, Colonel Rogers, commandant of
all the Army units on the Campus, is a
real Army man, having served in the
regular Army since 1909. He retired in
September 1939 after thirty years of ac-
tive duty, but was called to active duty
again in June of 1941.
Colonel Rogers spent most of his
youth near the small Wisconsin town in
which he was born. He attended the
University of Minnesota, during the
Willie Heston era of Michigan football.
He had to admit though that being sta-
tioned back here on the Michigan cam-
pus seemed like "old home week,'' for
he had served here as Professor of Mili-
tary Science and Tactics from 1933 to
1937. In addition to this, his wife re-
ceived her Master's degree from the
U. of M. Therefore, there need be no
reason to worry about his allegiance
during those titanic struggles for the
little brown jug, for the Colonel is a
loyal Michigan man.
In 1909, in order to obtain a com-
mission in the regular Army, Colonel
Rogers took a competitive academic
exam, which, in his own words, "was
worse than cramming for finals." Previ-
ous to the World War he served in the
-Mexican Punitive Expedition. It was
about that time that the Army first be-
gan to use motor vehicles. He said that
he could remember well the first trucks
that he saw in the Army. The chassis
were built by a trucking company, and
had a five ton capacity. On these, the
Army mounted one ton capacity wooden
coach bodies. With each truck, the com-
pany supplied a mechanic and driver lie-
cause the trucks were not dependable
nor did the Army have personnel capa-
ble of operating the trucks.

Colonel Rogers
Although Colonel Rogers did not
serve on the front during the last war.
he did serve as head of the services of
supply for the Army of Occupation,
with about 200,000 men under his com-
mand.
He heartily believes that the develop-
ment of character and leadership,

WHAT'S SPIRAL-4?
Closely following our advancing forces rolls a truck, with
Signal Corps men paying out telephone cable. There are
no stops for splicing—for the ends of the quarter-mile
lengths are fitted with weather-proof connectors that
snap together.
This is Spiral-4—a new type of rubber-covered field
cable which helps the Signal Corps establish communica-
tions quickly. When connected to suitable terminal carrier
equipment, this Western Electric product provides three
telephone and four telegraph circuits in a single cable—
about the thickness of a fat pencil—containing four
spiralling wires.
Another important feature of Spiral-4 is that an enemy
tapping this cable—when carrier channels only are being
utilized—would get nothing but a jumble of sounds.
This new carrier type communications system is but
one of many war products on which Western Electric
engineers are working now—developing special manufac-
turing equipment and methods. This field of Engineering
for manufacture offers a wide range of opportunity to
men who are interested in the technical problems of
production.

Apropos of the football season now in
progress, it has occurred to us that
every sportswriter seems to have his fa-
vorite method of forecasting scores but
an infallible system has yet to be de-
vised. We are doubly proud, therefore,
to be able to announce to the world our
discovery of the only absolutely positive
system of forecasting. Our method is
unique in that the predictions are made
shortly after the end of the second half
of the game in question. As proof of
the discovery, we offer our first two

When several hundred servicemen
sitting together began to cheer vocifer-
ously at the Indiana game, everyone
looked up quickly to see the touchdown
play, for they thought that nothing
could bring on cheering like that ex-
cept a touchdown. What they saw, in-
stead, was a bevy of beautiful girls
walking (then running) in front of the
servicemen's section. We want it un-
derstood, once and for all, that the
servicemen stationed on campus will
have to learn some manners to be ac-
cepted socially. Besides, darn it, why
couldn't the queens have walked past
our section?
vox pop
As was stated here last issue, females
predominate in the freshman class by
approximately eight to one. In order
to arrive at a conclusion concerning this
younger generation, the Technic has
undertaken a private survey among the
members of this class, the results of
which are given below.
Question: What do you think of the
sex (ratio) in your class of '47?
Mr. Hugh Wolfe, '47, Flint, Michi-
gan: "I'm perfectly satisfied. I've got
my eight."

Mr. Schuyler van Smythe, in Long
Island, New York: "At prep school, I
constantly enjoyed enlightening discus-
sions of current events and such with
the other fellows, but now, due to the
overwhelming predominance of the gen-
tler sex, I am at a loss as to the dis-
bursement of my free moments." (The
Technic, in the interest of Science, is
at present conducting an investigation
of Mr. van Smythe.)
Miss Priscilla Dowler, '47, Ypsilanti,
Michigan: 'T don't understand the
meaning of the word 'sex'." (Unfortu-
nately, even after attempting to en-
lighten Miss Dowler, we could not ob-
tain a statement.)
Mr. Joseph Blofsk, '47, Brooklyn,
New York,: "It's de nertz, an' youse
kin quert me!" (The Technic feels
that Mr. Blofsk will go far in the Engi-
neering College.)
Present also when the survey was be-
ing taken, was Mr. Henry J. Zelch, '43,
of Auburn, New York, who had this to
say of the developments: "It's wonder-
ful. By the way, you can change that
'43 to Grad."

lish results of subsequent polls, not only

pus groups as well.

complaint dep't.
For want of something better to com-
plain about, we will complain this
month about lack of cooperation be-
tween the cheerleaders and the band at
football games. Not once this fall have
we seen either group recognize the other
as anything but competition. Essen-
tially, both are there for the same pur-
pose, namely, that of arousing any spirit
that the student body is capable of
showing. Why, then, since the band and
the cheerleaders have a common goal.
can't they work toward that goal to-
gether? Why must the band barge in
during a cheer so that the cheerleaders
must give up in disgust, and, likewise,
why do the cheerleaders insist upon
beginning a cheer while the band is
playing when they know that, not only
are they contributing toward the general
disunity, but that they will get very lit-
tle if any response? Our band ranks
among the very top bands in the coun-
try, barring none, and it seems to us
that with a little cooperation the cheer-
ing section could be just as superior.
The band itself, as a matter of fact, by
entering whole-heartedly into every
cheer would form a strong nucleus for
a successful cheering section. This
would be a big step toward reviving the
kind of spirit that Michigan ought, by
rights, to have.

A standard complaint long prevalent
among male students has been the lack

lieve, however, that a satisfactory sub-

STEPS TOWARD TOP PERFORMANCE,
WITH CARBIDES, WHEN YOU




CUT AT HIGH SPEEDS—For
top performance on the average
«tcel-cutting job, don't cut at
speeds leas than 200 feet per min-
ute. Slow speeds often cause failure.
USE CORRECT CHIP
BREAKER —When you break
chips, break them right. Fit
breaker to the job. The ground-in
step-type shown is usually best.
COOLANT— IF you use a coolant,
provide a heavy, continuous
stream, preferably under pressure.
If you can't provide ample coolant,
it is better to cut dry.



KEEP TOOLS SHARP—Avoid
running tools until excessively dull.
This causes breakage or drastically
shortened tool life. Grind tools at
regular intervals for Best results.
PROVIDE RIGID SET-UP—
Keep tools at absolute minimum
overhang necessary to clear work.
Chuck part firmly. Rigidity is
important with carbides.
FEEDS—For medium and heavy-
cuts on steel, use feed not less
than .010" per revolution, and pref-
erably .015" to .025*. Light feeds
"rub" tool, causing rapid dulling.
# Important in getting top performance, when cutting steel with
carbides, are the six steps shown above. When correctly applied,
carbide tools produce results far surpassing the performance of
ordinary tools. They operate at machine speeds as high as 4 to 5
times faster than ordinary tools, stay sharp up to 10 times longer,
and increase output often as much as 300%.
Important, too, is the carbide you use. When you select from
the complete line of carbides produced by Carboloy Company,
you get the best type for your particular job—whether it be the
popularly designated "titanium carbides", "tantalum carbides",
"tungsten carbides"—or "tri-carbide" grades.

blue devil
Here on the U, of M. campus, we
have one of the greatest football play-
ers the country has produced in a dec-
ade and the majority of the students
are completely ignorant of this fact.
George McAfee, although he is playing
no football here in Ann Arbor, has al-
ready made quite a name for himself
both from his gridiron feats at Duke
University and later with the Chicago
Bears.

George McAfee
George came to the University last
June as a Chief Specialist to aid in the
physical training program of navy and
marine students. Unfortunately, he was
not available for football this fall, but
George claims, if he were here as a
student, he would be only too happy to
play football with Fritz Crisler's Wol-
verines.
The Chief's football history is a book
in itself and we can only touch the
highlights. As a sophomore he helped
(Continued from Page 18)
Wallace Wade's Duke eleven to the
Southern Conference title, something
not at all unusual for the North Caro-
lina boys.
As a junior, George was hampered by
a foot injury, but saw enough action late
in the season to help Duke to a perfect
season in which they won nine games
and were unscored upon while rolling
up 114 points over some of the nation's
best. The climax of the season was a
7-0 defeat of mighty Pitt who had pre-
viously bowled over eight consecutive
opponents. This feat brought Duke to
the Rose Bowl, where, on January 1,
1939, 92,000 fans watched Duke lose a
heartbreaker. With SO seconds to go,
Southern California scored the first
touchdown of the season against the
Blue Devils and Duke was defeated 7-3.
George's last year, 1939, was his
best, as he led Duke to the third
straight Southern conference title. That
year, only Pitt stopped Duke, but they
didn't stop McAfee. George played the
best game of his career but he could not
offset a missed point after touchdown.
Pitt won 14-13.
After graduation in 1940, George was
selected to play with the college all
stars, but due to indefinite plans, he was
unable to play. He also saw action
with the eastern team in the annual East-
West game.
With the Chicago Bears, Pros' best,
in 1940 and '41, George again starred as
his team took two more championships.
In five years of competition, George
played on nothing but championship
teams.
In '41, he carried the ball 65 times
and gained 475 yards for an average of
7.3 yards per try. He missed being
professional football's leading ground
gainer by a mere 12 yards. In this year
he also scored 72 points which is quite
an achievement in a league of all-stars.
George weighs 180 pounds, and
stands an even six feet. Besides his
spectacular football ability, he is the
answer to any track coach's prayer for
he has been timed for the century in
the very fast time of :09.7 seconds. At
Duke, he also played outfield on the
varsity nine during his senior year.
George says that he may play foot-
ball again depending on the length of
the war so when the war is over sport's
fans, watch your local newspaper for
the further adventures of George Mc-
Afee.

Heres what's cooking on ours
We're very much aware of what you are doing.
It's because we are grateful that we want
to tell you this.
You've never known industry—not really
well. It's probably still a vague place that
makes things you buy. You probably think
of us as just a place aluminum comes from
.. . the aluminum that makes the planes you
are going to work with.
But we're people—fathers and older
brothers, mothers and sisters, doing the most
interesting work we know.
When you come back you'll see this other
sideof industry. You'll see people figuringout
what they can do to make a better world, and
you will want to join them, doing something
to make the peace rich and worth the fight.
There will be a great many things to be
done. A lot of them will be done with
aluminum.
Think of all the things the world is going
to want in a hurry. A great deal of them will
be shipped by air. So they'll be as light as
possible. That's one reason why they'll be
aluminum.
Millions of things are waiting for some-
one to make them lighter or more resistant
to corrosion, brighter, prettier, cheaper.
They'll be made of aluminum, too.
None of that can start till the war's over.
But just as soon as our wartime job is done,
we mean to make aluminum make a lot
of jobs.
And that's what's cooking on our campus.
We're studying right now ways of making
those jobs. Some of them, we hope, will be
right here at Alcoa Aluminum. Still more
will be in industries using aluminum for the
first time. Wherever they are, they should
be exciting.

(continued from page 15)
that is to say, specific limited parts of
the surface which have a very high ac-
tivity. The constituent atoms of these
parts were imagined to be very loosely
attached to the bulk of the catalyst so
that their valency bonds were not com-
pletely satisfied. Variations in degree
between the most active and quite inert
parts of the surface were also to be ex-
pected.
In support of such views are the fol-
lowing facts: (1) the catalyst surface is
sensitive to heat, so that it sinters and
loses activity at temperatures consider-
ably below the normal melting point of
the component; (2) chemical combina-
tion takes place between the catalyst
and a gas under conditions where the
massive component would not react as
for example in the case of iron catalysts
and oxygen; (3) the surface is often
poisoned by very small concentrations of
an impurity, and the absorption of dif-
ferent gases is affected to varying de-
grees by the same poison; (4) the heat
of adsorption of a gas on the catalyst is
not uniform, nor is the heat of activa-
tion of adsorption on the surface; (5)
different parts of the surface are in-
volved in specific reactions.
The Theory of Adlineation
A modified view concerning the loca-
tion of activity in the catalyst has been
expressed by Schwab and Pietsch, in
which the actives centers of Taylor's
theory are replaced by phase boundaries.
This means that reaction will occur
mainly on a series of lines in the cata-
lyst, so that the term adlineation has
been applied to the theory.
There is ample experimental proof
for the evidence of preferential adsorp-
tion of ions on crystal edges, as illus-
trated by the phenomena of crystal
growth in mixed solutions and by the
coloring of different faces of a crystal
growing in liquids containing mixtures
of dyes. Pietsch has also demonstrated
that reactions on crystal surfaces occur
at linear discontinuities of the solid;
this point is illustrated by microscopic
examination of such changes as that be-
tween crystals of hydrated copper sul-
fate and hydrogen sulphide, or between
solid nickel sulfate and dimethvlglyox-
ime. Such examples are not, perhaps,
strictly comparable with that of a gas
in contact with a catalyst, but illustrate
the point in a qualitative manner.
State of the Molecule on Catalyst
Surface
A more precise description of the
state of individual molecules on the sur-
face of a catalyst has been attempted by
a few investigators, among whom Burk
and Baladin may be mentioned.
Burk postulated that, for a molecule
AB to be activiated so that it could un-
dergo decomposition, both parts must
be simultaneously attached to the sur-
face so that a certain amount of strain
was set up. The molecule held by means
of a single link attached to the A or B
part of the molecule alone is not in a
state to undergo decomposition, and it
is emphasized that pairs of active spots
which are to act simultaneously must be
very close to each other in order to
share a single molecule.
Experimental support of these views
is very difficult to find, and one of
Burk's strongest arguments was based
on the observation that the presence of
a poison on a catalyst did not reduce
the adsorption of a reaclant at the same
time as it lowered the activity. Such
measurements, however, were made at
ordinary temperatures, and no informa-
tion is yet available as to the effect of
poisons on activated adsorption at high-
er temperatures.
The presence of more than one type
of active center in a catalyst is accord-
ingly more likely to give rise to decom-
positions and the qualitative effects of
promoter action may be thus explained.
Other Theories of Catalytic Action
Mention must be made to explain
catalysis by hypothesis distinct from
any of those which have been already
discussed. Xyrop postulates an atmos-
phere of rapidly moving electrons over
a catalyst surface, the effect then de-
pending on the maximum kinetic energy
of the free electrons of the catalyst. As
a consequence of this assumption it is
deduced that adsorbed molecules would
react just like gas molecules, and the re-
action products formed would be those
with highest ionization energy or lowest
molecular weight. Promoter action is
attributed to an increase in catalyst
area, while poisoning, by traces of water,
of the iron catalyst used in the synthesis
of ammonia, is supposed to bz due to
the formation of nitric oxide. There are
many arguments against these supposi-
tions; for instance, there is no evidence
that the adsorbed layer is completely
mobile, nor that reaction may occur as
a result of van der Waal's adsorption
alone, and it is known that promoter
action is not due to an increase in ef-
fective area. Cady and White have also
discussed the theory, and pointed out
that the kinetic energy of surface elec-
trons should be greater when an alter-
nating current of about 3000 cycles
passes through a metallic catalyst fila-
ment, which should therefore exhibit
greater activity. This was investigated
with a nickel strip tested by its effect on
the combination of hydrogen and oxy-
gen, but a frequency of SO kilocycles
and currents up to 50 milliamperes gave
no evidence of increased activity. O.
Schmidt has suggested that catalytic
hydrogenation may take place by two
alternative mechanisms. With elements
having large atomic volumes and small
electron expulsion work, such as Cs, Ca,
Si, and Ba, negative hydrogen ions are
supposed to be formed; on account of
the ease with which free electron are
produced, this is equivalent to the pres-
ence of hydrides in which the hydrogen
behaves as a positive ion.
With elements which have a small
atomic volume and a large electron ex-
pulsion work, on the other hand, the
electrons are unstable and hydrogen
functions as a positive ion within the
crystal cracks, as it cannot exist on the
surface. This would occur in the case
of copper, chromium, manganese, iron,
cobalt, nickel, platinum, and other ele-
ments, and hydrogenation would take
place in solid solution.
It does not appear likely that this
theory would account for many of the
phenomena now associated with cataly-
sis, such as activated adsorption, pois-
oning, and increased effects due to pro-
moter action, and it is also difficult to
see how the very similar effects which
are often produced by elements and by
compounds could be reconciled with
such suppositions.

What you see here is a night scene and some
daytime views of the immense butadiene and

Chemicals Corporation, a Unit of UCC,
has designed and built at Institute, West Vir-

Carbide and Carbon also has completed an-
other butadiene plant at Louisville, Kentucky
—and has released plans to Koppcrs United
Company for a third butadiene plant near
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
Butadiene had never been manufactured in
the United States in large quantities before the
plants at Institute went into production. The
task involved in providing the mass produc-
tion facilities the Government asked for was
an unusual one...but one that took full advan-
tage of the experience and processes devel-
oped by Carbide and Carbon.
Generally, it requires seven to ten years for
a company to take a process developed in the
laboratory, put that process lo test in a pilot
plant, iron out production problems, design a

according to quantum mechanics, a pos-
sible explanation of the effect of a cata-
lyst was that it allowed penetration of
the energy barrier between the initial
and final stages of a reaction; this is
the so-called tunnel theory. Cremer
and Polanyi showed that if this were
really the case with a hydrogenation re-
action, the velocity of the change should
be very materially less with deuterium
than with hydrogen, and that therefore,
there should be a concentration of the
former in carrying out such a process
with a mixture of the two. All attempts
to demonstrate such an effect were,
however, unsuccessful.
Although the precise nature of acti-
vation is not yet understood, all recent
experimental work on catalysis is lead-
ing back to ideas closely approaching
the old intermediate compound theory,
and is gaining stronger support to the
view that valency forces are involved in
activated adsorption.
There appears to be no reason to
abandon the concept of active parts of
the catalyst having specific adsorptive
effects, and it is to be anticipated that
the further application of existing meth-
ods of study of kinetics and of energy
relations is the most promising line to
follow in clearing up the various points
which are still obscure.
Experimental Methods
For the study of reaction kinetics,
static methods are preferable, the sim-
plest type of apparatus often giving suf-
ficient insight into a process. The use
of a relatively inert catalyst is generally
preferable to one which has a very high
activity, as it enables the course of the
reaction to be followed more accurately.

for the study of gases at very low pres-
sures, and the later technique of Bod-
enstein and of Hinshelwood, exemplify
the apparatus which is required in de-
terminations of this kind.
As the catalysts necessary for this
class of experiment are of the simplest
type, being generally wires of platinum,
gold, silver, or other metals, little need
be said as to special methods of prep-
aration. The activity of wire can, how-
ever, be modified to a considerable ex-
tent by pre-treatment such as heating to
a high temperature, or by cold working,
etching, and alternations of oxidation
and reduction. It is always necessary,
during a lengthy series of experiments
with any particular catalyst, to check
the activity at intervals under standard
conditions in order to be certain that
drift effects, activation, or poisoning
have not introduced a further variable
into the determination.
The Preparation of Catalysts
The fact that it is generally desirable
to prepare catalysts under carefully con-
trolled conditions, especially to avoid
high temperature, makes a precipitated
material a useful starting point, and
such a substance is particularly adapted
to handling in paste form. In other
cases recourse must be made to very fine
grinding by means of a paint mill or
some similar device, in order to obtain
a produce which will bind satisfactorily
into pellets. It is generally preferable
to select a starting material which will
undergo some chemical change before
it is converted into the form which ac-
tually functions as the catalyst. For in-
stance, a nickel catalyst can be prepared
by the reduction of nickel hydroxide, or
tungsten oxide can be obtained by de-
hydration of tungstic acid, and a sul-
phide may be produced by passing hy-
drogen sulphide over an oxide in granu-
lar form.
The shape of the particles will have
an effect on the results obtained in cases
where the rate of diffusion of the re-
actants to the catalyst surface is the
factor controlling the speed of the re-
action.
The size of the catalyst pellet used m
the reaction vessel will depend some-
what on the conditions used but the
most desirable size can be readily deter-
mined in each case. Adadurov and Ger-
net found that the extent of conversion
of sulphur dioxide to trioxide in contact
with vanadium catalysts depended on
the shape of the lumps and their resist-
ance to gas flow, hemisphercial pieces
being preferable to those of rectangu-
lar character. It is necessary to avoid
such finely divided powders so that chan-
neling occurs or that excessive back
pressure is thrown on the system, or that
dust is carried over by the gas stream
passing through the catalyst layer. At
the same time, each particle should be
porous and completely accessible to the
reactants, anything in the nature of a
hard glaze on the outside of a pellet be-
ing undesirable.
Carriers
The selection of carriers or supports
is usually made from a fairly limited
range of materials such as China-clay,
yellowclay, bauxite, silica-gel, alumina-
gel, pumice or charcoal. Charcoal and
other natural products are open to the
objection that they vary considerably in
character from sample to sample; the
former has a variable ash content which
may play an important part in catalytic
changes. It is also open to the objec-
tion that re-oxidation of the catalyst,
which may be necessary in technical
processes, is not possible on account of
the combustion of the carrier which
would occur.
Factors Affecting Catalyst Activity
The activity of the catalyst will
chiefly depend on its specific nature, the
temperature at which it is used, and the
conditions under which the raw mate-
rials are applied. Typical time-activity
curves are shown below:


* A
TIME
Curve A is the more usual form in
which a high initial activity decreases
fairly rapidly and this is maintained
over very long periods. Curve B is sim-
ilar to the former but no steady period
is ever attained, and a slow downward

The Synthetic Age
ushers in
a New Era for the Coke Oven
Nearly half a million new combinations of the molecules
have been developed since the synthetic age came in. Mil-
lions of new ones are possible. Nearly every time a synthetic
material has been developed it has meant a drastic reduction
m the price of the material and that has meant an ever-
widening market, in the familiar pattern of mass-production.
In the last year for which official figures arc available,
almost half of the synthetic organic chemicals produced in
America came from coal tar sources.
Vast new opportunities stretch away before the modern
coke oven and before the people who work with it.
Koppers is the largest builder of coke ovens. It is one
of the principal producers and distillers of tar from which
many of the chemical wonders stem. It is one of the first
designers and builders of recovery plants from which come
materials for use in plastics, synthetic rubber, paints,
varnishes, dyes, solvents, motor fuel, disinfectants, medi-
cines, flavors, explosives. One of Koppers affiliates is the
nation's largest independent producer of bituminous coal.

strate ability to stand up under stress.
The basic course of the Army and the
first two terms of Navy are given in
many schools in all sections of the coun-
try, schools that have not had experi-
ence in offering rigorous programs. Nat-
urally there is a considerable amount of
confusion regarding standards in the
early stages of the program. However,
it is hoped that when students are trans-
ferred to the advanced phases in other
schools they will be able to adjust them-
selves without too many fatalities and
will find that the tempo experienced in
the initial college is not materially dif-
ferent from that of the technical school.
The emphasis on engineering training
in each of these programs points to the
all-important role of the engineer in
modern warfare. From the production
centers in the United States to the front
line activities of the Corps of Engineers,
young men who have had engineering
training are demanded in practically all
branches of the military and naval serv-
ice. This situation offers to the engi-
neering colleges of the United States a
unique opportunity to render service to
the nation. In training the youth for
duties with the Ordnance Department,
the Corps of Engineers, Signal Corps,
Chemical Warfare Service, specialists
are produced; the basic curricula also
provides a foundation for duty in the
Ground Forces. The Navy program
trains specialists in Civil Engineering,
Construction, Mechanical Engineering
(Steam and Internal Combustion En-
gines), Electrical Engineering (Power
and Communication), and in Aeronauti-
cal Engineering; also, it provides curric-
ula for general engineer officers, deck
officers, and aviation cadets. Other voca-
tions are represented in these programs,
but the engineering and related curricula
serve by far the larger number of stu-
dents in the greatest educational proj-
ects of all time.
These programs present an unusual
opportunity for the young men selected
to serve their country and at the same
time to prepare for a career either in the
armed forces or in civil life. The method
of selection is democratic. Financial
worries disappear for the time. The stu-
dent has the opportunity to devote his
attention whole-heartedly to his work
and to live under pleasant circumstances
in a college community, even if the com-
munity is rapidly becoming a military or
naval academy.

drift persists until zero activitity is at-
tained. In curve C the activity rises
from a low value and then becomes
steady over long periods.
It is with catalysts of the B type,
where a steady fall occurs, that the
question of regeneration becomes im-
portant; it may be studied experiment-
ally in the same way as the usual ac-
tivity determinations. An example is
illustrated where the change in activity
of a vanadium oxide catalyst used for
the conversion of cresol to toluene by
hydrogenation at 440 degrees under at-
mospheric pressure is plotted against
time.

Owing to the gradual accumulation of
tarry products on the surface of the
catalyst, the activity fell as shown, but
on treating the catalyst with a stream of
air at the same temperature, the activity
was restored practically to its initial
value, and then fell off again in pre-
cisely the same way as before when
more cresol was admitted.
Conclusion
The net result of all the research in
the subject of catalysis is that we have
before us not a uniform theory of cata-
lysis, but a field of which the attraction
lies in the variety with which the dif-
ferent principles operate. With the grow-
ing penetration of science, technology
has increasingly made use of the possi-
bilities thus offered and, in its turn, has
placed problems of a special, but quite
fundamental nature, before science.
The "Riddle of Catalysis" is in general
still unsolved; most of all, we do not
know why a substance catalyzes a re-
action. However, we often know how it
happens, and see in this knowledge our
mastery of catalyzed reactions and the
goal of the investigation.

While at high school, Bud got a model
A, and in three summers drove it 30,-
000 miles. Last summer, he related, he
drove to Iowa City to see a girl. Com-
ing back, the car broke down. Looking
up, Bud saw a sign: "Ann Arbor-2
miles"! When he was home, Bud was
offered seventy five dollars for the car,
but declined for "sentimental reasons."
When he came to the university, Bud
entered the Lit school, planning a Pre-
Med course. Just before school started,
he happened to look through an Engi-
neering School catalog and decided then
and there decided that engineering was
for him. "I couldn't get the grease ofi
my hands," he said. Bud came to
Michigan with the idea that the thing
to do was to forget extracurricular ac-
tivities and concentrate solely on his
studies. He did this his first couple of
semesters, becoming what he termed a
"grind." While at home, he was ad-
vised by a friend, a personnel manager
of a large plant, not to concentrate too
much on his studies, but to strike a
happy medium between studies and ac-
tivities. With this in mind, Bud came
back to Michigan and began his very
active career. Now he finds that he
does better work in school if he is busy
in activities and "the pressure is on.'
Bud says that this balance between
studies and activities is one of the most
important things he has learned at col-
lege.
Bud has several things he would like
to do after graduation (in February)
He would like to join the Navy, study-
Law (he thinks it would be of inesti-
mable value to him later on), go further
into Aerodynamics (in which he is
keenly interested) and/or work in
transportation in Brazil, which he
thinks has great potentialities. In pos-
sible preparation for Brazil, he took
Spanish, and spent a part of one sum-
mer in Mexico, where he picked up
quite a bit of Portuguese.
Among Bud's hobbies are model air-
plane building and photography. Since
finals were going on at the time of thi*
interview we decided at this point that
we had better be going. "I've got three
finals left," said Bud, "but how can I
study when I think that Dad and I are
going to spend my vacation photo-
graphing the Rocky Mountains"!

HE FUTU RE WILL BE YOUR RESPONSIBILITY!
leans* ia Uh&amp;ua you/i &amp;easUMXfl NOW
American colleges turn out good engi-
neers. That's why so many of the world's
greatest engineering achievements stand
to America's credit.
The world of the future will be a world
of wheels and wings to an extent that
cannot be completely foreseen now. But
one thing is sure—it will be a world
of bearings, too, for wherever wheels or
shafts turn, they must turn on bearings.
It is not too much to say, in view of
their present dominant position, that it
will be a world of Timken Tapered
Roller Bearings; for there is no bear-
ing requirement that Timken Bearings
cannot meet.
So, while you are still studying, learn to
know your Timken Bearings thoroughly
—their design, application and potential-
ities. Then you'll be still better equipped
for your job when college days are over
and you take up the responsibilities of
a full-fledged engineer. The Timken

speed with which industry can make
the shift. The thing we need most to
be assured of is that it shall be an or-
derly procedure, looking to the return of
free exercise of ingenuity and enterprise
as the third and final leg of the long
journey back.
As has been said, the first phase (re-
lease of badly needed civilian goods) can
hardly be accompanied by any notice-
able new design or invention. It is the
second and third phases of our return
to complete peace that the expected
revolution in design, performance and
efficiency is being heralded as ready to
take place and it is here that it will be a
good idea to stop and consider the de-
lays that are inherent in effecting sound
changes of design.
The building of a line of electric re-
frigerators, for instance, involves an in-
vestment in jigs, dies, and fixtures of
around two million dollars. Their pro-
duction, even after a design is com-
pleted, is a matter that requires many
months before they can actually be put
in use on machines. Our tool rooms to-
day are jammed with war work, and al-
though there will be a relief from the
tool load as the war picture changes,
the manpower involved will probably
continue to be very much needed.
Radical changes in designs and engi-
neering for new efficiencies always carry
with them uncertainty as to the success
of operation in the field, and also as to
acceptance by the purchasing public.
These changes all have to be tested
commercially as they are developed.
The idea, therefore, that we may look
for the type of radical revision in these
present articles of daily household use
seems to be based entirely on what may
be an ultimate picture and not an im-
mediate one.
A great deal of design for new use-
fulness and new efficiency is being done
now. Much thought is being given to
the form which may best please the eye.
Many things are beyond the research
stage and in the hands of designers at
this moment, ready for the toolroom
and for commercial tests of actual prod-
ucts at the point that our gradually ris-
ing curve permits.
The housing business, for instance, is
the basis of much of the research that
is being done by the producers of metals,
plywood, and glass, even today. First,
comes the query as to whether our fu-
ture homes are to be manufactured in
factories and erected on the site (pre-
fabricated housing), or whether we are
going to demand an individuality in de-
sign and a permanence that will be per-
mitted only by the older masonry and
carpentry which has characterized our
earlier homes.
As to materials, plywood manufac-
turers have made great strides in de-
fense housing, and these manufacturers,
along with the producers of various
types of wall boards, are preparing to
make a strenuous bid for the housing of
the future on a prefabricated basis. Not
to be outdone, producers of copper,
aluminum, and steel are also studying
and researching on this business of
housing.
Estimates vary, but there seems to be
a feeling that a million and a half homes
will be built each year, at least, for the
first six years after our complete relief
from the breathless needs of war. Cer-
tainly, some will be prefabricated, some
will be built by contractors to the older
standards, but the market, in any event,
appears to be vast and worth a fight by
the makers of the various competitive
materials.
Undoubtedly, the decade that is now
starting will see rapid and radical im-
provements. The war time research has
given us many new and practical ideas
and we can expect to move faster in the
coming ten years than we have in the
past ten years. Still, that jump will be
represented by a steeper curve, I be-
lieve, rather than by a sudden jump to
the radically new. The battle of mate-
rials will still have to be fought during
the transition period.
Another thing that catches the imagi-
nation is the talk of the era of light
metals. In 1939, there was a total
aluminum capacity of 300 million pounds
per year. Today there is theoretical
capacity of two billion pounds per year.
One hundred and fifty one million
pounds of aluminum were actually pro-
duced in July, 1943.
Magnesium, which rates high as ma-
terial for strong and light die castings,
is also important as an alloy of alumi-
num. Remarkable results are being at-
tained with these two metals in produc-
ing light structural shapes as well as the
sheets and die castings with which we
are more or less familiar.
The men who produce aluminum and
magnesium have to figure what use can
be made of so vast an increased output,
and they are busy on the theory that
the prices of these metals will be con-
siderably down and that their applica-
tions can be greatly broadened.
Likewise, the manufacturers of plas-
tics are heralding a plastic age even to
the point of thoughts of an all-plastic
automobile.
The steel industry is not asleep but
is busy with new alloys that present
much greater strength to weight ratio
than we have been used to, and in the
stainless field, they bid fairly to offer new
permanency to the places where they
are used.
It is easy to be led into a partisan
spirit toward these new uses of mate-
rials, but here again, the change is
bound to be gradual and bound to be
based on the economics of every indi-
vidual use.
Aluminum ingots priced today at 18c
per pound will, in all probability, find a
level at around 12c so that they will be
more available than before, and these
metals may turn around and supplant
such things as plastic mouldings, which
have been used as substitutions for a
lot of die castings formerly made of the
lighter metals.
We cannot know that an all alumi-
num refrigerator may not prove to be a
low cost and attractive commodity that
will take the market by storm, nor can
we know to the point of investing in all
of the necessary tooling that it will be
these things that will be tested and tried
and figured over until each of the ma-
terials has found its economic level of
effective use. No one can see the end,
but anyone can predict an interesting
battle in the process.
So to sum it all up, it seems reasonable
to expect a gradual release by allocation
of some of the most needed things,
building up to brand new levels of quan-
tity production just as rapidly as mate-
rials and men are available for their
production. In design, we may expect
to start with the tools and designs we
now have, incorporating new features of
performance and new uses, as sound
methods of the testing of designs per"
mit. These changes, too, are expected to
be gradual at the start but considerable
in the total over the few years following
the armistice.
Certainly, an intensified industrial
age is to be expected, not only in regard
to those things which we use every day,
but in transportation, in power produc-
tion, and in the tools and methods of
our industrial machine.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


CABLE sheaves for mining, drilling,
and hoisting equipment are sub-
jected to unusually heavy strains these
war days. To stand up under continuous
operation, the sheaves must combine
hardness at the wearing surfaces with
toughness in the spokes and hubs —
contradictory properties not usually
possible in a one-piece metal part.
How could these two conflicting
metal characteristics be incorporated
in the sheaves, without sacrificing either
necessary quality?
Oxyacetylene flame-hardening pro-
vided the answer. Now the cable
grooves, which are most exposed to
wear, are given a hard, wear-resistant
skin by flame hardening, while the re-
mainder of the sheave retains the re-
quired shock-resistance that is already

present in the parent metal.
Thanks to the localized protection
afforded by this modern preventive
treatment, the life-expectancy of the
sheaves has been greatly extended,
and another threatening operating
problem has been nipped in the bud.
Many other equally successful tech-
niques have been developed by Air

application of oxyacetylene flame and
electric arc processes to individual
manufacturing needs.

LET'S GO TO COLLEGE
'I 'HE war has changed our campus
■*• in many ways. Some of these
changes, such as the arrival of the
fine young men of the armed serv-
ices, have been quite pleasant, but
there are few of us who have wel-
comed the decline that has taken place
in the extracurricular activities. Dur-
ing the last several semesters, almost
all of the student organizations have
found it difficult to continue. Many
organizations such as the Union, the
Daily, the Technic, the band and
Glee Club have remained active in
spite of great difficulties. A host of
others, however, including the Gar-
goyle (a fine magazine in spite of all
that we have printed to the con-
trary), and the student senate have
ceased to operate for the duration.
There are probably many people
anxious to hear the death knell of ex-
tracurricular activities because they
have the mistaken idea that all stu-
dent organizations are a peacetime
luxury — an unpleasant hangover
from the giddy raccoon coat and hip
flask college days. If this were the
case, extracurricular activities would
certainly have no place on the war-
time campus—or on any other cam-
pus, for that matter.
The idea that extracurricular ac-
tivities are frivolous and a waste of
valuable time could not be further
from the truth. A college composed
solely of books and classes would be
of little real value. Its graduates
would be a fine collection of timid,
lazy, self-centered individuals. It is
the function of extracurricular activi-
ties to prevent this unhealthy condi-
tion. By participation in the various
campus organizations, the student
acquires confidence and initiative,
learns to shoulder responsibilities and
perhaps most important, learns to
meet and cooperate with his fellow
man. In short, the student "goes to
college."
The question should now be asked.
'What are we going to do to insure
the survival of student organiza-
tions"? We think that the most sensi-
ble plan is for every student in the
university to adopt the attitude held
by the United States Navy. The
navy has stated that its men are per-
mitted to participate in student ac-
tivities so long as their school work
is satisfactory. If student organiza-
tions are to continue, it behooves
each student to adopt the same pol -
icy. Naturally, there are many stu-
dents who because of heavy class or
work schedules will not have time to
participate but to those who have the
ability and the time to spare, we say
"Let's go to college."

... The famous British electric gunsight
is now being used on American planes to
improve the accuracy of fire of fighter
pilots. This instrument consists of a
four inch glass disc placed in front of
the pilot at eye level. The disc is in-
clined backwards at an angle of 45 de-
grees, and the image of a ring sight is
projected on it from below. The inten-
sity of the light can be adjusted to allow
either day or night use. The pilot be-
gins firing when the image of his target
completely fills a break in a horizontal
straight line extending across the ring.
The width of this break is controlled by
two dials at the base of the sight which
are set at the maximum dimension of
the target plane and at the proper range
for opening fire. Although the pilot
must make some rapid calculations for
each encounter, those who have used
the device say that the increased accur-
acy merits the extra trouble. The trans-
parent plate does not interfere with the
pilot's forward vision as did earlier
sights.
... In order to expedite the supply of
iron products for west coast shipyards
and aircraft plants, a 180 million dollar
steel plant has been built at Geneva,
Utah, just south of Salt Lake City. All
the ore, coal and limestone used is mined
in the state, thus tapping vast but for-
merly unused resources. Since the plant
was built far from centers of popula-
tion, large barracks and numerous trail-
ers were supplied by the Columbia Steel
Company and the Federal Public Hous-
ing Authority to house the workers and
their families brought in from a dis-
tance. In addition, an entire new vil-
lage, including school, hospital, stores,
churches, and water and power supply
is being laid out for the permanent use
of the 20,000 people moved to the plant
site.

... To prevent the warping of armor
plate during quenching, it is placed in
a press and water is sprayed on it from
openings in the top and bottom dies.
This method, developed by the Drever
Company, replaces the old method of
tank quenching and mechanical straight-
ening, and produces a more uniformly
hardened product while decreasing the
expense.
... Another use of photo-electric cells is
to protect the fingers of workers from
dangerous machinery. This widely used
system either turns off the machine or
pushes away the vulnerable parts of the
operator's body when they get too close.
A new refrigerant, "Freon 12", makes
possible the air-conditioning of sub-
marines, to the extent that the crew can
even smoke while the ship is submerged.
The fluid is not poisonous, and will not
burn, explode, or support flame. The
machinery used is of the reversible cycle
type, so that the interior of the sub-
mersible can be either cooled or heated
by it, as the occasion demands.
... Did you ever wonder what makes
large artillery shells follow the rifling
in the gun barrel, thus giving them their
spinning motion? This is accomplished
by putting a soft copper band around
the projectile, extending out far enough
to be cut into and gripped by the hard
steel spirals.
... To prevent the rapid rusting of
equipment on the Normandie when the
ship was raised, all machinery aboard
was sprayed with a special rust-discour-
aging oil as each item cleared the water
surface. This product penetrates water
films and actually pushes the fluid away
from the metal. Since rusting is espe-
cially active when long submerged steel
is exposed to the air and occurs at an al-
most visible rate, the only piece of
equipment that was damaged was a tur-
bine that was alternately exposed and
covered by the slight rise and fall of
the tide. Even electric motors were so
treated, although most oils damage the
armatures. A more volatile fluid was
used on these items, which left them
completely dry and ready for use within
a week. •

The glass "yardstick"
that can't tell a lie!

To turn molded glass into
a precision instrument
requires careful, accurate
grinding. Carborundum makes
grinding wheels with which
plug, ring and snap gages
of glass are quickly ground
to the required accuracy
and finish. This latest
use of grinding is another
example of the increasing
importance of abrasives
in war production.
Now they're making precision gages,
on which mass output of planes and
other weapons depends, out of glass.
Why glass? It saves strategic mate-
rial. Can't rust or corrode. Is less
affected by heat. Surface scratches
or knicked edges don't impair its
accuracy. Costs less. Lasts longer.
And it can't tell a lie. If a glass
gage is dropped, either it breaks or
is as good as new; there is no un-
suspected distortion.


When you get out into industry,
remember that Carborundum research
and experience are at your dis-
posal, ready to help you solve any
abrasive problem you may encounter.

oil products, a 20 inch gasoline line is
being laid alongside the "Big Inch,"

... Much confusion has arisen over the
new miracle drug penicillin, mainly be-
cause very little is known about it, even
by those who produce it. Because of
wartime exigencies, the usual painstak-
ing clinical tests were largely omitted
and are now being made up only by
field experience. It is used to supple-
ment the sulfa compounds in treating
battle casualties, but no one can state
just what types of infections it will or
will not destroy. Cures effected with it
are strictly medical miracles, and it is
so potent that, although its price is
$ 18,000 a pound, each dose costs only
$2. The drug is derived from a common
blue mold, but as yet its chemical com-
postion is unknown, so it cannot be syn-
thesized. No way has been found to
grow it continuously, and our present
output, which is measured in ounces, is
produced in batches is small glass flasks.
The use of penicillin has been refused in
many civilian cases, but of course its
scarcity is due not only to military
needs but also to production difficulties.
Nevertheless, we are looking forward to
the day when it will be turned out in
large enough quantities to permit its
marvelous properties to benefit all man-
kind.
... The destructive power of fragmenta-
tion bombs is being increased by slip-
ping a coiled wire casing over each mis-
sile. A half inch thick casing on a two
and one-half inch bomb is estimated to
shatter into five hundred jagged frag-

to watches after the war. This process
will very nearly replace the former

tained with 100-octane gasoline. Pos-
sessing remarkable anti-knock proper-
ties, the hydrocarbon will permit higher

resulting efficiency increases. Although
it has been known for years, only re-
cently has triptane been made commer-
cially available, at a price of $1 a gallon
compared to the former $3000. It can-
not be used, however, in existing en-
gines without causing severe structural

Roughing tools conventionally mounted on turret
lathes or hand screw machines have a tough time
cutting hex bar stock. Intermittent cutting, accom-
panied by successive severe shocks make frequent
resharpening necessary. This means equally fre-
quent machine shutdowns.
The problem of eliminating the lost time on such
jobs has been solved in a New England plant by
an ingenious rig applied to some old turret lathes.
The rig consists essentially of two bars. One,
carrying the roughing tool, is pivoted to the turret.
The other, having a very simple adjustable cam on
its lower side, is fastened between the top of the

turret and a sliding support on the headstock.
As the turret advances the roughing tool, the
cam feeds it downward, then guides it horizontally
and supports it transversely while the roughing
cut is made. A drill or other inside tool may be fed
in to work simultaneously.
When the roughing cut is finished, the tool is
backed off, and the finishing tool fed in on the
cross slide. When the roughing tool needs re-
sharpening, it is simply a matter of a few minutes
to take it out of the holder and put a sharp tool in.
Shutting down is unnecessary. There is less need
for expert grinding and resetting.

... The wind tunnel is becoming an in-
creasingly important engineering tool.
The facilities of the Aeronautical Engi-
neering Department in the East Engi-
eerng Building have been used recently
to test the aerodynamic properties of
barns, especially the variety with para-
bolic or semicircular cross-sections. Ap-
parently, these structures have an un-
usual tendency to roll over in heavy
winds, even more so than the cor.mon
gable-roofed variety. The reason for
this is that air moving at high velocities
produces strong lift and drag forces on
the barns similar to those of airfoils, or
airplane wings, while on flat, sloping
roofs, the aerodynamic forces are largely
downward.
... A portable breath analyzer to detect
the presence of intoxicating alcohol has
been developed by the teetotalist engi-
neers of Yale University. The device is
intended for use on the site of accidents
or traffic arrests. It consists of a mouth-
piece leading to a battery of reagent
tubes containing iodine pentoxide, which
liberates iodine in proportion to the
amount of alcohol in a sample of the sus-
pect's breath. The iodine is carried to
a starch solution, the color of which is
then examined by a photo-electric cell,
which indicates on a meter the proof of
the unwary indulger's blood. The in-
ventors expect the test to be given legal
status, with the blue-colored starch so-
lution available as court evidence. The
instrument is said to be frighteningly
simple and accurate.
... Now that the Navy has completed
flight tests on the Japanese Zero which
was found practically undamaged in an
Aleution bog, performance characteris-
tics of this type of plane can be stated
quite accurately. This tiny death-trap
climbs at 2600 feet per minute and
reaches a maximum level speed of 328
miles per hour, which is not excessive
compared to Allied planes. However,
the big advantage this fighter possesses
is its maneuverability, which is most
pronounced at speeds of about 200 miles
per hour. The Zero is an ingeniously
conceived airplane in many ways, but
it has several disadvantages, which in-
clude its very light structure and its
non-self sealing gas tanks practically
surrounding the pint-sized cockpit.

; air machines were made in glid-
ers. With the advent and subsequent
improvement of the gasoline engine
came the idea of combining the engine
and the glider. As we know, the Wright
brothers were the first to be successful
in this merger. They built a large glider
and added a light (for those days) gaso-
line engine.
The goal of the early airplane de-
signers was to have as much wing area
as possible per unit of weight. The
lightest materials known by which such
a condition could be maintained were
wood and canvas. It is to be remem-
bered that aluminum and magnesium,
from which planes are now largely con-
structed, were then no more than labora-
tory freaks. Even now, when these light
metals are available, it is not possible
to build a plane with as low a wing load-
ing (weight of the airplane divided by
the wing area) as wood. The light
weight of the plane was essential be-
cause of the poor engines of those early
days. The only gasoline engines obtain-
able were heavy and inefficient. The
best engines developed one horsepower
per 30 or 40 pounds. That is, if an in-
ventor needed a 20 horsepower motor
to get the desired results, the least
weight he could expect would be 600
pounds. A 20 horsepower engine today
would weigh approximately 20 pounds.
Because of the weight of the motor, it
was impossible for planes to be fast.
In order to support the airplane in
flight, the wings had to be so large that
their air resistance was prohibitive.
During World War I, it was decided
that the next best thing to a fast ship
was a maneuverable one. Maneuvera-
bility required a low wing loading, and
wood was still the only material that
met the requirement.
With the steady improvement of en-
gines, wood began to fall out of favor.
Accelerating this change of attitude has
been the discovery of cheap methods to
make aluminum and magnesium. After
the war, speed became the important
thing. Air mail and passenger service
were judged a great deal on the rate at
which they served their customers. As
WOOD IN AIRCRAFT

LAWRENCE HARBECK, '46E
a high wing loading is needed to get
high speeds, the light metals could now
be used. Wood was on the way out.
There are many advantages of metal
planes over the old type wooden ones.
For one, the metal plane is much more
weather resistant. The wooden plane
was formerly a framework of wood cov-
ered with canvas. It was subject to
moisture rot, shrinkage and expansion
from moisture, decay from fungi and in-
sects, and a certain delicateness of con-
stitution which caused it to be easily in-
jured. Obviously, the wood construc-
tion presented a fire hazard. This was
one of the biggest drawbacks of this type
of plane. The canvas was doped with
materials that were highly inflammable.
The metal plane had none of this
trouble. The crash factor was in favor
of metal. When an all metal plane
crashes it holds together reasonably
well, offering some protection to the oc-
cupants. An airplane made of wood and
canvas folds up like an accordion, prom-
ising sure death or injury to the passen-
gers.
The wooden plane of today presents
a more favorable picture. The wood is
used in such a manner that it is quite
different from the older planes. This
will be explained at some length later.
Suffice to say that wood can now be
treated in such a way that it is fire,
weather, and insect-proof. It can be so
formed and molded that it is as strong
HS, if not stronger, than metal. Ply-
wood planes of today are as sturdy as
can be desired, capable of taking the
worst kind of punishment and hard han-
dling. Though wood is usually quite
combustible, it is interesting to note
that plywood is even more fire resistant
than the thin metal used as wing cover-
ings on all metal planes. When plywood
is made fire-proof, it is just that. It will
not burn and it is unaffected in other
ways by heat. Metal (thin sections)
will not burn in the sense that a flame
will be visible. However, under intense
heat, as from a burning engine, it will
oxidize and crumble away. In so far as
the safeness of the plane goes, it is
certain that wood can now be as reliable
as metal.
There are many things to be consid-
ered in the choice of a wood to be used
in constructing an airplane. For one,
the availability of the wood must be
considered. If a large group of planes
is to be made from one set of plans and
in the middle of the process it is dis-
covered that no more of the specified
wood is to be had, a complete revision
of the plans would be necessary. Two,
the ratio of the strength to the weight
of the wood is important. It would not
be advisable to make a plane of wood
that needed bulkiness to give strength.
I mention the rather obvious point to
bring out a new development. It is now
possible to take almost any wood,
within reasonable limits, and by heating
and compresisng it in a special chamber,
impart to it any desired density. This
process is still in the experimental stage,
but if developed, it will mean that a
great number of different types of wood
may be used in connection with the
same set of plans. Three, the wood
should be workable. No hard and fast
rule can be set down for the degree of
ease with which a wood can be worked.
The important thing to be considered
is the use to which the wood is to be put.
In the case of a wing beam where the
wood is not much worked on, species
fairly hard to manage may be used. In
the turning out of a conic tail for a
glider, only the more adaptable types of
wood may be used. Four, the wood
must be suitable for close designing. An
airplane is a fine piece of work, and
every part must fit just right if the fin-
ished product is to be a success. Here is
another case where wood is definitely
better suited for airplane construction
than metal. It is true that metal can
be cut and polished to extremely fine
dimensions; but only at a given temper-
ature. It is impossible to keep metal
from contracting and expanding with
variations of temperature. Since the
coefficient of expansion of wood is
smaller than that of most metals, the
dimensions stay the same after the wood
has had the moisture permanently re-
moved. Last, the tendency of the wood
to lose or absorb water is important. It
is not as important as it was, however.

By
EDWARD YOUNG
Professor of Geodesy and Surveying
EARLY experiments in aerial photog-
raphy were carried out with the aid
of kites and balloons. The first known
photographs taken from an airplane
were made in Italy in 1909, with the
plane piloted by Wilbur Wright. World
War I brought rapid progress, and dur-
ing the early days of the Meuse-Argonne
offensive, 56,000 photographs were pro-
duced. There can be little doubt that
these photographs played an important
part in the outcome of this offensive.
Aerial photography, however, was not
unanimously accepted at this time even
by the armed services. Following the
armistice in 1918, progress in mapping
from aerial photographs was somewhat
retarded. This was partly due to con-
servatism and partly due to over-en-
thusiasm on the part of those who felt
that mapping from aerial photographs
would practically eliminate the neces-
sity for ground control. This is not pos-
sible, since ground measurements are
necessary for scale and tilt determina-
tion, and geodetic positions are neces-
sary for world location.
Aerial photographs are of three types,
vertical, oblique, and composite. Verti-
cal photographs are those taken with
the camera axis vertical, or nearly so.
Oblique photographs are made with the
camera axis inclined to the vertical and

r/ei
are of two types, low obliques which are
used for reconnaissance, and high obli-
ques which show the horizon, and are
suitable for mapping. Composite photo-
graphs are made with a multi-lens cam-
era and usually consist of one vertical
with from two to eight oblique photo-
graphs. The use of vertical photographs
in compiling planimetric maps will be
discussed briefly.
Vertical photographs should be well
.taken. That is, they should have little
or no tilt and have the proper amount of
overlap. The overlap is usually about
60% in the direction of flight and 309;
between flights. This overlap is neces-
sary in order to tie the different prints
together. There are other reasons why
overlap is desirable, but they will not
be discussed here.
To get the desired overlap requires
careful planning of the photographic
mission. The approximate desired scale
of the photographs and the focal length
of the lens being known, the flight alti-
tude can be computed and the distance
between flight lines determined and
plotted on the best available map as an
aid to the pilot. Before starting photo-
graphic operations, the photographer
must, on a trial run, determine the angle
of crab. In other words, if the course to
be flown is south to north, and the wind

is blowing from the west, the pilot must
point the nose of the airplane slightly
to the west to maintain a true northerly
direction of flight. As a result of thi?
sideways motion through the air, the
camera must be rotated slightly clock-
wise in the airplane so that the sides of
the photographs are parallel to the ac-
tual path of flight. The photographer
must also determine the interval be-
tween exposures necessary to produce
the desired overlap in the direction of
flight. All this may be accomplished
with the aid of the separate viewfinder
which is equipped with a special grid on
the ground glass. With the overlap as
already described, each photograph will
contain, in addition to its own center or
principal point, the principal points of
the adjacent photographs. For compila-
tion it is necessary to locate all princi-
pal points on the photographs. The in-
tersection of the lines joining the images
of the collimation marks of the camera
(in this case they are located at the
middle of the sides and ends of the pho-
tographs) (See Figure 1) is the point
where the optical axis of the lens pierces
the photographs, and it is called the
principal point. The centers of adjacent
photographs where they appear on this
photograph can be transferred conven-
iently from the former with the aid of a

12
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


tween these centers on the photograph is
the air base or distance between expo-
sure stations.
Since a map is a projection of some
kind and a photograph is a perspective,
the photograph would correspond to a
map only if the terrain were absolutely
level and camera axis truly vertical.
These conditions would seldom exist in
aerial surveying, as we have hills and
valleys and usually some slight tilt to
the camera axis. Since the hill tops are
nearer to the camera lens than the val-
leys the two will be at different scales.
Strictly speaking, the aerial photograph
has no uniform scale, due to ground re-
lief. Most of us at some time or other
have tilted the hand camera in order to
include the top of a tall building. Our
prints show converging lines, the top of
the building too narrow and the bottom
too wide. Somewhere between the top
and the bottom of the building's image,
there will be a line true to scale, and this
will be on the axis of tilt. In the tilted
aerial photograph we have a similar con-
dition. Along this axis of tilt the scale
would correspond to the scale of a truly
vertical photograph. It can now be seen
that some correction will have to be
made for ground relief and tilt, if pres-
ent in photographs. Displacement of the
photographic image due to ground relief
can best be explained by the diagram.
(Figure 2).
The hill top A has its image at a on
the negative and a' on the positive. B
is the projection of A on the datum
plane, and it would have the correspond-
ing image b on the negative and b' on
the positive. This shows an outward
displacement of the image of the hill
top. Similarly one can see that the
point D below the datum plane will \K
displaced inward. Since these points, as
well as the ground plumb point N, and
the nodal point of the lens are in a ver-
tical plane, it is apparent that the dis-
placements due to ground relief are
radial to the ground plumb point N.
which is a point vertically beneath the
nodal point of the lens.
Figure 3 shows a horizontal and a
tilted photograph. N is the ground
plumb point, P the principal point, and
I the iso-center or center of distortion,
which is a point on the axis of tilt, and
which for small angles of tilt may be
considered midway between P and N.
Points on the low side of the tilted pho-
tograph will be displaced outward, while
those on the high side will have an in-
ward displacement. It can be shown
mathematically that displacements due
to tilt are radial to the iso-center. If the
photographs have small angles of tilt,
the principal point P approaches the
ground plumb point X, and it can be as-
sumed that the displacements caused by
ground relief and tilt are radial to the
principal point P. The errors resulting
from this assumption are too small to
plot. However, when excessive tilts are
encountered, other methods may be em-
ployed. If on our photograph we se-
lect other points and draw straight lines
from the principal points through them,
the true position of these pictures points
will lie somewhere on these radial lines.
Again, if we locate the same picture
points on the adjacent overlapping pho-
tograph and draw similar lines from the
principal point of this photograph to
the points located, the true position of
the points will lie on these radials and
the intersection of the properly oriented
radial lines determines the position of
the required picture points.
In making a map, some type of map
projection is necessary. Our problem is
to represent on a flat surface a portion
of the earth, which is an oblate spheroid.
The sphere is a non-developable sur-
face; that is, it can not be rolled out or
flattened like a cone or cylinder. Map
projections based on tangent planes,
tangent cones, and tangent cylinders,
which are developable surfaces, are used
to show the meridians and parallels in a
systematic way. The type of projection

GRINDING
By
CECIL SINK, '44E
V\ 7 HEN primitive man found that
"* he could sharpen his crude tools
and weapons by rubbing them against
a piece of stone, he discovered the proc-
ess of grinding, a process that ranks
with the use of fire in its importance to
the development of civilization. Man's
progress began when he discovered that
some stones were better abrasives than
others. Man soon learned that he needed
a stone which possessed a sharp and
even grain and also uniform hardness.
Hardness was an important factor, for if
the stone was too soft it would wear
rapidly, causing coarse and uneven
grinding. However, if it was too hard,
the stone would sometimes glaze and
cut so slowly that it was of little use.
One of the first abrasives man dis-
covered was corundum, a form of alumi-
num oxide. The ancient Egyptians used
corundum to carve their hieroglyphics.
Garnet and emery were two other abra-
sives that were used in those early days.
Many other natural abrasives which
have come into wide use have been dis-
covered since then. However, by 1900,
all of the uses of these various natural
abrasives had been exhausted.
Today natural abrasives are of little
use to modern industry. Mass produc-
tion demands an abrasive that will grind
to a thousandth of an inch and do it rap-
idly. The demands of industry were met
in 1891 for in that year Edward Ache-
son revolutionized the abrasive industry
when he made the first artificial abrasive
in Monongahela City, Pennsylvania.
Acheson wanted to produce a form of
carbon which would approach the dia-
mond in hardness. He started with two
simple facts: the hardness of steel de-
pended somehow on the carbon con-
tent of the steel; and the diamond, the
hardest material known was simply car-
bon in the crystalline form. Carbon
seemed to be the key to hardness.
Acheson found an old plumber's pot
and he put into it a mixture of coke and
clay. He then attached an electric arc to
the pot so that terrific heat would be
generated at the center of the mixture.
The young inventor turned on the cur-
rent and there was a blinding flash and
a puff of smoke. When the smoke had
cleared away, Acheson excitedly exam-
ined the cinderlike mass that was left,
but to his dismay it appeared to be
worthless. As he was about to throw
the fused clinker away, a few bright
specks caught his eye. To his joy he
found that the bright specks were tre-
mendously hard.
Acheson named his product Carborun-
dum and it was later found to be the
simplest compound of silicon and car-
bon. The Carborundum crystals pos-
sessed the beauty of precious stones
and Acheson sold them by the carat at
the equivalent of five hundred and sixty
dollars per pound, but a few months
later the price was down to ten cents
per pound.
In the fifty years which have followed
Acheson's discovery great advancements
have been made in the still new field of
artificial abrasives. Following Carbo-
rundum came Alundum which was made
from bauxite, the ore of aluminum.
Alundum is made by simply fusing the
ore with heat in an electric furnace.
Later, the development of cemented
carbide necessitated the development of
a harder grinding wheel. Cemented Car-
bide made tools of superior hardness and
the tools cut extraordinarily well. How-
ever, tools of this material were difficult
to make and after they were made they
were very difficult to condition because
a suitable grinding wheel was lacking.
Research engineers began work on this
problem and soon produced the diamond
wheel which consisted of crushed dia-
monds in a synthetic resin bond—a bond
being the material which holds the abra-
sive crystals together to form a grinding
wheel. The use of these new wheels
greatly broadened the use of cemented
carbide tools.
Eli Whitney, the inventor of the cot-
ton gin, was the originator of mass
production. He used mass production
methods in making rifles during the War
of 1812. Unfortunately the fruits of his
plan were withheld for almost one hun-
dred years for the simple reason that
until 1900 manufacturers did not have
grinding wheels that would produce the
accurate dimensions that mass produc-
tion requires.
Before the advent of grinding, shafts
and spindles were finished by filing and

heat must be supplied in order to con-
trol the rate of heat loss from the body
so that a feeling of comfort exists. The
conventional method of achieving this
state of comfort is by the use of con-
vection currents of air.
In convection heating, it is usually
the function of the heating medium to
transfer the heat to the air and thence
to the occupant of the room. If the oc-
cupant is to be warm, the surrounding
areas must be warm. With the convec-
tion type of heating, the warm air cur-
rents are circulated and warm the wall
areas of the room by giving off heat en-
ergy to the walls.
This method is exactly the reverse of
radiant heating, of which the primary
object is to warm the surrounding sur-
faces without appreciably heating the
air. This method, too, is based on the
fact that the body is warm only when
the surrounding surfaces are warm. Both
convection and radiant heating systems
are designed for the same purpose,
namely, to keep an individual warm;
and both use the same principle: if the
surrounding areas are warm, the individ-
ual is warm. The difference lies in the
method used to produce these warm sur-
faces.
Radiant heating, as we now consider
it, has been in use about thirty years,
although the Romans first used the
principle at Bath, England, by sending
heated air through the channels in the
floor. The modern development began
in 1907 when Arthur H. Barker, an
English heating engineer, observed that
in his house one of the rooms, which
had a wall warmed by a chimney con-
taining several flues, was noticeably
more comfortable than an adjoining
room, although the air temperatures
were the same. He developed a system
whereby the lower part of the walls was
warmed by hot water pipes embedded in
the construction. He improved this
gradually, with improvements tending

always in the direction of larger heating
surfaces at lower temperatures, away
from the floor and walls and in the di-
rection of the ceiling.
There are now various methods of
applying radiant heating. Pipe coils can
be embedded in the concrete or plaster
of the walls or ceiling, the heating me-
dium being hot water circulating through
the coils. These coils are generally con-
structed of :Vi" pipe spaced about six
inches apart. This warms the entire sur-
face area of a building. The hot water
circulation is maintained by means of a
circulating pump.
Hot water or steam pipes may be
placed under the floor. By this method
the whole floor surface is raised to a
temperature sufficient to give comfort-
able conditions. This method is used
extensively in schools and hospitals
where large quantities of outside air are
desirable. The floor surface may be con-
crete, wood, or any other material un-
affected by heat.
Warm air can be circulated through
shallow ducts under the floor. This
method is quite like the preceding
method, except that warm air is sent
through shallow ducts between the floor
joists, rather than sending water through
pipes.
Electrically heated plates, panels, or
tapestry are sometimes mounted on the
wall. These systems are not often used
as they are quite expensive at the pres-
ent time.
Any of these methods of application
can be installed without special equip-
ment. Most of the equipment used—in-
cluding the heating plant proper, risers,
valves, and controls—is identical with
that employed in conventional methods,
and the remainder is simply a matter of
the structural assembly of ordinary ma-
terials. In a modern home with a con-
crete floor and no basement, the ground
inside the walls is levelled at a depth of
eight inches below the finished floor
level. Four inches of gravel are spread
over this area, and on this gravel the
wrought iron pipes, coated with red lead
paint, are laid. The spacing varies, be-
ing smallest near the walls and gradually
increasing towards the center of the
room. Then four inches of concrete are
placed on the pipes and the floor is
complete. Water is heated in the boiler,
enters the system of pipes, is circulated
by a pump, and returns to the boiler.
Many people think that there would
be a great loss of heat in the ground un-
der a floor of this type. But long expe-
rience has proven this assumption to be
wrong. One example is Professor Brig-
ham's home in Ann Arbor. The ther-
mostat there is set for 65 degrees during
the day. At night the thermostat is shut
off and left off till next morning. The
temperature of the house drops during
the night only two or three degrees, al-
though no heat is applied all night.
A thermostat controls the oil-burn-
ing furnace, and is regulated so as to
keep an even air temperature of 65 de-
grees. When the outside temperature
calls for heat, a valve opens to allow
water to enter the boiler, and the flame
lights under the boiler automatically.
As soon as the air temperature inside
the home reaches 65°, the pump and
flame stop and the water ceases to cir-
culate. The thermostat can be set so as
to allow only a one or two degree varia-
tion in temperature.
The design of such a system of radi-
ant heating is not difficult. For most
purposes, you can merely design a sys-
tem capable of maintaining a room tem-
perature of 65°, figuring heat losses due
to door and window areas, et cetera, in
the ordinary way. The only precau-
tion necessary is to keep the surface
temperature of the floor low enough not
to injure anything.
This method of construction using
radiant heating has many advantages
when compared with conventional types
of heating. Architecturally, it does not
mar or interefere with decorations, takes
little or no space (allowing for more
living and furniture area), and may be
so arranged as to make alterations a
simple matter. Then too, it solves many
heating problems arising from frequently
used entrances, high rooms and large
glass area, as shown in the following
paragraph.
When hot water pipes are placed in
the floor of ceiling, the heat waves given
off radiate vertically. When they reach

Valedictorian of his class. What more

Arthur J. Ceib
was worth the grind of sitting through
the picture.
Since he has been on campus, Art has
been pretty busy in activities outside of
classes. In his freshman year, Art was
a member of Phi Eta Sigma. As a
sophomore, president of the Triangles
and a member of the Union Staff. When
he became a junior, Art was elected to
the Junior Executive Council, became
a member of Tau Beta Pi, and presi-
dent of Wenley House. As a member
of the Vulcans, a member of the Union
Board of Directors, a representative of
the Engineering Council, and steward
and house manager of Theta Delta Chi,
Art is kept pretty busy, even for a
senior.
Basketball and tennis are Art's ma-
jor interests, as far as sports are con-
cerned. He spends most of his spare
time dabbling in photography and
music. His piano-playing is chiefly clas-
sical, but he can give out with a little
boogie-woogie when in the proper mood.
After graduation in February, Art
plans to tuck his B.S.E., Mechanical En-
gineering, under his arm and go right
to work—Uncle Sam willing.

Future WAVE is February graduate
Marie Sinclair. Marie plans to apply for
the campus reserves so that she will be
called to active duty as soon as she has
received her degree. She will probably
go directly into Officer's Candidate
School where her technical training may
be put to the best possible use.
Marie, whose home is in Bloomfield,
New Jersey, has wanted to be an engi-
neer ever since she was ten. The am-
bition developed from her hobby—model
airplanes. She was building them even
at that early age. Because of her desire
to take manual training, Marie caused
quite an uproar when she was in junior
high school. The junior high school
teachers threw up their hands in disgust
and made sarcastic remarks to the effect
that only boys took manual training;
nice little girls were taught to sew and
cook. Our heroine stuck to her guns,
however, and insisted that this nice lit-
tle girl was going to take manual train-
ing. Marie took manual training.
Her name is among those of the char-
ter members of the Society of Women
Engineers, which was formed during her
freshman year on the campus. Marie
has been president of the S.W.E. for the
past two years. She has also an active
interest in A.S.M.E.
The summer following her sophomore
year, she worked at Wright Aeronauti-
cal. "My official title was technical as-
sistant," says Marie. "It sounds like a
lot, but it wasn't anything." Those of
us who are aware of Marie's modesty
and ability to assume responsibility are
inclined to take the last statement with
a grain of salt.
One of the things which Marie enjoys
most is music. If you're at the next

Marie E. Sinclair
concert, look around and you'll be sure
to see her. She doesn't miss a single one
of the Choral Union Series.
When the war is over and Marie is
relieved of her military duties, she plans
to go into aircraft engine development.
We're sure that she'll be one of the
prominent "men" in the field.

It is very seldom that a boy who has
had no previous football experience is
even considered for the varsity football
team, but Bob Derleth is an example of
one of these rare cases. In the Summer

golf and wrestling coach Ray Court-

athletic ability and recommended that
he go out for football. Bob worked
hard and by the Northwestern game he
was ready for his first action as a foot-
ball player. He saw considerable action
for the remainder of the season.
This past season Bob was a welcome
sight when he returned to the team for

left by All-American Merv Pregulman.

homeward trek
There it was just a few more days
until Christmas, and everyone was anxi-
ous (anxious—another way of saying
they haven't slept or studied for three
weeks) to begin a long (for Michigan)
Christmas vacation. To more accurately
understand the place of this important
period in the mind of the average Michi-
gan student, let us delve into this aver-
age mind (for even Michigan students,
medical experts testify, are possessed of
some form of mind, though in many
cases it is purely rudimentary). The
first occasion upon which the average
student seizes to contemplate his forth-
coming sojourn is Thanksgiving. On
this joyous holiday, so graciously given
to the students by the University, the
typical student is thinking of the even
greater vacation to come—that is, when
he does not allow his mind to dwell
upon the Board of Regents. As the days
roll on, their length increases in geo-
metric progression until, at long last,
Santa Claus and vacation are here.
Then the rat race begins. All students
living within a certain radius of Ann Ar-
bor make a supreme effort to get home
in time to get back on time. The others,
who through an unfortunate oversight
on the part of the Board of Regents
are not given time to get home and back,
just watch their friends leave and mut-
ter several unintelligible epithets.
As an example of the first type of
student, let us take the case of Vladi-
mir X , an engineering stu-
dent from East-Cleveland-on-the-Lake,
Ohio, Mr. X not only looks for-
ward to getting home—he looks forward
also to seeing his friends on the way.
When the great day rolls around, our
boy Vladimir tries frantically to get a
taxi to take him to the station before
the Iron Horse Special (one of the more
modern trains—round wheels) pulls out.
He finally gives up and decides to
run. Hoisting his laundry case to his
shoulder, Vladdy, by a superb show of
speed and stamina, manages to arrive
just in time to wait 20 minutes for the
I.H.S. He is consoled however, by the
fact that all his friends are waiting, too.
By the time the train gets there, he has
succeeded in worming his way through
the crowd to a point about 20 feet from
his friends. He is now forced, however,
to turn around and try to worm his way
back to the train. How he does it, Vladi-
mir will never know, but he manages to
step aboard just as the train pulls out.
He looks around for his friends, but
learns they are in a car which has just
been added to the rear of the train.
X starts toward this car,
and, just past Ypsi, manages to reach it.
He then remembers his laundry-case
which he left in the front of the train
but, by the time he gets to it, the train
has arrived in Detroit. He searches
around the station, but, unfortunately, is
unable to find the others before the
I.H.S. leaves. Vladimir's luck is not
much better on the train—going around
a sharp curve the other side of San-
dusky, he catches sight of them in an-
other car, but is subsequently unable
to locate them. Our hero has given up
all hope now, and relaxes in a vain at-
tempt to recuperate. He wore glasses
before his encounter with the masses,
but all he has left now is a glassy stare.
Once in his home town, Vladdy makes a
beeline for the street-car—three gallons
per coupon now, you know—arrives
home, and goes to bed.

II
Vladimir sleeps, unpacks, hangs up
his stockings, takes down his stockings,
and discovers it is time to go back. He
has been unable to see any of his
fiiends—these from Michigan are too
busy, and the others aren't home any-
way. So, to make a long story short.
Vladdy returns to A.A., his return jour-
ney being a repetition of the first, and
arrives wondering if he has really had a
vacation, or whether it was just a fig-
ment of the Board of Regents' ima-
gination.

THE TEAM THAT BUILT A THOUSAND SHIPS
I
N the short space of time since Pearl
10,000-ton Liberty ships have been built
in America's shipyards.
Two things are chiefly responsible for
this epic production achievement: the
resourcefulness of our shipbuilders
and new mass production methods
made possible by the oxyacetylene
flame and the
electric arc.
By wi de-
spread use of

revolutionary pre-fabrication tech-
niques, America's shipbuilders have cre-
ated a gigantic fleet of cargo ships
which are now helping to turn the tide
of war in our favor.
In many other vital fields of indus-
try the oxyacetylene flame and the
electric arc have played equally im-
portant roles. And their proven effi-
ciency and economy in war produc-
tion foreshadows the important place
they will assume in peacetime manu-
facturing.

Bob is more noted for hockey how-

Bob has starred as a sixty minute de-
fenseman. He predicts that this year's

the hope that a decent schedule could

Bob admits that he plays no favorites
between the two sports. We tried to pin
him down but he said, "It's like asking
you who you like best, your mother or
your father."
Bob was born and raised in Mar-
quette, Michigan, in the northern part
of the upper peninsula. He played

Robert J. Derleth
hockey in grade school but played only
basketball in high school. Bob's first
year in college was spent at Northern
Michigan, where he resumed his hockey
career. He transferred here in his second
year and won his numerals with the
freshman hockey team.
In June Bob will join the ranks of
the alumni as a chemical engineer. He
has no definite plans for the future but
indicated that he might apply for an
army commission, otherwise he will
doutbless go into industry.
Here on campus Bob is a former
member of Triangles and is now a mem-

Chuck Dotterer is the type of fellow
you would expect to find hunched over
a battered table in a smoke filled "back
room," Havana cigar in one hand, glass
in the other, muttering to his boys,
"Now look, you'se guys, we gotta carry
every precinct in the twenty-second
ward or the boss will be sore. Then
what will happen to my slot machine
racket"? Even though Chuck doesn't
smoke and his drinking is confined to an
occasional glass of milk at the bell (just
to be one of the boys), we feel sure
that the preceding example of his great
organizational ability is, if anything, a
masterpiece of under-statement. As an
example of the "organizin" to which
Chuck has subjected the campus, we
list (in part) the following activities:
Vulcans, Secretary of Triangle and the
Union, Michiguama, Phi Gamma Delta,
V-Ball committee, and chairman of the
Sophomore and Summer Proms. Chuck
also worked on the last Union Formal
but if the present resentment about the
way the tickets were handled continues,
he probably won't mention that dance
to his granchildren.

Charles Dotterer
A native of Detroit, Chuck was strict-
ly a student in high school, taking time
off from studies only long enough to
earn a little spending money. He fol-
lowed the same plan during his fresh-
man year on campus. After two semes-
ters of diligent study, Chuck examined
his grade cards and screamed "Extra-
curricular activities for me." As a re-
sult, his grades have been about the
same and he has gained, in addition,
much valuable experience. Chuck also
supports those who plead that the Mich-
igan engineer should "lay his slide rule
down," and get out and see how the
other half lives.
We feel that Chuck will go far in the
automobile industry. Down through the
years, he has accumulated a huge trunk
full of automobile catalogues and sales
literature and he has a burning desire
to work in the sales portion of the De-
troit auto industry. Failing in that.
Chuck admits that he might try his
hand at politics.

high and far . . . and hit hard. It needs ships in great
numbers. It needs tanks I li.it can take it when the going
gets tough. It needs equipment to outperform any on
earth. All these things require many special steels. Such
Bteels with needed properties are created through the
use of alloys. Basic peacetime research by ELECTRO
METALLURGICAL COMPANY, a Unit of UCC, has devel-
oped many important steels and the alloys to make them,
MII li as chromium, silicon, manganese, vanadium, lung-
glen, calcium, and columbium ... all vital today.
* 1!
2. STAINLESS STEELS! The development of steels of high
chromium content gave designers and engineers a whole
family of new materials with which to work. Such steels
resist rust and corrosion, and are easily kept clean. They
are essential in the food industry. Possessing great
strength in addition to their corrosion resistance, thry
save weight in trains and planes. They have brought
improvements in the oil. chemical, textile, and oilier
fields...with resultant savings to you. Low-carbon ferro-
chromium, an Electromet development, is essential in
the large-scale production of stainless steels.

3. NEW NATIONAL RESOURCES! Tnnp-l.-n and vanadi.
um are essential to steelmakers. Long before war clouds
loomed, many felt that more of this country's domestic
sources of these metals should be developed. Engineer-
ing research by UNITED STATES VANADIUM CORPORA-
TION, another UCC Unit, found efficient ways of refining
low-grade ores. This enabled U. S. VANADIUM to revital-
ize old mines with new mills and methods, and make
America less dependent on foreign sources for her in-
creased needs of tungsten and vanadium.

4. BUILDING TOWARDS THE FUTURE! Alloy steels
offer still greater promise for the future. Bridges and
other structures will be made still lighter, stronger, and
longer-lasting by wider use of some of the steels with
which engineers are already experienced. Trains, trucks,
and aircraft will be made lighter, stronger, faster, and
safer. Better cars and tractors, homes and home equip-
ment will be made through their use.
Units of L'C.C do not make steel. They do make ferro-alloys used
to purify and $itv special properties to sleeL They also make non-
ferrous alloys ti In, it. hecause of their exceptional resistance to
wear, heat, and corrosion, are used as cutting tools, hard-facing
uvldinft rods, and for other purposes. U('(* research and develop-
ments mean ever-net? and improved alloys for industry . . . and

by polishing with oil and emery. This
method gave little assurance of dimen-
sional accuracy because it was essen-
tially handwork and the operator fre-
quently erred. Grinding solves the prob-
lem of accuracy. An accurately dimen-
sioned part is of primary importance in
modern industry. Today, with synthetic
abrasives, tolerances bf a twenty thous-
andth of an inch can be obtained in
thousands of parts with the same ma-
chine. The abrasive is so hard that
wear on the grinding wheel is negligi-
ble over relatively long periods of time
and little adjustment or care is needed.
A fine and accurate finish is especially
needed in the present day high speed
engine because a part with a rough finish
will of course wear away much faster
than a smooth one. Thus, fine finishing
will give a motor longer piston ring life,
and will help eliminate vibration. Al-
together there are from three to four
hundred grinding operations in the
manufacture of an automobile. The
difference in the quality of a Ford and a
Cadillac is the accuracy ground into the
parts. Arthur Pound has said that, "The
automobile industry, dependent for its
amazing advances upon complete inter-
changeability of machined parts, could
hardly have reached its present volume,
but for the steady increase in accuracy
at low cost made possible by the grind-
ing machine."
Our modern grinding machines can di-
vide a human hair thirty times. Such
accuracy is a development of the last
ten years. Grinding machines are used
for everything from making the slit in
a fountain pen point to grinding the pulp
for modern newsprint. Besides produc-
ing a high degree of accuracy, grinding
is fast and cheap. In the early days of
artificial abrasives, grinding was used
for sharpening tools and strictly for fin-
ishing work, but today the grinding
wheel is used as a production machine.
An abrasive wheel can cut through a
tough steel bar an inch in diameter in a
matter of a few seconds, and today saw-
ing steel and even softer metals is one of
the more important uses of artificial
abrasives because it saves time and
money. Sawing steel with an abrasive
wheel is twenty times as fast as the old
method of using a power hack saw.
Sawing with an abrasive wheel has the
added advantage of leaving a smooth
surface after cutting. This feature elimi-
nates some of the cost of finishing the
piece. Some manufacturers have re-
ported savings of from sixty-five to
eighty-five per cent by using abrasives
for production work.
The new diamond wheels have saved
a great deal of labor and have lowered
the cost of tools by saving scrapped
tools. For example, twelve piston groov-
ing tools were ground in twelve minutes
by using a diamond wheel, whereas it
required six hours with the Carborun-
dum formerly used.
Research is still going on in the arti-
ficial abrasive industry, for although ad-
vances are constantly being made, there
is still a wide gap between the hardness
of Carborundum and the hardness of a
pure diamond. The fruits of this re-
search can be seen throughout our coun-
try. For example, not so long ago mo-
tor bearings had to be overhauled every
fifteen thousand miles, but now, through
accurate abrasive finishing, motor bear-
ings will last a lifetime. The present
war has brought about even more aston-
ishing achievements. One year ago our
best airplane motors had to be torn
down and completely overhauled after
every two hundred hours of use, but
now, to the astonishment of British and
Germans, the best American motors will
run one thousand hours because of the
use of new and better abrasives.
The widespread effect of the artificial
abrasives used in grinding wheels is
summarized in Arthur Pound's state-
ment, "No machine development of the
past century has effected more pro-
foundly the efficiency of manufactured
goods and through them the way of life
of the people." Grinding has produced
low cost and quality in manufactured
goods. It is difficult to imagine what
life would be like if the process of grind-
ing had never developed. Walter Hol-
brook gives us a rather vivid picture of
such a life when he says, "Without the
art of grinding, man would be reduced
to living on fruits, nuts, roots, and veg-
etation growing wild, and on what meat
he could snare or club, since grinding is
necessary to shape and sharpen even the
crudest tools and weapons. . .He would
live in a hut or cave. .. .All modern
transportation and machine operation is
based on the wheel and without grinding
he could not have even a wooden wheel.
Grinding thus ranks with the use of
fire as one of the arts upon which civili-
zation rest."

has exploded the German chemical myth
This is the Chemical Age and many people believe that
Germany is the chemical nation. Yet history shows that
the synthetic organic chemical industry really started in
England, got much of its early impetus in France and has
reached its greatest development right here in America.
Germany undoubtedly contributed vast research . . .
and vast propaganda . . . but she made the mistake of
trying to make it a German monopoly, through Govern-
ment subsidies and control. There is a profound lesson for
us in that.
The American chemical industry, operating on private
capital, has pulled out of the test tube miraculous new
medicines to save life, super-powerful explosives to over-
throw dictators, marvelous new materials that Nature
never dreamed of. America now has the greatest organic
chemical industry in the world.
Koppers is one of the great raw materials sources for
the chemical industry. Coal tar chemicals go into the
new explosives, into the new wonder-working medicines,
into the new plastics, into more productive agriculture.
Koppers is the largest builder of coke ovens, in which
coal is processed to yield raw materials for the coal tar
chemical industry... it is one of the largest producers and
distillers of coal tar ... one of the foremost designers and
builders of recovery plants from which come the materials
for use in medicines, explosives, plastics, synthetic
vitamins, synthetic rubber and other chemical wonders.
An affiliate of Koppers is one of the largest independent
coal producers in America.—Koppers Company, Koppers

At one time the warping of wood due to
changing moisture content caused much
damage to airplanes. At present, owing
to various waterproofing processes, the
change in moisture content is very slow,
if present at all. It is so slight as to be
negligible in its effect on the general
structure of the plane.
Because of its new use as plywood,
wood is returning to favor. Plywood is
just what the name suggests, several
layers of wood held together to form
one thicker layer. To understand why
plywood is so efficient a material, some-
thing must be known of its construc-
tion. Plywood is made up of from two
to thirty thin sheets of wood lying with
their grains at right angles to one an-
other. This idea of having the individ-
ual slices at right angles to one another
is the secret of its superior qualities.
Ordinarily, if wood is attacked by mois-
ture, it will expand six times as much
across the grain as with it. When sev-
eral similar layers of wood are firmly
bonded together by a good glue, they
tend to counteract each other's move-
ments. Also, plywood is stronger than
an ordinary piece of good of equal di-
mensions. The grains being at right
angles so dispose the strain that no lo-
cale is unduly stressed in relation to the
whole board. In an ordinary board the
force on it tends to concentrate in some
flaw and thus destroy the board.
There are many uses of plywood, the
most important of which is wing cover-
ing. As mentioned before, the original
idea was to cover the wooden framework
with canvas. But canvas is too frail, so
someone thought of using extremely
thin plywood in place of the canvas. It
was found that when the plywood ap-
proached the weight of the canvas, it
became more delicate than the cloth. A
solution was finally reached. The ply-
wood was made fairly thick, and some
of the internal construction of the wing
was removed. Thus the weight was kept
the same as with canvas, but because of
the superior strength of the sheet ply-
wood, the wing was now considerably
stronger.
By a new process, plywood can be
molded into any shape within reason.
The process invokes molds, steam, and
rubber bags. The plywood is steamed
until pliable, placed over the desired
mold, and the bag inflated to force the
plywood into the mold. By this method
the whole fuselage of a plane can be
molded in two pieces.
In planes of the cargo carrier type,
plywood is used extensively. Great
strength and light weight are needed in
the wings of a large plane, and plywood
has both of these properties.
Plywood has many advantages over
the thin metals used in all metal con-
struction. For one thing, a plane made
of plywood can be patched up by any
person who has a little ingenuity. Alum-
inum takes a skilled, highly trained la-
borer to obtain the same results. Two.
plywood has a greater strength per unit
weight ratio (in thin sections). The
stiffness of plywood per unit weight is
eighteen times that of thin aluminum.
This means that plywood will not buckle
and wrinkle as aluminum has a tendency
to do. Plywood gives better airfoil sur-
faces than the metals. The metals must
be overlapped and riveted. These laps
and rivets offer air resistance. Plywood
is built with the sections beveled into
each other with flush fastenings. Also to
be considered is the fact that much
time and material is lost by ruining
metal during riveting. When plywood is
used, this problem is non-existent.
the area opposite their source, they are
reflected, and the reflection recurs again
and again. This assures a uniform tem-
perature from floor to ceiling, and allows
greater glass area without danger of de-
creasing temperature, because the heat
waves travel vertically. In convection
heating, large glass areas are impracti-
cal, since the heat currents travel
around the room in a circular motion
from the floor to the ceiling, and thus
strike any cold glass area and lose heat.
In England, by using radiant heating
in schools, one whole side of each room
is left open to the fresh air, and students
sitting near this open area are just as
comfortable as those near the inside
wall. But there are other important ad-
vantages.
Radiant heating is more comfortable
and more healthful; comfortable be-
cause of the uniform air and tempera-
ture throughout the heated space, ab-
sence from drafts and easier ventilation
there are no air currents with radiant
heating); healthful because of the re-
duced contrast between outdoor and in-
Radiant- Heating
(continued from page IS)
door temperatures, higher humidity, and
cooler, cleaner air for breathing.
The reduced air temperature is made
possible because radiant heat waves af-
fect the comfort of the body more read-
ily than air temperature does. With
convection heating, the air temperature
must be 70 to 72 degrees, whereas a ra-
diant heating system gives the same
comfort at 64 to 66 degrees. This lower
temperature furnishes another advan-
tage of radiant heating. There is a sav-
ing in fuel consumption because of these
different temperatures, and because the
heating medium holds heat better than
the heating medium used in convection
heating. The average fuel saving is
about one-third, which easily balances
the possible extra initial cost.
One advantage of radiant heating is
that in the hot summer months, cold
water can be circulated through the
pipes, keeping the temperature of the
home at 65 degrees. And still another
very important phase of radiant heating
is its great advantage over convection
heating in industrial design. In factor-
ies where a static spark or metal to
metal contact might cause an explosion,
radiant heating eliminates a dangerous
hazard, because no metal parts are ex-
posed. This also means that walls,
floors, and ceilings can be made com-
pletely smooth, leaving these areas free
of piping and heating units. There is
nothing to interfere with material flow-
by crane or truck, or with equipment
placement. In close-tolerance finishing
operations, "spotty" heating may in-
crease rejects. Radiant heating dis-
tributes its warmth uniformly over an
entire area.
With all these formidable claims the
surprising thing is that radiant heating
is not more in use at the present time.
For this, two reasons are commonly
cited. (1) "The American climate is
too severe." (2) "The advance is ob-
structed by the lack of equipment." But
the real reason seems to be the inertia
of an established way of doing things.
Facts show that climate has no effect
on radiant heating and it requires no
special equipment.

CAUSTIC SODA-a key chemical In Industrial growth
Caustic Soda is an indispensable chemical
needed by industry in huge quantities. A long
list of products—notably petroleum, soap,
paper and textiles—use it as an essential mate-
rial in various manufacturing processes. The
production and availability of this hard-work-
ing chemical are consequently of genuine
importance.
Following the course dictated by its own initia-
tive, Dow began many years ago to specialize,
step by step, in the chemistry of brine. Original
methods for the production of bromine led to
chlorine, and the process for making chlorine
produced caustic soda as a co-product. During
the intervening years, Dow has become one of
the leading producers of this key chemical,
with plants so strategically located that they are
prepared to serve the entire nation.
This development is cited merely to emphasize
the importance of self-reliant enterprise.

chosen depends on the purpose for which
the map is made, and for aerial map-
ping, the polyconic projection is gener-
ally used. When the lines representing
latitude and longitude have been drawn
on the map sheet, the geodetic position
of ground control stations can be
plotted. These same ground control
stations are located on the photograph,
and if radial lines are drawn through
their image points similar to those al-
ready mentioned, the true image points
will lie somewhere on these radials.
Since the ground control points are defi-
nitely located on the map sheet, they
form a basis for the extension of con-
trol through the radial line method. If
the terrain is not too rough, six picture
points, three on the right and three on
the left side of the photograph, in addi-
tion to the center and overlapping cen-
ters of adjacent photographs will give
sufficient control for compilation of the
photographic detail.
The extension of control through the
radial line method may be carried out
with the aid of a transparent sheet or
by slotted templets. The latter has the
advantage that fewer ground control sta-
tions are required. While not done in
practice, the radial intersection method
can be demonstrated by using the actual
photograph as templets. Radial slots
are cut in the photograph and special
studs inserted through the slots into the
map sheet. Figure 4 shows a portion of
the map sheet with geographic grid and
the positions of the ground control sta-
tions. In this case it will be necessary to
fix in its proper position the center of
one of the photographs. This requires
at least three properly spaced ground
control points, A, B, and C on the con-
trol plot. If radial slots are cut through
the image points of A, B. and C on the
photograph and these slots slipped over
the studs fastened on the control sheet,
the principal point will be in its proper
position and may be pricked through
on the control sheet. On the adjacent
picture, control point C does not appear
on the overlap, but P 1 is now a fixed
point, and with A and B we have the
three points necessary to fix the center
of the second photograph. The distance
between these centers is the air base or
distance between stations. Additional
radial lines on the photographs to pic-
ture control points can now be properly
oriented. Using the intersections of
these radials with the picture points, the
work can be carried on until other
ground control points are reached. The
radial intersections are pricked on the
map and serve as points for adjusting
the photographs to the map scale. All
ground control and picture control
points can now be transferred to a trans-
parent sheet such as matte surfaced
acetate, which has a very low coeffi-

Figure 5
cient of expansion. Each photograph is
then placed under the sheet and ad-
justed to the control while taking off
the planimetry. A more convenient way
of transferring the photographic detail
to the control sheet is by the use of the
Master Sketch Maker which is shown in
Figure 5. The instrument is simple in
principle, being a means of superim-
posing the photo image on the map
sheet. A mirror set above the photo-
graph at an angle of 45° reflects the
image to a small parallel mirror. This
mirror is semi-transparent. The instru-
ment is monocular, and when the eye is
placed above the small mirror, one sees
the photograph with its control points
superimposed (when properly adjusted
for scale and tilt) on the corresponding
control points on the map. Thus we can
trace the detail from the photograph on
the acetate control sheet. The instru-
ment is capable of changing the scale to
a half reduction or to a one and one-
half times enlargement.
The aerial photograph gives a wealth
of detail, but the names of roads,
streams, and political boundaries must
be determined from existing maps or
field trips. With special equipment, con-
tours can be drawn on the map. More-
over, the radial control furnishes the in-
formation necessary to determine scale
and tilt, and rectified prints can be
made which are fitted to the control.
This is called a controlled mosaic. Since
it is difficult to compute direction and
distance from a geographic grid, the rec-
tangular or military grid is placed on
all maps and mosaics used for military
purposes.
Photogrammetry, or making maps
from aerial photographs, is a rather
new and rapidly changing science. New
types of equipment are being developed,
as well as new methods. The great ad-
vantage of aerial photographs in map-
ping is speed, which is an important
factor in time of war. But any enter-
prise to be useful to mankind must be
useful in times of peace as well as in
war, and there is little doubt that aerial
photographs will be used as an aid in
making practically all future maps.

STEEL CUTTING PRODUCTION
of the United Nations
IN CANADA

IN CHIN AI
IN INDIA!
WITH the outbreak of war in 1939, the Allied
Nations—abruptly cut off from Germany as
a principal source of supply for carbides—diverted
the full flood of their carbide demands to the
United States.
Fortunately, American industry had established
—as far back as 1928—its own independent sources
of supply. These American suppliers were ready to
meet the emergency with a background of 10 years'
experience in the development, manufacture and
application of this urgently needed material. They
had the skill, the equipment, and a generous margin
of reserve capacity.
To the hard pressed Allied Nations—struggling
to offset the tremendous output of a German war
production long since tooled with carbide by
official decree—went tons of American carbides
in steadily increasing quantities. Foresight and
preparedness enabled American carbide manufac-
turers to fill this urgent need and at the same time
meet the pyramiding demands of domestic
industries.
Today, you will find carbides a factor of vital
importance in stepping up and keeping up the pro-
duction of not only the United States but also such
countries as England, Russia, Australia, Canada,
China, India, Mexico and many others among the
United Nations.
The full extent to which carbides are being used
in the cause of victory is difficult to visualize.
Carboloy Company production alone, for example,
is at an annual rate 45 times greater than that of
any pre-war year. Monthly production of carbides
—formerly measured in pounds—can today be
expressed in tons—many tons per month! Yet the
average carbide tool contains but a fraction of an
ounce of carbide at the cutting edge—and a single
tool during its usable life machines hundreds of
parts for the implements of war. Particularly im-
portant is the use of carbides for cutting steel—
a major field of use for Carboloy tools. (More than
60% of the Carboloy Cemented Carbide produced
today for machining purposes is for cutting steel.)
A high order of performance—so high as to have
been once considered incredible—is now commonly
expected, and obtained, with carbides. Such things
as increases in output of 3 to 1, lengthened tool
life of 10 to 1, finish cuts that eliminate arduous
grinding, machining of former "non-machineable"
alloys, reductions of 25%, 50%, 75% in machining
costs—results such as these are every-day occur-
rences in war production today.
This widespread use of carbides in war, indicates
a new era of production economy when normal
commerce returns. Manufacturers who have con-
verted to carbides to meet the present emergency
will then have at their immediate disposal an
economic weapon of unusual advantage in seeking
world markets.

GIVE THEM A CHANCE
V\ TILL the engineering student
be allowed to finish his edu-
cation? A year ago this question was
uppermost in all of our minds. Now
in the eyes of most of the leading
men in the country, this question has
been reasonably well settled. It has
been decided that those men who
can complete their education by July
1945 will be allowed to remain in
school. Does this mean no engineer-
ing student will be drafted before
July 194S? Of course the student will
be required to maintain an average
such that he will be in good standing,
but what will happen to the fellow
who can finish only by taking a very
heavy schedule? Should he be en-
couraged to do so?
Before the war it was uncommon
for a student to classify for more
than eighteen hours credit. This was
thought to be the maximum load that
a student could handle most efficient-
ly. Today, however, it is quite com-
mon for a student to carry twenty
hours credit. In fact, it is unusual
for him to carry less than eighteen.
Now the real question arises; should
he be given a chance to carry the
heavier load and remain in school?
Or, on the other hand, should the
school officials force him to lower his
class schedule and thereby send a
potential engineer—the type of man
that industry and the armed services
need badly, into the army as a pri-
vate, where a majority of his talents
will go to waste?
It seems to be the opinion of one
member of the Engineering College
Administration that the number of
credit hours for which a student may
classify should be determined by the
regulations set up during peace time.
In one particular case, a student went
to this member of the administration
to ask him if he would write a letter
to the student's draft board stating
that he would be able to graduate by
July 1945. The student, in order to
graduate by this date, had been al-
lowed to classify with twenty hours
credit. When the administrative of-
ficial discovered this, he insisted that
the student go to his classifier and
drop a course before any letter would
be written—thereby insisting that the
student be drafted because he would
not have a chance to graduate by the
deadline set by the draft officials. He
seemed to be afraid that the College
of Engineering would become a
"haven for draft dodgers."
The student had to go to the head
of his department and his classifier,
both of whom agreed that a student
should be allowed to do anything that
might enable him to graduate by July
1945. After considerable wrangling,
these two faculty members were able
to convince the administrative official
that this student should be allowed
to carry his original schedule. But
what will happen the next time this
problem arises? The best answer to
that question is that it should never
arise.
Everyone on the Engineering Col-
lege faculty, except an administrative
official, seems to be willing to give any
student a chance to prove himself—
a chance to prove that he belongs in
the Engineering College and not in
the draft. There are students in the
Engineering College who deserve the
right to obtain an Engineering De-
gree, but it will be beyond their grasp
if they are not given a chance to prove
their ability. Why not give them a
chance? If they should fail to pass,
they will be grateful that they were
given the chance to try, whereas if
not given a chance the students will
be bitter. Give them a chance! People
will admire those who succeed much
more than they normally would.
Michigan will not become a "haven
for draft dodgers." Instead it will
retain the reputation it now possesses,
and the quality of its graduates will
remain at the present high level.

On September 5th, 1942, our Mine and Mill at
Climax, our Research Laboratory at Detroit and
our Conversion Plant at Langeloth, Pennsylvania,
were given the Army-Navy Production Award.
Since then the award has been twice renewed.
The two-starred flag we fly represents a full year
of contribution to the war effort recognized by the
Army and Navy.
Winning the award by the laboratory began in
1931. It was then that it was founded to meet our
needs for authoritative information about molyb-
denum—containing ferrous materials.
Pearl Harbor intensified our work with pro-
ducers of war equipment—work that is aided con-
siderably by the accumulated data and experience
gained in over ten years of concentrated research.
We are particularly proud to be among those

. .. Rockets are now replacing sounding
balloons as carriers for meteorological
instruments. The high percentage of
losses, as well as limitations on the maxi-
mum altitude of the latter make them
unsatisfactory for accurate work. Bal-
loons are intended to rise until they
burst, whereupon the recording instru-
ments are lowered by parachute. How-
ever, the drift to which the devices are
subject, in the ascent as well as descent,
and the impracticability of launching
them on days of zero visibility when the
data is needed most, are definite draw-
backs.
The gasoline-powered rocket ap-
pears to be the answer to most of these
difficulties. It's maximum altitude,
which can be adjusted very closely by
means of the fuel supply, is about 25
miles. Compared with the record alti-
tude of 22 miles for sounding balloons
this may not seem unusual, but the bal-
loons seldom reach this mark, usually
bursting at about six miles above the
Earth's surface. Since modern aircraft
frequently exceed this altitude, data on
weather conditions cannot be very com-
plete.
Recent experimental rockets weigh
about fifty pounds and are approxi-
mately four inches in diameter. Oxygen
as well as fuel is carried, and a para-
chute in the tail lowers rocket and in-
struments safely to the ground after
the fuel is exhausted. The device is
not yet ready for wide-scale use, but it
promises great improvements in the field
of weather-predicting in the years to
come.
. .. Rejuvenation of an obsolete bridge
was recently accomplished by replacing
the old heavy steel floor with an alumi-
num structure. The saving in dead load
of about 750 tons, or one ton per foot of
span, allowed the fifty-year-old span to
be opened to war traffic, thus saving
vital materials for the war effort and
lanes.

tions, according to the latest Govern-
ment figures. Also holding the largest
quantity of war contracts, in all fields,
the state can now brag about something
besides the University football team.
. . . Mass production of farm tractors
has been resumed in the plant of a Dear-
born Ford affiliate. This particular
company had never been converted to
war work, but relaxation of WPB re-
strictions now permits an output of 150
tractors per day. Having been closed
since the beginning of the war, the or-
ganization was only recently put into
operation, to supply the huge demand
for farm implements which, it is esti-
mated, will tax the facilities of the en-
tire industry for two years after the end
of the war.
. . . Grover Loening, one of the pioneers
of the aviation industry and helicopter
expert for the National Aeronautics Ad-
visory Board, states that the widely-
heralded helicopter will not come into
widespread use as a family flivver for
at least five or ten years after the war.
The difficulty lies in the coordination
of five separate controls necessary for
handling the craft. This contradicts th?
information emanating from the Sikor-
sky organization, which implies that
the machine is simple to operate and
easy to master.
However, anyone who can remember
the days when he was learning to drive
a car will testify that it was no snap.
Any such machine requires concentrated
effort and long practice in order to un-
derstand it, but you will agree that it's
worth the trouble. No doubt the heli-
copter will not become a universally-
adopted conveyance overnight, but pub-
lic interest in it will be strong after the
war, and we can expect to see it devel-
oped rapidly.
. .. Invasion craft are now being put at
the head of the priorities list. Aircraft,
ordnance, and all other urgent necessi-
ties are being somewhat sidetracked
(not, of course, on a large scale) to the
barges, which will be turned out by
four thousand contractors.

... Purification of coke-oven gas, to
prevent the rapid corrosion of appara-

by the Ford River Rouge plant. The
production of sulfur as a by-product is
interesting, but unimportant compared
to the saving in manufacturing equip-
ment which results. The sulfur is in the
form of hydrogen sulfide, which attacks
the nickelchrome steel rails, trays, and
retorts very vigorously at high tem-
peratures.
The plant is unusual in that only two
skilled men are required for it's opera-
tion. The apparatus used consists of
coolers, absorption tanks, "thionizers,"
and filtering tanks. The coke-oven gas
is reduced in temperature in the first
unit from 110 degrees to about 75. Then
it passes through a thylox solution,
which absorbs the hydrogen sulfide,
leaving the gas 97% free of it. In the
thionizing tanks the "fouled" thylox is
treated with oxygen, which converts the
sulfur to a solid, although it is still in
solution. Finally, it is filtered out, dis-
tilled, and then either bagged in flakes
or molded into solid blocks of about half
a cubic foot.

discounted rumors of dangerous crude
oil shortages, saying that although new
oil-rich areas are not being discovered
very rapidly, extension of known fields
is progressing continuously. They state
that the figures produced by "alarmists"

parently such "scares of scarcity" have
been common in the past forty years,
but they have always been alleviated by
new "strikes." Don't get optimistic too

JOE JENKS

f / OSEPH JENKS labored for immediate results rather than distant glory
(J when he made the dies for America's first coin, the "pine tree shilling",
but he did much more than that.
This is the 300th year for the clumsy, crude, cooking pot which Joe Jenks
designed and pulled from his sand mold and which still exists, the prized
possession of the Hudson family in Lynn, Massachusetts. That pot is the
first iron product made in America. Of American iron, it is the first product
of America's first successful blast furnace. It is a pot full of American firsts.
It was in 1644, on a bank of the Saugus river midway between Salem and
Boston, in Massachusetts Bay Colony, that "a guy named Joe" produced this
three pound pot that boiled over, in 1943, into more than one hundred mil-
lion tons of steel, a single year's output of the world's largest enterprise,
the American steel industry. Last year, the American iron and steel industry
employed over 625,000 men and women, and, with these men and women,
paid over $700,000,000 in taxes. These steel-workers, with the steel and taxes
to make more steel, are a main reliance of those other men and women who,
on foreign battle fronts, are giving all to preserve a way of life that is its
own reward.
With understandable pride, The Harrisburg Steel Corporation, with
over ninety years of know-how in steelmaking, is producing in ever-increas-
ing volume products of war and will continue to produce in the coming
days of peace seamless and drop forged steel products that include seamless
steel cylinders, liquefiers, pump liners, couplings, drop forged steel flanges,
coils and bends and other products to the specifications of customers who
range from the smallest to the largest user.

. .. Beer production in Michigan is up
8.89' over last year, it was announced
recently. This is due to increased Gov-
ernment allotments of corn and other
necessary ingredients, although brewers
are faced with new restrictions on mate-
rials for bottles and packing cases. The
drought which disrupted campus life
this summer was a temporary affair, and
was due mostly to the large demand
which accompanied the hot weather.
Federal authorities swear that prices
have not gone up, but have they checked

ing the oncoming traffic.
... In the realm of the sensational and
futuristic, Goodyear predicts that post-
war homes will feature such innovations
as flexible water pipes, window screens

... There has recently been invented
a new way of locating pieces of metal
in a persons body. It only requires a
few minutes, as compared with the old
method of using X-rays and probes,
which often requires an hour or more.
The new instrument was used for the
first time at Pearl Harbor, and on the
morning of the attack was used suc-
cessfully in locating fragments in twen-
ty cases.
The finder consists of a radio fre-
quency circuit mounted in a box, with
a movable coil attached by wire and
inclosed in a small finger. The finger,
about one foot long and half an inch
in diameter, is water tight and the wire
to which it is connected is covered with
rubber so they may be detached and
sterilized.
The indicator is passed above and
around the fragment in two planes at
right angles to each other. At the
points of greatest deflection, marks are
made on the flesh, and when projected,
their intersection indicates the location
of the metal fragment. If it should be
necessary, the finger can be introduced
into the wound, even into the lung,
brain, or abdomen.

JEAN CARPENTER, '45E
"DOURTEEN years ago a woman sat
•L under blinding lights in John L.
Baird's television studio in London while
a group of men, assembled around a re-
ceiver in Hartsdale, New York, saw her
face on a screen.
That radio transmission of a moving
picture across 3,000 miles of ocean led
many to believe that television, a new
twentieth century wonder, was about to
round the corner and, like radio, enter
most American homes. But years passed
and nothing of this sort happened. Peo-
ple still are asking, "When will we
have television?"
There are three different answers to
this question, all of them true. We have
television right now—as a laboratory
accomplishment. We have it also in the
home—but it is limited to the homes of
a few experimenters living within a few
miles of a few stations. As far as the
public is concerned, we do not have it
at all, and no one knows even now when
it will be ready for the general public.
Indeed it might appear to the layman
that television has moved backward, in-
stead of forward, since 1928. Baird's
historic telecast spanned an ocean, but
the pictures which you may see eventu-
ally in your home probably will come
from a transmitter, the effective range
of which will be limited to the horizon
line—twenty to fifty miles, depending
on the height of the antenna.
If a 3,000-mile telecast was possible
ten years ago, why are telecasts now
limited to fifty miles? There are several
reasons.
Clearer pictures are being transmitted
over short waves, instead of long ones.
If a wide band of long wave frequencies
were available, and if weather and other
conditions were always favorable, the
range of good television signals would
be sufficient to transmit a low-definition
picture clear around the globe!
But to transmit a picture of high defi-
nition by short wave and under varying
conditions, the dependable radius of a
single transmitter has been found to be
limited to the horizon—about as far as
one can see. To send a program beyond
the horizon without fear of failure, two
or more transmitters must be connected
by co-axial cable, the only known me-'
tallic conductor which can be used for
telecasting.
However, co-axial cable, capable of
conducting frequencies as high as 1,000
kilocycles or of carrying 200 telephone
conversations at once, is expensive. But
co-axial cable connection is still inade-
quate for modern high-definition tele-
vision transmission. One such circuit
now connects New York and Philadel-

phia, but it will cost millions of dollars
to criss-cross the country with co-axial
cables and link many transmitters to-
gether. Until this has been done, how-
ever, there can be no chain tele-
vision transmission like radio broad-
casts, which go out to a network of sta-
tions from a central point.
Also, a television transmitter costs
more to buy and to operate than a radio
station of comparable quality. And even
after these costly transmitters are built
and linked together by a co-axial cable,
only those living within a radius of ap-
proximately fifty miles of the transmit-
ters will be able to receive broadcasts.
A television receiver is much more
complicated than a sound receiver be-
cause it must be exactly in step with the
transmitter to the millionth part of a
second or there will be no picture!
"Video," as television will soon be
known, is a system of syncronizing and
harmonizing many vital parts. If receiv-
ers and transmitters do not fit, as a key
fits a lock, the system cannot function.
Despite the rather gloomy outlook for
television for the masses in the immedi-
ate future, notable advances in the field
have been made in recent years. One of
the most important was Dr. Vladimer
Zworykin's invention of electronic scan-
ning, which reduced the time required
for the instrument to scan the scene.
This was one of the big problems in
television, but was of no importance in
sound broadcasting .
Arthur Van Dyke of R.C.A. points
out that in sound broadcasting, only
one sound is transmitted at a time, and
this sound, even if it is a complex one,
can be represented by one electric cur-
rent. But no picture can be represented
by one current because it is composed
of many elements. If you look at a
scene ten feet square from a distance at
which the eye can see objects one inch
in diameter, there are 15,000 one square
inch areas, which you must to describe
to convey the exact scene to someone
else.
Given unlimited time, you might do

IANUARY, 1944

COL. HENRYW. MILLER
Chairman of the Department of Mechanism and Engineering Drawing

Col. Miller
It is doubtful if any previous war
saw so much talking about secret weap-
ons as this one. On one memorable oc-
casion, Adolph Hitler told the Nazi
party in one of its monstrous get-togeth-
ers that Germany had a secret weapon
which only she could use—others could
not ever use it. Ever since that time we
have speculated as to whether he was
bluffing or whether he was referring to
something in particular. In the Science
of Warfare, one of the four main fac-
tors to be considered is the disconcer-
tion produced by terror or by surprise.
It is always to the point therefore, to
threaten your enemies with dire things
and to pretend that you have secret de-
vices, whether you have or not. Some
effect is always produced.
Some have thought that the secret to
which Hitler referred was the iron grip
which the Nazi party or organization
had acquired over the whole of Germany
and the indoctrination of all of the
young people in Germany with the so-
called ideas of Nazism. Admittedly this
could not be done in any other country
and if that constituted a factor or power
that could be used effectively in war-
fare, they really had something. To
date, they have not really produced any-
thing that justifies the name of a secret
weapon. They produced a magnetic
mine which occasioned a great deal of
concern for a while until physicists
found how to neutralize it. They have
produced new things in their submarines
that have made them more effective.
They have recently produced some
rocket projectiles fired from special
guns on their airplanes. We are given to
believe that they have produced some
radio controlled air bombs and radio
controlled submarine torpedoes. There
seems to be no positive confirmation of
this but perhaps we should take it at
face value.
For the last two months we have been
bombarded from Germany with threats
of terrible retribution that is to be ex-
acted from the nearest of the Allied
Nations, that is, Britain apparently, or
perhaps Britain and Russia. Recently,
the threat has again been broadcast
that they have a secret weapon or
method of wreaking such vengeance on
their opponents that the world will be
appalled. They even state that it may
be possible to wreck half the globe with
some new power. Again it may be only
a bluff. Probably the power of what-
ever they have, if they have anything,
is greatly exaggerated, because they
have nothing to lose by exaggerating,
just as apparently the Japanese have
nothing to lose by sinking our entire
Pacific fleet one time after another.
As one scans the whole field of possi-
bilities of powerful weapons that might
be used in warfare, it is true that only
something of a truly revolutionary
character can really classify as a power-
ful secret device or weapon. Newly con-
trived mechanisms will serve only for
a time, but fundamentally new and rev-
olutionary methods of wreaking destruc-
tion might cause tremendous havoc
and there might be no way of neutraliz-
ing them. We have had a few such rev-
olutionary discoveries in recent times.
One is the group of sulfa drugs which
seems to inhibit the chemical combina-
tion of the elements in the human body
into large protein virus molecules which
in themselves are not inimical to human
life; but the process constitutes one of
piracy which robs the human body of
needed resources and loads the disposal
system of the body with materials that
it is not capable of carrying off. This
may truly be the step to the complete
control of disease—the inhibiting of a
process which makes useless protein
molecules that we term virus molecules
out of the needed resources of the human
body.
Another revolutionary device is that
termed the radar. Perhaps it should be
regarded as merely a refinement of what
we term the radio, not an extreme devel-
opment in the field of radionics. It has
great possibilities, nevertheless. Recently
there have been discovered potent in-
hibiting qualities in certain molecules
found in bread mold and mold com-
monly found in the soil. Obviously the
effect of these molecules is revolutionary
and it may reach very far. To date, we
do not know how to produce these in-
hibiting molecules in penicillin obtained
from bread mold. It is, therefore, still
nature's secret, just as whatever the
Germans may be talking about will be
their secret for a while and perhaps for a
long time. One would be justified there-
fore in concluding that the only real se-
crets that may apply to warfare are
those that produce astounding effects,
and their combinations cannot be easily
discovered although the devices in which
they may be used would prove very sim-
ple.
the bazooka
Chemists who deal with explosives
are always concerned with a certain
group of factors that are important in
this field. If such a chemist should have
before him a number of piles of mate-
rials, one, powdered coal, another black
powder, a third, smokeless powder, a
fourth TNT, a fifth picric acid, then a
cup with a pound of nitroglycerin in it,
and finally a pile with the new explosive
called "halite" in it, he would know that
each of these one pound piles of so-
called explosives or combustibles con-
tains about the same heat content and
that the effect of the combustion or the
release of the energy depends entirely
upon the time in which the energy can
be completely released, and the circum-
stances of the releasing.
How inexpensive would be the pro-
duction of war explosives if the powdered
coal would serve as well as smokeless
powder—and as TNT. But to release
10
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


oxygen and the only method that we
have found so far that can be applied
on a large scale is to secure the oxygen
from the atmosphere. As a consequence,
it takes an appreciable time to release
the energy in the pound of powdered
coal. The circumstances of the release
of the energy in the coal are, therefore,
such that it can be used under contain-
ers filled with water to produce steam
and perhaps as much as 807' of all of
the energy used in America to drive ma-
chines of industry is produced in this
fashion.
The second pile of material, black
powder, is composed of sulphur, char-
coal and saltpeter. It actually does not
have as much energy per pound as the
powdered coal. But it may be placed in
a sealed container, ignited, and all of the
energy that it contains can be released
in a very small fraction of a second.
When this combination was discovered
somewhere in China in the 12th Century
and used first as a blasting agent under
the walls of cities that were besieged,
and later in pots to project masses of in-
cendiary material over the walls, it was
a formidable secret. Anyone who might
have captured some of it could hardly
have discovered its combination. Very
few people at that time were capable
of recognizing the ingredients of such a
combination, and it must have been a
formidable secret.
The third pile of material, that is,
smokeless powder, is made from wood
Dulp or cotton fibers by the nitrating
and colloiding process, and then formed
into whatever types of grains desired.
It has approximately the same energy
in it as the black powder and performs
in approximately the same fashion.
In each of these two cases, the time
during which the energy is released
corresponds also to that of wave action
of the exploding gasoline within an in-
ternal combustion engine, labels these
agents "pushers." The rate at which
the energy is released can be controlled,
and so uniform is the effect that we may
depend very completely on their action.
The nitrated and colloided wood pulp or
cotton fibers, which we call smokeless
powder can be used in small metal car-
tridges of .22 caliber to project bullets
out of a rifle with such uniform velocity
that bullet after bullet may be placed
within a very small bull's eye at a very
Sreat distance. This is a remarkable
achievement. The results are obviously
predictable and such a material can
therefore be used in warfare on a tre-
mendous scale and the men using it may
depend upon the results. The instru-
ments with which the materials are used
wear out largely because of the effect
of excessive heat, but they are not over-
stressed, and those who use them are not
in danger from their own weapons.
When one comes to the fourth pile
of materials in the array before the
chemist, that is, TNT, we begin to enter
a new realm—a realm in which the ef-
fects are such as to make us constantly
wonder what may exist beyond present
limits. Just as we wonder what we
might see if we could magnify the re-
sults of an electronic microscope by
three—if we will discover other inhibi-
tors even more powerful than penicillin
and the sulfa drugs. We are always
tempted to believe that beyond the
limits of what we can see or what we
have, there may be other more powerful
things or processes which we hope can
be controlled and will be beneficial, but
we are not always sure of it. In the case
of the TNT, when we start the release
of energy, not by applying heat as is
the case of coal, black powder and
smokeless powder, but by producing a
shock by some other agent, we find the
energy released in a time corresponding
to a wave action with a speed of some
ten to fifteen thousand feet per second.
The speed of release is not uniform; it
cannot be controlled, and about all we
know is that we can depend upon rela-
tively uniform results, that is, highly de-
structive action, and that the material
is stable enough to permit us to handle
it rather roughly.
The next pile of material, picric acid,
resembles the TNT in certain respects.
It is much more inert however and can
be put in the armor piercing shells that
are to be fired against 14-inch armor on
battleships. Even the shock of impact
with the armor will not cause it to re-
lease its energy. It may pass entirely
through the armor and will not deton-
ate unless the release of energy is
started by a series of other explosives
which build up from one to another in
booster fashion.
The next explosive, nitro-glycerin, is

For the past several decades, a state
of civil war has existed in the Univer-
sities of this country. The opposing
forces (if you haven't already guessed)
have been the students of Literature,
Science, and the Arts, and the students
of Engineering. While the battle has
been predominantly verbal, both sides
have made attacks that would evoke
praise from even General Eisenhower.
The lit student's conception of the engi-
neer can probably be summarized thus-
ly: a dull, ill-read, quiet, conscientious
and honest fellow who carries his brain
in a small leather case swinging from
his belt. The engineer's conception of
the lit student is, if anything, less flat-
tering: jack-of-all-trades, master of
none, a good time Charley, a frivolous,
smooth-tongued, well-read individual
who doesn't know why he is going to
school except that he is having a won-
derful time. Granted that both sides are
in some respects "way off the beam,"
this is one civil war which I sincerely
hope will go on forever. In addition
to adding spice to college life, it points
out the weak points of both colleges.
It is significant that the "dull, ill-
read" engineer frankly admits that the
student of Literature, Science and the
Arts is both well-read, and smooth-
tongued. It indicates that the engineer
realizes that he is rather poorly equipped
to fully express his ideas and to "sell"
both himself and his ideas. This weak
point in the training of the graduate
engineer is not surprising. In the be-
ginning, the engineering curriculum was,
by necessity, composed almost equally
of technical subjects and liberal arts.
As competition among the various engi-
neering colleges developed these colleges
began to increase the technical content
of their curricula by deleting the liberal
arts courses. The result is that today
the graduate engineer has received a
large amount of technical training and
very little else. Naturally the engineer
should have a complete and extensive
technical background, but the adminis-
trative officials of the engineering col-
leges have apparently overlooked one of
the most important phases of his train-
ing. They have failed to realize that
the engineer, crammed full of technical
knowledge, has great difficulty selling
himself and his ideas. He is simply in-
capable of presenting his ideas to a
group of educated men in the clear, con-
cise, and logical manner to which they
are accustomed. To call a spade a spade,
his "line" is rather shabby.
From the idealistic viewpoint, the fact
that the engineer is more trained than
educated is deplorable; from the prac-
tical standpoint, this lack of education
is a barricade which must be blasted
away if he is to achieve a reasonable
degree of success in industry. When the
engineer embarks on an industrial ca-
reer, his ability to "sell" himself and hi&lt;
ideas is of the utmost importance. A
professor of the Engineering College re-
cently approved this statement without
actually realizing the full significance of
his remarks when he said, "Fellows, the
men you will work for in industry prob-
ably won't be the best technical men.
You must be able to do a good job ex-
plaining and selling your idea."
The men holding key positions in the
engineering department are usually not
the best technical men but are men who
have the ability to sell and capitalize
on ideas, often the ideas those of an-
other person. Usually the best technical
men hold less responsible, and by the
same token, less lucrative, positions in
the organization. Even in research and
development, supposedly the most tech-
nical phase of engineering, the head of
the organization probably directs the
efforts of men more technically skilled
than himself. He does, however, have
the ability to "sell" the results of his
organizational efforts to his superiors.
If the education of the engineer has
been so badly neglected, what is to be
done about it? Certainly the amount of
technical matter in the curriculum can-
not be decreased. The only alternative
is to incorporate some courses of a more
liberal nature and thus lengthen the
four year engineering course to five
vears.

sleepy joe
Fred Bryan is one of the boys in
Navy blue who have now largely re-
placed the Joe College of the "little
brown jug" era. Fred knows the good
old days himself, however, for he has
been a student here for the past three
and a half years. He will leave Ann
Arbor this January, just four hours
short of his degree. He plans, however,
to return after the war to finish.
Fred has been in the Navy since July
1 and likes it very much. He says it has
all the advantages of regular college life
plus those of being in the Navy.
This sailor comes from Melvindale,
Michigan, where he played football and
basketball for his high school. He still
likes both sports and, in addition, soft-
ball, which he played this summer.
Bryan pitched for a West Quad team
which was undefeated.

Frederick J. Bryan
Fred was kept rather busy in high
school as president of both his Junior
Pholos by John DeBoer
and Senior class and as valedictorian of
his graduating class.
On campus, his membership in Acacia,
Tau Beta Pi, and Phi Eta Sigma have
occupied a considerable portion of his
time. This year he played tackle for
the football team, and received his let-
ter. He is particularly glad to haw
played this year since Michigan tied for
the Big Ten Championship,
As far as plans for the future are con-
cerned, Fred has nothing definite in
mind, since his career has been indefi-
nitely postponed by the war. He had
thought of teaching, however, or per-
haps coaching football. Another ambi-
tion is to manufacture dance floor wax
—in which Fred insists there is a great
future.
He should know about dance floor
wax and the rate at which it is used
since he dances a lot himself and really
enjoys it. Fred likes straight dancing as
well as the wilder styles (ever hear of a
sailor who didn't have a yen for jitter-
bugging?)
His favorite piece of music is "Red-
skin Rhumba" by Charlie Barnet. Run-
ning a close second is "Two O'Clock
Jump."
Miscellaneous ... reads the Michigan
Daily (!) and, of course, the Technic
. .. likes musical comedies in movies ...
favorite pastime is sleeping but he won't
admit it!

Born in Grand Rapids, Raymond E.
Tate is a campus leader whom Michi-
gan can claim as her own. Although he
spent the greater part of his life (since
he was four) in Valley City, North Da-
kota, Michigan's attraction brought him
back nearly every summer.
Last semester Gene was elected presi-
dent of the A.I.Ch.E., student branch of
the leading profesional organization for
chemical engineers, as a reward for his
activity in the organization. He is also
a member of Tau Beta Pi.
As president of the A.I.Ch.E., Gene
has been following the aim of this
organization in fostering cooperation
among the chem engineering students
on campus and acquainting them with
related branches of engineering. He ac-
tively supports their monthly luncheons
at which students and faculty members
may get acquainted outside of class.
The son of a college professor, Gene
spends most of his time maintaining a
high scholastic average, although he is
by no means a bookworm. He enjoys
winter sports, especially skiing.

Raymond J. Tate
His chief interest outside of engineer-
ing is music. Gene played a trumpet
in the campus band of Valley City State
Teachers College, which he attended
for three years before coming to Michi-
gan.
Why he should ever want to become
a teacher we were unable to determine,
but he was good enough to be nominated
to the "Who's Who Among Students in
Americaji Universities and Colleges"
while in Valley City.
In his many wanderings, Gene has
worked in a bakery, had a job with a
surveying crew building a highway in
North Dakota, driven a tractor on a
farm and acted as Assistant Waterfront
Director of a Boy Scout camp in Minne-
sota. He also toured the western part
of the United States, including Yellow-
stone National Park, at such an early
age that he remembers very little of it.
As for the future. Gene plans to work
for the Eastman Kodak Company, if
the war does not alter his present plans.

Well, here it is time to be thinking
about next year's New Year's resolutions
—those of this year being long since
broken. Much has been said about
making and breaking New Year's reso-
lutions, but we often have wondered
about their real significance. In an at-
tempt to analyz? this age-old custom,
we have evolved the following theory,
consisting of the Three Laws of Resolu-
tions:
I. Most people are ashamed of many
of their actions and their mode of living,
in general, during any given year.
IT. These people are so ashamed of
these actions and dissipated ways of
living that they are willing at the begin-
ning of every year to impose upon them-
selves strict rules concerning these same
devilish habits, and to follow these
rules religiously.
III. At the end of several days their
respective consciences are eased consid-
erably—so much, in fact, that they are
able to continue with their dissipated
living (besides, those were the dullest
damn days they ever had the misfortune
to live through!)

—just to remind you that the Slide
Rule Ball will be coming along soon.

And then there was the janitor at the
movie studio whose salary included room
and board and all the extras he could
make.
Due to the mixed-up housing condi-
tions in A-, many amusing incidents have
occurred. For example, a sorority is
now living in a fraternity house on
Cambridge Road, namely, the A.T.O.
house. After one of the recent football
games, some A.T.O. alumni, deciding to
drop in to see the boys, went over to
the house. In the usual manner, they
strode boldly up to the front door, and
neglecting to ring the bell, walked in.

Utter chaos ensued. Imagine the dis-
comfort (?) of the poor fellows to see
a bevy of coeds lounging around the
house in something less than the cus-
tomary attire for such occasions. It
soon developed, after several girls had
left the room rather unceremoniously,
that the A.T.O.'s did not live in the
A.T.O. house but up on Geddes Avenue
instead. The old boys finally got there,
none the worse for their experience. To
this we can only comment: ''Should
happen to us!"

At a recent luncheon, there was no
clergyman present, so the host singled
out a pious, solemn-looking man in a
black coat and tie, with a religious ap-
pearance, and asked him to pronounce
a blessing.
The gentleman after being addressed
put his hand to his ear and said, "I see
you are talking to me, sir, but I am so
damned deaf that if hell froze over, I
couldn't hear the cracking of the ice."

gest female-instigated marriage boom in
history.
Because of the all-importance of this
matter, the Technic, in order to give our
readers (that means you, Joe) a more

lem, has again undertaken a poll of the

. . . engineered at Western Electric
IN a split second this enemy plane
will be blasted from the skies by
a shell from one of our anti-aircraft
guns.
How is it possible? Just think of
the mathematical problems in-
volved in hitting a plane going 300
miles an hour 20,000 feet up ... when it takes the shell
15 seconds to get up there and in that time the plane
has gone more than a mile! Besides, the shell curves in
its flight. Wind blows it. Gravity pulls on it. Even the
weather affects its velocity.
The greatest mathematician could never solve these
problems in time to hit the plane. But engineers at Bell
Telephone Laboratories and Western Electric have de-
signed and produced a Gun Director—an electrical brain
—that solves them instantly!
It plots the plane's height and course—continuously
matches the curved path of the shell to the path of the
plane so the two will meet. It aims the guns—even times
the fuse to explode the shell at the exact instant.
Putting the 3300 parts of this electrical brain into pro-
duction called for the development at Western Electric
of many special tools, machines and manufacturing
methods. Mechanical, electrical and industrial engineers
cooperated with chemical and radio engineers in this
work.
Making the electrical Gun Director is just one of many
interesting assignments in Western Electric's vast war
production job.
Till the last enemy plane is knocked
down, buy all the War Bonds you can!

gas turbines
The present high state of develop-
ment of the turbo-supercharger, used in
many modern aircraft, has turned ther-
modynamicists again to the gas turbine
as a source of power. Long forgotten
because of difficulties in handling ex-
tremely high temperature gases, it has
recently been made more practical by
metallurgical developments. It's pres-
ent use is as an "economizer" to absorb
some of the waste energy in the exhaust
gases of our aircraft engines. Since fully
a third of the power in the fuel is sent
out through the stacks, there are pos-
sibilities for tremendous improvements
in the efficiency of our power units in
this line.
It has been proposed to use th?se
partially-expanded gases to drive a large
turbine, connected either to the crank-
shaft of the internal-combustion engine
or to a separate propellor. The theory
is that, although the exhaust is at a
rather low pressure, it has high tem-
peratures which can be utilized to ad-
vantage. True, a back pressure would
be developed in the cylinders by the
turbine, but the impairment of the
reciprocating stage of our "compound"
engine would be more than made up for
by the utilization of this pressure in the
additional stage.
But this question may be sidetracked
by the development of a turbine operat-
ing independently, without preliminary
expansion of the products of combus-
tion. Although the present engines are
the most efficient devices known for ab-
sorbing the energy of very high-temper-
ature gasses, the saving of weight in
using one prime-mover (rather than two
s'ages as suggested in the previous para-
graph) would make up for any losses
involv.d in using a turbine, because
much more of the energy of the fuel
w. uld be extracted.
The component parts of such an en-
gine are shown in the drawing. The
fuel (which does not nerd to be expen-
sive high-octane) is burned in a com-
bustion chamber and conducted to the

turbine blades. These drive a compres-
sor, similar to the present superchargers,
which supplies the air for combustion.
This engine may seem to be useless
because of the necessity for the com-
pressor unit, but the power required
for compressing the air is a small frac-
tion of the total output of the engine.
Although this development is not
claimed to be revolutionary, it is defin-
itely a means of improvement of present
prime-movers. As long as we can main-
tain a uniform advancement in the qual-
ity of our power plants, we can feel that
we are accomplishing something worth
the effort involved in research and
study.
oil shale
With the coming of gas rationing, the
public has come to realize the fact that
our supply of petroleum is not as nearly
infinite as geography books would have
us believe. For years, geologists have
known that shortages were bound to
come, and they remembered an incident
that occurred in the days when Colo-
rado was being settled by the first pio-
neers. It seems that one fine upstanding
gentleman was building a home, the
fireplace of which he constructed from
rocks from the nearest cliff, of which
there were many. The first day he built
a fire in it, he discovered the amazing
fact that the fireplace burned along with
the fuel.
Although he did not realize it at the
time, scientists have since found out
that these common rocks contain a vast
supply of crude oil. To be specific, this
brittle, flakey rock yields about twenty-
five gallons per ton. This substance is
not common only to the United States,
but is also found and utilized in Scot-
land, Iran, Manchuria (before the war),
and the Tyrolian Alps. In some regions,
it has been burned directly in locomo-
tives, although it must be quite a prob-
lem to remove the ashes. In general,
though, it is merely distilled in a retort,
and the product is refined like ordinary
crude oil.
Shale, as geologists will tell you, is
merely compacted mud. Only a small
fraction of the shale in the United States
has any economic value due to oil con-
tent, and the majority of this is concen-
trated in an area of about 2,000 square
miles in Colorado, just west of Denver.
Much of this rock is easily weathered,
and it can be gathered by merely shovel-
ing it off the base of the cliff from which

HERE'S one for the book! The young
lady is soldering metal to glass to
make an important piece of electrical
war equipment, and she doesn't have to
be fussy about it either. She just solders!
The reason this can be done today is
that some time ago Corning developed
a method of firmly attaching a thin film
of metal to glass, as a base for the solder.
It was just one of many glass-metal
problems that were once called "im-
possible."
Being ready with ideas has been the
glass industry's greatest contribution to
our war effort. That, and the ability to
mass produce essential glass without
delay.
Take Corning for instance. Here re-
search found ways to mass produce es-
sential optical ware. Insulators, aerial
and naval navigation lenses, bulbs for
electronic tubes, these and countless
other war needed items are being turned
out in vast quantities.
On the civilian front, Corning right now
is supplying glass piping, and valves,
nuts and bolts that resist chemical attack.
Glass springs that apparently never
wear out. Glass acid pumps that replace
scarce metal alloys and give longer serv-
ice in the bargain!
Glass isn't taking a back seat now, or
after victory. Too many people are find-
ing out something about its unusual
qualities to ever let this happen.
They are discovering that glass is
versatile. It has astounding strength.
It can be shaped with great accuracy.
It resists corrosion and abrasive wear.
And they're finding out, too, that Corn-
ing knows glass, not only as a producer
but as a developer of glass ideas.
In engineering, too, glass is a material
with a brilliant future ... In the years
to come, keep your eye on glass! Corning

it has fallen. Shales break and crush
easily, so they can be mined in a man-
ner similar to that employed in open-pit
iron and copper mines. Some of the
richer veins, however, are tough and
rubbery and would be more difficult to
remove.
Oil shales have not been developed
very extensively in this country, and it
is unlikely that there would have been
any need for them if it had not been for
the pressure of war demands. However,
we can expect that these valuable de-
posits will soon be exploited, as science
advances to cater to the demands of our
civilization.
streamlined tugboats
We have all seen the old stern-wheeler
riverboats in the movies; they are leg-
endary "characters" in American history,
and it is interesting from a historical as
well as an engineering viewpoint to see
what kind of vessel has replaced the
showboats.
We find that a large part of the river
cargo is carried in barges, with small and
relatively powerful towboats supplying
the motive power. The shallow water of
the Mississippi and the Missouri pre-
cludes the use of large self-powered cargo
carriers, and towboats such as the

represent the latest style in rivert
design.
This twin-screw Diesel-powered ves-
sel is about one hundred fifty feet long
and draws only six and one half feet of
water. It is the most compact and pow-
erful unit yet built, and it is a proud
example of the ultimate in the applica-
tion of engineering skill as well as in
beautiful design and comfort. The
streamlining is perhaps intended more
to please the eye than to satisfy any
practical demands, and the lavish in-
terior furnishings are rather unusual for
this type of ship, but these factors
should contribute to an efficiently-work-
ing crew and at least to satisfaction for
futuristic designers.
The boat is one of the cleanest now
in use because of the Diesel engines,
which replace the more common steam
power units. It was not fuel shortages
which dictated the use of internal-com-
bustion engines on board, for a large
part of the cargo hauled consists of coal,
but rather a desire to increase the ef-
ficiency and power of these vessels.
The ship's living accommodations are
sufficient for nineteen men, with sepa-
rate quarters and lounges for officers
and men. The interior decorations re-
mind one of a penthouse rather than a
riverboat, and the only difficulty is the
fear that such luxurious surroundings
may spoil the grit-covered seamen of
our inland waterways.

Plastics Will Mean Better Homes
... and more of them!

EVEN TODAY, plastics men can vision a
bathroom with practically everything in
it made of plastics or containing plastics
in some form. Imagine such a bathroom,
costing less to manufacture, to ship, and to
install, delivered as a unit to your home!
The raw materials to make better homes
with more bathrooms and finer kitchens
come .true are in existence today ... in
VINYLITEand BAKELITE resins, and plastics
made from them.
BAKELITE resin-bonded plywood, like
that from which planes and torpedo boats
arc made, can be used to make floors,
walls, ceilings, and furniture.
The type of plastic film used in water-
proof, chemical - resistant food bags and
rifle covers can be fabricated into mildew-
proof shower curtains. VINYLJTE resins can
also be made into rot-resistant floor cov-
erings that can be walked on millions of
times without showing appreciable iccar!
Our engineers know from the record of
VlNYLITE plastic-coated life raft sails,
sleeping bags, and life preservers, that
VINYLITE plastics and compounds can be
used in the future to bring you wall cov-
erings, window curtains, and furniture
finishes that will outlast anything now
available.
Under heat and pressure, VINYLITE and
BAKELITE plastics can be molded into
numberless useful forms. Experience gained
in molding war equipment will help to bring
you such things as molded plastic furniture
which will be lighter, easier to move, easier
to keep clean!
Spun plastics made from vinyl resins
arc resistant to rot. Right now, such plas-
tics are used for making jungle hammock
ropes and vital chemical filters. They also
can be fashioned into draperies, upholstery,
stockings, and other articles of clothing
...sun-proof, water-proof, and moth-proof!
VISYLITE and BAKELITE resins and plas-
tics, and many new techniques for using
them, are peacetime research achievements

!his with a simple telegraph code. Sup-
nose you arrange a code in which "one''
means white, "two" signifies grey, and
"three," black. By dividing the scene
into imaginary squares, 100 each way,
numbering them in sequence from one
to 10,000, and sending a friend 10,000
digits, each representing the shade in
one square, you would enable him to re-
produce the picture, on a sheet of paper
mled into 100 squares each way.
Obviously, this would be a tedious
process. If, however, instead of sending
numbers by telegraph code, you trans-
mitted one electric impulse for each
square in sequence, the strength of each
impulse corresponding to the degree of
light in the square it represents, you
might send a description of the picture
in 10,000 seconds, if you transmitted
one impulse per second.
At the receiving end, a printing de-
vice would be necessary to record each
impulse in the same order and location,
and with an ink intensity corresponding
to the current strength of each impulse.
The chief problem is one of syncroni-
zation between transmitter and receiver.
This is the facsimile system, used on
wire and radio, except that several im-
pulses are sent each second, so that
only ten minutes or so are required to
transmit a picture, instead of two and
one-half hours.
But here is the rub: television must
{continued from pane 0)
transmit moving scenes, sending as
many as thirty scenes per second, so
lhat, as in the movies, the eye will be
deceived into believing it sees a continu-
ous scene rather than a succession of
stills. To send thirty pictures a sec-
ond, information about each little part
of the picture is required 18,000 times
faster than in the facsimile system.
Here was have the primary cause of
most of the television engineering prob-
lems—the time element, or the necessity
for transmitting an enormous amount of
information very accurately and very
quickly. Electronic scanning with the
aid of the "iconoscope" has helped solve
this problem.
The iconoscope converts light waves
into electricity just as the microphone
converts sound waves into electricity.
The device contains a plate upon which
the scene being televised is focused.
The surface of this plate is covered with
thousands of photo-electric cells, micro-
scopic in size, each separate from the
others and each generating an electric
charge, the strength of which is propor-
tional to the light which strikes it. To
use these charges, they must be collected
from each cell. This might be done by
brushing a tiny wire across the plate,
contacting the whole area bit by bit.
But the idea is impractical because of
the speed with which the process must
be performed. So a beam of electrons

is utilized instead. This tiny "search-
light" travels over the plate, line by
line, collecting the electric charge from
each cell in turn.
The present standard calls for 441 of
these lines on the plate from top to
bottom, whereas the first systems had
only twenty-four. The greater the num-
ber of these lines, there are of course,
the more detail can there be put into
the picture. But the more lines there
are to cover, the more work the little
beam must do and the more informa-
tion there is to transmit. It has been
found that 441 lines is the best compro-
mise that can be found between picture
quality and transmission difficulty. This
number has been made standard for this
country.
The beam explores the whole plate
thirty times per second, and there are
about 250,000 spots to be thus visited.
It "reads" from left to right at about
two miles per second, and retracts from
right to left at twenty miles per second.
As a comparison, if your eye could move
that fast, you could read a 1,000 page
book in about five seconds.

LEARN TO KNOW YOUR BEARINGS NOW
JLOU may not get into this war, but there will be another tough
struggle awaiting you when Victory has been won and the job of recon-
struction begins. You probably will graduate right into the midst of the
most severe competitive situation our country ever has known.
Then, as a full-fledged engineer, you will have the responsibility of keep-
ing your company's products ahead of those of competitors by giving them
greater speed, precision and endurance; lower operating and maintenance costs.
That's where your specialized knowledge of Timken Bearing design and
application will pay dividends; for you will be in position to meet any and
every bearing condition with complete protection against friction; radial,
thrust and combined loads; and misalignment of
moving parts.

one of the most powerful of all, but at
the same time is one of the most difficult
to handle. It releases its energy in a
time period corresponding to a speed
of wave action from fifteen to twenty
thousand feet per second. Again it can-
not .be controlled, but we can predict
its highly destructive effects. It is so
sensitive that it cannot be used as a mili-
tary explosive, as are TNT and picric
acid, and those who handle it must be
more than careful, because a relatively
slight shock will start the release of en-
ergy.
This whole group from TNT through
nitro-glycerin, and more that belong in
the group, have what we call a shatter-
ing effect. The first group were "push-
ers," the second "shatterers." And
we have always wondered what would
happen if we could discover an explosive
that might release its energy in half of
the time of nitroglycerin or perhaps a
third of the time. Would it be a "shat-
terer," or what would it do? We have
now discovered in one new explosive
termed "halite" some of the things it
will do.
Sometime before the invasion of the
low countries a French chemist in com-
bining various high explosives discov-
ered one that had an extraordinary ef-
fect. He passed it on to the French
Ministry of Armament in the hope of
having it recognized for its unique
qualities; they had still not done any-
thing with it when the Germans invaded
France, and he barely got his secret,
which really was, and is, a secret, out of
Paris and out of France in time. It was
presented to the American General Staff
and put under development at once. It

"No one seems to have lived to tell the tale"
was found that it would not safely
stand the shock of starting up the bore
of a gun, as would TNT or picric acid.
It might release its energy in the gun.
This premature explosion would, of
course, destroy the cannon.
Halite was tried in rifle grenades first
and its effects were truly extraordinary.
It was appreciated that the one target
that we wished to destroy was the tank,
and that the heaviest and largest of
tanks would probably not have more
than three inches of armor at their
strongest point, and no tank could carry
much of this three-inch armor because
it would make the tank too heavy to
travel over soft ground or at any high
speed. The effect of a relatively small
mass of this new explosive on the three-
inch armor was something that no one
had seen before. When the rifle grenade
would strike the armor, those in the
bomb proof shelter watching the effect
through heavily protected openings
would see a blinding glare as a small
sun. Examination of the armor later
indicated that it was not shattered as
by the usual high explosive. In fact, an
equivalent weight of TNT would have
had relatively little effect. But there
was a hole straight through the three
inches of armor, a hole perhaps 1 and
V-&gt;" in diameter and it was as though it
had been roughly burned through with
an acetylene torch. The steel removed
had been rendered incandescent in an
inconceivably short period of time and
blown through the plate. It was blown
through in conical pellets of melted
steel, and its effect on the personnel
within a tank could only be imagined.
No one seems to have lived to tell the
tale.
So we had passed into a third realm
of effects of the release of energy. The
development of the rifle grenade and fa-
cilities for the production of this new
and extraordinarily powerful explosive
were rushed to completion, in order
that it might be given a tryout on the
fighting fronts. It was appreciated thai
it was going to be used in relatively
close combat service. The material
could not be shot out of a cannon, could
not be used in anti-tank cannon or field
cannon, and it would probably have to
be used in relatively small quantities
except in bombs dropped from planes.
The problem of how to stop the tank
has been very difficult to solve. It is a
moving target against which the ordi-
nary field artillery is not very adequate.

that becomes a precious jewel...


1. High over Berlin on the instrument
board of a bomber, these synthetic sap-
phires become the most precious jewels in
the world. They're man-made jewels for
instrument bearings. Without them, no
bomber could drop its load with accuracy,
no warship could navigate. Before Pearl
Harbor most of these synthetic jewels
came from abroad. But today industry is
mass producing its own with the help of
diamond blades and polishing compounds
such as made by Carborundum.
2. Man-made sapphires are created by
fusing aluminum oxide. To turn the
rough boule into a bearing requires
more than 100 precision operations,
including cutting, grinding and pol-
ishing. No tolerance over 0.0003 in.
is permissible. One of the best
abrasives for producing a sapphire
bearing is the diamond. So diamond
grinding compounds by Carborundum
are widely utilized.


3. War has given enormous impetus to the
art of grinding. In industry, you may
find operations which might be done
better with abrasives. Carborundum en-
gineers will be glad to consult with you
on any such problem. The Carborundum

beam from the cells are small, but they
can be amplified. These currents con-
trol the transmitter antenna current.
At the receiving end, the entire process
is reversed with the aid of a "kine-
scope."
This instrument has a plate and beam
of electrons playing on it, just as does
the iconoscope. In the former, however,
the plate comprises a screen. It is coated
with a layer of material which flour-
esces, or gives off light, when electrons
strike it. When the electron beam in
the kinescope strikes the screen in one
spot, this spot glows, its brightness vary-
ing with the strength of the beam. The
spot of light is used to reproduce each
point on the picture, one at a time. The
beam "paints" the lights and shadows
of the picture as a series of spots, but to
our slowly reacting eyes, the spots are
not individually visible, and the screen
appears to be illuminated uniformly.
The flying beam of the kinescope must
be in perfect step with that of the icono-
scope, miles distant, or there will not be
a recognizable picture. The problems
of synchronization have been solved,
but it is too involved for discussion
here.
37 and 40 mm. guns, have not had all
of the power that we would desire at
long ranges. And one does not generally
expect to use such artillery at ranges of
200 to 400 yards, which is actually close
rifle range. The long popular idea of
the rocket was then dragged out of re-
tirement and put to work again. The
result is the "Bazooka."
The Bazooka should more properly be
titled a two-man rocket gun. It is a thin
walled tube 2.36 inches in diameter and
is 54 inches long. It has two hard grips
and a shoulder rest. It has a sighting
rectangle on the front with wires for
100, 200, 300, and 400 yards. There is
a ring on the rear to prevent damage
to the tube. The tube is open at both
ends. It is fired electrically from a bat-
tery in one of the hand grips, and it
rests on the shoulder of the one man
while his companion charges the tube
with the rocket projectiles.
The two-man battery can carry 16
rockets in canvas bags suspended on
their chests and backs. The second man
in the team introduces the rocket in the
rear and places it for proper electrical
contact. A latch holds it in place so
Scenes of any size can be televised by
the transmitter, but at the receiving
end, the size of the picture is deter-
mined definitely by the size and bril-
liancy of the kinescope screen. At pres-
ent there are two standard sizes, five by
seven inches, and seven by ten inches.
In the fall of 1941, NBC showed tele-
vision on a seven by ten foot screen, but
there is a size limit for the screens be-
yond which it is impractical to go. It
has been found that the most desirable
size of picture for television or movies
is one where the height of the picture
represents one-fourth on the distance
between screen and observer. In the
home, the desirable receiving distance
may be eight or ten feet, so the picture
height should be about two feet.
Partly because so much information
must be transmitted in so small a period
of time, tremendously high frequencies
are necessary in television. The ordi-
nary electric light circuit has a fre-
quency of sixty cycles per second, but
sound broadcast stations use frequencies
up to 1,500,000 cycles per second, while
television uses up to 50,000,000. Radio
laboratories are now experimenting with
frequencies of more than a billion
cycles!
Eighty-seven television programs were

that it will not slide out at high eleva-
tions. The charge of smokeless powder
which propels it is contained in the
rocket itself, which is about 18 inches
long and 2.36 inches in diameter. It
weighs between three and four pounds
and is a very crude looking device. It
takes about two hundredths of a sec-
ond for the rocket projectile to travel up
the tube, and all of the propellant has
been consumed before it leaves the muz-
zle, so that no fire is thrown into the
face of the gunner. The rocket has a
velocity of about 450 feet per second
when it leaves the muzzle. This is about
the same as the .45 caliber automatic
pistol bullet. Its maximum range is
about 400 yards, and with training, the
gunner can attain fair accuracy at that
range. But since this is designed as a
close combat weapon, it is more apt to
be used at 200 yards than 400. At 200
yards, the gunner will seldom miss a
tank. When the projectile strikes the
side of the tank, it produces the effect
that we have already noted. That is, a
hole is blown through the steel armor
of the tank, and all of the material in a
relatively incandescent state is blown
telecast by NBC in 1941, the last year
when any significant work was done on
the subject, but only about 100 families
were able to enjoy these broadcasts,
radiating from the antenna atop the
Empire State Building, because there
are only that many receivers in the New
York area, most of them in the homes
of NBC and RCA engineers.
Most people assume television pro-
grams will be accompanied by sound,
but programs without it have been
found desirable in some instances. In
fact, television may take up pantomine
acting where Hollywood left it many
years ago.
At present, television needs what
radio needed in the days of crystal sets,
hams, and tinkerers. RCA recently
made available to amateurs certain spe-
cialized parts, such as the kinescope,
and soon, complete television kits, con-
taining all parts necessary for building
receivers, may be placed on the market.
Once the art emerges from the labora-
tory, the nation's hams and tinkerers
will play an important part in its de-
velopment.
And what of the hams who perform
this labor of love? They will probably

distributors of tomorrow.

fuel and kill the ocupants of the tank.
It is something truly revolutionary in
warfare, and as yet is a real secret.
We have all heard mention of what is
termed atomic energy. Perhaps noDe
knows precisely what is meant by that,
because most of us thought that all of
the energy available in atoms of mate-
rials which compose the earth was ex-
pended in making the combinations that
we now know. It would seem, therefore,
necessary to introduce an equivalent
amount of energy into any mass oi
material to get any energy out. But if
there is any method of detonating an
atom, which can then in turn serve
as a detonator for surrounding atoms,
it could conceivably be the basis of the
threat being broadcast from Germany-
today, that will destroy their neighbor.
Britain, or at one stroke exact ven-
geance for the destruction that they
have suffered in Germany. They even
talk grandiosely of destroying half the
globe. This is a Buck Rogers sort of
idea, too fantastic and preposterous. If
not, it is perhaps the most terrible in-
vention that anyone could discover.

There are two operational factors that have more
to do with the life and efficiency of reamers
than may be generally known. One is the matter
of feeds and speeds; the other, the condition of
the hole.
As to the former—with due regard to machine
set-up, required finish, and part design—in
general, reamer speeds should be from 60 to 70%
of drilling speeds, and feeds should be two to

of cutting. This is also true with bell mouthed
holes, caused by faulty drilling, or drilling without

For efficient reaming in ferrous metals 1/64 inch
of stock should be left on holes up to 1/2 inch
diameter, and 1/32 inch left in holes of greater
diameter. A smaller amount of stock may be left
in softer metals. The correct amount in individual
cases can be determined by experiment.

1) This little iron bowl helped
shape the pattern of industry to-
day; it holds the key to much of
the progress that is to come. For
in it Dr. E. G. Acheson created the
first man-made abrasive, silicon
carbide, to which he gave the
trade name "Carborundum"—52 years
ago. From that discovery in turn
came the super refractories which
opened the way for the economical
development of modern metallurgi-
cal processes. j
~'

2) For instance, one of these
super refractories is vitally
important to the process by
which our huge naval and coast
defense guns are annealed
under closely controlled
conditions.

3) To withstand other speci-
fic service needs covering a
wide range of conditions over
65 varieties of Carborundum
Brand Specialized Refracto-
ries are available. Used in
furnaces, kilns, retorts and
refining equipment, they are
helping to speed output of
thousands of war essentials.

fractories will help produce new
and better materials. When you

A new glass sink has been developed
primarily for the purpose of saving
vital war materials, but it promises to
hold its own after the war. The glass is
made strong by a heat tempering process
similar to that used on metal. The
sink is particularly attractive because
of the ease of cleaning it.

Few people have a conception of the
amount of dynamite used each year. In
order to produce the surface material
of each mile of an 18 foot highway, a
ton of dynamite is consumed. A pound
of T.N.T. is used to mine the metal for
a single light car, and millions of pounds
are used to keep our petroleum flowing.

Aircraft and other war plants are now
taking advantage of the fact that white
cement floors will reflect light more
readily than gray. It has been found
that light on the underside of the work
is increased 61 per cent and on the ver-
tical surfaces 20 per cent.
reminder
On the more solemn side, shortages
of such canned goods in India and the
Far East resulted in more deaths than
were suffered by the Allies and the Axis
on all fronts last year. The Committee
of Indian Congressmen in London stated
that at least 15,000,000 Bengalese are
foodless. This is not a plea for the
United War Chest, but a reminder that
we are sharing but a small part of the
hardships involved in winning a war.

CUSHIONING Tlaqships. FOR EASY LANDINGS
in to an easy landing as a
climax to a safe, comfortable flight
is the result of attention to many details.
That "cushioned landing," for example,
is prepared before the flight by a serv-
iceman as pictured above. He is giving
the oleo struts their exact amount of "air
cushion" — and an Airco gas regulator
does the job accurately. The same
method is used for controlling the air
pressure to bal-
ance the hy-
draulic system
which operates

landing flap brakes and retractable
landing gear—and Airco nitrogen is the
gas widely used for this purpose.
Numerous are the aviation uses of
Air Reduction gases and apparatus. For
instance, an Airco regulator contributes
to comfortable flight at high altitudes
. . . arc welded jigs make possible mass
production of airplanes ... gas welding
and cutting torches, as well as gas cut-
ting machines play vital roles in the pro-
duction of struts, engine mounts, and
many other important aircraft parts.
With these products and through its
role as a leading producer of atmos-
pheric and chemically derived gases.
Air Reduction is helping to facilitate es-
sential operations in almost every major

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


The Electron Microscope
The chemical engineer draws upon
the fields of physics, chemistry, mathe-
matics, and other engineering branches
for much of his fundamental informa-
tion and for many of the techniques.
These sciences are rapidly exploring new
realms and developing new tools, and
the alert chemical engineer must scruti-
nize the new advances of these associ-
ated groups as well as those of his own
profession to provide solutions to his
problems.
The electron microscope has been de-
veloped as a commercial instrument dur-
ing the past two or three years. It per-
mits magnifications about 100 times
greater than that of the light microscope.
Just as a magnification of SOO diameters
is common for light photomicrographs,
magnifications of 20,000 to 50,000 di-
ameters are common for the electron mi-
croscope. Both visual and photographic
observations may be made, but the elec-
tron miscroscope uses electrons rather
than light waves and magnetic fields
rather than glass lenses. Figure 1 is a
diagrammatic sketch of the elements of
the instrument.
The electrons are emitted from a hot
filament and accelerated by magnetic
fields. The objective is placed in the
electron path, and those which strike it
are absorbed and reflected by the ob-
ject. The undisturbed electrons are ex-
panded by the "lenses" and finally im-

pinge on a radiodescent screen with
darkness representing abscence of elec-
trons.
However, the space containing the
object and through which the electrons
flow must be at a pressure below 10-'
millimeters of mercury. This low pres-
sure and the small objects under consid-
eration make special techniques neces-
sary. Only solid or non-volatile sub-
stances may be observed. The speci-
ments are placed on a thin collodion
film which is retained on a Vx" diameter
200 mesh stainless steel screen. Since
the electrons must pass through the
specimen, special techniques have been
developed to examine thin replicas of
metallurgical surfaces from deposited
metals or silica.
An RCA electron microscope, shown
in figure 3, was installed in the Randall
Physics Laboratories at the University
of Michigan in the spring of 1941 by a
grant from the Horace H. Rackham
School of Graduate Studies. Professor
O. S. Duffendack is director of the proj-
ect. The electron microscope has been
particularly useful in the science of bac-
teriology for studying small bodies such
as the virus. The question arose as to
problems for which it would be useful
in the engineering field.
a new tool to
chemical engineering problems is not al-
ways easy or obvious. A consciousness
of the new tool will often prompt possi-
ble applications in some later problems.
Investigators using the light microscope
might have been examining some indus-
trial solid of such fineness that only
spherical shapes could be observed. The
electron misroscope should give shape to
such particles. Substances believed to
be in a colloidal state, or large molecules
such as high polymers, would provide
interesting objectives if suitable speci-
mens could be prepared.
The writer has worked on three lim-
ited projects in which the electron mi-
croscope was of value. The first obser-
vations were made on crude oils in a
search for asphaltic particles. Bitumen,
resembling powdered coke, was found
in oil and gas separators on some deep
oil wells. The problem was to find the
cause for the precipitation of this as-
phalt. A specimen was prepared by di-
luting crude oil with benzene and plac-
V
. i*.

tron micrographs of zinc oxide shows

film. Then the film of crude oil was
washed with petroleum ether to remove
excess oil. Electron miscroscope exami-
nation of the specimen showed asphal-
tic particles to be present in true solu
tion in crude oils, but they were highly
unstable, and could be precipitated by
solvents and by electrical effects. The
precipitation at the oil well is believed
due to electrical effects accompanying
the flow of oil through the sand and up
the pipe to the Earth's surface.
The second problem was a simple
comparison of light and electron micro-
graphs of industrial solids. Particles
less than about one micron (.001mm.)
in diameter appear in the light micro-
scope as spherical shapes or become in-
distinct. Thus, finely divided solids
have had to be classified by methods
other than that of direct observation,
such as sedimentation rates, etc.
Figure 2 top, is a light micrograph of
zinc oxide, and figure 2 below, is an
electron micrograph, showing the needle-
like structure completely unobserved in
the light micrograph. The line repre-
sents one micron. Zinc oxide is used as
a paint pigment and as a catalyst in
which the surface characteristics are im-
portant.
It is interesting to note that a recent
article compared catalytic activity with
surface assuming that the zinc oxide
consisted of uniform particles [J.A.C.S.
Vol. 65, p. 431 (1943]. Elecron micro-
scope studies would have shown more
clearly the physical structure and sur-
face of the finely divided solid.
A third project was the study of crys-
tals formed as a result of the hydration
of Portland cement compounds. Port-
land cement is composed of tricalcium
silicate (3Ca0 . Si02), dicalcium silicate
(2Ca0 . SiO.,), tricalcium aluminate
(3Ca0 . A1,03), tetra-calcium alumino
ferrite (4CaO . A1,03 . FeA), and
gypsum. These compounds react with
water to form crystaline or amorphous
hydration products which bind the ag-
gregates of concrete together.
Previous light micrographs on cement
hydrates were reported with contradic-
tory statements appearing in the litera-
ture.
A series of photographs on pure com-
pounds suspended in water were made

of Michigan.
by placing a drop of what appeared to
be a supernatant liquid on the collodion
film. The results confined previous re-
action products established by other in-
vestigations and showed the crystaline
form of the several products.
Electron micrographs of a hydrated
Portland cement have shown the charac-
teristic shapes of its constituents; spheri-
cal calcium hydroxide, splines of cal-
cium sulpho aluminate, and rectangular
slabs of dicalcium silicate and/or tri-
calcium aluminate. Figure 4. is a par-
ticle of Portland cement bristling with
rectangular slabs of the dicalcium sili-
cate hydrate and the needle-like struc-
ture found in calcium hydroxide. It
should be noted that the particle is not
supported by film. The study gives new
ideas on the hydration process and
shows that the splines and fibrous struc-
ture may contribute to the strength oi
the cement.

Fig. 4. A particle of portland cement
after hydration for one week. The crys-
talline structure is clearly seen.
This experience with the microscope
opens new realms of study in crystal
growth. The formation of neuclii in the
instrument would tell untold secrets of
seed crystal action. First, however,
some container must be developed which
will hold liquid at low pressure and per-
mit electrons to pass through the walls.
Enlargement of the usefulness of the
electron microscope will come with the
development of new techniques for sam-
ple preparation, and it will help greatly
to solve the problems faced by the
chemical engineer.

vivid intensity of nature as she mixes
upon her palette the fiery gold of the

TECHKIC
PRESENT

ovie
Have you seen that little man who
buzzes across campus at sixty miles per?
Well, if you have, it was probably Ovie
even if you haven't, it was
probably Ovie! ! This cute, dark little
man, former editor of the Tcchnic, and
member of the Vulcans, is really quite
the sight in his conventional tan polo
coat, brown hat (tipped over one eye to
give him that "certain" look), and, of
course, brown shoes. Do you know who
we mean? You don't? Well, you have
no idea what you're mising, if you don't
know Robert Overcashier, who is affec-
tionately known to all his friends as
"Ovie." We shall introduce him to you
right now.

Robert H. Overcashier
Ovie came to Michigan from Fork
Union Military Academy, where he
spent a few very enjoyable month after
graduation from Butler High School,
Pennsylvania. At Fork Union, his best
memory is of walking penalty tours for
three days after a little trip he and some
fellow students took to Washington,
U. C. They returned in a cab from
Washington (120 miles), had a won-
derful time, and felt that it was worth
it.
Photos by John DeBoer
At Michigan, he has made a fairly
good record in spite of things like his
addiction to bow ties of uncouth colors
and to haunt his Mother, saying
nothing of what they do to his friends.
Anyway, he thinks he will be graduated
this month to receive his degree in
Chemical Engineering. We can see him
now, with a long, white beard, bending
over a lab table, pouring weird concoc-
tions from one test tube to another say-
ing, "I've got it!! I've got it!! Now the
world will appreciate my 90 years of
laborious research when they learn that
I have discovered a way to make bour-
bon cheaply from petroleum." Yes,
Ovie, has already begun to dabble in
petroleum research and hopes to con-
tinue it. The first hundred years are the
hardest, Ovie!
However, Ovie does have his serious
side at times, he tells us (though we
haven't been able to find it) especially
when it comes to talking about his alma
mater. He thinks that Michigan is a
very good school, but objects to its con-
servatism which results in a rather
poorly-integrated social life. He feels
that Michigan, because of its good repu-
tation, has leaned o%'er backward a lit-
tle in keeping up that good name. You
know the old saying, "If it's fun, you
can't do it."
We all have our own opinions of Ovie,
maybe you would like to form one.
Here's a lead what would you
think of a person whose pet ambition is,
or was, to change the Technic into a Po-
lice Gazette? We knew you'd say that!

"Now, be sure to tell them that I was
born and bred in Minnesota and that I
have a twenty-two month old son."
Thus began a very informal, but in-
formative interview with Mr. William
W. Hagerty, an instructor of Engineer-
ing Mechanics.
Hagerty is one of those people with a
refreshing sense of humor and a love of
sports and work. Although he worked
from 12 a.m. until 8 a.m. for a pipe line
company while attending school, he
found time to do his work as well as
become proficient in golf and bowling.
By the way, Hagerty just recently went
to the quarter finals in the Ann Arbor
city golf tournament.

William W. Hagerty
Between the years of graduation and
the present, Hagerty has worked fur
many companies and has attended and
taught in three schools. During this
time he says he has found that, on a
whole, students and grads of the Uni-
versity of Michigan are more intellect-
ual than those of any of the other big
ten schools. Right now Hagerty is a
hard working applicant for his S.C.D.
To get back to the subject of sports.
I have no doubt that many of you at one
time or another have heard of Mr. Hag-
erty's hunting stories. This seems like
an appropriate time to relate one.
"It was in the winter of 1936. On
the way back from northern Minnesota
where I had been deer hunting, I
stopped at a roadside inn for a cup of
'coffee'. While I was drinking my 'cof-
fee,' I noticed two fellows who were
quite drunk. I asked the bartender,
whom I knew from previous years, what
was the matter with them. He told me
to take a look in the station wagon out
side. Well, you'll never believe me when
I tell you. Across one of the seats were
three dead deer and the bodies of three
dead men frozen stiff. You can just im-
agine my amazement.
"After a few surprised seconds I went
back in, and the bartender told me what
the three drunk men had told him. It
seems that five friends from Ohio had

northern Minnesota for the ten day
hunting season. On the first day, after
having gotten things settled in their
cabin, they started out to hunt, two of
the men stalking and three of them
driving. Now none of them had done
much hunting before, so, as soon as
they saw a movement in the bushes, the
three men who were driving filled the
area with lead. Upon going to claim
their deer, they found one of their party
instead.
"Being a practical group, and taking
into account that their hunting licenses
had cost twenty-fh'e dollars and that
the cabin had cost them a lot, they de-
cided to finish their hunting first before
reporting the accident. So they put the
body in the woodshed to freeze. How-
ever, their attempt the next day at deer
hunting was even less successful, for two
more corpses were added to the rapidly
growing pile.
"And now, eight days later, having
caught their quota, they were on the
way back to Ohio. However, by the
time they had gotten this far, their cargo
of rotting humanity had become too
much for them, and they were now
awaiting the arrival of the state police."
the dreamer
If you know Les Burnett, you prob-
ably know what we mean we say that
he'll try to make you think he's lazy.
He'll tell you that his ambition in life
is to sail to the South Sea islands as
soon as he can. He might have been
there by now, had it not been for the

Leslie R. Burnett
war. He was back in high school when a
group of his friends thought of the idea
of sailing to the South Pacific rather
than the usual high school students's
ambition of traveling to the Pacific
Coast. It was no "pipe-dream" as
many such plans are, for they actually
purchased the boat in which they plan-
ned to make the trip. However, their
plans fell thru with the story, for as Les
said, "I'm the only civilian left."
As president of the Engineering Coun-
cil, president of his fraternity, Zeta Psi
and a member of the men's judiciary
council, Les is much busier than he
would have you believe. However,
he does find time to break up the week-
ly grind by those long to be remem-
bered Saturday nights at the "Bell,"
and he even finds time to have a date
occasionally, much to the dismay of his
fellow engineers.
Although having been on the campus
for only two years, Les expects to grad-
uate in February providing "God and
the profs willing." In March he hopes
to be working on the West Coast enjoy-
ing the balmy weather, for it's about as
close as he can get to those South Sea
islands during the war.

By
ROBERT D. ROOSMA, "46E
The work of Frank Lloyd Wright, the country's outstanding exponent of
modern architecture, leads the way towards a characteristic American style.
Frank Lloyd Wright, with his un-
bending will and determination to pro-
duce originality of style, has given to
the world an architecture of democracy.
He has proven to the world that good
architecture can grow out of personal
character and original ideas without en-
dorsement of long established standards.
When Frank Lloyd Wright became a
student of Louis H. Sullivan, he began
a career that gave America an art that
she could proudly trade-mark, and call
her own. The American people would
not recognize Sullivan's great ability
until it was accepted in Europe. In
Wright, America has a second chance
to claim an even greater student of
originality and unique style. If she ac-
cepts Wright, she will have acquired a
little of the culture that allows nations
to endure, and be remembered.
Free people should express their free-
dom and love of liberty in their work.
Frank Lloyd Wright believed deeply in
this theme, and he expresses it in almost
all of his writings about architecture.
In his lectures at Princeton, he attempts
to show the young architectural students
how ridiculous it is for us to copy
European architecture.
"Now, let us remember, in forming
this new Arts and Crafts Society at
Hull house, that every people has done
its work and therefore evolved Art as
an expression of its own life, using th?
best tools; and that means the most
economical and effective tools or con-
trivances it knew, the tools most suc-
cessful in saving valuable human effort.
The chattel slave was the essential tool
of Greek civilization and therefore of
its art. We have discarded this tool and
would refuse the return of the art of the
Greeks, were slavery the terms of its
restoration; and slavery, in some form,
would be the terms.1"
Until the time of Sullivan and
Wright, architecture was not considered
good unless it was an almost exact copy
of some long established form. Wright,
however, presents a style radical and
modern. He uses individuality as his
book of rules, and nature is his only re-
striction. Because of this, he believes
in bringing out the Nature of the Mate-
rials and building a color scheme with
the natural, colors of the materials
blending with the surroundings.
Wright, like Sullivan, is trying to give
America an architecture of its own, but
from the first, he has had to battle one
time honored opponent, Tradition. "Be-
hind personality, Tradition should stand
—behind Tradition stands the race. We
have put Tradition before personality—
and made Tradition as a fatal hurdle for
the race." - With his own ideals to
guide him, Frank Lloyd Wright set out
to dethrone Tradition.
Wright's first striking form of modern

home.
architecture came in his designs of
homes. In the architecture and land-
scape of a home, he believed that na-
ture should rule supreme and be the
only guide to correct form. Man's chief
Nothing can be found that is more
beautiful than a natural setting, for it
is from nature that man receives his in-
spiration for beauty. Therefore, the
most perfect architectural structure,
from a standpoint of beauty, would
blend so closely with nature that she
would adopt it for her own. These ideals
were the basis for the motif of Wright's
houses.
"A building should appear to grow
easily from its site and be shaped to
harmonize with its surroundings, if Na-
ture is manifest there; and if not, try
to make it as quiet, substantial, and or-
ganic as she would have were the op-
portunity hers."3 Nowhere does man
realize the greatness for his freedom
as he does when he finds himself able to
enjoy nature. This love of freedom and
nature is deep within the heart of every
American, for he has had to carve his
civilization out of her bosom and build
his home against her beauty.
The Taliesin and Falling Water are
two classic examples of what Wright
means by having a building "grow easily
from its site." Falling Water is a home
built over a waterfall. It is set deep in
the Allegheny Mountains at Bear Run.
Pennsylvania. The house itself is
blended so perfectly in color and form
that it seems truly a part of its natural
surroundings. It is constructed of wood
and rocks that, in their natural colors,
match perfectly the design of the land-
scape. The lines are simple yet effec-
tive. The decorations are for the most
part designed by the architect himself,
for Wright believes the most simple
lines give the truest beauty to any struc-
ture. Ornamentation to excess is used to
cover up faulty architecture and does
nothing to add to the permanent beauty
of the house.
The Taliesin is Frank Lloyd Wright's
favorite home. It is built upon a sloping
hill which was the scene of many of the
happy days of his childhood. It was de-

had it rebuilt, adding more and more to
its beauty. It is, perhaps, because in
this house he can realize his fondest
dreams of interior as well as exterior
decoration, that he loves Taliesin so
much.
In his autobiography, Wright set
down the rules he follows in completing
and planning a home—"We eliminate
the decorator. He was 'applique and
all efflorescence', if not all 'period'. Hu-
man use and comfort should not be
taxed to pay dividends on any 'design-
er's' idiosyncrasy. Human use and com-
fort should have intimate possession of
every interior—should be felt in every
exterior. Decoration is intended to
make use more charming and comfort
more appropriate, or a privilege has been
abused."
Nothing is more disagreeable to
Wright than to see one of his modern
houses filled with antique furnishings.
He tries to incorporate modern ideas
about interior decoration by designing
some of the furnishings as part of the
architecture. His rooms are always de-
signed to leave plenty of space for
movement. The high ceilings are cut
down to where they fit man and not a
giant of some other world. He does not
believe in fireplaces that cannot be used
or attics that are nothing more than
store rooms. Basements are not neces-
sary, as heating is just as practical with-
out them. His ideas are radical but
truly American, especially in being prac-
tical in cost.
"To be Organic Architecture, it must
come to terms with living human spirit.
It must come to terms with the whole
flow of human life—be a part of it and
help direct it. There must be the in-
tegration of a whole people with their
own soil or ground. There must be an
end of the use of labor, money, ground
and buildings, as speculative commodi-
ties. There must be a popular realiza-
tion of organic structure as the basis
of all culture in the development of the
whole people." 4
In describing the standards by which
Wright guides the beauty and function
of his architecture, I mentioned The
Xature of the Materials. It is largely
through his study and use of the modern
building materials that Wright is able to
produce his style. There is no longer a
need for peaked roofs and flying but-
tresses. The days of the old fortress
castle and the pillars of the Greek tem-
ples are gone. In a new age, the life
should be accentuated by new designs.
Surely, if beauty in architecture could
be captured in the Medieval ages with
all the limitations of building materials,
we, with all our advancements in that
field, should reach even greater heights.
Wright is continually trying to get the
American people to accept and believe
in the new advancements made in the
field of building materials. He fought
incessantly for windows that open out,
instead of the acepted form of opening
up and down. He realizes that it is
carried out to the letter with little
thought as to whether it was the best
possible structure for the job.
When Wright first entered the field
of industrial design, he found that the
engineers were very much opposed to a
new style of architecture. He found that
the engineers did not have sufficient
formulas worked out to measure the
stresses that would occur in a new de-
sign. He had to hire hundreds of trained
men to calculate the problems caused

these new improvements that gives a
house style and comfort. The individual
characteristics of the modern man can
only be expressed by modern architec-
ture.
"There should be as many kinds
(styles) of houses as there are kinds
(styles) of people, and as many differ-
entiations as there are different individ-
uals. A man who has individuality (and
what man lacks it?) has a right to its
expression in his own environment." s
As early as 1894, Wright designed
the Frances Apartments in Chicago.
From that time on, he devoted a great
deal of his time to designing large build-
ings and projects. In industry, he found
that the modern leaders would not ac-
cept his architecture at first. The indus-
trial designers gave little thought to
function in the buildings being built.
The factories were more like prisons
than places in which men were to work.
The Post and Beam theory had been
by his new Cantilever Construction.
When Wright was given the job of de-
signing the "Imperial Hotel," in Tokyo,
he used Cantilever Construction as the
basis for the design of the building. He
had one tremendous problem in planning
this building, and that was earthquakes.
Japan's buildings had all been of light
construction, which, during an earth-
quake, was completely destroyed. No
building had ever been buiit that could
withstand the earth's tremors, so build-
ings that could be built easily and quick-
ly were considered the best.
To most of our present day architects,
the problem of building a building that
would withstand the earthquakes would
be impossible to solve, but to Wright it
offered a challenge. Here, at last, was
a chance to prove the value of his new
form, and it was imperative that form
must follow function. He expresses his
feelings toward the industrial designer's
cry of "No new style," when he says,

signers have grown up to the point
where they have known and made
friends with the limitations characteris-
tic of their job, will America have any
style in industry. Without limitation,
the artist has no problem. Never create
without realizing the limitation of the
field." s
Wright spent about seven years in
the Orient, and about five of these years
were spent in building the Imperial
Hotel. He found that just beneath the
rather firm crust of Japan's soil lay a
soft layer of mud. He decided it should
be possible to use this layer of mud as a
cushion against the tremors of the earth.
He made hundreds of tests,and finally
decided that by use of his Cantilever
Construction, he could float the building
on a cushion of mud. To better under-
stand this principle, here is how Wright,
himself, describes it. "The Cantilever
is most romantic—most free—of all
principles of construction, and in this
case is the most sensible. The waiter's
tray supported by his hand at the cen-
ter is a Cantilever slab in principle, and
so concrete Cantilever slabs continous
across the building from side to side,
supported in that way, became the
structure of the Imperial Hotel at
Tokyo."'
When the hotel withstood a great
earthquake, Wright was proclaimed
throughout Japan as the greatest mod-
ern architect, and even in his own coun-
try he was recognized more widely.
With this great success he began in-
dustrial designing with much greater re-
turns. He built the Johnson Wax Com-
pany building at Racine, Wisconsin. It
is a new form of office building with a
low and streamlined appearance. It was
built of brick of a soft-red color and il-
luminated by two horizontal bands of
glass tubing which encircle the entire
building.8 In this building, he applied
all his knowledge about new materials
such as plastics, glass, ferro or armored
concrete, and red bricks. The natural
color of the bricks gave the building
the blending of it and its surroundings
that is found in all of Wright's build-
ings.
"There is this distinction at the start
between the architecture which accepts
and the architecture which creates.
The architecture which accepts may pro-
duce splendid skyscrapers, free of gew-
gaws of dead styles, using materials and
techniques for their intrinsic values—
but such a building's beauty and isola-
20
tion must be rooted in the jungle below;
it may shut out the sunlight from win-
dows where it is needed, add to the bur-
den of human life by creating conges-
tion, and really ignore basic human
values altogether."■
Frand Lloyd Wright has opened a
door for the American people. In their
mad dash toward an unknown goal, the
American people have forgotten to build
up a lasting foundation. They are al-
ways pulling forward with their hands
and ever leaving their feet dangling in
space. They have had unlimited chance
ot study the failures of other civiliza-
tions, but seem, nevertheless, to care
little about preserving their own. It
seems that we are not old enough, in a
cultural sense, to recognize our own men
of Art. Wright symbolizes the modern
American race in his work, but we hesi-
tate to accept him. He has proven to us
that through our inventions, production
lines, and precision tools we can produce
a truly beautiful art form. He has given
us an "Architecture of Democracy,"
this is indeed a great step toward our
cultural foundation. In his own way he
tells the future architects of America
that their Art is just beginning.
"The day of the individual is not over
—instead, it is just about to begin. The
machine does not write the doom of
Liberty, but is waiting at man's hand as
a peerless tool, for him to use to put
foundations beneath a genuine Democ-
racy. Then the Machine may conquer
human drudgery to some purpose, tak-
ing it upon itself to broaden, lengthen,
strengthen, and deepen the life of the
simple man. What limits do we dare
imagine to an art that is organic fruit
of an adequate life for the individual?
Although the power is now murderous,
changed to botch-work and bungler's
ambitions, the creative artist will take
it surely in his hand and, in the name of
Liberty swiftly undo the deadly mis-
chief it has created." I0

A case from modern industry shows how time studies can step up war
production by providing a means for more efficient arrangement of work.
The present demand for increased ef-
ficiency in all types of work has brought
about a widespread interest in motion
and time study. The need for higher
production rates requires that every job
and every operation be examined with
the aim of getting supplies to the battle-
fronts quicker. As summarized in the
Accountant's Handbook, "Jobs must be
studied both for the sake of finding out
just what they are and how they are per-
formed, and for the purpose of improv-
ing the technique of the workmen, so as
to enable them to put out the product
with less exertion, a smaller amount of
waste motion, and a minimum of waste
materials. All the mechanism of scien-
tific management as it applies to labor
may be utilized. Time studies are essen-
tial. Wage payment methods must be
studied with a view to their effect upon
efficiency of labor. Unscientific methods
of wage determination must be scrapped.
Incentive payment plans are often found
desirable." Motion and time study pro-
vides a technique that is unequalled for
finding the most economical methods
and for measuring labor accomplish-
ment.
The terms "time study" and "motion
study" have been given many interpre-
tations since their origin. Time study is
mainly used for rate setting and motion
study for improving methods. Motion
and time study stands for the analysis
of the methods, materials and equip-
ment used in the performance of a piece
of work. An analysis of the movements
made by the worker in performing the
work constitutes the preliminary ap-
proach to the problem of finding the
best way of doing the work, his analy-
sis of movements is called "motion
study." This study seeks to find all the
unneccessary motions which may be
eliminated and to find a sequence of
motions which will give maximum effi-
ciency. Of course, consideration of the
materials and equipment is also neces-
sary in finding the cheapest way. The
determination of the method of greatest
economy for a specific job, giving con-
sideration to all factors affecting the
work and the operator, constitutes the
first part of motion and time study.
Once the "best way" is found, a rec-
ord of the approved method is made.
This record, known as the "written
standard practice" preserves all the
pertinent information about the motions
employed, and the tools, fixtures, and
other equipment used. The "written
standard practice," which is the second
element of motion and time study, is the
most practical way of maintaining the
standards once they have been set.
Motion and time study also includes
that important element of scientific
management, the determination of time
standards, more commonly known as
"rate setting." By one of several meth-
ods, the time required by the average
worker to do the job is determined, due
allowances being made for such things
as personal time, fatigue, and delay, so
that the worker can maintain the set
rate indefinitely without undue fatigue.
Another use to which time and motion
study is put is the training of new em-
ployees. Large industries are making
greater use of motion study in training
employees now than ever before, and
amazing results are being obtained.
When motion and time study is used
under the direction of competent engi-
neers, it frequently happens that pre-
liminary studies lead to a redesign of
the product and of the manufacturing
layout. An example of such an investi-
gation and the resulting layout and
product alterations is the one described
below.
This work was done before the war
at a plant producing peacetime goods,
but the method used serves to show how-
engineers today are expediting the pro-
duction of war materials all over the
country. Present shortages of manpower
and materials make it imperative that
all waste of both quantities be elimi-
nated.

American colleges turn out good engi-
neers. That's why so many of the world's
greatest engineering achievements stand
to America's credit.
The world of the future will be a world
of wheels and wings to an extent that
cannot be completely foreseen now. But
one thing is sure—it will be a world
of bearings, too, for wherever wheels or
shafts turn, they must turn on bearings.
It is not too much to say, in view of
their present dominant position, that it
will be a world of Timken Tapered
Roller Bearings; for there is no bear-
ing requirement that Timken Bearings
cannot meet.
So, while you are still studying, learn to
know your Timken Bearings thoroughly
—their design, application and potential-
ities. Then you'll be still better equipped
for your job when college days are over
and you take up the responsibilities of

ing was devoted to the assembly of rec-
ord changers and home recorders, and
most of the parts were manufactured in
the die casting and stamping depart-
ments of the corporation.
When I was first employed by the
New Products Corporation as time-
keeper in the Record Changer Depart-
ment, the last few thousand of the old
models were being manufactured. A
new model, known as the "Litlenel
Changer" had just been approved by
our chief customer and an order had
been received. It was my job to set time
standards and piece rates on the assem-
bly operations when the first production
parts came through.
Mr. Wm. Pope, the plant supervisor,
had decided that production costs could
be reduced greatly if the plant layout
were changed. A process chart covering
the complete department was made up
showing the flow of work from operation
to operation, from receiving inspection
to shipping. We made small scale tem-
plates of all stationary equipment and
arranged the new layout so that all dis-
tances travelled were reduced to a mini-
mum and excess handling eliminated.
When the new layout was approved by
Superintendent Dill and Manager Red
del, we commenced the work on an
operation analysis. It was necessary
that this be completed as soon as pos-
sible so that the necessary tools and fix-
tures could be made in time to meet
the contract date for delivery of the first
new models.
For about a week the plant managers
worked on the sample production model,
putting it together and taking it apart
several dozen times. Notes on their
suggestions concerning correct assembly
procedure were made and served as the
basis for the organization of assembly
operations. Several parts of the record
changer had to be redesigned to facili-
tate rapid assembly. A company with a
larger engineering department would
have had more of this assembly planning
done there.
About two weeks after we had re-
ceived the first production model, we
were ready to set up the trial assembly
line. We made time and motion studies
of the operations so that sub-assembly,
line assembly, and packing operations
could be synchronized. After a few more
changes we were ready for full scale
production.
With the aid of "written standard
practices," the employees were trained
in their new jobs. About six weeks
after we started on the job, the plant
was going full speed. Two hundred and
fifty employees had been trained and,
except for certain wrinkles in the opera-
tion and adjustment of the new machine,
production was going smoothly enough
to make piece rate setting practical.
About thirty per cent of the direct
labor was spent on sub-assemblies, and
since each sub assembly was run inde-
pendently of the others, it was decided
that these operations should be timed
for piece rates first. A simple routine
was used in making these studies. A
standard observation sheet was used.
After recording all pertinent data, the
stop watch was started. At the end of
each element of work in the cycle the

reading of the watch was recorded. The
watch was run continuously and so, after
about a dozen cycles, the total time was
recorded. There are two methods for
determining the base time, or working
time per piece, from those data. One
way is to divide the total time by the
number of pieces. This method is used
successfully if a large number of short
cycles are observed with no available
interruptions to interfere. But if the
cycle is long enough to give accurate
timing for each of the elements of the
operation, it is considered better to se-
lect a time which is known as the
"model time." This means simply to se-
lect the time that occurs most frequently
for each of the elements and then to add
them all together to get the total time
for the cycle. We used the latter method
almost exclusively.
The sample time study sheet illus-
trates the method used. The operation
was to spray paint for a crinkle surface
on the R-76 tone arm. The cycle was
broken down into the elements noted.
The painter took a tone arm from an ad-
jacent stack and placed it on a turn-
table in the spray booth. He then un-
hooked the paint gun from a peg on the
side of the booth and painted the arm,
turning the table about with his left
hand. The painter rehooked his gun
and while he was getting the next tone
arm, his helper removed the painted
one.
In addition to the cycle elements,
there were various other items which
could not be neglected, such as obtain-
ing a new tote box of parts and turning
the large dolly holding the trays of
painted arms around so that the trays
on the other side could be filled. It is
impossible to obtain true base times if
such foreign elements are neglected.
Once the time for these elements is de-
termined, it is prorated to the cycle. For
example, if it took 0.4 minute to turn

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


In AN AGE of progress in many fields, no advances have
been more helpful to man than those made in medicine and
surgery.
One of the forces that has made it possihle for this prog-
ress to be rapid is synthetic organic chemistry. This science
has provided those who manufacture pharmaceuticals with
means of obtaining many new chemical materials from which
to produce new chemical combinations. Synthetic organic
chemicals are priceless raw materials in the eternal fight for
health.
Through the use of synthetic organic chemicals, many
anesthetics have been developed. The number of these anes-
thetics is of great value, since the physician can choose one
suited to the patient's needs. This means less shock and
greater comfort for the patient, thus often contributing to
bis swifter recovery.
Many other pharmaceuticals are made with the help of
synthetic organic chemicals. Anti- malarial substances, syn-
thetic adrenalin, man-made vitamins, anti-pyretics (to cut
down fever), many kinds of sedatives, vehicles in which
drugs are administered, and solvents used in extracting drugs
from natural sources are some of the medicinal aids made
possible by these chemicals.
CARBIDE AND CARBON CHEMICALS CORPORATION, the Unit
of L CC which pioneered in the field of synthetic organic
chemistry, has made more than 160 synthetic organic chem-
icals available in commercial quantities. Many of these
chemicals are important in various ways in the pharmaceu-
tical industry.
Pharmaceutical manufacturers, and research and technical
men in chemical and allied industries, arc invited to semi for a
copy of the 1 00-page liooklet P-2, "'Synthetic Organ ic Client icals,''
which technically descrilx-s the properties and some of tlte uses
of these cliemicals in pharmaceutical and other fields.

total base time. Then an allowance
must be made for normal delays, fa-
tigue, and personal time for going to
the lavatory or getting a drink. Usually
a uniform personal allowance and fa-
tigue allowance is applied to all jobs.
The standard time is then determined
from the base time by adding these rat-
ings and allowances.
It would be well to mention here that
the observer must make a careful check
to see that no elements of the cycle or
other associated elements are over-
looked. Otherwise, the standard time
will be too fast, and this results in con-
siderable grief to time study man, fore-
man, and operator alike. Also all infor-
mation relating to materials, tools, and
equipment used must be accurately re-
corded to prevent any future disagree-
ment over the set rate.
It must be admitted that the making
of allowances (called "leveling") is a
very difficult task. If a dishonest opera-
tor is being observed, the difficulty is in-
creased manifold. Leveling requires
very gix)d judgment, and this comes only
after much experience in time study.
Because of this difficulty, extreme care
must be taken and reference to any pro-
duction records on similar work should
be made to check for errors. In any
event, it is essential that the manage-
ment be willing to rectify errors or to
demonstrate the correctness of the time
standard. The workers must have con-
fidence in the standards and in the men
who make them.
In New Products, we set the rate and
then filed the time study. If the data
from several stop watch studies are to
give maximum return for the effort ex-
pended in obtaining them, they must be
compiled in such a way that studies of
many similar operations can be com-
pared. If this is done, standard time
can be determined for similar classes of
work differing perhaps in such details
as machining or number of holes drilled.
When I had completed the sub assem-
bly time studies, the main assembly line
was functioning smoothly enough to be
time studied, so I was assigned the job
of determining a correct production rate
for the line assembly. There were some
twenty girls on the assembly line. I
made a careful analysis of each girl's
operation and then timed each element
in ten different cycles. After applying
the ratings and allowances, it became
apparent that some of the girls had more
work to do than the others. In some
cases this was concealed by the fact
that a slow worker would not be carry-
ing her full share, having shifted it to
an adjacent operator. When we finally
got the line balanced, it was decided
that fifty changers an hour should be
the standard production rate, and on all
those in excess of fifty per hour a bonus
was granted. I had unusual success for
a beginner in such work and it was
probably due in a great part to the
splendid cooperation of the assemblers.
It should be apparent to the reader
that time and motion study is a potent
tool in industrial engineering. By using
it, New Products was able to put an en-
tirely new and different type of record
changer into mass production in a few
weeks with a minimum cost.
Since a business man's chief interest
in any business is in its relation to profit-
making, the engineer in his employ must
recognize the value of motion and time
study in reducing manufacturing costs
and speeding up production.

Chemistry and Industrial Evolution
Industry has been free to use its own resources
for new developments—to engage in research—
to examine, reject or adopt new ideas. Common-
place necessities which do not lend themselves
to fundamental change are improved by new
production methods and the use of new mate-
trials. This freedom of action has kept industry
from becoming static.
Industrial chemistry is more susceptible to this
evolutionary process than perhaps any other
enterprise. By developing new materials, test
tubes generate fresh energy for the advance-
ment of industry at large. From these materials,
new products often evolve. There is no stronger
testimony to the place of chemistry in this
process than the more than 500 products pro-
duced by Dow—chemicals indispensable to
Industry and Victory.

pattern for destruction
From the toluene plant, via patrol
boat, to enemy submarines—ending up
in a "bloom of death"—that's the pat-
tern that is clearing the seas of the mul-
titudinous undersea raiders which once
played such havoc with our merchant
shipping. We have almost forgotten the
days of the summer of 1942 when tor-
pedoes were striking their marks four
and five times a day.
However, no such success can last
very long, for the tempo of research and
development is proportional to the urg-
ency of the demand. When any new
weapon achieves such phenomenal suc-
cess, it is not long before a defense
against it is perfected. Then, if this
counter is effective, it is soon outmoded
by new weapons.
Such a short-lived weapon, or per-
haps, if events dictate, a permanent
component of our ever expanding fleet,
is the Navy's new destroyer-escort ves-
sel, pictured below. Smaller than a de-
stroyer, yet larger and more powerful
than the British corvette, the DE's are
unique in their ability to carry out swift
and effective attacks. They are pre-
pared to pick off enemy raiders on the
surface, in the air, or in the depths.
Although primarily designed for anti-
submarine work, they are fitted with
the large batteries of anti-aircraft units
which are typical of all modern vessels.
Torpedo tubes and five-inch main bat-
teries complete the armament.
These 1700 ton exterminators are
800 feet long, with a beam of 35 feet.
The first of the series was launched in
April of this year, and they are being
turned out at about twice the rate of
destroyer production.
electricity gets a shock
Much as an electrical engineer hates
to admit it, there have been a few appli-
cations in which electricity has been
superseded by something better. Per-
haps the oldest known electrical device
is the mariners' compass and it of course
played a tremendous part in the history
of the world. Today it is being rapidly-
displaced by the gyroscopic compass for
all important work. Interurban electric
cars for a time were an important means
of transportation. Today they have been
driven out by the automobile* Electric
drive for ships seems to have seen its
best days, perhaps because we can now
make better and cheaper gears. How-
ever, the gyroscopic compass could not
function without electricity, the auto-
mobile without electric ignition and
lighting would be in a bad way, and we
could hardly manufacture gears without
electric motors to drive our machine
tools, so those of us who depend upon
electricity for our living are not worry-
ing.

As one student to another
Because we know so well what changes
have taken place on your campus and how
they must be affecting your view of things,
we would like to remind you of something.
Alcoa Aluminum probably means to you
now just a whale of a lot of aluminum that
is going into war tools.
But Alcoa, the company, is people.
And we have a long-time goal—a very
human, peacetime goal we are saving in
the hope of sharing with you. We would
like you to think of us as Imagineers in
aluminum, creators of employment and
higher standards of living.
Alcoa is, first of all, a great collection
of engineering knowledge based on experi-
ence that goes back to the birth of alumi-
num as a commercially available metal.
Then, it is imagination. It is the vision
that sees aluminum, not as just another
metal to sell but as a means of eliminating
dead weight, or corrosion; as a means of
reducing maintenance costs or increasing
output.
The full significance of Alcoa can be
summed up as experience in the application
of aluminum to make more things available
to more people. It's what we consider the
only means of solving the perennial employ-
ment problem.
It requires constant inquiry. Constant
study. Constant co-operation with every
field of human effort that uses metal.
The results are as practical a way of
bringing about a better world as any yet
devised.
We hope, when we both return to the
job of rebuilding the world, some of you
will choose to do it with aluminum. That
will mean, of course, with Alcoa.

17D, B-17C, and on back to the "299"
itself, the grandfather of them all.
Perhaps the story of the development
of the B-17 might best be told by re-
viewing these earlier models.
The first three planes which may be
included as forerunners of the Flying
Fortress are the Monomail, the Boeing
B-9 and the Boeing B-247, all mail and
passenger transports. All of these, al-
though at the time of origin they were
considered to be great advancements in
aeronautical engineering, really served
to furnish data on all-metal construction
and on the design of heavier and faster
planes which could be applied to new
models.
Engineers gained confidence by the
success of these planes; and in 1934,
when the Army placed an order for a
new multi-engined bomber, they decided
to build a super airplane, a giant with
four motors.
The "299," as this monster was called,
surpassed even the expectations of its
builders, exceeding all other planes app-
roaching it in size in maneuverability,
speed, range, climb, and load capacity.
Then, just before the Army was to pass
judgement, an Air Corps pilot attempted

The "Boeing 299" was the predecessor of the modern "Fortress."
to take off with the controls locked, and
the plane was wrecked.
This error did not prevent the adop-
tion of the design, however, for the plane
had proven its capabilities. The Army
ordered 13 bombers of this type, incorp-
orating many improvements and giving
it the number YB-17.
There was no rest in experimentation
on these new planes, and soon the YB-
17A was brought out, setting world's
records for speed, altitude and load-
carrying ability. At high altitudes the
B-17A could run from the fastest pur-
suit planes.
The Flying Fortress continued in its
development down through the B-17B,
B-17C and B-17D with the addition of
plexiglas machine gun blisters, higher
powered engines, greater fire power,
leak-proof fuel tanks, and many other
design improvements.
The B-17E, another link in the fort-
ress chain, featured heavier armament,
including a tail gun installation which
protected a vulnerable spot. A larger
rudder also provided greater stability
and improved bombardment accuracy.
A refined turbo-supercharger permitted
combat flying at over 35,000 feet.
The advent of the "F" model in 1941.
having over 800 design changes, assured
the Amercian Air Force of a potent off-
ensive weapon in case of war.
That war did come, even sooner than
expected, and today the Flying Fortress,
grandson of the "299," is proving its
value to our military forces.

The loss of recoverable alloys in steel scrap has
been a major problem confronting the various
conservation agencies. Proper segregation of scrap
is one effective answer.
Segregation of scrap at the source is compara-
tively simple. The difficulty comes in preventing
mix-ups in subsequent handlings. They can be
prevented or remedied by applying two simple
tests—spark and spot.
The presence of molybdenum, or nickel, or both,
is readily detected by spark testing. Molybdenum
causes an easily recognized secondary burst at the
end of the spark stream resembling a spearpoint.
CLIMAX FURNISHES AUTHORITATIVE ENGINEERING
DATA ON MOLYBDENUM APPLICATIONS.

Nickel produces a spot of intensely white light in
the stream near the grinding wheel.
Both elements have a tendency, in the higher
contents, to suppress the supplemental bursts
characteristic of carbon steels.
Several spot tests for molybdenum have been
developed. The simpler ones depend on the red
color produced by either potassium ethyl xantho-
genate or sodium thiocyanate added to a molyb-
date obtained from the etched surface of the steel.
The dimethyl glyoxime test for nickel also depends
on a red coloration. Many of these tests are
approximately quantitative.

Absent-minded aviators now find their
planes lit up like pre-war Times Square,
for warning lights are being installed on
military aircraft to indicate inumerable
dangerous conditions. If the pilot tries
to land without his landing-gear down
and locked, he is warned by a signal
light on the dash board. Likewise, he is
notified if his flaps are not down, if oil
or fuel pressure is low, if he is low on
gasoline, if the oxygen supply has dimin-
ished, or if any number of other pieces
of equipment are not functioning prop-
erly.
These indicators, however, must be
carefully designed. They must be built
to incite the pilot's reflexes so that he
makes the proper adjustments; that is.

1) This little iron bowl helped
shape the pattern of industry to-
day; it holds the key to much of
the progress that is to come. For
in it Dr. E. G. Acheson created the
first man-made abrasive, silicon
carbide, to which he gave the
trade name "Carborundum"—52 years
ago. From that discovery in turn
came the super refractories which
opened the way for the economical
development of modern metallurbi-
cal processes.
'

2) For instance, one of these
super refractories is vitally
important to the process by
which our huge naval and coast
defense guns are annealed

The Naval custom of removing lights
from their sockets, to prevent their be-
ing damaged during gunnery practice,
has been made unnecessary by modern
''rough service" lamps. These tough
globes are built to withstand the heav-
iest shocks, and they were developed
with the aid of a "torture wheel'' which
simulates battle conditions. Lamps are
mounted in the wheeel along the rim,
and it is revolved and periodically drop-
ped an appropriate distance.
Such shock-proof light bulbs are in
demand also for use on railroads and
subways, which, as any communter
knows, suffer as severe shocks and vi-
bration as could be expected in the most
heated battle.

drove the bulldozer through the under-

PROF. A. H. WHITE
Retired Chairman of the Department of Chemical Engineering
How far has Engineering progressed? A look into the past gives some clue to its future.
This University was founded as this
state emerged from the wilderness, and
for more than a century it has made a
notable contribution to our country by
training young men who have become
leaders in the development of the state
and of the nation. It was not until the
University had been in existence for
more than eighty years that Engineer-
ing became sufficiently differentiated to
warrant its recognition as a separate
college. This late recognition of Engi-
neering has prevailed in most of our
universities, because Engineering has de-
veloped only in relatively recent years.
It is this period of development which I
hope to discuss with you.
When I tell you that it is more than
fifty years since I completed by under-
graduate college course, and that I have
had personal contact with Engineering
during fifty years, you will, I am sure,
believe that I am even older than you
had feared and that I am appearing be-
fore you as a mummy from the remote
past. It is true that in the light of the
modern developments in which you live,
my college days will seem to you unbe-
lievably crude. Our class rooms were
lit by flickering gas jets, street cars were
drawn by horses over streets thick with
mud in spring and dust in summer.
There were no radios, no automobiles,
no moving pictures. We did not even
have a football stadium.
When I considered how I might pre-
sent graphically to this audience the
extraordinary acceleration of engineer-
ing progress since I left college, it be-
came evident that it was necessary to
go much further back into history to
gain the proper perspective, and it oc-
curred to me that the football grid-
iron presented a frame of reference with
which you were certainly familiar and
whose use you might even accept as a
tribute of admiration to your well-
known ability to shine on that field.
Let us take the SO yard line of the
field as representing the present time
with the past running towards the goal
posts at the right and the future stretch-
ing to the left. We must now set some
scale of time, and I have chosen to let
each yard represent 100 years, so that
the goal line on our right represents a
period about 5000 years ago.

Left—Modern miracle, the linotype
machine, makes possible "the wide
dissemination of accumulated knowl-
edge."
ALFRED HOLMES WHITE, until
kis retirement last year, ivas one of
the most active and outstanding
members of the University of
Michigan faculty. In this article,
which teas originally presented as
an address before the engineering
students at /Volre Dame, he presents
the experiences, impressions, and
conclusions of his fifty years of
engineering practice.
Even at that remote date man had
considerable achievements in engineer-
ing to his credit, for the great pyramid
of Cheops in Egypt was already 600
years old. As we come up the field to-
ward the present, we find ourselves on
the 20 yard line in the era of King
Solomon and on the 25 yard line in the
Golden Age of Greece. On the 30 yard
line we are witb Julius Caesar invading
Britain, and another step brings us into
the Christian era. The Roman empire
falls and we pass through the dark ages
and emerge on the 45 yard line in the
glory of the Renaissance. The first
printed books have just appeared, and
before we cross the 46 yard line we may
have had an opportunity to see that in-
comparable genius, both as artist and
engineer, Leonardo da Vinci, and if we
were venturesome we might have accom-
panied Columbus on his voyage of dis-
covery to America.
Let us pause a moment to consider
the state of Engineering on our hypo-
thetical 46 yard line. How far have we
progressed since the pyramids were built
more than 5000 years before? The an-
swer is that engineering had made al-
most no progress. The ships in which
Columbus sailed the seas were hardly
larger than those used by the Phoeni-
cians. The great cathedrals which had
commenced to dot Europe were more
beautiful architecturally than the tem-
ples of the Egyptians, but they were still
built of stones cut by hand and put in
place by the labor of many men. The
one great step in the progress of Engi-
neering which had been made up to and
in this time was not the work of an engi-
neer: it was the invention of printing
which made possible the wide dissemina-
tion of accumulated knowledge.
Let us step forward another pace—
to the 47 yard line, 300 years ago. The
year 1642 is an important date in our
time schedule, for in that year the great
mathematician and astronomer Galileo
MARCH, 1944


Sir Isaac Newton was born. These two
names herald the advent of experimental
science. The Greeks were wonderful
thinkers and perhaps no one has ever
had a more brilliant mind than Aris-
totle. But the Greeks believed that man
by the sheer force of his intellect could
solve the problems of the physical uni-
verse and therefore did not think it
necessary to make careful observations
or to conduct experiments to determine
physical laws. This attitude blocked the
progress of science and of engineering
for centuries. It was not until 300 years
ago that experimental science com-
menced to give us useful information
and printed books were ready to dis-
seminate the knowledge that had been
acquired.
But before engineering could do great
things it had to have more concentrated
power than could be yielded by groups
of men or animals, or the small water-
mills which in turn had be small be-
cause their machinery had be to be
fabricated by the hands of men, unaided
by power-driven equipment.
Let us step forward to the 48 yard
line where we find a small boy named
James Watt who was to strike the
shackles from the hands of the engineer
by giving him concentrated power.
Strictly speaking, Watt did not invent
the steam engine, but he did bring it
into the realm of practicability. James
Watt was an instrument maker at the
University of Glasgow, and one of his
assignments was to repair the model of
an early type steam engine. He pon-
dered over its inefficiency, and now I
quote from one of his letters telling of
his conception of his invention in May,
176S.
"I had gone to take a walk on a
fine Sabbath afternoon—when the
idea came into my mind that as steam
was an elastic body, it would rush
into a vacuum, and if a communica-
tion was made between the cylinder
and an exhausted vessel, it would rush
into it and might there be condensed
without cooling the cylinder. ... I
had not walked further than the Golf
House when the whole thing was ar-
ranged in my mind.''
Remember that James Watts was an
instrument maker and therefore was an
acurate man. He was also a good busi-
ness man and was fortunate in secur-
ing the interest of James Boulton, who
owned one of the largest iron works in
Great Britain. With his aid, Watt
started out to build a practicable steam
engine. Note his difficulties. In one of
his letters written four years later, tell-
ing of a new cast iron cylinder for his
experimental engine, he writes that it
was:
"near one-eighth inch wider at one
end than it was at the other.'7
And yet he had to try to use this de-
fective cylinder because the boring mil!
had not been developed.
Watt's rapid progress was continu-
ally blocked by the lack of heavy and
substantial machine tools, which could
not be fabricated because steel could
be made only in small units. After twen-
ty-five years of effort, there were only
five steam engines in all of England and
Scotland.
Now we come to the 49 yard line,
representing the period 100 years ago.
The steam engine had commenced to
exert its influence. The Atlantic Ocean
had been crossed by a vessel powered by
a steam engine of 50 horse power. Rail-
roads were being built, drawn by loco-
motives operating at the dangerously
high boiler pressure of 12 pounds to the
square inch. Cannon were made of cast
iron, muskets were not rifled, and black
gunpowder was the only material for
propellant powder and bursting charges.
Further progress was again being
blocked by the lack of large ingots of
steel.
This was the situation on the 49 yard
line ,with only one yard to go to bring
us to the present. Let us move forward
one foot. Within this period Henry
Bessemer, seeking to improve cast iron
for manufacturing cannon, invented hi?

weakened on land—and greatly expanded in the air."

the steam engine as a milestone in the
history of engineering. By his process,
ten tons of molten pig iron could in a
few minutes be converted to molten steel
from which large steel castings could be
poured. With these large castings,
larger machine tools could be built, and
with heavy machine tools, heavy steel
beams and plates could be rolled, and
thus, large structures became possible.
Progress is being made more rapidly
at this period, but there is still a
rather long time interval between a dis-
covery and its widespread utilization. I
call to your attention one of the most
noteworthy exhibits at the Centennial
Exhibition held in the city of Philadal-
phia in 1876 to celebrate the one hun-
dredth anniversary of our Declaration
of Independence. This center of interest
among the exhibits was a-giant steam en-
gine, a giant even today, for it weighed
600 tons (1,200,000 pounds) and when
it was shipped to Philadelphia, the vari-
ous parts filled 35 freight cars. But
what was the power of this marvellous
giant? Only 1400 horsepower, less than
that of one of our modern engines which
take an airplane into the sky. And
what was the reason for this tremendous
weight and small power? One reason
was that the steam pressure was only 50
pounds per square inch. And why was
the steam pressure still so low? Because
although Bessemer had invented his
steel process 20 years before, engineers
were still using this new material only
timidly and were only slowly developing
the potentialities of steel as a structural
material.
We are now only two feet from the
50 yard line representing the present
time and are dealing with events which
have occurred in my own lifetime. The
first commercial electric lighting plant
started operating in N'ew York when I
was nine years old, and the wide-spread
use of electrical power is, of course, still
more recent. The automobile, the air-
plane, and radio transmission of mes-
sages, all had their beginning in my life-
time and much of their development in
yours. Few of you can remember further
back than six inches on our gridiron
time scale, and yet you can all recall no-
table improvements in automobiles, air-
planes, motion pictures and radio re-
ception which have taken place in this
last six inches.
This rapid progress seems natural to
you, and the query arises as to why
progress was so slow in former centuries,
but bear in mind that the intellects of

Courtesy oj AUTOMOTIVE WAR PRODUCTION
"The weapons have been improved, but the procedures remain the same."
your generation are probably no better
'than the minds of the educated groups
in Greece two thousand years ago, when
practically no progress was being made
in engineering. The astonishing develop-
ment of engineering in this last two feet
of our gridiron time scheme is due to the
accelerated accumulation of knowledge
and its dissemination among continually
larger groups of people competent to
apply this knowledge. Each bit of
knowledge is a potential building stone,
and as the number of trained minds and
the number of building stones increase,
the resulting structures become progres-
sively more numerous and more impor-
tant.
Medicine and law were recognized
professions five thousand years ago. En-
gineering has emerged as a distinct pro-
fession only in the last hundred years
and has been recognized as a distin-
guished profession almost within your
own lifetime.
And now as to the future. A Negro
preacher once introduced a guest speaker
as one "who knowed the unknowable,
could do the undoable, and unscrew
the inscrutable." I do not pretend to
have any mystic ability to forecast the
future, and I ask you merely to review
with me those forces which seen certain
to continue for at least a limited time,
and then consider the effect of these
forces on our future progress. We know,
as engineers, that a graph can be extrap-
olated with considerable accuracy for a
short distance, provided there are no
powerful new forces introduced to cause
a violent upheaval in conditions which
have traced the graph in the past.
We have reviewed the rapid acceler-
ation of technological progress as sci-
ence developed and as increasing num-
bers of scientists and engineers gave
their energies to making useful applica-
tions of scientific discoveries. The World
War has diverted the energies of our
research groups to specific fields con-
tributing to the war effort, and in
some of the invaded countries, prog-
ress has been almost eliminated by
the repression of the conquerors. In
our own country, however, research
is working at top speed, and so many
of the war developments will have
peace time applications that we can look
forward with confidence to many won-
derful developments in many fields in
the near future.
The advances in electronics are to
have great and immediate effects in the
development of radio transmission and
especially in television. In industrial
operations, the electron tube will give
us unbelievable accuracy in the auto-
matic control of industrial operations.
Important developments in the trans-
mission of electrical energy are forecast
through electronic converters which ef-
ficiently convert alternating to direct
current or reverse the process. The de-
velopments in plastics, synthetic fibers,
synthetic rubber, and synthetic motor
fuels have caught the popular imagina-
tion, and rightly so, for they are the re-
sult of developments which would have
been considered most visionary only
twenty years ago.
The manufacturers of plastics have
studied the methods of building up giant
molecules from smaller groups to make

WILLIAM D. HALL
Chief Engineer, Aeronca Aircraft Corporation
Published by permission of Society of Automotive Engineers
Light planes of the future will be safe, comfortable, efficient, but expensive.
Here's the story, straight from the manufacturers.
Reasonably soon after the termina-
tion of the war, the individual will have
a choice of aircraft for his private use
which will be vastly superior to that to
which he has been accustomed in the
past. Although immediate wartime de-
velopments have not been concerned
with the private type aircraft, the explo-
sive rate at which the aircraft industry
has progressed has brought to light
many improvements which will be ap-
plied to the private airplane. These de-
velopments, together with those occur-
ring naturally in a field of intense com-
petition—most aviation leaders feel that
the private plane postwar competition
will be terriffic—will be bound to result
in a number of models from which the
public can choose.
As our present job is to win the war
so that we can have the opportunity to
buy our own private airplane, we are
able to do only a limited amount of de-
velopment on the future's aircraft. Fur-
ther, if we could completely develop a
design, there would not be sufficient
personnel to tool a factory, nor could we
obtain the materials with which to start
production the moment the "go ahead"
is given. Hence, the immediate postwar
market will be supplied with ships which
are identical or slightly modified from
those offered in 1940 and early 1941.
You are all familiar with this particular
condition, as it is not one pertinent only
to aircraft manufacturers.
Although these ships can take many
forms, the important ones are the "fixed
wing" type, and the "rotating wing"
type, such as the helicopter. Although
considerable publicity has been given
the recent advances of the helicopter, I
feel that they are still a long way from
offering the best compromise from the
standpoint of the private owner, and
that the fixed wing type will dominate
the immediate future. Therefore, the
remainder of this discussion is perti-
nent primarily to the fixed wing type air-
craft.
The following types, at least, will be
offered to the postwar public:
1. A low powered, inexpensive train-
ing type aircraft, with either tandem
or side-by-side seating arrangement
which will be a refined version of the
prewar light airplane models. This
airplane will sell at approximately one
thousand dollars, and in order to meet
this cost, will consist of the minimum
amount of aircraft that will satisfac-
torily fly.
2. A medium priced, medium per-
formance type aircraft which will be
super-safe, and aimed at the private
owner, and will be available in two-
place, and four or five-place models.
The two-place version will list at ap-
proximately fifteen hundred dollars
and the larger ships at approximately
three thousand.
The performance of this type of
ship will be compromised to some ex-
tent to obtain maximum safety and
comfort. As the development and
tooling costs of this type of aircraft
are amortized, the price will move
downward, but probably will not
reach the desirable level, one thou-
sand dollars for the two-place and two
thousand for the larger ships, for
some time.
3. An airplane combining as high
performance as is consistent with rea-
sonable safety, comfort, and cost, will
be available at approximately two
thousand dollars. This aircraft will be
a "cleaned-up" version of the pre-war
two-place, side-by-side, low wing, re-
tractable gear type, and will be of-
fered for those persons who will de-
mand maximum performance.
The standards of design in acceptance
heretofore in the private aircraft will be
superseded by much higher ones, as it is
only by these higher standards that the
inherent difficulties of the aircraft will
be minimized to the point where the
average person can easily operate one.
The ideal airplane will be that one which
is the best compromise between safety,
cost, performance, dependability, and
comfort, for the purpose for which it if
intended.
safety
Before anyone will accept anything
new, he satisfies himself that neither he
nor his family will encounter any greater
risks than he is used to. Therefore it
will be necessary to develop the public's
airplanes so that they will feel no more
uncomfortable in them, so far as per-
sonal hazards go, than when they are in
their automobile or bathtub.
Because aircraft operate in a three
dimensional medium, man, who is a two
dimensional creature by heredity, find.--
there are a greater number of natural
hazards than he is accustomed to with
surface vehicles. A student pilot finds
this to be the case, since he has t&lt;&gt;
be continually reminded to control the
altitude of the airplane as well as the
direction and attitude, as he is used to
controlling only his direction. Further,
the student is beset with the fact that
the conventional type aircraft is con-
trollable and stable only within a very
limited range of possible attitudes into
which it can be placed; and hence he
must be trained very carefully to stay
within these limitations.
This problem offers two pure solu-
tions: one of which is to rigorously train
the pilot, and the other, to modify the
airplane so that it automatically keeps
ihe operator out of trouble. The first
solution has prevailed to date due to lim-
ited knowledge of the designers, al-
though it is not the best answer. The
second solution is desirable but of a
Utopian nature, and hence is the one we
wish to strive for although we will pos-
sibly never reach it completely.
The primary form of loss of control
is the stall, followed by the spin. Sta-
12
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


istration show that the majority of acci-
dents have occurred from loss of con-
trol in the form of a stall when the air-
craft is close to the ground. At least a
partial solution was well under way in
the immediate prewar aircraft in the
form of spin-proof or spin-resistant de-
signs. We can expect further refine-
ments of this type characteristic to be
available.
The non-spinning characteristics of
the future will probably be accomplished
as they were in the past, by the follow-
ing means: the wing proper will be de-
signed so that it stalls gradually with the
stall originating over the center portion
of the wing, and the ailerons used will
not stall the remainder of the wing when
benefit of the individual who might oc-
casionally become careless.
The individual who suddenly takes up
flying finds that it is most difficult to
coordinate the use of the rudder and
the ailerons. Most individuals after
sufficient practice master this operation,
but since this condition is somewhat
similar to the beginner learning scales
on the piano before he can play music,
it is rather boring. Considerable prog-
ress towards the answer to this problem
was made immediately prior to the war,
in a ship which had the controls inter-
connected so that the airplane automati-
cally made the correct turns. A modi-
fied form of this system is sure to ap-
pear on some of the postwar private air-
craft since the airplane is then much

they are deflected to obtain lateral con-
trol. Further longitudinal control will
be limited so that it will be impossible
to place an airplane in a complete stall
position without a dive and a violent
pull-up. Also, an automatic warning of
the impending stall, in the form of tail
buffeting, or perhaps an instrument on
the dash board, will be included for the

easier to fly, and for those whose physi-
cal reflexes are only average in speed, it
will be safer. As is natural, these char-
acteristics are not obtained without pay-
ing a penalty—in this case in the form
of loss of maneuverability. Although
this condition is considered serious by
the experienced pilot, the average indi-
vidual who takes a ride on Sunday aft-
ernoon with his family, is not interested
in violent aerobatics, and so will not
miss the loss of maneuverability.
Since we expect to have a consider-
ably larger number of airplanes in use
after the war than in the past, the visi-
bility of the average airplane will have
to be considerably improved, to prevent
serious accidents. Although a few cour-
ageous manufacturers have offered the
pusher type aircraft, and the aviation
industry has discussed this for years as
being inherently better than the con-
ventional tractor type, a satisfactory so-
lution of the problem from the perform-
ance and appearance standpoint has yet
to be found. Since it is only with the
pusher type installation that sufficient
visibility will be obtained, the solution
to this problem will be made in various
manners, and an aircraft of this general
form will be offered to the public.
Accessories, such as flaps, slots, and
spoilers, will be used where occasion de-
mands, and will be automatic in opera-
tion wherever possible to give the pilot
the safety advantage each one offers,
and yet will not burden him with a com-
plicity of levers to operate while in
flight.
The ratio of airplanes with respect
to the number of airports will increase
rapidly after the war, and hence
there will not be sufficient airports
available, so cow pastures and flight
strips will be pressed into use. Since
this type of airport will require cross-
wind take-offs and landings, tricycle
landing gears will become popular.
This type of landing gear not only is
dynamically stable, which the conven-
tional type is not, but also further in-
creases the visibility of the pilot. The
tricycle landing gear will make it possi-
ble for roadable type aircraft to become
available eventually for those persons
who are willing to sacrifice performance
and cost for this additional feature.
Weather and navigation are other haz-
ards which are much more serious with
aircraft than with surface vehicles, al-
though these will not be solved by the
airplane design proper. Navigation will
be considerably simplified, and the bad
effects of weather minimized, by the use
of accessories, such as better instru-
ments, radio, radar, and as yet un-
known new developments. Since it will
take equipment of this type to increase
the utility of the airplane so that the
private owner can justify purchasing an
aircraft, there will be a considerable
market, and we in the aviation industry
expect these units to become available

which the private owner can afford to
buy them.
Further, the immense experience
gained and equipment developed in
training an air force of more than two
million men, will be put to good use in
inexpensive and easy training of private
owners for instrument flight S3 that he
can use any of the new equipment.
cost
Although it is very easy to put down
list prices for postwar aircraft, as I have
already done, fulfillment of the goal set
is not in keeping with our prewar expe-
rience. This means that considerably
more effort will have to be spent in de-
veloping a satisfactory product at the
lowest possible cost, than has been done
in the past. When it is considered that
the prices we are aiming at are very lit-
tle higher than automobile prices, and
that aircraft dealers are entitled to as
good a profit margin as the automobile
dealers, these prices are going to be very
hard to meet with the small production
had by the aviation industry in compari-
son with the automobile industry. How-
ever, a careful study leads us to believe
that these prices are not out of line.
Approximately 55.2 percent of the
airplane manufacturer's cost is beyond
his control in the form of purchased
equipment and material, and since this
percentage is more than half the total
amount allowed the manufacturer, he
has two strikes against him at the start
•mless he can obtain the cooperation of
,iis suppliers. Our postwar aircraft will
be designed with the initial cost con-
trolled as rigidly as other factors have
been in the past. Further, aircraft
models will be carried over from year to
year, with minor changes, to amortize
the high development and tooling costs,
which will be necessary to start out with
a reasonable price.
Heretofore, the big disadvantage in
owning a private airplane has been the
upkeep. Although the actual operating
cost of an airplane is not great, any
one of the two-place ships previously
discussed will realize seventeen to eigh-
teen miles per gallon at cruising speed:
the indirect cost of fifteen dollars a
month hangar rent, ten percent of the
airplane list price per year for insur-
ance, and maintenance work which must
be done by licensed mechanics, consid-
erably swells the owner's "out-of-the
pocket" expenses once he has purchased
the airplane. We anticipate that these
indirect costs will be decreased consid-
erably in the postwar period since al-
ready there is considerable talk of han-
gars with five to eight dollar monthly
icntals, and when safer aircraft are built,
insurance rates will decrease. Also, the
large number of trained aircraft mechan-
ics who will return from the Army Air
Forces, and the increased number of
aircraft in operation, will lead to de-
creased maintenance costs. Further,
postwar aircraft will be built out of
more durable materials than the steel
tube and fabric in use at present on in-
expensive aircraft, as an all-metal con-
struction will not doubt be used by the
majority of the manufacturers.
However, it must be realized that ex-
cept in isolated cases the aircraft owned
by the private individual will be at least
a semi- if not a complete luxury.
performance
Spectacular increases in performance
from the prewar models will be had only
at a considerable additional cost. But
honest cruising speeds of 100 to 120
mph in the lower priced models will be
a reality, with perhaps 120 to 140 mph
cruising speeds for the higher priced
models. Landing and take-off speeds of
40 to 50 mph will be necessary to allow
the higher cruising speeds, unless con-
siderable additional cost in the form of
complicated high lift devices and addi-
tional power is satisfactory.
The performance of the airplane de-
pends a great deal on the weight of the
unit, since the heavier the aircraft the
more power is required to operate it—
and power is expensive. The airplane
manufacturer is beset, in attempting to
control weights, with approximately one-
third of the weight empty of the airplane
beyond his control in purchased items.
Also, the future's aircraft will have to be
more comfortable, smoother, and less
noisy, and this will cost additional
weight than has been used heretofore.
Therefore, in order to obtain a more
efficient aircraft, more engineering work
than has been done in the past will be
required in developing the most efficient
structures.
dependability
Although on the whole our prewar
designs have proved themselves capable
of taking a beating under grueling oper-
ating conditions, there have been main-
tenance troubles on certain petty items,
which are very disconcerting to the
owner. Since the complete aircraft is a
very complex structure, there is a pos-
sibility of an infinite number of things
going wrong, and a service test program
similar to the automobile industry's
proving ground will be instigated to
catch as many of these items as possible
before the aircraft is put into the pub-
lic's hands.
The basic structure of our prewar air-
craft has been satisfactory, as it is very
seldom that a structural failure has oc-
curred. The main troubles came from
the so-called accessory items. The ex-
perience gained by the war in develop-
ing such accessory items to withstand
the extreme conditions of wartime use,
will be of immeasurable benefit in elimi-
nating most of the difficulties in the
postwar period. As stated before, the
postwar aircraft will tend toward an all-
metal construction, which will further
decrease petty difficulties.
comfort
There is room for considerable im-
provement in the comfort of the prewar
aircraft. Thorough studies of exhaust
muffling, vibration, sound-proofing, air
conditioning, and seat construction will
be made, so that your postwar private
airplane will be as comfortable and as
pleasant to ride in as your automobile.
The main difficulty in obtaining com-
fort in an aircraft is in obtaining suf-
ficient room. Since the performance of
the airplane is a function of the size,
the designer is reluctant to make the
aircraft any larger than the bare mini-
mum, since if he does so he cannot
meet the performance of his competitors.
Although aircraft with sufficient room
have been built, the performance has
been so impaired that they have not
sold as well as their less comfortable but
faster competitors. A possible solution
to this is the use of more efficient, and
lighter, but higher powered engines, so
that the extra size aircraft can be
dragged through the air at a reasonable
speed and cost, but until such power-
plants are available performance will be
partially compromised for comfort.
The drawing shows a bit of the spare
time dreaming, in process in most air-
craft companies, of what the postwar
four-place design may be like. Aircraft
of this general type offer considerable
advantages over current designs, but
also have a large number of problems
which must be solved, and some inher-
ent disadvantages.
Due to the uncertainty of the fu-
ture I do not propose any particular de-
sign at this time, but I am sure that
supersafe, dependable, comfortable, and
inexpensive aircraft, with considerably
increased utility from our prewar mod-
els, will be used in considerable num-
bers by the average individual—for
pleasure, business, and sport.

HOUSING AND PLANNING
by
AN ANONYMOUS MEMBER OF THE FACULTY
The University of Michigan has furnished dormitories and
houses for students, but it leaves instructors "out in the cold."
Perhaps the housing of no group in
the low income bracket is so much in
need of attention as that of instructors
and teaching fellows in the universities.
Since salaries range from $1,000 to $3,-
000, the problem of securing adequate
living quarters becomes acute. So acute
was the situation in one of the university
towns that only a few years ago the
Board of Trustees of the university lo-
cated there passed a ruling that no mar-
ried man could be admitted to the in-
structional staff unless he had an inde-
pendent income. In most places, in fact,
salaries are so low that even single men
have difficulty in arranging for proper
living facilities. The situation at Michi-
gan is no different from that which ob-
tains elsewhere. Rents are extremely
high and there are insufficient good
apartment houses to accommodate even
a fraction of the men employed. The
consequence is that many have to live
in sub-standard quarters for which they
have to pay exorbitant prices.
Universities have generally given at-
tention to proper housing for students
and have in accordance erected dormi-
tories on an elaborate scale. Only one
university, however, seems to have taken
the plight of the instructor seriously
enough to erect dwellings for the group.
Some years ago partially as a work-
making project and partially because of
the realization that those in the lower in-
come levels on the teaching staff were
inadequately housed, Yale University-
erected residential cottages to rent
to instructors. What the results of the
venture have been the writer has been
unable to discover.
That such a project is feasible, how-
ever, is revealed by the experience of
the government in the erection of Co-
lonial Village in Arlington, Virginia and
Greenbelt in Maryland, both designed
for government workers with incomes
under $2,000. The former is an apart-
ment house project, the latter a general
housing project in which small apart-
ment dwellings are provided along with
school, recreational, and store facilities.
Gardens are also available for those
who have the time and inclination to
use them.
Colonial Village in Arlington is typical
of a number of apartment house projects
entered into by the government to house
low income groups and at the same time
to make work for unemployed laborers
and contractors. In 1939, three-room,
light, airy, and otherwise attractive
apartments were being rented for $45.00
per month. This was admittedly a low-
dividend investment project, but the fact
that it was taken over by one of th?
large life insurance companies on the
basis on which it was operated by the
government indicates that it was sound
from the financial point of view.
An interesting feature of Colonial Vil-
lage is that preference is given to couples
having families or to those who will
have families. The rule originally laid
down was that residents were not per-
mitted to continue occupancy unless
children were reared. This particular
feature is mentioned because in Ann Ar-
bor, as in practically all other univer-
sity cities, families with children are not
admitted to apartment houses, as they
are considered to be undesirable tenants.
The projects near Washington are lo-
cated outside the area of high rents and
high real estate values. Colonial Village
already mentioned is located far enough
from the capital city so that land values
are relatively low. It is, however, near
enough to a bus line so that transporta-
tion facilities are good. In spite of this
fact, most of the residents owned and
operated their own cars before the war.
A comparison might be made between
the situation in Arlington and that in
Ann Arbor. Here one available section
lies within a block and a half of the
present campus. In this section the
houses are old, the lots relatively large,
and land values fairly low. A sufficient
area could be obtained for a twenty-
five apartment dwelling for approxi-
mately $60,000. On the cost basis upon
which Colonial Village was constructed
under the Federal Housing Authority,
namely, $1,000 per room, three-room
apartments could be constructed at
$3,000 apiece or for a total overall cost
of $75,000. This amount, together with
the cost of the land, would run to some-
thing like $135,000. If the Housing
Authority could construct apartments
and put the rentals as low as $45.00 per
month, it certainly would seem that such
a project as the one indicated above
would be feasible for the University of
Michigan. So far as the writer knows,
no appropriate quarters are obtainable
here for so low a rent: hence the as-
sumption is made that no difficulty
would be experienced in renting the
apartments if they were available.
The other type of housing project is
exemplified by Greenbelt. It consists of
16
THE MICHICAN TECHNIC


ten to fifteen families. They are two
stories in height and are laid out in ac-
cordance with an artistic plan. The
rents were originally $35.00 per month.
As the project is not within walking dis-
tance of a street car or bus line, a spe-
cial bus service was established for the
community. The most attractive feature
lies in the fact that the village is not
near a congested area but instead is lo-
cated in the country where natural sur-
roundings are unusually attractive.
Since the present war started, this
project has been greatly enlarged by the
erection of individual dwellings which
have been sold to defense workers who
are employed in the plants near Wash-
ington. These dwellings are artistically
constructed and are modern in every
way. They are being sold to the occu-
pants at S35.00 a month, the entire in-
debtedness to be amortized, according
to report, in twenty years. The total
cost and the monthly payments are in
peculiar contrast to those that obtain in
the vicinity of Ann Arbor. In Greenbelt
the dwellings are being constructed un-
der contract and are being sold at
S3,500. In Ann Arbor houses of
much lower grade and in an area where
the natural surroundings are by no
means as attractive are being sold at $5,-
000 or more and on much higher
monthly payments. The higher cost
here, if it is legitimate because of higher
construction costs, might result in a
longer period of amortization, but that
such projects are feasible even though a
longer payment period were necessary,
there can be little doubt.
Some of the possible features of such
a project can be seen by reference to
the plan of one apartment house of a
proposed group of ten, as designed by a
student in the College of Architecture.
Each building as planned was to house
eighteen instructor families. It provided
for a roof garden to be used as a play-
ground for children, and a well-lighted
basement with game rooms and a swim-
ming pool. Provision was also made for
a nursery school. The recreational and
other facilities could be provided with-
out a prohibitive addition to cost. Un-
der the projected arrangement, trans-
portation was to be provided by a bus
cooperatively owned and to be operated
by a student or the caretaker.
With reference again to location, if a
project comparable to Greenbelt were
to be entered upon here, there is suffi-
cient land lying in close proximity to
the University so that adequate acreage
could be secured at reasonably low cost.
In fact the University already owns land
that probably could be utilized for the
purpose in question.
If the University authorities are re-
luctant to enter upon a project designed
to furnish adequate housing facilities
for the staff or instructors, a cooperative
project could undoubtedly be carried
out with satisfactory results. As a mat-
ter of fact a cooperative project was only
recently entered into by several of the
instructors. The war probably inter-
fered with the development of the plans
of the group, but after the war they
will undoubtedly be resumed. If a co-
operative enterprise should be decided
upon, a corporation could be formed in
which instructors and others could buy
stock, or the financing could be handled
through a bond issue. One apartment
house in Ann Arbor was so financed. It
remains for someone with sufficient in-
terest in the instructors of the Univer-
sity to start a project to house ade-
quately at least a part of the group.
Thus the ever present worry of provid-
ing themselves with adequate living
quarters could be taken off the minds of
an important part of the teaching stall

An interesting addition which has
been brought to the Michigan campus
by the war is the Aircraft Inspector's
School. The Technic, in the interest
of its readers, (to say nothing of the
women enrolled in the course) has un-
dertaken to portray a typical day in the
life of several of these girls.
The four girls who were interviewed
well represent the variety within the
group. Angie Bozzer, who is 20, went
to Cooley High School in Detroit and
graduated in June, 1943. She was born
in Pennsylvania but went to Italy at the
age of three and lived there in a town
near Trieste until 1937, when she re-
turned to the United States. While in
Italy, she went to school with her Italian
playmates and lived the life of a typical
Italian girl. She spoke Italian constant-
ly, even at home, so when she arrived
in America in 1937 she had to learn
English as an American would have to
learn French or Italian. When she grad-
uates she is going to work at the Ford
Motor Company's Rouge plant in Dear-
born.
Angie and her school chum, Barbara
Graham, decided to become Aircraft In-
spectors together. Barbara, 19, knew
many engineers who attended the Uni-
versity because she lived in Howell,
which is only twenty odd miles from
Ann Arbor. She wants to send each of
them a copy of the March Technic
to prove that she is actually here on
the campus in the College of Engineer-
ing-
Photos by John DeBoer
The third girl of the foursome is Kaye
Mitton, 25. Her husband, a marine, is
on duty in the South Pacific. During
her rather colorful past she sang for
three years with Jimmy Ladden and his
orchestras and she was an automatic
hostess in Allentown, Pa. (An auto-
matic hostess, by the way, is one of
these girls who sings you a song if you
put a nickel in the slot and make a re-
quest). She is going to inspect parts at
the Chevrolet plant in Flint.
Marie Cupples is twenty and she has
been married for almost a year. "Mar-
riage," she says with a sigh, "is wonder-
ful." Her husband is flying with the
Army Air Force in Australia. When her
husband sailed from California, she
came back East to Detroit. Since she
needed a job, she worked as a bank
teller, stenographer, and now has wound
up as an Aircraft Inspector at the Uni-
versity of Michigan.
When the girls finish their course,
they will have completed ten weeks of
a very heavy schedule. In addition to
morning and afternoon classes, they
sometimes attend in the evenings. Their
week-ends, however, are their own. (To
enjoy Ann Arbor's great and varied
social life, no doubt!)
The prospective students apply for
their jobs in Detroit. If they are chosen,
they are sent here for their ten week's
course, during which they are paid a
certain daily salary.
The Technic wishes success to these
girls who are really doing their bit for
the war effort.

As long as there have been wars,
there have been men like Mr. Houser
who devote endless hours to doing re-
search work which will help bring the
war to a speedier climax. At present he
is doing work for Dr. Kuethe and Col-
umbia University. This work is ex-
tremely confidential, and details regard-
ing it cannot be revealed until after the
war.
Mr. Houser, one of the most recent
additions to the teaching staff of the
Engineering College, has been referred
to by students who are familiar with
him as one of the most futuristic mem-
bers of the Aeronautical Department.
Houser's interest in aeroplanes, a deep
reaching one, was fostered when Lind-
berg made his first flight across the At-
lantic Ocean. Houser, like many an-
other young enthusiast, became extreme-
ly interested and began building model
planes. We are truly lucky that this
early interest in planes never died, for

jacque Houser

this hobby grew into the foundation for
his life work. Now, besides doing re-
search work, teaching Aero 1, 4, and 6.
and teaching a class in aircraft inspec-
tion, he has just obtained his Master's
degree. By the way, Mr. Houser thinks
that the juniors and seniors at Michi-
gan have a better background, more
initiative, and are better thinkers than
any others he has come in contact with.
It might also be mentioned that Mr.
Houser is a true Southerner, having
lived in Alabama until a year ago when
he came to Michigan: and as a South-
erner, he is not too fond of Michigan
weather. Mr. Houser is a graduate of
the Alabama Polytechnical Institute.
While attending college he worked as
a lab assistant and later as a graduate
assistant. He was the president of his
fraternity, Pi Kappa Tau, for two years,
and he managed to make Tau Beta Pi
also.
Aside from all the work he is doing
during the day, Mr. Houser finds time
to make use of his pilot's license and
read as well as tend a large victory gar-
den. As a lover of food, he is fortunate

George Sloan is one of our many
"Michigan men in khaki.'' He em-
barked on his military career when he
joined the ROTC his freshman year on
campus. In March 1943, he was in-
ducted at Fort Custer, along with the
rest of the advanced ROTC. After a
month's return to the University he
was sent to Aberdeen, Maryland, in or-
der to receive his basic training. This
he described as "beating the rooster up
each morning."
After this "uneventful but interesting
period," he once again returned to U. of
M. to finish his Chemical Engineering
course. He felt very strange and out of
place in most of his classes, as the ma-
jority of them were regular Engine
school courses. However, he has been
shipped to OCS since the time of this
interview, and in four months he will
graduate as a 2nd lieutenant.

George Sloan
While at Michigan, George was one
of the traditionally active members of
Sigma Phi Epsilon. His name is also
included on the rosters of Phi Eta Sig-
ma, Tau Beta Pi, Vulcans, Phi Kappa
Phi, and Scabbard and Blade. He had
a long career on the Tcchnic staff—six
semesters, to be exact, and for a time
he held the position of Assistant Editor.
George was married last May to a
Michigan girl whom he met during his
freshman year here.
He expects to work in ordnance in the
future, but says it's all up to the gov-
ernment. Our only comment is, "What
isn't up to the government nowadays?"
Although he has no time to indulge
in them now, his hobbies include photo-
graphy, golf, tennis, and music. His
interest in photography, however, does
not lie along the lines of most snap-
shooting shutterbugs. He and his father
have delved rather deeply into the ab-
struse realms of emulsions, tonal rendi-
tions, and film speed. (We don't know
what this is all about either. Don't get
him into a conversation on photography,
or this is what you probably hear.)
After the war, we hope to see George
back at school, as he lacks only one
semester's work toward his degree. Until
then, he will be carried along by the
fortunes of war.

IN 1940 the Signal Corps brought one of its toughest
radio assignments to Bell Telephone Laboratories
and Western Electric.
A rugged multi-frequency set was wanted for the
armored forces. It must be, in effect, a radio switchboard
to interconnect tanks, scout cars, command cars, artil-
lery units, anti-tank vehicles.
The model was ready in one quarter of the time
normally required to design and build such a complex
set—an FM transmitter and receiver having 80 crystal
controlled frequencies. Any 10 crystals could be quickly
plugged in—and push buttons provided instant switch-
ing from one channel to another. The set was tested—
accepted—ordered in quantity.
Meanwhile Western Electric engineers were tackling
knotty production problems—tooling up of plant, train-
ing girls for the exacting work, procuring raw materials,
setting up complex testing procedures.
Among the toughest problems were those of crystal
manufacture. Millions of these tiny quartz wafers would
be needed — each lapped to dimensions, silver plated in a
vacuum, and mounted on wires so small that they must
be soldered in place under a microscope. Amazing new
machines and methods were devised — and the crystals
came out on time.
Radio, electrical, mechanical and industrial engineers
at Western Electric — Bell Laboratories men and Signal
Corps men — all contributed invaluable aid. Early pro-
duction goals were met — volume increased steadily.
Today huge numbers of units have been delivered.
They are providing the instant communications that
enable our armored forces to travel farther and faster
and to hit harder!

REFLECTS
ANOTHER semester has come to
A.\nn Arbor, and with it, another
group of innocent freshman boys and

girls. In recalling our own freshman
days, it seems to us that weeks elapsed
after our arrival in AA before we really
began to know our way around the
campus and town. In order that you,
the incoming freshmen, may more
quickly establish yourselves in our
little village, the Technic is printing:
What to See, What to Do, What to
Get, What Not to See, What Not to
Do, and What Not to Get in Ann Arbor.
First of all, we wish to inform the
Michiganovice that for his convenience
the University has posted Deans in vari-
ous strategic spots throughout the cam-
pus. If you get into trouble, see a Dean.
He will be only too happy to help you.
(Of course what he will be only too
happy to help you do shouldn't happen
to a dog). So make your slogan: "Rip
your jean? Konked on bean? Don't
make a scene—See a Dean!"
*£**

There are many things to see, do, and
get in Ann Arbor. However, there are
also many things not to see, do, and get
in Ann Arbor. Foremost in the category
of things not to see is AngeU Hall, a
medieval dungeon in which mid-Vic-
torian psych profs creep around looking
for neuroses. (Alright—so psych ain't
24
learned in Angell Hall and I do mix my
metaphors—I'm an engineer). Try also
to avoid places and courses which entail
work—this is a bad start, and you will
simply go all to hell.
Leaving this den of corruption and
crossing to the engineering side of cam-
pus, we find a magnificent structure
known as East Hall. It is said that East
Hall was once the home of a very prom-
inent Ann Arbor family which we shall
call the family of R , or X .
The R 's, or N 's, were a very
happy family until one day Mr. R ,
or N . suspected his wife, the beau-
tiful Madame R , or N , of hav-
ing an affaire de coeur with a peripat-
etic circus clown who was living in
Ypsilanti (Mich.) at the time.
Mr. R , or X , was very tol-
erant until Mrs. R , or N , bore
triplets, all with putty noses. He then.
in a fit of pique, poisoned Mrs. R
or N . hanged the clown (known as
Ypso Facto), drowned the triplets (they
had not yet been named, but they were
affectionately called Putty Nose I, Putty
Nose II, and Putty Nose III by their
late beloved mother), and finally, after
deeding the property to the Ann Arbor
Board of Education, shot himself.
The AA B. of Ed., not knowing what
to do with the property, turned it into
a grammar school. The house was ag-
ing, however, and when it was declared
unsafe by the Ann Arbor fire depart-
ment, the AA B. of Ed. turned it over
to the University, who, not having any-
thing better to do with is. turned it over
to the Engineering School.
It is now an integral part of this
school, and has found a place in the
hearts of students and faculty alike, who
affectionately call it East Hell. How-
ever, when an obscure Engineering Eng-
lish professor found a fire in the
basement several years ago, and called
the fire department, the other profes-
sors, in a fit of pique, did not speak to
him for ninety-three weeks.
Of primary importance, also, in the
list of things to see, do, and get in Ann owr.
Arbor is the East Liberty Street Stud:
Hall and Reading Room. Some people.
even the head librarian already, call thi-
charming place the Pretzel Bell Tavern.
You will find that the best students of
all meet in Pretzel Bell Hall (plug—set
'em up next time, Clint!)
Just around the corner from the
E.L.S.S.H.R.R. is a delightful place
to dance known as Platonic Temple.
Interrelated with this "thing to see" if
"things to get." Most people in Ann
Arbor like to get anything they can.
and brother, Platonic Temple is the
place to get it. The third "thing", name-
ly, "things to do," is up to you, dear
freshman—don't let your school down.

Little Johnny had torn his trousers
twice in the course of one morning, and
when he came in again with his pants
torn, his mother said, "You go right up-

them yourself."
Some time later she wondered about
him and went upstairs to see how he
was getting on. The torn pants were
lying on a chair, but there was no sign
of Johnny. Returning downstairs, she
heard a noise in the cellar and decided
he was down there playing.
"Are you down there running around
without your trousers on?" she called
loudly.
"No, Madame, I'm just reading the

It's wonderful how science can over-

explaining one of his ideas:

he said. "Why, by properly adjusting
my carburetor I can save S0% of my
fuel. Then by avoiding fast starts I
save iO'/r more, and I save another
iQ7r by always driving at the proper
cruising speed for the car."
After doing a little counting on his
fingers, a mechanic exclaimed. "But thai

oacriiicial Corrosion
&lt;lo you know
it means?
The zinc coating on galvanized sheets or
other products protects the iron or steel
underneath in two ways: 1, by simple cover-
acre, with a sheath of rust-resistant metal; 2,
by electrochemical action or "sacrificial cor-
rosion". The first is clearly understandable,
but the second is more complex.
When two metals are put into an acid solu-
tion or electrolyte, each will tend to oxidize
and to cause an electric current to flow
toward the other. The metal more chemically
active will oxidize more rapidly and produce
the stronger current, and will keep the other
metal from oxidizing. This is known as "sacri-
ficial corrosion".
Remember the old "door-bell battery",
•with the zinc and copper elements? How the
zinc gradually oxidized, or corroded away,
while the copper was practically unaffected?
Here the zinc saved the copper by sacrificial
corrosion.
Through an electrochemical action similar
to this the zinc on galvanized sheets gives the
second kind of protection to the iron or steel

jungle stream crossings
Just as in ancient history when
Caeser's engineers had to bridge the
Rhine to pursue and defeat the enemies
of Rome, so today our military engi-
neers must span the many streams and
rivers of the Southwest Pacific area in
recapturing lands conquered by the in-
vading Japanese armies.
Men and materials must be trans-
ported across tropical water barriers in
a matter of hours to keep pace with
modern lightning warfare. There is no
time to run tensile strength tests on
vines or bamboo saplings to determine
their usefulness for construction work.
The engineer must know the materials
available in the region in which he
is working and know which are most
suitable for his purpose.
As part of its training program, a
unit of United States Army engineers in
Australia began instruction on this
phase of jungle warfare. Twelve types
of bridges which had proven successful
under battle conditions were selected for
the training program. Each platoon of
the unit was assigned one bridge as its
project.
The ladder type suspension bridge,
illustrating the overhead design, was
made of saplings bound together with
wire to form a horizontal ladder. This
was supported by two half-inch steel
cables which also acted as hand rails.
The suspension bridge illustrated was
140 feet in length and would support
men at 10-foot intervals.
Others of the overhead type built by
the training crew included the spider
bridge and the "Flying Fox."
The spider bridge consisted of a sin-
gle row of four-inch butts supported by
wire and saplings. It was 140 feet in
length and capable of crossing men at
30-foot intervals.
The ''Flying Fox" was of simple de-
sign, being only a chair and pulley at-
tached to a 150-foot sloping cable.
Gravity pulled the loaded chair across
the stream and an attached rope brought
the empty chair back. This device
would transport an army at the rate of
one man per minute.

into a science.
His job is one of the earliest in
a long series of operations which
bring a melt of Allegheny Ludlum
stainless, electrical or other alloy
steel to its final form, rigidly true
to specifications. His experience
determines whether the molten
mass within the furnace is progress-

any adjustments necessary to pro-
duce the quality of steel specified.
His judgment is double checked, of
course, by thousands of dollars
worth of amazingly accurate test-
ing equipment, built for analyzing
with hairline precision.
For, in wartime especially, the
properties of alloy steels must be
maintained with the utmost con-
sistency. Lives of men—even the
outcome of battles depends upon
this uniformity, because the place
of alloy steels is always in the vital
heart of a war mechanism.
Lives and battles depend upon
other things in this war, too—mat-

food, fuel, gasoline, rubber, waste
fats and scrap metal—all these have
to do with how soon the war will
be won, and at what price. They

bridge would pass men at six-foot in-

Another footbridge of the floating
type was built of bamboo and barbwire,
but was supported by bundles of bam-
boo poles wired together, instead of the
metal drums. A hand rail was added
for safety.
In all of these experiments on bridge
building and in the training of engineers
for this work, self-reliance and initiative
of the individual soldier is stressed. No
two situations are ever alike, and the
ability to fit general knowledge to a par-
ticular instance is one of the most im-
portant requirements of the engineer in

Anticipating the requirements of Al-

engineers are putting ten 5,000-kiIowatt
steam generating plants on wheels. By
supplying power for rapidly advancing
front line bases, these power units may
become vitally essential to a quick vic-
tory, once the second front is fully
■ opened.
Within 48 hours after arrival, these
rail-mounted generators can be deliver-
ing full load current for war production,
military needs, or civilian use, replacing
bombed or sabotaged power houses.
The new unit will operate on coal of
unusually low quality and under ex-
treme ranges of temperature.
As shown in the illustration, the first
two cars of the train carry sixteen air-
cooled condensers with motor driven
fans. These coolers will condense the
full amount of steam with air as hot as
95 F, saving more than 97 per cent of
th? boiler water for re-use.
The third car carries the turbo-gen-

"THIS man is a glass chemist. And the
* sand he's working with is going to get
into Adolf Hitler's eyes and hurt.
Here's how. Glass,basically is made from
sand. And glass in this war, in the skilled
hands of American glass makers,is a potent
weapon. It replaces metals on many jobs,
metals needed for killing Huns and Japs.
In bombsights and fire control instru-
ments glass helps to rain accurate death on
theenemy.In heavy industries,such as the
explosive industry, its characteristic resist-
ance to corrosion speeds powder output.
Glass in medical and laboratory fields puts
us and our allies ahead in hospital treat-
ment and in vital laboratory developments.
The U.S. is lucky in having a well estab-
lished glass industry and not having to lean
uponanypartof the outside world forthis
essential material. Glass was ready for war,
and was able to contribute to the speed rec-
ords set by other industries such as gaso-
line and synthetic rubber.
It took a lot of research to make Amer-
ican glass the best in the world. At Corning
way back in peacetime, more than 200
laboratory men were working steadily on
new forms of glass and new uses for this
amazing material. More than 25,000 for-
mulae for glass were developed. Today
around 250 different types of glass are in
production under the "E" pennant at
Coming's main plant.
There are glasses for example that
withstand corrosive chemicals, that
cannot be harmed by heat, that have
high electrical insulating qualities, that
are extremely resistant to mechanical
breakage. And these are only a few of the
reasons that engineers, too, consider glass
the material with endless possibilities for
the future. Corning Glass Works,

The development of the helicopter is
now in the second important stage. It is
no longer the fragile, experimental toy
that "posed" for the newsreel cameras.
The ugly and amateurish-looking body
has been smoothed out into a sleek, ap-
pealing structure which one would be
proud to have in his garage. In fact, the
design has been improved to the extent
that it is now ready for mass-produc-
tion.
It was recently announced that Nash-
Kelvinator would turn out helicopters
for the U. S. Army Air Forces, but it
will take quite some time to get the as-
sembly lines rolling. The picture shows
one of the first steps required in the
process of producing aircraft on a large
scale. This wooden mock-up of the Si-
korsky helicopter will be used to design
the dies and fixtures necessary for the
forming and assembly operations on the
main fuselage sections. From this full-
size model, engineers can plan the lay-
out of the assembly-lines, the spacing of
the jigs, and the types of conveyors
which will be needed to carry the sub-
assemblies to the final production line.
We know that the use of these air-
craft during the war will hasten their de-
velopment to the extent that they should
be commercially practical by the end
of the conflict. It is easy to visualize
the post-war uses of the helicopter.
In time, it should become a common-
place carrier of mail in inter-urban
and rural work; and later on, perhaps,
we may use it in place of the automobile
on errands and social calls, but this pe-
riod is still far off.
It is harder, however, to predict to
what use these planes will be put during
the present war. Let us consider the
helicopter's particular defects and mer-
its. Combat work is largely prohibited
by its vulnerable construction and slow
speed. If it were faced by enemy fire,
there would be little hope for its sur-

vival, for the frail rotor blades would
not take the punishment that can be ab-
sorbed by modern combat planes. How-
ever, although its low speed would be
a hazard under these conditions, it is
an advantage if properly used.
The helicopter would excel in com-
munications, ambulance and patrol duty,
or at any other job which makes use
of its ability to maneuver and land
slowly and precisely. The fact that it
can land almost at a dead stop permits
it to operate on water or land with
equal facility and without difficult ad-
justments of the landing gear, for small
pontoons w^ill serve on either medium.
Notions that helicopters could com-
plement parachute troops in surpri^
landing operations are inconsistent, be-
cause they require these valuable de-
vices to work under conditions which
emphasize their defects and vulnerabil-
ity. There are still many important
uses for these craft however, in which
they will succeed admirably and effi-
ciently.

The TECHNICAL knowledge, the ingenuity and the resources
of America are at the disposal of our skilled medical officers on
the fighting fronts of the world. They command every aid the
nation can supply. That is one reason why a wounded man's
chances of survival are greater today than they have been in
am other war.
Among the materials that are helping medical men in their
fight to save lives are the stainless steels. Used in operating
tables, surgical instruments and in other medical equipment,
stainless steels are serving in hospitals in this country and
overseas.
Frequent sterilization with high temperature steam or strong
disinfectants will not injure stainless steels. Their smooth, hard
surface is easily kept free from germs that can cause fatal infec-
tion. Even in the damp tropics, stainless steels do not rust.
Tough and durable, free from the possibility of chipping,
stainless steels can withstand the rigors of wartime use.
On the home front, too, stainless steels are making their
contribution to the health of the nation. Because they are easier
to dean and keep clean than other metals, they are widely
used in equipment necessary to the processing, preparing and
serving of lot ids. They keep their bright finish, impart no Havor
to food, and resist food chemicals. They will be used increas-
ingly in restaurants, in the home, and in many industries where
their unique properties are so desirable.
.Stainless steels are "stainless" because they contain more
than 12 per cent chromium. Low-carbon ferrochromium, a re-

. . a standard of living which is higher than in any other country."
Almost as important advances have
been made in lubricating oils. Through
combination of some of the hydrocar-
bons resulting from the cracking proc-
ess, we get valuable plastics, and from
others we get the materials from which
synthetic rubber is made. These devel-
opments in the field of organic chemistry
present a striking illustration of the way
an advance in one part of a field supplies
information directly usable by another
group, and also are a tribute to the ad-
vantages which result when groups,
which are normally competitive, pool all
their resources to a common end.
When this war is over, we will mourn
for many of our citizens who gave their
lives, and we must comfort and aid
many others who have been wounded or
injured so badly that they cannot im-
mediately resume a normal life. We will
have dissipated some of our important
natural resources. Scientists tell us that
our supplies of petroleum are showing
variety of new materials which will cre-
ate a minor revolution in textiles and
protective coatings, and to some extent
in housing.
There will be a difficult period of re-
adjustment during the first few post-war
years, but within five years, our country
should, unless some new external force
changes our mode of life, enter a period
of prosperity which will give us a stand-
ard of living never before reached in
this or any other country.
This is a broad statement and I should
perhaps pause here to review the reasons
which, in my judgement, warrant that
prediction. They may be summarized
in two brief statements.
1. The advance of science and of en-
gineering has been proceeding at an ac-
celerated pace and will continue to ad-
vance even more rapidly in the imme-
diate future.
2. Our country will emerge from this
war with its resources only slightly im-
paired, with enlarged manufacturing ca-
pacity, and with a people disciplined
and aroused by the crisis through which
they have passed.
The intelligent and industrious appli-
cation of scientific knowledge to the util-
ization of our still abundant resources
should give to each one of us a more
abundant life, better health, and leisure
to enjoy the better things which will be
spread before us
You will recall that this vision of a
happy future is based on the assumption
that no new force intervenes to prevent
us from using our natural resources and
our scientific knowledge to our best ad-
vantage. What possible new force might
come into our lives?
We have glanced back over the devel-
opment of science during the past 5000
years and seen that its effect on human
life has been slow until the past century,
and that rapid progress has only come in
the past 50 years, with an increasing
tempo which at the present time niake-
us almost breathless.
I invite you now to go back to the
goal posts of the remote past and trace
the progress in another field—that of in-
ternational relations. Five thousand
years ago when the Egyptians had a dis-
pute with a neighboring nation, they
fought with bows and arrows, spears
and chariots. Today when two nations
have a serious disagreement, they fight
with machine guns, tanks, submarines,
and airplanes. The weapons have been
improved, but the procedures remain
the same. Why is it that in the field of
science there has been such wonderful
progress, with so little in the field of
international relations?
Our country has achieved a standard
of living which is higher than in any
other country in the world's history.
Our prosperity is due in part to our high
educational level, partly to the freedom
of initiative permitted us under our
democratic government, and in large
measure, to the quality of our natural
resources.
We are enabled to take full advantage
of our opportunities because of the large
amount of power available to us. In the
days of ancient Rome, in France before
the French Revolution, as in Japan to-
day, the wealthy and the ruling classes
lived in relative luxury while the great
majority of the people were actual slaves
or at least eked out a miserable exist-
ance in a bondage not much better than
slavery. Each man, woman, and child
in our country has the equivalent of SO

slaves ready to serve us night and day.
Ours is the first civilization of the world
which gives each of us the equivalent of
many servants without a single individ-
ual being a slave.
President Roosevelt's four freedoms
have been widely accepted as a charter
for a peaceful world. Two of these are
freedoms '"from." Freedom of religion
and freedom of discussion may be en-
acted by statutes, and if the statutes are
enforced these freedoms will be secure.
The engineer, as every other citizen,
should join in upholding these two free-
doms, but he has no unusual responsi-
bility because of his professional train-
ing.
The other two freedoms—freedom
from want and fear—cannot be attained
by statute or decree. They come only
after each individual has attained a
measure of ecenomic independence, and
has confidence that his relations with
society will be controlled justly and with
judgment.
So long as the coolie in China must
saw boards from logs with a handsaw
and must carry burdens on his head,
China can never be free from want. If
China could be given the advantages of
our engineering and scientific develop-
ment, and could be assured of just treat-
ment from the other nations of the
world, there would be an unbelievable
improvement in conditions there in a
single generation. And China is only an
illustration of the improvement which
would come to the underprivileged in-
habitants of many countries.
The engineer leads in the crusade to
free the world from want because of his
technological knowledge. It is his method
of thinking which must prevail if the
world is to be freed from fear. The en-
gineer studies his problem carefully in
the light of all attainable information,
considers the possible alternative solu-
tions, and on the basis of his reasoning,
he decides which solution is the best un-
der the circumstances. There can be no
freedom from fear so long as any ruler
makes decisions on the basis of his in-
tuition, or any other emotional factor.
Freedom from fear can come to the
world only when the engineer's method
of reasoning and forming judgements
is extended to the social as it now is to
the physical world.
So now what can we say of the future
of engineering? Certainly in its techno-
logical features it will continue to be
respected, as at present, for the direct

In addition to cleaning steel, the oxy-

contributions which it brings to our
standards of living. The engineer of
the future must be able to interpret and
make available to the world the ever
growing flood of new scientific discov-
eries. It is his task to make freedom
from want a possibility.
The engineer will, however, have
failed to meet his responsibilities com-
pletely unless he also applies his trained
faculties to the problems of human re-
lations. Freedom from fear can come
only when all governmental agencies
are directed by men who have the en-
gineer's objective viewpoint, and his
habit of studying all factors before de-
ciding which of several alternative plans
will solve a particular problem most sat-
isfactorily.
For it must be emphasized that con-
stitutions and statutes can only provide
a general plan, which must be adminis-
tered fairly by competent executives.
Our future governments should be ad-
ministered, not by politicians with their
thoughts on votes, nor by legalists with
past desisions as their guide, nor by
emotional leaders with their heads in
the clouds, but by men who have the en-
gineer's method of reasoning and form-
ing judgements.
The future of engineering is secure
in its technological aspects. The future
of engineering as a social force depends
on the attitude which young men like
you take toward their responsibilities to
the world. If you restrict yourselves to
the narrow technical framework of your
profession, you will, it is true, be con-
tributing to the world's welfare. But if,
as you progress in your profession, you
also take an intelligent interest and seek
an active part in the affairs of your
school district, your country, and in
world affairs, you will be using your
training in that field where development
has been most retarded—the field of
social relations.
Today we speak with pride of the con-
tribution of engineering to the material
things of life—airplanes, radio, plastics,
synthetic rubber. It would be a wonder-
ful thing if the speaker who one hun-
dred years from now reviews the prog-
ress of engineering in the century which
is now commencing could cite, as the
greatest achievement of the engineer,
that he had relieved the world not only
of freedom from want, but also of free-
dom from fear. May each of you make
some contribution to this ideal.

Before John Murdock convinced skeptical
Londoners of 1815 that his new discovery, coal gas,
■was a fuel and not a conjurer's trick, he had to find
pipe that would convey the gas safely. Pipe of avail-
able materials such as lead, wood and clay either
leaked, broke or fouled chemically. Finally, John
tried a gun barrel. It worked! If one gun barrel
was good, a mile of them would be perfect! So
reasoned Murdock, as he spliced and, by heat and
hammer, welded all the gun barrels he could buy,
borrow or beg, into the world's first steel pipeline.
Those gun barrels were the beginning of the pres-
ent network of little and big inch steel pipelines
and safety cylinders and carriers which transport
liquid and gas fuel everywhere.
For nearly a century, The Harrisburg Steel
Corporation has been known among oil and gas

Information supplied by an Industrial Publication
Not only the quality of steel castings, but their
practicability and production cost under ordinary
foundry conditions are influenced by design. The
following suggestions are offered as an aid to
proper design.
1. Whenever possible, all sections should be de-
signed for uniform thickness.
2. Structural design involving abrupt changes in
section should be avoided.
3. Sharp comers at adjoining sections should be
eliminated whenever possible.
4. When the structure becomes very complicated,

it is better to break it into several components
that can be cast separately and assembled by
welding or bolting.
5. In designing unfed sections in "L" or "V"
shapes, it is suggested that all sharp comers at
the junction be replaced by radii so that this section
becomes slightly smaller than that of the arms.
6. In designing sections that join to make an "X",
it is suggested that two of the arms be offset
considerably.
7. In the case of unfed "T" and "X" sections, the
radii at the junctions should be relatively small.

If you want to repair, resurface or
water-proof a floor or roof area, it can
now be done overnight. A new concrete-

it has greater compressive strength. Be-
cause it is more resilient than concrete,
it is less tiring on the feet, and will not
chip or crack under hard traffic.

The widespread recognition of the
electron microscope has instigated the
General Electric Company to develop
a portable model. The device is built
in two parts, a 78 pound microscope
proper (shown above) and a 55 pound

volt a-c power and is ten times more
powerful than the best light micro-
scope. Of course its strength falls far
short of that of the larger stationary

The promise of plastics, in the after-war
years, holds so much for manufacturers and
consumers alike that perhaps we should learn
a little more about the nature of these new
materials.
Of prime significance, chemically made plas-
tics are unlike any structural material we
have had to work with in the past.
Plastics are the product of chemistry. They
are one of the outstanding examples of the
chemist's ability to produce—out of coal,
petroleum, air, salt, and other basic elements
—totally new substances.
Important to an understanding of plastics is
that they differ widely in their property
characteristics.
For example, some plastics are extremely
tough and withstand rough usage. This is
true of Ethocel—one of the Dow plastics.
Other types are pliable. Some have almost
optical qualities in their clarity. Others pos-
sess excellent electrical insulating value. Some
withstand heat and others extreme cold.
Among Dow plastics possessing some of
these properties to a high degree is Styron—
a plastic especially valuable as an electrical
insulator and having many other uses where
lustrous beauty or resistance to acids and
alkalis are factors of importance. Saran, on
the other hand, is notable for its tensile
strength and flexibility, which make it widely
used for such products as tubing, woven
fabrics and rope. Ethocel, in a special formula,
is especially strong and tough at extremely
low temperatures.

What will your new car look like? A rolling solarium? A cross between a beetle and a show-
case? No! You'll stick to present designs and like it.
IN DIRECT contrast with the justly
emphatic of our "All out till Vic-
tory" war effort, we are being re-
minded daily of the vital necessity for
constructive postwar planning.
In spite of the magnitude of world-
wide problems demanding world-wide
policies as their only effective solution,
the average American, being basically
human, is naturally most concerned
about his own personal postwar situa-
tion. Many wierd pictures have been
painted for his benefit but the elements
are so contradictory that he is left ut-
terly confused and bewildered.
Due to the restrictions of military
censorship the public has only been par-
tially informed regarding the nature and
advantage of new products. In some
rare instances the announcements are
being made by the manufacturers them-
selves; and it is to be noted that their
statements are remarkably sober and
practical, for they have, no doubt, been
carefully weighed and analyzed before
release.
In keeping with the designer's activi-
ties in the automotive industry during
the pre-war days, it is indeed significant
that the great majority of these pro-
posed postwar miracles will be appli-
cable to the transportation industry.
Indeed, more has been written about
the postwar automobile than about all
the other types of products and appli-
ances together.
It is a known fact that it is quite easy
to design and build a car which will at-
tract so much attention that it will
stop traffic on the street and will capi-
talize the attention of the entire Auto-
mobile Show. But it is also known that
the average American, while being very
much interested in discussing a new
sensation, will back away from it and
will purchase for his own use a more
conservative car, thus leaving the risks
of the so-called first year experimental
period to his neighbors, with the inevi-
table result that very few such cars are
ever sold at any price.
The American public will not pay ex-
cessive premiums for intangible features
and questionable improvements. Neither
will be willing to sacrifice practicability,
safety, and fundamental habits and
standards for the sake of fulfilling the
predictions of untimely prophets.
We have chosen as the subject of this
paper a sober discussion of the Practi-
cal Postwar Car, in direct contrast with
current fantastic predictions. We will
not try to tell you any more about what
the postwar automobile will be like, but
will instead confine our remarks to what
type of car cannot, in our opinion, be
made acceptable to the motorist nor can
be economically produced by the manu-
facturer.
We will confine our survey to those
basic materials entering into body con-
struction, which have figured most
prominently in postwar predictions.
LET us first consider the aluminum
body. As a basic material we find
that the cost of any suitable aluminum
alloy is much higher than body steel.
Present sheet prices call for an average
of 30c per pound for aluminum, against
3^ per pound for steel, or about 10 to 1.
Considering an approximate saving in
weight of one pound for each pound of
aluminum used, when comparing parts
of equal strength, we still have an un-
favorable cost ratio of 5 to 1 for a
given fabricated assembly. Undoubt-
edly, the price of aluminum will be
lower after the war due to tremendous
expansion of manufacturing facilities,
but it must also be remembered that
production of steel has also increased
considerably and that no matter what
happens, steel as a raw material will al-
ways be far cheaper than aluminum.
Even if we adopt secondary aluminum
for the majority of our body parts and
are able to realize thus a total reduc-
tion of SQ% in the present cost of alumi-
num, and if we discount the possibility
of any reduction in the price of steel,
the final cost ratio for a given assembly
would still be 21,/&gt; to 1 in favor of steel.
Aluminum alloys cannot be formed
and drawn to the same degree as steel
and their adoption would require a ma-
jor revision in design of the bodies as at
present developed for steel construction.
Parts would have to be simplified by
the elimination of sharp corners and of
integral complex flanges. This would
necessarily reinstate a great number of
minor individual parts such as small
brackets and reinforcements which had
been gradually eliminated by combina-
tion on steel bodies, but which would
now resuscitate former sub-assembly
problems and labor costs.
The modern steel body is assembled
almost entirely by spot welding. The
application of this highly efficient pro-
cedure to aluminum brings in a lot of
new factors:
Aluminum spot welding is much
slower and a lot more exacting. The
shape of the electrodes, the intensity of
the welding current, the pressure and
timing of the mechanisms holding the

held to more accurate limitations and
demand a much higher degree of con-
trol.
Other welding methods such as torch
or gas welding, arc welding, and seam
welding, are also applicable to alumi-
num. We find, however, that in each
case, we are faced with the same exact-
ing factors of time and skill which defi-
nitely place this metal far behind steel
as a practical medium for large quantity
production.
Another factor which should not be
overlooked is the service problem. Steel
panels rarely fracture under average im-
pact loads and it is nearly always possi-
ble to make a satisfactory repair job by
driving the metal back to its original
leading manufacturers of wood products
are fabricating plywood structures for
the aircraft industry. They are pro-
ducing major sub-assemblies such as
wings, fuselages, tail sufaces, etc., for
modern training and combat planes,
following rigid government specifica-
tions and designs.
The various laminated wood parts
and assemblies cover a very wide di-
mentional range depending upon their
respective functions and stress require-
ments. Single sheet sizes are almost un-
limited, running as high as SO feet or
more. Individual thicknesses vary from
.015 to Vs of an inch and these are
used to build up the laminated assem-
blies to an overall thickness varying
from Vi n" to 6" and more. The variety

traffic . . ."
shape. By comparison we find that
hardened aluminum body panels and
fenders will crack and tear under similar
conditions and bumping out is definitely
out of the question.
In view of the above, it seems that,
in the event we decide that the saving
in weight is of primary importance and
that the basic cost penalty of aluminum
over steel is not objectionable, we would
find that, from a practical manufactur-
ing standpoint, we could best take ad-
vantage of such substitution by adopt-
ing aluminum, not for the body and
sheet metal parts, but for chassis parts
such as castings, forgings, and chassis
members where the weight concentra-
tion is the greatest and where fabrica-
tion methods would not be materially
affected by the change in material.
c
OXSIDERIXG now the Plywood
Body: At present, many of the
of usable kinds of lumber includes
Spruce, Birch, Mahogany, Poplar, and
Walnut. Balsam and Fir are also used
for non-laminated parts such as fillers
and stringers.
The lamination process itself con-
forms fundamentally to age-old practice.
Various layers or plies are coated with
glue on all contacting sides, generally
by spraying or by passing through
rollers. They are piled up or "stacked"
with the grains running in alternate di-
rections; and the stacks are then placed
in presses between heated forms, with
suitable pressure provided to hold the
laminations to the desired shape during
the glueing process. Pressures vary from
50 to 250 pounds per square inch and
the drying or curing cycle requires from
l1/^ to 50 minutes or more, depending
upon the thickness of the laminated as-
semblies and the intensity and type of
heat used for drying.
The one outstanding fact, which is
also the greatest limiting factor in the
fabrication of formed plywood parts, is
that so far no one has yet been able to
"stretch" wood. This means that prac-
tical forming, using uniform sheets for
the plies, is confined to single-curva-
ture surfaces often called "wrapped"
surfaces, thus limiting the designers as
well as the manufacturers to very sim-
ple formations and shapes.
The advances made in plywood con-
struction, as outlined above, are without
doubt most outstanding, thanks to the
development of the new bonding me-
dium which eliminates all crews and
nails from the entire assembly. When
comparing this type of construction to
standard aluminum alloy aircraft de-
signs, there is no question that the ply-
wood design is far simpler and makes
possible great savings in critical mate-
rials, man-hours, and cost. This is, of
course, due to the extreme complication
of metal aircraft construction which as
yet has never been designed for high
quantity production.
If on the other hand, we attempt to
make a similar comparison between ply-
wood construction and modern automo-
bile design, we find that plywood is at
a very distinct disadvantage in man-
hours and cost. Automobile body struc-
tural design has been refined to such a
point where a minimum number of in-
dividual stampings are necessar\T to
make a complete assembly. Plane equip-
ment makes is possible to fabricate
those individual stampings at a far
greater speed than is possible with wood
laminations; also, in ordinary times, the
steel itself will be much easier to get,
and at far lower cost, than the various
types of wood required for adequate
fabrication.
If plywood construction were used on
automobiles, we would have to abide
by the severe limitations pointed out in
the previous paragraphs. This means,
first of all, that our designers would
have to confine themselves to much sim-
pler shapes and surfaces. Serious prob-
lems would also be connected with the
assembly of the various units of the
body to each other as well as to auxil-
iary parts, and also the mounting of
those units to the main chassis struc-
ture.
The question of service and repairs
in the field of plywood bodies and parts
would be even more complicated than
most of us realize. In fact, no reason-
able suggestion has been advanced so
far by any one in the industry. A new

have to be developed.
IN REGARD to the plastic body:
No other term has been abused quite
as much as the word "plastics." The
average human mind has a distinct aver-
sion to anything it does not understand;
it prefers simplicity and generalities,
and here at last was a product whose
properties supplied all the answers. In-
deed, we were told that this material
could be made out of almost anything
from beans to coal, or from any sur-
plus stock we may happen to have ly-
ing around; that it could be molded to
any shape, in any finish, in any color
and presumably to any size; and that it
could be made to replace metal, wood,
rubber, glass, and even fabrics. In fact,
there seemed to be no reason why every-
thing from fountain pens to bombers
could not be made out of plastics.
The fact is, that the one-piece all-
plastic automobile body is definitely out
of the question, since it has been estab-
lished that the production of pure homo-
geneous masses of plastic material is
only acceptable when confined to com-
paratively small, non-functional, and
non-stressed parts.
In looking over the numerous varieties
of plastic developed so far, we find that
as a whole they all have many remark-
able individual properties, but also
many distinct shortcomings, and that so
far no one plastic has yet been devel-
oped which possesses all the qualities
and none of the faults. The most com-
mon disadvantages are brittleness, dis-
tortion under various atmospheric con-
ditions, and excessive cost; and these
factors are the ones directly responsible
for the dimensional limitations imposed
upon homogeneous plastic parts in in-
dustry.
The manufacturing of larger parts has
been under serious consideration for
some time by the plastic industry and a
great deal of progress has been made
along those lines. In such cases, a filler
has been used in combination with a
plastic bonding medium or binder. The
filler serves a double purpose by reduc-
ing the amount of plastic material re-
quired and thereby lowering the cost,
and also by contributing very substan-
tially to the strength of the finished
parts.
At present, however, the chances for
manufacturing entire automobile bodies
°n a production basis of laminated
plastics of any kind are still very re-
mote.
CURVED windshields and side
lights: A definite design charac-
teristic of the much publicized futur-
istic car is the display of a wide expanse
of curved transparent material to take
the place of the conventional doors and
window glasses, and also a bulbous bay-
window type windshield extending in
one piece all around and over the driver
and the front seat passengers. Some
times this transparent material is ex-
tended into the top and it has even been
suggested that the entire upper struc-
ture of the car could be made of one
single piece of shaped glass or trans-
parent plastic material.
Let us first consider the possibilities
of curved glass: It has been established
by the glass manufacturers that flat
plate glass provides maximum clarity
of image and freedom from distortion,
and that any departure from a flat sur-
face results in a reduction of highly im-
portant optical properties.
Experiments have shown that a glass
having a 60 inch uniform bending radius
and mounted at an angle of 45 degrees
represents the extreme condition which
is acceptable for commercial use in au-
tomobile windshields and side lights.
The curvature must be uniform, of cyl-
indrical shape, and with the axis of the
cylinder in a vertical position.
Any deviation from these limitations
such as excessive angularity, smaller
bending radii, compound curvatures, or
even cylindrical bends about a horizon-
tal axis, will emphasize the optical de-
fects and physical disadvantages of the

FRONT-LINE AIR BASE CONSTRUCTION
by
WILLIAM C. MEECHAM, '45Phys.
The Army Air Force Engineers build and defend airfields all over the globe.
THE importance of air power in
any military operation is indispu-
table. Recognizing this fact, the
Army Air Forces in 1940 established a
special engineering branch to the ground
forces whose sole duty was to build and
maintain the advance air bases which
were soon to be needed. The task of
building such bases was in itself tre-
mendous, and it was aggravated by the
obvious difficulties of transportation in
(he early phases of any military opera-
tion.
The Army Air Force Engineers are
trained chiefly to build the advance
bases, other units being used to con-
struct the larger and more permanent
home bases. The requirements of such
an advance base are relatively simple.
The first and most obvious item is
the runway. For heavy bombers, the
runway must be six thousand feet in
length with a minimum width of sixty
feet. If the base is needed quickly and
if the terrain is unsuited to a natural
runway, steel landing mats are used.
The mats come in ten foot lengths, each
section weighing about sixty-five pounds.
(To show the difficulties involved in
building an advance base, we observe
that one runway of steel landing mat,
large enough to accommodate heavy

bombers, would weigh over one thous-
and tons.) These landing mats proved
their worth during the Japanese ad-
vances in the Aleutians. Preceding the
attack on Dutch Harbor, several bases
were built using the mats, one bein^
completed in ten days of the worst of
conditions.
Following the construction of the run-
ways, the next consideration of the
base-building engineer is the completion
of the taxi tracks and the storage plots
for the planes. Dispersion is the watch-
word always, as any bunching of planes
would be fatal in case of attack.
The operational center is usually of
splinter-proof construction and is well-
camouflaged because of its primary im-
portance. During the first few weeks of
operations, bombs are stored at a safe
distance from the field under camou-
flage nets, but they are given more
careful consideration later. Gas is fre-
quently stored in the lightweight and
portable tanks which have been seen
often in newsreels. Of course large un-
derground storage tanks are later con-
structed, following the successful estab-
lishment of the base.
Frequently, as in the African cam-
paign, the Air Force Engineer is called

One thousand tons of steel mats go into a New Cuinea airfield.
-pon to defend the base a fter he has
once built it. Thus he must have fight-
ing as well as constructing ability. He
must be able to handle anti-aircraft
?uns and all other equipment of mod-
ern defensive air warfare.
Because of the diversity of his task,
the engineer is subjected to extensive
training. The experience he has gained
while building air bases in England has
proved extremely valuable towards this
end. The importance of dispersing air-
ports is one of the axioms of air war-
fare Which the AAF has learned from the
British. (It was largely because of its
air base dispersal that England was
able to weather Goering's Luftwaffe at-
tack in 1941.) Because of our freedom
from danger of attack, American bases
have been built near one another for
convenience of transportation and sup-
ply. In England, as well as in certain
African theatres, natural runways were
suitable, thus removing the necessity
of bringing in the heavy landing mats.
Several bases in Africa where the ter-
rain and weather conditions were favor-
able were completed in less than ten
days, one taking only four days.
The construction of any type of air
base, whether landing mats are used or
not, requires a large amount of mechan-
ized equipment. The transportation of
the bulldozers, scrapers, rollers, and
other necessary rolling stock is often the
most serious problem involved in the
building of an advance base. In Africa
this problem contributed to the inade-
quate upkeep of runways, which were
often almost unusable because of dust
or mud, depending on the season. This
problem of transportation was eventu-
ally solved, however, as were many
others of its kind, by the ingenuity of
the Air Force Engineers.

Landing strips in the Aleutians were laboriously constructed on filled - in land.

IT'S ALL OVER-
WE cannot fail to realize that
as far as the United States
and Great Britain are concerned, the
war in Europe is still in its ini-
tial stages. Furthermore, the "real"
war, involving a super-human effort
and a fight to the finish with all the
destruction and brutality that go with
it, is yet to come. The prediction by
one of our top military leaders that
America will suffer 500,000 casualties
within the next month therefore ap-
palls us, but it did not come unex-
pectedly.
We believe that this will sooner
or later spell the end of that "life as
usual" that most of us have been
leading here at home. It has been
said that in no other country is there
such a contrast between the sacri-
fices made by the soldier and those
made by the civilian. Was it not
Michigan's own Tom Harmon who
said here in Hill Auditorium that the
best thing that can happen to the
United States would be a bombing of
Detroit?
Apparently we are not doing
enough. We gripe because we don't
get any meat. In Japan housewives
wait for hours in front of a store for
the privilege of buying a fishhead or
a carrot. Most of us have failed to
make any notable sacrifices. The en-
gineering student on this campus,
and we believe on all other campuses
in these United States as well, is no
exception to this rule. Let's take a
typical U of M engine student. What
is he doing to get this war over with?
"Well I'm carrying 18 hours this
term, ain't I?" is the reply that we
BUT THE FIGHTING
are apt to get. Now here is a male
member of the human race who is
almost perfect physically, and who,
because of the specialized training he
is receiving here, was not inducted in
the armed forces. But is this young
man going the least bit out of his
way to help win the war? He isn't
doing anybody any favors staying in
school, studying Engineering, getting
his B.S.E. degree, and then going out
to find a position with employment
opportunities and premium salaries
he couldn't hope to find in peace
times.
The point we are trying to make
is this: the University Hospital needs
help, King-Seeley Corporation needs
help, everybody needs help. Surely
every engineer knows how to run an
elevator or operate a drill press. And
most of us can spare two or three
hours every day. We would help win
the war, we would earn part of our
expenses, and it might prove to be
valuable experience. Remember those
Joe College days? Are "them days
gone forever?" No, but at least that's
how long the war may last if we just
sit here without doing anything
about it.

Local industry could easily put these "executives" to work.

Later, he came back through Europe
where he has seen nearly every country.
In America, he thinks the most beauti-
ful spot is Balboa Park in San Diego.
When he graduates in June, Johnny
expects to work on flight research, possi-
bly in California. He says he hates to
leave the University .... thinks it is a
wonderful place. His principal ambi-

IT has been written by sages of the

wise man. Those philosophers proba-

know Rupert Straub.
Rupe is the type of fellow the engi-

typical engineer. He's about six feet of
man, blond, and handsome. Though
studying to be an automotive engineer
takes most of Rupe's time, he's had
enough left over to become the Secre-
tary of the Union. In this capacity
Rupe manages to get around to most
of the dances on campus and has had a
hand in planning some of the bigger

AT a stage show at the Michigan
Theatre recently, a magician
walked down to the footlights and asked
a young lady to step up on the stage.
"Now as a climax of my act," he said,
"I am going to saw this young lady in
two, right before your eyes."
The crowd cheered and stamped its
feet.
"As is customary before doing this
act," he continued, "I'd like to make
sure first that you all want to see . . ."
A thundering "SURE."
"And that there are no objections to
my performing . . . ."
A "NO" rocked the house.
"The girl's sorority sisters—do they
object?"
"Not at all, to be sure."
"How about you?" he asked turning
to the girl. "Do you mind being sawed
in two?"
The girl shook her head.
"Well, then," the magician said.
And he sawed the lady in two.
We all thought it was funny as hell,
but the police made quite a fuss about
it.

ANOTHER month has just slipped
by. Spring has stepped in to free
N'ature of the icy tentacles of Winter,
who, resigned to the oblivion of April
through November, is making a desper-
ate attempt to keep what part of March
he may. Myriad flora have blossomed
out almost overnight to reveal Nature's
ethereal trousseur. Children are play-
ing, bareheaded, in their most treas-
ured heritage: sunshine, green grass,
butterflies. Men are spending what free

moments they can snatch from this all-
out civilization of ours where they right-
fully belong—in the out-of-doors. Moth-
ers—old mothers, young mothers, and
mothers-to-be—are strolling through the
park; whole families are taking new de-
light in Mother Earth with the aid of
Victory Gardens. Yes, everywhere Spring
is paving the way for the Summer which
is to come.
Everywhere, that is, except in Ann
Arbor. The damn fool Spring always
stops at Ypsi and goes around. Whether
it is a conspiracy of the U. S. Weather
Bureau or another intrigue of the Board
of Regents, that transition point between
bitter cold and sweltering heat, Spring,
just doesn't come to Ann Arbor. The
only transition we have is the monsoon
which supplants the bitter cold or swel-
tering heat on Arboretum days. (Note
—for a complete technical explanation
and a detailed description of newest de-
velopments in weather, see the TECH-
NIC of Nov., 1942, Reflects, p. 20).
* * *
HOWEVER, far be it from us to dis-
cuss anything so prosaic as the
weather. Instead, let us choose an un-
usual topic on which to discourse. For
example, almost everyone is acquainted
with the origins of the names of the
days, but not many people are familiar
with the source of the names of the
months. Take April, for instance—•
while you've got it take it far away.
The beginnings of April go back to an-
cient times, when one Olongo and his
wife Oolongoe lived in a charming dup-
lex hole in the Himalayan mountains.
One day, when Olongo had just returned
to their little lair, the following conver-
sation took place (We have, at great
pains and expense, been able to translate
from the ancient Etruscan into Tibetan,
then back into modern Etruscan, from
there into Chinese, whence we translated
into pidgin English. Since English is
much easier to understand than pidgin
English, we went back, by way of
Siamese, into Hindustanee. From there
we translated in the form which fol-
lows):
Oolong: Hello, dear, where hast thou
been?
Olong: Yea, verily have I been
hunting.
Oolong: And didst thou catch much?
Olong: Yea, verily, more than the
average man.
Oolong: Knowest thou, Olie, what
day this is?
Olong: Yea, verily is it March 31,
16943 B.C.
Oolong: And dost thou know what
the morrow is?
Olong: Yea, verily is it Aprillovitch 1.
Oolong: Olie, I have pondered well
the subject, and I think Aprillovitch
could be shortened to Aprillovit.
Olong: Yea, verily.
There was yet another change to
come, this time in the fourteenth cen-
tury A.D. In this century the Book-of-
the-Moon Club came out with a best-
barterer by one Geoffrey Chaucer, which
began with the words:
"What that Aprille with his shoures
soote
The droghte of Marche hath perced to
the roote, —"
From here it is but a short step to
the form we know today. It is said that
the "e" was dropped off during the
stormy voyage of the Mayflower.

LAST Saturday while polishing the
eight ball in the billiard room of the
Union, I happened to spot a character
at the coke machine. It was quite ap-
parent that he had been indulging in a
liquor other than cokes. He put a nickel
in the machine and out came a coke.
He then put in another nickel and out
came another coke. After he had ac-
quired twenty cokes I strolled up to
him and mentioned that maybe he ought
to quit. He pulled himself up with a
little difficulty, looked me square in the
eye, and said, "I should quit when I've
hit a winning streak?"

Yesterday someone did something that will
make tomorrow better.
We do not mean to be Pollyanna. We
are totally engaged in the grim business
of producing for war. But it is still hard,
realistic fact that the good things of to-
morrow are being planned today, were
planned yesterday. Jobs, for instance. Your
future job.
This is one reason why we enjoy working
with aluminum. It's full of possibilities for
making new things, and making old things
better. The future of aluminum is exciting.
There is now much more aluminum and
it costs less. It will be usable in many more
places. Alcoa has been imagineering in
aluminum for 54 years and we have good
reason to feel the postwar future of alumi-
num is something for a man to want to
have a part of.
Look what aluminum can do to help
patch up this shattered old world. It's the
wings of the Air Age. It is going to tie

remote peoples together and help bring
about understanding.
Aluminum's strength with light weight
makes things easier to lift, less expensive
to move. It offers another spurt of growth
to all forms of transportation.
Alcoa Alloys in brilliant colors promise
a new splurge for beauty. Think what you
can do to brighten homes and hospitals,
stores and schools with a metal that is
easy to work, resistant to corrosion, light,
strong and capable of being dyed practi-
cally any color of the rainbow!
We have seen a lot of good imagination
engineered into plans utilizing Alcoa Alloys.
We have done some Imagineering of our
own, too.
These plans are today's blue-prints for
tomorrow's jobs. Many of you younger men
will be needed to turn them into action. In
fact, we hope some of you will want to help
put across the ideas we have been cooking
up here at Alcoa.

archimedes up to date
UTILIZING the hydrostatic laws of
Archimedes—principles that were
first discovered in the days when Icarus
and Dedalus were the two top names in
aviation—engineers of the Glenn L.
Martin Company have devised an in-
strument that goes a long way towards
solving a problem which has been troub-
ling designers and operators since man's
first flight—the proper loading of air-
craft. Known as the Hydrobal, it is an
automatic weight and balance indicator
which has already been installed in sev-
eral Martin flying boats.
A sort of super-accurate Plimsoll's
mark (the load line which is painted on
the side of all British and American sur-
face vessels) brought inside the hull for
easy reading, the Hydrobal makes use
of two well-known facts: (1) that the
distance from keel to waterline (draft)
of a boat hull is proportional to its
loaded weight; and (2) that the angle
at which the hull floats (trim angle) is
a function of the loaded center of grav-
ity. The Hydrobal provides rapid and
accurate readings of draft and trim
angle which can be quickly plotted on a
calibrated chart to obtain the loaded
weight and center of gravity.
sent* CH

The instrument itself consists of a
three-inch diameter standpipe installed
near the bow, and another one near the
second step. Small openings in the hull
bottom admit water to the standpipes.
The combination of restricted inlet and
large standpipe eliminates inaccuracies
due to waves or slight pitching of the
airplane while a reading is being taken.
Each standpipe contains a float with
a graduated rod which sticks up through
the top of the pipe, and waterline read-
ings are taken of the intersection of
these float rods with the top of the
standpipe.
The average of the fore and aft read-
ings is proportional to the weight. The
difference of the two readings is propor-
tional to the trim angle. To find the
weight and center of gravity, it is only
necessary to plot the readings on a pre-
viously calibrated chart.
The Hydrobal requires no complicated
adjustments or servicing, and it may be
prepared in kit form for service installa-
tion. Accuracy is dependent only on
the original calibration and on the
manufacture of all floats to an identical
buoyancy.
In the opinion of Martin engineers,
the Hydrobal is destined to play an im-
portant part in the future air cargo pic-
ture. In many cases it may result in the
choice of seaplanes over landplanes, due
to its simplification of loading opera-
tions and the resultant saving in loading
time and handling costs. With this in-
strument it now becomes possible to
load an airplane, take a rapid reading,
and then, if the weight or center of
gravity are not within the desired lim-
its, to remove or shift some of the cargo
in accordance, thus solving a problem
that has increased in seriousness as fly-
ing boats increase in size.

SET THE PACE ON AIRCRAFT PRODUCTION

IN the aircraft industry, on thousands of vital jobs,
STANDARD Carboloy tools have set the pace on ma-
chining production! Cutting speeds stepped up as high
as six times faster than with former tools! Tool life in-
creased often as much as 20 to 1! Finish, on critical parts,
so fine that 75% or more of hand-polishing time is elimi-
nated! Close tolerances once believed "impossible" on
mass production work, commonly obtained. Production
of vital parts often doubled or tripled.
On aircraft manufacture—as well as in all other indus-
tries vital to war—STANDARD Carboloy tools have helped
point the way towards new economies, new production
peaks. These tools—at prices comparable to all other
cutting tool materials—are available in 10 styles, 5 grades,

a General Sherman tank, with the sta-
bilizer, in action.
Engineers who built the device for
holding a tank gun steady while speed-
ing over rough ground needed an ac-
curate means for checking the perform-
ance of the gyroscopic control. Actual
firing is expensive and is not an accur-
ate test of the stabilizer because it in-
cludes errors of gunner's judgment in
allowing for windage, range, projectile
characteristics, etc., over which the sta-
bilizer has no control. To do the job,
Army Ordnance engineers designed a
novel photographic device.
A camera, built for taking pictures
rapidly on standard miniature film, is
clamped to the gun barrel. The expo-
sures are made through a telescopic lens
with crosshairs. As the tank bounces

over the rough test course the gunner
"fires" in the regular manner, "shoot-
ing" a picture of the distant target in-
stead of firing a projectile at it. The
film shows how well the crosshair inter-
section follows the target—thus record-
ing the combined performance of sta-
bilizer and gunner. Several "hits" are
shown above.
Comparative performance of stabilized
and unstabilized guns can be measured
by applying a camera to the gun bar-
rels of two tanks, one stabilized, the
other not. Next, the two steel monsters
stage a "fight" under warlike conditions.
The photographic record of "hits" and
"misses" is then compared to determine
the merit of the stabilized control.
Another photographic scheme carries
the test one step further. A movie cam-
era is similarly mounted on the gun bar-
rel. By an arrangement of mirrors and
a v-slot it takes a continuous double
motion picture of the target as "seen"
both by the gun barrel and by the tank
frame. This combined record shows
the performance of the gun. In addi-
tion, the amount of scenery change indi-
cates the roughness of the ground tra-
versed.

battledocks
ANOTHER addition to the maze of
letter-designated vessels is the
YFD, which by some unexplained trans-
formation signifies the new "self-dock-
ing" dry docks. These barges are made
in two sizes, the larger being sufficient
to raise a battleship completely out of
the water, and the other being "cruiser
size."
The dry docks have no means of self-
propulsion, and must be towed from
place to place. They are trough-
shaped and have a raised platform
which may be above or below the water
surface, depending on the amount of
ballast in the tanks on the sides of the
docks. Damaged vessels are towed onto
the dock through the open ends, and
then the whole structure is raised by
pumping out the ballast. The ship then
rests high and dry and ready for re-
pairs.
The YFD's are made in three sec-
tions which are fitted together endwise
to form one long dock. Sections of a
dock itself may be raised on adjacent
sections for repairs on the hull of the
dock. These versatile repair "ships" are
proving their value on all the fighting
fronts today, for they are keeping our
fleet units in fighting trim without the
necessity of their returning to a home
base.

TESTING is an integral part of
steel production at Allegheny
Ludlum mills, because one of the
"must" requirements for an alloy
steel today is that it possesses—to
the full—every one of the special
properties desired by the user.
To help prevent failure of a part
during operation, amazingly accur-
ate machinery, worth thousands of
dollars, is on the job at each Alle-
gheny Ludlum mill, testing each
lot of steel before it is shipped out
to become lighting parts of planes,
tanks, guns, ships or munitions.
These steels must be right, for in
the urgency of battles tremendous
stresses are put upon the key parts
for which alloy steels are chosen—
and those parts must not fail when
men's lives are at stake.
It is under such war conditions
that Allegheny Ludlum steels have
proved their worth. Right now
they're helping to uphold the tra-
ditions of a free America, so that
all of us may retain them in the
future. When peace is restored,
Allegheny Metal and other alloy
steels will take their rightful place
again in the enrichment of the
post-war world.
But now—today—these metals
are supporting the attack. Be sure

flood control
(continued from page 26)
GREAT developments in the field of
flood and erosion control are indi-
cated by the progress of a land recla-
mation project now nearing completion
in southern Missouri. A non-profit or-
ganization known as the Little River
Drainage District was, at the request
of the land owners, formed to clear and
drain the fertile land in the area. At the
present time, 90 per cent of the 550,000
acres in the belt have been converted to
rich agricultural country.
Closely related to the work of prepar-
ing the land for farming was the prob-
lem of preventing floods from destroy-
ing the recently-cleared ground. With-
out any protection, the drainage and di-
version channels would have been rap-
idly enlarged and extended with each
rainfall. Thus it became necessary to
provide some sort of soil-retaining ma-
terial over the beds and embankments
of the channels.
Flexible concrete mats were used to
prevent such erosion. They were con-
structed of 9 by 16-inch building blocks
wired together with %-inch wire cable.
The assembled mats were placed on the
stream beds as shown in the illustra-
tions. In general, three mats were
placed lengthwise on each channel, one
on each bank and one along the bottom
overlapping the other two. On the less
active streams, willow matting was used
in the same manner, as shown in the in-
sert below. In view of the rapid disap-
l&gt;earance of valuable soil in other dis-
tricts, the protection of the beds of the
drainage and control ditches was ex-
tremely satisfactory.
Three flood-control basins have also
been constructed in the Little River

region. They are connected by channels
protected with concrete mats, as de-
scribed above, and they store up the
surges of water which flow in the Spring
and Fall. Levees 16-feet high protect
the lowlands surrounding the main ar-
teries in the reclaimed region.
The success of the project will un-
doubtedly spur the organization of simi-
lar flood-control work in other unpro-
tected areas. Every year, thousands of

acres of valuable farmland are destroyed
by rampaging waters, and coupled with
the similar erosion of soil by wind, the
loss is extremely serious. The use of
concrete protective mats is an important
step in the development of flood-control
practices, and they will see considerable
service after the war. In the meantime,
the war effort is aided by the supple-
mentary produce of these many re-
claimed acres.

PIPING is more than
a line on a blueprint...
npRANSLATING a piping blueprint into terms
J. of pipe sizes—kinds of fittings—types of valves
will have much to do with determining whether
an engineering project is a success or a failure.
For almost any project is inconceivable without
piping, which controls the flow of air, gas, steam,
water, oil or other liquids.
You are probably familiar with the high quality
— the precise manufacture — that characterizes
valves and fittings made by Crane. You may not
know that the Crane line includes equipment for
every need of every piping system everywhere.
Writing "Crane" on a complete piping speci-
fication has many advantages to the engineer.
First: He knows that every item in the system will
come from one source, saving valuable time all
down the line from drafting room to final assem-
bly. Second: The project will have a matched
piping system—with all parts designed to work
together. But, above all, he is assured of the long
life and satisfactory operation that come from the
exact design and high quality that are a part ot
every piping item carrying the name Crane.

glass and will make the car so equipped
entirely unfit for comfortable and safe
operation on the highway.
Due to the many additional opera-
tions involved in the fabrication of
curved or bent glass, the cost is very
substantially higher than the price of
flat plate glass. The installation of
curved glass into the bodies also pre-
sents many new problems in sealing
and weatherproofing due to the exces-
sive dimensional tolerances required by
the glass manufacturer as compared
with the close limitations established by
the steel body frames.
Curved glass, being vulnerable to
strains from all angles, is not as well
capable of withstanding excessive road
shocks, nor the distortions of a conven-
tional body structure mounted on a
semi-rigid chassis frame; we would have
to develop an entirely new technique in
mounting the glass, or expect a much
greater percentage of failures in the
field. In addition, we would also have
to face new complications in the han-
dling, packing, shipping, and storing of
curved glass; crates would be bulkier,
breakage would be higher and unless all
curvatures were standardized, it would
be necessary for replacement dealers to
carry in stock exact sizes and shapes for
each car, thus requiring large inven-
tories in all stages of the servicing and
distributing process.
In regard to the clear plastic enclo-
sures: The real motive behind the com-
mercial development of clear plastics
was to produce a material which would
have the properties of glass and none
of its disadvantages. Clear plastics have
the property of light transmission and
conductivity; they are not brittle and
consequently not subject to breakage
in handling, and are also easily cut and
trimmed. They can be molded to any
pre-determined shape and can be re-
shaped or rebent to any form, with the
help of comparatively inexpensive equip-
ment. Still we find that they also have
certain inherent limitations and short-
comings which restrict them to their own
individual fields and which, incidentally,
make them definitely unsuitable for the
manufacturing of enclosures and super-
structures for automobiles.
First of all, the optical qualities of
clear plastic materials are far inferior
to those of plate glass. It has indeed
been recognized that the best flat sheet
of transparent plastic that can be
molded on a commercial basis, is opti-
cally wdrse than the cheapest kind of
window glass. When molded into curved
shapes the optical conditions become
impossible and all that has been said
about the unfavorable properties of
curved glass, can be repeated on a mag-
nified scale for curved plastics.
Another major shortcoming of the
clear plastics is their low factor of sur-
face hardness in comparison with glass;
they are subject to abrasion and surface
scratches even under normal conditions.
The simple operation of wiping off road

"Many 'weird' pictures have been
painted for the benefit of the average
citizen."
dust with an ordinary cloth or the ac-
tion of the windshield wiper operating
over the usual amount of dust deposited
on the car or in suspension in rain
water, will leave very definite marks,
which will multiply from day to day
until the material has lost most of its
transparency. In night driving, each
one of these numerous hair scratches
creates its own individual refraction
problems, with the result that everyone
of the points of concentrated light and
their subsidiary reflections now appear
to have halos and look like so many
moons in a foggy sky. If the condition
becomes extreme, the halos expand and
overlap until they cover the entire sur-
face, and the material must be replaced
for lack of visibility.
From a structural standpoint, we
know that the all-curved plastic upper-
itructures and enclosures, while being
chatter-proof, would not be any stronger
than glass of similar shape, and they
would be far less dependable than the
conventional steel and flat glass com-
bination.
From a cost angle, we may state as a
basic comparison that at present a sheet
of clear plastics, whether flat or curved,
costs about twice as much as a cor-
responding amount of laminated safety
plate glass of similar shape, and that
even though we may anticipate a sub-
stantial price reduction of plastics after
the war, we feel sure that glass will, for
many years to come, retain its place in
the industry as the most economical,
most efficient, and most practical mate-
rial for the fabrication of automobile
windshields and standard enclosures.
THE last point to be considered is
the general design and architecture
of the car: The question of architecture
and appearance of the postwar produc-
tion automobile is, of course, wide open
for discussion and for differences of
opinion. Still we may state with abso-
lute certainty that it will not resemble
the popular sketches of rolling solariums
or crystal balls so enthusiastically and
persistently suggested by "the experts."
The radical designs which are being
submitted as postwar cars show us that
the front seat is to be moved still farther
ahead than it was on the latest pre-war
models. The front passengers will have
to sit at least partly between the front
wheels and in some instances directly
over the front axle. In so doing, we will
have to deny these front seat passengers
all previous considerations, because ac-
cording to present standards, they will
not only have lost all riding comfort,
but will also have been deprived of a
convenient means for entering and leav-
ing the car.
We know that some vehicles such as
trucks, busses, transport planes and
even on one make of automobile, the
driver's seat has been placed away
from the door, but in each case adequate
head-room has been provided to permit
the passengers entering or leaving the
vehicle to walk nearly in an upright po-
sition. The expert postwar designers
are definitely not making allowances for
such headroom requirements.
Aside from the question of headroom,
it would also be necessary to provide
some means of access to the front seat,
either by a center aisle located between
individually divided seats, or by a clear
passageway on either side. Many of the

BUTADIENE
for the Government's Synthetic Rubber Program
(INSTITUTE, W. VA. PLANT)

Night vieu- of the immense butadiene plant at Institute. W. Va.
A LITTLE OVER A YEAR AGO* the first tank car of butadiene
was shipped from the Government's large integrated rubber
project at Institute, W. Va. This historic shipment came from
the immense butadiene plant which was designed and built by
Carbide and Carbon Chemicals Corporation for the Gov-
ernment's Defense Plant Corporation—and is being operated
bv this Unit of UCC, for the Rubber Reserve Company.
FIRST YEAR'S PRODUCTION OVER THE RATED CAPACITY—
that is the record of this huge 80,000-ton-per-year plant during
its first twelve months! This has been accomplished in spite of
the manv inherent problems that had to be solved in starting a
wholly new project of this magnitude.
Over 8/10 of a short ton of butadiene is required to make
about one long ton of Buna 8 tvpe synthetic rubber. Butadiene
from this plant during the past year has provided more than
90,000 long tons of synthetic rubber for the Nation's require-
ments, both military and essential civilian. The delivery of this
all-important ingredient also has made possible early produc-
tion of synthetic rubber under the Government's program.
•Tin first I.ink ...rlo.nl of butadiene from Institute was shipped on February IB, 1943
— less Ih mi one month after I nil No. 1 of the four Urge butadiene-prndurin., units
had started operating. Subsequently. I'nit No. 2 started produeing in M.ir.li. I it11
No. 3 in April, and toil No. 4 on May 25, 1943.
NOW HUGE BUTADIENE PRODUCER — although originally
designed to produce 80,000 tons annual capacity, the Institute
plant is now delivering butadiene at a rate of more than 100.000
tons per year. An identical plant using Carbide's process was
put into operation by the Koppers United Company in Sep-
tember, 1913, at Kobuta, near Pittsburgh, Pa.
OVER 75% OF THE TOTAL PRODUCTION OF BUTADIENE
for the Government's synthetic rubber program in 1943 came
from the alcohol process developed by Carbide and Carbon
Chemicals Corporation.
In addition to the plant at Institute, Carbide made available
plans for the large plant at Kobuta. which was built and is
being operated for the Government by Koppers United Com-
pany.
Carbide and Carbon Chemicals Corporation also has
designed and built for the Defense Plant Corporation, and is
operating for the Rubber Reserve Company, another large
butadiene plant at Louisville, Ky.

Business men, technicians, teachers, and others are invited to send

do, and what their place is in the Government's rubber program.

loss to visualize how the passengers can
possibly be expected to get to their seats.
Even if we concede that they would be
willing to climb over the backs of the
unoccupied seats when folded down, we
wonder how the last passenger would
manage to get in at all; and it would
certainly be even more interesting to see
a demonstration in reverse, showing
what kind of a contortionist's trick
would have to be performed by the first
one desiring to leave such a crowded
compartment.
Some designers have recognized this
problem, and have confined the capacity
of the front seat to two passengers with
a center aisle between them. Others
show a single driver's seat located in the
center of the job. However, any such
variation reduces the passenger-carrying
capacity of the vehicle unless a third
seat is provided in the rear, and in this
case we would find it necessary to en-
large the car beyond all practical limi-
tations of wheelbase, over-all length.

Until Victory has been won, all the Timken
Tapered Roller Bearings we can make will
continue to go into war equipment of all
kinds and into the many different types of
machines that help to make them.
When the war is over however, Timken
Bearings again will be requisitioned for
peace-time requirements of transportation
and industrial equipment. Then the knowl-
edge you acquire now will enable you to
meet any and every bearing condition you
may encounter in the future; for Timken
Bearings have everything it takes to do a
complete bearing job—ability to eliminate
friction; to carry radial, thrust and com-
bined loads; and to hold moving parts in
correct and constant alignment.
Learn to know your bearings now; this
knowledge will pay dividends after Victory,

conventional 56 inch front axle tread
and 27 inch O.D. tires, the clearance
between the front wheels when fully
cramped, is approximately 32 inches:
this is not enough for two passengers
and could accommodate only a single
seat with access passageway.
Now if we decided to preserve our
present three passenger front seat and
move it between the front wheels, we
would have to adopt a front axle tread
of 82 inches and an over-all fender
width of 94 inches with exposed wheels,
or about 110 inches (a little over 9
feet) with wheel covers. The tragic sid?
of this picture is that if we were in-
duced to buy such a car and we drove
it home, we could not pass any other
car of similar size with safety, and if
we did manage to reach home, we could
not get the car in our garage due to its
excessive width.
Ever since the first sketch of the
"teardrop" car was made, about IS
years ago, we have heard a lot about
moving the engine to the rear. This
again is a feature which has been ad-
vocated by the stylists for no good rea-
son at all, except that it fits into the
"teardrop" silhouette. The possibilities
of this proposal have been thoroughly-
investigated by the majority of the au-
tomobile manufacturers, but so far no
sound functional argument in favor of
such rearrangement has been advanced
by any of the technicians.
In reality, the only practical reason
we may possibly have for moving the
engine to the rear of the car would be
to move the passengers all the way for-
ward, and we already know all about
that.
F,ven if we find some practical an-
swers to the previously outlined com-
plications arising from such a design,
we would also have to give serious con-
sideration to an important psychologi-
cal problem before such a car could be
offered to the public. It would, indeed,
be interesting to know what the average
motorist's mental reaction would be, if
and when he takes out the new car for
a trial run and finds himself sitting
right out in front going 80 to 90 miles
per hour, with 95 percent of the weight
of the car behind him. and no apparent
forward protection other than a front
bumper and a glass or plastic bay win-
dow. Somehow we have grown attached
to long cowls and hoods; they give us
a feeiing of importance and immunity,
and even though they do restrict our
vision, we have gradually learned to op-
erate our cars with comparative safety.
T\ J E BELIEVE that it is unfair and
* * unwise to lead the public to be-
lieve that after Victory Day or very
soon thereafter, they can be assured of
entirely new products, possessing mirac-
ulous features, at ridiculously low
prices. As stated before, it was not the
purpose of this paper to foretell what
the postwar automobile would look like:
we have merely tried to point out the
reasons why it cannot be as claimed in
the fairy tales.
We hope that our remarks may help
to dispel some of these halucinations.
and that they may induce our stylists
and designers into tempering their in-
dividual ambitions and bending all their
efforts toward the conception and devel-
opment of the all-important, really
practical consumers' goods. Only in this
way will they be able to lend any ap-
preciable assistance in the tremendous
task of stabilizing our social and eco-
nomic lives and guiding our beloved
country through the many dangers and
uncertainties of the postwar readjust-
ment period.

Taylor and White's great discovery which made
possible high speed cutting was the greatest single
development to help make mass production pos-
sible. The steel developed, commonly known as
18-4-1, served industry faithfully for over thirty
years without a serious competitor.
In the early 1930's the first molybdenum high
speed steels were used on a substantial commer-
cial basis and, before the Second World War,
about 259c of all tungsten high speed steels had
already been replaced by molybdenum high speed
steels on merit. This steady progress of logical
replacement of the tungsten steels was interrupted
by the war because of the tungsten shortage, when
many industrial plants were forced to a sudden
change to molybdenum steels.
Because of the stress of war production many
concerns have never had an opportunity to
satisfy themselves thoroughly as to the com-
parative merits of the molybdenum high speed
steels. For those, in this category, who are in-
clined to return to the tungsten steels, we sug-
gest a serious consideration of the following
facts—molybdenum high speed steels perform
as well as, or better than, tungsten steels—and
they cost less.

more ore
What is said to be one of the largest
iron ore deposits in the world will be
opened this year as a source of supply
for the United Nations war plants, at
Caue Peak, Brazil. This area is easy to
equip, develop, and mine, and contains
fifteen billion tons of high grade ore.
There are also adequate transportation
facilities and power in the neighborhood.
Beginning this year and continuing for
three years, annual planned production
of one and one-half million tons of the
ore will be divided between the United
States and Great Britain.
night sight
On night raids, Allied airmen now
wear oxygen masks from the time they
take off until they land because recent
research has disclosed that the rod cells
of the eye, used in night vision, require
a greater supply of oxygen than the cone
cells, used in day vision.
faster fighters
A recent development in the field of
synthetic finishes has increased the
speed of Uncle Sams planes 15%. By
fine grinding of the pigment of the lac-
quer which covers these warriors of the

erably reduced. Details of this coat are
still military secrets.
stopping sinus
University of California scientists
have recently been treating sinus con-
ditions with sulfathiazole. The drug is
applied directly into the involved si-
nuses. Failure of the treatment in a
third of the cases has been due to the
abundance of inflammatory tissues near
the sinuses.

A conception of the trend in modern
factory architecture can be gained from
these shots of a windowless, futuristic
aircraft plant. War shortages dictated
the use of brick and tile with no steel
framework in the wall construction. 20
miles of continuous fluorescent lights
with non-metallic reflectors produce uni-
form, comfortable illumination.

steel,
L conceived in
the mighty heat
of the electric furnace, is just being
born when it teems into ingot
molds. From here it rapidly multi-
plies into countless forms and
shapes, reaching maturity within a
matter of days as parts in finished
warplanes, tanks, guns, ships or
munitions.
Many of those products will be
better, and will perform their war
job without fail—thanks to the
quality control exercised by Alle-
gheny Ludlum on every batch of
alloy steel leaving its mills. It's a
rigid control, true, but very neces-
sary to give our fighting men the
decisive edge in battle that better
equipment assures. And the same
close control, coupled with Alle-
gheny Ludlum's research activities
—now developing still better fight-
ing steels for our armed forces—
will continue after victory is won,
to help create better peacetime
products for you.
But before there can be peace,
we at home must exert every effort
to win the war. Collection of scrap
metal, salvage of waste fats, con-
servation wherever possible and
regular purchases of war bonds are
your contributions from the home
front. Only thus can you give the
men behind the guns the tools to
assure victory.

THE inter-American portion of the
Pan-American Highway will soon
be open for two-way traffic.
This is the trunkline from Laredo,
Texas, to Panama City; the Pan-
American Highway includes the high-

of South America, all of which will be
linked by this portion of the highway.
Its completion marks the realization of
a plan made fifteen years ago at the
Fifth International Conference of Amer-

The main purpose of the highway
was to further development of the in-
ternal economies of the countries
through which it ran. However, our
purpose in helping to finance it was to

Associate Professor of Chemistry
The e'ec'ron diffraction camera is a valuable tool in the identification of unknown compounds
encountered in industry.
THE development of diffraction
methods for studying the internal
struction of materials started
about thirty years ago with the discov-
ery by VTon Laue in Germany that an
X-ray beam is reflected by a single
crystal in a way depending on the in-
ternal arrangement of the atoms in the
crystal. In England Sir William H.
Bragg devised his well-known relation
between the X-ray wave length, A., the
angle of incidence of the beam on the
plane of atoms, ®, and the distance be-
tween the atomic planes, d; nA = 2d
sin©. Bragg was able with this equa-
tion to interpret the X-ray reflection
data from many crystals. For example,
he first reported the alternating arrange-
ment of sodium and chlorine atoms in
the corners of tiny cubes in the crystals
of sodium chloride. While the great
penetrating powers of X-rays makes
them well suited for studying the in-
ternal structure of solids, it prevents the
use of X-rays in studying the very thin
layers which often occur on the surface
as the result of corrosion, wear, or con-
tamination with foreign matter.
Twenty years ago it was observed by
Davisson in the laboratories of the Bell
Telephone Company in New York City
that a beam of electrons is diffracted by
solid materials in a manner analagous
to that of X-rays except that the low
penetrating power of electrons makes
their diffraction pattern characteristic
of the surface of the solid. Later work
by Thomson and Finch in England, and
Kikuchi in Japan led to the develop-
ment of electron diffraction as an im-
portant tool in the investigation of the
surfaces of solids.
The principle of the experiment is il-
lustrated in Figure 1. Electrons emitted
from a hot cathode are accelerated by
about 40,000 volts to an anode with a
hole in it through which the main elec-
tron beam passes. The cross-section of
the beam is limited by a 0.010" hole in
a platinum diaphragm. The electrons
pass along the axis of a coil of wire
which is enclosed in an iron sheath with
a gap in the center and which acts as
a magnetic lens. The electrons travel-
ing on paths diverging from the axis
are brought back to a focus at the cen-
ter of the photographic plate in the left
of Figure 1. A specimen whose surface
is to be investigated is interposed be-
tween the lens and the plate, and some
of the electrons are scattered by the tiny
crystals composing the surface of the
solid to give a characteristic diffraction
pattern.. This pattern usually consists
fo a series of a circular arcs whose spac-
ing and relative intensities are deter-
mined by the chemical nature of the
scattering material. Figure 2 shows
such a pattern from iron. Since every
crystalline chemical substance gives a

distinct pattern of its own, the pat-
terns obtained can b" used for the chem-
ical identification oi the material.
One form of the equipment used is
shown in Figure 3. The enclosed table
in the lower left of the figure supports
the diffraction camera. Since electrons
are readily scattered by a;r, the camera
is made vacuum tight ai J the vacuum
pumps and controls are: 'loused under

the extreme left is the section holding
the photographic plates, while the cham-
ber holding the specimen is next in line.
In front of that is the magnetic lens and
ionization gauge, and finally the corru-
gated poreclain tube housing the elec-
tron gun. The remainder of the equip-
ment shown provides high potential di-
rect current at about 40,000 volts con-
trolled to within about ten volts.
The usefulness of the electron diffrac-
tion method is best demonstrated by
describing some specific applications.
Aluminum alloy sheets have long been
used in the fabrication of aircraft, but
with the accelerated production rate
required by the demands of war, the
older method of riveting the joints in-
volved too many operations and was too
slow. Spot welding of the aluminum
sheets was substituted for riveting, but
the condition of the aluminum surface

was of cruci. importance in successful
welding. The metal oxide occurring on
aluminu .. ..-.• be treated either by me-
chanical abrasion with emery paper,
wire brushes, or by a chemical solution.
The electron diffraction pattern from
the brushed ^surface showed that the
pure aluminum was exposed by this
treatment, but again the mechanical
operation was too slow for high pro-
duction rates: A chemical treatment was
given by i mixture sold under the name
of "Oxide Remover," with the implica-
tion that the acid solution would dis-
solve the oxide leaving clean, free metal.
The treated surface however, gave the
pattern of ALO:1, and it was demon-
strated that a suitable prepared surface
containing a thin oxide layer could be
used for welding. Other treatment in-
cluding neutral or alkaline solutions
gave rise to still other forms of alum-
inum oxide, but no chemical treatment
could be found which would leave a
clear, free surface of metallic aluminum.
Another interesting application in
connection with the aluminum problem
arose when the specimens treated in
certain tanks developed a black smut on
the surface. This smut interfered with
the welding operation. It could be re-
moved with wiping cloths but the extra
operation again slowed down production.
In the electron diffraction camera a
specimen covered with this smut gave
the pattern of metallic copper, where-
upon it was discovered that the solution
in the tank was contaminated with traces
&lt;&gt;f copper from the Monel metal heating
coils. The substitution of lead heating
coils removed the source of the trouble-
some contaminant.
The surface activity of metals more
stable than aluminum has also been
demonstrated in a number of cases by
electron diffraction. For example, the
practice of de-greasing a metal surface
in a vapor bath of trichlorethylene is
supposed to leave a clean, free metallic
surface. This treatment, when applied
to a metallic copper, however, leads to
a diffraction pattern of cuprous chloride,
which forms an invisible thin layer but
has a very considerable effect on some
of the surface properties of the copper.
When copper is immersed for a short
time in a cold dilute KC1 solution, the
diffraction pattern of copper oxide is
obtained.
The properties of steel and iron sur-
faces are especially interesting. The
iron patte_n shown in Figure 2 is ob-
tained when the surface is abraded light-
ly to remove the metal oxide. If the
specimen is dipped momentarily in
dilute alcoholic nitric acid or allowed to
stand in moist air, the surface becomes
coated with rust, which the diffraction
pattern shows to be FeOOH. Upon
heating such a surface to a high tem-
perature, this layer is dehydrated and is
converted to Fe.,0, (Figure 4). When

Fig. 4. "The diffraction pattern of
abraded cast iron is that of graphite ..."
cast iron is rubbed either with fine
emery or by the action of a piston ring
in a cast iron cylinder, the electron
diffraction pattern is that of graphite.
Graphite inclusions in the iron are op-
ened up by the rubbing action and a
layer of graphite is spread over the sur-
face of the metal. The graphite layer
assists in the lubrication of the bearing
between two moving parts, when one is
cast iron.
Another application of electron dif-
fraction to lubrication problems is il-
lustrated in Figure 5. This shows the
pattern given by a nwnomolecular layer
of a long hydrocarbon chain on a smooth
metallic surface. The spacing of the
parallel lines and of the spots shows
that the staggered hydrocarbon chains
are lined up with their principal axis
perpendicular to the metal surface and
with carbon atoms spaced at almost ex-
actly 0.00000001". The existence of
these orientated molecular layers is
thought to play an important part in the
lubricating properties of oils. It has
been found that the addition of an or-
ganic acid of high molecular weight to
a lubricating oil enhances its lubricat-
ing properties. Electrical diffraction
shows that the molecules are adsorbed
onto the surface in oriented layers which
are held more firmly than the hydro-
carbon layer.

Fig. 5. "Pattern given by a monomolec-
ular layer of a long hydrocarbon chain."
In the hydrogeneration of unsatur-
ated petroleum fractions a metal cata-
lyst, usually nickel, is used. Electron
diffraction investigations of the catalytic
nickel shows that the orientation of the
micro-crysals in the nickel surface de-
pends upon the method of preparation.
Electron diffraction is a useful tool in
studies in this field also.
Useful information is afforded by elec-
tron diffraction studies in nearly all
fields where surface properties of solids
are important. In addition to the
specific examples mentioned above,
these include the preparation of sur-
faces for painting, for vulcanizing rub-
ber, for corrosion resistance, for the de-
velopment of special wear properties,
and for special types of chemical re-
activity. Industrial opportunities for
workers in the field are growing very
rapidly as the possibilities of the method
are becoming more widely appreciated.

THE REVOLUTION OF MATERIALS
Tremendous supplies of formerly scarce materials, born of the war, will disrupt our peacetime
engineering economy.
UNDER the pressure of war, the
urgent need of special light-
weight materials for aircraft and
the critical shortages in other metals
and alloys have all exerted an influence
upon the development of new materials
and have prompted increased facilities
for the production of all manner of use-
ful engineering materials.
For example, the need for aluminum
was so acute as to demand additional
facilities for its production. After the
war, aluminum producers may have
from four to five times the capacity that

"The post-war era will afford an abundance of low-alloy, high grade steels."
existed before, provided all newly cre-
ated facilities remain in the picture.
Magnesium, which is one-third lighter
than aluminum, was exploited to its
fullest extent only during the war. It
has proved invaluable in many air-
craft applications in the form of sand-
castings, permanent mold castings, and
will be available in vast quantity when
the war is over.
The same can be said of plastics. We
have realized increased availability of
molding powders and molding facilities
and the development of new and useful
formulations. In the field of synthetic
rubber-replacing materials, the growth
of Government-sponsored facilities has
been nothing short of phenomenal. And
there has been corresponding progress
in many other respects too numerous to
mention at the moment.
The latent potentialities by way of
new applications for these materials
are so breath-taking as to furnish the
fuel for wide-spread speculation by in-
dustrial designers, sales promotion peo-
ple, and newspaper columnists. The
flow of speculation along these lines has
been in flood tide, exciting the imagina-
tion of the man-on-the-street.
12
THE MICHICAN TECHNIC


indeed, from the standpoint of industry,
the full benefits of the situation can be
realized only through mature engineer-
ing analysis by people who have the
training and ability to make such ap-
praisals. In the final analysis, the use-
fulness of any structural material de-
pends upon its engineering economy
through its availability. Historically it
is a fact that all engineering materials
are constantly in competition with one
another, and their utilization depends
upon the nature of a given problem and
its elements of economy.
If aluminum or magnesium are to dis-
place commonly-used materials, such as
steel or cast iron, they will do so in
such instances where physical proper-
ties are satisfactory, where prime costs
are competitive, or where other engi-
neering considerations outweigh these.
For example, ultimate economy may
make it desirable to redesign an exist-
ing mechanism or part so as to utilize
another type of material. Often times
even if a new material is somewhat
higher in cost per pound, the cost of
fabrication may be sufficiently lower to
result in overall economy. These are
all elements of what has been termed
engineering economy.
In any event it is obvious that Sun-
day supplement stories only confuse the
issue. For a sound, business-like ap-
proach to this vital problem it devel-
ops upon the producers of new materials
to study the engineering problems of
their users and to embark upon an edu-
cational program designed to unfold the
technical properties of these materials
and to show engineers and designers of
these properties. Unless engineers are
thoroughly acquainted with the advan-
tages and limitations of each type of
structural material they cannot handle
the situation in an intelligent manner.
The competitive nature of engineer-
ing materials may not be fully appreci-
ated. Zinc die castings replace sheet
metal stampings and castings for hard-
ware, for decorative parts, and for many
useful mechanical applications. Steel
stampings replace castings and forg-
ings; forgings replace castings. Yet
castings are replacing forgings for cer-
tain internal combustion engine cam-
shafts and crankshafts. Despite this,
special light-weight steel forgings have
replaced sheet metal fabricated assem-
blies in military aircraft. The pattern
is in a state of flux. And in the words
of Kettering—"the only thing that is
constant is change."
Certain types of synthetic rubber
have replaced natural rubber where the
effects of temperature of flexure or the
the solvent action of fuels and lubri-
cants and chemicals have ruled out the
natural rubber or latex for all applica-
tions.
High-tensile steels and stainless-steel
alloys have been extremely useful in the
development of structures such as light-
weight trains and buses and truck
bodies. But these applications have
been chosen judiciously to justify and
amortize the higher costs involved.
What of conventional carbon steels
and alloy steels? Restrictions born of
the war turned to the development of
the so-called "NE" steels, containing
smaller proportions of alloying ingredi-
ents but in most cases, a greater variety
of alloys. These have worked out ad-
mirably under close metallurgical con-
trol both in their production and in their
application.
The post-war era will afford an abun-
dance of low-alloy, high grade steels
which may easily revolutionize steel mill
economy. Lower cost per ton, greater
volume, simplification of grades—these
characteristics will make steel a power
to reckon with in the post-war competi-
tive struggle for position.
Finally, it may be observed with
profit that engineers must acquire a
good working background of the revolu-
tionary and evolutionary progress made
during the war in the field of engineer-
ing materials. This encompasses a thor-
ough appreciation of their advantage as
well as their limitations. Given this
background, the principles of engineer-
ing economy may be judiciously applied
for the solution of any given problems.

CULTURE: NOW OR LATER?
by
ALFRED H. WHITE
Retired Chairman of the Department of Chemical Engineering
When should an engineer obtain a general education?
OUR young engineers have little
conception of the improvement in
working conditions since their fathers
started to work. Only twenty-five years
ago, I worked in a mill which operated
with twelve-hour shifts seven days in the
week, with the men changing from the
day to the night shift on alternate
weeks. Those who came off the day
shift on Saturday night could look for-
ward to a full night's rest and one free
day before they started on the night
shift. The following week they worked
not only Saturday night but all day
Sunday as well, a straight twenty-four
hour shift, to pay for their free day of
a week before. This mill was not un-
usual in its working schedule. The steel
industry did not change to the eight-
hour shift until several years later. Engi-
neers in the drafting rooms, laboratories
and offices did not work as long hours as
those in the operating divisions but the
ten-hour day and six-day week was the
general rule here. Whatever an engineer
did, his work was so fatiguing that he
had little energy for any constructive
program to utilizing his few leisure
hours.
The discoveries and developments of
the scientist and the engineer have lib-
erated the worker and incidentally the
engineer himself from the serfdom of
drudgery. The young engineer, like the
laboring man, now works only forty-
four hours or perhaps only forty hours
a week. After adequate time for sleep
and recreation, there still remains a sub-
stantial residue of hours which should
be devoted to self-improvement.
The engineer has been reproached by
a past generation for his lack of culture,
for his failure to assume adequate lead-
ership in public affairs, and for his in-
effectiveness as a speaker and a writer.
The remedy prescribed has frequently
been a two-year general college course
as a precedent to the engineering school.
Culture defies exact definition, but it
is certain that it cannot be imparted by
feeding a student a prescribed intel-
lectual diet. It demands not only
breadth of knowledge, but also thought-
ful consideration of the implications of
this knowledge and its application to
our way of life. Nearly fifty years ago
the story was told of the Chicago mil-
lionaire who was reproached with the
lack of culture of his city. His reply
was, "No, Chicago hasn't gotten around
to culture yet but when she does, she'll
make the old gal hum." The million-
aire spoke truly when he implied that a
young and growing organism is chiefly
interested in the material things which
promote its immediate welfare. The
mysterious thing called culture can only
come with maturity.
A generation ago if the young engi-
neer was to acquire a general education,
he had to get it before he started to
work, because for the next twenty-five
years he would have to devote all his
energy to his job. If the older engineer
did not assume the expected leadership
in public affairs, it was because of the
strenuous demands of his professional
work.
This emancipation of the adult from
exhausting, deadly toil cannot but affect
our educational systems. Adult educa-
tion has already become a great move-
ment and it is incumbent upon us to
examine our educational procedure and
see if it is fitted to carry this new
superstructure. The adult and the child
alike do well in those studies which in-
terest them, and they are interested in
those studies which seem of immediate
importance to them. The college fresh-
man who wants to be an engineer digs
into his mathematics because he knows
that a knowledge of that subject is es-
sential. He is often impatient of his-
tory and literature because they do not
seem important for his future career. He
will work at English if proficiency in
that subject can be shown to be import-
ant to his professional success.
Our undergraduate engineering pro-
grams give the student some work which
he recognizes as professional even in
his freshman year. If he likes it, well
and good. If he does not, he can change
his program at the end of a year satis-
fied that he belongs somewhere else
and ready to make a serious try at his
next interest. When he graduates, he
has a working knowledge of English
and the principals of economics in addi-
tion to his scientific and technical edu-
cation. Most important is his training
in observation, experimentation, and de-
duction. A young man with this equip-
ment and with some leisure can extend
his knowledge as he sees fit.
The Engineers' Council for Profes-
sional Development has prepared lists of
books which will be helpful. Evening
classes are numerous in the large cities.
There are not so many organized facili-
ties for self-improvement in small cities,
but even in small towns there may be
found a group of men and women in-

taxation, health and public schools ap-
peal to the young engineer as a member
of the community. The news of the
world prompts a study of historical
backgrounds, the distribution of racial
groups, and the problems which arise
from unequal distribution of natural re-
sources among the various nations.
Music, art and literature attract a group
whose interests are not satisfied by the
movie and the juke box. If the young
engineer is wise he will associate him-
self with these forward-looking groups
and, by study and reflection acquire a
general education and, in time, culture.

PRESENTS

HENRY L. SCHMIDT, JR., is one
of the few vagabonds typical of
the old college days still left on campus.
Last summer he travelled at least 2,000
miles hitch-hiking back and forth to
Grand Rapids. In spite of the fact that
he is going to school in Ann Arbor he
still practically lives in Grand Rapids.
You might have thought he hibernates
on the week-ends—he does—in Grand
Rapids. The reason? Why, a woman of
course.
The fact that he was born on St.
Patrick's day seems to be the only rea-
son Hank can give for studying engi-
neering. He has had the idea in his head
as long as he can remember and believes
he must have been born with the idea.
When he came down to Michigan in
the fall of 1940, Hank was determined
to take part in as many class functions
as possible so it was only natural for he
and his friends to plan for big things on
black friday. However, much to his dis-
appointment, the Sophomores were very
uncooperative. Hank and his friends
spent the entire night hunting but to no
avail.
It was shortly after this that he
pledged Sigma Phi fraternity. As evi-
dence that the draft is working well he is

the last member of his pledge class of
sixteen still on the campus.
He thinks there's nothing more enjoy-
able than basking in the sun. This may
be one of the reasons why he spent last
summer in school, for he claims to have
spent every afternoon on the roof of the
Sigma Phi house. Since he has been in
Ann Arbor, though, his biggest problem
has been finding some other way to
spend his leisure time during the rest of
the school year, for Ann Arbor weather
being what it is, was not meant for sun
bathing. Perhaps, this was the reason
why he tried out for track in his fresh-
man year. He later went on to take sec-
ond place in a Big Ten race and as a re-
sult obtained a reserve award.
As president of the Inter Fraternity
Council, President of Sigma Phi frater-
nity, Vice-President of the Engineering
Council, member of Triangles, Vulcans,
Men's Judiciary Council, Tau Beta Pi,
and Pi Lambda Upsilon, Hank Schmidt
has certainly made his mark on campus.
Should you be unable to find Hank at
the I.F.C. office might we suggest the
East Engineering Building, for he is also
working as a student assistant to use up
the rest of his spare time.

JUST as football has gone to war, so
have its heroes. We find that war
plays no favorites, not even with Michi-
gan, so Bob Wiese, captain of our great
football team, has joined the Navy to
do his part.
Bob hails from North Dakota, and if
you think we have cold weather here,
you should hear him tell about the win-
ters at his home. Bob lived in a col-
lege town, but he wanted to go away to
school . He was attracted to Michigan
because he had heard so many wonder-
flu things about the engine school here
and, incidentally, because of our pow-
erful football team. Mechanical Engi-
neering is the field in which he is spe-
cializing. He planned to work at the
Buick plant in Flint, Michigan, follow-
ing graduation, However, the Navy has
decided to make full use of his skill as
soon as he finishes his training. When
Bob has completed his course here, he
will be sent to midshipmen's school be-
fore active duty. He has been in the
Navy since July, and his only complaint
is that there is not enough liberty.

SUshff
as Robert L. Wiese
Although Bob is best known as a
hard-driving fullback, he also plays ex-
cellent basketball and baseball for Mich-
igan. In general, like most sportsmen, he
likes recreation, such as tennis. In the
somewhat less strenuous field, he likes
dancing, mystery stories, and mystery
movies. On campus, he is prominent as
president of Sigma Nu and a member of
Michigamua and Triangles. In spite of
all his social and athletic activity, Bob
has maintained a good scholastic stand-
ing.
People are often misled into thinking
that Bob is shy because he is the "quiet
type," but he admits that when he has
time, he has his share of fun. Bob is
most quiet when football is the subject;
then, modesty prevails. The quiet peo-
ple are often the most interesting ones,
however! His football training has kept
him pretty much along conservative
lines, however, and he only very "oc-
casionally" indulges in spirituous liv-
ing.
To him, Michigan is the best, but he
feels that war has changed it quite a
bit. Most outstanding is his observation
in regard to Michigan tradition, most
of which he thinks has been lost in the
hubbub of war, condensed courses, and
lack of social activity. Although he be-
lieves that students still learn as much
at Michigan, the spirit one usually finds
in a school this size has almost disap-
peared. Here's to the former days of
spirits—whoops! spirit.

lean more toward the experimental view-
point than the theoretical; when Analyt
students stop wondering whether lines
are parallel or skew and begin wonder-
ing whether conies are degenerate; when
E.M. 2 students stop worrying about
the tensile strength of steel, and begin
worrying about yield points of softer

very bad, as it is liable to upset some
students with delicate nervous condi-

to put all students at ease on this—like
demobilizing the armed forces, or some-
thing equally encouraging. Army life

... a wartime problem in Engineering
THIS is a quartz crystal. Its job is to hold an airplane
or tank radio exactly on its assigned wave length—
so fighting men can get messages through quickly, clearly.
Under pressure of war's demands for immense quan-
tities of radio equipment, Western Electric engineers
have helped to revolutionize crystal production tech-
niques. Consider these problems:
Each of these little wafers is cut, ground and lapped
to almost incredible tolerances;
Each one is metal plated in a vacuum;
Each one is mounted on wires so small that many
operations and inspections must be performed under
a microscope.
Amazing new machines and methods were devised to
do such jobs quickly and well—and the crystals are
turned out in unprecedented numbers. One of our four
shops now makes as many crystals in a day as the entire
industry used to make in a year! To date, Western Elec-
tric has produced more than 9,000,000 crystals for war.
Mass production of crystals is just one of many fasci-
nating problems that have been and are being solved
by engineers at Western Electric — the nation's largest
producer of electronic and communications equipment
for war.

NEW VISIONS for Tomorrow's World
• IT DOESN'T MATTER NOW whether clouds hide
the sun, or whether evening shadows fall on the
baseball diamond. If the fans in the grandstand see
the game so can the modern television camera.
That was not always so; the pre-war television
"eye" needed as much sunshine as it could get to
illuminate the scene. The same was true of football—
final quarters were occasionally "washed out" on
the television screen.
But thanks to research, conducted at the RCA Lab-
oratories, a new super-sensitive television camera,
rivaling the human eye in its ability to see under
conditions of poor light is in prospect for the post-
war world. Then, by television you will see every
last-minute play of the ball game as clearly as if you
were in the stands. Entertainment, sports, news
events will pass before your eyes with every detail,
every shadow faithfully reproduced.
Today, RCA's research facilities are devoted to
providing the fighting forces of the United Nations

PIPING is an important part of almost every engineering
project. When you indicate a pipe line on a drawing, think
of it in terms of the pipe, the valves, the fittings, the unions, the
traps that it will ultimately be translated into. Think of the
metals of which it will be made—brass, iron or steel. Consider
how it should be assembled—bolted, screwed or welded.
The parts that make up any piping system are many, but it
will interest you to know that everything for the complete
system is included in the Crane line.
By writing Crane on a piping specification, you are assured
that the single source will save valuable time, all down the
line. You are also certain that all parts will fit, providing
simpler assembly. Long, satisfactory operation results from
the high quality which, since 185 5, has always characterized
piping equipment carrying the name Crane.

necessary for inter-country travel. Ours
was a manifold motive. First of all,
the United States is pursuing a Good
Neighbor Policy which could be most
effective through the aid of a highway
which would attract tourists and permit
a closer intermingling of the peoples of
North and South America. Besides that,
such a highway would encourage the
building of more cars and trucks and
would eventually lead to cheaper trans-
portation of economic goods between the
different countries. The construction of
the road would also account for the
creation of many man-hours of labor,
thus providing jobs for many idle work-
ers.
Despite all the progress which has
been made on the road much remains to
be done. Many miles of the road are
paved, but still greater expanses are un-
paved and have various surfacings.
Some roads have all weather surfacing,
others are dirt roads good only in dry
Some of the roads are paved, some have

only crude trails.
weather, and still others are only in the
trail stage. It is hard to visualize this
extensive road, but it can be said that
much must still be done to it before it
will measure up to American standards.
An important trouble-maker was the
extent of erosion in much of the terrain
covered. The rainy season is concen-
trated in a short period and the rain-
fall exceeds 100 inches a year. The
steep slopes of the mountains are readily
susceptible to erosion and the result is
deep washes occurring at frequent inter-
vals. The fills and deep cuts which
were required greatly increased the diffi-
culty of road construction.
Despite the large quantities of rock
which were excavated in building the
highway, there was no little difficulty
in finding good material for surfacing
and for making concrete. The brittle
nature of the rock encountered made it
unfit for these purposes. The amount of
suitable stone was surprisingly small,
and the distances of most of the quar-
ries from the road put quite a crimp in
the operations of the construction crews.
Volcanic ash which is cheap and durable
is used in the construction of bridges.
The ash, which is found near Nicaragua,
is light in weight and soft enough to cut
with a knife when quarried, however,
it hardens on exposure to air.
However, despite these difficulties,
American engineers and native laborers
have rapidly pushed this inter-Ameri-
can link to near completion. The war
has shown the need for well-developed
supply routes, and although the Pan-
American Highway may not see much
service in this one, it may become an
important factor in future hostilities.

E,
J'VEN ice know only a little of what you might do with it...
yet. Trimethylcyclohexanol (you pronounce it try'-meth'-il-sy*-
klo-hex'-an-ohl) is a new industrial chemical by CARBIDE AND
CARBON CHEMICALS CORPORATION ... made with atoms ob-
tained from common substances, rearranged into molecules
that are not known to exist in nature.
^ hat's this new synthetic organic chemical good for? No
one yet knows all of the useful things it might be made to do.
If you are technically minded you'll find some of the facts so
far discovered in the italicized paragraph at the right. Whatever
your interest, you will be glad to know that this new chemical
has potential uses in the making of such things as medicines,
plastics, lubricating oils, and adhesives.
In their service to industry as incubators for raw mate-
rials, the laboratories of this Unit of UCC are continually
developing such new chemicals. An almost predict-
able percentage of them prove to be extremely
valuable. Out of hundreds already developed have
come scores from which scientists in industry have
developed useful products of many kinds.
Some of the chemicals are used to make supe-
rior anti - freezes. Others arc raw materials for
quantity production of vitamins and life-saving
drugs. Still others make possible improved cos-

metics, plastics, textiles, photofilm, insect repellents, anes-
thetics ... and hundreds of things of benefit to you in your
daily life.
Through continuing research which is developing new ma-
terials out of common substances, CARBIDE AND CARBON
CHEMICALS CORPORATION is helping to make many things
more plentiful or more useful. And the research of this one
Unit... in that field which often must appear to the layman
as "unknown chemicals"... gives you an idea of what the
combined research of all UCC Units in many basic fields
means to you.
As Trimethylcyclohexanol is one of the newest additions to this
family of synthetic organic chemicals, its story is still incomplete.
It is an alcohol with a high boiling point (388° Fahren-
heit). At room temperature, it is a white solid with an
odor like menthol. It dissolves in other alcohols, gaso-
line, benzene, ethers, and vegetable oils like linseed
oil, but does not dissolve in water. It can be supplied
in carload quantities if and when the need arises.

system of routes that will convert the
city from a "hodge-podge of blighted
areas and modern communities'' to a
city of sanitary efficiency. It will be
constructed through the most traffic-
congested areas, starting from the foot
of Cass avenue and extending to the
foot of St. Antoine. The section at the
lower end is to be elevated from the
river front almost to Michigan Avenue.
From there it will be converted from a
double-deck construction to a single-
deck construction; ultimately, it will
merge into a depressed roadway in a
northwesterly direction from the city.
At various locations along the Ex-
pressway, there will be parking facilities
to meet the demands of traffic. These
will be made with regard to beauty as
well as to function. Besides parking
spaces, there will be parks and orna-
mental planting in certain districts.
Thus, Detroit plans her "city of the
future"—and for at least two excellent
reasons: for the sake of economy and
safety—traffic breakdowns, which cost
at least half our driving time, will be
prevented or cut down—and to provide
jobs for a great number of the 17,000,-
000 men who will need them during our
conversion from wartime to peacetime
operations.

NEW Westinghouse developments
are expected to be a great help

light has been perfected, in design simi-
lar to the sealed beam auto head-light,
which is brilliant enough to illuminate
the welder's work even while he is sight-

narily he must depend upon the light of
the arc to illuminate his work.


The light helps the welder see with his
helmet down.
View through a helmet: top—without
spotlight; center and below—with light.
Spot welders have not been forgotten
by Westinghouse either. Their chief
trouble was in placing the spot to be
welded directly over the lower electrode
while the work was in the machine. A
miniature spotlight will now do the align-
ing on mass production work for them.

Welded glass pipe isn't available now
except to certain war plants. But it's an-
other interesting development that points
to a greater use of glass when some of the
present restrictions on production are be-
hind us. Others are a new type of glass so
resistant to thermal shock that it can be
heated cherry red and then sprayed with
ice waterwithout breaking;"ribbon glass"
in sheets almost as thin as cellophane; and
a new method by which accurate shapes
of almost any size or description never
before possible in glass can be quickly
formed.Glass is going to play a major
role in post-war. And Corning will be
there with what it has learned during
the war plus a background of nearly
a century of glassmaking experience. You
can count on it. Glass, the material with a
sparkling future, will keep full pace with
your own sparkling future as an engineer.

mosquito boats
TT IS to one of these maneuverably
*• little boats that General MacArthur
owes his present safety. The pertinent
facts about this boat are, however, very
little known. The motor PT boat can,
if required, travel at a speed of 70 knots
(over 80 miles an hour, civilians); fast
enough to easily out-maneuver any
heavy gun fire from its prey. The boat's
cruising range is 2,000 miles, while op-
erating on one engine only. It is pow-
ered by three 12-cylinder Packard en-
gines, each developing 1,350 horse-
power. Some idea of the power involved
may be derived from considering that
each cylinder develops more horse-
power than the entire engine of a
"Packard Six." That means the power
of over 36 Packards operating a boat
70 feet long with a beam of about 15
feet drawing only 4 feet of water. The
boat's crew varies from 9 to IS men
with one to 3 commissioned officers
aboard. This is comparable to the crew
of the Flying Fort.
A recent smaller edition of the PT
boat, the Barracuda, has been perfected
for shipboard transportation. It is
equipped for easy conversion between
many of the following types of craft:
topedo boat, machine gun boat, smoke
screen boat, depth charge boat, or flame
thrower boat.
A novel feature of the Barracuda is
the internal installation of the topedos,
which are launched through the stern of
the boat. The torpedo racks, however,
may be completely removed and re-
placed by batteries of machine-guns or
by any of the several other installations
listed above. The ship is powered by
two 800 horse-power engines placed
side-by-side between the torpedo racks.
Judging from its offensive power and
adaptability, we should be getting re-
ports on its usefulness from the Japan-
ese soon.

Above: Traveling at speeds of 50 to 70 knots, the
mosquito boat can easily outmaneuver any heavy gun
fire from its prey.

hydrogen makes steel brittle
Tiny amounts of hydrogen in steel,
even as small as one two-thousandth of
a per cent by weight, can make steel
brittle, and should be avoided in making
metal where toughness and ductility are
essential. This was indicated in a re-
port to the American Institute of Min-
ing and Metallurgical Engineers.
While the effect of hydrogen is evi-
dent in ordinary steel, it is exaggerated
in most steels containing manganese. On
the other hand, certain special man-
ganese steels do not show it. This is at-
tributed to a different arrangement of
the molecules in the lattice that makes
up the metal crystals. In general, more
hydrogen is dissolved in the "face cen-
tered" than in the "body centered" lat-
tice. In the body centered lattice, the
atoms are arranged in cubes, one at each

WHETHER it is a hydro-elec-

— a water works or a steam
power line—a cargo ship or a
refrigerating system, or any of
hundreds of other engineering
projects that you can mention—
piping controls the flow of air,
water, oil, steam and gas that are
so necessary to their operation.
And piping means more than
a line on the blue print—it means
lengths of pipe of the correct
diameter—it means valves and
fittings and traps and joints—it
means flanges and cocks and
gauges and floats of the proper
sizes and proper types to assure
the maximum service for the sys-
tem you are designing.
But many and varied as are
the parts of the piping system,
it will interest you to know that
they are all included in the com-
plete Crane line.
And when it comes to writing
specifications, you will find what
many engineers before you have
discovered: that by specifying
"Crane" for the whole system,
you are assured of matched
piping with all parts designed
to work together, plus the long
life and low up-keep that mean
efficient, satisfactory service.

CAR3ON DIOXIDE FIRE PROTECTION
by
NORMAN H. SIEBENS
Research and Development Engineer
C-O-Two Fire Equipment Company, Newark, N. J.
Recent developments in CO fire extinguishing equipment have
become invaluable in the war effort.
CARBON dioxide fire extinguishing
equipment has been in wide use for
a number of years for putting out fires
in gasoline, oil, and other inflammable
liquids, for protecting electrical appara-
tus, and for a variety of special applica-
tions, such as safeguarding irreplace-
able records that are susceptible to
water damage. Under the stimulus of
war, some of these applications have
been broadened and developments have
taken place which will remain as a con-
tribution to peace-time safety.
High-pressure carbon dioxide for fire
extinguishment is contained in steel
cylinders having capacities ranging from
2 to 100 pounds. It is applied by means
(of built-in systems, which are used for
safeguarding specific hazards of consid-
erable magnitude, and portable extin-
guishers, which are used for safeguard-
ing minor hazards and for mobile fire
protection.
Recent developments in carbon di-
oxide protection for electrical equip-
ment are exemplified by the C-O-Two
installations at the Boulder Dam and
Bonneville Dam power houses and at
Grand Coulee, which upon completion
will be the world's largest single source
of electricity.
At this plant, hand and wheeled type
portable carbon dioxide extinguishers
are used for protecting small electrical
equipment; a total flooding system pro-
tects the 230 kv. switchyard oil house,
the oil room, and the oil filter room;
and large systems safeguard the huge
generators, which consist, at present, of
six 108,000 kva., two 75,000 kva.
(house) units.
Typical of these special systems is
'h"e one serving three of the 108,000
kva. units. This system has two bat-
of 50-pound carbon dioxide cylin-
ders, one of 5 cylinders for the "de-
layed" discharge.
Should the temperature within any
generator reach 185°F., an automatic
thermostat release causes the opening
of the generator output circuit, opera-
tion of a selector valve directing the gas
discharge to the generator affected, and
the discharge of the "initial" cylinder
battery. At the same time, signal lamps
are lit, and alarms sounded in the gen-
erator and main control rooms.
The initial discharge extinguishes the
fire; but in order to maintain enough
gas within the generator to insure the
complete extinguishment of all glowing
or smoldering material, carbon dioxide
from the delayed discharge battery is
released until the rotor comes to rest
and for a sufficient period thereafter.
The marine field was one of the first
to adopt carbon dioxide for fire protec-

watt FM broadcasting station.
EDITOR'S NOTE:
Mr. Clinc, Instructor in Electrical
Engineering here at the University, is
more than just the author o) this article.
Aside from receiving his M.S. in Elec-
trical Engineering here in '41, he also
belongs to Sigma Xi, Junior Research,
the old U oj M Radio Club, and elec-
trical honor society, Eta Kappa Nu.
Mr. Cline is also a radio "ham," his
call letters being W80SP, and he holds
a first class radiotelephone license.
Credit should be given to Mr. Carl
H. Wcsser, chief engineer of Detroit's
FM station WEN A, who is actively en-
gaged in the design of the station, while
Dave Norton, the University's Radio
Technician over in Morris Hall is

in Mr. Cline's article as one of the
builders of Michigan's old station
WCBC, is now teaching Electronics here

first of all, what is FM?
This pair of letters is an abbreviation
for "frequency modulation," in contrast
to "AM" for "amplitude modulation.
These are the names of two different
types of broadcast transmitters and re-
ceivers. While the latter, AM, has been
and probably will be used for many
years by standard broadcast stations
such as WJR and WW J in Detroit, the
former, FM, is commercially just begin-
ning to attain popularity.

the difference between FM and AM?"
The answer is one which is rather in-
volved, and there is not enough space
here for a complete technical explana-
tion. To put it very briefly, in conven-
tional AM systems, it is the amplitude
of the radio frequency carrier wave
which is varied (modulated) in accord-
ance with the sound picked up by the
microphone, while in FM, it is the fre-
quency of the carrier which is varied.
This is brought out in the G.E. cut at
the bottom of the page.
an FM station
sounds different
If you are very close to the transmit-
ter so that the signal-to-noise (noise,
static and interference) ratio is very
high, a high fidelity AM station and a
high fidelity FM station sound exactly
alike. (The words "high fidelity" apply
to a sound reproducing system where
the quality of reproduction is essen-
tially perfect, so that programs sound
remarkably real, clear, and natural.)
However, if you move toward a location
where the signal-to-noise ratio is not as
high, the noise gradually increases in
intensity in the AM system, until it is
necessary to reduce it by making cir-
cuit changes in the receiver which de-
stroy the high fidelity response. In
contrast, the principles underlying the
FM system are such that noise does not
become noticeable until the signal-to-
noise ratio reaches a much lower value,
and for this reason an FM receiver can
reproduce a high fidelity program un-
der average conditions against an al-
most perfectly silent background.
Most FM broadcasting stations and
radio sets are specially designed for

finds himself thinking of high fidelity
sound reproduction as the ultimate ob-
ject of broadcasting, forgetting that
other things, such as the program con-
tent and the artist's talent, for instance,
are far more important. In fact, a few
listeners considered to have good musi-
cal tastes and to possess good damatic
sense manipulate the tone control of
radio sets in such a way as to destroy
high fidelity response, and like it bet-
ter that way.
A special radio set is required for FM.
Both the transmitter and receiver cir-
cuits are different from those used in
AM. With most present day AM radio
sets, the FM stations cannot even be
found on the dial, and even with AM
sets where the dialing range does extend
to cover the FM station frequencies,
only a listener with a rather uncritical
ear would call the reception satisfactory.

coincident range finders
V\7ITH the Allies in the midst of
» » World War II, modern artillery
reached a veritable state of perfection.
While the guns themselves were being
developed, other engineers were busy
with another problem—that of perfect-
ing a machine which will tell the gun-
ners the exact distance from the gun to
their target. Because of the large
amount of research done on this project
the Allied forces are now in possession
of range finders that far excel those of
the enemy.
The function of a range finder is to
solve a relatively simple problem in
trigonometry with great rapidity and ac-
curacy. Under ordinary conditions such
a problem could be solved by the aver-
age schoolboy who has been acquainted
with the fundamentals of trigonometry.
But in the midst of a naval battle or ar-
tillery barrage there is no time to con-
sult logarithm tables and trigonometric
functions. The distance from the gun to
any number of targets must be obtained
at a moment's notice.
The basic problem is to find the dis-
tance to the vertex of a triangle, being

Part of the data required for
effective fire control of guns
such as these is supplied by the
range finder operator. As he
brings the range finder to the
proper distance reading, he will
see the top half of the circular
field shift to the left and when
on target the two halves will be
in perfect alignment.

given the base line and base angles. The
most popular and efficient machine for
this type of work is known as the coin-
cident range finder. It is built in the
form of a long tube at the ends of which
are pentagonal prisms which receive the
light. During the last war tubes on a
similar type of range finder measured
fifteen feet in length. However, the
length of those on the present models is
still a military secret. Pentagonal prisms
are used because after careful research
it was found that the inner wall of a
pentagonal prism is the most perfect
mirror available. Pentagonal prisms may
also be rotated slightly without disturb-
ing the emergent beam, therefore allow-
ing fine adjustments to be made quickly.
The light beams pass through telescopes
within the tube and are reflected at
right angles to the tube by the coinci-
dence prism which is in the center of

One of the early approaches to range
finding problems consisted of two

the tube, and from there through the
eyepiece to the observer. Light coming
from the right end of the tube passes
through the upper half of the coinci-
dence prism and thus forms the top of
the picture. Similarly the light from the
left end supplies the bottom to the pic-
ture. In this way the observer sees a
split image, the two halves coming from
opposite ends of the tube. These two
halves may be made to coincide and
form a perfect picture by simply moving
a ranging wedge. This wedge moves on
a calibrated scale from which the dis-
tance may be read directly. In this way
the operator needs only to keep the
image coincident and the range may be
read off instantaneously.

A. S. T. R. P.
214 more Army men arrive on campus for specialized training.
REALIZING the need for more and
more technical skill, the U. S.
Army has sent to the University of
Michigan a new group of men under
the Army Specialized Training Reserve
Program. These seventeen year olds are
the successful participants of the Army
A-12 exam given last March 15th and
may be distinguished from their
brothers in the A.S.T.P. by the exten-
sion of the yellow background around
the regular A.S.T.P. insignia.
In general the A.S.T.R.P. is sub-di-
vided into three groups known as the in-
troductory, basic, and special. It is
planned to give the members of the first
group three twelve week semesters at
the expiration of which they are to be
called to active duty with the army
and will be processed for general assign-
ment. The basic group, however, have
a little different set-up. Though re-
maining in school for the same num-
ber of semesters, they carry a slightly
heavier program. After completion of
their course, they are to be sent to basic
training. Following this, those who have
made satisfactory grades are eligible for
assignment to the regular units of tbe
A.S.T.P.
Segregation into these respective
groups was made on a basis of the in-
dividual A-12 scores, the classification
test they received upon arrival on cam-
pus, and their high school records.
Members of the above groups are
men who, upon entrance into the pro-
gram, had not as yet reached the age
of seventeen years and six months. Pre-
viously they had no college instruction
but had successfully completed high
school. For those who had already at-
tended college a third group was formed.
These men follow a more advanced pro-
gram and attend the regularly sched-
uled classes of the University.
In general, the A.S.T.R.P. have a
schedule far more rigorous than the av-
erage University student. In addition
to attending approximately thirty hours
of classes per weeek, supervised study is
enforced from seven to ten in the eve-
ning. Their education at the Univer-
sity consists mainly of courses in mathe-
matics, physics, chemistry, English, his-
tory, and geography. A strenuous physi-
cal education program is also main-
tained. Military education is, of course,
not neglected, the program being set up
to parallel that of the regular R.O.T.C.
Composed primarily of men from
Wisconsin, Illinois, and Michigan, the
unit is under the jurisdiction of the Sixth
Service Command, whose orders are ad-
ministered by the Army Heado.uarters
on campus.

JOHN LINKER considered high school
a "flop" because all of his time was
spent on study, so when he arrived here
at Michigan in the fall of 1941 he was
all set to participate in extra-curricular
activities. Well, he certainly accom-
plished what he set out to do, for in ad-
dition to being elected to Vulcans in
recognition for his extra-curricular ac-
tivities, John is a member of Phi Eta
Sigma, Tau Beta Pi, Sigma Xi, and Phi
Kappa Phi, which attests to his schol-
astic achievements. He was assistant
editor of the Technic last semester,
chairman of the Honor Council, and
president of the Men's Judiciary Coun-
cil.
His plans for the future are not defi-
nite as yet. However, he will come back
here after the war. A great influence in
this decision is fraternity life which re-
grettably is limited due to the war. John
believes that fraternities are an impor-
tant part of college life and is presi-
dent of Sigma Phi Epsilon. He was init-
iated in January of 1943. He lived in
the house for only one semester as it
was rented to the Army in June. De-
spite frequent bull sessions and trips to

John J. Linker
A liberal engineer
the P-Bell, John had a four point aver-
age that semester, and still does not
know how he did it.
John comes from Glen Rock, New
Jersey, and almost went to Purdue. His
father, however, who is an engineer, and
a friend, who is an alumnus of the
University, convinced him to come here.
He is glad he did and "wouldn"t go any
place else." Like many others his stay
at Michigan has been greatly shortened
due to the war and accelerated courses.
An advocate of a five year engineer-
ing program, he believes this should in-
clude some liberal arts courses in order
to give an engineer a broad background.
Although as a freshman John intended
to study Diesel Engineering he will grad-
uate in October with degrees in Mechan-
ical and Aeronautical Engineering. At
present, in addition to his other extra-
curricular activities, he is getting prac-
tice in engineering as a research assistant
to Professor Schwartz and a student as-
sistant to Professor Lay.
His main forms of recreation are golf,
camping, and hiking. He usually spends
his weekends playing golf, with a date,
or with the boys in his fraternity. John
is a great football enthusiast and enjoys
watching the Wolverines—especially
when they win.
John's ambition is to see the rest of
the country. Here's hoping that he'll
soon be able to do that.
the boss
THIS issue of the Technic is
dedicated to the man responsible
for its publication, our recently ap-
pointed Editor-in-Chief, Frank Arams.
It is therefore fitting that we present
"the Boss."
I doubt if there are many engineers
who do not know Franky. His genial
nature captivates everyone he meets. It
follows that he has made quite a name
for himself on the campus. His achieve-
ments include, in addition to his posi-
tion on the magazine, the presidency of
the Men's Congress, vice-president of
the Engineering Council, a member of
the Honor Committee, a member of the
A.I.E.E. as well as of the electrical en-
gineering honor society, Eta Kapa Nu.
Believing that a man should learn
his business from the ground up, Frank
intends to enter the electrical field in
the sales department of some large cor-
poration, and work up to a position in
electronics research.

Frank R. Arams
"a man should learn his business from
the ground up."
This semester he is actively engaged in
a research project concerning High Fre-
quency Induction Heating. As if that
isn't sufficient, he also finds time to
work for the University Extension Serv-
ice as an Instructor in Mathematics,
Physics, and Radio. This is probably
an unusual record in the history of the
University, but there is still more. The
boss is also an intellectual and a fig-
ure in the social world. He is quite a
mean rug-cutter on the dance floor and
card cutter ofi the table top. In a social-
executive capacity Frank was a member
of the Michigan Union Student Council
and the Slide Rule Ball Committee. He
is also founder and president of the Fri-
day Night Blackjack and Poker Club
Incorporated.
This list of accomplishments probably
conveys the impression that Franky is a
replica of Robert Taylor with the brains
of Albert Einstein and the political
power of F.D.R. This is definitely mis-
leading. In truth, Frank is the spitting
image of his mother, a woman to whom
he is very devoted. He is about five feet
nine inches tall, weighs one hundred
sixty pounds, has curly black hair, and
is 1-A in the draft. This is just about
the description of the average American
boy in the year of 1944.

WASHINGTON—B-29 Superfortress of the USAAF 20th
Bomber Command bombed Japan again today.
Illustrations courtesy BELLRISGER
rT,HE B-29 is a 4-engined all-meti
■*- monoplane with tricycle landin
gear. Even with its great size it has
speed approximately as fast as the new
est and fastest pursuit and fighter plane
in the world today. It is 92 ft. long, 2
ft. high, and boasts a wing span of 141J
ft. Its service altitude is greater thai
that of any other bomber in existence
By shooting more lead concentrate*
more accurately at a more distant targe
than any other plane built, the B-2&lt;
gunfire system enables it to fly througl
swarms of enemy fighters without fightei
escort. In fact, there is no existing
fighter than can approach their range
even with jettison gas tanks.
The Superfortress is powered by four
Wright Cyclone engines of 2200 horse-
power each. The propellers are the
largest in use today—1611&gt; feet in diam-
eter. The lowest ratio reduction gear
ever used on aircraft is employed to
keep the speed of the tip below the
speed of sound. Each of the four 2200
horsepower engines on a superbomber
has two turbo-superchargers to supply it
with sufficient compressed air to main-
tain high power at altitudes of 40.000
feet and higher.
Turbosuperchargers attached to two
of the engines feed compressed air to
the pressure-sealed cabin, a small amount
of air being sufficient to maintain near-
A cloi

cabin at high altitudes. This pressur-
izing of the cabin provides crew mem-
bers of the superbomber free combat ac-
tion at heights where oxygen masks were
previously required. In case a shell
punctures the cabin, and, during a bomb-
ing run as a possible precaution against
interruption, crew members don oxygen
masks. If the cabin remained unscathed
during the action it can be pressurized
in an instant by opening an intake valve
connected to the turbosuperchargers.
The B-29 is self-sufficient both as a
fighter and as a bomber. Its armament
is especially heavy, consisting of power
turrets with multiple gun installations
of .50 caliber guns and 20 mm cannon.
The fire control system includes com-
puting gun sights which automatically
correct for various factors such as the
plane and wind velocity while putting
the sight directly on the target. In a
matter of seconds most of the ship's
armament can be swung around to con-
centrate terrific fire on one spot.
The Superfortress is half again as
large as the Flying Fortress and has
twice its weight. The front-end fusel-
age cabin entails more work to make
than the complete nose and center
fuselage of the B-26. The box in which
it is shipped would make an adequate
garage for an automobile.
-29 Superfortress.
Despite its size, the B-29 is cleaner
areodynamically than the Fortress. Its
retractable landing gear fits into wells
whose doors close flush, for streamlining.
The wings, which carry a greater load
per square foot than any other wing
ever built, have more aerodynamic re-
finement than has ever been achieved in
wings of their size before. The ability
to carry a greater load was brought
about by the introduction of a new air-
foil section (the Boeing 117 wing). A
remarkable set of wing flaps, which
constitute 20% of the wing area, give
the Superfortress short take-off and
landing characteristics.
Precision engineering goes into the
manufacture and assembly of the cowl-
ings, often called the front "collar" of
the engine coverings. These cowlings,
being almost as large as the center sec-
tion of a medium bomber, entail just as
much work to make.
Of course the production details are
still secret, but it can be said that the
present manufacturing program is greater
than any previously attempted in the
history of aviation.


Night and day, workers carry on their jobs of preparing the Super-
fortresses for action.

public health at U of M
THERE is at present a great and
broadening interest in the field of
public health. Men and women are be-
ing trained to devote their lives to the
prevention of diseases. Public Health
will no longer be a sideline, it will take
its place with medicine as a science
by itself. Public health departments
have existed in cities, states, and towns
for years, and have had a great influ-
ence in the preventing and handling of
epidemics. It is for this reason that the
University of Michigan School of Pub-
lic Health was founded in 1941. It is
under the directorship of Dr. Henry F.
Vaughn. The building (see cut) which
was occupied in 1943 boasts labora-
tories and equipment of every kind
necessary to train doctors, nurses, in-
dustrial hygienists, dentists, statisti-
cians, economists, plumbers, policemen,
mayors, and all other technicians and
government officials interested in meth-
ods of disease control. There are only
seven other institutions in the United
States with similar facilities. However,
in most of these public health is merely
a sideline.
The aim of the Michigan School of
Public Health is not merely to further
preventive medicine in the state, but
to help in a world-wide movement which
will take place after the peace. At
present men and women from all parts
of the Western Hemisphere come to the
University for training which they will
utilize in their own countries. Public
Health schools are being established in
various South American countries.
These countries are looking for their
education to the United States, which
has surpassed Europe as a medical
center. Brazil already has a well-
organized school directed by United
States trained personnel.
At the University of Michigan re-
search dealing with a variety of subjects
is underway. Among them are parasitic
disease, virus diseases, principles and
methods of industrial health, public
health nursing in relation to health de-
partments, public health engineering,
and problems associated with public
health dentistry. The educative and re-
search programs at the University of
Michigan related to all phases of pre-
ventive medicine are correlated with
other branches of science on the cam-
pus. Similar efforts in other schools and
in other countries hand in hand with
the efforts of government agencies are
expected to form a great international
organization which will function for the
prevention of diseases in all countries.
The knowledge acquired everywhere
in public health will be scattered
throughout the country. "Public health
must be taught," says Dr. Cumming,
who now directs the effort on the two
American continents, "not only to grad-
uate and undergraduate students but
also to the people in general and very
often the rulers. Professors of hygiene
in Latin-America have done this to an
extent almost unimagined in this coun-
try, becoming pioneers in practically
every sanitary advancement. We antici-
pate a two-way Gulf Stream of knowl-
edge which will warm both our contin-
ents with constant currents of informa-
tion on all phases of science and es-
pecially public health."

New retractable landing gear—Douglas bomber trades wheels for treads.
web feet for war birds
U. S. Army aircraft laboratory engi-
neers at Wright Field, Dayton, Ohio,
have designed this new caterpillar-type
landing gear. Intended for the Doug-
las A-20 "Havoc" fighter bomber, it
permits landings at speeds as high as
120 miles an hour. Its tread uses about
the same amount of rubber as would go
into an airplane tire, but gives this
sturdy Douglas bomber from four to
eight times greater contact area on the
ground. The A-20 can thus make land-
ings on soft, sandy, or even excessively
rough ground.

SCRUBBING STEEL WITH A BRUSH OF FLAMES
JMF SIMPLE process this man is using is called
"flame-priming." It was developed by THE LiNDE Am
PRODUCTS COMPANY.
When the fiery "hristles" of oxy-acetylene flame sweep
over steel, the intense heat causes scale to expand and
pop loose. This heat thoroughly dries the surface and
consumes or neutralizes any oil, rust, and other foreign
matter that may be present.
Applied to steel just before the first coat of paint is
put on, "flame-priming" makes paint go further and
last longer, and makes painting a more permanent means
of preventing corrosion.
Oxygen, acetylene, and many machines and tech-
niques for treating, cutting, and fabricating metals have
been made available to industry for years by LiNDE and
other Units of UCC.
FLAME-PRIMING is used on..

Above: A 50,000-watt amplifier installed for FM station WCFM, Schenectady.
Shown arc part of the transmitter, and the operating console, monitoring and
control equipment of that station.
Right: A lightning bolt of 1,000,000 volts was released a few feet away from
this FM radio receiver, yet people visiting the New York World's Fair in
1939-40 were amazed—not a crackle of static was heard in the set!

Likewise, FM receivers work very poorly
on AM stations. To overcome this dif-
ficulty, manufacturers are producing
two-in-one sets, where the change from
FM to AM circuits is made by merely
snapping a switch. These combination
sets may soon be as popular as AM sets
have been in the past.
about the old
university station
In February, 1924, the Department
of Electrical Engineering began to op-
erate an AM station with the call let-
ters WCBC. The station was located in
room 103, West Engineering Building,
and the antenna extended from there
over the top of the building and then
200 feet north to the brick chimney,
which was at that time 150 feet tall.
The station was constructed by two stu-
dents, Louis Dorff and L. N. Holland,
under the supervision of Prof. E. E.
Dreese, who is now Chairman of the
Department of Electrical Engineering
at Ohio State University. It was first
operated on a frequency of 1070 kilo-
cycles, and later on 1310 kilocycles.
Operation was discontinued in June of
the same year for financial reasons.
Although they cannot be classed as
broadcasting stations, we might mention,
in passing, the Electrical Engineering
Department station W8XA and the am-
ateur radio station W8AXZ, operated
jointly by the Signal Corps unit of the
University R.O.T.C. and the Depart-
ment of Electrical Engineering. During
the past 30 years these stations have
exchanged messages directly with al-
most every country in the world, and at
one time W8AXZ was instrumental in
establishing direct communication be-
tween the Byrd Antartic Expedition and
the University of Michigan Greenland
Expedition at opposite ends of the earth.
Because of the present international sit-
uation, however, W8AXZ is temporarily
inoperative. The equipment, now partly
dismantled in accordance with the law,
is located in room 1S6-C West Engi-
neering Building.
the University FM station
Applications have been submitted to
the Federal Communications Commis-
sion, and this body will presumably issue
a license as soon as the War Production
board will release the necessary equip-
ment.
The station will probably be found
somewhere in the band between 42 and
43 megacycles (about 7 meters) on your
dial. This band has been set aside by
the Federal Communications Commis-
sion for educational purposes.
Application has been made for 50,000
watts, or about the same strength as sta-
tion WJR.
By careful design and placement of
the transmitting antenna and the use of
a large amount of power, it is hoped that
the signal of the University station will
be picked up satisfactorily as far away
as 80 miles by ordinary home receivers,
and 120 miles by the special receivers
used for re-broadcasting. This distance
seems rather short in comparison with
distances covered by present day AM
stations, and so perhaps an explanation
is in order.
As mentioned before, the wave length
of the radio waves emanating from the
antenna of the new transmitter will be
only about seven meters. The shorter
any radio waves are made, the more
nearly they behave like light waves,
and the less they deviate from straight
line paths of travel. At seven meters,
the waves have difficulty in bending
enough to follow even the slight curva-
ture of the earth's surface, except under
special atmospheric conditions.
If we find the maximum distance be-
tween two locations from which two ob-

maximum distance between the two ob-
servers depends upon their heights above
ground, and, for a perfectly smooth
spherical earth, is given approximately
by the formula
5
d (VK+ Vh2)
4
where d is in miles, and the heights of
the two observers, hx and ho, are in feet.
If one observer is 500 feet above ground
and the other 50 feet, a sample calcula-
tion gives d = 3 7 miles.
Incidentally, one advantage of the
shorter wavelengths is that by use of
relatively simple techniques it is possi-
ble to concentrate a large portion of the
radiated energy into the horizontal
plane, thus increasing the signal-to-noise
ratio over the coverage area of the sta-
tion, and thereby making the station
more effective everywhere within that
area. However, this does not result in ex-
tending the boundaries of the region by
any appreciable amount.
The main studios will probably be lo-
cated on the top floor of the new Service
Building, which will occupy the present
sites of Morris Hall and Staebler's Filling
Station, thus closing off Jefferson Street.
The transmitter location has not been
definitely fixed, but there are two large
hills a mile or two apart just south of
Portage and Base Lakes, respectively,
which are under consideration. These
hills are about twelve or thirteen miles
northwest of the campus.
As to what kind of programs will be
offered it is yet too early to give a defi-
nite answer to this question. As I per-
sonally have no responsibilities in con-
nection with the programs, I can, of
course, make no definite commitments
on behalf of the managing personnel. I
do know that one of the things hoped
for in the post-war era is a state-wide
network of stations to be used for educa-
tional purposes, of which this might
very well be the key station. A program
of adult education under the Extension
Department will be an important part
of the work. Also, it is safe to assume
that the station will be used part of the
time by the speech department in much
the same way as the Morris Hall studios
are used at present, and that the authori-
tative talks on the various subjects of

tion. Today, total-flooding and bilge-
flooding systems are used to safeguard
cargo holds, storage spaces, engine
rooms, engine room bilges, fuel tanks,
paint lockers and electrical equipment.
The installation of combined smoke
detecting and carbon dioxide fire extin-
guishing systems is now standard ma-
rine practice. A smoke detecting cabi-
net, located in the wheelhouse, is con-
nected by piping with each protected
space. In C-O-Two cabinets, the piping
terminates in individual observation
windows, each numbered to correspond
with the space under protection. A
blower motor draws air continuously
from the protected spaces through the
piping into the cabinet. A trace of
smoke in any of the protected spaces
immediately becomes visible in the ob-
servation window for that space, thus
indicating the location of the fire. Turn-
ing a two-way control valve in the pipe
line at a control valve cabinet closes
the line from the control valve cabinet
to the smoke detecting cabinet and
leaves the line open to the hold or space
on fire. Carbon dioxide to extinguish
the fire is then discharged into the af-
fected hold through the same pipe used
for smoke detecting.
Audible and visual smoke detection
cabinets are equipped with photocell de-
vices which automatically sound a
howler alarm and light a red signal
lamp in the cabinet whenever smoke ap-
pears in the air stream from a protected
space.
On oil tankers, the main fire hazard
exists when the cargo tank hatches are
open. To provide the necessary protec-


Hand portables are used to protect small electrical installations. Here, workers at
Wright Aeronautical Corporation are being shown that carbon dioxide may be used
safely on live electrical equipment.
A marine smoke-detecting cabinet. Any
trace of smoke in a protected space is

tion, two or more nozzles, connected by
piping to a battery of carbon dioxide
cylinders, are installed in each hatch
opening. When gas is discharged through
these nozzles, it forms a screen that pre-
vents air from entering the hatch and
smothers fire in a few seconds.
The carbon dioxide cylinders form-
ing the main battery for protecting a
cargo vessel or tanker are manifolded
together and are securely bracketed in a
space provided for them, usually called
the "CO 2 room." One or more control
stations are provided, at each end of
which there are valves for directing the
discharge of carbon dioxide to the de-
sired point and pull-boxes for releasing
the gas from as many cylinders as may
be required for the job in hand.
One important contribution to multi-
ple cylinder systems is the development
by C-O-Two engineers of a pressure-
operated valve which utilizes the tre-
mendous presure of carbon dioxide
stored within its own cylinder. Prior to
this development, it was necessary to
operate the valve of each cylinder of a
system, in order to discharge the entire
battery. With "pressure-operated" valves
a single operation opens the valves of
two control cylinders and the pressure
of the discharging gas from these initi-
ally released cylinders simultaneously
discharges all cylinders of the battery or
groups that may be manifolded together
for group discharge.
A significant trend in the develop-
ment of high pressure carbon dioxide
fire-extinguishing equipment is its use
for protecting hazards of ever increasing
magnitude. The present farthest ad-
vance in this direction is represented by
a recently installed system employing
273 100-pound cylinders—more than
13J/2 tons—of carbon dioxide for the
total flooding of three areas at the Pine
Bluff Arsenal, Ark., where processes of
an especial hazardous nature are being
carried on.
This installation also illustrates the
operation performed by a modern total-
flooding system.
When fire breaks out in any of the
protected areas, pulling the handle of a
cable pull-box discharges the control
cylinders of the battery and the gas
pressure from the control cylinders dis-
charges the other cylinders of the bat-
tery, but the gas is not immediately re-
leased.

bon dioxide pressure, warns workers :n
the space to leave at once; carbon di-
oxide pressure-operated explosion-proof
switches stop all electrically-operated
equipment in the space and light a red
signal lamp in the supervisor's office.
After a delay of thirty seconds, which
gives the workers time to vacate the
space, a normally closed valve in the
carbon dioxide discharge pipe is opened
by a time-delay release, also operated
by carbon dioxide presure. Then the
doors and other openings into the space
are closed by carbon dioxide pressure-
operated trips and the gas is discharged
into the space.
As the fire is instantly extinguished,
without damage to equipment or resi-
due to be removed, operations can be
resumed as soon as the space has been
ventilated.
In the aviation field, a recent develop-
ment by C-O-Two Company engineers
is a smoke detector for cargo spaces. It
consists of a small cabinet that may be
located inside or outside the protected
space. Photocells in the cabinet are ex-
posed to a beam of light from an ex-
citer lamp. Air from the protected space
passes continuously through the cabinet,
and if it contains a trace of smoke, a
sensitive relay is actuated, which closes
a circuit lighting a red lamp on the
pilot's instrument panel and sounds a
howler alarm in the cockpit. The pilot
then extinguishes the fire.
Two photo cells are used in this de-
tector, No. 1 cell for generating current
due to stray light and No. 2 for bucking
or balancing such current. The cells
are coupled opposed and are so con-
nected to the terminals of the sensitrol
relay. When both cells generate the
same amount of current, the sensitrol
relay balances at zero. However, when
smoke is present in the light beam di-
rectly in front of No. 1 cell, the latter
generates five or more microamperes
which is sufficient to unbalance the cir-
cuit and cause the relay needle to swing
and make contact. This closes a battery
circuit through the windings of the
power relay.
Carbon dioxide is also used to prevent
tracer bullets from setting fire to the
fuel tanks of airplanes by flooding the
spaces inside and immediately around

Spray booths are commonly protected
by single cylinder built-in systems.
the tanks with the gas to provide an
inert atmosphere.
Equally important from the stand-
point of the safety of an airplane crew
forced down at sea is the use of carbon
dioxide for inflating rubber boats and
life rafts. Carbon dioxide, as supplied
for fire extinguishment, is useful for
this purpose because, when released
from its container, it expands to about
450 times its original volume, a far
greater expansion than can be obtained
with air under the highest practicable
pressure. A special type of valve, known
as the "Flip" type because it can be
opened with the flip of a finger, has
been developed by C-O-Two engineers
for the small cylinder of carbon dioxide
used in this application.
In the automotive field, large num-
bers of portable carbon dioxide extin-
guishers are being used by the Army
and Navy for protecting trucks, tanks,
trailers and other military vehicles.
Tanks are further safeguarded by man-
ually operated built-in systems for
flooding the engine compartments in
event of fire.
The use of carbon dioxide to prevent
fires and explosions by providing an in-
ert atmosphere is one of the applica-
tions which promises to increase stead-
ily.
The University FM Station
(continued from page 24)
general public interest will be continued,
as well as other public service programs.
It is possible, although no one has in-
dicated the probability of its happening,
that some of the musical programs at
Hill Auditorium may be broadcast. A
precedent has been established for this,
incidentally, more than twenty years
ago. Other musical programs might also
be broadcast, and the station, in con-
junction with the School of Music,
might build a complete library of re-
corded music, both for public consump-
tion and for educational purposes.
Broadcasts of University sports e%rents
can easily become an important part of
the program schedule, especially if the
services of good sports announcers can
be obtained.
Special programs for local student
consumption could be broadcast during
certain odd hours, also, with the station
operating on reduced power.
No matter how these details work out,
there is no doubt that the University's
FM station can render a great public
service.

TWO days after the men finished
ramming in the bottom of this
new 35-ton electric melting fur-
nace, it was in full operation on
special alloy steels for the war
assembly lines.
1 Allegheny Ludlum plant capacity
has been expanded at record pace.
Our output of stainless, electrical,
tool, and aircraft engine valve steels
has been multiplied again and
again. Production will continue to
increase, because the appetite of
war is insatiable—particularly in
this and the coming year, with the
effort of the Allied Nations trans-
formed from defense to the attack.
We have been in the fight from
the beginning, and will remain
until the close. Then, after peace
has been regained, we can apply
the additional knowledge and ca-
pacity accumulated during the war
years to the enrichment of your
personal life. Allegheny Metal, and
our other alloy steel products, will
return to their familiar everyday
uses and to your homes.
Meanwhile, the appetite of war
is also insatiable for many things
with which you can help, directly
and immediately. Collect scrap
metal and paper; keep expenditures
as low as possible; conserve food,
heating fuel, gasoline and rubber.
Above all, buy every last War Bond

G. I. REFLECTIONS
Editor's Note:
When we asked aero engine stu-
dent Alan Pasch to write his regular
column, namely "The Technic Re-
flects," which he had been writing for
more than a year, we jound that gag-
writer Pasch was now Private Pasch,
USA. Unperturbed, Al wrote back
from Aberdeen Proving Ground,
Maryland, enclosing what follows be-
low and sounding a more serious note.
IT IS now summer in Ann Arbor
and, from latest reports, in sundry
other places too. And once more the
Technic comes forth to brighten an
otherwise dull season at Michigan.
For various reasons, it seems pecul-
iar, to say the least (and we gen-
erally do), to be sitting down once
more for the purpose of grinding out

another edition of Ye Olde Reflects.
In the first place, the setting is some-
what altered—instead of the accus-
tomed hideout in East Engine (you
know the best mag of all is in East
Engine Hall) with its empty beer
bottles, cigarette butts, and last
month's copies all over the floor, its
clicking typewriters, and bevy of
beautiful female engineering students
—we are sitting in a large room, in
which several intelligent looking men
clothed amazingly alike are studi-
ously perusing copies of Gags, Pic,
and Dick Tracy. This is the Com-
pany Day Room of a basic training
regiment in a large Army Camp in
the East.
Secondly, it becomes necessary, of
a sudden, to raise our company
above the level to which it has been
accustomed—the level mentioned in
the last paragraph. Thirdly, we are
attempting to write an article for
Michiganders, about Michigan, with-
out having been anywhere near the
place for months. This presents a
seemingly difficult problem, but, on
second thought, we never did write
about Michigan, and we're beginning
to wonder if anyone ever read the
stuff anyhow.
This does serve to bolster our
morale (or remaining remnants there-
of) however, and we are now won-
dering what gives in double—A. We
wonder among other things, how the
P-Bell beer is faring (this does not
constitute an endorsement of P-Bell
beer by the Army, as the Army does
not endorse any particular brand of
beer), how Michigan women are
looking (this does not constitute an
endorsement of Michigan women by
the Army, as the Army does not
endorse any particular brand of
women), and whether Ann Arbor
is as hot and humid as Maryland
weather (this does not constitute an
endorsement of Michigan or Mary-
land weather, as we have seen them
both, and we'll be damned if we'll
endorse any weather such is found
in either of said localities.)

Incidentally, speaking of morale,
lest anyone think that the oft-re-
peated pleas of the USO and other
organizations to write letters, letters
and more letters to the boys and girls
in the service is just silly affecta-
tions of patriotism for the sake of
publicity, let us hasten to assure
them that, short of going home, let-
ters contribute more than anything
else towards making a serviceman's
life more bearable. For whether a
man is in a foxhole in Burma, a
landing craft in Normandy, a tank
in Italy, or a camp in the United
States, he is being subjected to an
entirely new and much harder way
of living and take it from us, it's not
easy.

TRADITIONALLY a welder is sur-
rounded by the haze of smoke.
Now a portable Precipitron*, the

smoke. The unit clears 600 cubic
feet of air per minute.
COUNTING THUNDERBOLTS is the
task of a new device which has
been thrown into the campaign to
protect power lines from damage
by lightning. It consists of a saw-
toothed and a straight-edged strip
of metal foil between two layers of
transparent plastic, and is about
the size of a playing card. When
lightning strikes a power line, a bit
of the lightning is deflected to the
foil, jumps the gap from one tooth
to the straight-edge. In so doing it
scorches a black spot on the plastic
and also burns away that saw-
tooth, so that the next discharge
must travel by another path. No
two teeth are the same size; each
discharge picks the shortest path
and thus is registered only once.
ARCHERY AND ELECTRONS are work-
ing together in that most modern
of scientific instruments, the elec-
tron microscope. Quartz filaments
1/30,000 of an inch in diameter—
one-sixteenth the thickness of a
human hair—are used to calibrate
the magnifying power of these
microscopes. Westinghouse engi-
neers have found that a modifica-
tion of the medieval cross-bow is
the simplest and most efficient de-
vice for drawing out molten quartz
into such a filament before it can
cool or harden.

neering. Ask for booklet UMT 84.

Surgery by triangulation
The life of a soldier wounded by a bullet or shell fragment may depend
on the speed with which the metal can be located and removed.
Today, in army field hospitals, only one minute is required to dis-
cover the fragment and locate it in two planes, incidentally giving the
surgeon two points at which incision may be made and also the correct
angles and depths beneath the skin.
This is made possible by the Westinghouse Bi-Plane Marker, a device
which translates the conditions shown by the fluoroscope into "guide
posts" for the surgeon's knife.
Used with the Bi-Plane Marker is the Re-orientating Device, which
makes certain that the position of the patient on the operating table is
exactly the same as during the fluoroscopic examination.
Bi-Plane Marker and Re-orientating Device were designed by West-
inghouse x-ray engineers to meet requirements outlined by Colonel
Alfred A. de Lorimier, Commandant of the Army School of Roentgen-
ology, Memphis, Tennessee.

Out of World War II is swiftly advancing a new era in metals—the age of "super-
hardness". New, far-reaching uses of cemented carbide, the hardest metal made by
man, are steadily providing industry with strategic "weapons"—developed on the
tough proving grounds of war production—that will help build new and better things,
at less cost, for the world of tomorrow.
Already industry has crossed far beyond the threshold of this new era in metal "super-
hardness". Today cemented carbide cuts a large percentage of all metal "machined"
in industry; "draws" the bulk of the footage of wire produced; fabricates millions of sheet
metal parts; and is steadily advancing into new fields of use as "wear-proofed" parts
for countless machines and products in common use. Already, this age of "super-hard-
ness"—has profoundly affected the speed of output, the cosr and the quality of virtually
the entire range of metal products.
"Super-hardness"—Carboloy Cemented Carbide hardness—so vital to war, fore-
casts an era of major industrial advances in the days of peace to come.

Most laboratories at the University of Michigan employ many pieces of apparatus
which are mainly electrical in character. Electrical Engineering is one of the basic
fields of engineering practice. Electrical machinery in use throughout this university
and industry is convenient for making many common observations. Much electrical
equipment owes its accuracy to the unmatched speed of electricity. For instance, the
electrical stroboscope can simplify the study of many important motions. In the

AUTOMATIC PILOT
FLYING blind most of the time, a pilot has a hard job keeping his plane on its course. An auto-
matic pilot, electrically-driven, allows him to relax occasionally ... to save his physical and
mental resources for the job that may, and often does, lie far ahead.
An electric motor spins 12,000 revolutions per minute to keep the gyroscopic mechanism, guiding
power of the automatic pilot, rotating at constant speed. The unit is tightly sealed to insure constant
speed of rotation even when the air outside contains many dust particles, or its temperature is very low.
The automatic pilot is able to take over the controls and hold the plane on a predetermined course.
Any pitch, roll, or yaw—that is, lengthwise or crosswise tilt or turn of the plane -produces an electric
signal in the G-E automatic pilot. This signal is amplified and converted into hydraulic power which
moves elevators, ailerons, and the rudder to bring the plane back to its correct position.

FLYING SVITS
WHEN planes land in unpopulated regions, or when
fliers have to bail out in the middle of nowhere,
there is comfort to a General Electric flying suit. Even
when not plugged in, the suits can take rugged terrain,
strenuous action, and cold weather.
A short time ago some G-E engineers spent two days
and nights in the suits on Mt. Cranmore and Mt.
Washington in New Hampshire. They skied, hiked,
blazed trails, and camped out in heavy snowdrifts at
temperatures close to zero.
After the ordeal, men and suits were doing nicely.
The men had kept warm; the suits had withstood the
wear; and the electric circuits built into the clothing
operated perfectly when they were plugged in.
SPttV DRYING
DRYING time has been cut from six hours to 27
minutes on airplane instrument cases by using the
new General Electric infrared Drying Lamps. These lamps
are one of the important "little things" that G.E. is
manufacturing to speed things up on the production
front.
These lamps are being used in many war industries to
dry everything from paint on tanks and jeeps to pho-
tographic film and the glue on envelope flaps. In addition,
some are designed for roving jobs such as drying out
important equipment after it has been drenched by
floods. Equipment speedily dried is frequently salvaged
with little loss. General Electric Company, Schenectady,
