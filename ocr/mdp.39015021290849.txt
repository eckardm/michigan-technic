Steel guinea pig about to have a breakdown
• We've come a long way toward licking the No. 1
enemy of steel—corrosion.
At United States Steel, for example, we've learned
a lot through exposure tests, equipment service
trials, accelerated laboratory tests, and the like.
But there's just one way to be sure which grade
of steel will give the longest service per dollar of
cost on any given job: try it under actual operating
conditions.
That's where the steel "guinea pigs" come in.
Those expendable corrosion test racks are made up
from a dozen or more different grades of steel
separated by porcelain insulators that prevent gal-
vanic action. We actually put the "guinea pigs"
right into the operating equipment that contains
corrosive liquids or gases. Then, when the steel
specimens have been exposed to the service
conditions for predetermined periods of
time, we remove the guinea pigs, send
them to the laboratory and determine the
©
most economical steel for that particular service.
To our way of thinking, this is the most accurate
way to decide what grade of steel is the best buy
for a particular installation.
Actual on-the-job corrosion tests like these have
saved many thousands of dollars for refineries, tex-
tile and paper mills, food processing plants and
other manufacturers to whom corrosion is an ex-
pensive headache. For these users, the cost of
steel replacement has been lowered; and our cus-
tomers have had fewer hours of lost production
time due to corrosive failure.
This guinea pig test is typical of the many and
varied research projects sponsored by United States
Steel. Trained metallurgists in the field and in doz-
ens of research laboratories are working to develop
new steel compositions, and to solve prob-
lems involving the more efficient use of
steel. United States Steel Company, 525

Creation of a new staff function to pro-
mote and coordinate an expanded em-
ployee communication program was an-
nounced today by Esso Standard Oil Com-
pany.
Designated as the Information Division
of the Employee Relations Department,
the group will be responsible for estab-
lishing through line managements more
effective communication among manage-
ment, unions, supervisors and employees.
Headed by Harry D. Kolb, formerly
assistant manager of the Training Divi-
sion, the group will aid in the develop-
ment of media and materials for internal
distribution, programs for employee meet-
ings and forums and provide news service
and assistance to company publications.
It will also conduct research in the field
of employee communication and assist
headquarters and field officers in the de-
velopment of communication programs.

Harry D. Kolb
Behind the move, William Nadcn,
vice-president and contact director for
Employee Relations pointed out, is a
recognition "that the individual employee
has enlarged his influence in industrial
and political actions. In industry he makes
his decisions whether to support or reject,
commend or condone actions by his com-
pany, his union or his supervisor. It is
more important now than ever that his
company share information with him.
Only thus can he get the necessary facts
and viewpoints. On the effectiveness of
this exchange rests the soundness of his
decisions."
Mr. Kolb joined the company in 1934
in the sales engineering department and
subsequently served as editor of its tech-
nical publications. During World War
II, he served as assistant chief of training
for the U. S. Air Force's civilian staffs in
this country. He subsequently headed the
AAF School for Personnel Management
in Orlando, Florida for which he was
awarded the Legion of Merit. He held
the rank of lieutenant colonel.
Mr. Kolb is a graduate of Carnegie
Institute of Technology and took a mas-
ter's degree in aeronautical engineering
at the University of Michigan. He
makes his home in Garden City, New
York.

How chemical research in petroleum
yielded benefits far a-field
/""\ne of the processes on which
^-^ Standard Oil has done important
development work is the Oxo process,
which converts olefins to aldehydes
and alcohols by high-pressure reaction
with a mixture of hydrogen and car-
bon monoxide.
Today Standard Oil is constructing
an Oxo plant for the large-scale pro-
duction of iso-octyl alcohol. Its ca-
pacity will be ten million pounds a
year. Other alcohols could be pro-
duced here with only minor changes.
Iso-octyl alcohol is used to make
phthalic and adipic esters. These are
plasticizers for vinyl plastics, found
in a wide variety of products ranging
from toys to life rafts. Iso-octyl alco-
hol is also useful as a base for making
lube additives, anti-foam agents, and
other important products.
Research on the Oxo process con-
tinues in our Whiting laboratories
with a view toward improving plant
operation and finding other applica-
tions for the process.
The Oxo process is just one of a
wide variety of subjects under study
at Whiting by young men with train-
ing in engineering and chemistry.

PAUL W. THOMPSON
Paul W. Thompson, Vice President in
charge of Engineering of the Detroit Edi-
son Company, was born December 7,
1887, in Oxford, New York. He at-
tended Oxford Academy and graduated
from Cornell University in 1910 with a
degree in mechanical engineering. From
1910 to 1913 he was an instructor in
senior engineering subjects at Cornell
University. He was employed by Detroit
Edison in 1913 as experimental engineer
at the Delray Power Plant. Since that
time he has held the positions of Techni-
cal Engineer of Power Plants, Chief Engi-
neer of Power Plants, and in September,
1943, was elected Vice President in
charge of Engineering of The Detroit
Edison Company.
During the first World War he served
progressively as First Lieutenant, Captain,
and Major with the United States Army
Ordnance Department, and was in charge
of inspection of material manufactured in
the Cleveland area. He also served as
United States Army representative on the
Cleveland District Ordnance Claims
Board.
Mr. Thompson has taken an active part
in technical society committee work and
various civic activities. During World
War II, Mr. Thompson served as coordi-
nator of the Detroit area for the Na-
tional Fuel Efficiency Program, and
handled special assignments with the Na-
tional Defense Research Committee with
the Office of Scientific Research and De-
velopment.
He has been the author of a number
of miscellaneous engineering articles pub-
lished in the technical press, and has pre-
sented several papers at the American
Society of Mechanical Engineers' annual
meetings.
In 1910, when my professional life
began, the electric power industry was
still a fledgling. Today it stands high in
comparison with many industries of our
country.
The birth of the industry occurred but
68 years ago, when Thomas A. Edison's
work with electricity and his invention of
the incandescent lamp resulted in the
establishment of the Pearl Street Station
in New York City. In the short space of
Paul W. Thompson
a man's lifetime, the electric industry has
advanced amazingly from that beginning
and is now a cornerstone of our modern
civilization, providing an essential service
to every segment of American life. Our
unparalleled standard of living, our abil-
ity to produce goods, and our high hopes
for even greater progress in the future
depend in no small way on the use of
electrical energy.
There are 300,000 employees working
in the investor-owned electric companies
that operate 80 percent of the installed
capacity in the United States. It has taken
17 billion dollars—over $50,000 per em-
ployee—to provide the plant used by
them for the production, transmission and
distribution of electric energy.
A list of stockholders would have
the names of 3 million people from
every walk of life who have pooled their
savings to make this business possible.
There is also an unknown number of
people who have provided capital through
the purchase of bonds. In addition, an
estimated 100,000,000 people who as life
insurance policyholders or depositors in
mutual savings banks have an indirect
financial interest through the holding of
investments by their respective institu-
tions.
This 17 billion dollars of investment
is 39 percent of the amount invested in
manufacturing plants of all kinds thrown
together. It is four times that invested
in primary iron and steel production
plants—and eight times that in automo-
bile and parts manufacturing.
While the product measured at a cus-
tomer's meter is energy in the form of
kilowatt hours, we utility employers are
continually aware that what we really sell
is "service." The customer thinks of elec-
tricity in terms of the things it does for
him. He judges its quality in terms of
continuity and reliability of service, and
of good voltage regulation.
An interesting thing about a kilowatt
hour that is an advantage over the usual
manufactured product is that its design
doesn't change. Production facilities do
not, therefore, suffer the rapid obsoles-
cence of plant resulting from such
change.
The following table gives several na-
tional statistics for the years 1920 and
1950 that show the developments during
that period:
1920 1950
Energy in kilowatt hours pro-
duced per capita 500 2500
Average kilowatt hours used
by a residential customer .. 350 1830
Power assisting each produc-
tion worker in horsepower 1.3 8
Energy assisting each produc-
tion worker in kilowatt
hours 3000 13000
Standard work week in hours 60 40
Percentages of farms electri-
fied 4% 90%
Engineers have developed many new
uses for electric energy, making it pos-
sible to do many jobs today that could
not be done in 1920 or to do them much
more economically than they were being
done by other methods. The 13,000 kilo-
watt hours energy per year for each pro-
duction worker is equivalent to the physi-
cal efforts of 75 to 200 men (depending
on method of calculations) working 40-
hour weeks for one year. But the cost of
electricity used for manufacturing ac-
counts for only % of 1 percent of the
selling price of the factory products.
Had anyone told me forty years ago
that the industry would grow as it has I
would not have believed him. But I have
seen it and have personally experienced

THE RICHEST HILL ON EARTH
BUTTE, MONTANA
BY
CHARLES H. HEWITT, Grad.
Although this article concerns the
famed copper mining district at Butte,
Montana, the geologic processes de-
scribed are equally applicable to many
other metalliferous deposits of the "filled
fissure" type.
The copper-mining district at Butte lies
in southwestern Montana on a western
spur of the continental divide. Hardly
more than 2 by 4 miles in area, this dis-
trict has produced since 1871 over $2.5
billion worth of copper plus considerable-
amounts of gold, silver, lead, zinc, and
manganese.
Beneath the streets of this city of ap-
proximately 40,000 people extend 2200
miles of mine levels and 5200 miles of
stope workings to a depth of 4600 feet.
Normal operations include 8000 em-
ployees working a score of mines. Butte
is called the richest hill on earth and its
production of mineral wealth is exceeded
only by the Witwatersrand gold deposits
near Johannesburg, South Africa.
Mining began in 1864 in Butte when
placer gold was first washed from the
beds of creeks draining the Hill. About
$1,500,000 in gold is estimated to have
been recovered within the first three years.
In 1865 the first shaft was sunk into cop-
per ore. Many mining and smelting com-
panies were organized; and bonanza after
bonanza of gold, silver, and copper was
Charles H. Hewitt
exploited with enormous profit. In 1910
several independent companies consoli-
dated to form the Anaconda Copper Min-
ing Company. By 1928 the Anaconda
Company had purchased all other mining
interests and today it is the sole operator
on the Butte Hill.
The major events in geologic history
leading to the formation of the Butte
district ore deposits began during Middle
Cretaceous time—about 70,000,000 years
ago—when major earth adjustments oc-
curred. The diagrams in Figure 2 show
the major geological events. During Mid-
dle Cretaceous time, normal sedimenta-
tion in a deep sea which covered the en-
tire area of Montana caused the deposi-
tion of the "Colorado" shale (A-Fig. 2).
Subsequent uplift and folding exposed
this shale to erosion (B-Fig. 2). Uplift
and erosion continued into Upper Cre-
taceous time when lavas intruded the
sediments south of Butte and flowed east-
ward into the Cretaceous sea. Some minor
mineralizing activity followed the lava
intrusion (C-Fig. 2).
As the mountain building continued,
folding became so intense that the sedi-
ments ruptured and extensive overthrust
faulting occurred (D-Fig. 2). One of the
largest faults in the world, the Lewis
Overthrust, was formed during Cretace-
ous time. It has a maximum displacement
of 15 miles and extends from the Cana-
dian Rockies to central Montana where it
branches and continues southward. Rocks
formed 900,000,000 years ago were
thrust over rocks formed a mere
70,000,000 years ago.
Near the end of Cretaceous time a
great volume of molten granitic material
—now known as the Boulder Batholith—
14

was intruded into the overlying sediments
and lavas (E-Fig. 2). The present ex-
posed area of the Boulder Batholith is
about 25 miles by 75 miles. Numerous
satellites of similar igneous rock surround
the batholith within 70 miles of its
boundaries. In the terminology of a
foundryman, these satellites may be com-
pared to "risers" which allowed the es-
cape of surplus molten material from the
main body. Geologists call them cupolas.
If erosion had cut another few thousand
feet into the batholith, it would be ex-
posed as a single body with a surface
area several times larger than the present
exposure.
This molten mass of magma ascended
from deep within the earth. As the slag-
like mass worked its way toward the sur-
face, it domed the sediments above and
absorbed great chunks of the overlying
rock. This process is known as magmatic
stoping. Upon cooling, the upper crust
of the magma solidified and the lower
residual liquid became segregated into
two phases—one light colored or acidic
and the other dark colored or basic. These
two phases were intruded into shrinkage
cracks in the upper frozen crust and are
known today as aplite and quartz por-
phyry dikes.
After the intrusion of the Boulder
Batholith, uplift, faulting and erosion
continued over the Rocky Mountain area
into Tertiary time. A large area of the
batholith (including the veins at Butte)
was eroded and exposed as we see it to-
day (F-Fig. 2). During this time lavas
again spread across parts of Montana.
The lavas and hot springs activity at Yel-
lowstone Park are of this age.
It is a well-known physical fact that as
a melt solidifies it crystallizes and expells
gases. In a magma or natural melt, the
gases and vapors contain some of the
rarer constituents such as gold, silver,
copper, lead, or zinc either in solution or
as a sludge. As the expelled gas ascend-
ed fissures and encountered suitable phys-
ical and chemical conditions, it deposited
some of its load. Final cooling of the
melt caused complete crystallization. The
typical Butte "granite" is known as quartz
monzonite and consists primarily of vitri-
ous quartz (Si02), light colored feldspars
(potassium and sodium aluminum sili-
cates), and dark crystalls of biotite mica
and hornblende (hydrated potassium,
magnesium, iron, and aluminum sili-
cates). The texture of this igneous rock
depends on the different rate of cooling
in different portions of the melt. At
Butte, as at other mineralized locations
throughout the Boulder Batholith, the
most intense mineralization is found in
close proximity to the quartz porphyry
dikes.
Obviously, where the more intense
fracturing occurred, the largest veins are
found. At Butte three main fissure sys-
tems are commonly distinguished. They
are described according to their trend or
strike—east-west, northwest, and north-
east; they are named the Anaconda, Blue,
and Stewart-Rarus fissure systems. The
three systems were formed in the order
named, and each one cuts and displaces
the earlier ones, but all mineralization oc-
curred during a relatively short portion
of early Tertiary time. The process was
probably one of continuous infiltration
of mineralizing solutions through dif-
ferent channels which opened or closed
to relieve earth stresses.
Although the Butte veins show remark-
able continuity, only certain portions,
known as ore shoots, contain workable
ore deposits. Quartz and iron pyrite are
the most common minerals found in the
barren portions of the veins. Consider-
able amounts of copper, zinc, manganese,
arsenic, lead, silver, and gold have been
recovered. Other metals known to occur
are iron, tin, tungsten, molybdenum, bis-
muth, antimony, tellurium, selenium,
cadmium, and platinum. Recently, com-
plex radioactive minerals have been re-
ported. Most of the metals are found as
simple or complex sulfides. Manganese
occurs as the carbonate (rhodochrosite)
and gold and silver as native metals.
The mineralogy of the ores is general-
ly quite complex. A zonal arrangement
of minerals is apparent both in plan (Fig.
3) and in section. Each zone is approxi-
mately half a mile in width at the sur-
face. Mr. Reno Sales, Anaconda Com-

Sunspot having two main umbra and several smaller ones. The length of the spot is 51,000 miles. There are some smaller
spots near the upper right corner.
One of the most intriguing phenom-
ena in the study of astronomy is the
problem of sunspots. First discovered by
Galileo with his crude telescope, sun-
spots have been studied for three hundred
years, have had numerous theories pro-
pounded on their origin, but are still
among the unexplained. It was through
Galileo's observations of these dark
patches on the bright solar disc that
Sun's rotation was first observed. Astron-
omers of that time, hearing about the
sunspots, thought them to be planets or
asteroids between the Earth and the Sun;
however, Galileo, after extensive obser-
vation, believed otherwise. In his words:
"Repeated observations have finally con-
vinced me that these spots are substances
on the surface of the solar body where
they are continuously produced and
where they are also dissolved, some in
shorter and others in longer periods. And
by the rotation of the Sun, which com-
pletes its period in about a lunar month,
they are carried around the Sun; an
important occurrence in itself and still
more so for its implications."
Sunspots are temporary phcmonena,
some remaining visible for days or weeks
and occasionally even months. Few of
them last long enough to be brought into
view twice by the Sun's rotation. Through
a telescope the spots are shown as having
a dark central core, or umbra, and a less
dark surrounding area, or penumbra. The
edges of the penumbra are roughly par-
allel to the edges of the umbra, but in
some places the filaments of the penum-
bra stretch out around the spot in irreg-
ular shapes. The spots may occur singly
or in groups having, usually, two main
umbra and many smaller spots or "pores."
Large sunspots may have diameters up to
20,000 miles or more, while large dou-
bles or groups may be 100,000 miles or
more in diameter. Spots having a diam-
eter of 25,000 miles are easily seen by
the naked eye.
Sunspots are variable in number and
intensity. Records of these variations since
their discovery show a cyclical change.
The average time between maxima of
number seems to be about 11.2 years,
but often this time lapse will be as much
as five years longer or shorter.
The effects of sunspots are noticeable
here on Earth, 93 million miles from the
Sun. The occurence of aurora, known in
this hemisphere as "northern lights," in-
creases with an increase in sunspot activi-
ty. Radio disturbances and garbling of
telegraph messages accompany a solar
outburst. In addition to these purely elec-
trical disturbances, sunspot cycles affect
tree ring growth, probably through fluc-
tuations in the amount of energy emitted
by the Sun. In addition to the observable
variations in energy which accompany

DINOSAUR
PREFACE
I have spent an hour in the Hall of
Evolution in the University Museum. I
saw a great number of things there rang-
ing from Cambrian Trilobites to saber-
toothed tigers to present day man. The
dinosaur bones interested me, especially
the complete skeleton of the trachodon
or duck-billed dinosaur. The uncompre-
hendable hugeness of the bones led me
to ask myself the question, 'how did such
huge animals move around, and how
strong would they have to be to carry
around all their weight?' Therefore this
paper is entitled "The Engineering
Aspects of Dinosaurs," and goes into
these details as clearly as speculation
will allow.

eight to ten feet high and weighed any-
where from ten to twenty tons. It walked
on its hind legs and its feet were con-
structed so that it was a very good swim-
mer. Referring to Plate No. 1 the reader
will find a diagrammatic sketch of the
Trachodon reconstructed from the actual
skeleton.
The total cross section area of the tibia
and fibula is twenty-four square inches.
If the animal weighs 15 tons then each
hind leg must support 15,000 pounds and
the bone must be able to withstand
15,000/24 or 625 pounds per square inch.
Allowing for a safety factor of 4 this
means a material which has a compres-
sion strength of 2500 pounds per square

Referring to Plate No. 2, the reader

During the Mesozoic Period of geolog-
ical time around 1.5 x 108 years ago,
there roamed on the earth many millions
of reptiles. The larger of these were
called dinosaurs of which there were
numerous types; carnivorous, herbivor-
ous, and omnivorous animals. Some lived
entirely on the land and others led a semi-
aquatic life. The largest of all the dino-
saurs probably spent most of their lives
in fresh-water lakes, rivers and swamps.
A typical example of a dinosaur is the
Trachodon, or Duck-billed Dinosaur, of
which there is a complete skeleton in the
University Museum Hall of Evolution in
Ann Arbor. This animal ranged in size
from thirty to forty feet long, around
case, the material must withstand a com-
pressive load of 6000 pounds per square
inch though.
To understand just how strong this is,
some data on compressive strengths is
now called for. For example, the com-
pressive strength of wood ranges from
1490 pounds per square inch for northern
white cedar to a maximum of 6450
pounds per square inch for air-dryed
Douglas fir. Red oak is about 3500 and
hickory about 4500. Concrete has a com-
pressive strength of only 3120 pounds
per square inch while the strength of pure
aluminus is 5000 pounds per square inch.
In addition to the strength of the limbs
one should note the proportions and
needed strength of the ribs, vertebrae,
etc., in order to carry around 15 tons of
animal. There were bone nodules in the
skin itself in order to afford the animal
protection and also to give strength.
In order to propel an animal of this
size, huge quantities of food are required.
Plate No. 2: Right hind leg of a large
herbivorous dinosaur of the Jurassic
Period. Weight of animal about 50-60
tons of which probably, due to the ful-
crum arrangement of the tail, 35 tons
or more were concentrated on the hind
legs or \ll/z tons per leg. The fibula
and tibia combined represent an area
of 28 square inches which means a com-
pressive strength of 1250 #/si is re-
quired. Allowing for a safety factor of
4, the material of which the leg is made
must withstand a compressive load of
6000 #/si.
However, the reptiles should have been
very efficient on this score since they did
not use energy from their food in order
to heat their blood. Instead a method of
conduction and radiant heating from the
outside was employed thereby necessitat-
ing the fact that the animals were the
same temperature as their surroundings.
The defect in this was that if the air cool-
ed off, the dinosaur became sluggish and
inactive and therefore could not live in a
cold climate. Some of the smaller reptiles
devised a more efficient radiator by means

Aluminum Dipping Process for Coating
Steel Developed by GM
"Aldip," a new dipping process for
coating steel and other ferrous metals
with aluminum, has been announced by
General Motors Research Laboratories.
Alfred L. Boegehold, Assistant to the
General Manager of Research Labora-
tories, said importance of the new process
is twofold:
1. As a corrosion or rust resistant coat-
ing for ferrous metals, Aldip may in some
applications replace zinc coated metals.
2. When diffused by heat treatment,
Aldip becomes a heat resistant material.
This may conserve a number of strategic
alloys now used in high temperature ap-
plications, especially in defense produc-
tion.
Mr. Boegehold, assisted by Clarence J.
Tobin, Dean K. Hanink and Howard L.
Grange, developed the new technique
over a six-year period.
Mr. Boegehold explained that although
other methods are used for coating steel
with aluminum by hot dipping, they ap-
pear impracticable commercially or too
costly for large scale production.
The GM Research process, he added,
is a simple, practical, inexpensive method
for producing an aluminum base alloy
coating over ferrous metal of high qual-
ity. Another major advantage is the coat-
ing of an entire part or component where
a high degree of formability is required.
Also, Aldip can be a continuous process
for coating sheet, wire or rod stock,
Already Research Laboratories is pro-
ducing aluminum coated fabricated steel
manifolds for GM Detroit Diesel Engine-
Division. This pilot production is housed
in the new Metallurgy Building at GM
Technical Center, where other applica-
tions of Aldip are being tested.
Another pilot production is under way
at GM Harrison Radiator Division, Lock-
port, N. Y., with Aldip used on heat ex-
changers for an auxiliary tank motor, the
so-called "Little Joe," manufactured by
Detroit Diesel Engine Division. The heat
exchanger, consisting of two small tanks
connected by a series of parallel tubes
roughly similar to a miniature radiator,
has complex shapes or formability.
At Harrison Radiator Division the Al-
dip process is as follows:
Heat exchangers are dipped in an alka-
line cleaner, washed in hot water, run
through an acid pickle, rinsed in cold and
hot water and then dried in a furnace
until ready for coating. These steps re-
move grease, oil, paint, dirt, scale or
carbon smear, if cast iron is involved.
Next, they are dipped approximately
half inch deep. They remain in the alum-
inum from 30 seconds to one minute.
Thereafter, while still red hot, the
heat exchangers are returned to the pre-
heat salt bath and slowly raised. Inside
and out they assume a silvery appearance
as Aldip skin cools. Airblasting removes
excess aluminum.

at temperatures ranging from 1280 to

transferred to an aluminum bath which is
covered by a layer of salt flux about a

test. For instance, muffler inner tube as-
semblies with Aldip outlast by several
times plain steel center tube mufflers.
Exhaust tail pipes with Aldip also with-
stand corrosion longer than standard tail
pipes. Aldip lengthens their life against
heat and condensation rust.
Longevity of steel hangers, spacers, and
paint rack fixtures—all used in various
auto production operations—also has
been increased as a result of aluminum
dipping. It makes them more resistant
both to intense heat and acids.
Mr. Boegehold said properties of alum-
inum coated steel vary with steel compo-
sition and preparation, aluminum alloy
composition, time to dip, temperature of
dip, and subsequent heating of the coated
material. As yet, he said, the broad field
of these coatings has been only roughly
surveyed.
Microscopic examination of Aldip on
steel, however, reveals an outer coat of
aluminum bearing iron. A second layer,
next to the steel, is an iron-aluminum
alloy.
A major problem in developing Aldip
was designing a durable container for the
preheating salt flux and the dip. In a
progress report Mr. Hanink and Mr.
Grange said, "We found ourselves in the
position of the chemist who formulated
the perfect solvent and was then non-
plussed that nothing would hold it."
An idea that solved the problem came
from Mr. Boegehold, after he had ob-
served lighted Christmas candles floating
in a bowl of water on his dining room
table. The temperature variation between
the heated inner core of the candle and
the cooler outside rim literally made the
candle its own container, impervious to
water which would contaminate the hot,
liquid wax around the wick.
Consequently, furnaces in the Aldip
project were designed with an outside
steel shell lined with porous supporting
bricks. Salt permeates the brick when the
furnace is filled, providing a lining of the
same active salts used in the Aldip
process.
Largest Flexible Tubing Ever Made
Helps Test Air Conditioners
The largest piece of flexible tubing
ever made has just been fabricated by
Flexible Tubing Corp., Guilford, Conn.,
for the Development Laboratories, Air
Conditioning division, General Electric
Co., Bloomfield, N. J. The giant Spira-
tube will be used by G. E. as a psycho-
metric calorimeter to test self-contained
air conditioners in the 3-10 horsepower
range.
Here's how the 7 ft. diameter, 10 ft. 2
inch Spiratube works: the upper end of
the enclosure is secured to the test room
ceiling and the lower end drawn up. The
air conditioner to be tested is installed
underneath, the Spiratube enclosure then
lowered and secured to the floor. This
forms a room within a room about the
air conditioner.
General Electric
Using giant spiratube to test air condi-
tioner. This instrument reports tempera-
ure and humidity conditions of air after
it has passed through air conditioner in-
side the Spiratube enclosure.
Required temperature and humidity
readings are taken from wet and dry-
bulb thermometers placed in front of a
specially designed opening in the enclo-
sure's side. Through this opening warm,
moisture laden air is forced at a velocity
of 1000 ft. per min., circulated around
and into the air conditioner, cooled, then
drawn off through ductwork in the ceil-
ing. The resulting temperature and hu-
midity readings of this cooled air are
taken by wet and dry-bulb thermistors in
the ceiling.
Velocity of air admitted to the enclo-
sure is regulated by partially blocking or
unblocking the opening in the Spiratube
side. This opening—a window of 2 ft.
high by 3 ft. wide—will, when fully
open, admit 6000 cu. ft. of air per min-
ute at a constant velocity of 1000 ft.
per minute.
The light weight, easily retractable
Spiratube enclosure is made from mois-
ture and vapor proof neoprene impreg-
nated duck supported by spring wire
0.244 inches in diameter. The window in
the side is framed with aluminum for
greater strength. Result: An accurate, ef-
ficient, highly economical psychometric
calorimeter easy to install and simple to
dismantle.
The Spiratube enclosure and accom-
panying equipment meet American Society
of Refrigerating Engineers testing speci-
fications in all details. With it, G-E
Engineers can account for better than
98% of the heat and moisture entering
the conditioner.
Although this is the first time a Spira-
tube of this size has ever been used as a
psychometric calorimeter, smaller Spira-
tubes of similar construction have been in
use for some time as portable or semi-
permanent ventilation ducts, dust collec-
tion systems, and fume removal installa-
tions.
Spiratube products were originally de-
veloped for U. S. Navy use during World
War II. Since that time, Spiratubes of
various sizes and materials have found
application for mine and wind tunnel
ventilations, soot and furnace cleaning.
They are used to handle a wide variety
of materials including insecticides, ferti-
lizers, dehydrated foods, grains, and fibers
of all types.
Douglas Engineers Use Telemetry in
Supersonic Aircraft Tests
Douglas engineers are finding quicker
solutions to supersonic flight problems by
monitoring and directing high speed air-
craft tests from the ground.
This feat is accomplished by telemetry
—automatic radio transmission of tech-
nical information—which reports exact
conditions encountered throughout the
flight of an airplane.
How the system works was described
here, today, by Floyd E. Bryan, research
engineer of the Douglas Santa Monica
Division, in a paper presented before the
Institute of Radio Engineers convention.
Bryan disclosed that telemetering tech-
niques used for more than five years in
the company's missile development pro-
gram were modified to devise the system
for piloted aircraft. He said it is the
first successful method of continuously
monitoring test flights by telemetering the
readings of conventional airborne instru-
mentation.
"The system is small in size, simple in
theory and practice, and presents its data
in a manner that lends itself to automatic
data reduction," Bryan said.

veloped by the Douglas Testing Division,

many of the problems associated with
that tremendous growth. If you don't
mind I shall reminisce a little and review
some of the accomplishments that have
made this great industry what it is today.
All the generating capacity needed for
Detroit Edison load just prior to World
War I could be supplied by one of the
turbine generators most recently installed.
It has a capability of 125,000 kilowatts,
and it is but one of thirty of varying sizes
in the Detroit Editon system. It is obvi-
ous that needs for electric energy have
grown much faster than population itself.
In my time, generating plants have im-
proved so that we have reduced the num-
ber of pounds of coal needed to generate
a kilowatt hour from approximately 3
pounds to less than % of a pound in the
most efficient plants. It costs much more
to build each kilowatt of plant capacity,
and the price of coal has risen, but the
cost of electrical energy has been reduced.
For example—in 1915 when coal burned
by The Detroit Edison Company cost an
average of $2.21 per ton, a residential
customer paid an average of 6.04c per
kilowatt hour; in 1950 when coal costs
$7.89, the customer paid 3.08c.

The increased efficiencies of thermal
plants have been largely due to improve-
ments in materials and methods that al-

and pressures. Today 2,000 psi pressure

uncommon. As better materials and
methods are devised, you will see still
higher efficiencies. In a Company such as
ours that uses 4.2 million tons of coal a
year, the engineer who can show how to
increase the average efficiency of its
power plants by 1 percent would effect a
saving of $350,000 a year.
You can be sure that our engineers are
continually looking for ways and means
of reducing costs or improving service.
Several of them in a cooperative develop-
ment (one a young man who came to our
Company in 1946) have shown how to
make an annual dollar savings that runs
into six figures. We now make summer
weather in the winter for our stoker
fired steam generators by introducing
steam into the combustion process.
Through some phenomenon that we are
not yet sure about, this reduces slag for-
mation on tubes, thereby improving heat
transfer. Additional savings result from
reduced maintenance and shut-down time.
I am sure that there will be other im-
provements in operation of existing
plants that will show worthwhile savings.
I have seen boiler feed pumps as they
came from the manufacturer wear out in
two years. In our Research Laboratory of
forty engineers and scientists who wrestle
all kinds of utility problems, there is a
metallurgist who went to work on this
one. Suppliers have been assisted in de-
veloping alloys that will wear five times
longer when used in their high pressure
pumps.
When our urban load was 100,000
kilowatts and the distances not very great,
we could transmit efficiently at the gener-
ator voltages, but as the load increased it
became necessary to operate at higher vol-
tages. Years were spent in developing
insulation, underground cables, and cir-
cuit breakers that would give good serv-
ice at a transmission voltage of 24,000.
As the loads grew, the 1200 miles of
24,000 volt cable had to be augmented
with higher voltage transmission. We
now have fifty miles of a 120,000 volt
three-phase cable capable of carrying the
output of two 100,000 kilowatt genera-
tors.
It is a long story—citing all of the
problems and developments that brought
into successful operation this new high-
voltage underground cable system. The
cables are buried in 8-inch steel pipe cov-
ered with a coating to prevent corrosion.
The pipe is filled with 200 pounds of
nitrogen pressure to improve the insulat-
ing qualities of the cable. The oil im-
pregnated paper around each conductor is
about the same in thickness as on the con-
ventional 24,000 volt cable. This makes
for more efficient dissipation of PR
losses.
Special joints and terminals had to be
developed as well as methods of installa-
tion. The operating and maintenance

problems that continually arise with
equipment of this kind require the train-
ing and ingenuity of our best engineers
for their solution.
For a long time the suburban trans-
mission system handling bulk power has
been a steel tower line operating at
120,000 volts. We foresee the time when
that voltage may have to be increased
to 220,000 or 287,000 volts. Introduc-
ing such a change into an existing sys-
tem always brings with it new problems.
In the Detroit Edison service area of
7,000 square miles, 23,000 miles of
transmission and distribution lines are
carried on 579,000 wood poles. At one
time the life of a pole was at best about
15 years. Today poles are treated with
chemicals that inhibit fungus growth. If
pole life is only doubled, the savings are
tremendous when you consider that it
costs $150 to replace each old pole.

CONTEMPORARY DEMANDS ON ENGINEERING
DEAN GEORGE GRANGER BROWN
College of Engineering
University of Michigan
Engineering is defined as the "Art and Science by which
properties of matter and sources of power in nature are used
by man in structures, machines and manufactured products."
Art is defined as "skill or ingenuity in the adaptation of
things in the natural world to the uses of human life."
Science is defined as the "accumulated and accepted knowl-
edge which has been systematized and formulated with refer-
ence to general laws.
Putting these definitions together, it is clear that engineer-
ing includes the skill and ingenuity with a competent knowl-
edge of the general laws which summarize our knowledge of
matter and energy and their applications to structures, ma-
chines and products.
When Engineering curricula came into being, a century
or more ago, they were primarily descriptive or simple engi-
neering operations, such as surveying and drawing, supported
by courses in science, mathematics and languages. The engi-
neer, having no science of his own, relied almost entirely
upon the science of physics and a limited amount of chemis-
try and others, such as geology. This was a successful com-
bination and the engineer made many important contributions
until our civilization may now be regarded as dominated by
the activities of the engineer.
Engineers are avid experimentalists and acquire extensive
data on their operations. Imbued with the scientific spirit, they
correlate these data on similar operations in different indus-
tries. The chemical engineer based these correlations on the
Unit Operations, as suggested by A. D. Little in his report to
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1915:
"Any chemical process, on whatever scale conducted may be
resolved into a coordinate series of what may be termed "Unit
Operations' 'as pulverizing, drying, roasting, crystallizing, filter-
ing, evaporating, etc. The number of these basic unit operations
is not large and relatively few of them are involved in any par-
ticular process. The complexity of Chemical Engineering results
from the variety of conditions as to temperature pressure, etc.,
under which the unit operations must be carried out in different
processes, and from the limitations as to materials of construction
and design of apparatus imposed by the physical and chemical
character of the substances being treated."
Armed with such correlations, the engineer was able to
solve the problems of processing new materials, without any
previous experience in such processing. The only new infor-
mation required was a limited knowledge of the properties of
the material to be treated. Frequently, even these had to be
estimated due to the limited amount of the material available
for experiment. This ability was dramatically demonstrated
by the engineers of the DuPont Company in the design, con-
struction and operation of the nuclear reactors and plutonium
processing plants at Hanford in 1943- As the science of the
unit operations developed from 1920 to 1950, it gradually-
displaced the old technology courses which aimed to acquaint
the student with industrial practice, in particular industries.
The more complete our knowledge, the simpler is the
framework which can be used for systematizing the accumu-
lated facts. The unit operations themselves are undergoing
simplification. Absorption, stripping and fractionation are
now treated as one operation known as vapor-liquid transfer,
applied for different purposes; and vapor-liquid transfer is
further being closely associated with the corresponding liquid-
liquid and liquid-solid transfer operations. Fluid mechanics
is being studied and may become a common fundamental sci-
ence covering all fluid, mass and energy transfer operations,
such as fluid flow, mixing, mass transfer and heat transfer.
On the other hand, as more knowledge is accumulated and
accepted, the teacher is frequently persuaded that he must
have more time to acquaint the student with this additional
knowledge. But this point of view overlooks the most im-
portant characteristic of science, that is, the systematizing and
formulation of knowledge with reference to general laws. As
science advances, our general laws become more reliable and
with a more complete understanding of the basic general laws
a much better understanding can be given the student, in less
time, if the curriculum emphasizes the general laws of science
and their use in arriving at solutions to engineering problems,
rather than attempting to cover the accumulated and accepted
knowledge that is available. The latter approach tends to de-
velop an ability to solve only those problems which have been
solved, while the former tends to develop an ability to solve

sunspot cycles, spectroscopic analysis of
the sunspot regions gives evidence of
strong magnetic fields. A magnetic field
produces in a spectrograph the Zeeman
effect, the splitting of the ordinary atomic
lines of the spectrum.
With the knowledge of the electrical
disturbances and the presence of mag-
netic fields in sunspot regions, it has been
possible to formulate convincing theories
on the origin and nature of sunspots. The
astronomers of Galileo's time, once ac-
cepting the fact that sunspots were not

cyclonic theory. This theory attempts to
draw analogies between cyclonic storms
on Earth and the behavior of sunspots.
Cyclones on Earth are caused mainly by
two conditions, differential density of air
pressure at different latitudes and deflec-
tion of air masses by the rotation of the
Earth. The cold air in the polar regions
condenses and builds up a high pressure
mass which moves south and is deflected
to the west by the Earth's rotation. The
warm air masses at the equator move
northward and, because they are moving

area appears to have an eruptive rather than a cyclonic motion.
planets between Earth and the Sun,
thought that they were clouds floating
in the solar atmosphere. Today astrono-
mers view sunspots as disturbances on the
surface of the Sun, but still there are
two schools of theory as to their origin.
The oldest of the two theories is the
more rapidly than the air masses in the
intermediate zones, are deflected to the
east. The air mass caught between the
polar mass and the equatorial mass tends
to rotate and forms a cyclonic storm cen-
ter. Adherents to the cyclonic theory
maintain that the rapid rotation of the
Sun causes a similar condition on the sur-
face of the Sun, differing from cyclones
here only in that they extend deep into
the solar interior. They base their assump-
tions on the manner in which the spots
develope and decay, and how they are
affected by the Sun's rotation. Before the
appearance of the spot, the region indi-
cates a disturbance in the form of bright
and dark patches. Then the dark umbra
appears with the penumbra spread out
around it. When the spot decays, the
umbra and penumbra disappear leaving
the region blotched until the disturbance
ends completely. Observation of sunspots
as they are carried across the solar sur-
face by the Sun's rotation shows that
spots at the equator move much more
rapidly than the spots farther north or
south. The development and decay of the
spots and the effect of rotation on them
indicate that they might be similar to
Earth cyclones in origin.
Although the cyclonic theory explains
part of the sunspot phenomena, it does
not offer a very convincing explanation
for movements of gases within the spots.
These movements are not the familiar
circular or whirlpool movements of
Earth cyclones but eruptive movements.
Often flares of gases, solar prominences,
are thrown up from the disturbed region.
This indicates a more deep-seated origin
of the spots than merely the turbulence
caused by rotation.
The newer theory of the origin of sun-
spots is the magneto-hydrodynamic the-
ory. The very hot incandescent gases
which make up the Sun are liquified in
its interior by extreme pressure. These
liquified gases are excellent conductors
of electricity. Since such high pressures
as in the Sun's interior cannot be pro-
duced on Earth, mercury, a liquid and a
good conductor of electricity, is used to
simulate conditions in the solar interior.
It has been found that by placing mercury
in a tank and applying a strong vertical
magnetic field to it a slight movement at
the bottom of the tank will be trans-
mitted into exactly the same motion at
the top of the tank, while in a tank of
mercury with no magnetic field applied
any slight movement at the bottom of the
tank is dissipated almost immediately.
The strong magnetic field associated with
sunspots may be attributed to nuclear
reactions within the Sun. Disturbances

(Cu3AsS4) with some bornite (Cu5FeS4).
2) Intermediate zone—of irregular
width almost completely encircling the
central zone. Lesser amounts of pyrite
and copper minerals are found, but sil-
ver, zinc, lead, and manganese increase.
3) Peripheral zone—outer zone of
undetermined width bordering the inter-
may also involve different metals or dif-
ferent minerals of the same metal.
Generally, minerals which form at a
high temperature are found close to the
center of intrusion and the minerals
which form at a lower temperature are
found further from the center.
Many geologists believe a zonal ar-
rangement to be, primarily, a function of
the formation temperature of the mineral
species. As the distance from the intru-
sive center increases, the temperature de-
creases and successively lower temperature
minerals are deposited. However, some
deposits, like the tin in Bolivia, display

mediate zone. In this zone copper is
minor and manganese, lead, and silver
increase.
The veins continue outward from the
peripheral zone becoming less and less
mineralized and finally bearing only bar-
ren quartz and pyrite. The boundaries be-
tween zones are definitely not sharp.
Within a single vein the mineralogy grad-
ually changes from zone to zone.
The zonal arrangement at Butte is not
peculiar to the district. Geologists have
noted zoned ore deposits in many other
localities. The deposits of tin, copper,
lead, and zinc at Cornwall, England, and
the copper, lead, zinc, and silver at Bing-
ham, Utah display zoning around a cen-
tral area. Zoning may be either in a ver-
tical or horizontal direction or both. It
evidence which indicates that many other
factors besides temperature are impor-
tant. Among these are relative concen-
tration of constituents in the magma,
abundance, pressure, reaction between the
wall rock and ascending solutions, and
reactions with the solutions during pro-
gressive precipitation.
In 1947, the Anaconda Company be-
gan its "Greater Butte Project," a $27 mil-
lion project to exploit 150 million tons of
low grade ore. This development is the
first use of a block caving system in Butte.
The ore occurs in two huge bodies which
had been mined selectively for higher
grade veins and then abandoned.
A 4200 foot shaft, named after C. F.
Kelly, chairman of the Anaconda Com-
pany, was sunk 3000 feet from the ore
bodies. Drifts were driven from the shaft
to the ore. The section of the ore body
to be mined was then undercut by a
series of tunnels. Numerous chutes were
driven from the drift upward to the ore,
leaving a few pillars for support. As
these pillars are blasted away, the ore
above crumbles, passes through grizzlies
where it is sized, and finally falls
through chutes into ore cars. This sys-
tem allows a greater mass of ore to be
mined with fewer men and less equip-
ment than the previously used methods.
Butte is now experiencing the fourth
boom in its colorful history. Present esti-
mates indicate that the Greater Butte
Project will insure active mining for at
least 35 years more. Mr. C. F. Kelly re-
cently stated that the Greater Butte Proj-
ect is "but a forerunner of still greater
projects" and he predicted that "the
mineral wealth of Butte will not only en-
able it to maintain its position as a major
producer, but will, without any doubt,
enable it to become the greatest pro-
ducer of zinc and manganese in the
United States." *

Varied Mads of 71 Dn Pont plants pose
a bast of original power problems
Heart of Du Pont's manufacturing
program is the power plant. To make
some 1200 products and product lines
the Company operates 71 plants.
Most require steam and electric
generation, water supply and treat-
ment, heat exchangers, piping sys-
tems and related services. The de-
signing of these power plants, their
erection and operation are all in the
hands of engineers, the great majority
being mechanical engineers.
But this is not the most interest-
ing thing about power work here.
What challenges the highest skills of
the engineer at Du Pont is the wealth
of original problems constantly aris-
ing. Power requirements vary enor-
mously, not only from plant to plant
but from time to time.
Process operating pressures may
range from over 15,000 psi. to 2 mm
of mercury, electrical requirements
Oeorge S. Mahoffay, B.S. in M.E., Penn
State '52 (right), B. S. Norling, B.S. in E.E.,
Washington State '24, and A. S. Noell, Jr.,
B.S. in E.E., Duke '51, discuss the power
requirements of a new processing area.
This powerhouse for a nylon plant at Martinsville, Va., was designed by Du Pont engineers.
It houses two 135,000 Ib./hr. boilers and two 7,500 KW extraction turbine generators.
from as low as 7,000 to higher than
1 million KWH/day, and tempera-
tures from -360° to over 3,500°F.
Here are examples of recent "off-
the-beaten-path" power problems.
1. A plant using natural gas as its basic
fuel produces a waste oil of variable hy-
drocarbon composition and a waste gas
with only 110 Btu/cu. ft. Du Pont M.E.'s
designed burners, fans, boilers and com-
bustion controls to permit use of all
three fuels for generating steam.
2. At another plant 20,000 gpm of cool-
ing water were to be drawn from a nearby
river. Since the water level fluctuated
40 feet between normal and flood stages,
it was necessary to evaluate several plans
for pump-house constructions against
cooling towers. The engineers installed
a unique pump house whose submerged
vertical pumps operate even when the
structure is entirely under water.
Aside from design and construc-
tion, Du Pont mechanical engineers
concern themselves with such related
subjects as economic evaluations,
equipment selection, heat balances,
load calculations, waste heat boilers.
For example, where various process
temperatures from 300° to 600°F. were
required, Dowtherm was selected as the
supply medium at the rate of 35 million
Btu/hr. The engineers installed a central
system for primary supply because it
calculated to be more economical than
separately located vaporizers.
On the operational side, M.E.'s
supervise the supply of power and
services. They establish performance
standards and analyze equipment for
results, cost and maintenance.

Whether viewed from the design
and construction side or the opera-
tional side, the diversity of Du Pont's
manufacture offers a wealth of op-
portunities in power work for the me-
chanical engineer.

headed by Donald Douglas, Jr., test data
had been recorded by motion picture
cameras and other devices carried on the
airplane.
Only after each flight was completed
and the recorded data evaluated were
engineers able to proceed with the next
step.
Now, engineers seated at a console are
able to obtain instantaneous, detailed
information on any particular character-
istic of performance during a test flight.

In addition to the visual presentation,
of course, the telemetering system makes
a continuous record of the entire flight on
magnetic tape and motion picture film.
Consequently, any portion of the flight
may be reproduced for observation or sub-
sequent detailed analysis.
"The airborne portion of the equip-
ment occupies less than two cubic feet
of space and weighs less than 110
pounds," Bryan said. The complete sys-
tem is comprised of two separate 88

is capable of sending information from
176 separate measuring devices at the rate
of 16 samples per second for each, mak-
ing a total of some 3000 items of intelli-
gence per second.
This information is received in a mo-
bile telemetering trailer housing the FM
radio receivers, motion picture cameras,
tape recorders and monitoring scopes.
It appears in the form of lines of vary-
ing length on the monitor scopes and on
35 mm. film or is recorded as impulses of
varying length on the magnetic tape.
To supplement the telemetering sys-
tem, Douglas uses its own automatic data
analyzer which quickly translates the
lines into curves or graphs which record
air speed, strain readings, engine and
structural temperatures, airplane and con-
trol positions, pressures, flutter and simi-
lar data.
Succeeds the Famous 270
A new high-compression GMC truck
engine with the best power-to-weight
ratio ever achieved in the trucking indus-
try was announced by Roger M. Kyes,
vice president of General Motors and
general manager of the GMC Truck and
Coach Division.
Exclusively truck-engineered and truck-
built, the new 302 cubic inch engine has
a compression ratio of 7.2 to 1—highest
of any standard gasoline truck engine—
and generates 145 gross brake horsepower
at 3,600 R.P.M.
Weighing only 545 pounds (dry), the
GMC 302 is as much as 500 pounds
lighter than other engines of comparable
power, a weight factor of considerable
significance to truckers looking for more
pay load.
The new engine will be placed in the
popular GMC 450 and 470 (2l/2 ton and
3 ton) model series trucks and tractors,
according to Kyes.
GMCs new 302 succeeds the famed
270 cu. in. engine in the GMC 450 and
470 model series and, like its predecessor,
already has a significant military history.
While the 270 powered more than
600,000 of the rugged GMC 6 x 6*s in
World War II, the 302 has been placed
in the newest GMC 6x6 design, the
spectacular M-135 with Hydra-Matic
drive.
Secret of the 302's high compression
ratio is what engineers call "built-in" or
"mechanical" octanes. Through long re-
search in design of cylinder heads, piston
contours, valve and spark plug locations,
detonation or "spark-knock" tendencies
have been so reduced that full power can
be attained with regular gasoline.
Increased operating efficiencies are

ceptionally low piston speed which,
coupled with trans-slot aluminum alloy
pistons and low-friction chrome plated
top piston rings, achieves an increase in
mechanical efficiency.
Structural rigidity of the new GMC
engine has been emphasized for pro-
longed operation under full loads. The
cylinder block and crankcase are cast as a
unit to form a rugged backbone for the
engine, while the upper crankcase is
sturdily ribbed. The crankshaft is heat-
treated, stress-relieved and "Tocco" hard-
ened for long bearing life and maximum
durability.
The relatively short stroke and resultant
short throw of the crankpins make pos-
sible an appreciable overlap between main
bearing journals and connecting rod
throws, contributing materially to tor-
sional rigidity. The torsional vibration
damper also aids by absorbing vibration
impulses.
The new M-400 Moraine bearings,
estimated to have six to ten times the life
of conventional babbit bearings and four
to six times more load-carrying capacity,
are used at the crankshaft main journals
and connecting rod lower ends. The bear-
ings combine durability, fatigue resis-
tance, embedability, corrosion resistance
and anti-scoring qualities.

HOW MANY KIT TO A FOOT...
A one-foot length of this six-strand, steel-sinewed
piece of wire rope has 150 or more feet of wire. And
each wire in this precision product must be accurate
within a thousandth of an inch.
It wasn't always so. But deeper mines and oil wells,
higher buildings, greater logging, shipbuilding and
construction projects called for stronger, safer rope
... without increase in diameter. So rope engineering
became a science.
SINEW OF INDUSTRY...
Special steels with the right combination of fatigue
and abrasion resistance . . . skillful wire drawing . . .
lubricant-saturated fiber centers . . . and scores of
sizes, grades and "constructions" are necessary to
meet today's wire rope requirements.
Wire rope manufacture represents the contribu-
tions of countless craftsmen whose challenge was
industry's need . . . whose accomplishments, indus-
try's gain.
AMERICA WORKS LIKE THAT...
Keeping alert to the needs of business and industry
. . . and meeting them under competitive conditions
. . . has characterized America's growth.
And keeping people abreast of these developments
is the job of America's all-seeing, all-hearing and
reporting Inter-Communications System.
THE AMERICAN INTER-COM SYSTEM...
Complete communication is the function, the unique
contribution of the American business press ... a
great group of specially edited magazines devoted to
the specialized work areas of men who want to man-
age better, design better, manufacture better, re-
search better, sell better, buy better.
COMMUNICATION IS OUR BUSINESS...
The McGraw-Hill publications are a part of this
American Inter-Communications system.
As publishers, we know the consuming insistence
of editors on analyzing, interpreting and reporting
worthwhile ideas. We know that business men, in
order to keep abreast of their jobs, subscribe to—pay
for—McGraw-Hill magazines edited for their specific
business interests . . . for the editorial pages tell
"how" and the advertising pages tell "with what."
A CAREER FOR YOU...
To a few engineering graduates, "McGraw-Hill"
will mean "writing" as well as "reading."
Spurred by experience on college magazines, or
broadened by work in industry, these men will join
those of earlier classes who are now McGraw-Hill
engineering editors.
If you are thinking their way, tell our Personnel
Relations Department (College Section)—now—
about your qualifications for an editorial career.

SUNSPOTS
(Continued from page 26)
ence of this strong magnetic field, according to the magneto-
hydrodynamic theory, would be communicated to the surface
of the Sun through the liquified gases as the movement is
through mercury.
The magneto-hydrodynamic theory of the origin of sun-
spots explains much more convincingly the effects of the sun-
spots observed on Earth—radio disturbances, aurora, and
variations in tree ring growth. The powerful electric currents
emanating from a sunspot region would produce radio waves
to disturb communications and cause the rarified gases of the
upper atmosphere to glow. The large amount of energy
emitted at a sunspot maximum would affect the growth of
tree rings during that period. In addition, the cyclonic theory
of spots explains poorly, at best, the formation of solar
prominences, while the magneto-hydro-dynamics theory draws
an analogy between them and the luminous discharges of a
laboratory discharge tube. It is possible, too, that the Sun
may be the source of some of the so-called cosmic rays which
continually invade the Earth's atmosphere.
Neither of these theories can be proved as yet; however,
the evidence is being weighed thoroughly. Perhaps, with de-
velopment in electronics and astronomical equipment, the
problem may be solved within the next few years.
An old Southern colonel was making a trip through Tur-
key and one day hired a guide to take him on a personal trip
through a Sultan's harem. While wandering through the
halls he recognized a burly black attendant as a former hand
on his southern plantation.

earth are you doing away over here?"
"Well, suh boss," replied the grinning Negro, "Ah'll tell
you. Ah has de best job in de worl'. Every day ah sits heah
in front o' dis yeah doorway. Ah has a bowl o' water in

Grains
They are catalyst supports — Norton
refractory products made of chemically
inert, heat-resistant, wear-resistant
materials for use as catalytic carriers in
chemical processes. Pictured in spherical
shape here, they are also available as
pellets and rings.
Composition and Properties
These supports are commercially
available in ALUNDUM* (fused alpha
alumina) mixtures varying from 77% to
89% alumina with silica as the principal
impurity. In addition to their refrac-
toriness, they are chemically inert, me-
chanically strong and wear-resistant,
Water absorption values of these sup-
ports vary from 12% to 22% by weight.
Surface areas by the nitrogen absorption
method range up to about one square
meter per gram. Crushing strengths vary
from 20 to 600 pounds, depending on size
and shape, and bulk densities range from
60 to 80 pounds per cubic foot.
Many Refractory Products
Catalyst supports are but one of many
refractory products made by Norton.
These include small furnace refractories
such as tubes, cores and muffles; large
furnace refractories such as bricks,
plates, muffles and other shapes; re-
fractory cements; refractory laboratory
ware; kiln furniture for ceramic plants.
In its search for refractory products
that can be used at higher and higher
temperatures, Norton has developed a
line of pure oxide refractories. These re-
fractory shapes, as their name implies,
are molded without bond and then fired
at sufficiently high temperatures to pro-
duce a truly sintered product.
The principal raw materials used in
the manufacture of Norton pure oxide
refractories are ALUNDUM (fused
alumina), MAGNORITE* (fused mag-
nesia), fused stabilized ZIRCONJA and.
to a limited degree, fused thoria.

Fall is here again and what could be
better than a few teasers to sharpen up
the old brain before we get down to the
more serious stuff? Well, to get started,
here's an old favorite that's kicking
around in new form:
Two ladders, one 20 feet long and the
other 30 feet long, are placed between
two buildings so that the foot of one lad-
der rests against the same wall as the head
of the other, and vice-versa. If the point
of intersection of the two ladders is 10
feet above the ground, what is the width
of the alley between the buildings?
Here's one that's a little harder. Let's
see if you remember your Descriptive
Geometry. A fly (muca domestica) is at
the center of the floor of a room 30 feet
long, 20 feet wide, and 12 feet high.
How far will it walk by taking the short-
est path to one of the upper corners of
the ceiling?
The next time you drive into Detroit
for a week-end, you can amuse yourself
with this little tidbit. A car going 30
mph leaves Ann Arbor headed for De-
troit, a distance of 45 miles. At the same
time another car leaves Detroit for Ann
Arbor going 15 mph. At the time that the
car left Ann Arbor, there had been a bee
sitting on the hood ornament, but he took
off, and flying at 50 mph, he flew up the
road to Detroit, where he met the car

Every once in a while you run across a
problem that deserves the title of 'a
classic' While thumbing through the
Purdue Engineer looking for dirty jokes
the other day, I came upon this dilly. I
feel that this problem probably represents
the zenith for this particular type of
teaser.
A man and wife, celebrating their
twentieth wedding anniversary, have a
son and twin daughters. The age of the
wife equals the combined ages of the chil-
dren. When the couple first met, three
years before their marriage, the man's
age was half again as much as the
woman's. In as many years from now as
each twin is now old, the combined ages
of the parents will be half again as much
as the combined ages of the children then.
Double the husband's present age plus
the present age of the son is equal to
double the wife's age plus three time.s
the age of one twin. When the couple's
silver wedding anniversary arrives, the
son's age will be half the age of his
mother's then and equal to the com-
bined present age of the twins. If the
family survives to the date of the
golden anniversary, the son will be as old
as his father is now and the combined
ages of the children will be half again
as much as the combined present ages of
the parents. What are the present ages of
each member of the family?
This one is really old. I suspect that
this teaser has been kicking around as
long as that "Who was that woman I saw
you with last night" joke. But here it is
again, so let's see what you can do with it.
A merchant pays duty on certain goods
at three different places. At the first, he
gives one-third of the goods, at the sec-
ond, one-fourth (of the remainder), and
at the third, onet-fifth (of the remainder).
The total duty is 24. What was the
original amount of the goods?
In ancient days, Justice was a little more
sporting than it is today, and so it seems
that a prisoner sentenced to die was given
a chance for survival if he used his head.
Here's how the deal worked: The pris-
oner was given 10 white balls, 10 black

Suppose, as you enter a grocery store, you
suddenly find the denomination of every bill
in your pocket has doubled! You're rich! Until
you find that the same "magic" has doubled the
price of everything in the store.
That's the sort of "prosperity" America has
been "enjoying."
Most Americans feel they're worth more today
than a few years ago; actually their savings have
been whittled away 23% in the 7 years since the
war. More money without more goods always bids
prices up and up to the sky.
If you like what's been happening to you, if
you think this is prosperity, let's make a good job
of it; let's make every bill a million dollar bill—
or a billion, as Germany did. If inflated money
makes everybody happy, let's be hysterical!
But Germany didn't find it much fun, the
morning after.

that makes the day-to-day ones seem
small. Since 1946 the load has grown
faster than any of us predicted at that
time. When the Korean War hit us, we
had plans for rebuilding a portion of an
old plant. Removing some of the less
efficient generators to make space for
new ones meant reducing our capacity
at a time when the load predictions made
that seem unwise. New trends in auto-
matic operation and defense considera-
tions also favored the construction of an
entirely new plant at another location.
Suddenly plans were shifted to build a
new fifth plant—the first new location
in over 25 years.
But it takes 3 years from the time you
decide to build a new plant until you
have it in operation. Economic studies
were quickly made to decide where to
locate it—fortunately we had already pur-
chased land at two different places. Other
important decisions related to tempera-
tures and pressures that give the highest
economy ... to sizes of generators and
boilers ... to reheat cycles ... to unit

tor .. . to 3600 rpm vs 1800 rpm and to

Building a new power plant means
changes and additions to parts of the
transmission and distribution system.
For every $1 spent for the new plant, $2
wjll eventually be spent in new lines,
switching stations, and substations that
deliver the power to the customers.
I could go on citing a number of ex-
amples of engineering problems that at
times appeared insurmountable, but now
let's take a look at the future.
Electricity has become almost as essen-
tial to modern living as food and cloth-
ing. It keeps production going in the
factories, milking machines on the farms,
and deep-freezes and furnaces in our
homes. Engineers and managers are mak-
ing their plans today for a rate of growth
in the next twenty years as great as that
of the past twenty years. Under those

kilowatts today will reach 200,000,000
by 1969. Property and plants will be
worth $65 billion, and annual revenues
$11.5 billion.
I believe that it is no secret that there
are now under way long-range studies on
applications of atomic energy to produc-
tion of electricity. If and when that hap-
pens, methods of steam generation will
be changed and there will be new engi-
neering and management problems. Of
more immediate interest is the use of
radioactive isotopes as tracers. Industry
is on the threshold of a new method of
solving many of the engineering prob-
lems, and it will be a young man's field.
Future growth and changes will bring
opportunities and achievements greater
than I have experienced during my 40
years in this business. Some of our engi-
neers today feel that the engineering
problems associated with the design, con-
struction, operation, and maintenance of
power plants and electrical systems may-
grow even faster than the load. Oppor-
tunities for thinking up new ways of get-
ting jobs done, and of improving service
and reducing costs will go on and on.
This is an engineer's business. The job
of making and selling kilowatt hours de-
pends on the engineering science all the
way from the source of energy to the
customer's meter. Even the problems that
are of an economic nature are associated
with either materials or methods that re-
quire an engineering knowledge and
background for their solution. The ma-
jority of top management positions will
be filled by engineers.
In planning your career, keep in mind
also that the place you work and the
people you work with will have an in-
fluence on your success and happiness as
well as what you do. The utility indus-
try has long been a leader in employee
relations and can point with pride to its
achievements in that field.
If you are looking for a challenge for
your abilities, and an opportunity for a
lifetime of professional growth, those of
us who are about to pass on the torch to
younger men commend for your careful
consideration this great industry. Along
with glamour, there is security, and with
progress—stability.

How agricultural engineers solve
3 design problems at once
Designing farm machinery applications like the through
shafts of disk harrows presents three big problems to
agricultural engineers: 1) combination loads, 2) dirt,
3) ease of operation. Engineers solve all three problems
at once by designing the shafts on Timken® tapered
roller bearings. Because they are tapered, Timken bear-
ings carry both radial and thrust loads in any combina-
tion. They keep housings and shafts concentric, making
closures more effective. Dirt stays out—lubricant in.
And they keep shafts turning easily because of their true
rolling motion and incredibly smooth surface finish.
How to mount disk
harrow shafts on TIMKEN bearings
Two single-row Type TS Timken bearings are indirectly
mounted on a stationary shaft in a rotating disk assembly.
The bearing cups are press-fitted against snap rings. The
bearings are adjusted by means of shims between the bear-
ing cone and shaft shoulder. A special spring-backed rub-
bing seal assures maximum protection to the bearings. The
rubbing seal itself is protected by a shield fitted about the
closure assembly.

the hind legs were moved toward the
head so as to support the middle sec-
tion. It was then found that . . .
if the animal were equipped with a
heavy tail, its entire weight could be
made to balance on the two hind legs.
Inasmuch as the two front legs were not needed now, they became shorter and
smaller. The animal found that since it did not use these legs, it could see a lot
better if it would stand on its two hind legs. Therefore we have the erect animal.
The chest cavity, etc. were not designed to be used in a vertical position so the
animal developed troubles along this line.
of having long bones covered with skin
and blood vessels protrude in a sort of
fin from their back. These reptiles could
live in a cooler climate in this manner.
A dinosaur was a machine of prob-
ably 500 horsepower which means that it
needed approximately three million cal-
ories for the day if it slept half the time
and used none for growing and was
100% efficient. In comparison, a per-
son consumes around 3000 calories per
day of which a lot is used to heat his
body.
As to the muscles necessary to move
such a mass: a person in standing on his
toes exerts nearly 500 pounds of force in
his leg muscles. A dinosaur under simi-
lar circumstances would have to exert a
force of 50,000 pounds—a hefty push.
Yes, the dinosaurs were great ma-
chines which are even hard to equal with
man made monsters. But, they died off
in the course of evolution in order to
make way for higher forms of life. The
tremendous quantities of food required,
the nearly perfect climate necessary, and
the inability of the reptiles of that dimen-
sion to cope with smarter animals, which
were developing all the time, were fac-
tors which brought about their downfall.
The reptile had the great disadvantage of
being unable to protect its young when
hunting for food. As food became
scarcer, the dinosaurs had to hunt further
and further from its nest thus leaving its
eggs to be stolen by marauders. Yes, the
dinosaurs are gone, but we can still find
the bones and speculate as to how these
animals looked and what their habits
were. They were just another stepping
stone in the road of evolution.

those problems which must be solved.
Was it Einstein who said, "Scientists are
those people who solve the problems
which they can solve, and engineers are
the people who solve the problems which
have to be solved?"
The decisions in design, construction,
management and operation are usually
based on incomplete data, but made on
the basis of judgment, ingenuity and ex-
perience guided by an appreciation of the
fundamental general laws of science are
the highest form of engineering com-
bining art and science.
There are two exacting demands on
contemporary engineering curricula in the
presentation of science. The first is to
emphasize and develop an understanding
of the basic general principles which con-
stitute true science and to forego the
teachers desire for complete presentation
of his knowledge. This must be reserved
for postgraduate courses, in special fields.
A firm foundation in the general laws of
science is also an excellent background
for graduate study as well as for the
practice of engineering. Second, because
the student is to be prepared for engi-
neering practice in the future twenty to
thirty years, and because the frontiers of
science today are the accepted basic prin-
ciples of engineering practice tomorrow,
the student should be exposed to the most
modern thinking in physics and chem-
istry, and not simply to those principles
currently accepted and which he might be
called upon to use today. The college, or
university, is the best opportunity af-
forded the student to become acquainted
with these modern concepts. Technology
and current industrial practice have no
place in a curriculum in engineering,
except as examples in the application of
general principles. Descriptive technol-
ogy taught in school is almost certain to
be obsolete by the time the student reaches
a responsible position in practice, and cur-
rent industrial practice is best learned on
the job.
The ability to take the responsibility
for a solution based on incomplete data
and thereby create a new process or a new
design is an outstanding characteristic of
the engineer. It can be acquired or de-
veloped as witness the number of indi-
viduals trained as scientists in chemistry,
physics or mathematics who become suc-
cessful engineers by acquiring this skill
or ingenuity and experience. But it is
necessary to be certain that the graduate
engineer has at least a certain minimum
of this art by requiring him to demon-
strate his ingenuity in some creative proj-
ect before graduation; otherwise he may
be a "mere scientist" equipped with tools
but unable to use them.
There are many other collateral de-
mands in addition to the general scientific
background and experience in creative
work such as the design of a new device
or process which must be satisfied if the
curriculum is to be wholly adequate. The
development as well as the expression of
ideas requires the effective use of lan-
guage of some kind. When we say a
man thinks in English, or in German, or
in mathematics, we mean exactly that.
Language is a tool for thinking as well as
for expression, and the engineer uses at
least three languages for these purposes:
English or his native tongue, mathematics
to an ever increasing degree, and graphi-
cal presentation or drawing. To be effec-
tive, the use of language must be precise
and easy. This requires constant and care-
ful use. Therefore, the student must al-
ways be required to use, and use correctly,
these three languages in his professional
course. It will not do to delegate the re-
sponsibility for the correct use of English
to the English department, or for mathe-
matics to the Mathematics department,
or for drawing to the drawing depart-
ment and then ignore these matters in the
professional courses any more than it
would be considered satisfactory to ignore
the principles of science developed in the
basic science courses, in teaching the pro-
fessional engineering subjects in the
senior year. Such practices undo all the
good work of the English mathematics,
drawing and science departments and
gives the student the idea that having
completed these courses, he now has no
further use for them and instead will con-
centrate on his professional work.
Practically no engineering graduate
fails in industry because of technical in-
adequacy, but many fail of realizing their
potential success because of inability to
write effective reports, to present their
ideas effectively before a Board, or to
work smoothly with their associates. This
last requirement leads to another demand
on modern engineering curricula, to train
and develop the student to work well
with his associates. This cannot be done
if he is always required to do individual
work throughout his entire college pro-
gram. Any number of courses in psychol-
ogy will accomplish practically nothing
compared with actual experience in work-
ing with others. Perhaps this is a major
advantage in the cooperative curricula if
the student learns to work with others
during his apprenticeship in industry.
But much can be done in requiring stu-
dents to work in squads in many courses
in the normal full-time program. The
senior laboratory and design courses are
excellent opportunities for this experience
which also has advantages in developing
technical ingenuity.
The requirement for admission as a candidate
to the doctorate in Chemical Engineering has
included for many years the preparation of a
satisfactory engineering report which included
the design for a new process. This is known
as the twenty-one day problem because of the
time allowed. One of these involved the eco-
nomics of recovering the solvent from extracted
bean meal. The successful students and the
faculty had come to believe that such a process
was not economical. In the course of time
this doctoral problem became a senior project
in which the seniors work in groups of three,
each group operating as a separate firm of
consulting engineers. One resourceful group
of seniors went into the laboratory, obtained
some data, and established the fact that it was
economical to recover the solvent if the dried
unextracted beans were used to absorb the
solvent vapor.
Industry and the world is made up of
human beings, and the engineer is a much
better engineer if he has fully developed
human interests. These are generally best
developed by voluntary activities on the
part of the individual in participating in
extra-curricular activities such as debate,
sports, editorial work—and in courses in
the humanities such as history, literature,
philosophy, or music. The student must
be given an opportunity and encourage-
ment to develop and pursue these inter-
ests. I think this best done on a voluntary
basis and such courses should be handled
as electives. Otherwise, they are frequent-
ly regarded as simply additional hurdles
to be overcome.
To meet these contemporary demands,
the undergraduate instruction must be
streamlined. We must recognize the ad-
vances that have been made and are
being made in all fields and continually
revise our presentations to eliminate all
that which is not absolutely essential.

A NEW TREND IN INDUSTRIAL ADVANCEMENT
In the history of industrial development, tech-
nological improvements have always been the
most significant advances, but now with ma-
chines in many industries nearing perfection,
new developments in another field are becom-
ing increasingly important. This field is labor-
management relations. Experiments and sur-
veys in many industries have shown that a man
can not be made to work efficiently at his job if
he has no desire to do so. Even bribing him
with higher wages will not do the trick. What
is it then, that will make a man want to put
more effort and thought into his work? A
recent Roper poll showed that the desire to be
treated as a human being and to have dignity
while at work actually rated ahead of high
wages for workers in large factories.
Men will work at jobs which they don't like,
which bore them, and which they do not under-
stand, but they will take no interest in their
work and will do only what has to be done in
order to draw their pay checks. On the other
hand, if the jobs can be made pleasant and in-
teresting and the workers made to understand
the importance and significance of their work,
the men will take pride in doing their job well.
If workers are treated like machines they can
not be expected to be any more interested in
their work than machines are, and most jobs
now require something more than mechanical
reactions from the workmen.
The graduate engineer employed in industry
is in a position to increase the efficiency of many
employees by keeping the principles of human
relations in mind. He can make the workers
more comfortable and their jobs more pleasant
by considering their problems when he designs
their equipment and surroundings. He can ex-
plain to the men how their work fits into the
production of the whole factory, and the im-
portance of their individual jobs. He can show
the workers how their equipment is constructed
and tell them why it is made as it is. He can tell
them why changes have to be made in their

• Threading its way through a gi-
gantic continuous-annealing furnace
at speeds up to 1000 feet per minute,
steel strip behaves erratically. It
tends to wander and weave. It fouls
the rolls. Sometimes it breaks. Then
production on a multi-million-dollar
unit, designed for high-speed opera-
tion, slows down or stops dead ... a
very costly business.
To solve this problem—to keep
strip from running crooked—all sorts
of schemes have been tried; crowned
rolls, higher tension on the strip,
side guides. None of them worked as
hoped for. Each merely added new
problems of its own. To make mat-
ters worse, with recent trends to
longer strip, to higher speeds and
longer processing lines, these track-
ing and aligning difficulties were fur-
ther aggravated.
But the answer has been found.
In the development of the Lorig
Aligner, United States Steel has
come up with a novel, yet surpris-
ingly simple solution. For these rolls,
named for the inventor—a U. S.
Steel engineer—are automatically self
centering. Set in the continuous-
annealing line shown here, they now
track the strip—no matter what its
speed—relentlessly toward the cen-
ter of the roll. These remarkable rolls
even anticipate trouble and realign
wayward strip 30 feet before it
reaches the roll.
The result? Clean, bright strip,
flat and undamaged, uniformly and
perfectly annealed, reeling off the
delivery end at the rate of 1000 feet
per minute.
The U-S-S Lorig Aligner—a bril-
... at 1000 feet
per minute!
liant application of basic engineering
principles—is full of promise not
only for continuous strip lines of all
kinds, but wherever production de-
pends on accurate tracking of the
material. In other words, if centering
and alignment is the problem, the
Lorig Roll is literally the key to con-
tinuous high-speed production.
The Lorig Aligner is another ex-
ample of United States Steel's active
research program which has enabled
countless manufacturers to improve
their production methods and make
better products in the bargain. In
the field and in research laboratories,
trained U. S. Steel engineers and
metallurgists are working to help
make the manufacture of steel—and
its use — more efficient.

THE U-S-S LORIG ALIGNER consist, of a divided roll (conical effect exaggerated
at the right) with each conical half running on a common rotating axle that is
slight ly deflected in the center so that t he upper surfaces of the cones form a straight
surface. As the strip passes over the roll, strongly converging lateral forces arc
set up to exert a powerful centering action on the strip that immediately corrects
any deviation and keeps the strip running straight and true.

DOW PLASTICS PLANT
TO SERVE
EASTERN
INDUSTRY
Bright, colorful Styron (Dow polystyrene), the plastic that adds
new eye-appeal and utility to many different products, will now
be more easily available than ever to the Eastern molder. For Dow,
the pioneer and producer of Styron, as well as other plastics,
has just completed a large new Styron plant at historic Allyn's
Point, Connecticut.
This plant has 2,000 square feet of production space on each of
four floors, along with a large warehouse and administration
building. Because past experience has proved that rapid growth is a
condition normal to Dow operation, the plant has been constructed
to allow for future expansion.
This Styron plant is located on an 80-acre plot on the Thames
River. Dow also built an 800-foot dock to handle ocean-going
vessels. Here they will receive many raw materials from their
Texas Plant and ship Styron to Eastern markets and many
export markets throughout the world.
This new Styron plant is but one of the many new developments
at Dow. The increasing demands of industry for chemicals
necessitate continued expansion in every sphere of Dow operation
, . . expansion that requires new plants, new technical facilities,
as well as a continual increase in personnel talented in vary-
ing phases of science.

Last spring at the 31st annual con-
vention of the Natural Gasoline Associa-
tion of America, Theodore W. Legatski
was awarded the Hanlon award, highest
honor in the natural gasoline industry.
Legatski, the sixteenth winner of this
award, is Assistant Director of Research
for the Phillips Petroleum Company of
Bartleville, Oklahoma.
Legatski was born in Alpena, Michigan
in 1901 and was graduated from the
public schools there. In 1920 he was
awarded an industrial scholarship which
enabled him to come to the University.
In 1925 he joined the staff of Phillips
as a research engineer. In 1929, he was
made supervisor of the Burbank labora-
tories of the company, and soon after
took over the duties of assistant director
of research.
During the war Legatski headed the
research of Phillip's laboratories at Phil-
lips, Texas, where important wartime re-
search on aviation gasoline, butadiene and
synthetic rubber was done,

City Engineer of Manila for seventeen
years. A brilliant Administrator, he was
successively Mayor of Davao City, Mayor
of Zamboanga City and Governor of the
province of Bukidnon.
"He pioneered the zonification of Ma-
nila, conceived its building code, intro-
duced new methods of assessment, and
improved housing conditions. To him,
more than to any other single man,
Manila owes its pure water supply. An
eminent educator, he was professor of
Mathematics and Hydraulics at the Uni-
versity of Santo Tomas for twenty-seven
years, Dean of the College of Engineer-

OF THE ENGINEER
BY
EUGENE W. COLEMAN, '53E
In the increasingly technological society
of today, the professional services of the
engineer are in greater demand than at
any time in history. To meet this demand
and at the same time provide a secure fu-
ture for ourselves, many of us are now
working toward degrees in engineering.
In our effort to become engineers, we
often look no further than the degree we
are seeking. What, in reality, is an engi-
neer, and what are his responsibilities—
social as well as ethical?
To a great many people, an engineer
is the stereotyped movie version; complete
with boots, breeches, leather jacket,
sloppy hat, crude language and manners
to match, and a devil-may-care attitude.
To the campus coed, an engineer is the
young man with a slide rule swinging
from the belt of his suntans. He seems
to have little time for dates. With the
fellows in his house he probably has a
reputation of hard work and the odd habit
of talking to other engineers about
"thermo" and "strength" and "descrip."
Probably none of these people know
what an engineer really is, for too often
we become so absorbed in ourselves and
our work that we present a dim view.
More important, perhaps, is the fact that
we give so little thought to the matter that
few of us are truly aware of our future
and our responsibilities. We are so busy
learning theory and observing practice
that we do not give the proper thought to
that future, and even now we are denying
our responsibilities. For after all, the
same people we associate with today as
students will be our business contacts,
consumers and neighbors tomorrow. The
need for understanding each other begins
now. In trying to reach such an under-
standing, the first step is in recognizing
our responsibilities and freely admitting
them.
As practicing engineers our employers
will expect us to accept responsibility.
They will expect a job to be done without
feeling the necessity of peering over our
shoulders to see that the work is done ac-
cording to standard. As far as possible,
they want to trust in the judgment of
EUGENE W. COLEMAN
their engineers. This represents no small
responsibility, and as engineers we are, or
at least should be ready to admit and ac-
cept it as such. These technological or
ethical responsibilities are more readily
acceptable because they are better known,
and if we can see social responsibilities
in this same light, they, too, will be more
easily accepted.
The basis for social responsibility on
the part of engineers seems to be to arise
from one simple fact. Technology has
built a world in which society finds ad-
justment a much slower process. The so-
cial structure of yesterday does not match
the technical advance that brought today.
Each new development has meant its
share of social problems as well as its
intended good. Though the benefits of
progress are often realized in a very short
time, the social problems involved are
allowed to hang on for long periods. The
benefits are anticipated, praised and re-
membered, but the social problems are
denied and forgotten.
Perhaps the greatest technological ad-
vance of our day has been the advent and
growth of the mass production system. It
has given us much that would have been
practically impossible fifty years ago.
Progress breeds progress. Consider a few
of the changes that the mass production
of automobiles has caused. As engineers,
our first thoughts would probably be the
increased need for more and better roads,
better fuels, materials of construction, etc.
But progress breeds more than this. Mass
production brought the need for an in-
creased working force of unskilled labor,
and the resulting increase in urbanization
has presented problems which are not ac-
cepted and met; problems which often
come to our attention only by their ulti-
mate products. Thus juvenile delinquency
and immorality arc not an expression of
youth itself, but of the environment which
produced the youth.
Too many people have begun to accept
the myth that this country was built on
mass production and that its continuance
means the continued greatness of our na-
tion. What they have forgotten is that
since the beginning, our country has been
built by leaders. In the earliest days the
leaders were the family fathers, and their
existence depended upon the individual
aggressiveness and self-reliance of them-
selves. They were willing to risk much
in time and energy and were thankful to
gain a little more than mere existence.
The leaders advanced, and they brought
the nation forward with them. The years
preceding mass production were not use-
less, wasted years in which this country
stood waiting for some magical door to
open and a voice to proclaim that this is
the golden era. They were, rather, a
pregnant anticipation, a growing pre-
paredness for the advance to come. All
through the years there were leaders, and
when mass production began, the old and
new leaders combined to bring about the
most rapid period of change in our his-
tory. The automobile industry was not
built by the metal workers and the ma-
chinists, but the Fords, Olds, and Ket-
terings. They were men who possessed
the same individual aggressiveness and
self-reliance of the pioneer leaders, and
they, too, were pioneers.
And so mass production grew by leaps
and bounds and slowly but steadily so-
ciety fell farther and farther behind. The

Theory of the Column Formula
In the "theory of strength", the column
problem is a topic which has been attack-
ed from many angles. For the most part,
the formulas derived and the theories ex-
pounded have been fruitless to the design
engineer. The beam-column adds even
more confusion to the issue. In the field
of design, the various codes have set up
empirical forms so that the average engi-
neer could have a method of design.
In March of 1941 the ENGINEERING
JOURNAL published the paper entitled
"Columns Subjected to Uniformly Dis-
tributed Transverse Loads," by Prof. J. A.
Van den Broek. In this paper is found a
simple, rational approach to this problem
which yields an extremely usable design
formula.
This formula is based on the assump-
tion that a column with uniformly distri-
buted transverse loads has an elastic curve
which may be closely approximated by a

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


The equation does not hold at P = O. If
we were to try to design by such a form-
ula, the question is where to start. The
transcendental terms would be enough
trouble to discourage any design engineer
from using such a method.
The "Van den Broek Beam Formula"
has proved its point in simplicity. As for
accuracy, a discussion on this may be
found later in this report
Testing Theory
In order that one may obtain accuracy
in their testing, the rule to bear in mind
is, in essence, "simplicity." The greatest
problem to be dealt with in the testing of
a beam-column is simplicity in the load-
ing apparatus. Secondly, comes the prob-
lem of gauging.
The first problem in testing a column
■with uniformly distributed transverse load
is in applying this transverse load. Ob-
viously, the actual application of such a
load leads to such complications that it
has been rejected by the author in favor of
a method of approximating this load
through application of two unit loads.
The next problem faced is the axial
loading which can be attained directly by
mounting the ends of the specimen in
hemi-cylinders. (See Figure I) By allow-
ing accurately machined cylinders to roll
freely on carefully ground, parallel sur-
face plates, the axial load may be applied
by moving the plates toward one another.
Also, the fact that no eccentricity is in-
troduced when the cylinders roll is the
outstanding characteristic of this method.
(This idea may be directly attributed to
the work of J. A. Van den Broek and his
use of hemi-spherical heads for column
testing.)

Thus one has two independent vari-
ables to work with in application of this
loading to each specimen. These variables
are the load (Q) and the distance (a).
Having two variables it is possible to sat-
isfy two conditions. The conditions chosen
were: 1) the moment at the center should
be the same as the moment of the simu-
lated uniformly distributed load, and 2)
the deflection at the center should be like-
wise similar to the deflection produced
by the simulated loading. The reason
for this choice lies in the fact that the
center is the place of attainment of criti-
cal stress (or strain). The moment and
deflection of the center are the controll-

Application of the transverse loads—
Since a uniformly distributed transverse
load is symmetrical about the center of the
column, the two concentrated loads should
be equal and placed equidistant from
their respective ends of the specimen.

Given the length of the specimen and
using a radius of one inch in the cylinders
we can compute (a) for that length.
Knowing (a), the proper load (Q) can
then be computed from Equation I.
As a comparison of the properties of
this loading, its shear, moment, and elastic
curve diagrams are drawn to scale in
Figure IV for the ten inch specimen used.
These curves show the error in the elastic
curve to be not too great. Since the elastic
curve is a good approximation and the
moment at the center is defined to be
exactly the same as in the case of a uni-
formly distributed transverse loading, a
simple approximation of a complex load-
ing has been successfully attained.

Last summer the state of Maryland pre-
sented to the nation its largest single
public work—a forty million dollar
bridge that spans the Chesapeake Bay.
The Chesapeake Bay Bridge, as the new
bridge is called, is the largest continuous,
entirely over water, structure in the world.
The bridge is also the third longest bridge
in the world. (The two longer bridges
are the Oakland-Bay Bridge over San
Francisco Bay, which is 7 miles long, and
the 4.5 mile span over the James River in
Virginia.) The Chesapeake Bay Bridge-
is 4.35 miles long from shore to shore,
and with its approaches stretches over 7.5
miles. This new bridge brings closer to-
gether the eastern and western shores of
Maryland, from Kent Island to Sandy
Point near Annapolis.
BY
ROBERT CONSTANT, '55E
Preliminary work for the bridge was
started in January, 1949, and dredges
started pumping black ooze from the bot-
tom of the bay in November of that year.
The ribbon-snipping ceremonies com-
memorating the opening of the bridge
were held on July 30, 1952.
The Chesapeake Bridge, the only
bridge spanning the Chesapeake Bay, will
put an end to the ferries which have been
the only means of transportation across
the bay. It will cut crossing time from
the half hour required by the ferries—
often amounting to hours on busy sum-
mer weekends—to about ten minutes.
The traffic capacity of the modern, two-
lane bridge is 1500 vehicles per hour in
one direction. Tolls collected from mo-
torists using the bridge will finance the
project. Revenues collected for the month
of August, the first month that the bridge
was in operation, amounted to 5573,000.
It took 123 fabricated steel spans to
complete the entire project. These spans
range from 60 to 1600 feet—consisting
of beams, girders, simple trusses, canti-
lever trusses, and cable suspension bridge.
The diameter of the suspension bridge
cable is 14 inches and the height of the
tower is 354 feet above the bay surface.
The spans were built on barges and
then floated into place. They rest on re-
inforced concrete piers supported in steel
piles driven into the bottom of the bay.
The deepest steel piles penetrate to a
depth of 203 feet below the water surface.

born at Weston-super-Mare, England on
April 17, 1863, and died on June 5th,
1940, at the age of 77. His father was
police-surgeon at Wolverhampton and
Love attended the grammar school there
between 1874 and 1881. Apparently
Love maintained an attachment to his old
school for he later arranged to give an
annual mathematical prize at that school.
It appears that as a schoolboy, Love was
somewhat odd in character-—not an un-
common thing for mathematicians.
He entered St. John's College at Cam-
bridge in 1882. He was the second best
in Parts I and II of the Mathematical
Tripos Examinations in 1885. He then
held a fellowship in St. John's College
and was a college lecturer between 1886
and 1899. The year 1899 began a new
era in Love's career. He was appointed as
Seldian Professor at Oxford which posi-
tion he held until his death. During the
period 1899 to 1911, his increased lei-
sure allowed him to devote much of his
time to research activities in his chosen
subjects of elasticity, geodynamics, and
electrodynamics. During his lifetime,
numerous honors were bestowed upon
him, the most important being the Adams
Prize in Cambridge in 1911 for an essay
entitled "Some Problems in Geodynam-
ics" which was published the same year.
Other honors include the Royal Medal in
1909; De Morgan Medal of London
Mathematical Society in 1926; the Royal
Society's Sylvester Medal in 1937 for his
life-long devotion to mathematics; hon-
orary members of the Academy of Linci
and of the Institute of France.
In later years, he was in frail health
A. E. H. LOVE
although he was still active in lecturing
and attending to the university business.
Love was unmarried and through most of
his life, he was cared for by his sister,
Blanche. In a sense, this portion of
Love's life is very similar to that of J.
Willard Gibbs who was also unmarried
and was cared for by his sister.
* * *
Reference will generally be made to
Love for two outstanding contributions in
elasticity: the first discovery is what after-
ward became known as "Love waves" and
the second is his formulation of the
theory of shells which is known as
"Love's first approximation."
It is a classical result that any disturb-
ance in an elastic medium resolves itself
into the propagation of trains of com-
pressional and distortional waves in three
dimensions. But it is not immediately ob-
vious that there exists a mode of combin-
ation of such trains which results in the
propagation of a disturbance in two di-
mensions on the surface of a semi-infinite
elastic body. Such a form of wave was dis-
covered by Lord Rayleigh and bears his
name. Love showed that in a medium
consisting of a superficial layer of one
density and rigidity resting on a sub-
adjacent layer of a different density and
rigidity, there exists a new form of two-
dimensional waves decreasing in ampli-
tude exponentially with depth, propagat-
ingthemselves with a tangential disturb-
ance, transverse to the direction of propo-
gation, and depending for their existence
on the heterogeneity of the medium.
In this way, Love investigated the disper-
sion of such wave trains and application
of his methods in the hands of seis-
mologists has led to important informa-
tion about the crust of the earth. It
should be said that the essay on geodyn-
amics in which these investigations first
appeared has a completeness of mathe-
matical detail which makes it attractive
reading for all serious students of science.
His sentences come with the leisurely per-
fection of the great memoirs of the 18th
century.
It is of interest to note that Love's
work with regard to earthquakes was an-
ticipated by Lord Rayleigh in the follow-
ing quotation concerning "Rayleigh
waves": "It is not improbable that the
surface waves here investigated play an
important part in earthquakes and in the
collision of elastic solids. Diverging in
two dimensions only, they must acquire
a great distance from the source a con-
tinually increasing preponderance." It is
perhaps this statement from Rayleigh's
work that influenced the later investiga-
tions of Bromwich (1899) and Lamb
(1904) before the discovery of "Love-
waves."
It is well known that formulation of
the shell theory by the use of the general
equations of elasticity was first attempted
by Aron in 1874. Aron expressed the
geometry of the middle surface in terms
of Gaussian curvatures and adapted to the
problem the method which Clebsch had
used for plates (the classical theory of
plates presented in Clebsch's book).
Aron's work was further polished and
generalized by Love in 1888 who arrived
at the equations of motion and boundary

Whoops! What happened? The anxiety of the men is due to the fact that their
steel specimen is being stretched by the tensile testing machine in the Chem-
Met. lab. Since they have to find the elastic limit, the maximum load, and the
breaking shift point, nothing—absolutely nothing! must be wrong.
Another phase of the Chem-Met lab is welding. Acetylene welding, here being
done by William Glesner, can be a problem the first time. Lighting the torch,
keeping it lit, and being able to see enough through the very dark goggles to
weld a straight line are not the easiest jobs in the world for a beginner. The
welding shop, which has facilities for acetylene, arc, butt, and seam welding re-
places the old forge shop.

Inserts Protect Tapped Threads
In Copper Conductors
The TOCCO Division of the Ohio
Crankshaft Company in Cleveland now
reinforces holes tapped in copper con-
ductor plates and bus bars with stainless-
steel wire thread inserts. The higher
thread loading strengths obtained with
insert-protected threads permit secure cap
screw connections between electrical con-
ductors in the TOCCO line of induction
heating units.
In the past, high installation torque ex-
erted on cap screws stripped the unpro-
tected copper threads. Also, parts such as
induction blocks require frequent re-
moval from heating transformer outlets.
The frequent interchange of induction
blocks, to satisfy production requirements
for treating different size and shape parts,
increased the occurrence of stripped
threads in copper. In addition, the many
cycles of cap screw insertion and removal
subjected copper threads to an accelerated
wear rate.
Stainless-steel wire thread inserts rein-
force the copper "fish tails" projecting
through the transformer panel. Inserts
and inserting-tool are supplied by Heli-
Coil Corporation of Danbury, Connecti-
cut.
After considering various protective
means, TOCCO engineers specified heli-
cal wire thread inserts, manufactured by
Heli-Coil Corporation, Danbury, Conn.
as integral parts of the induction heating
station units. Each set of copper trans-
former outlet plates now has %-l6 wire
thread inserts in every tapped hole. Pro-
jecting through the ebony-asbestos trans-
former panels, these plate-sets have from
12 to 16 protected holes, depending on
the particular heating unit model.
In this manner, the interchangeable in-
duction blocks can be fastened securely
to the transformer outlet with complete
assurance of thread strength and per-
formance.
Insert protected threads in the panel-
outlet represent considerable cost savings
in that "down-time" for thread repair has
been eliminated. In addition, outlet-plate
replacement no longer is required because
the threads are now permanently protect-
ed from wear.
The success of insert use in copper
conductors led this manufacturer to search
for other possible applications. Copper
bus bars with insert-protected threads can
be fastened securely to assure a good elec-
trical connection.
Another application, still in the ex-
perimental state, involves the use of in-
serts to protect and reinforce threads
tapped in insulating such as Transite.
North American Aviation Builds a
'Baby' Reactor
The first atomic energy reactor to oper-
ate in California was revealed this sum-
mer when North American Aviation's
water boiler neutron source was demon-
strated at the company's Downey plant.
Designed and built by North Ameri-
can's Atomic Energy Research Depart-
ment under contract with the Atomic
Energy Commission, the "baby" reactor
is being used to further development of
reactors and associated projects.
While the water boiler reactor is quite
small in comparison with reactors for pro-
ducing fissionable materials or useful
power, from it may be obtained informa-
tion of value in designing improved re-
actors for various purposes. The water
boiler is a part of a facility for making
reactor physics measurements to enlarge
the basic information upon which re-
actor development is based. The water
boiler neutron source will supply the
neutrons, minute particles of matter,
needed for these measurements.
The reactor is generally similar in con-
struction and physical size to other low
power water boiler reactors in the United
States. A difference is that the very low
power of the reactor at North American,
less than one watt, makes a cooling sys-
tem unnecessary. A reactor of such small
power is not used as a producer of fission-
able materials.
The exterior of the reactor is shielded
by a housing of two-foot thick concrete
blocks each weighing 1,000 pounds,
forming a structure about the size of a
single car garage. The concrete surrounds
a cylindrical graphite reflector five feet in
diameter and six feet high, formed by
stacking graphite bars horizontally inside
a steel tank. The reflector surrounds the
reactor core, a stainless steel sphere one
foot in diameter. The production of
atomic energy takes place inside this
sphere which contains a Uranium 235 en-
riched uranyl nitrate solution. It is from
the nuclear fission of this material in a
water solution that the reactor derives
its power,—and its name "water boiler."
The rate of fission, the production of
atomic power, is controlled by a system of
control rods which can be moved hori-
zontally through the concrete and graph-
ite to the core. These rods, made of
cadmium, boron, and aluminum, have a
retarding effect upon the nuclear fission
inside the core. Depending upon their
nearness to the core, the rods can control
the fission from a "stop" to "wide open"
rate of reaction. The graphite reflector
"bounces back" neutrons which come
from the core. Any stray neutrons which
escape the reflector are trapped by the
concrete, and engineers working outside
the reactor are shielded from any harm-
ful effects of atomic radiation.
The water boiler type reactor is unique
in its safety features. Although the re-
actor is constructed to be completely con-
trollable by mechanical means, it has in-
herent features which contribute to its
safety. If the mechanical controls were
to fail, and a "run away" fission process
resulted, heat produced by the process
would raise the temperature of the water
solution sufficiently to stop power pro-
duction. At this point emergency con-
trol rods could be employed to restore the
reactor to a neutral condition.
Materials to be "bombarded" by neu-
trons and thus jnade radioactive can be
placed inside the core by rneans of a
"glory hole" which connects through a

Two engineers are required to put the
reactor into operation and bring it to the

needed to keep the reactor in operation,
while an additional engineer conducts the

American Aviation's Atomic Energy Re-
search Department measure the back-
ground radiation level around the water
boiler type atomic energy reactor.
Although the Atomic Energy Commis-
sion authorized North American to build
the water boiler primarily for reactor re-
search, associated secondary studies in
atomic energy technology can also be per-
formed with the aid of the reactor, with
applications to medicine, industry and
academic research.
North American is one of the largest
companies under contract to the Atomic
Energy Commission engaged in the de-
velopment and design of atomic energy
reactors for both military and peacetime
applications, including the production of
central station electrical power for public
use. The water boiler will provide an-
other research tool for company atomic
engineers to continue their work in these
fields.
Westinghouse Completes
Sound Laboratory
A "point of no return" for echoes has
been built into a new sound laboratory
by Westinghouse Electric Corporation.
More precisely called an anechoic cham-
ber, the room will enable research engi-
neers to study noise—its source, cause,
and measurement.
Dr. Patrick Conley, manager of acous-
tical research at Westinghouse Research
Laboratories, states, "elimination or re-
duction of noise in the present lines of
Westinghouse equipment is valued at
8 by 24 inches at its base and 34 inches
long. Wire mesh with 1/^ inch openings
encases each wedge to facilitate installa-
tion and protect the easily damaged filler.
A spring supported wire net is stretch-
ed from all four side walls several feet
above the wedges which cover the floor of
the chamber. This working platform will

close to half a million dollars every year
for each decibel of sound diminution."
The laboratory is located in a suburban
area of Pittsburgh, Pa., where the sur-
rounding noise level is quite low. Inside
the main building and surrounded by
masonry walls 12 inches thick, a 19 by 13
by 10 ft. room has had its walls, roof,
and floor completely covered with insu-
lating material shaped in the form of
wedges. These wedges are the very heart
of the anechoic chamber for it is their
shape, composition, size, and number that
determines the efficiency of the room.
Fabricated from glass wool, each wedge is
support equipment to be tested. Overhead,
necessary types of service lines are avail-
able to operate the various test pieces.
Since only the noise source plus a micro-
phonepickup will be inside the room
during test runs, all gauges and recording
devices are located on control panels in an
adjoining room.
In a so called "free sound field," such
as would exist at an altitude of 50 or 100
miles, sound waves would emanate from
a source in all directions and their inten-
sity would decrease as the inverse square
of the distance from the source. This

pace was too great, and the leaders in
social advance were too few. Today we
stand at a crossroads, and unless we as
engineers can join with others in society
and admit and accept our responsibilities,
the road will continue downward.
What has happened to the qualities of
leadership in every man that were so
necesary in our pioneer leaders? Again,
technology has done much to destroy
these important traits in man. Consider
briefly our advance in the realm of mod-
ern entertainment. With the multitude of
diversions that confront the public a cer-
tain cause for alarm is creeping in. True
enough, the mediums of radio, motion
pictures, and more recently television,
have brought much that is good to the
public. We can now see and hear people
and events that would be impractical or
even impossible otherwise. Music and
entertainment have been made more avail-
able to us by these findings. But along
with this benefit, a perhaps greater harm
has fallen amongst us, and we are un-
consciously accepting it without alarm.
Are we willing to admit and accept the
fact that with our increased source of en-
tertainment we are looking more and
more outside ourselves for our leader-
ship? If all our modern diversions were
taken from us, we would be bored—bored
by our very selves and our lack of self-
reliance and individual aggressiveness.
We have lost the knack of entertain-
ing ourselves. Is it also possible to lose
the power to think for ourselves, and lead
ourselves, and, eventually, govern our-
selves? The qualities of leadership are
giving way to the docile acceptance of
mere existence.
With the increased need for unskilled
workers, it was inevitable that they should
reach a position of no small importance
in our society. Through the labor unions,
their power is sometimes felt by the na-
tion as a whole. The little man has gained
power, but in doing so, he has given over
his individuality to the group. He has
gained much, but again at the loss of his
individuality and self-reliance. A large-
part of the organizers and leaders of
unions today do not come from the shops
themselves, but from outside sources.
How can the future union leaders rise
from such a group, when the qualities
that have always meant leadership are
being sacrificed? In short, can not these
properties be included in a life that tech-
nology has built, but in which man must
live? I believe they can.
There can be no sensational revolution
which will erase the blot against society
that has grown along with technology.
There is no single law or decree or re-
form that can suddenly bring society into
harmony with fact. Only by working on
the smallest scale, everywhere at once, can
there be any definite, lasting change in
our society. Engineers are widely spread
across the country and there are those
who argue that since engineers are in
some respects responsible for conditions,
they should be the group to correct them.
It is time wasted to argue as to who or
what has caused our present situation.
Progress cannot be held back in a free-
thinking nation in a world of keen com-
petition. Let us then accept the situation
as it is and for what it is, and see what
we as engineers can do to improve it.
As students in college, we are apt to
forget it is a rare privilege. Less than ten
percent of our people ever get the chance
we have today. College life is largely an
atmosphere that is almost unique, for in
few other places in our society will you
find that prejudice and discrimination are
so minimized. It is in this atmosphere
that we are developing as engineering stu-
dents, but more important, as members of
society.
After graduation, we will begin a new
life in which the theory and observation
of our college life will take on new sig-
nificance and utility. We will be anxious
to earn the designation "engineer" and to
apply ourselves in our particular fields. In
our work, the public looks to us, if only
indirectly, with faith that what we de-
sign or build or produce is safe to use,
and that their money is well spent. This
faith of the public is in a sense a respon-
sibility to see that the products are the
best. "Good enough" can never pass for
what is right.
In taking up our work in engineering,
most of us will be moving to a new loca-
tion. We will become a part of a com-
munity, and, in most cases, begin to raise
families. It is important that we realize
that we are never just engineers, or hus-
bands, or fathers, but on a broader scale
members of a community that constitutes
the society in which we live. Anything
that we can do to aid the community aids
ourselves, directly and indirectly, for any
improvement in conditions has its effect
on the whole community. What are these
conditions, and how can they be im-
proved?
It has already been mentioned that the
traits that have produced leaders in the
past are dying out. It should therefore be
important to stimulate these traits of self-
reliance and individual aggressiveness as
well as the co-operative spirit that has
made our industrial and economic struc-
ture possible. Many opportunities present
themselves in community life. An active
interest in the school system will be a nat-
ural responsibility for those of us who
will one day be sending our own children
to these schools. Education has long been
pointed to as one of the most powerful
weapons against social downfall. By par-
ticipation in such organizations as the
Parent-Teacher Association, the problems
of individual children can be realized by
their parents. Through the PTA the
school can be encouraged to teach charac-
ter building. In some locals, there are in-
sufficient funds for the provision of spec-
ial equipment, such as motion picture pro-
jectors and educational films, and through
their fund-raising ventures the PTA has
often made such equipment available. In
some instances the need is very great, and
a frank evaluation of the method of ob-
taining operating expenses for the schools
deserves the attention of every good citi-
zen.
In this manner, the engineer-citizen
will find that active awareness of, if not
actual participation in local government
is a responsibility not to be taken lightly.
Civic pride and civic improvement are
more than just words. In a community
where every citizen takes pride in the ap-
pearance and functioning of his town
there will be civic improvement. Whether
we are ready to admit it or not, the com-
munity can never ignore a part of itself
and operate efficiently. The problems of
the minority can become the stumbling
block of the community. Financial insta-
bility, crowded housing conditions, poor
family relations; these problems of a rela-
tively few can produce effects upon the
community that are far-reaching and ter-
rible in their impact. Juvenile delinquency
has often been attributed to conditions
such as these. It is much better to try to
prevent or remove conditions than to
combat a problem like juvenile delin-
quency. To ignore such conditions is to

deny social responsibility.
Much can be done to improve these
conditions in many ways. An increase in
the productive capacity of your employer
will often mean jobs and a chance for
stable income for more people. People
will be needed in construction and later
in operation or maintenance. Through
civic government, aid can be given to
those who cannot help themselves, and by
careful planning, such such as city zoning
ordinances, housing conditions can be im-
proved. In the realm of improved family
relations, perhaps the church is best quali-
fied to give assistance.An active mem-
bership in the church of his choice can be
a real benefit to the engineer and to the
community as well. The philosophy of
the church has changed a great deal in
the past few decades. The rise of such
activities as church basketball leagues has
given youth a good outlet for its energy.
The church has been the foundation of
our morals, and its decay has always been
closely followed by moral problems. By
supporting the church and encouraging it
to expand its aid to the community, the
engineer is helping to fulfill his social re-
sponsibilities.
There are other community organiza-
tions which can aid immeasurably in the
development of youth towards self-re-
liant citizens. Such organizations as the
Lions, Optimists, Kiwanis, Rotary, Ma-
sons, and Knights of Columbus are all
helping the community. Either active or
financial support of organizations such as
these is a privilege that aids in fulfilling
our responsibilities. Much of what has
been said has been aimed at improving
youth, for after all, they will be the
citizens of tomorrow. But we cannot
ignore the people today who are growing
old in a society in which they find ad-
justment increasingly difficult. To do so
would be shunning the truth. In some
locales, much has been done for adults
through recreation and education pro-
grams in night classes carried on in the
public schools. The growth of family
participation in recreation and learning
can help to once again bind the family
together as the unit of our social struc-
ture.
In viewing the possible means of ful-
filling our social responsibilities, it is im-
portant not to lose sight of the fact that
the most important responsibility is to
our own families. It is possible to do so
much for others that we are blind to our
own. Of our responsibilities in the home,
I would single out as the most important
the necessity of teaching children their
responsibilities, not only to others, but
to themselves as well.
All responsibility is not, however, of a
strictly local or community nature. But if
engineers and other responsible citizens
take care of the local problems all over
the country, a tremendous advance is in
prospect. Some problems are of a nation-
wide character and could be dealt with if
engineers were organized in a nation-
wide group. In reality, engineers are thus
organized through their professional so-
cieties, and it is conceivable that some
social problems could be handled if these
groups of individuals will accept the re-
sponsibility. In some cases the develop-
ment of a process or machine brings
about real and bitter hardship for certain
groups of people. A good example is
the number of share-croppers who actu-
ally starved to death when modern farm
machinery took their jobs from them. The
overall result of the use of such ma-
chinery has been good, but it is regret-
able that such ill effects were an imme-
diate result. This could possibly be avoid-
ed in the future if engineers will think
ahead of their developments and try to
anticipate the changes and social prob-
lems that may result. Through their
national organizations they may then be
able to present the problem where it will
do the most good, and suggest possible
solutions.
The social responsibilities of an engi-
neer are those of any good citizen. As
engineers, we will have been trained in a
college atmosphere and have received a
broader education both scholastically and
in living. We should be willing and able
to accept a larger share of social respon-
sibility. It seems quite natural that such
professional men as lawyers, doctors, and
teachers should accept social responsibility
and the mase for engineers should be no
different. As professional men living and
working in a community their responsi-
bility is all around them. But only by ac-
tive awareness of community life and par-
ticipation in community affairs can these
responsibilities be met.
Just as the employer and the public
depend upon the engineer in his work,
the community should be able to depend
upon his active interest in social problems.
Technology has created problems more
rapidly than society can handle them.
People are unable to adjust as quickly
mentally and morally as they are physi-
cally to a physically changing world.
Progress need not be at someone's per-
sonal expense.
The importance of reviving the quali-
ties of leadership and individuality are
essential to social improvement. It should
be the duty of the engineer to make real
to society the combined need for individ-
uality as well as co-operative action. It
is important to insure that the future
will produce leaders and not slaves in
our society.
By participation in community groups
and national profesional organizations
the engineer can do much to bring social
problems into the open where they can be
freely admitted and finally eliminated.
As engineering students, we should
realize now the responsibilities of tomor-
row by accepting the responsibilities of
today.
What then is an engineer? An engi-
neer is a person highly trained in the
theory and skills necessary for produc-
tion. By realizing and accepting his so-
cial responsibilities he can be more cer-
tain that he is producing for the lasting
good of society.

would, of course, preclude the presence
of any kind of magnitude of background
noise. Since there would be no surround-
ing walls or obstacles in this "free field,"
no reflections of sound would occur—
hence no echoes. These are the physical
factors that Westinghouse engineers have
endeavored to build into their anechoic
chamber.
The cjuiet site location of the lab and
the type of wall construction have pro-
duced a very depressed ambient sound
level. The design of the wedges them-
selves absorbs and prevents reflection of
sound waves. According to Dr. Conley, a
sound level within the room of 10 to 15
decibels is anticipated. In comparison, a
residential neighborhood at night has a
noise level of 25 to 30 decibels.
One of the problems that will be
studied in the new sound laboratory will
be that of determining a standard method
of measuring noise. Although certain
limits of sound emanation for each type
of electrical equipment are specified by
the National Electrical Manufacturers
Association, the method of measuring
noise throughout industry varies widely.
This has led to confusion and in some
cases rather large unnecessary expendi-
tures .
Other Investigatians will lead to sound
reduction in many types of Westinghouse
cquipjtfeht including ballasts in fluores-
cent lighting fixtures, transformers, re-
frigerators, vacuum cleaners, air condi-
tioning units, speakers for home radios,
and jet engine test cells. •
Dr. Conley emphasized .that the sound
study program will^ nojt Jje.a rapid one
with solutions to present noise problems
as their immediate goal. "We must first",
he said, "understand thoroughly the de-
tailed causes of the various sounds, their
means of propagation and radiation, and
their psychoacoustic effects—the'effects on
the human ear of sound level and fre-
quency. With these problems solved,
various apparatus noises can be reduced
or eliminated more easily."
GM Keeps Tabs on the Sun
General Motors Research Laboratories
Psysics-Instrumentation Department is
testing a %'ery sensitive spectroheliometcr
for use in a basic study of paint failures.
This apparatus measures the distribu-
tion of the sun's energy, the energy's va-
riation with the time of day and season
and the intensity of the various parts of
the sun's spectrum or rays. A special
mount keeps the instrument constantly
pointing toward the sun.
All data gathered by the spectrohelio-
metcr are recorded automatically and the
information is correlated with the weath-
ering of automotive paint and finish
samples on outdoor exposure racks.
Eventually the instrument will be sent to
Miami, Fla., where the GM Research
General Chemistry Department maintains
a test field to weather all types of automo-
tive finishes. It will aid researchers to
determine which parts of the sun's rays
are most injurious to finishes.

New Air Filter Developed for
Mine Safety
Developed originally to remove radio-
active contamination from air exhausted
during atomic energy plant operations, a
new type of air filter has now been made
available for general industrial, institu-
tional and laboratory use by Mine Safety
Appliance Company.
Called the Ultra-Aire Space Filter,
each filter is reported to be tested against
fine chemical smoke and is certified to be
at least 99.95% efficient against particles
as small as 0.3 micron (about 12/
1,000,000th of an inch) in diameter. In
practice, the filter removes particles as
finely divided as tobacco smoke, particles
of which range from .05 to .1 of a
micron.
Simple in design and construction, the
Ultra-Aire filter offers 46,000 square in-
ches of filter media in the 1000 CFM size,
and is available in air flow sizes of 50,
500 and 1000 CFM. Its effective service
fife, when protected by a roughing filter,
is about a year and a half.
The new filter is said to have many
applications where toxic and radioactive
particles arc a threat to health or produc-
tion processes. In hospitals, it safeguards
against bacteria and some virus when they
are air-borne in operating rooms, isola-
tion wards, and experimental laboratories.
Producers of pharmaceuticals are told the
filter prevents product contamination in
processes where air conditioning is vital
to manufacturing.
It can be made a part of an air condi-
tioning system, either in the intake or
exhaust.
The Ultra-Aire can eliminate radioac-
tive contamination of photographic film
and chemicals and is valuable to film
manufacturers and processors. Placed in
laboratory ventilation hoods, it safe-
guards workers in areas where toxic par-
ticulate matter is present.
Food processing plants can put the
Ultra-Aire filter to work to trap spores
which might cause spoilage and to elimin-
ate bacterial contamination of food
products. It can also be designed into
bomb shelters to protect against radioac-
tive airborne hazards.
Dimming of Fluorescent. Lamps
To Increase Their Versatility
A practical system for dimming fluor-
escent lamps smoothly and efficiently—
something the lighting industry has been
striving for since the inception of fluores-
cent lighting—was announced and dem-
onstrated at the annual technical confer-
ence of the Illuminating Engineering
Society here today.
By means of the new light control sys-
tem, developed by General Electric light-
ing engineers at Nela Park, in Cleveland,
the brightness of fluorescent lamps can
be controlled merely with the turn of a
knob, just as smoothly and easily as in-
candescent lamps have been dimmed or
brightened in the past.
The new system greatly increases the
flexibility of fluorescent lamps and the
range of uses to which they can be put,
according to G-E engineers John H.
Campbell and Harry E. Schultz, who de-
signed the circuit making the control sys-
tem possible.
The engineers expect the dimming
feature to find favor in such a variety of
places as theaters, auditoriums, schools,
display rooms, stores, hotels, night clubs,
restaurants, television studios, show win-

dows, signs, and in many other places.
This system consists of a dimming con-
trol unit and especially designed matching
ballast. Although the equipment is still
in the design stage, early release for pro-
duction is anticipated.
General Electric's Specialty Transform-
er and Ballast Department will produce
the control system. It will be available
for use with either the conventional 40-
watt pre-heat type of lamp, or with the
new 40-watt "Rapid Start" fluorescent
lamps. Two sizes of controls will be
made, one operating up to eight lamps,
and the other up to 35 lamps.
By means of a circuit which maintains
the starting voltage but changes the cur-
rent to affect the light output, fluores-
cent lamps can be turned on instantly
at any point in the dimming range. By
twisting a knob, the lamps may be
dimmed from maximum brightness until
they produce practically no light at all,
and then may be brightened in the same-
manner.
Although the light control system will
be used effectively in general lighting
applications, it is expected to be especially
in demand to create special lighting ef-
fects, particularly with colored fluorescent
lamps.
Campbell and Schultz explain that al-
though colored fluorescents are much
more efficient than filament lamps, their
use in the past has been limited, because
their brightness could not be regulated
effectively. Fluorescent lamps produce
more than three times the white light, and
up to 25 times the amount of colored
light, provided by incandescent lamps of
the same wattage.
The G-E engineers also pointed out
that fluorescent lamps maintain their orig-
inal color during the dimming process,
while the light of filament lamps turns
increasingly red.
Drilling of Curved Holes
A new method has been developed for
drilling holes along an arc. Using this
method—an electric arc method—holes
of a diameter larger than 0.040-inch have
been drilled in cast iron along an arc of
a radius from about 1 to 4 inches. The
electric arc method was developed in
order to place thermocouple junctions in-
side a casting at a point not accessible by
a single straight hole.
The curved hole drilling device uses
the electrical circuit and cooling fluid of a
disintegrating machine, in this instance
the Thomas Metal Master manufactured
by the Clinton Machine Company. These
machines remove metal in the hole to be
drilled by electric arcing and subsequent
quenching of the molten metal by a cool-
ing fluid passed through the center of the
hole drilling electrode. The electrode is
generally a circular tube; however, any
shape hole can be drilled by using tri-
angular, square or other shaped elec-
trodes. The art at the electrode tip is
produced by vibrating the electrode.
In the Thomas Metal Master, the cur-
rent that flows when the electrode makes
contact with the work piece is also the
current used to break the contact between
the electrode and work piece. This is done
by conducting the electrode current
through a coil so located that it lifts the
shaft the electrode is mounted on each
time the circuit is closed. When the cir-
cuit is opened, the magnetic pull ceases,
and electrical contact is made again as
the spring loaded shaft returns the elec-
trode to the drilling position.
In the curved hole drilling rig it is
necessary to vibrate the electrode along
the path of its arc and, therefore, the
straight line vibration motion of conven-
tional disintegrating machines is unsatis-
factory. The curved hole apparatus uses
a separate vibrator and depends on the
disintegrating machine only for its cool-
ant flow and electric current for arcing.

Fig. I. Drill Rig for drilling holes along
a circular arc. Electrode removed.
When drilling a hole along the path of
an arc, it is necessary thatt he electrode*
body follow the hole made by the tip.
Arcs and helices are typical of the curves
that can be drilled. Electrodes of 0.050 to
0.075-inches have been used to drill holes
that have radii of about 2y2 inches and
an arc length up to 2-inches.
The curved hole drilling device is
shown in Fig. 1. To drill a curved hole
with it, the procedure is as follows:
First, electrode A—one that has been
bent along the arc of the desired radius—
is inserted in holder B.
Second, holder B is positioned on shaft
C so the center of the electrode follows
the proper arc as the shaft pivots around
D.
Third, electrode A is brought into con-
tact with the work piece and the current
turned on.

This is a cutaway view of a curved hole
that was drilled by means of a new
technique developed by the Clinton Ma-
chine Company.
Fourth, the vibrating mechanism that
makes and breaks electrode contact with
the work piece, consists of electromagnet
E supported on brass tube F that is turn
is fastened to shaft C. There is a steel
weight inside the brass tube that can
slide freely.
As the hole is being drilled, the electro-
magnet is energized while the electrode
is in contact with the work piece. During
this interval, the steel weight is acceler-
ated to the top of the brass tube with
enough force to raise the whole assembly.
This breaks electrode contact with the
work piece and simultaneously cuts off
the flow of current to the electromagnet.
The steel weight drops to the bottom of
the brass tube as the entire assembly
moves downward and the electrode again
makes contact with the work piece. This
cycle is repeated until the hole is the re-
quired depth.
During the drilling operation, the am-
plitude of vibration and the force avail-

a The geometry of the system.
b The loads: transverse and axial.
c The stress at the center of the speci-
men of the compression side.
This point is shown best in the general
procedure of running a test on a speci-
men. This information plus the cross sec-
tional dimensions of the bar complete re-
quirement a. The transverse loads are ap-
plied first to an arbitrary, simulated uni-
formly distributed transverse load. Then
the axial load is applied and increased
until the stress at the center of the column
reaches the elastic limit stress. The axial
load is then read, as it is the value (P)
for the corresponding value of (lew) in
Formula II. By this method the author has
tested a series of specimens of varied
lengths in order to check the "Van den
Broek Beam-Column Formula." Thus, in
the data following in this paper, the most
accurately and most carefully found values
will be those which are directly connected
with this procedure.
The only other data included in this
report is the transverse deflection of the
center of the column. The importance of
this quantity is that knowing this quan-
tity and the loads, the stress at the
center of the column may be computed
and used as a check on the strain indica-
tor readings at this point. (The data may

(Continued from page 15)
also be used to check the restraint in the
testing heads.) Neither of the computa-
tions has as yet seemed necessary so these
computations have been left out of this
report.
Procedural Methods and Equipment
For the most part, the equipment used
in tests on beam-columns must be rather
specialized to fulfill the requirements of
this type of testing. From this standpoint
the author was faced with the problem of
building equipment for these tests which
was not available. The choice of equip-
ment in this experimentation is limited by
many factors in order that accurate data
might be taken over a great range of
lengths of specimens. The equipment
chosen for such tests also defines the pos-
sible procedural methods of testing. Con-
sequently, many ideas for ease in con-
struction of equipment were overridden
by those which attained simplicity in the
procedure of testing.
The heads and surface plates were
given first consideration in equipment de-
sign. Since the specimens to be tested
were 5/16 inch square bar stock varying
from 5 in. to 18 in. (//i 55 to 200) in
length, the hemicylindrical heads were
built from 2 in. diameter cold rolled steel.
The determining factors in this choice
were from errors in axial load due to the
weight of the upper head (approximately
2 pounds) and the solution of the equa-
tion between a, / and r equation II).
It should be noted that if (/ is small
and (r) becomes sufficiently large,
the only values for (a) become imag-
inary in this system. It must be de-
fined that (2a) must be less than or equal
to (/), and (a) greater than zero to have
a physically possible system. The length
of the head cylinders was then chosen
at 4 inches in order that under the high-
est axial loads (3900 pounds) the de-
formation in the heads would be suffi-
ciently small as to allow the heads to roll
freely. Also as an aid to freedom in
rolling, the heads and surface plates
were ground to within ± .0002 inch tol-
erances. The 4 inch length of the heads
was also sufficient to aid in ease of align-
ment of the heads on the surface plates.
Next, the balancing of the transverse
loads between the heads and surface
plates was considered. It was decided to
use 1/16 in. aircraft cables stretched be-
tween the end block on the surface plates
to the heads. A groove was cut in the
heads in order that the cable could lie
between the heads and the surface plates
without impairing the rolling freedom of
the heads. This feature made it possible
to apply the transverse loads without ap-
plying any axial load. This fact is rather
important in getting correct zeros during
the testing. A total of four of these
cables were used, one to each end of each
of the heads.
The upper surface plate was then bolt-
ed to the machine and shimmed such that
the ground surfaces of the plates were
parallel. The bottom was not firmly at-
tached, but pegged in place with one peg.
This peg was ample to support the shear
between the surface plate and the
machine, but left it free to rotate. This
made it possible to eliminate the possi-
bility of torsion in the specimen during
the tests. A slot was cut lengthwise in
the head y2 inch deep and exactly 5/16
inches wide. Jaws were mounted in these
slots which would hold the specimen in
place. This proved to be a very satisfac-
tory arrangement. The jaws held the
specimen from buckling sideways, and the
slot insured against eccentricities in the
axial loads.
The heads functioned properly
throughout the tests. The only pos-
sible criticism is that the cables stretched
slightly upon application of the trans-
verse loads. No other errors were intro-
duced by them.
The next problem faced was the appli-
cation of the transverse loads. It was
found that by building a simple pair of
clamps, using pointed thumb screws for
bearing surfaces, the load could be ap-
plied to points on the specimen which
were center punched to insure against
slippage. These punch marks were ap-
plied on the center line of the specimen
at a distance (a) from the ends. Cables
were attached to the clamps and were run
over ball-bearing sheaves. Calibrated
weights were thereon applied to produce
any desired transverse loading. These also
functioned properly throughout the test-
ing, and errors due to them were found
negligible.
An SR-4 strain gauge was used to meas-
ure the strain at the center of the speci-
men. This type of gauge proved its
worth in handling and accuracy of opera-
tion. Dial gauges, measuring to .001

A MILLION TONS A YEAR...
That's America's production of nails ... in an almost
endless variety of types and sizes.
Today, a nail machine makes hundreds of accu-
rately pointed and headed nails per minute . . . more
than a week's production for a Colonial family in the
days when crude iron nails were hammered out by
hand.
WHAT MADE IT POSSIBLE?...
Modern metallurgy and manufacturing techniques
are responsible for America's tremendous yearly pro-
duction of nails. Today's steel nails are far tougher
and more economical than their Colonial counter-
part. New functional designs and special finishes have
been created . . . other metals put to use. And re-
search now promises nails with even greater holding
power.
AMERICA WORKS THAT WAY...
Progress and growth demand a ceaseless search for
new ways to improve product quality ... to extend
utility ... to increase output... to lower costs. That
is why management relies on the constant flow of
information available through America's all-seeing,
all-hearing and reporting Inter-Communications
System.
THE AMERICAN INTER-COM SYSTEM...
Complete communication is the function, the unique
contribution of the American business press ... a
great group of specially edited magazines devoted to
the specialized work areas of men who want to
manage better, design better, manufacture better,
research better, sell better, buy better.
COMMUNICATION IS OUR BUSINESS...
The McGraw-Hill publications are a part of this
American Inter-Communications System.
As publishers, we know the consuming insistence
of editors on analyzing, interpreting and reporting
worthwhile ideas. We know that businessmen, in
order to keep abreast of their jobs, subscribe to—pay
for—McGraw-Hill magazines edited for their specific
business interest . . . for the editorial pages tell
"how" and the advertising pages tell "with what."
A CAREER FOR YOU...
To a few 1953 engineering graduates, "McGraw-
Hill" will mean "writing" as well as "reading."
Spurred by experience on college magazines, or
broadened by work in industry, these men will join
those of earlier classes who are now McGraw-Hill
engineering editors.

to warrant their use in anything but a
check of other data.
General Procedure—Since the reader is
now familiar with the equipment used, a
detailed outline on actual procedure
should be inserted here to give a more
rounded picture of actually how the data
was taken.
in order to check the maximum compres-
sive strain and have the dial gauges func-
tion correctly, the column had to buckle
away from the gauges. In all specimens
this buckling was correctly predicted.
2. After applying the strain gauge and
punch marks, the specimen was placed in
the heads and aligned. This aligning in-
cluded a three dimensional check of all
parts directly connected to the specimen.
An axial load of approximately 500
pounds was then applied to insure the
proper seating of the specimen in thc-
head.
3. The loading arm of the testing ma-
chine was then raised so that the axial
load was assuredly zero and the zero
strain reading was taken. The loading
arm was then moved down until the point
of initial application of axial load could
be found in the first movement of th:.
strain indicator. At this point all gauges
were set at and assumed zero. The trans-
verse load was then added and the load-
ing scale of the test machine then zeroed
so as to account for these transverse loads.
This accounts for the proper zero of all
gauges.
4. The axial load was then applied
until the critical stress was reached. At
this time all gauges and loads were read
and recorded.
5. All loads were removed and all
gauges were again read to check the zero.
This completes the test run for a single
point shown on Figure V.
Data
The purpose in the taking of data is to
give a check to the "Van den Broek
Beam-Column Formula." To do this one
would wish to get sufficient data over a
large range of /, i values and for a repre-
sentative number of transverse loadings
for each l/'i chosen. Also preferable
would be the choice of some parameter
such that these points would form curves
on an axial load vs. l/\ plot.
If Q,.,. is the maximum transverse load
which a single specimen can carry with
zero axial load, and Q is the transverse
load we are going to apply, then let a be
defined as the ratio of the two, or Q..'Q,.r.
As an example, for a specimen 10 inches
long, the maximum transverse load it can
carry was found to be 39.35 pounds (or
Qcr = 39.35). Now, in choosing the
transverse loads we would apply to the

here somewhere
about laying
an egg...
O
nce upon A time there were two farmers.
Each had a hen that laid 20 eggs a month.
Both farmers liked eggs, so one ate his. But
the other did without, and put his eggs in an
incubator which he bought by borrowing money.
In no time he had 200 chickens from his one.
A shocking profit! (Before taxes.)
He sold some to pay down the loan on his
incubator; he ate some as a reward for all his
labor in raising the brood. And he sold a good
many to pay his income tax.
He still had some left. Profit.
So the farmer who had eaten all his eggs got
a law passed. The neighbors divided up the
chicken-raising-farmer's "profits" and ate them.
After all, they said, he had more than he needed,
and they were hungry.
So, of course, the farmer wasn't going to raise
any more chickens just to have them taken away
from him; he ate his eggs, too.
In due time both the farmers' original hens
died of old age, and then there weren't any eggs
for anybody. No chickens either.
The neighbors were quite sure it was some-
how the chicken raiser's fault.
Did the farmer, who used to eat all his
eggs, enjoy his now-eggless meals any more
for realizing that the farmer next door wasn't
enjoying any chicken?

Drilling speeds are quite slow, usually
only in the order of %-inch per hour.
The hole size varies from about 0.093-
inch near the entrance to 0.O78-inch
near the end. This tapering is apparently
unavoidable in any hole drilled by this
disintegrating method.
Westinghouse Autopilot Used on

The first automatic pilot with unlimited

F-94C Starfire jet warplane that the Lock-
heed Aircraft Corporation announced re-
cently. It was developed by the West-
IN THE NEWS
(Continued from page .12)
inghouse Electric Corporation in coopera-
tion with the Air Material Command's
Armament Laboratory, Control Equip-
ment Branch. Manufactured by Westing-
house's Air-Arm Division, the automatic
pilot was described by Dr. Clinton R.
Hanna, associate director of the West-
inghouse Research Laboratories, as utiliz-
ing three "non-tumbling" gyroscopes that
are locked to the plane.
"These gyroscopes, spinning at 12,000
rpm, follow the plane's movements with-
out any possibility of tumbling," the
Westinghouse scientist said. "They differ
in this respect from the ordinary 'position'
gyro that is not locked to the plane and
hence stubbornly resists any effort to
change its direction of motion. As a re-
sult, former gyros were senstive only to
changes in angle of the plane, whereas
the new autopilot equipped with 'rate"
gyros responds to the rate at which such
changes take place."
Virtual finger-tip control, consisting of
a single control know, is provided by
the flight controller of the autopilot. For
normal flying, the autopilot is arranged
for completely coordinated flight. To
climb, the pilot simply pulls the knob
back and the plane climbs at a constant
rate, regardless of external conditions.
To turn, he rotates the know either right
or left, the rate of turn depending on thc
amount the knob is turned, and the cor-
rect bank angle being automatically set.
For combat tactics, the pilot switches
the autopilot to a stage of complete man-
euverability. Dr. Hanna said that the
control reacts to the pilot's signal in less
than one fifteenth of a second. He pointed
out that at the high speed of modern
planes, considerable force is required to
move control surfaces such as elevators,
ailerons, and rudder. To aid the pilot in
manual flight, hydraulic controls multi-
ply the pilot's efforts some 15 times and
convey it to the control surfaces.
The autopilot works through this same
system in automatically piloting the air-
craft. It is tied into the plane's radar and
instrument landing system, helping it to
track enemy targets automatically and to
land in bad weather.

When the country's largest railroad
loudspeaker system was pIanned in lhe Baltimore
and Ohio's yards near Chicago, the choice of cable to be
used was a key factor. With 37 miles of underground
cable involved, subsequent maintenance costs could con-
ceivably be a major item if any but the best cable were
to be used.
Okonite cable was chosen for this job because of its
superior rubber insulation and the resistance of its
Okoprene sheath to alkalis, acids, oils and other corrosive
substances encountered in railroad yard installations. To-
day, 197 two-way loudspeakers, 50 paging speaker*, a
complete telephone and printing telegraph system, and an

So different in other ways, the

about scoring and cutting rule steel
Some examptct of the many shapes of bends needed
Scoring and cutting rule steel is a cold-rolled
specialty«8teel for use in preparing dies for cutting
paper, leather, rubber and other materials.
It is a pre-tempered product manufactured by
skilled workmen, using precision rolling and hard-
ening equipment, to close limits for chemistry,
grain size and hardness. This product must also be
capable of meeting intricate bend requirements in
the hardened and tempered condition.
This specialty is furnished with round edges and
in coil form to the rule manufacturer who grinds
the edges — the one edge square and the other to a
knife edge as well as cutting the material into de-
sired lengths. This is sold to a die-maker who bends
the rule to the required shape. This is then the
nucleus of a pre-hardened die, which when properly
brazed and supported is used to cut out material for
display cards — aircraft parts — pocketbooks —
wallets — gloves — gaskets — washers.

sentative a's in the computation of the
Q's to be used for each specimen, we
find for each //i value wc have for

plot. This was the method used in plot-
ting Figure V.
The o = 0 curve, or PCT values—In the
procedure of checking the "Van den Broek
Beam-Column Formula" we are actually
interested in checking this formula for
values of a not zero. In setting up the
test method used, a positive check on
values and equipment is certainly the
dream of every student of research. In
this experiment it is possible to do this by
merely checking each specimen for maxi-
mum axial load at a = 0 (or no trans-
verse loading). It can be readily seen
that since Euler's value, or the crushing
load are the most critical values attainable
in column analysis, the errors in the
maximum axial load attainable for any
one specimen would be greater at a = 0
than for any other value of a. Thus for
any one specimen we may check to see
our maximum error due to a crooked
specimen or alignment errors simply by
looking at o = 0. The theoretical values
of this point have already been well es-
tablished as proven theory. These points
have been included in the plots for this
reason and should visually show the
reader a good and simple check of the set
up used.
One other set of data has been taken
in which exactly the same methods as be-
fore were used except that the axial load
was added in increments. Readings were
taken following the application of each
increment. This procedure was carried
out on a specimen of 18 inches in length.
Discussion of Errors
Theory—The "Van den Broek Beam-
Column Formula" has been shown to be
in error only due to the assumption of a
sinecurve "elastic curve." This error is
shown to be small in his approach on er-
rors in his paper of March 1941. The pur-
pose of this paper is to show them to be
small by experimental data. Yet, Figure V
shows small errors between theoretical and
experimental from //i = 55 to l/i = 1.15.
This is due to the fact that in plotting
this data no corrections have been made
for any error introduced due to differences
between the physical values found in the
COLUMN TESTING
(Continued from page 40)
data and the theoretical values. This was
done so that the reader could have an
honest comparison of this experimental
equipment as compared to the theory the
author has tried to represent.
It may be noted that as the l/i becomes
smaller the error increases. This is due
to the errors in simulating a uniformly
distributed transverse load with two unit
loads. It can be seen that as the lengths
become smaller, the ratio of (r) (the
radius of the head) to (a) becomes in-
creasingly larger. Most of the error in the
simulated elastic curve is due to the (rQ)
end moment on the specimen. Therefore,
Here a method might be suggested
whereby a design engineer might find a
similar column with uniformly distributed
transverse loadings. A simple example
would be a beam column with a concen-
trated load at the center. By assuming
the elastic curve to be sinusoidal, an an-
alysis might be done to find an equivalent
uniformly distributed transverse load.
This could be substituted into the Van
den Broek formula with results within
5 to 15 percent. Present design criteria
often come far from this range by their
empirical methods. A set of tabular
forms might easily be set up to carry
the error in the elastic curve is larger for
low l/i's.
The author has computed a few of
these errors for the shorter specimens and
has found that these errors approximately
would account for the errors shown in
Figure V.
This shows that the errors shown in
Figure V are not errors in the "Van den
Broek Formula", but errors in the testing
performed to verify the theory.
Conclusions
The results of the testing as well as
Prof. Van den Broek's own analysis of
his theory in his paper show the errors of
his beam-column formula to be small
enough to be negligible for the uses of a
design engineer. Its practicability has also
been shown in this paper as compared to
the usual or classic criteria.

a much more preferable method if car-
ried out properly.

■ *^ far M.E.'
Du Font's manufacturing side offers opportunity to mechanical engineers
The young mechanical engineer in-
terested in production finds plenty
of opportunity at Du Pont. His skills
are in great demand because so many
of this Company's products are made
in equipment which must operate
continuously on automatic controls.
More than half of Du Pont's M .E. 's
are currently engaged in some phase
of production work. There are three
main categories.
1. MAINTENANCE SUPERVISION. Re-
sourcefulness and initiative are
needed in men selected for this work.
Among their many duties are the
scheduling of preventive mainte-
nance and emergency repairs to mini-
mize down time, suggesting equip-
ment improvements to reduce the
maintenance load, and estimating
costs of changes or major repairs.
Normally, the supervisor estab-
lishes maintenance procedures, di-
rects transfer of personnel from one
group or area to another, and assigns
duties. He sets up office and field
work methods and controls the sup-
plies of spare parts and stores.
The importance of this work is
emphasized in some Du Pont plants
where more men are needed to main-
tain the equipment than to operate
it. At one plant, the division main-
tenance superintendent, a man with
several years experience behind him,
is responsible for 1,500 pieces of
equipment and 100 miles of pipe. He
has 120 men under him, including
10 foremen.
2. PRODUCTION SUPERVISION.Other
mechanical engineers at Du Pont
use their knowledge of mechan-
ical equipment in solving production
problems. They must see that raw
materials are on hand, that maxi-
mum yields are obtained with mini-
mum loss, and that the products meet

rigid specifications. In addition, they
must train men in proper equipment
operation and maintain good person-
nel relations.
One area supervisor, also an ex-
perienced man, usually has charge of
from 125 to 150 people, including 6
to 10 foremen.
Keeping compressors in top running condi-
tion is a typical maintenance-group problem.
3. PLANT TECHNICAL. Other
M.E.'s at Du Pont are assigned to
the teams of plant technical men re-
sponsible for process and production
improvements. In this work, they
help solve problems on machine de-
sign, strength of materials, control in-
struments, packing materials for
high-pressure equipment, etc.
Actually—in maintenance, pro-
duction and development—the pos-
sibilities are almost unlimited at
Du Pont for the M.E. who likes the
manufacturing side of industry.

conditions which were difficult to recon-
cile with Lord Rayleigh's theory of in-
extensional deformation of shells. This
was the start of the modern theory of
shells and Love's approximate theory,
which he justly ought to share with
Aron, has come to be known as "Love's
first approximation." It would be diffi-
cult either to find or write a paper on the
theory of shells today without specific
reference to Love's first approximation or
his extended controversial work of
"Love's second approximation" which has
been the subject of numerous papers dur-
ing the past decade.
Between 1899 and 1901, fundamen-
tal contributions to elasticity were made
by Mitchell. Not only did he solve a
great number of problems of two-dimen-
sional elasticity which generally form
portion of the material of a first course
in the theory of elasticity in our present-
day schools, he defined precisely for the
first time the notion of plane strain and
plane stress and obtained an exact theory
for the flexure of plates (in special
cases) in the state of plane stress. Love
generalized further the results of Michell
for the flexure of plates to what is now
known as the "Love-Michell" theory,
which result, for the first time showed the
consequence of an account of the shear
deformation (commonly omitted in the
classical theory of plates) in the expres-
sion of bending moments, at least in a
special case.
In addition to his many publications in
the field of elasticity, geodynamics and
electrodynamics, his famous treatise on
elasticity, and his essay on geodynamics,
Love also published a textbook on theo-
retical mechanics in 1897. It is a book
which stands somewhat inbetween the
Lamb's and Whittaker's books on dy-
namics. The treatise on the "Mathemati-
cal Theory of Elasticity," stands in a class
with Lamb's "Hydrodynamics" and is a
classic. In this connection, E. A. Milne,
says: "If a comparison between good
things is legitimate, it may be said that

ly but the tougher reading as befitting a
more intractable subject."
During World War I, Love was en-
gaged in government research on ballis-
tics which resulted in "Love's Method,"
for the Calculation of Trajectories and
which, unfortunately was never published.
* * *
Love was essentially a mathematician
with an interest in 18th century mathe-
matics, such as partial differential equa-
tions and spherical hormonics. His
views towards applications were there,
as evidenced in parts of his treatise on
elasticity, but he was no engineer. Elas-
ticity like plasticity today experienced a
long period of controversy over its basic
principles which were well accepted and
understood by 1870 (this is not to be
mistaken with the special theories of elas-
ticity, such as theory of shells which is
still a subject of dispute). Undoubtedly
Love was attracted to the subject of elas-
ticity because, as a mathematician he
could up to a point have complete con-
fidence in the foundation upon which
he was building.
It appears that Love's lectures at Ox-
ford were ever models of form and that
he devoted much care to the preparation
of subjects of his lectures. Although Love
had lectured and was active in research
for many years on relativity and tensor
calculus, in his book on elasticity he has
scarcely recognized the fact that the com-
ponents of strain on the one hand and
the components of stress on the other
form symmetric tensors. His notation is,
in fact, unfortunate, as it conceals the ten-
sor nature of the components of stress
and his omission of the factor of y2 in his
definitions of the non-principal compon-
ents of strain could be disastrous in trans-
formation formulas.
No notice of him would be complete
without the mention of his hobby of
croquet which apparently he played very
often on the lawns of Oxford parks.
He: "How about joining me in a cozy
weekend in a quiet downtown hotel?"
She: "Knowledge garnered from the
illuminating pages of the Kinsey survey
and awareness of your pejorativeness in
the more esoteric aspects of sexual be-
havior preclude you from such erotic
confrontation.
He: "I don't get it."
She: "That's just what I said."

blindfolded I'll paint either a black or a
red mark on your forehead. When I
take off the blindfold you will raise your
hand if you see a red mark and lower it
when you have determined what the color
on your own forehead is." The king
blindfolded the men and put a red mark
on all their foreheads. Then he removed
the blindfolds and all three men imme-
diately raised their hands. Soon one man
lowered his hand and said, "I know be-
cause none of the others know." How
did he determine the color on his fore-
head?

EXPANSION OF THE ENGINEERING CURRICULUM
In recent years, there has been a feeling on this campus
(as well as on others) that the present under-graduate
engineering programs were inadequate to meet the needs of
many students. A need has been expressed by both studnts
and faculty for, 1.) more generalized study, including
subjects of a non-technical nature, 2.) a broader back-
ground in all the fields of engineering before specializa-
tion, and 3.) opportunity for further specialization in the
field of main interest.
It seems apparent that the only way to satisfy any or all
of these desires is to expand the present curriculum. There
are several possible methods of doing this:
1. The Engineering College could be made into an
advanced standing school, such as Dentistry and Law. The
engineer would be required to take a two or three year pre-
engine program in Lit. School to qualify for admission.
This program would include preparatory math and science
courses along with a well rounded program in the humani-
ties. Two or three years in Engineering College itself
would give the student plenty of time to specialize without
cutting short his general engineering background.
2. The engineering program could be lengthened within
the College. A five year program, such as is required for
architects, could include more general courses as well as
provide a greater opportunity for specialization.
3. Combined programs with other colleges could be
offered. At present, the Engineering College is accepting
students who have completed a three year course at one of
three qualified in-state colleges. These students classify as
juniors, and normally can graduate after two years at the
University. While this program does not allow any more
specialization than the usual four year program at the Uni-
versity, it does give the student a greater background of
generalized studies in both technical and non-technical
fields. Perhaps better examples of how combined pro-
grams can function are provided on this campus by the
civil and chemical engineering departments. Each of these
departments offers a five year program in cooperation with
the School of Literature, Science, and the Arts; leading to
two B.S. degrees; one in the engineering field, and one in
an allied scientific or artistic field. When enrolled in one
of these programs, the student spends his first two years in
L. S. and A. taking background courses in the humanities.
During his three years in Engineering School, there is
ample time for the student to specialize in a particular field
without losing the chance to gain a general knowledge of
the profession.
With the complexity of modern engineering increasing
at a rapid rate, it is probable that a lengthening of the en-
entire engineering program will eventually become a neces-
sity; but however desirable it might seem, it is unlikely
that such a drastic change could be made at this time. The
present shortage of engineers is too acute to delay the
graduation of those now in college, and discourage others
from entering the profession by adding another year or
two to their time in training. Many students who do not
feel the need for an increased exposure to learning and are
mainly interested in completing college and getting out
into the field would fight a compulsory increase in gradua-
tion requirements at this time.
What seems to be needed is a voluntary program which
would give those who are interested a chance to get the
background and specialization that they want, and not
interfere with the education of those who are satisfied with
the present program. Graduate school might be an answer
to the problem; but in graduate work the student must
specialize in a narrow advanced field, and can not get the
background in technical and non-technical subjects which
should be available in undergraduate work. A solution
which seems to fit the need more perfectly is the combined
program such as now available in the civil and chemical
engineering departments. These programs could be offered
in several fields in each department, and could be fit to the
needs of the individual student. A student enrolled in one
of these programs would get a broad background in the hu-
manities and sciences while under Lit. School jurisdiction,
make a general study of engineering topics, and still have
time for specialization in his field of interest. Because of
the closeness of engineering to other fields in the arts and
sciences, the additional work in L. S. and A. and the degree
granted should put the graduate of one of these combined
programs ahead of the engineer who is competent only in
one field of engineering.

There's been a cold war on in Minnesota lately
. . . And our metallurgists have won it.
Up in the iron ore range, where 40 below zero can
be expected frequently, shovel operators usually plan
their operations to remove a year's supply of ore
during warm weather months when the ore is work-
able. But recently, with steel requirements ever in-
creasing, shovel operators began working around-
the-calendar.
And they ran into trouble.
During one cold spell when the temperature
dropped to 40° below throughout the iron ore range,
the ore froze solid. The extreme cold caused steel in
the equipment to lose some of its toughness, and
power shovel booms and dipper sticks broke all over
the range as the huge steel dippers were rammed
into the frozen ore with tremendous force.
But there was one significant exception. Operators
using shovels with booms and dipper sticks made of
one particular steel went right on gouging up frozen
ore without any equipment trouble.
Those shovels stood up because the heavily
stressed parts were made from U-S-S Tri-Te.n—a
remarkably strong steel that has a high degree of
toughness, even at low temperatures.
Moreover, the users were able to cut the weight of
their Tri-Ten parts by 25%, even though some work-
ing stresses were increased 50%. "And," savs one
shovel manufacturer, "Tri-Ten steel has enabled our
customers to operate this equipment successfully at
temperatures as low as —45 F."
U-S-S TRI-TEN is only one of hundreds of steel
compositions developed by United States Steel to
meet special service conditions. Trained U. S. Steel
metallurgists work with manufacturers all over the
country to help solve problems involving the more
efficient use of steel. United States Steel Company,

• ALTON R. PATTERSON, who received his M.E.
from the University of Oklahoma in 1930, is
another engineer at Allison who has a respon-
sible position in an advanced field of science
and mechanics. He is responsible for the appli-
cation and best usage of hydraulic transmis-
sions, like the CD-850 shown in the inset, to
tanks and other heavy military vehicles.
These big and complex Allison Cross-Drive
transmissions do more than their name implies.
Along with the functions of a Torqmatic Trans-
mission, they also brake and steer the vehicle.
With a single lever, a tank driver is able to
maintain finger-tip control. To accomplish this
exacting assignment, some transmissions re-
quire as many as 5000 parts, including hy-
draulic drive, planetary gearing, steering and
braking mechanism and hydraulically-operated
clutches and bands.
Pat's job is to insure the proper mating of
transmission to vehicle, requiring him to work
closely with manufacturers and proving grounds
all over the country. One of the problems with
which he is now working is a track vibration
analysis and resolution of the effects of the
vibration on the transmission. The result of his
work will contribute toward better performance
of a military vehicle, longer life for its parts
and an improved product for our national de-
fense. And, meanwhile, Pat is accumulating skill
and experience in a field where the commercial
possibilities have hardly been scratched. He is
building his own future while working to in-
sure the peaceful future of his country.

John smith is a good mechanic who saves his
money and starts a little alley shop making
widgets. He works hard, hires two good fellow-
workers, his wife keeps the books, and he prospers.
He keeps costs low, sells widgets at $2 each, and
has a good year—he makes $1000 profit.
He's delighted. Now he'll buy modern machin-
ery that will cut costs so he can sell widgets for
$1.50. He knows he'll sell so many he can hire 3
more men and raise everybody's wage. Progress!
But no! The government steps in and takes
a big part of his $1000 for taxes. So John Smith
cannot buy the new machinery, 3 new jobs are
not created, wages cannot be raised.
In other words, the expansion which would
have increased widget supply and cut their cost
from $2 to $1.50 does not take place—exorbitant
taxes have throttled progress, kept supply
restricted, and have kept prices high; taxes have
held down the standard of living. In other words,
taxes have reduced jobs and wages, and injured
progress. Just as high taxes always do.

TECHNICAL REPORTING
BY
INTRODUCTION
This report has been prepared as a
model and guide for the writing of tech-
nical reports. Perhaps no other instrument
is of greater importance to engineers and
scientists than the technical report. In
order to make known the results of in-
vestigations, operations, and projects of a
technical nature, engineers and scientists
must be able to present effectively in the
form of reports the data and other ma-
terial they have gathered. These reports
should be so written that they can be
read and understood by persons who may
not have had technical training but who
may need to base decisions and actions on
the reports submitted to them by techni-
cal people.
This paper will consider the character-
istics of technical reports and the me-
chanics of preparing these reports. The
writer's approach to the problem of pre-
paring reports, the two basic types of
reports, the pattern of arrangement, the
component parts, and the language of the
report are considered in the order named.
THE PROPER APPROACH TO
TECHNICAL REPORTING
A report is a record either of things
done or of the status of things. In order
to properly prepare this record, the writer
of technical reports should remember two
basic rules:
1. Reports must be capable of verifi-
cation.
2. Reports exclude as far as possible,
judgments, inferences, and the use of
loaded words.
Reports which cannot be verified are of
little practical use. Intelligent and de-
pendable judgments cannot be made by
an executive on the basis of reports which
have no positive data or investigation re-
sults which have no positive data or in-
vestigation results which will back up the
material and conclusions presented in the
report. An executive must have facts and
analyses on which he can depend. He
jeopardizes his own position if he relies
upon unfounded or unsubstantiated re-
ports from his subordinates.
MERLE A. NELSON, '53E
Merle A. Nelson
The importance of this rule cannot be
over-stresed. A report which cannot be
verified if its accuracy is questioned
should not have been written in the first
place.
The report writer should not try to in-
fluence action. He is not the lawyer or
judge, so to speak, but rather the witness.
It is his job to report as accurately as pos-
sible the conditions, events, and results
of a particular happening or investigation.
The report writer must be objective. He
should state facts, results, and incontro-
vertible conclusions. This done, his job
is complete. It is then the province of the
executive to whom the report is submitted
to analyze the material of the report and
makes his decisions accordingly. In order
for the executive's judgment to be most
effective, therefore, the report must be
made as objective, accurate, and complete
as possible, and it should be verifiable in
case of dispute or further question.
TYPES OF REPORTS
In a statement of the uses to which re-
ports may be put, it is convenient to con-
sider reports as being of two general
types or classes, the long form and the
short form. These designations are made
only as a matter of convenience, for prac-
tices vary too widely to permit any posi-
tive boundaries to be drawn or rules to be
applied.
Long Form
As its name indicates, the long form
report is used for the recording of data
and results of investigations of a lengthy
nature, investigations which by their
scope or importance demand a thorough
and complete analysis, as opposed to an
abbreviated or summary analysis. Ex-
amples would be such topics as: the prop-
erties of alloy steels at elevated tempera-
tures; the effect of the depression in 1929
on the steel industry; an analysis of the
foundation requirements for a particular
structure; or, the use of glass as a coating
for steel. Such subjects as these are
lengthy by nature and demand, if pos-
sible, an all-inclusive analysis.
Short Form
Although no definite boundary can be
drawn between the long form and the
short form report, there are a number of
particular uses to which the short form
can be advantageously applied. A report
which is preliminary to a further study
or investigation can often be made quite
brief. Such a preliminary report may be
used to determine whether a more com-
plete study should be made of a particu-
lar project, or to determine the method of
approach to the succeeding work.
A short form report may consider only
a particular phase of a more comprehen-
sive investigation. An example would be
a report dealing with the cost of available
sites for a municipal water plant, where-
as the complete report would also con-
sider the source of water supply, the loca-
tion of the plant, and the design of the
plant.
The short form report may also present
a digest of a long report. Or it may
be used as a memorandum, for instance a
directive on the operation of a particular
machine.
Periodic or progress reports may also
be written in short form. Such reports are
generally not lengthy or comprehensive,
and hence the thorough analysis essential
to a long form report is not required.

USE OF OVERFIRE JETS
In the interest of smoke abatement,
overfire jets are now installed on thous-
ands of commercial and industrial coal-
fired furnaces. In some respects, jets play
a role similar to that of secondary pushers
on a stoker. Both are tools for promoting
better combustion. Secondary pushers are
periodically adjusted to improve combus-
tion conditions of the fuel bed, while
overfire jets are periodically employed to
improve combustion above the fuel bed.
Causes of Smoke
Smoke is finely divided carbon result-
ing from the breaking down of hydro-
carbons released from the coal during the
process of combustion. It occurs when
the volatile matter is heated to high tem-
peratures with insufficient oxygen and
turbulence to burn them. A number of
circumstances can create smoke formation.
For instance, all of you are quite familiar
with the dense black smoke resulting
from blanketing an incandescent bed of
partially burned coal or coke with green
coal. There is a quick release of hydro-
carbons which break down into smoke be-
cause the blanket has prevented adequate
air and turbulence reaching the volatile
as released. If the furnace door, how-
ever, is left partially open the density of
the smoke is substantially reduced, since
overfire air, drawn in by furnace draft, is
supplied to the volatiles as released. Al-
though this procedure helps, it will not
yield minimum smoke formation because
the air is not at sufficient pressure to
penetrate and create turbulence in all re-
gions of the furnace.
Excessive agitation of the fuel bed is
another well recognized cause of smoke.
When this occurs, there is created a sud-
den release of hydrocarbons beyond the
ability of the prevailing air and turbu-
lence to consume them.
Too cold, or too small a combustion
cavity are still other causes of smoke. In
the first case, the furnace temperature is
lower than the ignition temperature of all
or part of the hydrocarbons. With small
combustion space, there is insufficient fur-
nace-resident time of the hydrocarbons to
BY
WILLIAM S. MAJOR
insure complete combustion. This condi-
tion is frequently the principal cause of
smoke from older furnaces and locomo-
tive fireboxes.
Function and Type of Overfire Jets
The overfire jet is a device for pro-
viding turbulence and/or overfire air
above the fuel bed of hand-fired and
stoker-fired furnaces. There are two basic
types of jets: (1) plain steam jet (or
nonaspirating) and (2) the overfire air
jet. The plain steam jet is used where the
prime need is added turbulence to break
up stratification of the furnace gases and
provide better mixing of existing air with
the volatiles. The air-inducing jet is used
where there is a need for both turbulence
and additional overfire air. For meeting
these requirements the blower jet and
steam-air jet are available. With the first
type, air is fed to the furnace through a
series of tubes supplied through a header
by a moderate or high-pressure blower.
When steam is the motive power, steam
nozzles located ahead of the entrance to
the air tubes are used to aspirate the air
to the furnace.
Essential Features of Overfire Jets
As a result of research, sponsored by
Bituminous Coal Research, Inc., at Bat-
telle Memorial Institute, there is now a
clear understanding of the principles es-
sential for the design of effective and effi-
cient overfire jets. The research covered
extensive studies and tests on such factors
as: (1) air entrainment with different
tube diameters, lengths, and shapes; (2)
steam consumption of various shapes and
sizes of nozzles; (3) flow characteristics;
(4) spacing of jets; and (5) elevation of
jets above the fuel bed. Findings from
these studies, coupled with the valuable
experience of many smoke departments
and combustion engineers, were used in
establishment of the requisites for over-
fire jets.
Fig. 1 shows the essential features that
should be considered in the design of a
system of blower jets, and Fig. 2 covers
similar data for steam-air jets. Design
features for a plain steam or nonaspirat-
ing jet are shown on Fig. 3.

the design, construction, and application
of overfire jets. It explains clearly just
how to include the essential features
shown on Figs. 1, 2, and 3. This book
is now being revised to simplify still fur-
ther the design and construction proce-
dures.
Effect of Overfire Jets on
Furnace Performance
It is extremely difficult to formulate
definite conclusions as to just what bene-
fits, other than smoke abatement, might
accompany the use of overfire jets. Each
furnace reacts differently to jets, depend-
ing upon the furnace configuration, type
of firing equipment, jet location, coal
burned, and load conditions. Then, too,
expected changes in the furnace-gas com-
position and efficiency are usually small,
and errors in testing can easily alter the
interpretation of results. Furthermore,
considerable skill and know-how is re-
quired in conducting such tests. Most
plants do not have the necessary equip-
ment, time, or personnel for this charac-
ter testing. These facts account for the
limited factual data that have been pub-
lished on improved furnace performance
attributable to jets.
In July, 1938, Koessler ■ reported on
investigations of overfire air conducted on
a small traveling grate stoker. Air was
introduced through the front wall by
means of five jets, each with an area of
1.5 sq. in., directed downward at an
angle of 20 degrees from the horizontal.
Samples of gas were taken at 160 points
in the furnace, of which 45 were made
simultaneously. An approximate measure
of the completeness of combustion at
different locations was determined as fol-
lows: CO,
CO, + CO + MCraHm + CH4
Under conditions when the sample con-
tained only C02, the expression becomes
one. Results of this work are shown by
the lines on the furnaces shown in Fig. 4.
They were plotted from readings taken in
a vertical plane passing from front to
back through the center of the furnace.
Lines marked "1.0" disclose regions in
the furnace cavity where there was ap-
parently completeness of combustion.
View "A" shows furnace-gas conditions
when employing a pressure of about 9 in.
wg on the jets; and view "B," using a
pressure of 4.5 in. wg; while "C" shows
conditions without jets. A study of the
patterns in "A" and "B" shows that ap-
parent complete combustion is obtained
at a lower level in the furnace when
using a 9-in. pressure. Furthermore, from
"C" it appears that a substantial portion
of the gases left the furnace with un-
burned gases when overfire air and turbu-
lence above the fuel bed was not used.
Studies of a somewhat similar nature
were conducted by Grunert2 of the Com-
monwealth Edison Company of Chicago,
nearly 25 years ago. His studies were
conducted on forced-draft chain-gate stok-
ers to determine the benefits of overfire
air to reduce furnace gas stratification.

TECHNIC CELEBRATES 70TH ANNIVERSARY
I wish to extend my congratulations to
the staff of the Michigan Tecbnic as well
as to all those who have worked on this
magazine in the past 70 years. The Tecb-
nk has always kept pace with the progress
of engineering and of this Engineering
College. Those students who work and
have worked on this project are to be
commended for the fine job they have
done. I give them my best for the con-
tinued success of this worthwhile under-
taking.
George G. Brown
The Michigan Tecbnic, oldest of our
student publications, has accomplished a
modern miracle. Seventy years of age, it
still preserves its youth and vitality. I
send my hearty congratulations to this
vigorous veteran and most worthy repre-
sentative of the engineering students of
the University of Michigan.
Harlan Hatcher
With this issue, the Tecbnic completes
its seventieth year of publication. Putting
out a magazine for that length of time
represents a sizable donation of time by
many engineering students in each of
those seventy years; yet, we on this year's
Tecbnic staff feel that that time has been
well spent.
It is easy for students who are ingross-
ed in the technicalities of learning a com-
plex profession to lose sight of their goal
and become unaware of the progress made
in their fields outside of their own range
of vision. The Tecbnic's job is to sell
engineering to the engineer. We try to
present a selection of articles which will
not only tell the engineer what advances
have been made in his profession, but
show him the importance and significance
of these steps.
We feel that an engineering college
magazine has an important function on
any engineering campus. The Tecbnic is
the oldest such magazine on any campus
in the country, and we extend our hopes
that it will continue to fulfill this func-
tion for many more years to come.
The Staff

KINGSLEY P. JONESON, '55E
One of the aims of the Tecbnic is to as-
sist the engineering student in keeping
up to date with engineering advance-
ments. The sources of information about
these engineering advancements are wide-
ly scattered in many technical reports and
magazines. Without the aid of the
Tecbnic in collecting and publishing this
information under one cover, it would
be almost impossible for the average stu-
dent to keep up to date on the advance-
ments.
Quite often it may seem that these
engineering developments are little more
than the results of an experiment car-
ried out in some industrial laboratory.
However, they can play a very important
part in your life as an engineer or citizen.
This being our 70th anniversary issue,
we thought it would be appropriate to
take you back through the years of the
Tecbnic and show you what became of
some of the inventions and discoveries
previously presented in the Tecbnic.
First of all, let us take a look at an
article in the May, 1911 issue, written by
Professor Emeritus A. H. White. It was
entitled "Gas as an Illuminating Agent."
Here are a few parts of the article.
GAS AS AN ILLUMINATING AGENT
Alfred H. White
It is a commonplace of industrial his-
tory that eras of financial prosperity and
smooth sailing are eras of stagnation as
regards technical development. The in-
ventor with an idea to develop and the
engineer with an improvement to propose,
receive scant hearing so long as the sky is
clear, and it seems safe to rest on the
oars. It is only when storms of competi-
tion threaten, or more usually have actu-
ally broken, that all hands work together
to ward off threatened disaster.
The use of gas as an illuminating
agent affords no exception to the rule.
For fifty years it had no rival more for-
midable than the kerosene lamp and held
undisputed if flickering sway in the light-
ing of city streets, stores and the better
grades of residences. Then through the
genius of Edison, Brush and others came
the electric light and the new industry,
seeking every weapon which would aid it
in storming the citadel where gas was
intrenched, shouted abroad the advan-
tages of liberation from the tyranny of
the match, put the dull street lamp to
rout with the dazzling arc, and twined
for the home graceful chandeliers which
did not throw ugly shadows on the table
below. Hard pressed and facing certain
defeat, gas seized the staff, reached out in
the nick of time by Dr. Auer von Wels-
bach and with the new high power light
and the slogan "It is cheaper to use gas,"
started to win back its lost ground. Elec-
tricity found a new weapon, the tungsten
lamp. Gas countered with the inverted
Welsbach. The fight for the past five
years has been a merry one with the con-
sumer, the gainer by every improvement
put forth by either party. It is the pur-
pose of this article to set forth in a
popular way the present position of gas
as an illuminating agent.
The Welsbach mantle provided the gas
industry with a source of light which is
cheaper, and more nearly like daynight,
than any which its great competitor elec-
tricity can show. A standard upright
Welsbach mantle burning four feet of
gas per hour and with clear chimney will
easily give sixty candle power in the hori-
zontal direction or fifteen candles per
cubic foot during a life of over 500 hours.
Many mantles have been studied in our
laboratories which have given better re-
sults, burning with fair efficiency even
more than 1500 hours, but taking into
account the high loss by accidental break-
age the figure of 500 hours is safe. The
modern electric tungsten lamps give about
iy4 candles per watt, and the life of
the lamp is possibly longer although
breakage is high in this case also. On the
basis for a price of $1.00 per thousand
cubic feet for gas and 10^ per kilowatt
for electricity the cost of burning for
1000 hours a 60 candle Welsbach as com-
pared with a 60 watt (48 candle) tung-
sten lamp would be $4.00 for gas as
compared with $6.00 for electricity. When
the mantle broke, a new one could be
bought for twenty-five cents. The elec-
tric lamp would cost six times that sum.
Artificial light is not usually wanted,
however, to illuminate the upper part of
14

tables, show cases and counters. Here is
where the inverted Welsbach shines pre-
eminent as its greatest candle power, in-
stead of being thrown horizontally, is di-
rected vertically downward. There can be
no question but that, under almost all con-
ditions of competition where the installa-
tions were designed skillfully, gas will be
found to give a better illumination at a
decidedly lower price than electricity . . .

One of the objections sometimes made
against gas is that the gases from its
combustion vitiate the atmosphere. This
objection is largely fanciful. It is true
that a burner consuming four feet of
gas per hour will use up rather more
than four feet of oxygen and produce
about two feet of carbon dioxide per
hour. It is also true that the ventilation
of a room is considered bad when the
amount of carbon dioxide in the air
rises from the normal amount of .04%
to .10% because of respiration. But there
should be a sharp distinction drawn be-
tween the emphasis to be laid on carbon
dioxide from respiration which indicates
pollution from bacteria and poisonous
waste products from the lungs, and the
carbon dioxide from a gas burner. It is
hardly possible to conceive conditions
where the vitiation of the air from prop-
erly manipulated gas burners can be seri-
ous.
The great advantage of the electric
light is its convenience. No one has yet
devised a really dependable device for
turning on and off gas light by the pres-
sure of a button at a distance. The heat
from a gas light is also greater than
from an electric incandescent of equal
candle power. Advantages on the side
of gas however are greater cheapness,
better color of light, and freedom from
fluctuation. In latter years gas has been
more than holding its own with its great
competitor.
Can you imagine still using gas lamps
today because electric bulbs would be too
expensive? That was the situation in 1911.
Not only the articles, but also some
of the advertisements presented the ad-
vancement of the age. On the left is one

In 1950, 70 per cent of the American
homes had showers.1 Yet, as you can see
by this ad, at one time showers in the
home were rather unusual.

Another article showing engineering
advancement was the electric railways
article in the Technic of May, 1925.
There seemed to be some doubt at the
time of the writing as to whether electri-
cal railways would continue to thrive or
become a museum piece. Perhaps if you
read the sections of the article printed
below, you will better understand what
I mean.
ELECTRIC RAILWAYS DO WE
NEED THEM?
B. C. Cobb
The degree of financial success attain-
able by any business is regulated by two
factors. First, there must be a market for
the product. Second, the price received
for the product must be sufficient to pay
all the costs of supplying it, plus a rea-
sonable return to those who represent the
capital invested. The electric railway busi-
ness is no exception to these elementary
but fundamental economic laws. On them
rests the answer to the question regard-
ing the permanency of the electric rail-
way as a public servant—the question
singled out discussion today. . . .
From 1888 up to the year 1916 electric
railways grew and prospered. Their se-
curities were held in high favor among
investors because they believed that gen-
erally speaking the local street car com-
pany had the exclusive right to furnish
an indispensable service to the public at
a price fixed to yield a satisfactory profit.
They reasoned that the business was oper-
ated on a cash basis, that it required a
moderate working capital, and that the
riding habit would grow with the increase
in population of the communities served.
These factors seemingly combined to
make a very satisfactory earnings posi-
tion. This reasoning and these factors,
however, were somewhat disarranged and
interferred with by the advent and the
development for public transportation by
1916 was undergoing an important
change. This change at first was almost
imperceptible. It has been gradual but
far reaching ever since and it has caused
those responsible for the management of
traction properties many anxious mo-
ments, and likewise it has aroused mis-
givings in the hearts of many people own-
ing traction securities as to the safety of
their investment.
Growth of the Private Automobile
In 1913 only 1,200,000 passenger
automobiles were registered, or one
automobile to approximately every ninety
persons in the country. By 1923
this registration had grown to over
14,000,000, or one automobile to every
eight persons. Under ordinary conditions
the electric railway industry would have
taken more serious cognizance of this
new form of competition and would have
prepared to meet it, but the war and its
disastrous consequences upset everything
and made impossible many things that
perhaps would have been done. You are
familiar with what took place in the way
of increased cost in all lines of business^
and with what happened to the electric
railways with the price of their product
fixed on a pre-war basis and their ability
to increase such price surrounded by many
difficulties. It is sufficient to say that they

New Projection Positive Paper Available
A new photographic paper for the pro-
duction of positive paper prints either
through reduction or enlargement has
been announced by the Eastman Kodak
Company.
The new paper, known as Kodagraph
Projection Positive Paper, can be used in
a process camera to make direct reduc-
tion positives from large drawings, or it
can be used with an enlarger to produce
positive prints from positive microfilm
records. The former application is in
line with the trend to produce smaller
prints of engineering drawings. These
prints, experience has shown, are just as
legible and easier to handle than the
typical large bulky drawing. They also
require less material.
The ability of this new paper to repro-
duce positive microfilm prints as positive
enlargements is expected to be particu-
larly helpful to libraries and other places
which have considerable quantities of
positive microfilm duplicates.
Kodagraph Projection Positive Paper
requires a special developer. It will, how-
ever, be available through all Kodak In-
dustrial dealers.
Glycerine-Selenium Dioxide Catalyst
Speeds Resin Curing Time: Produces
Tension-Free Castings
Up to now, the surest method of ob-
taining tension-free castings of phenol-
formaldehyde resins has been to allow
them to harden slowly and carefully at
relatively low temperatures. Various
methods involving acid catalysts, higher
working temperatures and pressures, etc.,
have been used to speed up the hardening
time, but in most cases, some sacrifice in
quality has been required because of the
internal tensions the finished products
contain.
A patent was granted recently to a
method which is claimed to solve both
sides of this problem by considerably
shortening the hardening time of cast
resins and at the same time producing
castings that are entirely free from ten-
sions. A mixture of equal parts glycerine
and selenium dioxide is the catalyst
recommended in the method. The cat-
alyst is added to the vacuum-dehydrated
Edited by PAUL ANDERSON
resin in a ratio of one to four just prior
to casting, and the resin cured at 80°C.
Besides providing tension-free castings in
much less curing time, the method is said
to offer the further advantage that the
resin syrup can be stored for relatively
long periods before the catalyst is added
and the resin cast. Castings made accord-
ing to this method are also claimed to
have high flexural and impact strengths.
information immediately at far less cost.
All new Navy airplanes must be tested
for rate of descent before they are placed
in regular operation. Formerly in carrier
landings, with an experimental plane, a
pilot would not know for some time if
he had come in for a landing at the cor-
rect rate of descent. With TRODI's
rapid "brain", the data is ready for the
pilot as soon as he steps from the cockpit.

North American's New "Brain," TRODI
An electrical-optical "brain" developed
by North American Aviation to give in-
stant data on how fast an airplane "hits

in operational tests aboard the Navy's
aircraft carrier Midway, the company an-
nounced today.
The instrument, Touchdown Rate of
Descent Indicator, nicknamed TRODI, is
being produced by North American's
Electro-Mechanical Engineering and Man-
ufacturing Departments. In the past the
rate of descent for an experimental air-
plane has been recorded by cameras, but
the photographed data was not avail-
able for several days. TRODI flashes this

necessary.
A vital part of recent carrier suitability
tests aboard the Midway for the North
American FJ-2 Fury Jet and three other
new Navy fighters, the new instrument re-
corded in a few landings results that
would have required a number of days
with the old camera method.
TRODI measures rate of descent with
an accuracy of 0.4 feet per second and is
in regular service with the U. S. Navy.
The instrument also has applications to
benefit other branches of the military
services and civil aviation.

landing characteristics of airplanes con-
trolled by automatic or manual systems,
helps instructors teach student pilots in
skillful and safe landings, and aids in
determining landing conditions suitable
for various aircraft.
To seek rate of descent data, TRODI
sends out two parallel beams of light,
thin vertically and wide horizontally.
They are one foot apart. A mirror sys-
tem on the incoming airplane cuts the top
beam, reflecting the light back to a
photoelectric cell, which starts an electri-
cal charge into a condenser. The de-
scending airplane then cuts the second
and lower beam reflects it, and stops the
charge going into the condenser.
The electrical charge stored during
the interval between beams is quickly
translated by TRODI from voltage to
rate of descent in feet per second.
Electroluminescence Explored
for Westinghouse
Electroluminescence, the illumination
exhibited by a phosphor-coated flat glass
panel when subjected to an electromag-
netic field, is being explored for the West-
inghouse Lamp Division by the two top
scientists in the field. Professor Georges
Destriau and Dr. Joseph Mattler, both
from the Sorbonne, University of Paris,
France, have been working in the Lamp
Division research laboratory for the past
nine months on advanced electrolumin-
escence experiments.
The two scientists began exploring the
phenomenon in 1935, more than ten years
before American lighting engineers sus-
pected its possible commercial uses. They
published joint papers on the basic ideas
in 1936. In this country, they have been
testing a new superior phosphor. Bringing
them here has given Westinghouse scient-
ists the opportunity to get first hand in-
formation on the progress of electro-
luminescence. Professor Destriau has re-
turned to France to continue experiments
as a Westinghouse consultant.
E. G. F. Arnott, director of the Lamp
Division research laboratories, has stated
that the experiments have been most
valuable in learning more about the light-
ing qualities of phosphors. As a commer-
cial lighting source, electroluminescence
is still just a possibility. Under ordinary
conditions, it produces only a small
amount of light at very low efficiencies.
Jets in Late 1950's
A reasonable assumption would be that
even before I960—by late 1957 or early
1958—United States scheduled air car-
riers will have some jet aircraft in service.
While these jets transports probably will
not exert a strong influence on the domes-
tic rail-air travel market, their impact on
overseas travel should reach substantial
levels bv ehe beginning of the 1960's.
Jet transports, at this stage in their de-
velopment, however, are not yet consider-
ed economical for commercial airline
operations. Consequently, the airline
equipment which is anticipated to carry
the increasing air traffic throughout this
decade will be almost wholly of the
periodic removal of inspection plates led
to accelerated thread wear. More recently,
aluminum parts were specified on 40
models of the company's six-cylinder en-
gines. The low-loading characteristics of
threads tapped directly in this metal posed
problems in both manufacture and main-
tenance: aluminum threads often were
damaged in normal assembly, and became
prematurely worn by regular removal of
parts for inspection or adjustment.
By standardizing on the stainless steel
inserts supplied by Heli-Coil Corporation
of Danbury, Conn., the manufacturer has

proved and economical conventional
types.
Helical Thread Inserts
Boost Engine Production
Stainless steel wire thread inserts have
solved two problems for the Fageol Prod-
ucts Company engineers at their Kent,
Ohio, plant. First, through the use of the
inserts, as liners for tapped holes in the
vulnerable aluminum castings, production
of Fageol's automotive and industrial en-
gines has been increased by six per cent;
second, by using the inserts in relatively
inaccessible tapped holes, service difficul-
ties in the field have been sharply reduced.
Formerly, in these high-speed engines
which range from 150 to 225 hp in out-
put, such inserts were used only where
eliminated thread damage in assembly
operations and thus has cut production
salvage costs. Also, of course, he has com-
pletely shielded aluminum threads from
wear in service.
At the same time, use of these inserts
has overcome a serious service problem
which might have resulted from the use
of unprotected aluminum threads in places
difficult of access. Such locations, on these
engines, included the timing chain cover,
which uses five 5/16-18 cap screws, and
the distributor gear box, which takes two
%-l6 inserts. In both assemblies, relative
inaccessibility when installed in chassis
would have made a plug-and-retap repair
operation needlessly difficult.
Fageol now recommends the use of

were harder hit and suffered more finan-
cially than any other large industry.
Public's Riding Habit Changes
Probably the most important change re-
maining, after many fare adjustments had
been made to meet the prevailing cost of
operation, was the change in the riding
transportation a very minor consideration
to many people. In fact pleasure vied
with utility in transportation service. The
public wanted variety in its form of
transportation, the same as it wanted
variety in its forms of pleasure. For ex-
ample, the person who had acquired the
desire for good music and had the money
would enjoy but could not afford either
type of entertainment mentioned was
comparable to those who bought a low
price car.
Thus the market for organized public
transportation was affected to a consid-
erable extent by the increasing number
of people who daily transported them-
selves in their own cars. This evolution in
transportation left the street car company
in the position of handling the large
mass of so-called "necessity riders"—
those who did not own automobiles, and
in a great measure it took away the
cream—the overloads and the fill-ins.
United Service Needed
Along with the development of the
family passenger automobile also came
the development of the motor bus oper-
ated as a public utility for group trans-
portation. The automobile appeal has
been so strong and become so popular
that the thought in the minds of many
people has been that this new type of
transportation service would sooner or
later entirely supplant the service ren-
dered by the electric railway. It has grad-
ually become apparent, however, that
neither the street car nor the motor bus
by itself can give the public in most
of our cities the combination of pleasure
and utility it desires in all year round
transportation facilities. Each form of
transport has certain operating limitations
and advantages over the other. Conditions

CHANGE IN THE GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS
DEAN GEORGE GRANGER BROWN
College of Engineering
University of Michigan
The faculty of the College of Engineer-
ing has changed the method of stating
the requirement for graduation from the
Engineering College. At the present time
the scholastic requirements for gradua-
tion are stated as follows:
"1. He must complete the required
courses of his elected program.
"2. He must complete a sufficient num-
ber of electives approved by his program
adviser to make a total of 140 credit
hours with an average grade of 2.0 or
more."
This is a common method for stating
graduation requirements throughout the
country.
However, there are great differences
in the preparation and abilities of enter-
ing freshmen. In a large engineering
school it is possible and very desirable to
start the entering freshman at the proper
level and pa.ce according to his individual
preparation and ability. This practice has
been followed for many years and is evi-
dent particularly in freshmen mathematics
and chemistry. The entering freshman
may start at any one of four levels in each
of these two subjects, depending upon
his preparation and his ability in the sub-
ject as determined by an orientation
period placement examination.
If the student is qualified to take a fast
program in mathematics, for example,
the sequence 17, 18 and 54, totaling 12
hours instead of the sequence course 13,
14, 53 and 54 totaling 16 hours, under
the present requirement he has to take
the additional four hours to make the
total of 140 hours. Furthermore, since
trigonometry is not required for admis-
sion, a freshman may take Math 8 and
receive two hours additional credit for
this course if he has not taken trigo-
nometry in high school.
The effect of these rules is to discour-
age the election of trigonometry and col-
lege algebra in high school and it fails
to recognize that a student has attained
the same level of performance in mathe-
matics by completing Math 54 by taking
either sequence of courses mentioned
above.
The same situation exists in the case of
the chemistry courses.
The new method recomended for stat-
ing the graduating requirements reads as
follows:
"The scholastic requirements for grad-
uation are expressed in terms of the qual-
ity and level of attainment reached by
the student and not in terms of the total
number of credit hours acquired in col-
lege. The basic level of attainment re-
quired of all students in every program
is demonstrated ability in English, draw-
ing, mathematics, chemistry, physics and
materials equivalent to the satisfactory
completion of the following courses;
English 11, 12 and 21; Drawing 1 and 2;
Mathematics 54, Chemistry 5E, Physics
46, Chemical and Metallurgical Engi-
neering or Metal Processing 1. In addi-
tion, the student must complete the spe-
cific program of courses or their equiva-
lent required in his elected degree pro-
gram with an average of C (2.0) or more
in all courses taken while enrolled in the
college."
By carefully planning his high school
program, a superior student may material-
ly decrease the time required to graduate
from the engineering college. Depending
upon his preparation and ability, as indi-
cated by high school standing and orien-
tation period examinations, he may save
six hours in the mathematics sequence
and three hours in chemistry. This makes
it possible to graduate by taking 131
credit hours of courses in the Engineering
College instead of the 140 credit hours
required of the average entering fresh-
man. This, alone, represents the saving of
the equivalent of a summer session or a
semester of half-time work. In addition,
students who have attained a sufficiently
high regree of proficiency in English
composition and speech, drawing and
other subjects in which attainment levels
are stated in the several degree programs
may be able to save additional time in
the completion of their degree require-
ments.
It is hoped that this procedure may en-
courage high school students who wish to
enter the Engineering College to come
better prepared in mathematics, English
and chemistry or physics and drawing, as
the freshman can capitalize on his better
preparation in these fields under the new
plan, where no such advantage exists
under the present rules.
The new plan also makes it easier to
transfer the credits from junior colleges
to the record of the student at the Uni-
versity. When the graduation require-
ments are stated in terms of the total
number of hours credit, there is always
the possibility of misunderstanding re-
garding the number of credit hours that
can be transferred and accepted toward
graduation. Under the new plan it is ex-
pected that all such credit hours can be
transferred as a single total and the
transfer student simply told what courses
he is required to take to complete the re-
quirements independent of the number
of credit hours that may appear on his
record.
There is a marked tendency on the part
of Engineering Colleges to require four
years of mathematics in high school for
entrance. At Michigan we feel we have
accomplished all the desirable features of
this entrance requirement and, at the

JNobody can buy a length of cast iron pipe
unless it has passed the Hydrostatic Test at the foundry.
Every full length of cast iron pipe is subjected to this
test under water pressures considerably higher than
rated working pressures. It must pass the test or go
to the scrap pile.
The Hydrostatic Test is the final one of a series of
routine tests made by pipe manufacturers to assure
that the quality of the pipe meets or exceeds the re-
quirements of standard specifications for cast iron
pressure pipe.
Few engineers realize the extent of the inspections,
analyses and tests involved in the quality-control of
cast iron pipe. Production controls start almost liter-
ally from the ground up with the inspection, analysis
and checking of raw materials—continue with con-
stant control of cupola operation and analysis of the
melt—and end with inspections and a series of accept-
ance and routine tests of the finished product.
Members of the Cast Iron Pipe Research Associa-
tion have established and attained scientific standards
resulting in a superior product. These standards, as

The form in which reports are organ-
ized varies widely in practice. Many com-
panies have developed a standardized
form to be used within their particular
organization, and the only rule which can
be drawn here is that the writer must
conform to the standardsT&gt;f his particular
firm or organization. Nevertheless, the
following general patterns of arrang-
ment can be presented as conventional
forms.
Long Form Short Form
Title page Title page
Letter of transmittal Abstract
Table of contents Table of contents
Introduction Introduction
Summary Body
Body Conclusions
Conclusions (Appendix)
Appendix (Bibliography)
Bibliography
The short form report ordinarily will
not have an appendix or bibliography.
The main difference between these two
patterns is in the placing of the sum-
mary. In modern practice, the summary
of a long form report follows the intro-
duction. This practice makes it possible
for a busy executive to read the introduc-
tion and summary and thus quickly grasp
the substance of the report without read-
ing through the entire paper. This prac-
tice is especially helpful in long and de-
tailed reports.
A separate summary is ordinarily not
used in the short form report. Instead,
the summary is included in the abstract,
which may be written in text form or in
letter form, and which, as in the long
form, is placed at the beginning of the
report.
COMPONENT PARTS
Title Page
The title page of a report should du-
plicate the cover. It usually presents the
title of the report, the name of the author,
and the name of the firm or organization
for which the report is written.
Letter of Transmittal
The letter of transmittal is a conven-
tional device used to transfer the report
from the writer to the person to whom the
report is submitted. It is not an introduc-
tion or summary, but merely a prefatory
statement which refers to the assignment,
the date of assignment, and the date of
REPORT WRITING
(Continued from page 11)
completion. It may also point out sections
of the report in which the reader may be
particularly interested. The letter of trans-
mittal is generally used only for long
form reports.
Abstract
The abstract is used as a preface to the
short form report. It states the subject of
the report, and the purpose or object of
the report. It also includes a brief sum-
mary, the recommendations of the writer,
and a list of the main headings in the
order of appearance in the report.
The abstract may be written in ordinary
text form or letter form. If it is written
as a letter, it will include the assignment
and the date of assignment in addition to
the items mentioned above. It generally
will also include a statement that the
report accompanies the letter.
Table of Contents
The table of contents should list all
the headings, both main and subheadings,
which appear in the report. These head-
ings should be duplicated exactly as they
appear in the report, and in the same
order. In no case should any of the sub-
headings be omitted from the table of
contents.
Although chapters and sections of
books are identified by numbers and list-
ed by these numbers in the table of con-
tents, this practice is not followed in re-
port writing. Only in the case of very
long reports may sections be numbered.
In almost all cases, the headings should
be listed without numbers.
The main headings should be listed at
the extreme left side of the table, and all
subordinate headings properly indented.
For clarity, lead lines should be run from
the headings to the page numbers.
Introduction
Every report should have an introduc-
tion which states what is going to be
done, why it is being done, and how the
author intends to proceed. The purpose
or aim of the report should be stated at
the beginning of the introduction, or in
the part dealing with the reasons why the
report is being written. The introduction
often is concluded with an enumeration
of the divisions of the report.
Summary
The purpose of the summary is to give
briefly the substance of the report. It
should not be merely a repetition of the
introduction, and it should not include a
large quantity of data, or any charts or
graphs. The writer should keep in mind
that the summary may be the only section
that the executive will read, and that,
therefore, the summary should be design-
ed to give the best possible picture of the
material in the report, in as concise form
as possible.
Body
Division of Material: The material in
the body of a report should be divided
into its essential component parts, and a
heading should be found for each of
these parts. The following rules should
be applied in analyzing the material for
the purpose of making divisions:
1. Divisions should be exclusive of
each other, that is, they should not over-
lap.
2. Divisions should be made on a
single important basis.
3. Divisions should be single, not mul-
tiple. Headings such as "Materials Han-
dled and Flow Pattern" should be
avoided.
4. Divisions should be of equal rank.
5. Divisions should be coordinate, that
is, there should be a logical basis of cor-
relation of the divisions.
6. Divisions should be set up in paral-
lel grammatical form.
The application of these rules to the
division of the material of a report will
result in a logical outline from which the
writer can work to organize his material
effectively.
Mechanics of Presentation: A report
which is attractively presented will be
easier to read than one in which the ma-
terial is crowded and poorly organized.
One of the best means of preventing a
sloppy appearance is to leave plenty of
space and thereby block out the parts of
the report. Double-spacing of typewritten
reports is helpful, and plenty of open
space should be left before and after
headings. Also, the margins should be
fairly wide and uniform.
The divisions of the report should be
emphasized by centering the main head-
ings horizontally. The second order head-
ings should be at the left margin, and the
third order headings indented and set into

WHERE YOU WORK
After your period of training—at full
pay—you may (1) remain with the
Laboratories in Southern California in
an instructive or administrative capac-
ity, (2) become the Hughes represen-
tative at a company where our equip-
ment is being installed, or (3) be the
Hughes representative at a military base
in this country—or overseas (single men
only). Compensation is made for
traveling and moving household effects,
and married men keep their families
with them at all times.
YOUR FUTURE
In one of these positions you will gain
all-around experience that will increase
your value to our organization as it
further expands in the field of electron-
ics. The next few years are certain to

booster fan that received its air from the
plenum chamber. By means of water-
cooled sampling tubes, the gases were
simultaneously sampled at a number of
points above the fuel bed at the entrance
to the first pass of the boiler. Fig. 5
shows a plot of composite of a large
number of readings at the first pass, both
with and without overfire jets. It is in-
teresting to note the uniform composition
of the gases, low excess air, and lack of
unburned gases across the entire width
of the first pass when overfire air was
used. Other favorable results from over-
fire air included: (1) shortening of the
flame and reduction of the final tempera-
tures when surfaces are of the same de-
gree of cleanliness, and (2) reduction of
slag and soot deposits in the first pass of
the boiler. This latter benefit from over-
fire air turbulence was also reported in
Fuel and the Future.3 In this report, it is
stated that one means of preventing harm-
ful deposits appears to be: "Creation of
maximum turbulence in the furnace so
that the deleterious material may be ab-
sorbed on particles of fly-ash or carbon
in the gas stream."
Furnaces of spreader stokers are par-
ticularly responsive to overfire jets. Tur-
bulence imparted by jets breaks up the
tendency for gas stratification which is
characteristic of this type of firing. Even
though there is a wide difference of

opinion as to the number, type, and loca-
tion of the jets, few, if any, spreader
stokers are now installed without some
form of overfire jet. The value of jet
turbulence is well recognized as a neces-
sity for most advantageous furnace com-
bustion and low smoke density.
Table I shows smoke densities with
and without the turbulent influence of
overfire jets on a spreader stoker furnace,
as determined from continuous smoke-
recording meter charts. These results
should not be interpreted as representative
for all furnaces, but rather as an indica-
tion of just how effective jet turbulence
may prove in smoke control under some
conditions.

Meissner and Funk * have reported that
steam or air jets have reduced cinder
carry-over and smoke and increased boiler
efficiency by as much as 1 to 3 per cent.
Gilg 5 has reported test data on a large
underfeed stoker-fired boiler where the
use of overfire air raised the "no-smoke"
limit of the furnace equivalent to approx-

imately 25 per cent increased boiler ca-
pacity and also raised efficiency 3 per
cent through reduction in cinder loss from
7.2 to 4.2 per cent. Other test work on
the same type of stoker, conducted by
Carroll,6 disclosed approximately 3-5 per
cent reduction in total heat loss (due to
unburned gases) by the use of overfire
air, as may be seen in Table 2.

Tests conducted by Engdahl and
Strang 7 on a 100-hp single-retort under-
feed stoker-fired boiler showed better
heat transfer to the boiler when the fur-
nace had the benefit of overfire jet turbu-
lence. On 24-hour ASME Code tests,
the boiler exit-gas temperature was 586° F
with 11.7 per cent carbon dioxide using
jets, as compared to 624°F with 12.1 per
cent carbon dioxide at the same boiler
output without jets in operation. Since
these results do not follow the normal
pattern of higher temperature with lower
carbon dioxide, other factors unchanged,
it was concluded that cleaner gases enter-
ed the boiler when the furnace had jet
turbulence. As a result, there was less
soot to insulate the tubes and a higher
heat transfer to the boiler.
Location of Jets
Few definite rules can be established
for locating jets. Maximum turbulence
occurs when the jet stream opposes the
general direction of gas flow or is direct-
ed to slice across the flow. As to distance
above the fuel bed, too high an elevation
will not be effective because it will strike
the gases after smoke has formed. The
jet stream however, should not impinge
on the fuel bed or scrub adjacent furnace
walls. Fuel-bed matting or clinkering is
likely to result from the former, and

serious refractory erosion from the latter.
Of equal importance is to avoid jet im-
pingement on boiler surfaces since warp-
ing, cracking, or distortion of these sec-
tions may result.
Since the width of jet penetration is
only about one-tenth the depth of pene-
tration, this understanding provides a safe
rule to follow for location of jets in order
to avoid impingement. For example, if a
jet is designed for a depth of penetration
of ten feet, it should be located not less
than twelve inches from the adjacent wall
or boiler surface and not less than twelve
inches above the top of the fuel bed. This
knowledge of the jet pattern is also em-
ployed as a basis for determining the
number of jets required in furnace walls
to provide turbulence and/or overfire air
above the entire fuel bed.
As to travelling grate stokers, two
schools of thought exist on jet location.
One advocates jets in the rear walls in
order to force the lean gases rising from
the rear of the fuel bed toward the front
walls where the hydrocarbons are released.
The other school favors location of jets
in the front wall so that the maximum
turbulence is available where the hydro-
carbons are released.
Underfeed stokers usually perform at
low smoke density, except when the fuel
bed is manually disrupted. To aid smoke
abatement under these conditions upward
of 30 to 35 per cent overfire air may be
required.
When applying jets above underfeed
stokers, the jet streams are directed over
the retort. In the case of multiple retort
stokers, the jets are set to coincide with
retort spacing. Frequently a length of
penetration sufficient to cover the "hump"
of the fuel bed is adequate for smoke
abatement.
Steam Jets versus Blower Jets
Although steam is not an efficient
means of introducing overfire air to a
furnace as compared to blower jets, there
are frequently cases where the steam-air
jet should be used: for instance, on an
older furnace with limited life, where the
lower initial investment for steam jets
outweighs its higher operating cost. For
such cases, the jets can be constructed
at a nominal cost from standard pipe and
fittings available in the average plant
maintenance shop. When the furnace
need is primarily added turbulence, and
additional air would be detrimental to
furnace performance, the plain stream
jets is the only choice.
For newer furnaces, however, where
both overfire air and turbulence are need-
ed, the blower jet will generally show
sufficient savings in operating costs to
justify the added investment cost.
Summary
The overfire jet is a tool to accompany
good firing practices in the interest of
smoke abatement. Its basic function is to
provide turbulence and/or overfire air
where the hydrocarbons are released close
to the fuel bed and thus to prevent smoke
formation. Benefits, other than smoke
abatement, that have accompanied the use
of overfire jets include: (1) reduction of
slag and soot formation on boiler tubes,
(2) shortening of the flame and reduc-
tion of the final temperatures when sur-
faces are of the same degree of cleanli-
ness, (3) ability to operate with slightly
lower excess air without unburned com-
bustible gases, (4) increased boiler and
furnace efficiency, (5) reduction of both
quantity and carbon content of the cinder
carryover, and (6) substantial increase in
the "no-smoke" limit of the furnace.

Although the publishing of a college
magazine is not a large scale process in
comparison with national magazines; it is
an intricate process, requiring skill and a
great deal of cooperation between the
relatively inexperienced members of the
staff. A case in point is the publication
of The Michigan Tecbnic. The Technic
is the monthly magazine composed and
published by the students of The College
of Engineering. It is staffed entirely by
engineers, and its purpose is to encourage
engineers to write more fluently by hav-
ing them write articles about their work
and their interests. The staff itself, how-
ever, does very little of the actual writing.
Articles are solicited from the engineering
students and faculty, and the staff or-
ganizes and coordinates the material.
To facilitate smooth operation, The
Technic is divided into departments.
These departments are directed by a four-
man editorial board, consisting of the
Editor-in-Chief, the Associate Editor, the
Managing Editor, and the Business Man-
ager. The Editor-in-Chief's duty is to act
as a liaison man between the different de-
partments and to coordinate their actions.
The Associate Editor is in charge of so-
liciting copy for the magazine, both ar-
ticles and features, and editing that copy.
The time schedule is made up and en-
forced by the Managing Editor, who also
directs the preparation of the magazine
dummy. All bills and receipts are
handled by the Business Manager.
Each of the departments has its own
specialized tasks in the publication of The
Technic, and each has its own manager.
The articles department assists the Asso-
ciate Editor in obtaining articles, and re-
writing and proof-reading if necessary;
the features department gathers current
news notes, alumni news, interviews, and
jokes; and the illustrations department
has charge of all pictures and diagrams,

taking pictures when necessary and hav-
ing cuts made. Aside from these depart-
ments whose work is apparent to the
reader, there are several departments
whose very important jobs are not as
evident. Foremost among these is the ad-
vertising department. To a college maga-
zine, whose circulation rate is doubtful,
the only dependable profit is gained
through advertising. The publications staff
is rarely mentioned; but the men on this
staff perform one of the most difficult
tasks—that of combining articles, fea-
tures, illustrations, and advertising into a
magazine. Posters and notices which an-
nounce a forthcoming issue are made and
posted by the publicity department.
The final duties of each issue fall to the
circulation men, who mail out subscrip-
tion copies and arrange a schedule assign-
ing each member of the entire staff to
sell magazines during one of his free
hours.
For students to publish a monthly
magazine in their spare time, cooperation
and delicate timing are essential. The
work of all of the departments fits to-
gether like the pieces of a Chinese puzzle.
If the work of one department is not done
on time, the whole schedule is disrupted.
The schedule made up and posted by the
Managing Editor must be followed
strictly if The Technic is to come out on
time.
The best way to illustrate the necessary
timing and how each department fits into
the schedule is to give a typical schedule,
explaining the procedure involved.
The first item on the schedule for the
March issue of The Technic reads: "Copy
deadline, October 11." Long before this
deadline, the Associate Editor and the
articles department are busily engaged in
securing copy. Men from the articles de-
partment go to the head of each of the
Engineering College divisions to inquire
about possible material. Often these divi-
sion heads know of articles already writ-
ten, or can suggest engineers capable of
writing for The Technic. Although the
posted deadline is October 11, the ar-
ticles must be in the hands of the staff
several days before that date to allow
time for proofreading and typing. The
feature copy, due with the articles copy,

In 1873—train of the Clay Street Wire Rope Railway Company of San Francisco—
the first cable road ever built. On this street as in many other cases in San Francisco,
the cable cars were successfully used on grades as steep as one foot in six. This
system, first adopted where the grades were too steep for horses, replaced the
horsecar because of a saving of nearly fifty per cent. This system consisted of
an endless wire rope traveling at the rate of six to ten m.p.h. over idle sheaves in a
tube below the ground surface. Power was transmitted to the car by means of a
grip fastened to the car and passing through a narrow slot in the top of the tube.
Cars going downhill remained gripped to the rope thus returning work to the

ent has an advantage, but this advantage
cannot be considered permanent as the
time surely will come when the motor
bus will be obliged to pay a proper pro-
portion of the cost of maintaining the
roadbed provided by the public. Further-
more, the motor bus eventually will come
under regulations as to schedules and
routes similar to those that now apply
to the electric railway. In other words,
the bus cannot always expect to select
the routes and time it desires to operate,
but as a public utility it must be organ-

The mere combination of the electric

not going to entirely solve the problem of
city transportation. Both electric railways
and motor busses are confronted with an
exceedingly serious problem, and until it
is solved or relief is granted from present
conditions the matter of rendering quick,
efficient and dependable transportation in

Electrical energy is restless . . . would
jump at any chance to escape—if it could.
The fact that voltage can be stepped
up for transmission, stepped down for
use; that current can be led to and from
transformers, around switchboards, and
steered into circuits safely you may credit
to electrical apparatus builders. Impor-
tant materials to them are Synthane lam-
inated plastics.
Synthane laminated plastics are used
in transformers for spacers and coil forms
because it is an insulator unaffected by
oils; in tap changer panels because it is a
machinable insulator with high dielec-
tric strength; in "Glowtectors" because
of high insulation resistance and abuse-
resistance; in circuit breakers and bus
bars for its arc resistance.

.. with a pioneering twist
There's a real incentive in working out ways to
do things that have never been done before. And
problems in pioneering are constantly cropping
up at Western Electric—manufacturing unit of
the Bell Telephone System.
For example: the revolutionary electroforming
process dreamed up and made a reality by West-
ern Electric engineers for making copper coated
steel wire.
The big idea was this: Could a process be devel-
oped in which successive coats of copper, lead
and brass would be deposited on steel wire
electrolytically in one continuous operation?
Engineers of varied skills—electrical, mechani-
cal, chemical, metallurgical, civil—went to work
as a team. After solving many problems, they
came up with a process that makes better,
stronger wire at lower cost—does it at the rate
of 1 % bill ion feet per year.
Recent developments such as microwave radio
relay networks for telephone calls and television
programs—operator and customer dialing of
long distance calls—secret electronic equipment
for the Armed Forces—promise an ever-widen-
ing field for young engineers of varied training at
Western Electric.

inum threads have been previously unpro-
tected, and installs them in engines re-
turned to the factory for rebuilding or
service when necessary.
When?
The Atomic Energy Commission's
Fourth Semi-Annual report, issued in
1948, stated that it seemed impossible,
even "under the most favorable circum-
stances, to have any considerable portion
of the present power supply of the world
replaced by nuclear fuel before the ex-
piration of 20 years."
Nothing has developed since then
which would shorten this estimate ma-
terially; in fact, the statement still seems
quite optimistic. The development of
atomic power will be gradual, over a long
period of time, and will be evolutionary
rather than revolutionary. It may also be
profoundly affected by military demands
for nuclear fuel as a material for atomic
bombs. In any case, it seems at present
that atomic energy will only supplement,
and not supplant, present sources of
power.
Align-A-Scope
Aligning, which formerly took hours,
can now be done in a mater of minutes,
and with far greater accuracy, with the
newly developed Align-A-Scope. The first
Align-A-Scope, used in optical tooling.
United States adaptations of the principle
have been in the aviation industry where
exacting tolerances are required due to
modern planes exceeding the speed of
sound, and mass-production tooling
methods are a necessity. In Britain, the
ship-building industry was the first to
employ the method.
IN THE NEWS
(Continued from page 19)
Other industries, including the Los An-
geles Municipal Bureau of Power and
Light, are looking into this new means of
alignment for expensive armatures in
their huge generators. A wide use is
anticipated in many fields as the method
becomes better known.
The principle involved is somewhat
similar to, but simpler than, surveying.
Basic lines of sight are established be-
tween the ends of the object to be align-
ed, together with parallel auxiliary lines
and targets. High-powered telescopes are
employed, with magnifying eyepieces de-
signed to be used either parallel or at
right angles to the line of sight, rotatable
to 360 degrees. An optical micrometer
built in the Align-A-Scope can displace
the "line-of-sight" either vertically or
horizontally. Operating dials control and
indicate this displacement (plus or
minus) within .050. Where microscopic
accuracy is required, this method is said
to render other means obsolete. Inspec-
tors and tool makers can readily obtain
identical correct readings with rapid pre-
cision.
Engineers Study Properties of
Glass for Aircraft Skins
With many components in late model
jets already fabricated from glass fiber
laminate, a supersonic airplane having all-
glass skin is under serious study by air-
craft engineers.
Searing temperatures caused by fric-
tion of air passing over a plane at ultra-
high speeds break down mechanical prop-
erties of present metals. Aircraft engi-
neers are investigating the ability of glass
to withstand such extreme heat.
A leading engineer, head of materials
and process engineering for a West
Coast aircraft company, envisions a future
plane with glass wings, ailerons, stabiliz-
ers and fuselage, put together with glass
rivets and supported by light weight ti-
tanium and stainless steel structures.
This future model, he says, would be
powered by an engine capable of propel-
ling the plane at more than 2,000 m.p.h.
Better Piston Rings
Latest tests conducted on the perform-
ance of piston rings for gasoline and
Diesel engines indicate that those made of
Ductile Iron, a new engineering material
developed by International Nickel in re-
cent years, have wear resistance approxi-
mately one-third better than those made
of the best grades of grey iron which are
normally used for this application. In ad-
dition, these new rings have greater spring
tension which makes them fit more snug-
ly against the wall of the engine's cylin-
der. These new features already have
solved difficult problems in certain types
of high speed engines and offer broad
possibilities of improving the perform-
ance of the internal combustion engine.
Lightweight Power House
Weighing less than 150 pounds, one of
the world's smallest gas turbines delivers
84 horsepower. It's a lightweight wonder
when compared with a 25 H.P. outboard
motor which weighs over 95 pounds.
Used as the source to provide self-start-
ing power for jet aircraft engines, it oper-
ates a pneumatic system on the same
plane as well. To produce this power
from such a small unit, its rotor must turn
at a speed of 40,000 revolutions-per-min-
ute and withstand temperatures up to
1600 degrees Fahrenheit. For these rea-
sons, Inconel "X", a nickel-chromium-
iron alloy which retains its strength at
elevated temperatures was selected for
the components of the rotor.
Douglas Aircraft Builds Static
Test Structures
Shaped like a cathedral, 140 feet long
with the same distance across the tran-
septs, the largest aircraft static test struc-
tures outside of Wright Patterson Air
Force Base is rising at the Douglas Air-
craft Company Long Beach Division.
The $150,000 structure with its $50,-
000 worth of hydraulic jacks and elec-
tronic gages will be able to tear a C-124
to pieces in an orgy of what engineers
call "destructive testing."
With its girders four feet long and two
feet wide, the static test machine can
maintain the severest rigidity while sen-
sitive instruments register the yield of a
member under stress.
The foundation of the static test ma-
chine is 10 feet deep and its concrete,
with embedded steel reinforcing, weighs
3,000 tons. In addition there are 40
concrete piles extending to a depth of 20
feet underground, capable of resisting a
force of 50,000 pounds.

Marion Electrical Instrument Company, prominent meter
manufacturer, embarked on a plan of redesigning their
meters to give improved service. The Marion Meter,
Model 53RN shown here, is a good example of what is
being accomplished.
In redesigning their instruments, Marion worked
closely with Crucible magnet specialists. The recom-
mendation was made to change from Alnico II to Alnico
V for the magnetic alloy used in the meter's D'Arsonval
movement. Then the magnet itself was redesigned. The
overall effect was to reduce the weight of the magnet by
35%, cut the cost V3 . . . and increase the gap flux density
which resulted in a 15% increase in the torque of the
movement. The illustration shows the old and new design.

check temperature control in the conversion of furfural to furan.
Among the most interesting fields for
engineers at Du Pont is the design of
plants and equipment.
It takes ingenuity of a high order
to translate a small-scale laboratory
operation into all-out commerical
production. Design engineers cannot
always use purchasable equipment
to scale up research findings, even
with considerable adaption. About
half of the time at Du Pont, entirely
new equipment must be designed be-
cause of the novelty of the process
developed by research.
For example, a number of unusual
problems were involved in designing
the equipment and plant for a process
in which hexamethy lenediamine, one
of the intermediates for nylon, is
made from furfural, derived from
such agricultural by-products as
corncobs and hulls of cottonseed,
oats and rice.
In this conversion, these steps are in-
volved:

Here are some of the special problems that
were encountered:
1. Design of equipment with close
temperature control for converting fur-
fural to furan. The design finally settled
on employs a large number of tubes con-
taining a catalyst, with a coolant circu-
lated around them. Special sequence

timers were devised for operation of the

2. Design of high-pressure agitated
autoclaves for the hydrogenation of
furan to tetrahydrofuran.
3. Selection of corrosion-resistant
equipment for the hydrochlorination of
tetrahydrofuran to dichlorobutane at
high temperatures.
4. Design of a unique five-step distil-
lation train to obtain high-grade adi-
ponitrile without trace impurities.
Although most of these problems
involve a great deal of chemical en-
gineering, also needed on the design-
ing team were mechanical, electrical,
civil, metallurgical and industrial en-
gineers. Thus design work at Du Pont
is open to men with many types of
training, and there is abundant op-
portunity for all.

Laboratory
Twice the world's present supply of
radium, which if obtainable would cost
$130,000,000, would be needed to equal
in intensity the rays from a powerful ra-
diation source recently installed here at
the Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory,
which is operated for the Atomic Energy
Commission by the General Electric Com-
pany.
So intense is this radiation that it causes
a bluish-white glow in the nine-foot depth
of protective water under which the
source is kept. When the room is darken-
ed, the tank and the surrounding area are
illuminated by this glow.
According to Dr. Kenneth H. King-
don, technical manager of the laboratory,
the source consists of about 2.5 pounds of
a radioactive form of the metal cobalt,
known as cobalt 60. The radiations
emitted are gamma rays or high-energy X
rays.
"The laboratory will use the new in-
stallation in connection with its work on

the design and construction of a full-
scale, land-based model of an atomic
power plant for U. S. Navy submarines,"
Dr. Kingdon explained.
Physical properties of many materials
to be used in constructing such a plant
may be altered by the powerful rays gen-
erated in the atomic reactor, or "furnace."
By lowering samples of these materials
into the water, and exposing them to rays
from the cobalt 60, such effects may be
tested on a small scale, he said. Other
testing of the effects of irradiation on ma-
terials is done in nuclear reactors.
Common glass is one material that is
markedly changed by the rays; it turns a
deep brown. One engineering assistant at
the laboratory took advantage of this to
make a pair of sunglasses, by exposing
an ordinary pair of glasses to the rays
overnight. Such coloration of glass, how-
ever, is not permanent, but gradually
fades out. Baking at a relatively high
temperature very quickly restores the glass
to its original clarity.

"Ordinary cobalt, a metal closely re-
sembling nickel and not radioactive, may
be made radioactive when it is placed in
an atomic reactor and bombarded with
particles called neutrons," Dr. Kingdon
said.
The ordinary form, or isotope, of co-
balt is known as cobalt 59, because there
are 59 particles in each atomic nucleus.
When it is bombarded with neutrons, one
neutron may stick, thus converting the
isotope to the heavier cobalt 60, which is
radio-active. After 5.3 years, half of a
given amount of cobalt 60 changes into
an isotope of ordinary nickel, and gamma
rays are given off as the process takes
place.
The cobalt 60 source was purchased
by the laboratory, at a cost of approxi-
mately §20,000, through the AEC Iso-
topes Division at Oak Ridge, Tenn. This
is the central clearing house for radio-
active isotopes prepared in U. S. atomic
reactors.
Cobalt 60 has also been made available
by the AEC as a source of radiation to be
used by physicians in treating cancer,
and the General Electric X-Ray Depart-
ment has produced a unit in which it
may be safely used. Such sources, how-
ever, are less than a third as large as the
new one in the Knolls laboratory. Radio-
activity is measured in units called curies
(after Madame Curie, the discovered of
radium), Dr. Kingdon said. The new
laboratory source is rated at 3400 curies,
compared with 1000 curies for the medi-
cal units.
He said that the glow produced in the
water by the cobalt is called "Cerenkov"
radiation, after its discoverer, a Russian
physicist, and is due to an interaction be-
tween the gamma rays and the atoms of
which the water is made.
Actually, about 50 watts of energy is
being constantly transmitted from the co-
balt into the water, although it does not
all appear as visible light, Dr. Kingdon
said.

It is a grinding machine — speci-
fically, the new Norton Propeller
Blade Hub Grinder, used to grind
the external surfaces of the hubs of
aircraft propeller blades
A Typical Norton Development
This specialized Norton machine
brings unusual efficiency to propeller
grinding operations. As shown, the
propeller blade is held vertically —
by a workholding fixture on a work
spindle with an anti-friction bearing
— a new departure that avoids the
errors normally caused by deflection
when the blade is held horizontally,
as in conventional methods.
The new Norton grinder has many
other improved features adding up
to greater speed, accuracy and
simplicity of operation. And it re-
quires considerably less floor space
than do horizontal machines
adapted for the same purpose.
The Broadest Line
The Norton line of grinders and
lappers is the most complete offered
by any single manufacturer. It runs
from small machines for the tool
room to high precision, high volume
units for heaviest production line
duty. Equipped with Norton
abrasive wheels these machines form
unbeatable combinations for effi-
cient, economical grinding.
To Future Technicians
As the world's largest manu-
facturers of abrasives and abrasive
products, Norton supplies basic
tools to all industry. To young men
now planning ahead, a career with
Norton offers exceptional opportu-
nities for "making better products to
make other products
better."

upon. With an increase of over
15,000,000 in the number of motor ve-
hicles registered during the past twenty
years and little or no provision made for
the adequate handling of this traffic, it
is high time that some concerted effort is
made to relieve the situation in the inter-
est of the traveling public, and when I
say this I include the automobile owner,
the property owner, the business man,
and the ordinary pedestrian. In fact, I
do not know of any business interest that
would not be benefited by relieving traf-
fic congestion.
Street Cars Are Not Doomed
I do not fear that the motor bus will
replace the electric railway in the larger
cities for, contrary to the opinion of
many people, the revenue pasengers car-
ried per capita in such cities last year
showed material increases over 1910, and
in some instances increases over 1922.
This is of considerable significance when
we remember that in 1910 there were
only 468,000 motor vehicles of all sorts
registered as compared with approxi-
mately 15,000,000 at the end of the year
1923. It also surely is of interest to
know that in 1923 the electric railways
of this country carried approximately
16,000,000,000 passengers, or in other
words more pasengers than in any other
year in their history. This very clearly
demonstrates the economic need and use-
fulness of the industry. It cannot be pos-
sible that an industry that carried this
huge number of passengers in one year—
twelve times as many as were carried by
the steam railroad—is ready for burial.
I have no sympathy for the railway
man who deprecates the automobile and
the motor bus. He is of the dark ages.
Both are instruments of progress, and
while their indiscriminate use on the
streets of our cities has interfered with the
efficiency and usefulness of the electric
railway—the service of which is re-
quired by such a large number of people
—they cannot be denied and should be
used in a proper way for the benefit of
the whole.
I think that most railway operators in
the country are constantly devising ways
and means of increasing the earnings of
their companies, and I believe they are at
the same time not neglecting any operat-
ing efficiency or service that will be of

benefit to the public. It has been and
still is an up-hill job, but progress is be-
ing made. For example:
1. One-man safety cars (which cost
about as much as the ordinary single deck
bus) have been placed in operation by
many companies, and their use generally
has resulted in operating economies to-
gether with improved service to the
public.
2. Traffic studies and surveys have been
made and car routings changed with bene-
fit to the public and savings to the com-
panies.
3. Service during rush hours has been
speeded up by the adoption of skip-stop
schedules and the use of "Pay-as-you-
Leave" cars.
4. Safety zones and loading platforms
have been established in congested dis-
tricts.
5. Motor buses have been operated in
territory not directly served by car lines
and free transfers exchanged.
6. Lighter cars have replaced heavy
equipment and new types of motors bet-
ter adapted to the service have been in-
stalled.
Various other changes and improve-
ments are going on, and a better feeling
of good will on the part of the public
and the authorities has manifested itself
through adjustment of fares to meet in-
creased operating costs and taxes, and
They are, in my opinion, indispensable
and will continue so to be for many
years to come.
In contrast to the other advancements,
the former construction and styles of cars
is still remembered by most of us. For
those of you who are not very familiar
with America's earlier cars and also any-
one else who enjoys seeing pictures of
them, we conclude this article with a re-
print of the "1933 Automobile Review"
first published in the June, 1933, Technic.
1933 AUTOMOBILE REVIEW
Howard M. Jones, '33 M.E.
Chevrolet—To motor minded people
the holiday period means not only the
usual routine of gay events but also the
serious business of previewing the auto
manufacturers' latest models. A more
serious and scrutinizing previewing than
ever before has begun and the blankets
of fine advertising will be removed in
order that Mr. Prospective Buyer can say
to himself, "I have matched my dollar's
value." For all this the manufacturer has
prepared himself and his product.
Chevrolet, a consistent leader in volume
sales, introduced its new, much more
smartly designed models in the middle
of December. Conventional streamlining

likewise the elimination of unfair motor
bus and jitney competition and relief
from burdensome franchise restrictions
have been helpful.
If I have bored you, you must forgive
me—If you do not agree with what I have
said, that is your privilege. I am not a
soothsayer, a prophet or a seer, neverthe-
less I believe that with co-ordination and
the doing away with ruthless competition,
which in the end only mean disaster for
all, the electric railways will "come back."
nite tendencies towards tear-drop design
in the front and rear-end have added
much to its slender rakish beauty. Skirted
fenders and an extended rear body panel
have screened from vision the ugly lines
of frame structure and have made the
car more than a momentary delight to
the eye.

speed up to a maximum well over 70

and the first letters of all major words in
the sub-heading should also be capital-

Since illustrations are an important
part of a report, they should therefore be
placed integrally with the text, not group-
ed in an appendix. All figures, graphs,
and tables should be numbered and ac-
companied by a legend.
When reference is made to illustra-
tions, the number of the figure and the
page on which it appears should be in-
dicated. If the figure is on the same page,
reference can be made by stating the

standing of the report. If the author
wishes to make a special interpretation or
analysis which cannot for reasons of space
be put in the summary he may put such
material in a concluding section. Ordinar-
ily, however, a conclusion is not needed
in technical reports since each section is
self-concluding and the summary is de-
signed to present all the essential find-
ings. A report need not be finished with
the care given a literary work since the
purpose is to present facts and findings
and not to be essentially artistic in con-
struction.
LANGUAGE OF REPORTS
The distinguishing feature of the lan-
guage used in the writing of reports is
impersonality. The third person is invari-
ably used. Personal pronouns (I, you,
we) are avoided so as to remove attention
from the writer of the report and to con-
centrate the reader's attention on the
material presented. This practice promotes
objectivity in writing, and helps to ex-
clude sentiment and opinion in accord-
ance with the fundamental principles of
report writing already set forth.
The report writer should use great
care in the selection of words. The use of
jargon or circumlocution instead of short,
straight-forward speech should be par-
ticularly avoided. Clarity and ease of
understanding should be the guiding
principles for the report writer. Key-
words should be used throughout the text
and outline. The proper selection and use
of words is a very important factor in
achieving the objectivity so important in
report writing.

When the country's largest railroad
loudspeaker system was pianned in the Baltimore
and Ohio's yards near Chicago, the choice of cable to be
used was a key factor. With 37 miles of underground
cable involved, subsequent maintenance costs could con-
ceivably be a major item if any but the best cable were
to be used.
Okonite cable was chosen for this job because of its
superior rubber insulation and the resistance of its
Okoprene sheath to alkalis, acids, oils and other corrosive
substances encountered in railroad yard installations. To-
day, 197 two-way loudspeakers, 50 paging speakers, a
complete telephone and printing telegraph system, and an
independent inter-communicating system between offices
in the yard are operated over Okonite cables in this
network.

says A. J. MESTIER
Massachusetts Institute of Technology Sc. 6.-7943
and now Manager, Syracuse District Office
"T was looking for an engineering job,
1 but I wasn't very sure just what phase
of this broad field would interest me most.
I didn't know whether I wanted straight
engineering, sales engineering, production
or some other branch of industrial engi-
neering.
"Allis-Chalmers Graduate Training
Course gave me a means of working at
various jobs—seeing what I liked best—
and at the same time obtaining a tremen-
dous amount of information about many
industries in a very short time."
Experience Typical
"My experience is typical in many ways.
I started the Graduate Training Course in
1946, after three years in the Army. My
first request was to go to the Texrope
V-belt drive department. From there I
went to the Blower and Compressor de-
partment ; then the Steam Turbine depart-
ment. By the time the course was completed
in 1948, my mind was made up and I knew
I wanted sales work. I was then assigned
to the New York District Office and in
1950 was made manager of the Syracuse
District. The important thing to note is
that all Allis-Chalmers GTC's follow this
same program of picking the departments
in which they want to work.
"Best of all, students have a wide choice,
for A-C builds machines for every basic
industry, such as: steam and hydraulic
turbine generators, transformers, pumps,
motors and other equipment for electric
power; rotary kilns, crushers, grinders,
coolers, screens and other machinery for
mining, ore processing, cement and rock
processing. Then there is flour milling
machinery, electronic equipment and
many others."
A Growing Company
"In addition, new developments and the
continuing growth of the company offer
almost endless opportunities for young
engineers.
"From my experience on the Graduate
Training Course, I believe it is one of the
best conducted in the industry and permits
a young engineer to become familiar with
a tremendous variety of equipment—both
electrical and mechanical—which will
serve him in good stead in his future pro-
fession."

same time, permitted the desired flexibility so that a student
who was unable to obtain four years of high school mathe-
matics may still enter the Engineering College and proceed in
a satisfactory manner. However, it will take these students
who do not have the best preparation somewhat longer time
to complete their graduation requirements. The present pro-
gram of 140 hours comes close to being a four-and-one-half
year program. Under the new rule a student who is thoroughly
prepared in mathematics, chemistry and English should be
able to fulfill the graduation requirements in eight semesters.
Possibly some of the less tangible effects of the rule may
actually prove more important. By placing the emphasis upon
the level of attainment and not simply upon the quantity of
work taken, many students may be encouraged to form more
rapid and more efficient working habits which is always a
prime objective of an educational program, and particularly in
a field such as Engineering where new developments are ac-
complished faster than they can possibly be included in a cur-
riculum.

is gathered throughout the month by the
features staff and organized just before
copy deadline. Jokes and puzzles are gath-
ered from other college magazines, as is
the practice among these magazines. News
of engineering alumni is taken from The
Michigan Alumnus magazine. Current
news notes are obtained from news letters
sent to The Technic by various prominent
industrial corporations. The editorial and
the Dean's Page, both classified as fea-
tures, are written, respectively, by the
Editor-in-chief and Dean George G.
Brown, Dean of the Engineering College.
The second item on the schedule is the
illustrations deadline, October 11. Pic-
tures and drawings must be in to the
illustrations manager early enough so that
cuts may be made on time.
Item number three on the schedule
reads: "Make up ad board, October 18."
The board is a blackboard divided into
forty-eight equal rectangular spaces by
narrow strips of wood. Each of these
spaces represents a page in the magazine
makeup. Before the articles and features
can be placed, the board must be made up
with the advertisements so that the adver-
(Continued from page 36)
tisers may have the best possible locations
in the magazine. In addition to making
up the board, the advertising staff must
see to it that all of the advertising plates
are in before the board makeup.
The galleys, the printer's proofs of the
copy, are returned to The Technic on the
same day the ad board is made up. These
are usually proofread by the try-out staff,
the new members of The Technic whom
the old staff is training. On October 19,
the schedule calls for dummy and in-
struction sheet makeup. The dummy copy
is made up in an old Technic with the
same number of pages as the issue plan-
ned. One of the two copies of galleys is
cut up and arranged in the magazine, al-
lowing space for cuts and advertisements.
When the publication staff has completed
this task, the publications manager and
the Managing Editor compose a sheet of
instructions to accompany the dummy
copy to the printer.
On October 28, the page proofs are
returned by the printer to receive a final
proofreading. This proofreading is not
done by the try-outs, but by the old
staff and they are checked again by the
Managing Editor.
November 7 marks the beginning of
the publicity campaign. Before this day,
the publicity staff has prepared posters
and notices for the coming issue and had
them approved by the Editor-in-Chief.
On November 7, they put the notices up
in prominent places in East and West
Engineering buildings.
The magazines are delivered by the
printer on November 10. On November
11 the circulation staff goes into action,
sending out subscription copies and pre-
paring a sales schedule. Open sales begin
November 13 at 9 a.m. and end the next
day at 4 P.M.
The publication of a college magazine
is not difficult, but students who have
never done this type of work must be
trained; consequently, the staff has a
double job. They must attend to their
tasks in the publication of The Technic
and train the try-outs. The compensation
for the time they spend in doing this
double job is a feeling of accomplish-
ment and a great deal of training above
and beyond the ordinary engineering cur-
riculum.
Elimination of wasteful friction is a constant battle con-
fronting Industry. Out on the job . . . irrespective of your
engineering role . . . you'll be coming to grips with this
problem.
In the past, Industry has learned to rely upon aCSlF for
practical solutions to anti-friction bearing problems.
In the future — more than ever before — engineers can
look to ffiCSIF for the finest in bearings, plus help in putting
the right bearing in the right place. "»«

Ever since the advent of closed cars,
motorists, in order to enjoy fresh air have
been obliged to endure the discomforts
of drafts blowing upon them or to remain
with windows closed and endure the un-
healthfulness of stuffy air within the car.
A study of closed car ventilation was
made and Buick now offers "no-draft
ventilation." By placing a pane of glass
that is free to be moved about a vertical
axis at the front of each side window
gentle currents of fresh air are contin-
ually conduced within the car without
producing noticeable drafts. This feature
although detracting somewhat from the
finished beauty of the car, should be a
helpful selling factor.

of engine smoothness with the necessary
stability. New automatic inertia type
shock absorbers controlled by floating
valves actuated by the movement of the
chassis are claimed to maintain riding
comfort over all roads at high speed.
The automatic clutch, or "wizard con-
trol" introduced last year, has been im-
proved by the addition of a new pendu-
dum valve that automatically controls the
engagement of the clutch insuring smooth
pick-up and instantaneous change from
free wheeling to conventional drive. By
employing ball detents instead of plung-
ers, the silent-second gear shifting ar-
rangement has been improved consider-
ably. A starter button has replaced the
old style floor pedal and new headlights
which direct a beam on the right hand

to replace the present standard single
beam lights.
Packard
This builder of the finer type of motor
car transportation, made internationally
famous by its recent achievement in sup-
plying a successful power plant for Gar
Wood's Miss America Xth, has scored
another impressive hit by presenting the
most conservative streamlined cars in the
recent New York Auto Show, the Eight,
the Super Eight, and the Twin Six.
The Eight and the Super Eight have
been stepped up in horse power from 110
and 135 to 120 and 145 respectively . . .
the twin six develops 160 horsepower.
The mechanical factor largely responsible
for this increased power is the adoption
of a new dual-downdraft carburation sys-
tem that gives all the advantages of two
separate carburetors without the necessity
of maintaining finely balanced adjust-
ments.
Another unique mechanical improve-
ment on the new Packards for 1933 is the
application of the Bendix-BK vacuum-
operated power brake system, a braking
system that is positive in action, and
when brakes are applied for instant emer-
gencies the driver does not experience a
swerving of the car—the drum pressure
on all four brake drums is evenly and
automatically controlled.
In brief, other improvements added to
this new group are: three point engine
mountings, more rigid connecting rods
with cooling fins, a better system of
cylinder lubrication, new mufflers with
greater silence and less back pressure,
dual coils for positive ignition at high
speeds, improved syncro-mesh transmis-
sion with very quiet operating gears at
all four speeds, and lastly but not of
lesser importance is the greatly improved
shock absorber action which gives abso-
lute ride control when necessary on trav-
eling over rough roads.
DeSoto
DeSoto automotive engineers have
created for the motor buying public this
year not only one of America's outstand-
ing low priced sixes, but they have em-
bodied many interesting mechanical fea-
tures into this smartly designed car. With
a low price range beginning at $695.00,
this new car will no doubt make a strong
showing in the medium-low priced group
for 1933.
One of the main body improvements to
be found in this new line is the deluxe
appearance of the interiors. The uphol-
stery is very pleasing and well contoured
to afford greater seating comfort. All in-
terior trim is of the panel type and finish-
ed in two distinctive tones.
A fine work in highly decorative design
is exemplified on the new DeSoto's in-
strument panel. Its centerpiece is an extra
large speedometer.
Mechanically the cars have many new
features. Noteworthy features are the
new automatic choke, manifold heat con-
trol, a better transmission equipped with
quiet helical gears, high speed exhaust
valve seats that prolong the time before
valve grinding becomes necessary.
The power plant has a one eighth inch
more stroke than last year's engine, and
its new dimensions are 314 by 4%. It
develops 79 h.p. with a 6.2 to 1 Red
Head type engine.

Chemical engineering practice may be grouped broadly into research and develop-
ment, process design, manufacturing, technical service, and sales. Various aspects of
all these groupings are touched upon in teaching chemical engineering, but improve-
ment of ability in development and design is emphasized.
Equipment such as the evaporator shown above, is operated by the students to
gain familiarity with large scale equipment, to conduct research studies on fundamentals
of engineering, and to obtain data necessary to design of other units. Similar equipment
in many fields is included throughout the laboratories, and corresponds to the pilot
plants found in many industrial laboratories.

THE MENTOR SYSTEM
This year there was a change made in the Engineering
curriculum which few people probably noticed. This was
the revision of the freshman mentor-assembly program. Al-
though this change will not affect many engineers above
the freshman level, it may interest you to compare the new
program with the old.
The entire mentor program is now lead by Professor C.
Spooner of the Naval Architecture Department, who pre-
viously was one of the mentors.
The most outstanding change in the program was the
number of freshmen allotted to each mentor. Previous to
this year, the number has been as high as twenty-five or
thirty. This year, no one mentor has a group of more than
fifteen freshmen. This certainly should mean a more effi-
cient mentor system. Previously it was almost impossible
for a mentor to keep in contact with all the members of his
group. Without this contact, freshmen often find it much
harder to adjust to their new environment. The only prob-
lem which may arise is that of finding an abundant supply
of mentors which may be needed if the freshmen enroll-
ment should suddenly rise sharply.
According to the present schedule, this year's program
will attempt to acquaint the engineering freshmen with a
greater number of the campus activities outside of the
Engineering School. This will be done by inviting speakers
from different University functions such as the employ-
ment bureau, lecture series and concert series to speak dur-
ing the assembly periods. I believe this method of using
representative speakers from each of the groups will be
much more informative and interesting than the former
method of one man trying to present all the functions. Of
course, the success of this new system depends somewhat
on the abilities of each of the speakers. Some student speak-
ers are very poor as interest raisers.
Another change in the mentor system is the handling of
the five and tenth week grades of the freshmen. Starting
this year, the grades will be made available to the students
in the seventh and twelfth week's of the semester. The
delay of the second grade report from the tenth to the
twelfth week should give the student a better idea of
what his grades are nearer to the end of the semester.
Another change in the handling of the grades is that
starting this semester, they will be made available in the
morning instead of the late afternoon. This should be an
aid to both the students and the mentors. When the grades
were handed out at five o'clock the only things the fresh-
men were interested in were getting his grades and getting
home for supper. Thus, the mentor was deprived of one of
his best opportunities to discuss with the student just how
he was getting along at the University. Also most stu-
dents did not care to take time to stay and talk with their
mentor when they knew their supper was waiting for
them. Now, with the passing out of the grades starting
in the morning, the mentors and students both should
have a better chance to sit down for a few minutes and
get acquainted.
Previous to this semester, students, after their first year,
had a hard time trying to arrange their schedules with
their mentors because the mentors quite often were not in
the same department of the Engineering school as the stu-
dent. Thus, he could not be of much assistance in helping
the student make a choice of classes. With the introduc-
tion of this new system, the administration should try to
correlate the departments of the mentors and the fresh-
men. In this way the mentor can be a greater help to the
student after his freshman year.
With the reduction in size of the mentor groups, it
seems quite possible that the mentors should be able to take
on some added responsibility. Perhaps with a slight change
in the classification program, mentors could be given the
job of helping students select their choice of studies for
their next semester. It may be too large a job to do this
for all Engineering students but if it could be done with at
least the freshmen and sophomore classes, it certainly
would speed up the classification program.
With the introduction of the new freshman assembly-
mentor program, a great many improvements have been
made; however, there still remain a few areas of improve-
ment wherein the task of the freshman who is trying to ad-
just himself to his new environment can be made easier.

HERE is one of the busiest machines in our re-
search laboratories. It is a constant-pressure
test lathe that quickly provides an indication of
how fast a steel can be machined.
This unique testing device consists of a standard
lathe fitted with special control equipment by
which the horizontal pressure on the cutting tool
is kept constant during the machining operation.
By actually machining a test bar on this lathe and
measuring the number of revolutions necessary to
advance the cutting tool exactly two inches, we ob-
tain—in a matter of minutes—a precise record of
the steel's machinability.
Before this development, the normal way to test
machinability was to machine a sample of steel
until the cutting tool failed. This sometimes took
days and often required more steel than was avail-
able. Now, with the constant-pressure lathe, many
steel compositions can be accurately checked in
that time.
Typical of what this has meant to steel users is
our development of MX Free-machining Bar Stock.
Bar stock is used in producing the millions of
machine parts that are made on screw machines—
those high-speed automatic machines that can
simultaneously perform many operations such as
drilling, forming, threading, chamfering and tap-
ping at a rate of 1000 or more parts per hour.
Here, machinability is of first importance, and
often spells the difference between profit and loss.
So when we set out to give the screw machine
industry steels that would have the utmost in ma-
chinability, we called on the constant-pressure
test lathe to speed up this research. With its help,
hundreds of compositions were quickly and ac-
curately screened. The result was MX—the fastest-
cutting Bessemer screw stock yet developed, one
that has enabled many screw machine operators
not only to increase production and reduce tool
wear but to cut their costs as well.
The constant-pressure test is a good example of
the many research projects sponsored by United
States Steel. In the field and in the laboratory.

Prepared by Nuclear Power Division
Bureau of Ships
There are three basic types of reactors;
production reactors, which make fission-
able material, research reactors, which are
expensive scientific tools, and useful
power producing reactors. The develop-
ment of nuclear reactors in this country
is specifically the responsibility of the
Division of Reactor Development, the
Director of which is Dr. L. R. Hafstad.
This Division* is concerned with the de-
velopment of all types of reactors. Since
our interest as engineers lies more in the
direction of the useful power producing
units, and since that is the field in which
we are most familiar, this paper will
confine itself to power producing reactors.
Because of the immediate demand of the
military for reactors to propel ships and
aircraft without primary consideration be-
ing given to economics, there are several
projects aimed at the immediate short
term problems of military vehicle propul-
sion. Since the important future of nu-
clear energy is in the economic generation
of power, we find great interest in at-
tempting to extrapolate from where we
are today to where we will be when all
the economic elements are considered. A
number of electric utilities and engineer-
ing firms are cooperating with the Atomic
Energy Commission in making studies of
the economic applications.
Before discussing nuclear power plants,
there are a few physical concepts which
should be understood. The first of these
is the idea that from the power plant
standpoint, the nuclear reactor just re-
places the fire in the fire-box of a con-
ventional boiler. Therefore, from the
thermo-dynamic standpoint, a nuclear
power plant is not materially different
than a conventional coal or oil fired
power plant. There are, however, some
most significant differences between nu-
clear power plants and other power
plants.
These problems are caused by the phys-
ical fact that the heat released as a conse-
quence of the process of nuclear fission in
the reactor is intimately and completely
coupled with the release of tremendous
quantities of penetrating nuclear radia-
tions. These radiations bring with them
* Division of Reactor Development of the
Atomic Energy Commission.
problems of radiation damage, shielding,
and special limitations on the types of
materials which can be used in reactors.
Another factor of problems involved
in nuclear engineering is the tremendous
range in magnitude of the quantities with
which the engineer is constantly dealing.
Since most of the common units of meas-
urement were established before the so-
called science of nucleonics was heard of,
practically every unit of measure in nu-
clear engineering is either a micro-some-
thing or a mega-something. For example,
instead of measuring radiation intensity
in terms of curies, a term derived from
the radio-activity of one gram of radium,
we find most of our radiation problems
measured in terms of megacuries, (mil-
lion curies). On the other hand, the unit
in which the nuclear physicist specifies
the ability of a given material to absorb
neutrons, the so-called cross-section, is an
area measured in what the nuclear physi-
cist called barns. This unit, equivalent to
10-24cm2 of area, was so called because
it was not as big as a barn door. Another
associated idiosyncracy of the nuclear
engineering business is the wide use of
both the metric and English systems of
measurement which, to the average engi-
neer brought up in the English system, is
a bit baffling at first.
Notwithstanding the above wide varia-
tion between nuclear engineering and the
engineering field in general, most of the
problems which must be solved fall well
within the province of the mechanical
engineering profession. All of these are
susceptible to solution through experi-
ment and calculation with a relative high
degree of precision. We find today a con-
siderable number of engineers of various
backgrounds engaged in the design of
nuclear power plants and their associated
equipment. As might be expected, there
are many specialties in this field just as
there are in the field of mechanical engi-
neering in general. The various types of
engineering problems involved range
from shielding and its associated cousin
of remote maintenance through the metal-
lurgical problems involved in new and
exotic materials, and in the production of
both new and common material with ex-
ceptional degrees of purity and accuracy.
Problems of radiation damage by various
materials are of constant concern, as are
heat transfer problems. Indeed, it is safe
to say that heat transfer constitutes the
central theme about which most reactor
designs revolve. Even a nuclear physicist
must bow to the requirements of heat
transfer at times. The electronics and
servo-mechanisms engineers also have
plenty to keep them busy, with detecting
and indicating instruments and control
systems. The chemical engineer has a very
important part in solving the intricate
problems involved in the reprocessing of
extremely radioactive wastes. If we devote
just a little time to each of these, we will
see where the engineering problems actu-
ally exist.
Considering shielding first, since not
only is it the principal new feature in-
volved resulting from the extreme radio-
activity to be handled but also in the case
of the mobile plants, it is a particularly
difficult problem. For stationary power
plants where there is plenty of space, and
where size and weight are not particu-
larly important, we find ordinary ma-
terials such' as concrete, iron, and water
used for shielding, with economic con-
sideration usually determining. In mo-
bile reactors, for both ship and aircraft
application, we find the principal empha-
sis being placed on weight and space so
that materials of more unusual nature are
being investigated. Some of these ma-
terials which have the best properties as
shielding material do not have good struc-
tural properties, so the techniques of their
possible utilization in reactor shielding
structures is a matter of concern to the
nuclear engineer. Another feature of
nuclear power plants associated with
shielding is the high degree of leak tight-
ness required of the coolant systems
which must contain radioactive reactor
coolant. A degree of leak tightness and
reliability that is unusual in the case of
large systems by ordinary engineering
standards is required. In the case of most
of the reactor coolants used, the leakage
of a very few cubic centimeters, (most of
you may recognize this unit of liquid
measure as about a jigger) will release
enough radioactivity to the surround-

Introduction
The tremendous expansion in the size
and productiveness of the engineering
profession has been due, in a large meas-
ure, to the ability of research and develop-
ment engineers to enlist other engineers
for special tasks or services related to
their basic problems. It was not so many
years ago that an engineer was the engi-
neer—he was charged with responsibility
for all engineering work on a project.
This was possible because the end result
of his engineering work was usually a
single unit or instrument which operated
without "tie-in" or reference to other
equipment. He found time somehow to
solve all of the engineering problems that
Robert T. Hamlett
neers, industrial engineers, etc., etc. What
has happened? Simply that the individual
engineer can no longer carry all the bur-
dens of the job of engineering a system
or even a single instrument which ties
rise to still another field of specialization
within the engineering profession—that
of technical writing (Fig. 1). The prod-
ucts of this new field are instruction
books, training manuals, engineering re-
ports, technical data sheets, and many
other types of technical information. The
workers in this field are variously refer-
red to as technical writers, engineering
writers, specification writers, technical re-
port writers, etc. This author prefers to
call the workers in this field publications
engineers in keeping with other well-
established titles such as standards engi-
neer, test engineer, field service engineer,
etc. This new title will be used through-
out the article.

What Is a Publications Engineer?
The principal reason why this author
prefers the new title publications engineer
to that of technical writer is that it more
clearly designates the duties of such a
worker, and also places him in a proper
professional status with fellow engineers,
where he rightfully belongs. For he is an
engineer first and a writer second. The
term technical writer, as commonly ac-
cepted, refers to a person who writes
material on technical subjects to various

concerned with the actual publication
processes and problems.
The publications engineer is an engi-
neering specialist who relieves other engi-
neers of the major portion of the respon-
sibility for production of all publications
required as a result of the engineers'
work (Fig. 2). The publications engineer
writes technical material, plans and directs
preparation of copy, and carries through
on all details concerned with actual pro-
duction of the publication. It is necessary
to repeat that he is first an engineer, then
a deficiency which will handicap him
throughout his entire career.
There is no doubt that some engineers
cannot write well—but some lawyers,
some accountants, and some doctors can-
not write well! Some doctors do not de-
velop a pleasing "bedside" manner, so
they become fine surgeons or specialists.
So some engineers do not write well, or
simply do not have the time to write
well—and because of this, other engi-
neers now find an interesting and well-
paid profession.
The publications engineer must be an

a writer, and finally a publications man.
Engineers have always labored under
the stigma that they cannot write well. It
is a common attitude, even in pre-college
education, to assume that because the stu-
dent is superior in mathematics he must
be inferior in English. This affects the
student's attitude, and he very naturally
uses it as an excuse for not seriously
studying the subject in which he is pre-
judged to be inferior. When the "su-
perior" math student goes to engineering
school it is a foregone conclusion that
engineer who has writing aptitude. This
aptitude may have never become very
obvious because of the lack of encourage-
ment received during his education. The
author has seen many engineers, who felt
certain that they were below average in
writing aptitude, develop into excellent
writers of technical material. No one can
doubt that the engineering profession
would be in a much better position if
there were more effective writers amongst
engineers. (The same might be said for
effective speakers.)
hydraulics, etc. He is constantly chal-
lenged to describe something about which
he knows practically nothing. But with
his basic engineering education under his
hat, he tackles each unknown with some
confidence that he can understand and
interpret the facts for others who may
know more or less about it than he does.
Many fine technical descriptions result
when engineers who are educated in one
field begin to write on subjects in other
engineering fields—they use analogies
which greatly aid the reader in applying
the description to his own experience.
The publications engineer must have a
working knowledge of the advantages and
disadvantages of many types of repro-
duction processes such as spirit duplica-
tion, mimeograph, Photostat, blueline and
blueprint, Ozalid, offset printing, and
letterpress printing. He is familiar with
type faces, paper stock, cover materials,
binding methods, etc. He understands the
problems involved in production of copy
by typewriters, Varitypers, typesetting,
and Phototype. He has a practical knowl-
edge of the arts of photography and re-
touching, and he guides technical illustra-
tors in visualizing and rendering special
illustrations for use with his written
words.
All of his talents and acquired knowl-
edge are combined in the process of pre-
paring a publication that must meet gov-
ernment or commercial specifications cov-
ering content, format, practicability, and
literary standards. He is at the same time
an engineer, a writing specialist, a publi-
cations expert, and a student of psy-
chology!

writing projects, he finds the variety of

JESSE ORMONDROYD
Professor of Engineering Mechanics
Leonardo Da Vinci was born just 500
years ago in the town of Vinci near
Florence, Italy, in the midst of that explo-
sively energetic period called the Renais-
sance. He has been acclaimed as the most
universal genius ever born in our West-
ern Civilization. For that honor he com-
petes only with Aristotle of ancient
Greece and Benjamin Franklin of Colon-
ial America. To place him in historical
context he was born one year after
Columbus was born and one year before
Constantinople fell to the Turks. Thus he
was born a contempory of the future dis-
coverer of the New World and just be-
fore the official end of the great Roman
empire.
He was a handsome man with a radiant
personality, bursting with energy and
curiosity which he directed to so many
different fields that a list of them sounds
like a catalogue. He is chiefly famous as a
painter. His paintings, "The Last Supper"
and "Mona Lisa" are still known, by
name at least, to everyone who can read
a newspaper. He was also a great sculp-
tor, an archaeologist, and anatomist; per-
haps the first to study the human anatomy
by careful dissection of cadavers, at a
time when it was considered a serious
crime to do it. Our interest in him here
lies in the fact that he was one of the first
modern experimental and theoretical
physicists, a military, civil, and mechani-
cal engineer and a prolific inventor of re-
markably modern devices. With all this
he was, unfortunately, one of humanity's
greatest tradegies. His interests spread
over so many fields, in all of which he
was a perfectionist, that he has left us
very few material monuments to his uni-
versal genius. Only a few paintings, some
rumors of his great talents buried in the
writings of his contemporaries, and, for-
tunately, several copious notebooks writ-
ten by his own hand survive to remind
us that he really lived. He started many
things and finished very few of them.
Although he could have been the
father of modern experimental science if
he had devoted his whole attention to
that subject, he had, in fact, no influence
at all on that development. His note-
books, which contain the complete record
Jesse Ormondroyd
of his activities in archaeology, anatomy,
physics, engineering and invention,
waited for three hundred years before
they were studied critically and published
for the world to read. By that time all
that he had done in those fields had been
recreated in better and more complete
form by many lesser men who had re-
stricted their activities to single fields.
Leonardo's notebooks are written, curi-
ously, from right to left with numerous
abbreviations so they have given scholars
great difficulties in their attempt to de-
cipher the contents. But, since Leonardo
was an artist, he filled the notes with
numerous sketches so that we have a very
clear idea of the devices he invented and
the experiments he made. His notebooks
indicate clearly that his scientific interests
were all inspired by very practical prob-
lems. His outlook was closer to that of
the modern engineer than to that of the
modern theoretical physicist.
Living in an age which still mainly de-
pended on the energy and strength of
human beings and animals to get its work
done he showed a life long interest in
devices which permitted men and animals
to lift and transport large weights. His
notebooks are filled with ingenious sys-
tems of levers, pulleys, gear trains, and
inclined planes. Most of the combinations
shown were original inventions far in
advance of anything of the kind used in
his day. He realized clearly, too, that the
great enemies of these devices were fric-
tion and the possibility of breakage. So
he studied friction and lubrication, in-
venting the concept of the coefficient of
friction. He also studied the breaking
strength of ropes, columns, and beams.
He realized clearly that the universal
dream of all men to get some effect with
no effort was futile. Here is his opinion
on perpetual motion and the alchemists
useless efforts:
"Oh speculators on perpetual mo-
tion, how many vain projects of
the like character you have created!
Go and be the companions of the
searchers after gold!"
In the military field he invented the
machine gun, the tank and demountable
bridges for crossing rivers. As a civil
engineer he was interested in canals,
means of diverting the courses of streams,
and roads.
Leonardo was a scientific pioneer in
aviation. He invented the hot-air balloon,
the parachute, and the airplane. His air-
plane, shown in great detail in the note-
books, used flapping wings powered by
the muscular energy of the pilot. Of
course it never flew.
In the pursuit of the solution of these
practical problems Leonardo did a great
deal of work which would be classified as
theoretical today. He reduced all the quan-
titative calculations in pulleys, gears, and
incline planes to the law of lever, gen-
eralizing on Archimedes law of the lever.
This type of generalization is the essence
of scientific thinking. He used the con-
cept of resolution of forces into compon-
ents and of compounding vectorially dis-
placements, velocities and forces. He fore-
shadowed many of Galileo's discoveries
in dynamics. His notes show that he per-
ceived the law of inertia, the law of
equality between action and reaction. He
saw that force was a concept and not an
entity perceivable by any of the five
senses. However, he missed the clear cut
kinematic idea of acceleration. He studied
falling body motion and the motion of
spheres rolling down inclined planes. He
fore-saw the effect of the rotation of the

the balloon rises, temperature of the

automatic transmitter, and in this way,
the balloon's altitude can be calculated.
Then there's the one about dew point—
the cooled atmospheric temperature at
which water vapor begins to form in the
air. G-E instrument engineers put the
principle to work in a device known as a
dewpoint recorder. The instrument is used
to help give a spring-water taste to drink-

Philadelphia, Pa. It gives a continuous

The first basement of the Randall
Physics Building houses the cyclotron
which the Physics Department uses for
nuclear research. The cyclotron consists of
a large vertical magnet between whose
poles is a tank evacuated to a pressure of
one billionth of an atmospheric. Inside
the tank are two hollow D-shaped elec-
trodes called "dees" which are three
inches apart. Connected to the dees is an
oscillating circuit of high frequency,
which can produce more frequency than
the radio station WJR in Detroit. In the
center of the tank is an electric arc which
breaks apart heavy hydrogen (deuterium)
molecules and strips the electrons off the
resulting deuterium atoms. The remain-
ing nuclei of these stripped atoms are
called deuterons and are one type of
particle accelerated in the cyclotron.
The oscillating voltage and the magnet
cause the positively charged deuterons to
make a semi-circular path in one dee.
The deuterons are speeded up as they
jump the gap betwen the dees and con-
tinue their circular path in the other dee.
Each time around they make larger cir-
cles until they approach the outermost
edge of the dee. There they are split off
by a knife edge and are drawn out of the
tank by a deflecting plate maintained at
50,000 volts.
In present experiments, the deuterons
stream through an evacuated tube and
into an evacuated chamber containing a
target in the form of a thin foil of a
substance such as vanadium. This target is
bombarded by the stream of deuterons,
and those deuterons getting close enough
to a nucleus in a target break apart into
their constituent proton and neutron. The
neutron enters the target while the pro-
ton is scattered at an angle. One meas-
ures the numbers of protons scattered at
the different angles. This "angular dis-
tribution" of protons is in turn the key
to the behavior of the neutron entering
the target. In particular, the rate of angu-
lar rotation of the neutron about the cen-
ter of the nucleus can be deduced, and,
therefore, something of the character of
the particular nucleus in that it is willing
to accept the neutron with rate of rota-
tion. Not all rates of angular rotation are

have subsequently been verified experi-
mentally by the Michigan cyclotron
group, and by other groups in England.
The agreement is not perfect, but the type
of disagreement is itself interesting and
tells still more about the target nucleus.
The description of the nuclei obtained
with the aid of these experiments to date
agrees remarkably well with the simplified
"shell model" of the nucleus devised by
Maria Mayer, a nuclear physicist of the
Argonne National Laboratory.
The "shell model" assumes at the start
that any proton or neutron can travel any-
where within the nucleus of an atom
without colliding with other protons or
neutrons. Since this seems incompatible
with other known facts about the neu-
trons and protons, the brilliant success of
the "shell model' 'poses a fine paradox.
The resolution of this paradox is certainly
a primary aim of continuing research with
the cyclotron.

JAMES P. ROGERS
INTRODUCTION
In 1859, with the completion of the
first drilled oil well, an intense interest
in the origin of petroleum was born. Since
that time the problem has perplexed
many intellectual giants to the point of
complete frustration. V. C. Illing says
on the subject, "Each year the crop of
new papers adds to the fearsome pile
threatening to bury the subject by the
very dead weight of diversified opinion,
and the earnest student, anxiously search-
ing for enlightenment, gets lost in the
maze of conflicting opinion."' These
opinions do have some order, however.
All may be grouped into one of two
types; those that demand an organic
source for petroleum hydrocarbons, and
those that insist on inorganic sources of
those same compounds.
INORGANIC ORIGIN
Constituents of meteorites and the an-
alysis of the spectra of other planets give
conclusive evidence that methane and
other hydrocarbons exist in large quan-
tities on every planet. If the results of
these analyses are applied quantitatively
to our own planet, the earth's oil, dis-
covered and undiscovered, may amount to
something like 500 million barrels, far
more than today's assumed reserves.
Those with contrary opinion ask, "If
this hydrocarbon content of the earth's
core is so outstanding, why is it that
seeps and gas flows are very common in
sedementary rocks and practically un-
known in the igneous varieties?" Three
theories have been proposed by those who
support inorganic origin of petroleum.
All three assume no organic aid whatso-
ever.
The Carbide Theory
The carbide theory is based on the fact
that in the chemical laboratory analyses,
carbides of calcium, iron, and several
other elements produce hydrocarbon
products when in contact with water. It
is assumed that great quantities of cal-
cium, aluminum, iron, and similar car-
1 Illing, V. C, "Geology of Petroleum,"
journal of the Institute of Petroleum Tech-
nologists, vol. 21 (1935), Tulsa: J. I. P. T.,
1935.
bides exist at depth, and that the action of
hot water upon these carbides forms
liquid and gaseous hydrocarbon com-
pounds which rise upward through fis-
sures and point cracks and are condensed
and collected in the sedimentary beds
above. This theory has been strongly sup-
ported by some able chemists, but is not
advocated by many geologists.
The Limestone, Gypsum, and Hot
Water Theory
This theory is advocated by some geol-
ogists and chemists alike. In laboratory in-
vestigations, the action of heated water
upon limestone and gypsum produces the
constituents of petroleum. The exact
chemical processes have not been fully
explained, but it is certain that lime-
stone, gypsum and water contain all the
necessary elements for the production of
petroleum. Under certain conditions of
heat and pressure, it is not impossible
that oil may be formed as thus postulated.
The Volcanic Theory
The volcanic theory is based upon the
fact that gases given off from some vol-
canoes carry small percentages of hydro-
carbons. These gases are supposedly of
deep-seated origin and carry the products
of chemical reactions that occur in the
earth. It is assumed that the gases are
condensed before reaching the surface and
thus forming petroleum.
ORGANIC ORIGIN
Almost every scientist who advocates
organic origin of petroleum believes that
the following sequences of events take
place in this origin:
1. Deposition of the organic materials
in a silt or sand in marine or fresh water
not over six hundred feet deep.
2. Deposition of other inorganic sedi-
ments above the organic until a thick
covering is formed.
3. Protection of the organic constitu-
ents from oxidation, leaching, and pick-
ling, by the overlying sediments.
4. Action of bacteria, chemicals, pres-
sure from the overlying sediments, and
heat to introduce the distillation of the
organic materials into the hydrocarbons
of the paraffin series.
Animal Theories
The real question among the expon-
ents of organic origin is whether the con-
stituents of the sediments mentioned in
the preceeding paragraph are vegetable or
animal. Animals suggested as constituents
are fish, oyster, scallops, mollusks, corals,
and an infinitesimal number of micro-
scopic forms. At the present time, parts
of the globe are covered with organisms
that could produce hydrocarbons in quan-
tity sufficient for comparison with oil re-
serves under exploitation today. It is com-
pletely possible that even the microscopic
forms such as the foraminifera and ra-
diolaria could accumulate in sufficient
numbers to form a petroleum base which
would be exploitable after subsurface dis-
tillation.
Fish deserve special mention as pos-
sible sources of petroleum. Their physical
make-up has a greater hydrocarbon con-
tent than some of their chordate, land-liv-
ing relatives. In addition, the "oils"
of fishes are of a type that is very nearly
that of the chemical components of the
more basic petroleum compounds. To con-
sider the fish as a source of oil, however,
one must believe in catastrophic accumu-
lation, and the source sediments show no
indication of such conditions.
Bacterial action is summarized very
adequately by Russell in the following
paragraph:
Role of Bacteria. Since petroleum
has evidently originated from the organic
matter in sediments, it is worth while to
consider how this organic matter accumu-
lates, how it is affected by bacterial action,
and how the various types of organic mat-
ter may be recognized. Organic matter is
attacked by two kinds of bacteria, aerobic
and anaerobic. The relation of organic
matter to bacteria and source rocks has
been discussed by Hammar. . . . The an-
aerobic bacteria use the free oxygen dis-
solved in water to oxidize the organic
matter. They act on dead organisms
while they are falling through the water,
and if the bottom is well supplied with
oxygen, they may continue to consume
the organic matter after it has come to
rest. Aeorbic bacteria would continue to
consume the organic matter until it was

about scoring and cutting rule steel
Some examples of the many shapes of bends needed
Scoring and cutting rule steel is a cold-rolled
specialty»steel for use in preparing dies for cutting
paper, leather, rubber and other materials.
It is a pre-tempered product manufactured by
skilled workmen, using precision rolling and hard-
ening equipment, to close limits for chemistry,
grain size and hardness. This product must also be
capable of meeting intricate bend requirements in
the hardened and tempered condition.
This specialty is furnished with round edges and
in coil form to the rule manufacturer who grinds
the edges — the one edge square and the other to a
knife edge as well as cutting the material into de-
sired lengths. This is sold to a die-maker who bends
the rule to the required shape. This is then the
nucleus of a pre-hardened die, which when properly
brazed and supported is used to cut out material for
display cards — aircraft parts — pocketbooks —
wallets — gloves — gaskets — washers.

ings to make the area uninhabitable. An
ordinary steam power plant is subject to
copious leakage as compared to this
standard.
Valve packing glands, pump shaft
seals, pipe flanges, and turbine shaft
seals, usually all leak to the extent that
it is necessary to add makeup of many
gallons of water per day to the boiler. A
reactor coolant system simply must not
leak at all. The heat exchangers, piping,
reactor container, and other system com-
ponents which make up this necessarily
impervious envelope to contain the cool-
ant generally may be of a heavy, rugged
structure where in good engineering prac-
tice will insure great integrity. However,
it is necessary to transmit through this en-
velope certain motions, pressures, or con-
siderable amounts of energy, and the
points at which these pass through the
envelope constitute points of weakness.
A great amount of effort is being applied
to achieving the necessary soundness and
reliability at these points.
Another problem associated with radio-
activity and shielding is that of main-
tenance. In the development of shipboard
nuclear power plants, we are facing some
extremely difficult problems in insuring
that we can do something about all parts
of the system in case it becomes neces-
sary. Sometimes this involves various in-
genious mechanical devices to perform
remote operations. It always means think-
ing about how you are going to repair
something when you design it, for once it
is radioactive, it is pretty tough to take it
back to the machine shop for alterations.
It was mentioned that there are a great
many new and exotic materials which are
emplovd in connection with the design
of nuclear reactors. The need for these
comes from the requirement that struc-
tural materials, heat transfer fluids, shield-
ing materials, and nuclear fuel and mod-
erating materials must have certain nu-
clear properties in addition to the chemi-
cal and physical properties which they
normally require. We find a number of
materials that have been, in the past,
relatively rare and little known from the
standpoint of engineering properties, now
being used in varying degrees. Just to
indicate the scope that is covered, and to
mention only a few of the many actually
used, we find that uranium, thorium, and
plutonium are of interest as fuel and
fertile materials; beryllium, sodium
hydroxide, heavy water, and graphite are
(Continued from page 11)
of interest as moderating materials; water,
sodium, lithium, lead, and gallium are
considered as heat transfer fluids, and
zirconium, aluminum, titanium, and some
of the newer cobalt, nickel, and tungsten
alloys are considered for various mechani-
cal applications. New materials are found
at every turn.
A further aspect of the material ques-
tion is the necessity for a high degree of
purity in reactor structural materials and
coolants. Again, because of the high ab-
sorption of neutrons by certain impurities
in metallic structural materials, or because
of the corrosive or contaminating quali-
ties of impurities in heat transfer fluids,
new engineering problems are encounter-
ed in attaining the required degree of
purity.
The various materials which are used in
nuclear reactors are subjected to various
degrees of damage from the radiations to
which they are subjected, just as human
beings might be. The subject of radiation
damage of solids and fluids is another one
of these halfway fields lying between the
physicist, the metallurgist, the mechanical
engineer, and the chemist. We have just
begun to scratch the surface of these prob-
lems and their interrelationship with each
other.
It was pointed out that heat transfer is,
in a sense, the heart of the nuclear reactor
problem. We find a number of new heat
transfer fluids being developed and old
ones being used under unusual conditions.
These problems arise from one of the
idiosyncrasies of nuclear reactors when
used in the production of useful power
that seems rather paradoxical to most en-
gineers. To a first approximation, the
amount of energy that may be released
within a reactor, and hence the amount
of power that may be produced thereby,
does not depend upon the size of the re-
actor as determined by nuclear consid-
erations. Any amount of power from a
few watts up to hundreds of thousands of
KW may be produced from any size
reactor provided this energy can be re-
moved from it. In the smaller reactors,
it is interesting to note that the limitation
on the power production is not a nuclear
one, but rather one that is dictated by the
mechanical—the thermodynamic ability of
the engineer to remove the desired amount
of heat from the small volume of the re-
actor required by the nuclear physical
consideration.
As was mentioned at the very begin-
ning of this article, the application of the
heat released in the reactor to the produc-
tion of useful power, and as the electrical
energy, or by the rotation of a propeller
shaft, is in general achieved through con-
ventional thermo-dynamic cycles. This
does not, however, mean that this part of
the system is necessarily identical with a
similar cycle used for conventional chemi-
cal cycles. Indeed, the reverse is almost
always true because when using conven-
tional fuels, the engineer is given a tem-
terature level of approximately 3000° F.
with which to start from the combustion
gases. The materials with which he makes
the boiler tube or gas turbine blades can
be considerably cooler than these combus-
tion gases by proper design. In a nuclear
reactor almost the opposite is true, the
materials in the core of the reactor proper
must be the hottest in the entire system,
and these are the very materials which
have the most severe requirements already
imposed on them as regards neutron ab-
sorption, radiation damage, strength, and
corrosion. Furthermore, at least in the
case of the mobile power plants, where
cost factors are not usually controlling,
one of the really big incentives to go to
a higher temperature, and therefore a
more efficient, power plant is lacking. The
weight of the nuclear fuel itself is an al-
most inconsequential part of the total
weight of a nuclear power plant, so that
improvement in efficiency does not mean
that the ship or plane can have increased
cruising range as it does in the case of
conventional fuels. These two factors add
up to the fact that "conventional" power
plant end of a nuclear power plant usual-
ly operates at the lowest temperature that
it is possible to get by with.
Many of the instruments and control
servo-mechanisms used in a nuclear power
plant are similar to those used in ordinary
power plants; however, the aspects of
leak tightness, reliability, and inaccessi-
bility of maintenance, give rise for more
exacting requirements in the case of these
instruments and power control devices.
Instruments which detect radiation, pres-
sure, temperature, fluid flow, and liquid
level, all must operate in the presence of
very great radioactivity, and at high tem-
peratures, reliably and often without
maintenance or adjustment. Furthermore,
the range which must be covered be-
tween the variable to be measured and the
power to be applied to a control mechan-

Men, [J chemistry, and coal!
Science has found a new way to get valuable chemicals from coal
Science has at last found a practical way to convert coal into
the host of valuable chemicals that nature locked into it.
The people of Union Carbide have developed a way to
bring coal and hydrogen gas together under carefully con-
trolled heat and pressure. In minutes, this revolutionary
process—called coal hydro genation—converts the coal into
a mixture of gases and liquids that are rich in useful
chemicals.
A WEALTH OF RAW MATERIALS-Among them are hith-
erto scarce, and even completely new, chemicals. Some are
raw materials for plastics and synthetic rubber, or are vital
to medicine and vitamins. Some are valuable in rocket pro-
pulsion. Others are necessary in insecticides, surface coat-
ings, and many other important uses.
A NEW SOURCE OF SUPPLY-Today, Union Carbide's
coal-hydrogenation process promises steady and vastly in-
creased production of chemicals for these needed materials.
What's more, it will provide a host of chemicals that may
become the basis of many new products.
A UCC ACHIEVEMENT-With the first coal-to-chemicals
plant of its kind in operation, the people of Union Carbide
are now well on the way to making abundant coal a source
of chemicals important to us all.

Leonardo Da Vinci—Self-portrait
earth on falling bodies almost one-hun-
dred years before the rotation of the
earth was conceived to be a reality. He at-
tributed this effect to the rotation of the
heavens around the earth in true Ptole-
maic fashion. He also studied the impact
between bodies—both direct impact and
oblique impact. His discussion of these
things were verbal, augmented by arith-
metical quantitative calculations. He can-
not be said to have used the symbolic
equations which characterize all modern
theoretical work. But such equations were
still waiting to be invented by Des Cartes
some hundred and fifty years later.
His most sustained scientific study arose
in his endeavors to invent the airplane.
His notes contain a complete treatise on
the flight of birds. He considered the bird
as a machine working according to mathe-
matical law. He considered also that man
could imitate it—not perfectly—but suc-
cessfully. Power was to come from man
himself as it came from the bird itself. He
proposed the study of the motion of air
to be carried out analogously in a mov-
ing fluid, water—which could be seen.
He studied very closely the motions of
the wings of birds and, unfortunately
for him, he was more impressed by the
flapping of the wings than he was with
the gliding on wings. Even a genius can
be impressed by the wrong thing.
Although none of the details in the
education of an engineer today comes to
us through Leonardo da Vinci it is well
for us on this, the five hundredth anniver-
sary of his birth, to think back on this
precursor of our art who was born too
soon and who was cursed with too much
talent.
A first grade teacher fresh from college
was taking over class for the first time.
Upon entering the class she noticed a
nasty word on the blackboard. (Signed
only by the Phantom). She didn't know
what to think or do. So she said, "Now
children let's fold our little hands, put
them on our little desks, and put our
little heads down on the desk. Then the
person who wrote this word on the black-
board will come up and erase it." So they
all folded their little hands, put them on
their little desks, and put their little
heads down on the desk. All was quiet
for a short spell, then there was a thump,
thump, thump of little feet, a pause, and
a thump, thump, thump, of little feet
going back to the desk. After everything
was quiet again the teacher said, "Now
let's see if the word was thoroughly
erased." So they all looked to the board.
Much to their surprise they found written
there, a nastier word, and "the Phantom
strikes again."

Friend: "My good man, why don't you
take the train home?"
Drunk: "It's no use, my wife wouldn't
let me keep it in the house.
"What is a flood?" the teacher asked
as her pupils' brows formed ridges.
"I know" said Ray, the number one
boy. "It's a river too big for its bridges."

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Using an election tube developed by RCA, automotive engineers have
perfected an instrument which automatically controls automobile headlights.
Out of the stars - a cure for headlight glare!
When RCA scientists developed an
electron tube so sensitive that it could
respond to flickering starlight, astron-
omers promptly put it to work in their
studies of the Universe.
Called a multiplier phototube, RCA's
invention now "takes to the road" in an
instrument which will add to your safety
when driving at night. The multiplier
phototube is now being used in an auto-
matic control for automobile headlights.
Here's how it works. RCA's tube, in a new
system, sits behind your windshield where
it can "see" approaching headlights. A car
comes, and the multiplier phototube acti-
vates a system which shifts your headlights
to low beam—returns them to high when the
other car has passed. It's simple. It's com-
pletely automatic. And what's most impor-
tant, it lets you keep your undivided atten-
tion where it belongs... on driving your car.
Development of the multiplier phototube
is another example of how RCA research
benefits you. RCA research assures you finer
performance from any product or service of
RCA and RCA Victor.

There has been too much loose talk about prices,
wages, dividends, taxes. Let's see.
Compare 1939 (the last normal year before
the war) to 1951 (the last year for which there
are figures).
Prices have gone
up
86%
Weekly earnings of
production workers
up
172%
Dividends of corporations
up
148%
Federal Taxes
up
843%
By the use of more efficient machines, indus-
try has been able to increase wages twice as
much as prices have risen, and has increased divi-
dends to its millions of owners. If you don't
feel that much better off, put the blame where
it belongs ... on taxes. Authorities say 10
billion dollars could be cut out of those taxes
without affecting government safety or service
a particle.

the skilled publications engineer develops

In addition to the variety of writing
from the product standpoint, there is also
much variation in the material to be gath-
ered on any one product or system (Fig.
Another attractive feature of the pub-
lications engineer's work lies in the variety
of contacts which he makes in the course
of the development and approval of a
publication. A typical life story of an in-
struction book prepared for the Armed
Services (Fig. 4), gives an indication of
the many individuals concerned in the
preparation or approval of the publica-
tion prior to its final printing; the pub-
lications engineer works constantly with
all of those shown.
The Future for Publications Engineers
Young engineers often raise the ques-
tion as to the future of technical writing
or publications engineering. There are
several factors which appear to be of
importance in attempting to predict the
future—but to the author they all look
favorable toward increasing opportunity
for this new profession. First, the com-
plexity of equipment and systems cer-
tainly will increase—automatic control is
the ultimate goal of nearly all future in-
strumentation, and with such control al-
ways comes increased technical complex-
ity. With increasing complexity there is
greater need for more complete instruc-
tional material. As one associate put it:
"The equipment becomes more complex,
but the intelligence of the average user
remains the same." Second, granted that
complexity will increase, there is the im-
mediate following condition that the
equipment will be much more costly and
must be repaired rather than replaced.
This adds again to the need for publica-
tions which will be adequate for the pur-
pose. The funds allocated for publications
will necessarily increase but will still be a
very small portion of the total cost of the
equipment. Third, if the caliber of engi-
neering graduates coming into publica-
tions engineering is maintained or raised,
there will be a broadening in the scope
of their work since they themselves will
develop opportunities for using their
special skill to supplement the work of
other engineers. This is a very important
responsibility in any new profession—to
develop and broaden particular skills and
to offer them to others. If the publica-
tions engineer pursues his new profession
with a spirit of genuine service to other
engineers, there can be little doubt that
the engineering profession will welcome
and encourage this newcomer to its ranks.
Conclusion
Publications engineering is a new pro-
fession which has grown rapidly in the
past few years because of the increasing
complexity of equipment and the inability
of the research and development engi-
neer to undertake the extensive writing
projects which have become necessary.

for designs where light weight is important
Reducing weight without sacri-
ficing performance is one of the
major considerations in many
modern products. Designs are
streamlined to pare off excess
weight New and lighter materi-
als are being used. Components
which save even a few ounces
frequently contribute greatly to
product success.
Light Weight
Plus High Capacity
The unique design of the Tor-
rington Needle Bearing makes it
ideal for a wide variety of prod-
uct uses. It consists of two com-
ponents — a thin, hardened outer
shell and a full complement of
small diameter rollers. Its many
lines of contact give the Needle
Bearing a greater rated radial
load capacity than any other
type of anti-friction bearing for
its size and weight Conversely,
for a given load capacity, a
Needle Bearing is the lightest,
most compact bearing available.

Needle Bearings reduce weight and size while providing high radial load capacity.
Weight Savings
In Related Assemblies
In addition to the light weight of
the Needle Bearing, its design
permits sizable reductions in the
size and weight of the related
assemblies. Its small outside di-
ameter allows the use of smaller
housings. And, since a press fit
in a simple straight housing bore
is adequate to locate the bearing,
no complex shoulders or housing
modifications are required. The
hardened shaft usually serves as
the inner race, saving additional
space and weight
These advantages, plus its
high radial capacity, have made
the Torrington Needle Bearing
particularly attractive to the de-
signers of aircraft, portable
power tools, small gasoline en-
gines and many other products
where weight and space are im-
portant factors.

rington Needle Bearings will be

used up if the supply of oxygen was
sufficient.
Vegetal Theories:
Three generic types of vegetation can
be considered as sources of petroleum
hydrocarbons. These are kelp and sea-
weed, deatons, and the various land
plants which inhabit swampy regions and
other fresh-water bodies. If properly dis-
tilled, the kelp and seaweed which grow
in areas such as the Sargasso Sea could
easily account for oil reservoirs of the
size we find today. Diatomaceous shales
have led the geologists of the world to
investigate the possibility of deatoms as
a source of oil also, but the profitable
quantity of the hydrocarbon content is
questionable.
The last category of plants which may
have been utilized in the formation of
petroleum are those aquatic but non-
marine plants which have been altered
to coal. Geologists knowledge of the coal-
forming process would fill ten books with
description. Oil formation from land
plants would preserve by distillation some
of the very chemicals which the carboni-
fication process destroys. This would en-
tail release of the solid volatiles and re-
duction of the intermediary acids to the
liquid-volatile state.
Physical Processes in Organic Origin
Chemistry alone cannot be called upon
to explain the origin of petroleum; many
physical processes enter into the forma-
tion of the oil hydrocarbons. Due to the
extreme depth at which petroleum is
found, the temperature as calculated by
heat gradient methods must be from 40-
to 150°C. It is therefore possible that
heat distillation may take place where air
pressures have definitely been reduced to
allow local boiling. Hydrostatic pressures
have definitely affected formation by fa-
voring the chemical reaction which pro-
duces the smaller volume and hence the
greatest contained volatility.
CONCLUSION
One cursory glance at the advancements
in determination of the origin of petro-
leum shows the inadequacy of the study.
With a future of diminishing petroleum
reserves facing the United States, a great
deal may hinge on the development of
accurate information on the process of
formation of oil. The economy and trans-
portation of the nation depends on pe-
troleum; without it, almost every phase
of American life would be hindered or
destroyed. In order to produce hydro-
carbons synthetically, science must have
factual knowledge of the formation of
the hydrocarbons in nature. The ex-
ploitation of natural deposits of petro-
leum beyond the present endeavors also
depends on more knowledge of the origin
of oil. Aside from the research in atomic
power, which may someday replace petro-
leum, no problem should be more press-
ing to industry, science, and commerce
than this one, the exact determination of
the origin of petroleum. There are plenty
of theories, as herein contained; now
find the answer!

When the country's largest railroad
loudspeaker system was phnaed in the Baltimore
and Ohio's yards near Chicago, the choice of cable to be
used was a key factor. With 37 miles of underground
cable involved, subsequent maintenance costs could con-
ceivably be a major item if any but the best cable were
to be used.
Okonite cable was chosen for this job because of its
superior rubber insulation and the resistance of its
Okoprene sheath to alkalis, acids, oils and other corrosive
substances encountered in railroad yard installations, lb-

vice helps insure that air used in purifica-
tion processes has a very low moisture
content, which contributes to a spring-
water taste.
On one occasion, G-E engineers were
attempting to develop a "self-contained"
power source for a radiation monitor—a
device which permits radiation readings
at a glance.

provement over the physics experiment,
in that it measures various amounts of
color in a single reflected color.
Engineers say the instrument will meas-
ure more colors than there are grains of
sand in the universe. The spectrophoto-
meter was literally called to the colors
during World War II, when it was used
to help standardize the color of material
used for service uniforms, and the paint
a newly-coated fabric, or a different de-
sign on the original fabric.
Of course, G-E instrument engineers
agree, good mechanical design and engi-
neering know-how play a big part in de-
veloping efficient instruments. But don't
overlook the physics principles. Tailored
to specific needs, they're helping men
see, touch, smell and hear far beyond
human powers.
This old physics principle, creating static electricity by rub-
bing a glass rod with silk and then attracting bits of paper
to the rod, is being used commercially to electrocoat fabric.
Batteries were too bulky for the instru-
ment, and outside power source too im-
practical. Then one of the engineers re-
membered a familiar physics principle
of producing voltage by sliding mercury
down a glass tube. The results were "elec-
trifying."
By tipping the instrument, mercury
slides down a glass tube to produce about
400 volts and charge an electrostatic volt-
meter. When the instrument is turned
upright, gravity-operated switches discon-
nect the mercury generator and leave the
voltmeter charged. If radiation occurs,
the voltage will decrease and register on
the voltmeter, indicating presence of ra-
diation.
Remember the one about passing beams
of sunlight through a prism for dispersion
into various colored rays? Another peek
into a physics book and out came an idea
for a device known as a spectrophoto-
meter. The instrument, however, is an im-
on military ecjuipment. Since then it has
been used to match color of false teeth;
to standardize the color of railroad and
traffic signal lights; to match milady's
lipstick; and a myriad of other uses.
And if you've ever run a comb through
your hair and then used the comb to at-
tract bits of paper, you'll recognize the
principle of static electricity. It's the
same shocking effect produced by rubbing
cat's fur.
With the aid of G-E electrical equip-
ment, a manufacturer began using the
principle a few years ago to make coated
abrasives or sandpapers. The same prin-
ciple gave rise to a new business—that
of electrocoating fabrics.
This technique, or the comb and paper
trick "grown up," is a process whereby
cloth fibers sent through an electrostatic
field become charged, stand on end, and
are hurled perpendicularly against an ad-
hesive-coated fabric. The result is either
Attractive powers of static electricity were used to upholster
the turntable on this record player.
An instrument that "smells" is the mer-
cury vapor detector, a device used to de-
tect presence of harmful mercury in areas
where fumes might injure the health of
workers. Although the instrument doesn't
"smell" in the same manner as humans,
it is particularly sensitive to mercury and
will do a better detecting job than any
human smeller.
In this device, G-E engineers used a
principle similar to that which makes
litmus papers turn red when exposed to
excess acids and blue from excess alkalies.
They did this with yellow selenium sul-
fide, a material which reacts with mercury
to form black mercuric sulfide.
Air from the area under examination
is drawn into the instrument and blown
across a selenium sulfide coated paper.
If mercury vapor is present, amounts of
discoloration on the paper can be quickly
observed.

THE WORLD'S FIRST fluid hydroformer went into operation
in November at Destrehan, Louisiana — an important
event in the history of civilian and military fuels. It
produces high-octane aviation gasoline blending stock.
A Marriage of Engineering Techniques
Engineering ingenuity has been, and will
be, a key to American industrial progress.
In the petroleum industry, a specially shining
example of such ingenuity is the recent mar-
riage of two already successful techniques.
Issue of this union is a rewarding off-spring
—the fluid hydroforming process.
Fluid hydroforming's genealogy stems from
two processes with long-established success
in refinery use:
FLUID CATALYSIS —First applied to
catalytic cracking. The uniform bed tem-
perature inherent in the fluidized-solids
technique permits selection of just the
right reaction conditions.
HYDROFORMING—Used to upgrade
virgin naphtha by converting naphthenes
and other low-octane materials into high-
octane aroma tics. Has always employed
catalyst in fixed beds.
It wasn't easy to combine these two proc-
esses, with their widely different histories. But
eventually petroleum chemists and engineers
perfected fluid hydroforming, a new process
with the advantages of both its ancestors. It
produces large yields of high-octane gasoline.
Since Standard Oil helped pioneer the two
parent techniques, it is fitting that a company
subsidiary, the Pan-Am Southern Corpora-
tion, should be the first to put the combined
method to commercial use.
Fluid hydroforming is another example of
the many opportunities for the company's re-
search and development staff to apply their
technical training—and to gain a sense of real
accomplishment from their work.

I yield to pressure.
It has sort of been policy in the past
to print these teasers without furnishing
solutions except upon request. But . . .
In the November issue we published a
teaser that seems to have caused a little
consternation among some of our read-
ers. It was the problem about the king at-
tempting to find the wisest man in his
kingdom. Here's a brief statement of the
problem: The king tells his three wise
men, "I will blindfold you and paint
either a red or a black spot on your fore-
heads. Then I will remove the blindfolds.
You will raise your hand if you see a red
spot and lower your hands when you
have figured out what your own color is."
The king painted red on all their fore-
heads and released the blindfolds. All
raised their hands then finally one man
lowered his hand and said, "I know be-
cause no one else knows," How did he
ascertain his color?
Let us first label the wise men 1, 2,
and 3, with number one being the man
who finally solves the puzzle. Number
one proceeds to reason as follows: I will
assume that I have black. Assuming this
I put myself in the place of the man on
my right. (2) The man on my right
must see my black and the red on the
forehead of the man on my left. (3)
And, likewise, the man on my left must
see my black and the red on the forehead
of the man on my right. Now, if this was
so, then either the man on my right or
the man on my left would lower his hand
because he would know which color he
had. (Because all hands were raised, all
of the men could see a red mark.) But,
number one continues to reason, neither
of these other fellows lowers his hand
and therefore, my original assumption
must be wrong. I do not have black; I
have red. Simple, isn't it?
* * *
Now, let's move on to this month's
teasers.
Next Sunday morning when your mind
starts wandering along toward the mid-
dle of the preacher's sermon, try con-
templating this cute little problem.
A hymnboard in a church has four
grooved rows on which the numbers of
four hymns chosen for the service are
placed. The hymnbook in use contains
700 hymns. What is the smallest number
of plates, each carrying one digit, which
must be kept in stock so that the numbers
of any four different hymns selected can
be displayed; and how will the result be
affected if an inverted six can be used
for a nine?

Care to learn a new game? One at
which you can't possibly lose (more than
half the time)? Then listen and learn.
Take twelve buttons (or coins, wash-
ers, etc.) and arrange them in three rows,
thusly:
XXX
X X X X
X X X X X
Then you and your opponent take turns
removing buttons from the rows, the ob-
ject being to leave your opponent with
the last button.
You may take as many buttons each
time as you wish with the restriction
that you may not take buttons from two
rows at the same play. Now, on the sur-
face this appears to be a simple, straight-
forward game. But ... if the first per-
son playing takes the right number of
buttons from the right row, his opponent
cannot possibly win. (Assuming correct
play by both parties.) What is this un-
beatable first move? Answer next month.

In a certain town lying on the border
between Mexico and the United States a
peculiar currency situation exists. In
Mexico a U.S. dollar is worth only ninety
cents of their money, while in the United
States the value of the Mexican dollar is
only ninety cents of our money. One
day a cowhand strolls into a Mexican
cantina and orders a ten-cent beer. He
pays for it with a Mexican dollar, receiv-
ing for change an American dollar, worth
just ninety cents there. After drinking his
beer, he strolls over the border to an
American saloon and orders another. This
he pays for with an American dollar re-
ceiving a Mexican bill for change. He
takes this back across the border and
repeats the process, drinking beer merrily
all day, and ends up as rich as he started,
with a dollar.
The question: Who paid for the beer?
The moral: Visit sunny Mexico on your
vacation.

Poaching on the hunting preserves of
a powerful prince was punishable by
death, but the prince further decreed that
anyone caught poaching was to be given
the privilege of deciding whether he
should be hanged or beheaded. One logi-
cal rogue availed himself of this dubious
perogative—to be hanged if he didn't and
to be beheaded if he did—by making a
statement which allowed him to go scott
free. What was the statement?
Recently we printed a teaser of the
type below, and being sort of fascinated
by it, we were happy to run across a simi-
lar problem the other day. This similar
problem runs thusly:
A train is operated by three men,
Adams, Green, and White, who are engi-
neer, fireman, and brakeman, but not re-
spectively. On the train are three passen-
gers, Mr. Adams, Mr. Green, and Mr.
White.
1. Mr. Green lives in Detroit.
2. The brakeman lives halfway be-
tween Chicago and Detroit.
3. Mr. Adams earns exactly 2000 dol-
lars per year.
4. Mr. White beat the fireman at bil-
liards.
5. The brakeman's nearest neighbor,
one of the passengers, earns exactly three
times as much yearly as the brakeman.
6. The passenger whose name is the
same as the brakeman's lives in Chicago.
Now, who is the engineer?
To the first person submitting the cor-
rect answer to this problem (and his
method of solution) the Technic will
award a 10 cent Hershey bar with al-
monds.

• Robert F. Karcher, a 1951 Mechanical Engi-
neering graduate from Purdue University, is
another Allison engineer who is pioneering in
an advanced field of mechanics. He is playing
an important role in the Research and Develop-
ment group of the Transmission Engineering
Section.
Allison is the world's largest manufacturer of
torqmatic drives for heavy-duty Ordnance and
commercial vehicles and equipment. These
transmissions serve a purpose far broader than
a unit in the power train. All the steering and
braking of the vehicle also are accomplished in
the transmission. These operations are con-
trolled by hydraulic circuits which consist of
clutches, pumps, governors and necessary valv-
ing to make them operate in the proper se-
quence. The assembly of the valving system is
often termed the "brain box" of the transmis-
sion since it determines how the transmission
will operate to provide maximum performance
and maneuverability with finger-tip control.
Bob, shown above examining a CD-500
transmission, is involved in developing a new
improved system of governing automatic con-
trol systems of many Ordnance and commercial
transmissions. This involves basic analysis, de-
sign and testing of pilot samples. These hy-
draulic controls provide proper sequence for
clutch operation to determine speed range, con-
venor or lock-up operation. They also provide
steering control for the vehicle when this func-
tion is included in the transmission.
Bob and other Allison engineers are con-
tinually applying their knowledge, experience
and imagination to find successful answers in
the never-ending search for product improve-
ment. There is a real engineering challenge at

PUBLICATIONS ENGINEERING
(Continued from page 32)
The publications engineer must have a sound engineering
education and must possess writing aptitudes—although it is
pointed out that many young engineers possess this aptitude
and may not be conscious of it.
The publications engineer has a thorough knowledge of the
reproduction and printing processes, and can guide the publi-
cation through all of its various stages from rough draft to its
printed form.
The variety of work assignments and the personal contacts
appeal greatly to certain engineering graduates. Some of the
writing assignments cover theoretical aspects, while others are
along practical lines where the writer works closely with the
equipment in the factory or in the field.
The personal satisfaction factor is quite high for the pub-
lications engineer since his assignments are usually of short
duration, compared to those of the engineer, and he sees the
final results of his labors at more frequent intervals.
Finally, the future of this new addition to the engineer-
ing profession looks promising because of the trend toward
more complex equipment and the accompanying requirements
for more complete handbook and engineering report coverage.
The future will also depend upon the efforts which publi-
cations engineers make to find new areas of service to the
engineering profession.

when certain fluid materials jell is bring-

duction of paint components, varnishes,
synthetic resins and plastics.
According to Dr. Robert E. Burnett, a
chemist at the General Electric Company
Research Laboratory, Schenectady, N.Y.,
an instrument known as the G-E gel-time
meter initially was developed for labora-
tory staff use, but now is finding its way
into plants that make plastics, paints and

slowly rotates. When increased thicken-
ing of the material intensifies the pull on
the rod, a spring closes electrical contacts,
stopping a visible time meter, which regis-
ters the time down to one-tenth of a
second. This action also halts the ma-
chine's motor and signals the operator
who has been free to prepare additional
samples.
Under a given set of conditions, the in-
strument will register the gel-time charac-
teristics of a fluid undergoing these

varnishes. The data furnished by the
meter provides information about the
qualities of the final product while the
materials are in an intermediate state, or
a semi-solid condition.
The former laboratory methods for
checking the time required for chemical
reaction of materials that turn to gels
were less exact and far too time-consum-
ing. The new meter completes the entire
operation automatically.
Test substances are automatically main-
tained at a given temperature in the ap-
paratus while a motor-driven stirring rod
changes with variation of less than plus
or minus one per cent on successive tests.
This permits the resin manufacture to
cook his reaction mixtures to the desired
extent within closer tolerance, and by
determining gel-time at intervals during
the cooking of a batch of resin, the prog-
ress of reaction can be closely followed.
When a batch of material is finished,
a gel-time measurement on the product
will indicate its quality. The meter also
can be used to show whether aging or
contamination of the product has oc-
curred during storage, shipment, or use.
Shower Tester
How to check a shower without taking
one is accomplished by special shower
tester used in the General Electric Com-
pany's Research Laboratory.
Showers are installed at strategic points
in workrooms of the laboratory to douse
a scientist in case his clothes catch fire
or in the event of acid burn.
Although they rarely are used, showers
have to be in working order and are
checked periodically. Devised by Howard
H. Fawcett, laboratory safety engineer,
special tester permits water from shower
to be squirted into a large funnel, from
which it is carried into a can. A hose con-
ducts the water to a nearby sink.
Army To Seek Data on Weather
55 Miles Above the Earth
How hot or cold it is from 55 to 75
miles above the earth may be determined
by the Army Signal Corps through a new
method for gathering facts about the
weather, the Department of the Army
announced.
The new method employs an inflated
sphere released after an 80-mile ride into
space in an Aerobee rocket.
The sphere, which looks like a partial-
ly-deflated balloon, is carried in a wooden
cylinder just behind the nose cone of the
rocket. Near the peak of the rocket flight,
the four and a half foot nylon sphere,
especially developed for these tests, is re-
leased. Air from a pressurized cylinder
finishes blowing up the sphere and gives
it shape.
Inclosed in the nylon sphere is an elec-
tronic transmitter capable of sending con-
tinuous signals to a ground station where
the data is recorded. Temperatures in the
upper air atmosphere can be determined
by measuring the rate of fall of the
sphere. Neoprene impregnated, and one-
fiftieth of an inch thick, the sphere was
made by the Goodyear Tire and Rubber
Company of Akron, Ohio.
Meteorologists now believe that at
about 55 miles the weather starts warm-
ing up from its minus 28 degrees Fahren-
heit temperature to about 4000 degree
Fahrenheit at a height of 400 miles.
Instrumentation of rockets is part of
the Army Signal Corps research and de-
velopment program. Data obtained is ex-
pected to help in study of atmospheric
changes, long range communications, and
design of new operating equipment.

the stresses, temperatures, and corrosive attack developed
by new rocket fuels.
Molybdenum additions to many alloys are known to

ism, necessitates a power amplification
greater than those ordinarily met in engi-
neering practice.
After the fuel has been removed from
the reactor, usually only part of it has
been consumed, and it is necessary that
the fuel elements be chemically and
metallurgically processed to salvage the
unconsumed fuel and prepare it for reuse
in the reactor. After this the radioactive
fission products must be disposed of. In
the present state of development of nu-
clear reactors, the rate of generating fis-
sion products having very long-lived
radioactivity is such that the fission prod-
ucts may simply be stored in isolated
areas. However, if the time comes when
there is widespread use of nuclear power,
the disposal of these fission products will
be a very real and serious problem.
In all that has been said above, an at-
tempt has been made to point out that nu-
clear engineering problems, although dif-
ferent from the "run-of-the-mill" engi-
neering problems, are ones which are
capable of solution by straight forward at-
tack. If one outstanding requirement of
(Continued from page 24)
the devices in nuclear engineering designs
was to be characterized, it would be the
requirement for the utmost in reliability,
since the penalty for failure in any part of
the system is so much greater than it is
in the case of failure in a conventional
power plant.
In conclusion: The general nature of
some of the engineering problems which
confront engineers in the development
of useful nuclear power has been pointed
out. Most of these problems cannot be
discussed in more specific fashion be-
cause of security restrictions. There are
good solutions on hand for some of the
problems; for others, solutions are avail-
able which are not ideal, but which are
at least acceptable for the time being and
show promise of improvement.
The problems of nuclear engineering
are difficult and challenging. Any engi-
neer who wants to work in this field will
find plenty to do. If we are to make the
best possible progress in the development
of nuclear power, the effort of many engi-
neers and companies, in addition to those

It has been said many times that there
must be a very wide involvement of
American industry in nuclear develop-
ments if the whole enterprise is to suc-
ceed. From the experience of the last five
years, it is evident that this is the case,
and that industry in general is respond-
ing. We have, however, really just begun
to scratch the surface. It is interesting to
note that one of the largest engineering
schools in this country is now planning a
regular curriculum in nuclear engineer-
ing following the lead of several smaller
universities which had had such curricu-
lum for a year or two.
Nuclear engineering requires, to a
high degree, the kind of perfection which
is expressed in the following quotation
from A. B. Hendrix, Jr., General Electric
Company, Pittsfield, Mass., November
24, 1943; the thought contained therein
is recommended to every engineer, and
especially to any aspiring nuclear engi-
neer.
"Nature is a hard taskmaster, but kind-
est to those traveling in the same direc-
tion. In machine design she pardons no
mistakes, the thing must work through
hell and high water regardless of theories,
opinions, or fashion of the moment. It is
either perfect or junk.
In modern art, literature, music, archi-
tecture, politics, sociology, and medicine,
we see the temporary success of the pre-
tentious, the charlatan, and plain damn
fool, but not in engineering.
For this reason engineering is of high-
est disciplinary value, and there is nothing
in religion or out of it so fitted to in-
culcate honesty, sincerity, esthetics, and
common sense."
After the J-Hop last spring, one of
the boys inevitably ended up in court.
Judge: "Officer, what makes you think
this man is drunk?"
Officer: "Well, judge, I didn't bother
him when he staggered down the street
or when he fell flat on his face, but when
he put a nickel in the mailbox, looked up
at the clock on Burton Tower and said,
'My God, I've lost 14 pounds,' I brought
him in."

Students in the above Laboratory are examining movie films of operations taken in
manufacturing plants. These loop films are arranged in a "before and after" pattern: that
is, the first film examined shows the job as performed in the plant "before" the plant Indus-
trial Engineer had improved it by the application of the principles of motion study; the
"after" film shows the improved job in operation. Our film library now totals several hun-
dred jobs.
Groups of two to four students analyze the jobs represented by these films and deter-
mine wherein the method followed by the operator is faulty. These groups next examine
the improvements made by the plant and repeat the critical examination. Further exercises
are designed to explain and to apply synthetic motion time values to establish produc-
tion standards.
Approximately one-half of the laboratory time is devoted to the subject of Time Study.
The students use stop watches in studying factory operations. Proper allowances for vari-
ous delay factors are developed and the technique of tempo rating—to compensate for
varying speeds of the operator during the study—form an integral part of this phase of the
laboratory work.

A specter is haunting the United States—not so
much the specter of communism or socialism as the
specter of our own apathy. Americans, on the whole,
are so settled in their own comfortable ruts that the
idea of change is most distasteful. Apathy is their
way of resisting change. But the fact remains that no
country, no system of government can be static—
either they move forward in pace with change or they
drop behind.
The point to all this? Lay aside the slide rule and
the integral tables for a minute and think about your-
self. When did you last read a newspaper—not just
the comics, but the current news and editorials? Have
you taken every opportunity possible to meet your
fellow students from all over campus, including stu-
dents from other countries who can give you their
invaluable viewpoints on yourself and your country?
Have you taken the time to try to understand other
people better? Math and EM and thermo don't leave
you enough time for these things? Are you sure that
this isn't just an alibi for apathy?
Admittedly, engineers are at a disadvantage in
comparison with Lit students. Engineers have much
less time for courses like psyc, poli sci, and history—
courses which attempt to give the student a view of
himself and the world in general. It has been said,
however, by many men who have attained promin-
ence in their chosen professions that the major part
of education is extracurricular—that an awareness
and a firm grasp on every opportunity for experience
among his fellow men is man's most valuable educa-
tion. It might seem, then, that, while you could fit
some of these non-engineering courses into your
schedule or audit them or read a book on the subject,
experience outside of class can be even more valu-
able.
Engineers are notorious for their lack of participa-
tion in extracurricular activities. Besides the profes-
sional organizations and the honoraries, there are
few activities on our corner of campus which have
not failed because of your apathy. Burying yourself in
books may do wonders for the grade average, but it
does absolutely nothing for you as a person.
Engineers in the business world are a large seg-
ment of our population. They are men of influence
and position in our society. Not only must they know
their thermo and EM, but a fundamental knowledge
of people is also essential. Engineers do not spend
their lives in laboratories as research physicists do;
they assume dynamic roles, asociating with and di-
recting people. They cannot afford to be apathetic—
yet many of them are.
The problem must be solved early. You cannot
afford to wait until you are out in industry. The mo-
ment you leave the comfortable rut of college and
books, you will be working with people—and your
experience must be broad enough to allow you to do
this effectively. Every personal contact you make now
will make you that much more a potential success in
industry.
In addition to broad personal contacts, the engi-
neer must also have an awareness of local, national,
and international situations, inasmuch as these will
affect his job or his judgment as an executive. Much
of this awareness of current affairs must come
through reading newspapers or, for those who like
their news in capsule form, news magazines. The
newspaper has been aptly described as "the daily
textbook of all literate people." It is just as important
a textbook as those which you use in thermo and EM
—and you can fail the practical course in awareness
if you choose not to use it.
Engineers must be prepared to assume their roles,
not only in their chosen field but in society as a
whole. The preparation must be thorough—and
apathy cannot be allowed to hamper your future.

100% WELD STRENGTH—Tensile tests on T-Steel speci-
mens like these were made to determine the strength
of the welds. These welds develop the full strength of
the parent metal. Note that breaks occur outside the
heat-affected zone, showing that the heat of welding
has not harmed the strength of the material. No special
pre-heating or post-heating treatments are required
beyond those used with ordinary structural steels.
This remarkable steel, U-S-S Carilloy T-l, offers great
promise to those who need a super-strong steel that can
be welded, flame-cut or cold-formed.
Carilloy T-l is unique. It differs from all other very
strong steels in important respects: Its yield strength of over
90,000 psi is not lowered by welding or flame-cutting. In
these operations, no pre-heating or stress-relieving is re-
quired. As a result. Carilloy T-l can be readily field welded.
Usually, welded steels of such high strength level suffer
a loss of ductility at low temperatures unless elaborate pre-
cautions are taken in the welding operation. In striking con-
trast, notched bend weldability tests show that T-l steel
will remain ductile and tough down to the lowest atmos-
pheric temperatures. As a matter of fact, T-l steel, after
flame-cutting, has been bent to a full 90° angle at tempera-
tures as low as -100°F., without any sign of cracking.
Service tests show that Carilloy T-l is well suited for
extremely abusive service, and the fact that it can be field
welded should greatly lower the difficulties and cost of major
repairs. In applications in which tension is the principal
stress, thicknesses can often be reduced to one-third of those
required with ordinary structural steels.
Carilloy T-l steel is another result of United States
Steel's active research program which has enabled manufac-
turers to improve their production methods and make better
products, too. All over the country, trained U. S. Steel engi-
neers and metallurgists are constantly at work on problems
like this, finding better ways to make and use steel. United

The Importance of
Cable Engineering and Design
Cable engineering is concerned with the
design and use of wires and cables to
direct the flow of electrical energy from
its source to the point of utilization. It
is generally more economical to gener-
ate electric power in relatively large
blocks at strategically located power
plants and to transmit it over relatively
long distances than to generate in small
quantities where it is used.
There are, therefore, two general types
of wires and cables used in the electrical
industry:
(a) those used for power transmission,
usually at voltages above 22 kilovolts,
(b) those used for power distribution at
lower voltages.
Cables used for power transmission are
generally single conductors with no
insulation. They are supported on in-
sulators above ground at such separa-
tions or spacings that the air provides
the required insulation. For power
distribution, on the other hand, where
the space occupied by the power line
is important, insulated cables are used.
This discussion deals with the design
and use of insulated wires and cables
for power distribution systems.
Insulated distribution cables carry
power from the transformer stations
along the transmission lines to its point
of ultimate utilization. The voltages at
which power is distributed vary from
about 15 kilovolts to 115 volts used in
individual homes. The higher voltages
are used for the distribution of rela-
tively large amounts of power from the
transformer stations to substations
nearer the points of utilization, such as
industrial plants, where it is trans-
formed to low or utilization voltages,
either alternating or direct current.
Large quantities of electric power are
distributed in this way and the value
of the distribution equipment required
is great. The value of the insulated
conductors, including those for both
portable or stationary installations,
probably exceeds that of any other
single item used in power distribution.
The design and operation of insulated
conductors and distribution systems are
of great public and commercial im-
portance. The primary function of
insulated cable engineering and design
is to provide safe, adequate, reliable
and pleasant appearing distribution sys-
tems. Electric power is so extensively
used in modern life that interruptions
to it are serious. The failure of elec-
trical power in an industrial plant
throws people out of work and reduces
production.
The appearance or sightliness of cables
installed overhead in a community is
important and is attained chiefly by
installing such cables with a small and
uniform sag from pole to pole.
Watch for the appearance of the second advertisement in this scries
in a forthcoming issue. Reprints of this advertisement and subsequent
ones, relating to the uses of insulated wire and cable, will be sent on
request without obligation.

speak sharply to Nature
There's a lot of loose talk these days about
profits, attacking them as though they
were evil.
The very existence of the world depends
on profits; the improvement of the world
depends on big profits. A farmer plants one
potato and usually gets back 15. Even allow-
ing for all his costs, that's more than
1000% profit! He plants one pound of corn
and gets back 336 pounds—that's 33,600%
profit. These are big profits. Is that bad?
Should the farmer be scorned as anti-
social? Should his "excess" profit (whatever
that is) be taken away from him? Should he
be told that from now on he must limit his
"profit" to, say, 6%?
To legislate against profits is as silly as to
legislate against things growing.

Charles W. Beti, now a thirty year old
second lieutenant in the Army, served three
years as a staff sergeant during World War
II. After the war he entered Michigan State
Normal College but later transferred to the
University of Michigan's College of Engi-
neering to study mechanical engineering.
While studying at Michigan he tackled three
major jobs—studying, working as a real
estate agent in Ypiilanti, and raising a
family. He became a member of the
Mathematics Club, Triangles, and Stoics.
As a cadet in the Army ROTC, he rose ts
the ran1- of lieutenant colonel and gained
honor as a "distinguished military student."
He wrote the fo'lowing article as a ma-
terial specialty project for an ROTC course.
Four systems of fuel supply have been
used on motor vehicles. They are: (1)
gravity feed, (2) pressure feed, (3)
vacuum feed, and (4) fuel pump feed.
The first three systems named are no
longer used for the reasons described in
the body of this report. This article is
intended to be a source of general infor-
mation on fuel pumps, the various types
used, the principles embodied therein,
and characteristics of each.
The writer searched through the refer-
ence texts in the engineering library and
several Army Technical Manuals, as well
as S.A.E. reports, manuals and bulletins.
This report represents a compressed sur-
vey of data available. After reading the
text material concerning the categories of
fuel pumps and comparing information,
extraneous and repeated data was dis-
carded with the pertinent facts being re-
tained for this article and classified by
systems.
System I. Gravity Feed
The fuel tank is located in the vehicle
on a higher plane than the carburetor so
that the fuel supply is maintained in the
float chamber. The chief difficulty with
this system is that the head pressure is
reduced when an incline causes the car-
buretor level to rise close to that of the
fuel level in the tank. Also the filler
cap must be at the top on the cowling of
the car, therefore causing damage to the
paint when fuel is added. There was the
added danger of fire due to the location
so close to the fire-wall; then, too, body
styling demanded lower centers of
gravity.
System 2. Pressure Feed

common among American and English
auto manufacturers. It consisted of a her-
metically sealed unit placed low in the
car or under the seats. Pressure was ap-
plied to the surface of the fuel in the
tank by means of exhaust back pressure or
a small air pump driven off the engine,
thus forcing the fuel up to the carburetor.
It was usually a 5 psi working gage pres-
sure medium, and it was very common to
outfit a car using this system with a hand
pump accessible to the driver to insure
adequate pressure in cases where the pro-
vided pressure source sometimes failed.
When the exhaust pressure was used, a
spring loaded valve was operated by the 3
pound pressure and allowed to exert it-
self on the fuel air space. The filler cap is
necessarily air tight and a total pressure
of 1.5 tons was the approximate load
exerted in the tank of an ordinary auto.
The air pump is considered better than
the exhaust pressure type as it is more
positive and reliable.
System 3. Vacuum Feed
This system largely replaced the gravity
feed and pressure feed systems because
of reliability and lower cost of manufac-
ture. This system is still used on some
commercial vehicles, both gasoline and
diesel operated. The principle of this
system consists in utilizing the partial
vacuum which exists in the intake mani-
fold to reduce the pressure on the tank
outlet so that the atmospheric pressure
operates on the fuel thus forcing it up to
a reservoir from which it flows, due to
gravity, to the carburetor.
This system has four parts. (1) the
vacuum pipe from the intake, (2) the
air vent with direct connection to the
outer vessel and connection with the in-
ner vessel when the valve is lifted by
the inner vessel's float, (3) fuel intake
pipe from the main supply tank, and (4)
fuel feed to the carburetor.
The system operates as follows: First
the outer vessel empties and the inner
vessel fills by virtue of the partial vacuum
supplied by the intake manifold (1),
which is opened by the float operated
valve being open. Thus fuel is drawn
into the inner vessel. When the fuel
reaches a given level in the inner tank,
its weight operates a "drop" valve and

INTRODUCTION
One of the outgrowths of our modern
engineering achievements has been the
necessity for more and more mathemati-
cal solutions to problems. The mathe-
maticians have been able to solve, theoret-
ically at least, most of these problems,
but in many cases the computations
necessary to obtain an accurate solution
take many years, or even several life-
times, to complete. Fifty years ago,
mathematicians and engineers were
forced to spend a large part of their time
merely doing long division! Kepler, the
astronomer who formulated the theory
on the motions in the solar system, was
forced to spend twenty years doing the
mathematics necessary to varify his
theory. His other theories on the uni-
verse were "impossible" to demonstrate
at this time as the computations (which

theories have since been verified by use
of high speed computers.

complex problems accurately in only a
fraction of the time which was previously
necessary. In recent years, so many ad-
vances have been made in the design and
construction of computers, that they are
of interest to engineers not only as a
means of solving difficult problems, but

as a field of study in themselves. The
basic principles have been developed, and
now applied engineering is necessary to
make the machines even more useful and
economical.
FUNDAMENTAL TYPES
Modern computers are of two distinct
types: digital and analog; although a
machine may be built employing a com-
bination of these types. The digital com-
puter performs arithmetical operations
with the actual digits. The ancient Japan-
ese abacuss (or bead counter) is a simple
example of a digital computer: One op-
eration is performed at a time, and it is
necessary for a skilled operator to com-
bine the operations correctly to obtain
the answer. In an analog computer, some
physical quantity is used to represent
each number in the problem. These quan-
tities are then combined according to
known physical laws so that the desired
operations are performed. The most com-
mon example of an analog computer is
the slide rule; where numbers are repre-
sented by lengths on the rule according
to a logrithmic scale and the lengths are
added to affect multiplication of the num-
bers. Each of these types of computers
has its own characteristics and potentiali-
ties, and is best suited to certain kinds of
operations and problems.
DIGITAL COMPUTERS
Modern digital computers include
everything from the common adding ma-
chine to the highly complex electronic
machines such as ENIAC at the Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania, which is used on
ballistic computations for the armed
forces. Simple arithmetical calculators in-
dicate digits by positions on racks or
gears. Numbers can be added or sub-
tracted by merely advancing or retracting
positions along the gear face. Multiplica-
tion and division can be performed by a
series of additions or subtractions, such as
is done on the common desk calculators.
Purely mechanical machines have se-
vere limitations in speed, and require
constant attention from the operator. The
IBM machines incorporate several im-
provements over standard desk calcula-
tors and have other advantages for certain
types of work. Numbers are fed into the

IBM machines on cards punched to in-
dicate the various digits. The numbers are
read from the cards by electrical contac-
tors, and the arithmetical operations are
performed by relays, either magnetic or
electronic. By making various connec-
tions, these machines may be made to
work a great variety of arithmetical prob-
lems very rapidly. As an example, one
machine can find the square root of a ten
digit number to three decimal places at
the rate of one a second. Any desired de-
gree of accuracy could be obtained in
time, since the machine operates with the
actual digits. Results of calculations can
be automatically punched on cards, and
other machines are available for sorting
and tabulating these cards at high speeds.
The IBM machines were originally de-
veloped for the Census Bureau, but they
have proved useful in many places where
much numerical data has to be processed.
Even the IBM machines seem slow
when compared to electron speeds. Mod-
ern high speed computers use electric
pulses to represent digits. For conven-
ience, numbers are usually expressed in
the binary system where only the digits 0
and 1 are used. Thus an electric pulse can
represent 1 and no pulse represents 0.
Arithmetic in the binary system is very
simple: 0-)-0=0
0+1=1
l-j-l=10

oxi=o
1X1=1

ed in this system:

BY
MARJORY J. MAURER, '54
Dotting the rocky hillsides of the
Keweenaw peninsula, from the mainland
to the tip, are the remains of a boom era
as fabulous as the boon eras in the old
West. Abandoned mine shafts surround-
ed by barbed wire, ruins of old mine
buildings, and hundreds of foundations
marking the places where cities of
miners' homes once stood bear testimony
to the history of Keweenaw copper. Pits
and excavations in solid rock, remains of
primitive copper utensils, and crude stone
mining tools give evidence of an earlier
mining venture by an unknown people
before the time of Columbus. These pits
and caches of native copper led to the
discovery of some of the vast Keweenaw
lode veins.
Since 1844, when the first mine shaft
at the Cliff mine was sunk, the copper
country has gone through periods of
boom and bust. The fate of the miners
rises and falls as the skip hoists rise and
fall in the shafts, for, aside from a small
amount of lumbering and much beauti-
ful scenery, the Keweenaw has only cop-
per. As a result of this almost 50,000
people made their homes on the peninsula
during the boom era late in the nin-
eteenth and early in the twentieth cen-
turies only to leave behind them small
settlements of miners and many ghost
towns when most of the mines were
abandoned during the depression.
The richness of the Keweenaw native
copper is due to the way in which it

mine buildings, has been allowed to

was formed. Hundreds of lava flows
formed a series of porous beds thousands
of feet thick. Hot solutions containing
copper from deep intruded magna fol-
lowed the pores and cracks in the rocks
upward, solidifying near the surface to
form pockets of native copper. The
presence of iron in the surrounding rock
explains why the copper is in its native
state, for iron combines with sulphur
and arsenic, the other elements that were
in solution with the copper, more readily
than copper does.
When the layers of copper filled igne-
ous rock, amygdaloid lode veins, had a
chance to weather before new layers
were extruded on top of them, the rock
broke up and was cemented together by
the copper into conglomerate lode veins
by the heat of the next extruded layer.
These conglomerate lodes became inter-
bedded in this way with the amygdaloid
lodes. Of the six main Keweenaw lodes
—the Calumet, the Baltic, the Isle Royale,
the Kearsarge, the Osceola, and the Pewa-
bic—only one, the Calumet, is a conglom-
erate. The amygdaloid lodes, however,
often have narrow adjoining conglomer-
ate lode veins. Subsequent tilting of these
beds left the veins sloping at about a
thirty degree angle.
The Keweenaw amygdaloids and con-
glomerates are both rich copper lodes, but
the problems of milling are very different
for the two types. In the amygdaloid
lodes the copper is found in the pores
and pockets of the rock and the problem
is to free the relatively pure copper from
the adhering rock. In the conglomerate
lode, however, the copper is the cement-
ing material which holds together rock
particles ranging in size from boulders to
fine sand. In milling the conglomerate
ores, methods had to be developed to
separate the copper from the rock par-
ticles which it interlaces. This is done by
crushing the ore and separating the rock
and copper by screening and gravity
washing, the latter based on the specific
gravity principle.
During the first years of mining the
Keweenaw lodes only the richest veins
were exploited. Because of crude methods
of extracting the copper from the ore,
the tailings, the wastes after extraction
of copper at the mill, dumped into Torch
Precautions taken at abandoned mines,
such as this one at Tamarack, include sur-
rounding covered shafts with barbed
wire. The shaft is in the foreground, old

ground.
Lake at the mill site still contained a
great deal of copper. Now, when copper
is in great demand, mines where the ore
was once considered too poor to take out
of the ground are being pumped and re-
opened. Pumping stations are being built,
pipe lines laid, mine buildings rebuilt,
and modern mining machinery installed.
Not only do modern milling operations
eliminate all but a minute amount of
copper in the tailings but tailings from
the early mining operations are being
dredged from Torch Lake by the Calu-
met and Hecla Company, the leading
mining company on the peninsula, and
reprocessed to reclaim as much as 14
pounds of copper per ton of tailings.
Current mining production yields an aver-
age of 20 pounds of copper per ton of
ore, although at one time (1874) the

yield averaged 96.8 pounds of copper
per ton of ore. The daily copper produc-
tion from reprocessing of tailings and
extraction from ore by C&amp;H is about
equal—approximately 144,000 pounds of
copper each.
An additional method of increasing
copper production, the reclamation of
copper-bearing scrap, is being accom-
plished through the ammonia leaching
process, a process perfected by C. H.
Benedict, at one time chief metallurgist
of C&amp;H. The reclamation yields almost
80,000 pounds of copper per day.
While some mines are being reopened
on the Keweenaw, depleted mines are
also still being abandoned. The Quincy
mines which produced copper for almost
one hundred years, for example, were
recently abandoned and the buildings left
to fall into ruin. Miners' homes once
owned by the mining companies have
been sold or torn down. Sewage systems,
schools, and fire fighting facilities in-
stalled and at one time maintained by
the companies have been turned over to
municipal governments.
The maintenance of the defunct mines
is a headache to a mining company such
as Calumet and Hecla on whose property
over fifty mine shafts, both operating and
abandoned, are sunk. Some of these
shafts may be reopened, but the rest of
the shafts must be kept securely covered
and fenced in with barbed wire. An addi-
tional problem arising is that of the me-
thane gas, generated by the rotting of old
timber mine shorings, which bubbles up
through the mine shafts. Flames or
sparks at the shaft entrances could cause
an explosion. The buildings at many of
these shafts have been partially or com-
pletely demolished; however, where they
remain, precautions must be taken to pre-
vent their being dangerous.
Because of necessity, through geologi-
cal and technical research, Keweenaw
copper is gaining importance once again.
New uses of copper compounds in agri-
culture and animal feeding are being in-

vestigated, and the old uses for metallic
copper demand greater and greater pro-
duction. The Keweenaw peninsula is be-
coming more prosperous and, if a new
lode were discovered, might even see
another boom era.
Lined Up for Defense
Tailcones for General Electric's famous
J-47 jet engines are lined up in the Com-
pany's receiving and inspection area here,
awaiting the call to become part of the
jet engines which power some of Amer-
ica's fastest fighters and bombers.
Like most of the components of the J-
47 engine built at Lockland, these tail-
cones were manufactured by subcontrac-
tors throughout the country under what
General Electric people call the "Lock-
land Plan."
This plan has been so perfected by
G. E. and its subcontractors that thous-
ands of parts for the J-47 engine funnel
into Lockland from over 4,000 suppliers
in 41 states and the District of Columbia.
Sixty cents of every dollar received by
G. E. from the Air Force for jet engines
is passed along to suppliers.
The J-47 engine powers many of the
Air Force's famous fighters and bombers,
including the North American F-86 Sabre-
jet, holder of the official world's speed
record of 670.981 mph, and the Boeing
B-47 Stratojet, capable of flying at speeds
over 600 mph.

OF LIFE
BY
Each year pledges to TAU BETA PI, the
natonal engineering honorary, are required
to write essays on cultural, literary, or phil-
osophical subjects. These essays are to dem-
onstrate the pledge's knowledge in the field
of humanities. This paper by a senior in
electrical engineering won first place in the
contest among this year's pledge class.
The phrase, a philosophy of life, repre-
sents one of those rather distant goals that
people are supposed to somehow attain as
they become mature adults. Often it is
something that develops in a rather ran-
dom manner as a result of many or few
experiences with reality. Just as the roots
of personality lie in childhood, the be-
ginnings on which a philosophy of life
develops are founded on the ways in
which the personality has learned to react
to situations and how it perceives them—
whether as conflict, right or wrong, pleas-
urable or distasteful, embarrassing or
amusing. Its development depends also on
what the person regards as his relation to
others in the world around him. If he is
to have a philosophy with lasting truth
and permanence, it must be integrated
with the final, the ultimate purpose and
meaning in and of life. I should not
want to be so pretentious as to assume
that I have, in the light of these determin-
ents, a fully crystalized or well-developed
philosophy. Rather, I would like to think
that I have developed the reasonableness,
insight, understanding, and hope on
which an optimistic and meaningful per-
sonal philosophy may be securely found-
ed. However, these determinants are only
the scene on the stage where the play of
life acts and reacts with attitudes in form-
ing the guiding ideas of one's life. It is
of these attitudes along which a personal
philosophy may be built that I would like
to tell.
The first attitude should be a passion
for truth and a willingness to accept it
for its own value regardless of how it
came to be discovered or by whom. The
character of truth lies in its performance
and stability. Thus a philosophy based
on it also has these attributes. But the ac-
ceptance of truth means more than this. It
should not be justified purely for the pur-
pose of establishing the basis for a per-
JOHN E. BACON, '53E
John E. Bacon
sonal philosophy. For the acceptance of
truth is the way in which progress by
society is made—and progress is a fun-
damental tenet of nearly all philosophies
and peoples. Thus the achievement of
understanding and the improvement of
worldwide living standards through the
years as the result of the discoveries of
new truths and their application should
be justification enough. In the sciences
there should be little apparent need for
external justification of truth, yet many of
us find ourselves unconsciously failing to
recognize truths or rejecting them when
they lie outside our own field of study.
While its importance is an ever constant
sort of thing, our acceptance of it is a
decidedly dynamic, progressive action that
must never cease.
A humble attitude regarding one's state
of learning and ability in all fields is what
I consider to be the second requisite for a
meaningful personal philosophy. Really,
individually, few of us know much about
our special fields of study. Even if we did,
how little and insignificant our knowl-
edge would be compared to all that is
ultimately to be known about any one
field—about all fields of inquiry. How
little is our wisdom in that which we
profess to know; how much less it is in
those matters and fields which we have
not studied. By being humble, I am not
suggesting that a person should have a
sort of inferior feeling, nor should he ever
cease trying to learn. I am saying that one
should keep in mind that the next person
he meets may know more about some-
thing or many things than he does; and
that the amount he knows about truth and
reality is almost nothing compared to the
sum of all that his friends and acquain-
tances know.
The last requisite for the development
of a philosophy is, I believe, not so much
an attitude as an allowance. It is an allow-
ance of time—time to think, time to
learn. One cannot hope to assimilate
enough experience, to learn enough of
reality, to produce a philosophy that is
wise during short years of college. Rather,
one might hope that he has established
some foundation upon which to build a
philosophy of life by the end of that
period. In the complexity and rush of the
society in which we live, we must not
be carried away; we must carry ourselves.
For in this way we can do the greatest
good for our fellowmen and for our-
selves. To do this we must allow ourselves
time to think; about what we are doing,
about what it means, based upon some
ultimate standard, about whether we are
truly serving our society and ourselves at
our best.
If we make our choices of alternatives
throughout life based upon what we
understand of ultimate truth, good, and
righteousness, and if, at the same time, we
try to find truth, be humble but not in-
ferior, and allow ourselves time to think,
we may attain our philosophy of life. We
may achieve peace of mind, and a sense
of having made some contribution. A
feeling that we have contributed some
portion of ourselves to the progress of the
world in which we live will be in itself
no insignificant reward for our effort.
A person who claims absolute zero is
impossible to obtain hasn't taken a quiz

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


BY
JESSE ORMONDROYD, Professor of Engineering Mechanics
In 1717 an infant of unknown par-
entage was deposited on the steps of the
church of Saint Jean-Ie-Rond in Paris.
For this reason he was known in his youth
merely as Jean le Rond. He was put in
the care of a poor family named Alem-
bert. Later on he assumed the name
D'Alembert. The aristocratic "D'" was
added as a slight bow in the direction of
his (officially) unknown parents who
were said by rumor to be members of
the current Parisian 400. His father,
judiciously avoiding scandal by remaining
anonymous, paid for his upbringing and
education and there is no record that
D'Alembert ever had to earn his living by
distasteful manual labor. At the age of
13, D'Alembert—or Jean le Rond as he
was then known—entered the College
Mazarin. He started to study Theology,
switched from that to the study of Law,
and from that to Medicine. But mathe-
matics was what he really liked and this
he studied as an extracurricular activity
under a tutor. He remained a scholar
with wide and varied interests until he
died in 1783—the same year that saw the
end of the American Revolution.
In the course of his lifetime he wrote
several books, among which were a trans-
lation of the Roman historian, Tacitus, a
history of the members of the French
Academy, a practical and theoretical treat-
ise on music, a book on the elements of
philosophy, and a radical treatise on re-
ligion. He definitely belonged to that
group of intellectuals in Paris who were
creating the atmosphere which led to the
French Revolution. This group dissemi-
nated its modernistic views through the
famous French Dictionnaire Encyclopedi-
que. This encyclopedia began to appear
at the rate of one volume per year in
1751. D'Alembert was, with Diderot, the
leading editor of this famous work which
partly owes its fame to the fact that it
was the first encyclopedia ever published
which included articles on the sciences
and technologies. The storm of protest
aroused in conservative circles by the ap-
pearance of the encyclopedia finally led
D'Alembert, who was a peaceful, studious
man, to resign as editor after the seventh
volume appeared in 1757. D'Alembert
was fortunate in dying six years before
the French Revolution began. He would
Jesse Ormondroyd
have applauded it in theory but would
have disliked intensely the rough and
gory details. He might even have ended
under the guillotine himself. Many of his
friends did.
Our chief interest in D'Alembert arises
from the fact that he was one of the
18th century mathematical physicists who
worked on astronomy and mechanics. He
worked on the famous astronomical prob-
lem of the motion of three bodies moving
in space under the action of gravitational
attractive forces. The great Newton him-
self could propose this problem sixty
years before without being able to solve
it. It still remains one of the famous
unsolved problems, although answers to
any degree of approximation can be
found. D'Alembert established Newton's
theory of the precession of the equinoxes
and Bradley's hypothesis of the muta-
tion of the poles on a sound mathemati-
cal basis. He was a pioneer in the prob-
lem of vibrating strings, helping, in this
work, to introduce partial differential
equations into mathematics and physics.
Engineers usually credit Froude with
the invention of testing models of ships
in specially equipped tanks, but D'Alem-
bert was many years ahead of Froude in
this game. Incidentally, our own Benja-
min Franklin preceded even D'Alembert
in model ship testing by a few years. In
1775, while the embattled farmers at Con-
cord were "firing the shot heard round
the world," D'Alembert and two other
technically minded gentlemen were mak-
ing the first extensive resistance tests on
model ships in a lake on the grounds of
the Ecole Militaire. The setup was quite
simple. The model was towed by a rope,
the force to overcome the resistance of
the moving model being supplied by a
falling weight attached to the other end
of the rope. The towing force being con-
stant, the model soon came to a terminal
velocity and the law relating this velocity
to the tow rope pull or resistance could
be determined. Many different shapes
with different length-width ratios were
tested in this manner. Even the effects of
the proximity of the bottom to the keel
and the effects of the sides and bottoms
of channels were tested by using false
bottoms made of wood just as in the
Towing Tank at the University of Michi-
gan. Interested engineers who can read
French will find all three early experi-
mental results described in a book entitled
Non velles Experiences sur la Resistance
des Fluides written by one of D'Alem-
bert's co-workers, Bossut, and published
in Paris in 1777.
In spite of all the works of D'Alembert
already mentioned, he would probably
have remained completely unknown to
posterity if he had not, at the tender age
of 26, published one of the famous land-
marks in the development of theoret-
ical mechanics, the Traile de la Dy-
namique, or Treatise on Dynamics. The
date of publication was 1743—just
210 years ago. The use of the word
"famous" in connection with D'Alem-
bert's treatise is somewhat inflation-
ary. Perhaps only a few hundred
individuals ever read the book in 1743,
and it is certain that less than a dozen
people in the whole world will look at it
in 1953. But it is mentioned in all the
histories of science and it did have an
important part in translating Newton's
mechanics into the mechanics that we
use today. The importance of the book
in 1743 lay in the fact that it said out
loud a great many things which Newton
had left unsaid in his great Principia
which was published in 1687. Newton's
book was not primarily a treatise on me-
chanics—it was a study of the motions of
the bodies in the solar system. The laws

RETURNS
In recent years, economists and states-
men have been greatly concerned with the
losing battle that two thirds of the world's
population is waging to maintain the
necessary level of food production. While
food production has increased arithme-
tically, population has increased almost
geometrically. This is cause for alarm and
there is serious need to investigate the
causes and try to find a feasible solution.
The areas hardest hit as regards food
production are, ironically enough, the
sites of what were once the most fertile
valleys, the bread baskets of the world—
the Nile, Tigris-Euphrates, and the
Yangtze valleys. Today the inhabitants
of those valleys are barely able to eke
out a livelihood. It is maddening and
frustrating to the fahleen in Egypt or
Iraq, and to the coolie in China, to race
the sun from dawn to dusk, tilling the
land, only to find that all around him
more people have come into this world,
not to increase, but to cut into the fruits
of his labor. And to crown his misery,
there is the periodic destructive flood.
This situation was brought about
through soil exhaustion caused by im-
proper soil management. Centuries ago,
the inhabitants in these valleys were
prosperous. But because of drought, fam-
ines, wars, or illness, many farmers had
to mortgage their farms at exhorbitant in-
terest rates, and later lost them by default.
The chapter on Joseph in Genesis de-
scribes how the Egyptians gave their
lands and stock to Pharaoh in return for
grain, and were eventually reduced to
serfdom. Through all these ages, the
majority of these people have worked
either as serfs or under the massive bur-
den of high taxes and high interest rates.
Thus did the vast dispossession of the
land bring about its decline through ab-
sentee ownership and indifferent hus-
bandry on the part of the tenant farmers.
In addition to this social-political fac-
tor there is an important physical one.
The farmers in these valleys depended
on yearly flooding for irrigating their
fields. These floodings, uncontrolled,
carry with them the filth and debris that

the rivers have accumulated and deposit
them on the farms. The dreaded disease
of Schistosomiasis is prevalent in these
areas, as the schistosoma find favorable
breeding grounds in irrigation canals and
rice fields. It is estimated that 50% of
the Egyptian population along the Nile
suffer from that disease. The schistosoma
enter the body, and their eggs, deposited
in the tissue of the body, produce abscess-
ing and tissue destruction. Suffering
chronically, the inhabitants cannot attain
a level of health that will permit a satis-
factory output of production.
Equally prevalent and devastating is the
dreaded malaria, which incapacitates mil-
lions in Asia, and kills thousands. In In-
dia it strikes villages annually and is
taken in its stride like a common cold.
But it is the chief sapper of health and
the destroyer of the strength needed to
earn a livelihood.
Thus, chronically ill, burdened with
taxes and interest, or entirely dispossed
from the land, millions of people live in
an atmosphere of lassitude and lethargy.
They are ignorant of the simplest ele-
ments of hygiene and sanitation. They
are politically and socially demoralized
and hopeless of finding even the begin-
nings of their salvation.
This is the problem that has become
the greatest challenge to the world today,
and the world, through the United Na-
tions World Health Organization, has
recognized engineering as the profession
best able to solve the problem and de-
velop an answer.
For the last few years, the WHO has
recruited promising young sanitary and
hydraulic engineers from every member
nation, and sent them to this country to
acquire the latest knowledge and tech-
niques in these fields. After this train-
ing period, these engineers return to their
native lands to form the nucleus of the
native force in the vital work of raising
the health and living standards.
An engineering analysis of the factors
involved indicates that the future salva-
tion lies in an intensive development of
the natural resources of the aforemen-
tioned stricken countries. For example,
a multi-purpose water storage project on
the Nile would accomplish the following.
1. Hydroelectric power for pumping
water for irrigation, rural electrification,
and industrialization.
2. A series of dams along the Nile for
flood control, reservoir basins, and sec-
ondary power development.
3. Inland reservoirs to store water di-
verted from the Nile, to be used for dry-
season demand and for widening the fer-
tile strip on either side of the Nile.
Simultaneously the sanitary engineer
has to clean out the schistosome through
control points at pumping stations, and
by a widespread building program of
sanitary facilities.
Land management will have to be dras-
tically revised. The one crop, cotton,
will have to give way to multiple crop
agriculture to insure a minimum margin
of security against crop failure. Water
will have to be controlled through irriga-
tion and applied intermittently when and
where it is wanted. Credits and taxes
will need to be tailored to the ability of
the farmers to absorb them without de-
stroying their agricultural progress. Final-
ly, it will be necessary to institute a long
range educational program on sanitation
and hygiene, soil conservation, and mech-
anized agriculture.
In the Tigris-Euphrates valley, old ter-
races can be restored and primary treated
sewage can be utilized for irrigating the
arid wastes in Iraq and the neighboring
countries. Multiple purpose dams could
develop enough power to service the
whole Arabian peninsula. Here again,
land management plays an important part.
A similar approach can be made to the
problems of the Yangtze Valley, to South-
east Asia, India, the Amazon valley, and
the continent of Africa.
Many authorities will point to India
as an example of a country that has bene-
fited from an intensive program of irri-
gation and dam building for the last sixty
years, but which finds itself today in more
serious straits than ever before. Here is a

Quiet Power Centers at M.I.T.
The dry-type transformers in these
power centers at Massachusetts Institute
of Technology were specially designed by
Westinghouse to operate quietly. By
using more iron in the cores, and thus
reducing the flux density, the sound level
of the 1000-kva unit on the right was
reduced to 60 decibels. The 200-kva
power center on the left also had its
sound level reduced to about 60 db. The
units are rated 13.8 and 2.4 kv respec-
tively, 3-phase, 60 cycle.

The new gas turbines will operate cen-
trifugal pumps to obtain this increase in
capacity. The El Paso system is now using
stations with reciprocating pumps at about
100-mile intervals along the line. The use
of these units will continue.
The gas turbine stations are being in-
serted at about 30-mile intervals between
existing reciprocating stations to boost
the average pressure and the flow of gas.
The operating cost of the new stations
is expected to be less than the cost of
present reciprocating stations, principally

is now being used successfully to pump
natural gas through pipelines.

power General Electric gas turbines for
the El Paso gas transmission system be-
tween West Texas and California has

because the new stations will require less
manpower for operation and maintenance.
Sites of the new stations are in the
desert where water is a precious com-
modity. Gas turbines are well-suited to
such locations because they require little
water and few operating personnel.
The gas turbines are being installed as
part of the expansion program of the El
Paso Natural Gas Company.
Nine of the units are already being in-
stalled and some are already in operation.
All the gas turbines are expected to be in
operation before the end of 1953.

A couple of people have asked me late-
ly about these long division problems
we've been printing every so often—the
problem with the letters stuck in in place
of numbers. These people (all freshmen
as a matter of fact) seemed to think these
problems unduly difficult if not impos-
sible. So I've taken a sample problem
and worked it out and this is just an ex-
planation for those who don't understand.
If you can work the problem by yourself
go ahead and check my reasoning. Okay?
Here we go.
The problem:
AEE
EABF/CJJBHA
"EABF
KCFDH
KEFCJ
KGGHA
KEFCJ
HKFA
The first thing to notice about this is
that the first line under the dividend is
identical with the divisor. Therefore,
A equals 1. So far so good.
Next, a close inspection discloses two
peculiar subtractions: H—J=H, and A —
J=A. These occur as part of the second
and third subtractions, respectively. J
equals O, obviously. (Care must be taken
in removing these subtractions from the
whole, since a digit may "borrow" from
its neighbor on the left and "lend" to
its neighbor on the right. This, fortun-
ately, doesn't interfere with this ex-
ample.)
The second subtraction looks like this:
KCFDH
KEFCJ
KGGH
You will notice the two F's in a verti-
cal row and the G beneath them. Now if
the upper F had not been borrowed from
there would be a J beneath the two in-
stead of a G (We proved that J=0).
Since there is a G it must be equal to 9-
Next, look at the dividend and no-
tice the two zeros (J's). Notice the
J with the A below (A=l). Now by
the same reasoning as we used before: if
the J had not been borrowed from there-
would be a G instead of a C beneath the
Edited by CHUCK STICKELS
A. (10—1=9) But, C is there and the
only thing C can be equal to is 8.
Look once again at the second subtrac-
tion and at the F that we reasoned must
have been borrowed from. Since the D
to the F's right must have done the bor-
rowing we can set up the equation 10—|—
D—C=G. C and G are known, there-
fore E&gt;=7.
The easiest way I found to do the rest
was to set up equations as above. So . . .
let's operate on the third subtraction.
KGGHA
KEFCJ
HKFA
Consider the top line. The K cannot
have anything borrowed from it. G is
equal to 9 and does not need to borrow
from anything. H is less than C (G=9,
C=8) and so must borrow from the
digit on its left. A has zero for a sub-
trahend. Being careful to observe all
these things it's possible to set up the
following equations.
10 H-C=F
G-1-F=K
G-E=H
Then, from the first subtraction C—
1 — E=K is obtained. When known
quantities are plugged in this business we
have four equations in four unknowns.
Elementary algebra gives F=6, H=4,
E=5, K=2.
The last unknown comes easily, B=3.
It's plain to see that the algebra and
the reasoning involved in these problems
is perfectly simple and straight-forward.
The only difficulty comes in setting up
these equations and initiating the rea-
soning.

Three shipwrecked sailors found them-
selves on an island where the only food
was coconuts. They gathered a large
number of coconuts and decided to get
some sleep before they divided the pile
into three equal shares. During the night
one of the sailors awakened and, not
trusting his companions, decided to take
his share of the collection without wait-
ing until morning. He found that after
throwing away one of the coconuts he
could divide those remaining into three
equal shares. He buried his share, left
the rest in a pile and went back to sleep.
Later one of the other sailors awakened
and proceeded to go through the same
routine; he threw away one coconut, took
one third and buried them, then went
back to sleep. Still later the third sailor,
no less suspicious than his mates, went
through the same procedure.
What is the least number of coconuts
the sailors must have collected originally
so that there would be a whole number
of coconuts left after this?
It seems that a farmer said to his hired
hand one day, "This bag of feed will
last our flock of chickens for 15 days,
but if we had 21 more chickens, and fed
each chicken 2/3 as much as we are
feeding them now, it would last only 12
days." How many chickens does the
farmer have?
Here's one that I thought was pretty
tough. I showed it to a friend, though,
and he gave me the answer back in just
about two minutes. I don't know how.
Try your luck.
In your physics lab you are given
eight similar balls, all of them identical
in appearance, but one slightly heavier
than the rest. You are also given a beam
balance with no weights, and asked to
determine which ball is the heavy one.
There is a condition which you must ob-
serve, though—you must make only two
weighings on the balance.

In the January issue we told about a
game played with three rows of buttons.
(Dig out the old issue and take a look
at it.) The purpose of the game, you
will remember, was to take buttons from
different rows in such a way that you
leave your opponent with the last but-
ton, and you will recall that there is an
unbeatable first move to this game, and
you will also recall that we promised to
publish this unbeatable move in this
issue.
Without further ado, the answer: Take
two buttons from the top row. A friend
of mine at MIT claims he knows a guy
who built a machine that will play this
game. Interesting, what?

allows the fuel to flow into the lower
chamber. At the same time the at-
mospheric valve (2) is opened and
the suction valve (1) is closed.
As the fuel flows into the lower vessel
the float again drops, opening the suction
valve and closing the atmospheric valve.
This cyclic operation is repeated as often
as the carburetor uses the fuel in the
lower vessel. The chief difficulty of this
system is that at low engine speeds there
is insufficient vacuum to provide pressure
enough to fill the inner vessel, thus result-
ing in starved carburetion.
System 4. Fuel Feed Pump
The fuel feed pump systems are fool
proof, compact, and operate independent-
ly of intake manifold pressure and thus
today have replaced the first three sys-
tems described by 98%. This pump sys-
tem provides fuel proportional to the en-
gine speed and in excess of it so as to
insure positive operation always. These
pumps usually draw the fuel through a
gauze-type filter and deliver it to the
carburetor float chambers, excess pressure
causing a ball check valve to open per-
mitting the fuel to recirculate. Most of
these pumps operate at 2 psi and are either
mechanically or electrically driven. The
majority of mechanical pumps are driven
by the cam shaft, while the electrical
pumps employ a solenoid magnet ener-
ganized from the battery and provided
with a make and break contact so as to ob-
tain an intermittent movement for the pis-
ton or diaphragm, giving pumping action.
Before entering into the description of
various types of pumps, it might be well
to discuss factors which determine the lo-
cation of them on the engine. Prime con-
sideration should be given to the possible
location as to accessability of the prime
power source. Then, caution should be
taken not to locate near hot areas, such as
exhaust manifolds or piping, or vapor
locking may result. It is best to place the
pump at a lower level than the carburetor
so as to eliminate any possible surging
effect and insure uniform feed. Also con-
sidered must be the accessability to filter,
hand primer, and maintenance.
The A. C. Fuel Pump. This type was
the first mechanical fuel pump to appear
on the market. It has been greatly im-
proved but still operates on the original
flexible diaphragm principle. The pump
is operated by the camshaft which raises a
The Tecalemit Fuel Pump
The engine eccentric A running at one-
half engine speed causes the lever B to
oscillate about pivot C and depress col-
lar D on spindle E and pull the dia-
phragm F downward against the action
of spring G. This produces a vacuum
on the upper face of the diaphragm
causing fuel to enter chamber H by
mean of Union I and passage Q from
where it passes down through the filter
gauze R and inlet valve J to chamber K.
As the eccentric rotates, the lever B
will tilt assisted by spring O allowing
the collar D, spindle E and diaphragm
F to rise by virtue of spring G so as to
pump the fuel in chamber K past the
outlet valve L to the carburetor or in-
jector pump, as the case may be.
lever arm that connects to the diaphragm,
thus causing an oscillating motion. If the
pump chamber is full of fuel the dia-
phragm remains depressed, permitting the
rocker arm to work freely and not operate
the diaphragm. The spring behind the
diaphragm maintains a constant pressure
of fuel to the carburetor float chamber,
thus the stroke of the diaphragm is auto-
matically governed to meet the require-
ments of the carburetor. The rocker arm
is spring loaded for quiet operation and
to keep in contact with the camshaft.
Some models of this pump are provided
with hand primers so that the engine need
not turn over to prime the system.
The Amal Fuel Pump belongs in the
cam-operated, flexible diaphragm class
and operates the same as the A.C. except
that its position is inverted and the lever
arm operates from the bottom of the cam
shaft. This pump is usually fitted with a
hand primer also.
The Tecalemit Fuel Pump is suitable
for use with gasoline, benzine, or fuel oil,
and has a low working pressure giving
steady delivery of 0 to 18 gal. per hour as
required. It uses light stainless steel disc
valves and an air dome which smooths
out diaphragm pulsations, prevents flood-
ing and acts as a starting reservoir.
Combined Fuel and Vacuum Pumps.
There are several commercial pumps of
this type on the market today. They have
a vacuum pump at the top which is uti-
lized to maintain constant vacuum for the
windshield wiper at all engine speeds.
The fuel pump operates the same as the
A.C. model, and the vacuum pump has
the same diaphragm action except that
Combined Fuel and Vacuum Pump.
it is operated by an extension of the
rocker arm and is inverted. The vacuum
pump does not operate when the wipers
are not, because the diaphragm is held up
and the rocker arm operates freely with-
out moving the diaphragm. The rocker
arm movement pushes the diaphragm into
the air chamber against spring pressure
(60 to 80 lbs.). Pressure created by the
diaphragm movement expels air through
the outlet port and into the manifold. On
the low point of the cam, the return stroke
is made which releases the compressed
diaphragm spring, creating a vacuum and
driving air through the inlet valve from
the windshield wiper.
Petrolift Electric Fuel Pump. This
pump consists of a metal tube which con-
tains a hollow iron pump plunger, which
is lifted by a solenoid wound outside the
tube. The iron plunger contains a disc
valve, and there is a foot valve at the
bottom of the metal tube, so that the ac-
tion is that of an ordinary lift-pump. The
solenoid draws the hollow iron plunger
upwards, thus drawing fuel from the
main tank and at the same time lifting
the fuel above the plunger into the upper
part of the container. When the contact is
broken, the plunger falls due to gravity

required in binary arithmetic. A bank
of relays, one representing each digit of
the binary system, could be connected to
a set of contacts so that momentarily
closing the contacts representing l's in a
number would send a signal closing the
corresponding relays; those representing
O's would remain open. Then by closing
the contacts representing l's in a second
number: relays open and receiving no
signal would remain open, relays open
and receiving a signal would close, relays
closed and receiving no signal would re-
main closed, and the relays could be so
interconnected that those relays closed
and receiving a second signal would open
and instantaneously transmit a signal to
the next higher relay in the bank. A bank
of relays so connected follows all the
rules of addition previously stated, so
that by noting the final positions of the
relays, the sum could be read off. Such a
bank or relays is called a register, and is
the heart of the high speed electronic
digital computer.
In actual practice, even a relay is too
slow for modern machines, and an elec-
tronic relay circuit, called a flip-flop, is
used in its place.
If a positive pulse is fed into input A,
tube A begins to conduct and the plate
becomes more negative. This causes the
grid of tube B to become negative, and
tube B does not conduct. If the pulse is
fed into input B, the conditions reverse.
Thus the circuit has the characteristics of
a relay; either one tube or the other is
conducting. The flip-flops can be con-
nected in a bank or register so that they
will perform binary arithmetic just as the
mechanical relays did, only thousands of
times faster. Many modern machines
operate at a megacycle pulse rate. This
means that a number is fed into the
register every micro-second. Thus, addi-
tions and subtractions can be performed
(Continued from page 13)
at the rate of one million per second.
Multiplications and divisions are only
scries of additions and subtractions, and
can be performed in corresponding
periods of time, usually about 50 micro-
seconds.
It is obvious that numbers and instruc-
tions could not be manually fed into com-
puters operating at such high speeds. The
devices which make high speed automatic
machines possible are a memory and
programming. In modern computers, all
the numbers to be used in the problem
are fed into the machine at the beginning
of the problem, and they are recorded in
the memory. While the computer is
working a complex problem, numbers are
often stored in the memory for use at
later stages in the computations. Mem-
ories are merely mechanisms for record-
ing the electrical impulses which repre-
sent numbers and sending them back into
the circuit when they are needed. Mem-
ories are usually classified according to
access time: the time required for the
number to be returned to the circuit when
it is needed. One type of memory con-
sists of a rotating magnetic drum with
stationary recording and reading heads.
Such a drum is capable of storing thous-
ands of numbers, but even with rapid
rotation, the average access time is well
over one hundred micro-seconds. A
memory with a shorter access time uses a
mercury tube with a vibrator at one end
and a crystal pickup at the other. These
are connected by an amplifier so that a
number fed into the tube will be trans-
mitted as sound to the opposite end, pick-
ed up, amplified, and sent around the
cycle again. Such tubes have a capacity
of only eight or ten numbers, but the ac-
cess time is about eight micro-sec-
onds. Most large computers have both a
slow access and a rapid access memory so
that those numbers used most often are
quickly accessable, and a large amount of
other information is available without in-
creasing the expense of the machine exces-
sively.
Since the digital computer can only
perform one simple operation at a time,
expert programming or instruction is
necessary for the machine to solve com-
plex problems. Directions are coded
and sent into the machine in the same
way as numbers. A sample direction
might say, "Take the number in memory
cell 21 and add to the number in register
A. Then go to memory cell 86 for the
next direction." It is often necessary for
the computer to spend many steps on a
seemingly simple operation, such as tak-
ing the root of a number. For such opera-
tions the machine must use a converging
series or a series of successive approxima-
tions, any term of which may take many
steps to calculate. The programmer may
place sub-routines for often needed com-
putations in the memory so that they
may be used whenever needed in solving
problems. Since the machine will not
know when something goes wrong, it is
essential that the programmer anticipate
all the possibilities in such problem, (such
as the possibility of imaginary roots). To
guard against part failure, in many com-
puters the entire problem is worked in
duplicate.
In spite of the delays and repetitions
necessary in digital computers, techno-
logical advances have made it possible
for them to solve problems more than
20,000 times as fast as a professional
mathematician with a desk calculator.
Since the actual digits of the number are
used, the accuracy obtained is limited
only by the number of places you wish
to carry the answer to.
ANALOG COMPUTERS
Early analog computers were mechani-
cal in nature. Values were usually repre-
sented by rotation of shafts. Numbers
could be added and subtracted by a differ-
ential similar to that in an automobile.
The revolutions of the output shaft equal
one half the algebrac sum of the two
input shaft rotations just as the drive
shaft revolves half as many times as the
two rear wheels on a car.

(Continued from page 17)
of mechanics are mentioned briefly in the opening chapter
of the Principia where they are laid down as working
rules to be used later in the book. But D*Alembert's book
gives a full and philosophical discussion of the laws of me-
chanics. It became the model on which all later texts on
mechanics were patterned containing two parts—the first
part on statics and the second part on dynamics. D'Alembert
deduces no new fundamental principles. His three basic
principles are Newton's three laws stated in somewhat dif-
ferent terms. But these principles needed full discusion, even
56 years after the appearance of the Principia—a book
which then still caused as much bewilderment to scholars as
Einstein's General Theory of Relativity does today. D'Alem-
bert pointed out clearly that forces were not directly ap-
prehensible by any of the five senses but were only known
through their effects which were the accelerations of bodies.
The three basic principles merely defined the word "force" in
terms of its effects. Newton's laws concern themselves mere-
ly with the motion of free particles—for that is what the
planets may be considered in the type of motion considered in
the Principia. D'Alembert's greatest achievement in his
Treatise was to show how the principles could be used on
the motion of constrained particles and bodies. This has
direct bearing on all engineering problems of motions since
machines are combinations of parts which must move in
definitely determined (constrained) ways.
D'Alembert's principle which gives the solution for con-
strained motion is worth quoting as a matter of historical in-
terest. It is always mentioned but never quoted.
General Problem. Let there be given a system of bodies
disposed with respect to one another in any manner whatever,
and suppose that we impress on each of these bodies a par-
ticular motion which it cannot follow because of the action of
the other bodies. Find the motion which each body must take.
Solution. Let A, B, C, . . ., etc. be the bodies which com-
pose the system, and let us suppose that we have impressed on
them the motions a, b, c, . . ., etc. which they are forced, be-
cause of their mutual actions, to change into the motions a', b/,
c', . . ., etc. It is clear that we may regard the motion a im-
pressed on the body A as composed of the motion a' which it
has actually taken, and of another motion a; that we may
in the same way regard motions b, c, . . ., etc. as composed
of the motions b', /?; c', T; . . ., etc. when it follows
that motion of the bodies A, B. C, . . . between them would
have been the same if, instead of the impulses a, b, c, . . . they
had received the double impulses a', a; b', /?; c/,T; . . .
But by hypothesis, the bodies A, B. C, . . . actually have the
motions a', b', d, . . . Hence the motions a, f3, T, . . . must

L ighly-skilled chemists in well-equipped
laboratories may come forth with anything
from a new spray for protecting apples
against disease and insects to a method for
synthesizing benzene from crude oil fractions.
In the latter case, petroleum industry
scientists had to run a race with a threat-
ened critical shortage. Production of such
things as synthetic rubber, nylon, styrene
and phenol plastics, aniline dyes, sulfa
drugs, insecticides and certain types of mili-
tary explosives was endangered.
By use of the hydroforming process, which
Standard Oil scientists helped to perfect, our
technical men synthesized benzene from pe-
troleum naphthas—and in large quantities.
In fact, at Standard Oil's Whiting, Indi-
ana plant, benzene production capacity
has risen in the past year to 16 million gal-
lons. In addition, according to the Petro-
leum Administration for Defense, other
refineries ultimately will produce many
times this amount as the petroleum indus-
try's answer to the chemical industry's
urgent need for large additional quantities
of this vital fluid.
Success in producing benzene commer-
cially is only one of the many benefits de-
rived from the petroleum industry's more
than $130 million annual expenditure on
research and technical services.
At Standard Oil alone 2,500 persons de-
vote full time to research and engineering.
Young college-trained technical men will
find the wide variety of subjects under in-
vestigation and the keen competition in the
petroleum industry stimulating to scientific
thought.

A machine composed of these various
components was able to solve many types
of problems, including differential equa-
tions, rapidly and fairly accurately, but
the accuracy was limited to the mechanical
precision of the many parts. Another dis-
advantage of this type of machine was
the necessity for cumbersome changing of
the gears and re-arrangement and re-
coupling of the mechanical components
each time the problem was changed.
Certain electronic circuits were found to
have properties useful in analog com-
puters, and today most large machines
consist almost entirely of electronic equip-
ment, using mechanical components only
where no electrical substitute has yet been
found.
The basic electronic computing cir-
cuit consists of a DC amplifier connected
as shown.

If the amplifier used has a high gain,
then e, is very small and the current into
the amplifier is also very small. If these
values are neglected, we can conclude
that:

By changing Z, and Z2 the above circuit
can be made to perform several mathe-
matical operations on the voltage. If Z,
and Z2 are true resistances, then Jhe vol-
tage is multiplied by a constant, R2/R,.
Rr
It must be noted that there is a sign
change in each stage in this type of com-
puter. If the correct sign is required,
another amplifier is added with equal
resistances to multiply the voltage by
minus one.
If Z2 is a pure resistance and Zx is a
pure capacitance, then the circuit dif-
ferentiates the input voltage.

Since el/p is the integral with respect to

integration, the output is divided by the
frequency, and stray high frequency leak-
age does not greatly affect the integrator
output.
Voltages may be added by feeding
them into a single amplifier through sepa-
rate resistances.

amplifier in this and following draw-
ings.)
Since iA + iB=i1=i2

If RA, RB, and Z2 are equal resistances,
the voltages are added directly, and either
or both of the voltages may be multiplied
by a constant before addition by changing
the appropriate resistor. The sign of any
voltage can be changed by running it
through an amplifier multiplying it by a
negative one. Multiplication by a vari-
able can be affected by varying one of the
resistances in the manner required. One
method for doing this is to use a rheostat
connected to a cam cut to match the vary-
ing function.
These amplifiers can be inter-connected
to solve an arithmetical problem, but
their most important use is in solving
differential equations. An example of
how the components would be connect-
ed to solve a simple damped oscillation
problem is shown on page 48.
After the proper connections are made,
initial conditions are set on the computer.
Since the output voltage of an amplifier
is equal to the voltage across the feedback
impedance (Z2), the initial conditions
for any two of y, y', and y", can be set by
imposing appropriate voltages across the
feedback impedances. (Only two initial
conditions are used in this problem to
avoid redundancy.) Solutions from
analog computers are usually plotted by
automatic voltage run plotting tables
which ink a graph of the output function
along a time base. (All derivatives are
with respect to time.) The plotting table
can be connected to any function in the

through the valve to the upper side of the
plunger, ready for the next lifting move-
ment.
The unit which makes and breaks the
contact for current to the solenoid is a
tricky device worth describing. Above
the head of the plunger and normally in
contact with it, there is a light sleeve of
iron to which is attached a piston rod.
The piston rod passes through a cork
float and has a boss on the end, so that
the rod can slide upwards through the
center of the float, but if the float rises as
high as the end of the rod, it carries the
rod and piston with it. The light iron
sleeve serves to complete the magnetic
circuit between the poles of two small
permanent magnets which are placed
around the tube. Outside the tube there
is also a rocking device of iron, which
carries the contact point. When the iron
sleeve is at the lower end of its stroke,
it completes the magnetic circuit between
the lower poles of the permanent mag-
nets, so that the upper poles are free to
attract the rocking device, which then

DIGEST
JOB WITH A FUTURE-
Varied experiences in a Du Pont chemical plant
fit young engineers for higher responsibility
As was pointed out in the last issue of
the D igest, Du Pont's many product
lines afford men interested in pro-
duction supervision experience in a
wide -variety of operations.
For a better idea of what the work
involves, let's consider a specific case
—the production of "Mycoban" so-
dium and calcium propionates, in-
hibitors used by bakeries to extend
the mold-free life of bread and other
baked goods.
Many of the problems encountered
in the manufacture of "Mycoban"
are similar to those arising in the
manufacture of any Du Pont chemi-
cal. There is the same continuing
effort to improve quality, while cut-
ting costs through the better use of
equipment, instrument controls and
raw materials.
The supervisor works hand in hand
with the plant technical section to-
ward these goals. He also keeps him-
self informed on technological and
economic trends affecting production
and sales, finds explanations for out-
of-line costs, and prepares plans and
estimates for increasing production.
Such work obviously calls for a
sound technical background. In ad-
dition, however, considerable admin-
istrative ability is needed. A super-
visor must be able to supervise. His
duties include keeping people under
him informed about long-range

changes in company policy and as-
suming responsibility for their safety
and morale.
The unusual problems encountered
in "Mycoban" production are largely
due to the seasonal nature of its sales.
Its greatest use is in the hot, humid
months, or from late spring to early
fall. For this reason:
1. Production and warehouse inven-
tories of "Mycoban" must be care-
fully balanced against sales forecasts.
The supervisor gathers necessary
background information for this op-
eration.
2. Production needs, including man-
power, equipment and materials,
must likewise be planned to meet
sales forecasts.
3. Maintenance, including a yearly
hydrostatic test of the plant, must
be scheduled with the plant main-
tenance supervisor for the minimum
interference with peak-season pro-
duction. Emergency maintenance
must be kept down by carefully
planned preventive maintenance.
As you can see, production super-
visors have a broad field of activity
at Du Pont. The experience gained
in this job will prepare an ambitious
man for advancement to positions
of still higher responsibility.

A New Aerial Weapon
A new aerial weapon "just over the
horizon" is the greatest argument for "an
all-out effort to establish world peace,"
J. H. Kindelberger, board chairman of
North American Aviation, Inc., Los An-
sel es, told the Industrial Section of the
Courtesy: Eastman Kodak
Kodak Contour Projector.
At West Point, Mr. R. Spall, Mr. D.
Stone, and Mr. J. Beattic, all of Detroit
Arsenal assisted in explaining various
phases of the Mobile Gage Laboratories
operations.
When in service the laboratory will
normally be staffed by three civilian gage
inspectors. It is atmospherically controll-
ed for maintenance of the 68 degree
Fahrenheit temperature required for gage
checking. It will be used primarily for
surveillance gage checking, rather than
original dimensional acceptance.
The Mobile Gage Laboratory was de-
California State Chamber of Commerce
at its annual meeting in San Francisco to-
day.
Discussing "Air Power Today and To-
morrow," Mr. Kindelberger referred to
the new weapon as "the true intercontin-
ental guided missile which some day will
be a reality. It is a weapon which will be
capable of accurately delivering to any
point on the surface of the earth in a few
hours, a warhead carrying infinite destruc-
tion, and which because of its speed and
altitude will be impossible to intercept."
Pointing out that technical problems
make it impossible to predict how soon
this weapon will be available, Mr. Kindel-
berger asserted that the aircraft industry
"is going through a technical hell" be-
cause of the fast-moving advances in the
aeronautical sciences.
Among "engineering headaches," Mr.
Kindelberger listed the "synthesis of re-
actions which utilize just about every field
of physical science and a few which
haven't been invented yet," and the heat
barrier at which many known materials
lose enough of their strength at very high
speeds to be impractical for future air-
frame structures.
"The balance of air power," he said,
"depends upon solution of these and
scores of similar problems. It seems un-
thinkable that the nation which gave birth
to air power should become its victim.
It need not happen. I have considerable
faith in our ability to come out on top in
any long race that involves technical skill
and productive resources."
The head of the aircraft company
which has built more airplanes than any
other company in the world told his audi-
ence that it takes from 18 to 24 months
after receipt of an order to start delivering
finished airplanes, and that span is for a
proven, in-production fighter plane. "We
are a long way downstream from a speech
in Congress," he observed.
Mr. Kindelberger sounded a word of
optimism concerning the country's present
status of air power by reporting that
"North American alone is now produc-
ing almost as many military planes each
month as the whole industry was pro-
ducing when the Korean war began.
"I believe that we have qualitative su-
periority today, and that we will soon
have the Russians' quantitative super-
iority whittled down to the point where
we can live with it."
Mr. Kindelberger gave a word of praise
to engineering and procurement people
in the Air Force and Navy for "an excel-
lent job on one of the toughest procure-
ment assignments in the world."

Engineers get ahead at Boeing
A major guided missile program is just
one of Boeing's many projects-with-a-
future. Other programs, which offer you
plenty of room to get ahead in engineer-
ing, are America's first-announced jet
transport project, research in supersonic
flight and nuclear-powered aircraft, and
development of the B-47 and B-52 jet
bombers, the airplanes that have given
Boeing more experience with multi-
engine jets than any other company.
No other industry approaches this one
in offering young engineers such a wide
range of experience, or such breadth
of application — from pure research to
production design, all going on at once.
Aircraft development is such an inte-
gral part of our national life that young
graduates can enter it with full expec-
tation of a rewarding, long-term career.
Boeing, for instance, is now in its 36th
year of operation, and today employs
more engineers than at the peak of
World War II.
Boeing engineering activity is concen-
trated at Seattle in the Pacific Northwest
and Wichita in the Midwest. Both com-
munities offer fine fishing, hunting, golf,
boating and other recreational opportu-
nities. Both are fresh, modern cities with
fine residential and shopping districts,
and schools of higher learning where en-
gineers can study for advanced degrees.
There are openings in ALL branches
of engineering (mechanical, civil, electri-
cal, aeronautical and related fields) for
work in aircraft DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT,
PRODUCTION, RESEARCH and TOOLING. Also
for servo-mechanism and electronics de-
signers and analysts, and phvsicists and
mathematicians with advanced degrees.

Van Type Fuel Injection Pump. Fuel
injection pumps have to be supplied with
fuel oil under pressure because they have
insufficient suction ability. For this rea-
son all injection pumps require a supply
pump to transfer fuel from the supply
tank to the injection pump. Pumps for
this purpose have a positive suction life,
their performance does not vary with
variable viscosities, pressure, or tempera-
ture of the fuel. There are 3 types gen-
erally used—the gear, the plunger, or the
vane type.
The vane type employs a revolving
steel rotor which operates in a pump body
that is eccentric to the rotor. Two sliding
vanes, 180 degrees apart, in the rotor are
expanded against the body bore by coil
springs. Two oil seals on the pump shaft
act to prevent leakage of fuel or lube oil.
As the shaft rotates the vanes pick up
fuel at the inlet port and carry it around
to the outlet side, where it is discharged.
Pressure is produced by the wedging ac-
tion of the fuel as it is forced toward the
outlet port. The relief valve (a horizontal
spring loaded valve) is provided in the

Plunger Type Fuel Pump. This type
pump is usually mounted directly on the
housing of the injection pump and is
driven by the camshaft. It is a variable
stroke self regulating plunger type of
pump which will only build up pressure-
to a certain predesignated point.
As the pump cam allows the plunger to
be forced by its spring toward the cam-
shaft, the suction effect created opens the
inlet valve and permits the fuel to enter
the plunger-spring chamber. Then, as the
cam lobe drives the plunger against its
spring, the fuel is forced by the plunger
through the outlet valve and around into
the chamber created in back of the
plunger by its forward motion. As the in-
jection pump cam continues to rotate, it
allows the plunger spring (now under
compression) to press the plunger back-
ward again, forcing the fuel oil behind

about stainless curtain walls
Modern construction methods have changed walls from the
self-supporting type to a mere covering which does not sup-
port its own weight for more than one or two stories. Hence
the definition of "curtain wall":—the facing or enclosure of
the structural steel frame. This frame supports the entire
weight of modern buildings.
The need has existed for a covering that would not only
clothe the building, but be lightweight, economical and
space saving. Because these requirements are more than ade-
quately met with stainless steel curtain wall construction,
this method is becoming increasingly popular with cost and
space conscious owners, builders and architects.
the
CMW.miE
"sandwich'
the CRUCIBLE "sandwich"-only 6" thick
(fan be less)
Crucible stainless steel curtain wall panels are in the
form of 6-inch thick "sandwiches". The facing consists of
flanged. light-gauge stainless steel sheets with a factory,
or site-fabricated, sandwich consisting of cellular glass
insulation between two layers of concrete with connect-
ing reinforcing. Crucible 18-8 stainless as the outside face
offers excellent resistance to weather and fire while pro-
viding eternal beauty with a minimum of maintenance;
the inside face can be finished or painted to suit the re-
quirements of modern building interiors. Since 18-8 is
restricted in use, a good substitute material, type 430
stainless, now government decontrolled, offers the same
benefits as 18-8 stainless.
moisture penetration
The unique characteristics of the cellular glass insulation
stop moisture vapor migration from one face of the
panel to the other. The cellular insulation properly de-
signed and installed assures that condensation will not
take place anywhere within the sandwich.
insulation
Although less than half as thick as the usual wall con-
struction, this Crucible stainless steel panel construction
has more than twice the insulating value. The "U" value
(overall thermal conductivity) is approximately 0.15
BTU Hr./Sq.Ft./°F.
fire resistance
The Crucible sandwich met the requirements of a
standard 4-hour fire test conducted io the testing
laboratories of the National Bureau of Standards.
This meets all old building codes and is double, or
better, the requirements of modern enlightened
building codes.
erection and fabrication
Since a building frame is not precision built, the
attachment of the panel walls to the frame is done
with fastening devices that provide necessary 3-
dimensional adjustment. Panels can be made at the
building site, and a 24-hour casting-to-fastening
cycle is possible.
technical service available
Though the use of some stainless steel is now re-
stricted, Crucible metallurgists and development
personnel are continuing to investigate improved
methods of curtain wall and other construction so
that better buildings can be built when stainless
is more freely available. For more information

Takes a lot to lay a carpet in the jungle
The scene is "darkest Africa".
But Africa is lightening. Man's quest
for minerals, for new areas for agriculture
and trade, is slashing ultra-modern, glar-
ing-white air strips in once impenetrable
jungle.
Those pavers, portable air compressors,
pumps and air tools—such as you might
see working a city street—are Worthing-
ton Blue Brutes going to "lay a carpet"
in that hole in the jungle.
Thus, Worthington, a major producer
of equipment for public works, industry
and farm, brings the fruits of American
technical genius to the strange places of
the world.
And illustrates, too, how the unique
American talent of diversification helps
public, employees and stockholders. For
Worthington makes many things—not
just construction equipment and pumps,
but also engines, water works machinery,
power transmission, petroleum equipment,
air conditioning and refrigeration, many
others.
Such diversification builds stability ...
makes Worthington, 112 years old, a strong
link in the chain of American business.

the plunger out into the fuel line leading
to the niters and injection pump. At the
same time the plunger is again creating a
suction effect which allows additional fuel
to flow through the inlet valve into the
spring chamber. This pumping action
continues as long as the fuel is being used
by the injection pump, fast enough to
keep the supply pressure from raising to
the point where it equals the force exerted
by the spring on the plunger. Then the
pressure between the supply pump and
the injection pump holds the plunger
stationary against the spring and away
from the cam. This prevents further
pumping actions until the pressure drops
enough to permit the plunger to resume
operation. This cycle is entirely auto-
matic and continues as long as the engine
is running.

pump is used mostly in tanks using diesel
engines and is mounted directly in the
fuel tank, usually near the bottom. The

by a worm or spiral gear directly from a
power take-off. The gear, driven by the
input shaft, drives a companion gear. The
fuel is forced into the pump cavity around
each gear, and out the other side into the
fuel passages provided. Meshing action of
the gear teeth, which prevents the fuel
from passing between the gears, forces
the fuel around the outside of each gear.
This pump is also provided with an over-
load relief valve which permits excess
fuel to be returned. This type of pump is
also used as an oil pump in most types of
internal combustion engines.
The Wobble Plate Pump. This system
is used in an injection system and differs
only in that a wobble plate fuel pump is a
part of the system. The wobble plate ac-
tuates plunger pumps for the system, and
the wobble plate is simply a circular plate
mounted on a shaft and set at an angle
to it so that as the shaft rotates, the plate
also rotates. Any particular spot on the
plate not only rotates but moves laterally
as well, providing motion and force neces-
sary to operate the plunger pumps.
This concludes my study of fuel pumps.
I cannot recommend any one type of
pump, for the type can be determined
only when the particular needs are re-
lated to the cost and operational data.
When the country's largest railroad
lOUdSpeaker SyStein was planned in the Baltimore
and Ohio's yards near Chicago, the choice of cable to be
used was a key factor. With 37 miles of underground
cable involved, subsequent maintenance costs could con-
ceivably be a major item if any but the best cable were
to be used.
Okonite cable was chosen for this job because of its
superior rubber insulation and the resistance of its
Okoprene sheath to alkalis, acids, oils and other corrosive
substances encountered in railroad yard installations. To-
day, 197 two-way loudspeakers, 50 paging speakers, a
complete telephone and printing telegraph system, and an
independent inter-communicating system between offices
in the yard are operated over Okonite cables in this
network.

graph of y", /, or y could be made.
An analog computer of this type is
capable of solving single and simultan-
eous differential equations of great com-
plexity. Variable coefficients can easily
be introduced by providing a mechanism
to vary the input resistance of the ap-
propriate amplifier according to the neces-
sary function. Since all connections are
electrical, changes in the computer can
easily be made with patch cords or selec-
tor switches. Accuracy of a computer of
this type is limited only by the precision
of the components used in the input and
feedback circuits, the accuracy of the re-
cording device, and voltage losses in the
connecting lines. In present day ma-
chines, accuracy of 0.1% is common,
and an accuracy of 0.01% can be ob-
tained. The graphical solutions are easily
used, since an infinite number of points
is plotted. The complete solution is
rapid; usually requiring the same time
as the action being studied, although
solutions can be speeded up or slowed
down by multiplying each problem co-
efficient by an appropriate constant. A
large electronic analog computer can be
used to solve one large problem, or be
used in several parts on completely dif-
ferent problems. The size of the com-
puters is limited only by economic con-
siderations. Machines are now in opera-
tion capable of performing over 80 inte-
grations simultaneously. The value of
such computers in solving complex prob-
lems in mechanics, aerodynamics, and
electronics is obvious.
CONCLUSIONS
Much of the recent development of
high speed electronic computers has been
done on government contract to aid our
national defense program. Some out-
standing advances have been made, such
as the "Typhoon" computer, (pictured
Pg. 12) built for the navy by RCA. This
computer, though mainly analog, per-
forms some operations by digital means.
The U/iiversity of Michigan Engineering
Research Institute has a great deal of fine
computing equipment, both in operation
and under construction, at its Willow
Run Research Center. When completed,
MIDAC, (Michigan Digital Automatic
Computer) will rival the best digital
computers in the world. Another digital

fied for security reasons, is even more
rapid. The two large electronic analog
computers belonging to ERI have recent-
ly been combined into one unit, and are
capable of solving the complex problems
encountered in guided missle control
studies.
Electronic computers have already
shown their value in research and de-
velopment work. Their application in the
fields of engineering and accounting
should be apparent. Not only can the
time spent by engineers in computation
be cut drastically, but in many cases the
delay and expense of constructing models
and running lengthy tests can be elimin-
ated by the use of high speed computers
to determine the characteristics of certain
designs which could not previously have
been calculated. The great need for com-
puters in the fields of accounting and
tabulation of data is emphasized by the
fact that over nine million persons in
the United States are engaged in clerical
work; much of which modern machines
could be designed to do.
In the past, large computers have been
designed individually for special projects,
and the costs have been high. Some large
machines built for the government cost
over a million . dollars. Now that the
principles are known, however, large
computers can be designed and produced
for science and industry at costs which
will make them practical in many differ-
ent fields. The widespread use of high
speed computers should add much to our
scientific progress and industrial power.

Rollpin is a hollow, split, cylindrically formed pin with chamfered
ends. It is simply driven into holes drilled to normal production toler-
ances. Because Rollpin is slightly larger than standard sized holes,
it compresses as inserted. It is self-locking—and vibration-proof—
because of the constant pressure it exerts against hole walls. Its shear
strength exceeds that of a cold rolled pin of the same diameter. Rollpin
is readily removed with a drift or pin punch—and can be reused.
Because of its versatility—and the production economies it makes
possible—Rollpin is finding wide usage in almost every phase of manu-
facturing activity. Write for design information on the Rollpin. It will
enable you to cut costs for many applications where use of rivets, set

Resolve the motions a, b, c, . . . im-
pressed on each body, each into two
others a', a', b', /?; d,?; . . . such that if
the motions a', b', c', . . . alone were
impressed on the bodies, they would be
able to conserve these motions (without
reciprocal effect) and that if the motions
a, /?, T, . . . alone were impressed on the
bodies, the system would remain at rest,
it is clear that a', b', c', . . . will be the
motions the bodies will assume in virtue
of their actions.
Having read thus far you know why
this famous principle is never quoted.
"It is clear," says D'Alembert. "Clear
as mud," says the reader. Nevertheless,
the principle is the beginning of dynam-
ics as you know it in the courses taught
in the Engineering College. The principle
did several important things:
1) It reduced dynamical problems to
problems in statics.
This was psychologically important, for
every interested scholar in 1743 knew
how to solve problems in statics.
2) It introduced "generalized coordin-
ates" to the world.
The generalized coordinates of a prob-
lem in dynamics can vary independently
of each other—fitting into the constrain-
ing conditions of the system.
3) It baptized inertia reactions as
"forces."
Engineers like this very much. The
terms "inertia forces" and "centrifugal
forces" are in daily use by engineers the
world over.
4) It brought dynamics down from
skiey astronomy into the field of every-
day mechanism.
The dynamics of astronomy is of little
direct use to the engineer, but D'Alem-
bert's principle strikes right to the heart
of all engineering problems.
5) This principle became the "jump-
ing off place" for Lagrange who later
gave to dynamics its most powerful ana-
lytical tools for tackling the most compli-
cated problems.
These tools, also, you will never know
unless you become graduate students.
In spite of all this, D'Alembert plays a
rather minor role in the life of an engi-
neering student. The student usually
studies Newtonian mechanics only. And
when he studies these two important
principles that say, "The change in
kinetic energy equals the work done by
the forces acting on the system" and "the
change in momentum equals the total
impulse of all forces acting on the sys-
tem," he does not realize that D'Alembert
was the first to enunciate these principles
in the Treatise on Dynamics. History
has played another scurvy trick on
D'Alembert. He considered the "mass
times acceleration" as the only real, meas-
urable thing known about the motion of
bodies. But now his "inertia forces" are
often called "imaginary forces." He con-
sidered the external forces which appear
in the rest of the equation as hypotheses
specifically framed to fit the real knowl-
edge of acceleration. But now these
forces are often called "real forces."
Shed a tear for poor, forgotten, mis-
quoted D'Alembert.
Elimination of wasteful friction is a constant battle con-
fronting Industry. Out on the job . . . irrespective of your
engineering role . . . you'll be coming to grips with this
problem.
In the past, Industry has learned to rely upon acsi?" for
practical solutions to anti-friction bearing problems.

How to keep a high speed
boring mill accurate
To insure table accuracy in high speed boring mills,
spindle vibration must be eliminated. That's why de-
signers mount the table spindles on Timkcn• precision
tapered roller bearings. They hold spindles in positive
alignment, eliminate vibration. Line contact between
rollers and races of Timken bearings provides extra
load-carrying capacity. The true rolling motion and
incredibly smooth surface finish of Timken bearings
practically eliminate friction and wear within the
bearing itself.
How spindle and drive
shafts are mounted
on TIMKEN bearings
The drive of a high speed boring mill is mounted
on single row type TS, and two row type TNA
bearings. Input, intermediate and bevel pinion
shafts are mounted on two type TS bearings on
one end, and a two row type TNA bearing free
to float on the opposite end. Single row type TS
bearings are indirectly mounted on the main
table vertical spindle.

problem indeed. For irrigation enabled
the Indians for the last half century to
utilize the land two and threefold with-
out replenishing it by means of intensive
fertilization, and so exhausted the land.
The cure for this situation lies in an in-
tensive development of fertilizer. Com-
posting of sewage and garbage has a
great possibility in that field. Further re-
search in composting is highly desirable
in the United States and the development
of compost would be a boon to the under-
developed countries where that form of
fertilizer is the only available means of
replenishing the soil. Again vigorous edu-
cation must be conducted in the field of
soil conservation.
Puerto Rico is an example of success in
revitalization of a nation. (Civil Engi-
neering, August 1952). In 1940, Puerto
Ricans were living in an atmosphere of
"grief, disease, misery, and despair."
Their hopes for the future were dark.
Then the government sponsored a vast in-
dustrialization and environmental im-
provement program. Since 1940, 1000

miles of roads have been built, two hun-
dred new industries have been establish-
ed, general health has been improved,
and the island income has been increased
from $200 million to $900 million in
1952—450% in twelve years. Of 2]/4
million inhabitants 710 thousand drink
water completely treated in modern and
efficient filtration plants.
The example of Puerto Rico not only
gives an insight into the results of en-
lightened action, but also into the financ-
ing of similar huge world wide under-
takings. If a country can increase its
income by 450% because of a rise in
standards, then the undertaking is a good
risk.- Aid that is given today in millions
of dollars in outright gifts can be con-
verted into loans of machinery and skills.
These loans would have as collateral the
potential increase in income accrued be-
cause of these projects.
We must not overlook a danger spot in
this program. Native engineers returning

plan projects equal to the most gigantic
ones in this country. Sometimes with the
aid of American consultants, who are at
times pressured to act against their own
better judgments, they will embark upon
grandiose schemes that are absolutely
impossible of fulfillment. Thus for years
some of these countries will be flashing
Utopian schemes while in practice they
will still be wallowing in their mystery.
A good consultant will not discourage the
grand scheme, but will use it as an over-
all flexible framework within which im-
mediate local and practical projects can
be worked out; at some future date
these projects can become integrated into
a larger scheme. By all means, it is
necessary to scrap a project of twofold
benefit which cannot be started, in favor
of a project, half its size, which is imme-
diately practical. For on the strength of
the latter, the nation will be able to im-
bark on the former.
World survival depends upon the re-
demption of the wasted lands and their
peoples. For the total wealth and wel-
fare of the world cannot exceed that of its
components. Fortunately, many technical
obstacles that were previously in the
way are gradually being resolved. In the
last thirty years, the science of soil me-
chanics has progressed so rapidly, that
hydraulic engineers have confidence in
the building of stable earth- and rock-fill
dams—an important matter in under-
developed countries, where masonry and
concrete dams are prohibitive in cost.
Modern machinery and know-how furn-
ished from the United States, together
with the huge mass of native labor can
handle these projects. An intensive or-
ganized effort on the part of the engi-
neering profession and the nations in-
volved, can bring to fruition these
schemes for increasing world productiv-
ity.

Materials Engineering is a new curriculum offered by the Department of Chemical and Metallur-
gical Engineering. The rapid developments in science and industry are making increasing demands
for materials to withstand extreme conditions: very high and very low temperatures, radiations, corro-
sive or otherwise deteriorating influences. Our natural resources are overtaxed to meet these demands
along with those of our every-day products.
This program has for its objective the training of men in the understanding of the properties, the
limitations, and the applications of engineering materials. The field covers metals and alloys, plastics,
glass and ceramics, and protective coatings. Materials engineers play an important role where it is
necessary to replace existing materials to improve the product, to reduce cost or service failures, or
where shortages have developed in specific raw materials. They will find opportunities in the develop-
ment of new products, specifications of materials for design, development of new applications for a
given material, or even in engineering sales.
The above picture shows a portion of the protective coatings laboratory in which organic finishes
fpr protection against corrosion and for attractive appearances are investigated.

To think! We regard as sacred the right to think
as we please. Yet to what degree do we utilize this
right? Much of the time we sit back and either re-
fuse to think at all or allow someone else to do our
thinking for us. Then again it is made difficult for
us to think by those who wish to protect us from the
harsh reality of having to think.
Let me cite a few examples of this lack of think-
ing. Political speeches, in theory at least, are sup-
posed to promote thinking on the part of the audi-
ence. Yet far too often we have political gatherings
at which a group of Republicans meet to hear a fel-
low Republican extoll the Republican platform and
praise the Republican leaders and their accomplish-
ments. Just as often are similar gatherings at which
Democrats, addressed by another Democrat, hear the
virtues of the Democratic party enumerated at length
and the Democratic bosses spoken of with reverence.
But how thought provoking is it to listen while a
speaker tells you what you already believe? Thinking
is encouraged when we hear opinions different from
our own and contrast these opinions with our ideas.
How much more thinking would be inspired at an
open debate between speakers of the rival parties!
Most workers in industry have very unrealistic
notions of the basic facts concerning the companies
they work for. Their ideas on who receives most of
the company's income and how large are its profits
are almost unbelievably far from the truth. They
have accepted too readily what the labor leaders
have told them and have failed to think indepen-
dently.
Here at the University of Michigan the adminis-
tration, perhaps in the fear that students will turn
to Communism if allowed to hear reputedly sub-
versive speakers, has in its omniscience wisely banned
all speakers who are even suspected of being subver-
sive. A university probably more than any other
place is an institution where students are taught to
think, encouraged to think—that is, encouraged to
think as long as there is no possible chance that they
might think the wrong things. To me, this approach
is basically wrong. Let both sides air their views.
Let students and non-students alike hear the con-
trasting ideas and decide, thoughtfully, for them-
selves. I hold that we should have nothing to fear
from such open discussions.
In our present battle against Communism within
this country our zeal in protecting the Constitution
from those who would destroy it is carrying us too
far. Our zeal is so great that we, ourselves, are
undermining the Constitution by redefining the right
of freedom of speech to apply only to certain people,
or, more specifically not to apply to certain others—
and all so unnecessarily. If Democracy is so much
superior to other forms of government, as I fervently
believe it is, then it stands to benefit by open com-
parison with Communism. Democracy is based upon
the ideal that the people are able to think and make
decisions intelligently. If we are to uphold Democ-
racy, we must keep faith in the ability of the people
to weigh the merits of Democracy and Communism
and make the wise choice. Only in totalitarian coun-
tries as was Germany under Hitler and as is Russia
today should the government fear the decision of a
people who have heard and given thought to both
sides. Let us encourage free thinking rather than
obstruct it. Surely we can use more careful thought,
not less. And let us feel confident that the principles
of Democracy will be reaffirmed and strengthened
by such thought.

How to turn a high strength steel cup
inside out, cold
Offhand, anyone familiar with high
strength steels would say it couldn't be
done. But one of our customers does
it every day.
Employing a unique reverse-drawing
method and usinga U-SS High Strength
Steel especially adapted for this process,
they turn out cylindrical containers of
various kinds that are not only stronger
than those made from carbon steel but
weigh substantially less.
To accomplish this, the steel has to
meet two entirely opposite require-
ments. It has to be so strong that it
can be used in thinner gages to reduce
weight, and yet must have enough duc-
tility to satisfy the drastic fabrication
method that would be considered se-
vere even for carbon steel.
This method is used to draw cups
for large, low-pressure cylinders. These
cups, 14 &gt; ■&gt; in. in diameter and 24 V^ in.
deep, are drawn cold, from 12-gage
^^^^ steel blanks in one con-
^tf Ptt tinuous stroke in a re-
mT^^^M verse draw press. The
B Iw^l^J diagrams at left show
^B^^^OjM how it is done.
Starting with a 38 in. diameter steel
blank (Fig. 1) the press first draws the
steel into a shallow cup (Fig. 2). As
the stroke continues, the cup is literally
turned inside out (Fig. 3) to form the
finished cup (Fig. 4) which has very
uniform wall thickness. Two of these
cups are then welded together to make
a cylinder.
Made with high strength steel, cyl-
inders weigh about 20 lbs. less. The
maker gets 26% more cylinders from
each ton of steel used. Lighter weight
makes cylinders easier to handle, and
also pays off in lower freight costs—
both on the steel from our mills and on
cylinders shipped. (A customer 500
miles away saves as much as $100 per
carload.)
Developing special steels for special
customer needs is an important job of
United States Steel metallurgists and
engineers. With their tremendous back-
ground of practical experience, they are
ready to work on any problem that in-
volves the more efficient use of steel.

A boy on roller skates pushing on a
wall to get started; a man pushing down
on the arms of a chair so that he can
stand up; an automobile tire trying to
push the pavement backward so that the
car can move forward—all use the same
basic principle of propulsion as does the
turbojet engine. This principle is stated
by Newton's Third Law of Motion: "For
every action there is an equal and oppo-
site reaction." Although in each of these
examples movement in one direction is
gained by directing a force in the opposite
direction against a relatively immovable
mass, Newton's Law applies equally well
in cases wherein the opposite force is
directed against an easily movable mass.
For example, consider the oarsmen in
a racing shell, who impart forward mo-
the rearward velocity of a fluid—water,
air, or gas—Newton's Third Law of Mo-
tion was expanded and restated in the
Momentum Law. The Momentum Law
states that "the resultant of forces acting
on the boundaries of any arbitrary region
is equal in magnitude and direction to the
summation of the time rate of change of
momentum of the particles or bodies
within the region. The region (not neces-
sarily rigid) must contain the same par-
ticles during the differential "dt." In
other words, the thrust developed by the
men and their oars, the propellers of a
plane or ship, or the turbojet engine, is
equal to the change in momentum they
impart to the fluid through which they
are moving.
Utilizing the definition of momentum,
Actually, the turbojet engine is a mech-
anized version of the racing-shell-oars-
men engine, converting the chemical
energy of fuel into the mechanical energy
needed to increase the momentum of a
portion of the fluid through which it is
passing. It, too, may increase its thrust by
accelerating a greater mass of air to the
same velocity, by accelerating the same
mass to a higher velocity, or a combina-
tion of both. To see how this may be ac-
complished, it is first necessary to have an
understanding of the operation of a tur-
bojet.
As shown in the Figure, the basic com-
ponents of a turbojet are (1) an air inlet
diffuser, (2) an air compressor, (3) a
combustor, (4) a turbine, and (5) an ex-
haust nozzle. The compressor and tubine

tion to the shell by applying a rearward
force to the water. Actually, they gain
motion by increasing the rearward veloc-
ity of the water through which they are
passing. Since the speed of the shell de-
pends upon the size of the oars and the
frequency of strokes, the reaction that
moves the boat forward—called "thrust"
—must depend upon the amount of water
or mass, handled and the extent to which
its velocity is increased.
To more easily explain the phenomenon
of gaining forward motion by increasing
thrust is shown to be equal to the mass
of the fluid being acted upon multiplied
by the charge in velocity imparted to the
mass. Therefore, to increase the forward
speed of its craft, the engine must either
handle a greater mass, or it must propel
a given mass faster. It is easy to see that
the thrust of propeller-driven craft can be
increased by using a larger propeller, or
by driving a given propeller at a higher
rpm, just as the oarsmen in a racing shell
would have to increase the effective size
of the oars, or row faster.

are directly connected by a shaft.
Depending upon the speed of the air-
plane, atmospheric air is either drawn or
rammed into the inlet diffuser. This dif-
fuser changes a part of the velocity of the
air into pressure and directs the air into
the compressor. The compressor then in-
creases the pressure of the air to the point
where, upon entering the combustion
chamber, the air may be at a pressure of
anywhere from 3 to 16 times that in the
inlet diffuser, depending upon the de-
signed compression ratio of the engine.
In the combustion chamber, about 25
percent of the air is mixed with fuel and
the mixture ignited. The balance of the

ON LAKE MICHIGAN
BY
WILLIAM H. STRICKLER, '53 Met. E
One of the more important links in the
transportation network of the United
States is the car ferry system operating
across Lake Michigan. A great percentage
of people know little or nothing about it,
however. The purpose of this article is
to give an informative, descriptive sur-
vey of the system by focusing on a part
of the system, namely, the Ann Arbor
Railroad car ferry fleet of five boats which
operates out of Frankfort, Michigan.
The article will consider briefly the de-
velopment of the car ferry, then will
survey present day design and opera-
tional features of the boats. Included will
be descriptions of the hull, superstruc-
ture, engine room, cargo space, passen-
ger accommodations, crew's quarters, and
docking facilities. Operational features
such as complement, methods of naviga-
tion and docking, cargo capacity, and
running costs will be given.
History of the System
Toward the latter part of the nine-
teenth century there arose a need for a
more expedient method of transporta-
tion between the East and Wisconsin,
Upper Michigan, and the northwestern
part of the United States. An idea was
advocated that perhaps the cars of freight
The stern of the Wabash.
could be ferried across Lake Michigan
on boats, thus eliminating shipment
around through Chicago, an already
crowded rail center in addition to being
100 miles farther. Capital was raised
and the Ann Arbor Railroad Company
formed. A single track was laid from
Toledo, Ohio, to Frankfort, Michigan, a
thriving lumber port on the west coast
of the lower peninsula, a distance of
296 miles.
No. 1 boat was built and put into
service in November of 1892, No. 2 boat
soon after. In 1898, the first steel car
ferry ever constructed was put into serv-
ice, and it is still running continuously
today. By 1920, the line had four steel
ferries (No. 1 and No. 2 had both
burned), of which it owned three and
leased one. In 1927 it leased the steamer
"Wabash" from the Wabash Railroad
Company. This boat, at the time, was the
ultimate in luxury and carrying capacity.
This brought the fleet up to six boats, of
which the company owned two. At the
present time the fleet numbers five boats
—the 3, 5, 6, 7, and "Wabash." In 1950
these five boats transported 91,943
freight cars across Lake Michigan be-
tween Frankfort and the western ports of
Manitowoc, Kewaunee, Menominee, and
Manistique.
Design
Evolution of the car ferry design was a
rather simple process. The first two boats,
No. 1 and No. 2, were constructed of
wood. They were quite small, having a
capacity of only 14 cars each, but were
sufficient at the time. Engines have re-
mained much the same on the Ann Arbor
line—twin, triple expansion, reciprocat-
ing engines. The Pere Marquette Rail-
road, however, has installed steam tur-
bines in its three newest boats. Docking
facilities, passenger and crew accommo-
dations, cargo space, superstructure, and
hull have remained essentially the same
except for size and appointments, which
are luxurious.
In order to comprehend fully the fol-
lowing section of the article, the reader is
referred to the diagram which is a sec-
tional elevation of a car ferry. The top
drawing is a side view and the three
lower ones are sectional top views at
three levels to show the inner works in
their respective locations. (See page 30.)
The hulls of all the boats are con-
structed of riveted steel plates over a
framework of steel ribs. They range in
size from 300 feet long, for boat No. 3,
to 380 feet long, for the Wabash. All

may break the ice in winter. Since they
run the year around, they sometimes en-
counter ice ranging up to eight and ten
feet thick and can break through only
by one pushing another. This punishment
requires a sturdily built hull.

varies from boat to boat; however, the
general set-up is nearly the same for all.
The pilot house is the first essential on
each boat. It is located well forward and
at a level above the rest of the super-
structure. In it is centered the control
mechanism of the boat. The wheel, com-
pass, radio direction receiving apparatus,
radar equipment, engine room telegraph,
and charts are centralized there. Sur-
rounded by windows, it gives an unob-
structed view of the boat and the sur-
rounding area to the captain or officer on
watch in order that he may direct it to
the best advantage. Being located high
on the boat, it is normally removed
from the danger of ice formation in win-
ter due to the splash of waves. Another
wheel is situated in the stern wheelhouse
to steer the boat when docking, since
that operation cannot be seen from the
pilothouse.
Below the pilothouse, and extending
back to the funnels, is the main deck-
house. It houses the staterooms which
range in number from six, on boat No. 6,
to eighteen, on the Wabash, the captain
and first officer's quarters, the radio
shack, the purser's office, and the main
lounge ranging from merely a hallway on
No. 6 to a spacious oak panelled room on
the Wabash. A steel canopy extends over
the deck to the edge of the hull outside
the deckhouse to serve as protection in
bad weather.
Aft of the main deckhouse are the
funnels which serve to create draft in the
boilers and to carry away the smoke.
(Boat No. 3 has only one funnel.) In
the case of the Wabash and No. 3, the
main deckhouse extends around the fun-
nels. The other three boats have a built-
up platform on which the funnels are
mounted. In either case, ventilators for
the engine room are also mounted beside
the funnels.
Behind the funnel housing is the aft
deckhouse. This houses the crew's quar-
ters, the galley where food is prepared,
and the mess halls.
Lifeboats are arranged in the most con-
venient manner, depending on the boat.
The Wabash carries six boats, while the
other car ferries carry only four.
The car deck is the principal com-
ponent of the car ferry. This is where the
payload is carried. Four tracks are laid
side by side to accommodate the freight
cars. A maximum pay load of 1500 tons
makes it imperative that this deck be
extremely strong. The stern of the
Wabash is shown on page 12. The car
deck may be seen in this picture in addi-
tion to the docking facilities which will
be referred to later.
The power to run the boat and all its
machinery comes from a central point, the
engine room in which are housed the
boilers. For reasons of stability, together
with providing more cargo space, the
engine room is located below the water
line for the most part.
Steam is generated in four, handfed,
Scotch, fire-tube boilers. The boilers are
174 inches in diameter, built of 1.358
inch steel plate. Maximum pressure al-
lowable is 185 psi, while operating pres-
sure is limited to 175 psi.
The engine room proper is a virtual
maze of piping and machinery cramped
into the smallest space possible. The main
propelling machinery is provided by twin,
triple-expanding, reciprocating steam
engines rated at 1350 horsepower (on the
Wabash). These are coupled to twin
screws capable of driving the boat at a
speed of 15-18 miles per hour on a calm
sea. Great maneuverability is afforded by
ing a double bunk and a washbowl. In
addition to staterooms, all of the boats,
with the exception of No. 6, provide
pleasant lounges where the passengers
may relax during the voyage. Deck chairs
are available to those who wish to re-
main on deck, and blankets are passed
out at night to those desiring to sleep on
deck. Dining halls are provided and good
meals served.
The aft deckhouse provides facilities
for the deck crew which are very pleasing
in contrast to the forecastle found on
many ocean-going ships. The engineroom
crew have quarters just aft of the engine
room which are comparable to the deck-
house facilities. The officers' suites are
commensurate with the rank of the par-
ticular officer. A total of 4 officers and
54 other crew members are thus accom-
modated in order to run the boats 24
hours a day.
The docking facilities are shown on
page 12. The apron is the main part of
the dock. It is a rectangular shaped flex-
ible structure constructed of wood. Two

this arrangement, as the speed of each
screw, together with its direction of turn-
ing, is quickly adjustable. Throwing one
screw in reverse, while holding the other
forward, results in swinging the boat
around in a very small area.
Other equipment in the engine room
are condensers, pumps, electric generat-
ing sets, donkey engines, control panels,
and a telegraph to the pilothouse.
The staterooms on the boats are small
rooms, about 8 by 8 feet in size, contain-
tracks lead onto it and switch into four
to meet the stern of the ferry. A heavy
beam with a counterweight at one end is
connected to the boat end of the apron in
order that it may be easily adjusted to the
various positions of the boat in the water.
Acting independently to correct for list,
the counterbalances keep the tracks in
vertical alignment. Horizontal alignment
is effected by two slots in the boat and
apron in which a steel bar is placed. In

INSTITUTE
In order to Increase genera! knowledge
about the Engineering Research Institute
and the nature of its work, we are reprint-
ing, with the permission and cooperation
of the Institute, their Annual Report 31.
We wish to thank Dr. B. A. Uhlendorf, edi-
tor of the Report, and Dr. A. E. White,
director of E.R.I., for assisting us to bring
you this report.
The Director is happy to report that
the year 1951-1952 was a year of unpre-
cedented growth. The volume of research
carried on was more than twice that of
the preceding year.
search is an industrial concern, a trade
association, or a municipal, state, or Fed-
eral agency, it is not only the sponsor
who derives profit from the research re-
sults, but, depending on the scope and
nature of the work, also the entire com-
munity, state, and country. In some cases
the research is even of world-wide sig-
nificance.
While fundamental research may not
always bring forth results that are imme-
diately applicable, it is apparent that it
too will eventually benefit society. Just

the instrumentation was designed on the Campus.
However, research should not be meas-
ured quantitatively, nor should it be ap-
praised in terms of dollars. Research is
above all a service for the benefit and
well-being of society, a service similar
to that of our educational system. Its far-
reaching benefits can be evaluated only
with difficulty.
The Engineering Research Institute,
formerly the Department of Engineering
Research, was established in 1920 to aid
the industries of the State of Michigan by
solving their research and production
engineering problems. Soon the scope of
its activities had to be broadened to meet
the demands of industries outside the
State, and in the early 1940's, when it
became evident that the world's reserve of
scientific resources was being rapidly de-
pleted, the range of work was still further
expanded in response to demands from
the Federal Government.
No matter whether the sponsor of re-
how much it will contribute to better
living and more leisure for the enjoyment
of the finer things of life is not always
predictable. It may be pointed out, how-
ever, that the basic research being done
for various Government agencies, espec-
ially the several branches of the Armed
Services, certainly makes our existence
more secure and permits us to enjoy what
we have without undue fear for the fu-
ture.
The Engineering Research Institute, as
an integral part of the University, enjoys
many of its service facilities; on the other
hand, the University benefits from cer-
tain contributions which the Institute
makes for the purposes of nonsponsored
University research.
Since a major portion of Institute re-
search done on the Campus is supervised
by members of the teaching staff, the In-
stitute makes contributions to those col-
leges and departments whose staffs par-
ticipate in the research activities of the
Institute.
During the past year a total of
$180,000 was thus disbursed. Nearly
$70,000 was spent to enable members of
the faculty and some doctoral candidates
to carry on specific research projects, and
over $26,000 to permit members of the
teaching and research staffs to attend
conferences of professional societies.
Some $85,000 was expended to improve
the physical facilities of the University.
Approximately $25,000 of this sum was
spent for new and improved building
facilities, most of it for a much-needed
addition to the high-temperature metal-
lurgy laboratory, and the remainder, near-
ly $60,000, for the purchase or construc-
tion of research equipment, which, in
general, was needed primarily for fac-
ulty research and instructional purposes.
The departments of instruction for
which important equipment was acquired
or put into condition to meet instructional
or research demands are:

Aside from the contributions to the
University proper, the Institute has been
contributing the major share of the up-
keep of the Willow Run Airport. During
the year 1951-52 it paid a total of
$144,000 in rental for the buildings occu-
pied by the Willow Run Research Center
and for space to house the several activi-
ties carried on under the supervision of
Campus personnel in airport buildings.
In addition to the $750,000 allotted
during 1950-51 toward the construction
of the Cooley Memorial Building, a con-
tribution of $125,000 was made during
the report year. Since then a further con-
tribution of $170,000 has been made,
bringing the total to $1,045,000. Though
this building, which is now under con-
struction, will house primarily Institute
activities, it will also serve for the train-
ing of scholars on the predoctoral and
postdoctoral levels.
Although the benefits which derive
from some of the above-mentioned con-
tributions and services cannot be meas-
ured in terms of dollars and cents, they
definitely have a share in making the Uni-
versity a better institution in terms of
faculty and research facilities.
The faculty enjoyed many benefits
from the research carried on through the
Institute. In the solicitation and accept-
ance of research contracts, the interests
of the members of the faculty have al-
ways been of primary concern. Sponsored
research offers faculty members an op-
portunity to do research along the line
of their specialties, which might not al-
ways be possible if they were dependent
on University funds for the purchase of
special equipment and research materials.
Though it is not universally true that it
takes a good research man to make a good
teacher, it may safely be said that a man's
value as a teacher usually increases in
direct proportion to the amount of re-
search he does. The high caliber of the
University faculty in the fields of engi-
neering and the physical sciences is prob-
ably due in some measure to the oppor-
tunities which the Institute offers the fac-
ulty for doing fundamental and develop-
mental research in their chosen fields.
It is not only the faculty members who
gain in stature through Institute research,
but many students as well. Students, both
undergraduate and graduate, derive dis-
tinct benefits from the added experience
and greater wisdom of their teachers as a
result of their research activities. Also,
many graduate students work on projects
in one capacity or another. By being in
direct contact with live problems and
learning research methods by working to-
ward desired solutions, they receive the
type of training that will make them more
valuable later on as teachers as well as re-
search workers. Also, many receive suffi-
cient income to enable them to continue
their training toward advanced degrees.
Frequently their doctoral dissertations are
a direct outgrowth of project research.
// we in this country are to maintain
our leadership in science and technology,
more and belter-trained research workers
and scientists must come out of our uni-
versities. The Engineering Research In-
stitute performs a noteworthy service to-
ward this end.
During the year 1951-52, research was
conducted on 239 projects. Of these, 73
were completed and 98 were initiated
during the year, which leaves a total of
166 active projects as of July 1, 1952.
The number of projects worked on
during the year exceeds the number re-
ported last year by 13 per cent, indicating
a greater variety of investigations. The
volume of research has risen from
$3,121,730 to $6,507,770, of which
$5,192,206 was for direct costs and
$1,315,564 for indirect costs. The total
amount of research represents an increase
of about 110 per cent and an increase of
well over 400 per cent of the figure re-
ported for 1945-46, the last war year.
While this growth is due in a very
large measure to increased sponsorship
of fundamental and applied research on
the part of the Federal Government, the
Director is pleased to report that indus-
try-sponsored research also shows some

increase. That it has not increased more
may be attributed to some extent to the
fact that production of civilian goods
requiring strategic materials has been
somewhat curtailed, but, perhaps, even
more to the lack of incentive on the part
of a manufacturer to sponsor research
when he knows that the Government is

During World War II it became neces-
sary to produce accurate castings of the
highmelting point alloys such as magne-
sium, aluminum, and copper free from
porosity and blow holes. Prior to this,
die casting machines were incapable of
handling these alloys. This was due to
the fact that the heat of the molten alloy
tended to dissolve the component parts of
the machine if left in contact any appre-
ciable amount of time. This both adul-
terated the alloys and reduced the accur-
acy of later castings.
The basic principles of the cold cham-
ber process are shown in the illustration.
In Figure A the die is closed, both cores
are in position, and the molten metal is
ladled into the plunger (injector) tube.
The plunger then forces the metal into
the die chamber (Figure B). Since the
chamber is cold relative to the molten
metal, the metal soon solidifies in the
form of the desired casting. The cores are
then withdrawn and one part of the die
recedes from the casting (Figure C).
The castings is held in place by the plung-
er and the ejector. The plunger is then
withdrawn and the ejector removes the
casting from the die (Figure D). The
entire apparatus is now returned to the
JOAN E. McDOUGALL, '56E

position in Figure A and the process is
repeated.
Although the illustration demonstrates
this process with a fairly simple casting
and basic parts, many intricate castings
are produced by complicated mechanics
that follow the same principles. A cold
chamber machine may have more cores
and ejectors. All dies also have shallow
vents on the die blocks to allow for air
escape.
The illustration does not show the sys-
tem by which the dies are locked. The
early machines did not hold the dies
close enough and it was found that a
great amount of metal was seeping be-
tween the die faces. This not only caused
metal waste but also produced an inaccur-
ate casting and sprung the dies. To pre-
vent this, modern machines are equipped
with hydraulic positive locks.
Two types of dies are used for small,
simple castings. The unit die is used for
varying quantities and production require-
ments. The combination die is utilized
for lowering production costs by the pro-
duction of more than one casting at a
time.
Most modern cold chamber die casting
machines are equipped for both manual
and semi-automatic operation. When used
semi-automatically, the operator ladles the
metal into the pouring slot in the plunger
tube and operates the plunger by means
of a foot switch. The remainder of the
process is carried on automatically. Ejec-
tion is also automatic in the manual ma-
chine but the preceding steps are con-
trolled by a system of push buttons.
To make and retain the high pressure
necessary to operate the plunger, an ac-
cumulator is usually used. This is situ-
ated on the right side of the machine.
The accumulator receives the oil from a
high pressure control valve that opens
only during the forward stroke of the
plunger. The oil is charged with nitrogen
gas, for air causes corrosion and in the
event of possible leakage might prove to
be dangerous because of its inflamma-
bility.
The cold chamber die casting process
revolutionized many industries with its
development. It allowed the manufacture
of intricate small pieces all in one process
with high alloy purity as well as the
manufacture of fairly large pieces. The
manufacturer found it less expensive in

Press for the use of the illustration

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


BY
EUGENE L. LEMANSKI
Eugene Lawrence Lemanski, a product of
the Detroit school system, attended Western
Michigan College, Colgate University, and
Wayne University before entering the
United States Navy. He was discharged in
December. 1947, with the rank of midship-
man. Lemansk! entered the University of
Michigan in 1948 as a mechanical engineer
and continued his studies here until June,
1950. He is now working for a manufactur-
ing firm in Detroit.
From the driver's standpoint a trans-
mission is something he uses when he
can't climb a hill in high gear. He also
finds a transmission handy for starting
the car from a standstill without stalling
the engine.
From the car's standpoint a transmis-
sion is a device that changes the speed
and torque ratio between engine and
wheels. At low car speeds it permits the
engine to run either fast or slow. With
the engine running fast, more power is
developed, thereby pushing the car up the
hill more easily, and permitting a quicker
pickup.
In the conventional transmission two
parallel shafts are used, each carrying
several gears. The gears are meshed to-
gether in one of four combinations to
give the desired ratios—three forward
and one reverse. In high gear the trans-
mission ratio is 1:1—the engine runs at
the same speed as the propeller shaft,
which in turn drives the rear axles and
the rear wheels. In second gear, the en-
gine runs about U/2 times as fast as the
propeller shaft, thereby producing ap-
proximately l]/2 times the power. In low
gear, the engine runs about 214 times as
fast as the shaft.
Another way of looking at the trans-
mission is to consider it as a device
that permits the same engine speed at
car speeds which are 1/3 or 3/5 slower
than in high gear.
In the usual transmission the three
speeds are controlled by a lever under
the steering wheel. After disconnecting
the drive from the engine by means of
foot-operated clutch, the driver uses the
lever to engage one of the three forward
speeds, or reverse, by shifting gears or
jaw clutches in the transmission.
Over a long period of years this com-
bination of a foot operated clutch and a
hand-operated three-speed transmission
has been found the simplest, least costly
and most reliable device for changing the
speed ratio between engine and propeller
shaft. However, each speed change re-
quires at least four separate and distinct
moves by the driver. Getting a car in
motion and rolling down the street in
high gear demands 15 operations, if all
three forward speeds are used. Much of
the tired feeling particularly after city
driving, comes from the muscular effort
required to operate the clutch pedal and
gearshift lever.
In the standard car with gearshift
transmission, a rear axle ratio is selected
to give the best compromise between
power and economy. Power for hill climb-
ing and acceleration is increased by use
of a high ratio axle, for instance, 4.5:1,
while fuel and oil economy, engine quiet-
ness and life are greater with a low ratio
axle, say 3.5:1. The average axle ratio
for American cars is about 4:1, that is,
with the transmission in high gear, the
engine turns four times for every revolu-
tion of the rear wheels.
A low ratio rear axle could be used if
the driver would shift into second when-
ever more power was needed for hill
climbing or acceleration. The American
driver, however, expects to do all normal
driving in high gear, and perhaps quite
justifiably, dislikes gear shifting to obtain
the car performance he demands. If an
automatic device is provided to shift to a
lower gear every time more power is
needed, a low ratio rear axle can be em-
ployed, thereby giving economy, quietness
and longer life for normal driving. A
connection to the accelerator pedal or in-
take manifold can be provided to indi-
cate when the shift should take place.
An automatic transmission is one
means of accomplishing this result.
Normally the axle ratio used with auto-
matic transmissions is lower by about
half a ratio than standard axles, so that
the engine turns only $y2 times for every
revolution of the rear wheels, instead of
four times. With the next to top gear in
the transmission giving a ratio of about
l\/2:1, the engine turns 3J/2 x l]/2 or
5)4 times as fast as the rear wheels,
thereby providing excellent acceleration
and hill climbing ability.
For normal driving the 3^:1 ratio in
top transmission gear gives improved
economy, reduced engine noise and long
life. If in a conventional car the engine
runs 3,000 revolutions per mile with a
4:1 axle, in an automatic transmission
equipped vehicle with 3^:1 axle the
engine speed is only 2,660 revolutions
per mile. Usually engine speeds with
automatic transmissions or overdrives are
even lower than this, averaging about
2,400 revolutions per mile.
In some of the newer automatic trans-
mission installations, the axle ratio is
made even lower to further increase oper-
ating economy by reducing engine speeds.
One such installation uses a 3:1 axle
ratio.
An overdrive gives about the same
effect as an automatic transmission in re-
ducing engine speeds and improving fuel
economy. In overdrive both the engine
and the gearshift transmission are slowed
down relative to the propeller shaft and
rear axle to give about the same engine-
to-rear wheel speed ratio as with an auto-
matic transmission in top gear.
Overdrives have been used for many
years. While they can be, and usually
are, provided with automatic control to
permit quick shifting between the two
top ratios, they do not provide for auto-
matic shifting while starting from a
standstill. The automatic transmission
does both.
An automatic transmission that does
not take advantage of a reduced axle
ratio, or its equivalent, loses most of its
possibilities. The reduced engine speed
permits a major savings in gasoline and
oil consumption and engine maintenance
that during the life of the car may be
greater than the extra cost of the trans-
mission.
If by the use of an automatic trans-
mission the fuel economy can be in-
creased from 15 to 16 miles per gallon,
208 gallons will be saved during 50,000
miles of operation. At 25 cents per gal-
lon this will amount to $52. If the trans-
mission permits an increase of two miles
per gallon, 392 fewer gallons will be
used, saving $98. Three miles per gallon
increase is equivalent to 555 gallons, or
Si39. In addition to the gasoline saving,
the reduced engine speeds achieve a

ENGINEERING
With the rapid development of new
and better materials to meet the demands
of industry and of government agencies,
there has arisen a need for engineers with
a sound understanding of materials and
the factors which determine or control
their properties. The requirements being
made on materials have outstripped the
capabilities of existing products to fulfill
them. Today, higher temperatures and
pressures are being used; the environ-
ments are, therefore, more corrosive. In
the development of power from nuclear
energy, the bottleneck to progress has
frequently been the lack of suitable ma-
terials capable of withstanding radiation.
At the same time the needs of defense
have removed large fractions of the nor-
mal supply of nickel, cobalt, molyb-
denum, copper, and even steel from civil-
ian use. Suitable substitutes must be
found. Germany's experience after the
First World War was that many of the
substitute or "ersatz" products were as
good as or better than the original and so
remained in use. It is likely that in our
country the development of new engi-
neering materials will increase in the next
decade.
The curriculum in Materials Engineer-
ing is directed to filling the need for
men to work in this field. The student
must have a sound foundation in engi-
neering, chemistry and physics. The fields
covered in his courses will include metals
and alloys, cements, ceramic materials,
plastics, rubbers, and protective coatings.
Two new courses have been developed,
one of which is being taught this semes-
ter; this is Chemical and Metallurgical
Engineering 126. The description reads
as follows:
The course consists of lectures on the struc-
ture and properties of glasses and ceramics as
related to composition and thermal treatment.
Attention is given to the methods and results
of physical study of such properties as chemi-
cal durability, viscosity, annealing, heat capac-
ity, heat conductivity, density, thermal expan-
sion, elastic properties, strength, thermal en-
durance, hardness, optical properties, electrical
conductivity, dielectric properties and mag-
netic properties, as well as presenting the basic
theories for the behavior of these properties
with time, temperature, and composition.
The other new course is Chemical and
BY
DR. RICHARD SCHNEIDEWIND
Metallurgical Engineering 125 which will
probably be offered in the fall. This will
cover the basic reactions in the polymeri-
zation of the plastic and rubber com-
pounds and in the control of properties
of these materials. The specific properties
and utility of the various compounds will
be discussed.
The Materials Engineering Program
can lead to graduate courses and research
in any of the following fields:
1. Metallurgy.
2. High Polymers—plastic, rubber, ad-
hesives, etc.
3. Ceramics—glass, refractories, etc.
4. Organic Protective Coatings—lac-
quer, enamel, paint, etc.
The employment opportunities lie in
the following directions.
1. Materials Specification. The men
are particularly valuable in manufactur-
ing plants where it is desirable to replace
present materials for the purpose of im-
proving the product, reducing costs, re-
ducing service failures, due to shortages
of specific raw materials, or due to in-
creased demands made on the product.
2. Product Improvement. Materials
engineers find opportunities in selection
and control of surface finishes used on
products to increase sales appeal and to
reduce deterioration from heat or corro-
sion.
3. Product Development. Industry is
employing many men who have the train-
ing and ingenuity to develop new and
useful products to be made of the ma-
terial his organization is manufacturing.
4. Engineering Sales. If the man has a
suitable temperament and personality, en-
gineering sales may be a profitable field
for him.
How's Your Speed?
It may take you 180,000 times longer
to solve a relatively simple arithmetic
problem than it does General Electrics
new electronic computer.
That's the result of a small contest held
here in which half-a-dozen intelligent
adults pitted their multiplication skills
against "OARAC", the computer which
the G-E Electronics Division will deliver
soon to the U. S. Air Force's Research and
Development Command.
OARAC can multiply 8,645,392,175
by 8,645,392,175 in about four one-
thousandths of a second. The answer
comes out in quintillions.
An accountant, accustomed to working
with numbers, multiplied the figures in
four and one-half minutes, the fastest
time.
A secretary and a writer took time out
from their typing to vie for the slowest
time, 12 minutes.
A housewife set aside the vacuum
cleaner to make the more than 200 multi-
plication and addition steps in nine min-
utes.
The engineer responsible for the de-
sign of OARAC did it in five minutes.
A trained mathematician got his answer
in six minutes.
None of their answers coincided. None
of them got the right answer—which is
74,742,805,859,551,230,625, in case you
have a pencil and a watch handy.
Reinforced Plastics Competing
With Wood, Steel and Aluminum
Reinforced plastics are fast becoming
competitors of steel, aluminum and wood
and may well turn out to be the most im-
portant new structural materials develop-
ed during the past decade.
The Armed Forces are buying sub-
stantial amounts for more than 125 uses.
For reinforced plastic pipe alone, they're
expected to use 10 million pounds of
plastic a year.
The Navy is ordering use of some plas-
tics regardless of the availability of steel,
copper and other metals and does not
consider them substitutes.
To make these plastics, reinforcing ma-
terials such as fibrous glass, cotton, rayon,
nylon and paper are embedded in plastic
resin, which is then molded to shape and
allowed to harden.
This combination of plastic and re-
inforcement makes a versatile structural
material. The plastic is weather-resistant,
easily colored and molded. The reinforce-
ment adds strength, toughness and dimen-
sional stability.

Promise of a golden future
Yellow uranium ore from the Colorado Plateau
is helping to bring atomic wonders to you
Long ago, Indian braves made their war paint from the col-
orful sandstones of the Colorado Plateau.
THEY USED URANIUM-Their brilliant yellows came from
carnotite, the important uranium-bearing mineral. Early in
this century, this ore supplied radium for the famous scien-
tists, Marie and Pierre Curie, and later vanadium for spe-
cial alloys and steels.
Today, this Plateau —stretching over parts of Colorado,
Utah, New Mexico, and Arizona — is our chief domestic
source of uranium. Here, new communities thrive; jeeps
and airplanes replace the burro; Geiger counters supplant
the divining rod and miner's hunch.
From hundreds of mines that arc often just small tunnels
in the hills, carnotite is hauled to processing mills. After the
vanadium is extracted, the uranium, concentrated in the
form of "yellow-cake," is shipped to atomic energy plants.
A NEW ERA BECKONS—What does atomic energy prom-
ise for you? Already radioactive isotopes are working won-
ders in medicine, industry, and agriculture. In atomic en-
ergy, scientists also see a vision of unknown power—which
someday may heat and light your home, and propel sub-
marines, ships, and aircraft. The Indian's war paint is on
the march again—toward a golden future.
UCC TAKES AN IMPORTANT PART-The people of Union
Carbide locate, mine, and refine uranium ore. They also
operate for the Government the huge atomic materials plants
at Oak Ridge, Tenn., and Paducah, Ky., and the Oak Ridge
National Laboratory, where radioisotopes are made.

Nickel-Clad Steel
Nickel-clad steel plate consists of open
hearth steel with a layer of nickel on one
or both sides. It is made by pressure
welding, in a rolling mill, of the nickel
cladding material and the steel slab at a
temperature of about 2,200° Fahrenheit.
The resultant material combines the cor-
rosion resistance of nickel with the me-
chanical properties, heat conductivity and
thermal expansion of steel. Nickel-clad
steel is used where solid nickel is not re-
quired, such as in tank cars, water storage
tanks, soap kettles and dye tanks. These
steels are also being used to replace pure
nickel in many other applications.
"Malted Milk" Fan
A novel 20-ton fan, shaped like a huge
malted milk container, has been installed
by International Nickel to ventilate the
underground workings of the new caving
project at its Creighton Mine in the Sud-
bury District of Northern Ontario. This
single fan, 42 feet high and the only one
of its type in Canada, furnishes fresh air
from the surface at a rate of 300,000
cubic feet per minute. In a "merry-go-
round" operation, it draws air directly
through the caved or broken ore, circu-
lates it in the underground workings, and
carries it back to the surface.

into what probably will be North Dakota's largest industry. A
new Standard Oil refinery, with equipment similar to that shown,
is scheduled to be operating at this Mandan site before the end
of 1954. Capable of refining 30,000 barrels a day, it will pro-
vide the first major outlet for the Williston Basin production.

OIL is making a prairie plant grow!
Before the close of
1954, a new Standard Oil
refinery is scheduled to
be operating at Mandan,
North Dakota.
Behind this lies a story
of Standard Oil's willingness to back its
scientists' j udgment with millions of dollars.
Two years ago oil was discovered in the
Williston Basin. How much oil this basin
eventually will produce is anybody's guess,
but the current rate is only about 10,000
barrels a day. However, geologists, geo-
physicists and engineers, working in field
and laboratory, have estimated that the
basin holds a total of two and a half bil-
lion barrels.
On the basis of this estimate, Standard
Oil has let a contract for the construction
of a new refinery at Mandan and a 215-
mile products pipeline from Mandan to
Moorhead, Minnesota. A crude oil pipe-
line of 170 miles will be completed by the
time the refinery is ready for operation
and a pipeline gathering system of about
40 miles already has been built.
Construction activities such as these
and the tireless search for oil are jobs that
never end in the petroleum industry.
Young technical men at Standard Oil
have found that there still are many ex-
citing frontiers to explore with a company
that is constantly building, constantly
looking to the future.

to bring the bow toward the dock. Two
lines are attached to the stern, one on
each side, which serve to bring the boat
back flush against the apron. In the mean-
time, two more deckhands operate a crank

A description of docking might be of
interest. The boat comes into the harbor
and proceeds to turn around by means of
its twin screws operating in opposite di-
rections with the anchor down. A line is
carried by the deck hands to the stern, and
they jump to the dock as soon as possible
to tie the line at a point opposite the
which positions the apron to approxi-
mately the same height as the boat. The
clamps are then inserted, and the boat
and apron are an integral unit. Under
normal conditions the whole operation
moves forward without a hitch, quickly
and efficiently.
The capacity of the boats varies from
24 freight cars, which can be carried by
No. 3, to 32 freight cars, which the
Wabash can carry. In 1950, as was previ-
ously stated, the total number of cars
transported for the five boats was
91,943.
The boats usually average better than
800 trips a year across the lake. Last year
the No. 7 set a new record with 936
crossings, or better than 2y2 per day.
No figures are available on the cost
of the crew, but a good estimate could be
approximately $250,000 a year per boat.
Depreciation costs are also hard to calcu-
late because of lack of data on original
costs. But, if a replacement cost of
$2,000,000 is depreciated over a period
of 50 years, a figure of $40,000 results.
(This figure was chosen because that was
the cost of the new car ferry purchased by
the State of Michigan recently.) Repair
costs on the five boats for 1950 amounted
to $294,733.13- Fuel cost amounts to
approximately $76,300 a year per boat.
Total costs are as follows:
Fuel, $76,300 x 5 $ 381,000
Repairs 294,773
Crew, $40,000 x 5 1,250,000
Depreciation, $40,000 x 5 200,000
Total $2,225,773
Pro-rated over the 91,943 cars carried,
this would amount to $24 plus per car.
However, the passengers carried reduce
this amount by a considerable percentage.

with loathing. All it had brought him was
unhappiness and sorrow, but that was
over. He was back to his first love—the
earth. For a while he was motionless in
silent contemplation; a prayer of thanks-
giving rose from his heart. Once more
he was part of nature and not just a
shadow in the city. A voice called, "Din-

engaged in similar research and that the
results thereof may eventually benefit
production in his own plant.
In this connection it is interesting to
note that research costing over three quar-
ters of a million dollars was done in divi-
sions of the University other than the
Engineering College and the Willow Run
Research Center. The most notable in-
creases outside of engineering depart-
ments were those in the Departments of
Chemistry and Physics.
It would indeed be rash to state that
the University has received an exceptional
share of Government research funds.
Nevertheless, it should be pointed out
that the Government agencies would not
contract for more and more Institute re-
search if they had not been pleased with
the research reults of previous years.
That the results have been satisfactory is
attributable to the University's up-to-date
laboratory facilities, to the large number
of highly trained specialists in the fields
of engineering and the physical sciences
who either carry on project research them-
selves or supervise the work of others,
and to the administration of research
projects on the part of the Institute and
the University.
It would serve no useful purpose to
distinguish between Government-sponsor-
ed research and that done for industrial
interests. Much of the former type of
work is classified and therefore can be
mentioned only in very general terms.
Consequently, it must suffice to enumer-
ate simply the outstanding fields of in-
vestigation in which research was car-
ried on:
Cosmis Rays—Investigations deep below
ground level and at elevations up to
15,000 feet.
Nuclei Energy Levels—A study of beta

Basic research and engineering advances make RCA
Victor's 1953 TV receivers the finest you can buy.
irst with the major advances
since Television began!
Families living in television areas
have seen from the beginning why
more people buy RCA Victor tele-
vision sets than any other brand. As
television spreads to new communi-
ties, millions more learn the same.
Enthusiastic reception of the 1953
RCA Victor sets proves that advanced re-
search and engineering means finer TV.
You see it in the new"Magic Monitor" cir-
cuit system which automatically screens
out interference, steps up power, tunes
the best sound to the clearest picture.
Further proof of this leadership is the
new RCA "Deep Image" picture tube with
its micro-sharp electron beam and superfine
phosphor screen which ensures the finest
picture quality. It is also seen in reception
at a distance—as well as in automatic tuning
of all channels, both VHF and UHF.
Today's RCA Victor receivers result
from the same research and engineering
leadership that perfected the kinescope
picture tube, the image orthicon TV
cameras, reflection-free metal-shell
picture tubes — and which opened
UHF to television service.
RCA research assures tjou better value-
more for each dollar you invest—in any
product or service of RCA and RCA Victor.

National Defense Problems—Classified

It is apparent that a wide variety of fields,
such as is represented in the above list,
could be investigated only by a research
organization within a university having
faculty personnel with the essential spec-
ialized abilities.
The Signal Corps and the Air Force
are the sponsors who have made available
the greatest sums for research. Quite a
large portion of the work for the Air
Force is carried on at the Willow Run
Research Center.
However, not all the investigations
carried on for Government agencies have
a direct bearing on the defense effort.
For example, a sum of $125,000 was ex-
pended during the past year by the
Atomic Energy Commission for the study
of industrial uses of fission by-products,
and some significant results have already
been published, specifically concerning
the preservation of foods by gamma irra-
diation.
Also, the Office of Naval Research has
made available considerable sums for in-
vestigations in pure mathematics, of
which a large number have been accepted
by the Graduate School in partial fulfill-
ment of the requirements for the doctoral
degree.
Every sponsor of research receives cer-
tain reports, such as monthly progress re-
ports, quarterly reports, technical reports,
and a final report. The last type of report
is always submitted, for it describes the
results of the investigation and the proce-
dures employed and frequently contains
certain recommendations.
Many of the reports are illustrated with

both half-tones and line drawings, for
example, charts, graphs, and schematic
drawings. Depending on the length of
the report and the number of copies re-
quired, some are multigraphed and some
are lithoprinted.

cumulated through research done for the

both for the study of nuclear structure
and the production of radioactive iso-
topes.
growth of project research were publish-
ed in various scientific and technical jour-
nals and in society publications.
Whenever the results of research are
worthwhile scholarly contributions, they
may be published, with Institute funds,
either as an Engineering Research Insti-
tute numbered bulletin or a special publi-
cation. Three hundred copies of each
numbered bulletin are distributed by the
University General Library under an ex-
change arrangement through which the
University receives publications of simi-
lar value from American and foreign re-
search institutions. The Institute's own
series of publications during the past
year have begun to carry the additional
imprint of the University of Michigan
Press.
During 1951-1952 the Director of the
Engineering Research Institute, as in the
past, has profited from the deliberations
and advice of the Engineering Research
Council, whose chairman is Dr. George
Granger Brown, Dean of the College of
Engineering.
The Assistant Director, Professor
Charles W. Good, resigned September 15,
1951, to devote full time to teaching in
the Department of Mechanical Engineer-
ing. He had been associated with the In-
stitute since 1928, as part-time Assistant
to the Director until 1935, and since then
as Assistant Director (half-time). One of
his duties was to assist in the procurement
of sponsored research. He was also re-
sponsible for instituting certain project
control procedures to facilitate close su-
pervision of all the projects for which the
Institute is responsible, thus assuring the
sponsors that their funds are administered
in a business-like manner.
On October 1, 1951, Mr. Arthur C.
Prine was appointed Director of Develop-
ment, his duties being to assist the Direc-
tor in the procurement of research con-
tracts from Government and industry. Mr.
Prine terminated his connection with the
Institute at the end of the fiscal year.
Dr. Russell D. O'Neal, Director of the
Willow Run Research Center, resigned on
March 1, 1952, to accept employment in
private industry. He was succeeded by
Mr. Harry H. Goode, who by virtue of his
previous experience (Tufts College, 1943-
46; Head of the Special Projects Branch,
Office of Naval Research, Sands Point,
L.I., 1946-49; and Research Engineer,
Willow Run Research Center, 1950-52)
is well qualified to serve as Director of
the Center.
To carry on the research activities of
the Institute, a large staff is required. The
monthly average was 960, varying from
774 in July, 1951, to 1,116 in May, 1952.

about dicker die steel
what it is
Clicker die steel is a special cold rolled alloy steel. It is used
in making clicker dies for cutting leather, rubber, plastic,
felt and fabrics of other compositions that
^- go into the making of shoes
and similar products.

how it is used
Clicker die steel is furnished to the die maker in either
single or double edged form in one of several standard
shapes. The die maker first shapes the die by bending
the die steel to a pattern that provides the desired con-
figuration, and then welds the two ends at a corner. He
finishes the die by grinding a bevel on the outside of the
cutting edge and filing the inside edge. Before the fin-
ished die is hardened and tempered, the die maker
forms identification marks — combinations of circles
and squares — in the cutting edge so that the material
cut from it may be easily identified as to its size and
style.
In the cutting operation, the leather or other material
is placed on an oak block in the bed of the clicker
machine. Then the die is placed by hand on the material
which is cut as the aluminum faced head of the machine
presses the die through it. The clicking sound which
the head makes as it strikes the die is where the term
"clicker machine" derived its name.
what it is composed of
Clicker die steel as produced by the Crucible Steel
Company of America is a controlled electric steel in
which the combination of carbon and alloy is designed
for maximum toughness and proper hardness after heat
treatment.
Experience has proved that cold finished clicker die
steel is superior to hot rolled material for sizes ap-
proximately % inch and narrower because of its lower
degree of surface decarburization which permits the
use of slightly thinner sections. Cold finished material
also has a better surface finish with closer width and
thickness tolerances and thinner edges that require
less grinding and filing to complete the die.

The first submarine installation of a pipe-type
CaOie SySlffffl was recently installed under the Hudson River
at Poughkecpsie, N.Y Three cables, each nearly %-miles long,
were simultaneously pulled into a six-inch welded steel pipe laid
across the river bottom. The pipe was then filled with oil main-
tained at 200 lbs. pressure, enabling a 110,000-volt power circuit
to cross the river safely.
This kind of system is called Oilostatic — a design which has long
been first choice among utilities for handling large blocks of power
by means of a high-pressure pipe-type cable system. Increased cir-
cuit reliability and savings on installation and maintenance costs
are realized.
Oilostatic's new role as a submarine cable is typical of the sig-

Is part of your future being built here?
Here you see the beginning of another addition
to Alcoa's expanding facilities. This plant, at
Rockdale, Texas, will be the first in the world
to use power generated from lignite fuel and
will produce 170 million pounds of aluminum a
year. This and other new plants bring Alcoa's
production capacity to a billion pounds of
aluminum a year, four times as much as we
produced in 1939. And still the demand for
aluminum products continues to grow. Con-
sider the opportunities for you if you choose
to grow with us.
What can this mean as a career for you?
This is a production chart—shows the millions
of pounds of aluminum produced by Alcoa
each year between 1935 and 1951. Good men
did good work to create this record.
You can work with these same men,
learn from them and qualify yourself
for continually developing oppor-
tunities. And that production curve
is still rising, we're still expanding,
and opportunities for young men
joining us now are almost limitless.
Ever-expanding Alcoa needs engi-
neers, metallurgists, and technically
minded "laymen" for production,
research and sales positions. If you
graduate soon, if you want to be
with a dynamic company that's
"going places," get in touch with us.
Benefits are many; stability is a
matter of proud record; opportuni-
ties are unlimited.

marked decrease of oil consumption. Also
the reduced engine speeds lengthen life
of both engine and drive line parts, but
this saving is difficult to evaluate on a
dollars and cents basis.
Perhaps it would be best to briefly de-
scribe the two basic types of hydraulic
transmissions. The hydrostatic transmis-
sion employs positive displacement pumps
and motors of either the gear, piston, or
vane types to circulate the oil in the
system. The power is transmitted by caus-
ing a pressure rise in the pump and a
pressure drop in the hydraulic motor.
Since the oil returns to the pump with
the same velocity with which it left, there
is no kinetic energy transfer, so the sys-
tem is called "hydrostatic."
However, in the hydrokinetic trans-
mission, the energy transfer is accomplish-
ed through changes in the velocity of the
oil as it passes through the pump and
turbine, pressure changes being avoided
as far as possible. The hydrokinetic trans-
mission is usually composed of a centri-
fugal pump and a hydraulic reaction tur-
bine mounted co-axially in the same case,
which is filled with oil. Without a reac-
tion stage, the transmission becomes a
fluid clutch, such as used in the Chrysler
Fluid Drive, or in General Motor's
Hydramatic.
Unfortunately, neither type of hydrau-
lic transmission is easy to develop into
a finished product. The hydrostatic trans-
mission, while it is easy to calculate its
performance characteristics, presents me-
chanical difficulties—high thrust and
radial loads on its bearings, high stresses
in some of its other parts, the necessity
for extreme accuracy in machining, and
sometimes, difficult sealing problems.
But the hydrodynamic transmission while
it has practically no bearing loads or
high stresses to contend with, essentially
nothing to wear out and very little ma-
chining in it, its performance is quite diffi-
cult to calculate, and the number of
compromises that must be made in order
to achieve the optimum performance in
each installation is staggering. Actually,
the hydrostatic transmissions are develop-
ed in the experimental laboratory after
they are designed and built, but the most
difficult part of the development of a
hydrodynamic transmission comes before
it ever gets to a drawing board for the
design of the actual parts. After the
transmission is built, a test stand will
just tell you that something is wrong,
not what is wrong. With the hydrostatic
transmission, a part will at least wear out
or break, and you can go to work on that.
But a torque converter will just sit there
and keep on running. Its efficiency may
be poor, but it won't tell you why. The
engineer must take his choice of wading
through weeks of tedious calculations, or
subjecting his company to months of ex-
pensive cut-and-try procedure.
According to the history books, the first
hydrokinetic transmissions or hydraulic
torque converters were designed as re-
duction gears between steam turbines and
propellers for shops before the develop-
ment of herringbone gears for the pur-
pose. Apparently, there was little inten-
tion of using the hydrokinetic transmis-
sion for an infinitely variable speed re-
ducer, as it is used today. But, in the past
fifty years, the transmissions have changed
considerably. A great deal of progress has
been made in understanding the internal
functioning of the converter—that is,
finding out what happens to streams of
oil flowing through stages of blades at 60
or 70 miles per hour.
The hydraulic torque converter by it-
self, is usually insufficient to perform
most transmission jobs, and must have
additional equipment combined with it,
such as provisions for neutral and reverse,
lock-up drive, auxiliary gear changes,

1 he ring test, shown above, is a scientific
method for determining the modulus of rupture
of pipe. It is not a required acceptance test but one
of the additional tests made by cast iron pipe manu-
facturers to ensure that the quality of the pipe
meets or exceeds standard specifications.
A ring, cut from random pipe, is subjected to
progressively increased crushing load until failure
occurs. Standard 6-inch cast iron pipe, for example,
withstands a crushing weight of more than 14,000
lbs. per foot. Such pipe meets severe service re-
quirements with an ample margin of safety.
Scientific progress in the laboratories of our
members has resulted in higher attainable stand-
ards of quality in the production processes. By
metallurgical controls and tests of materials, cast
iron pipe is produced today with precise knowl-
edge of the physical characteristics of the iron
before it is poured into the mold. Constant control
of cupola operation is maintained by metal analy-
sis. Rigid tests of the finished product, both ac-
ceptance tests and routine tests, complete the
quality control cycle. But with all the remarkable
improvements in cast iron pipe production, we do
not forget the achievements of the early pipe

Once upon a time a large business firm
planned to open a new branch in a cer-
tain city, and so they advertised positions
for three new clerks. Out of a number of
applicants the personnel manager selected
three promising young men and address-
ed them in the following way: "Your sal-
aries are to begin at the rate of $4000 per
year, to be paid every half-year. If your
work is satisfactory, and we keep you,
your salaries will be raised. Which would
you prefer, a raise of $150 per year or
a raise of $50 every half-year?" The first
two of the three applicants eagerly ac-
cepted the first alternative, but the third
young man (a Michigan graduate), after
a moment's reflection, took the second.
He was promptly put in charge of the
other two. Why?

H. A. Merrill in Mathematical Excur-
sions has collected several rather unique
methods for remembering the value of pi.
To remember four places you merely
mumble to yourself "Yes, I have a num-
ber." This expression has the number
of letters in the successive words—3, 1,
4, 1, 6,—to give the digits for pi.
To remember twelve places we are told
to say to ourselves the following:
"See, I have a rhyme assisting
My feeble brain, its tasks ofttimes re-
sisting." .
And to remember to thirty place we re-
peat the French verse:
"Que j'aime a faire apprendre un nom-
bre utile aux sages!
Immortel Archimede, sublime in-
genieur,
Qui de ton jugement peut sonder la
valeur?
Pour noi ton probleme eut de pareils
avantages."
Such verses must be considered the
ultimate in functional art.
One Memorial Day the boys and girls
in all the schools of a certain town were
invited to march in a patriotic parade.
Each school was told to form its pupils in
a column, with the same number in each
row. In each school the number of pupils
was less than 1000, and no two had the
same number enrolled. Three schools
had the following experience when the
pupils were formed in a column: First,
they were arranged by twos, and there was
one left over; then by threes, and there
were two left over; then by fours, and
there were three left over; then by fives,
and there were four left over; then by
sixes, and there were five left over; but
finally they were arranged by sevens, it
came out exactly right.
In the other schools, when the pupils
were arranged two in a row, three in a
row, etc. up through six in a row, there
was one left over each time, but, as before
when seven were put in each row, none
were left over. How many schools were
there, and how many pupils in each
school?

While thumbing through an Ancient
Greek Manuscript the other day I stumbl-
ed upon a problem put to one Polycrates
by Pythagoras (of Pythagorian theorem
fame) and it went thusly:
Polycrates speaks: Blessed Pythagoras,
Helicenian scion of the Muses, answer my
question: How many in thy house are en-
gaged in the contest for wisdom perform-
ing excellently?
Pythagoras answers: I will tell thee
then, Polycrates. Half of them are occu-
pied with belles lettres; a quarter apply
themselves to studying immortal nature;
a seventh are all intent on silence and the
eternal discourse of their hearts, (authors
note: these last were probably chess play-
ers.) There are also three women, among
whom the superior is Theano. That is the
number of interpreters of the Muses I
gather round me.
How many were there?
Squire Tompkins is known as the
sharpest bargainer and hardest shopper in
town. The other day he tried his stuff on
the new clerk in the hardware store.
"How long is this fire extinguisher
guaranteed?" he asked.
"Firty years," was the quick reply.
"Can't use it," said the old squire.
"I'll not live that long."
"But you can take it with you when
you go," replied the resourceful clerk.

AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSIONS
(Continued from page 46)
etc. Transmissions embodying torque converters differ as much
in the auxiliary equipment as they do in the converter itself,
and the selection of this equipment by various manufacturers
shows several different philosophies concerning the use of the
converter.
While all of the well-known hydraulic torque converters
have been built for torque multiplication, at least one, which is
now in the development stage, was designed for a speed
multiplication. This transmission, designed to drive a super-
charger, while its first test runs have not been too successful
due to its poor efficiency in the low speed ratios and its in-
ability to accelerate the load into the high efficiency range, may
be interesting from the academic standpoint. It has been
proven that good efficiencies can be achieved at step-up
ratios as high as 5 or 6 to 1.
One of the widely publicized features of the Tucker rear-
engine car was its torque converter drive. The engine is
mounted transversely, with the crankshaft where the rear axle
would be, with a hydrodynamic transmission driving each rear
wheel independently. To use two transmissions in one automo-
bile might sound expensive. However, cost analyses have
shown this to be cheaper than a semi-automatic gear-type and
differential. The added traction provided by the independent
drive is an extra advantage. The requirements for this trans-
mission were about as tough as any ever seen: for ground
clearance, the diameter could be no greater than 15 inches, in
spite of an input torque of 225 foot-pounds at 1000 rpm,
torque multiplication of 4.7, and a universal joint just 5
inches from the end of the crankcase!
There are no gears between the crankshaft and the wheels,
not even for reverse. The pump of the converter has constant
torque characteristics, to hold the engine close to its full-
throtte capacity at all speeds, and the turbine and stator sec-
tions have been designed in such a way as to give high effi-
ciency over a broad enough range to allow the drive to be
through the converter at all times.
For years, it has seemed that far too much attention has
been given to high compression ratios and high octane gaso-
line, and far too little atention to the transmission. The trans-
mission is highly efficient in itself with respect to the ratio
of output power to input power, but it renders our engine
efficiency achievements ineffective by letting the engine run
away, as much as half its power going to pump air through
a throttle valve, and drive all its parts at twice the necessary
speed.
The popular belief that a car with a powerful engine must
make poor gas mileage is not necessarily so. Specific fuel con-
sumption is generally just a little better with large engines
than it is with small ones. It's a miscarriage of justice to con-
demn the engine for crimes of a "make-shift" transmission. A
Cadillac can be operated at 35 miles per gallon at 35 miles
per hour, by slightly leaning-out the carburetor, and installing
the right transmission. It doesn't have to be over 90 percent
efficient, either.

Synthane's combination of
properties can often make

Without oil there'd be no automobiles or
airplanes, fewer plastics, soaps, drugs,
floor polishes, cosmetics, insecticides.
In one form or another, petroleum and
petrochemicals are almost as important
to us as the air we breathe. And in one
way or another, Synthane plastic lami-
nates are equally important to petroleum
production and processing.
The reason is understandable.
Synthane is a dependable material with
many uses.
Because it is wear-resistant and tough,
yet easy to machine, Synthane is used
for components of oil well cementing
equipment. Because Synthane is strong
and corrosion-resistant, it is excellent for
pump valves, piston rings, and compressor
plates in tank-farms and refineries. Be-
cause it is a good insulator, Synthane in
the form of flange insulation provides
cathodic protection for pipe lines. Be-
cause it is a good moisture-resisting die-
lectric, light weight Synthane is used in
geophysical survey equipment and oil-
locating instruments. VVear-and-corrosion
resistance make Synthane desirable for
flow-line valve-seat inserts.
Because of all these valuable proper-
ties, plus many more, Synthane may be a
material you can put to profitable use.

Roughly, about one third were part-time
employees, including 170 faculty men,
who supervised or assisted in research
projects.
The personnel categories are: adminis-
trative, faculty, academic appointees on
projects (many of these have their Ph.D.
degrees, and others are working toward
the doctorate), personnel-office ap-
pointees on projects (mainly technicians),
hourly assistants on projects (virtually
all graduate students), and office staff.
In his last annual report the Director
predicted a substantial increase in spon-
sored research on the basis of payroll fig-
ures for the first three months of the new
fiscal year. Using corresponding figures
for the present year, the total costs for
1952-53 will probably be close to
$9,000,000, and it seems that these costs
will continue to increase for some years to
come, though presumably at a less ac-
celerated pace.
If the Federal Government should
make cutbacks in the expenditures for na-
tional defense, in the event of a change
in world-wide political conditions, spon-
sored nongovernmental research will
probably begin to increase more rapidly
than it has in recent years. Besides, there
are distinct indications that industry,
which has profited most from the results
of research carried on at universities and
from their output of research personnel,
will support more and more research of
both a fundamental and an applied na-
ture.
It is anticipated, moreover, that funds
for the support of research will be made
available by an increasing number of
foundations, trade associations, and indi-
viduals, as well as certain Government
agencies such as the Office of Naval Re-
search, the Atomic Energy Commission,
and the National Science Foundation.
In view of this continued growth, ad-
ditional space will be required for the
Institute's activities. As far as laboratory
space is concerned, it appears that the im-
mediate needs will be met upon comple-
tion of the Cooley Memorial Building,
which is presently being erected on the
North Campus.
However, there is a dire need for a
new automotive laboratory, funds for
which have been requested from the State
Legislature. It is hoped, however, that
necessary modern equipment can be ob-
tained from various industries as gifts to
(Continued from page 58)
the University.
There is definite need for increased
space for service offices, such as account-
ing, payroll, reports, and reproduction, as
well as for administrative offices. These
functions should not be housed in the
Cooley Memorial Building; they must
remain on or adjacent to the Campus in
order to maintain the necessary close co-
operation between the Institute on the one
hand, and the University business offices
and the teaching and research staffs on the
other. The administrative offices must be
located on or reasonably close to the
Campus because of the necessary contacts
with the University administration and
the faculty as well as for the convenience
of many of the visitors to the University.

The old Professor at the college was
attending the unveiling of a bust of him-
self. After the ceremonies, a pretty young
lady walked up to him.

the four girls?" "Yes, Zcke." The fail-
ing patriach struggled to a sitting posi-
tion. "What's the big idea?" he shouted.
"Who's tending the store?"

three seats apart and in alternate rows."
The scene was the interior of a saloon
in the Far West, and around the table
were gathered as tough a gang as could

"Boys," he shouted, "this game ain't
straight. Sam ain't playing the hand I
dealt him."
The Mich. I.E. was discovered by his
wife one night standing over his baby's
crib. Silently she watched him. As he
stood looking down at the sleeping infant,
she saw in his face a mixture of emotions
that she had never seen before—rapture,
admiration, doubt, despair, ecstasy, in-
credulity. Touched and wondering alike
at his unusual parental attitude and the
conflicting emotions, his wife, with eyes
glistening, arose and slipped her arms
around him. "A penny for your
thoughts," she said in a tremulous voice.
He blurted them out: "For the life of
me, I can't see how in the hell anyone
can make a crib like that for three forty-
nine."

Laboratory here can grow a handsome
head of white "hair" or a beard on
"Aluminum Al," who is nothing more
than a sheet of pure aluminum cut out in
the shape of a man's head.
Actually, "Al's" hair is aluminum
oxide, which forms in a moist atmosphere
after the metal has been scratched while
held under mercury.
Amusing though he is, "Al's" purpose
is a serious one of helping provide a bet-
ter understanding of the most effective
way of using aluminum, which is replac-
ing copper in many critical applications.
Dr. Earl W. Balis, G-E research chem-
ist, explained that aluminum is very active
and could not be used were it not oblig-
ing enough to furnish its own protective
coating. This is a thin film of aluminum
oxide which forms immediately over a
freshly-cut surface exposed to air. The
film keeps air away and prevents further
oxidation.
"Al" demonstrates a condition under
which this does not occur. When the
aluminum surface is scratched under mer-
cury, the film does not form. Instead, the
oxide spouts out along the scratches in an
uncontrolled hairline growth.
Prof. J. H. Hildebrand, University of
California, is credited with the idea of
first trying the oxidation principle on a
cut-out head.
Ductile Iron Production Increased
It is estimated that the production of
Ductile Iron reached between 80,000 and
100,000 melt tons in 1952—an increase
of 50 to 100 per cent over 1951. This
new engineering material, which was de-
veloped at the Bayonne, N.J., Research
Laboratory of the International Nickel
Company and first commercially produced
in 1949, is a cast iron which will bend or
deform, under overloads, rather than fail-
ing in brittle fashion, as does ordinary
cast iron.

Higher and higher the speeds; greater and greater the stresses.
To match needs which are still beyond the horizon, the engineer is
increasingly urging the metallurgist to supply new materials.
The more efficient engines of today rely upon the use of temperature-

with still greater stresses and higher temperatures, must rely even more
upon Molybdenum.

air is used to cool the metal parts of the
combustion chamber and to provide suffi-
cient turbulence for complete combustion
of the fuel. The greatly expanded hot
combustion gases and the cooling air are
then mixed to prevent excessive tempera-
tures at the turbine and directed by the
turbine nozzles against the turbine blades.
The force of the gases against the blades
and the reactive force of the gases as
they leave the blades impart sufficient
torque for it to drive the air compressor
and the engine accessories. Unlike the
turbine of the turboprop engine, which
tries to extract almost all of the gas energy
for shaft torque, the turbojet is designed
to take just enough energy to do this
work and thereby allow the gases to re-
tain a maximum amount of energy for
conversion into jet thrust.
To give the engine thrust—by chang-
ing the momentum of the particles of air
passing through it—the gases are ejected
out the rear of the engine at great speed,
through an exhaust nozzle of relatively
small cross-sectional area. Some of the
(Continued from page 11)
larger turbojets currently undergoing de-
sign may eject from 100 to 400 tons of
air per hour at speeds of approximately
1200 to 1400 miles per hour.
As previously stated, the thrust of a
turbojet can be increased by redesigning
it either to handle a greater mass of air,
or to eject a given mass at a greater ve-
locity. To handle a greater mass of air,
the engine must have a larger effective
air inlet area. To increase the velocity of
the air being ejected, it is necessary either
to expand the gases more by adding more
heat, or to increase the pressure ratio of
the engine.
It is interesting to note all of the new,
more powerful turbojets are depending
mainly upon increased mass, rather than
increased jet velocities, to develop addi-
tional power. The reasons for this trend
are (1) the metals used in turbine nozzles
and blades cannot withstand the greatly
increased turbine temperatures that would
arise by adding more heat to gain greater
jet velocities, and (2) wake efficiency—
that percentage of the jet power that actu-

ally results in useful thrust power—in-
creases with increased mass, and de-
creases with increased jet velocities for a
given flight speed.
The fact that wake efficiency is propor-
tional to mass and inversely proportional
to the change in velocity of the fluid also
explains why a jet plane needs a longer
runway for take-off than a propeller-
driven plane of similar power.
Since the reciprocating engine propeller
handles a great mass of air and increases
its velocity only moderately, the propeller
has a high wake efficiency for take-off—
most of its thrust is useful thrust. Con-
versely, the turbojet engine handles a
relatively small amount of air and in-
creases its velocity tremendously, result-
ing in a low wake efficiency at take-off.
Therefore, in a test between a turbojet
plane and a reciprocating-engine-propel-
ler-driven plane of equal thrust, the low
wake efficiency of the turbojet plane
would result in its requiring more time
(or a longer run) before it could reach
flying speed. Actually, the turbojet does
not enjoy a wake efficiency of 50 percent
or more until the speed of the plane
equals or exceeds one-third the speed of
the jet thrust stream.
However, as the two planes gain alti-
tude and higher flight speeds, the wake
efficiency of the reciprocating engine pro-
peller tends to decrease, whereas the wake
efficiency of the turbojet engine increases.
As a result, the turbojet engine, besides
being much smaller and lighter, soon pro-
duces more useful thrust and becomes
the more efficient engine.
And as they say in Mechanics: "Every
couple has its moment."

The picture shows a group of students performing experiments in a typical senior communications labo-
ratory of the Electrical Engineering Department. The group in the foreground is checking the calibration
of a frequency meter, while another group is investigating transmission line properties at 200 megacycles
per second. The experiments are designed so that the students gain experience in the use of commercial
laboratory equipment, such as the frequency meter, while basic principles are emphasized whenever possi-
ble through the use of simpler, more easily visualized apparatus, such as the transmission line. Experiments
and classroom studies in the electronics-communications area range from the consideration of basic circuits,
electron motion and vacuum tube characteristics to studies on communications systems, microwave tubes and
the newly developed transistors and solid state devices. Emphasis is divided between basic principles and
the applications of these principles in modern equipment such as transmitters, receivers, control circuits,
computers and measuring instruments.
Microwave electronics has come widely into use by the large power systems like the Grand Coulee-
Bonneville plants for supervisory control, telemetering and communication. Sometimes these channels have
to operate under very severe conditions, as for example, the system of the Arizona Public Service Company,
which links the Phoenix steam plant and the Bell Switch and Litchfield substations. Ambient temperatures of
140 are not uncommon within buildings where the equipment operates so that a cooler is mounted on top of
the microwave cabinet. A dust filter is used to combat the serious conditions found in the desert and the
severe lighting conditions necessitate a ground rod and lightning arresters on top of the antenna masts

CULTURE IN THE ENGINEERING COLLEGE
The question of whether undergraduate' engineers
should be required to take courses aimed at providing
a broad cultural background is often discussed in pro-
fessional and academic groups. While it is unlikely
that such a program could be adopted in engineering
colleges which already have their curriculums filled
with the many technical subjects necessary for the
modern engineer, it is still of interest to discuss
whether such a program would be desirable.
In his daily work, the engineer does not need cul-
ture. This may seem obvious, but yet many other pro-
fessions do require a man of some culture. A lawyer
or a business man must at least seem to have some
understanding and appreciation when he is dealing
with his clients, but the engineer deals only with
facts, when he designs new structures. Yet it seems
to me that the engineer who for some reason is a bit
cultured leads a more successful and pleasant life.
Perhaps his understanding and refinement make it
possible for him to get along better with those around
him, including his business associates, his friends,
and family, and he is able to appreciate his surround-
ings more fully. For the engineer, culture is not a
means of livelihood, but something extra which will
enable him to lead a fuller life.
If we decide that culture is desirable, even for en-
gineers, the question then remains: Are required
college courses the best way to help engineers de-
velop culture? My answer is no. Compulsory study
of culture puts it on the same level as other required
subjects: just more material which must be studied
and then, if not used immediately, forgotten. The
idea of understanding and appreciation is lost in the
rush to get the required work done. Consider the re-
quired English courses. They do fill a need for train-
ing in precise composition and grammar, but the
significance of the literature studied is lost on many
students who are laboring under a heavy load of
studies. I don't mean to imply that cultural subjects
should not be offered to those who are interested.
If a student enters willingly into such a course, he
can gain as much as he wishes from it, and it can be
valuable to him.
How then can engineering students develop cul-
ture? One way is to join extra-curricular groups.
Musical organizations, publications, and discussion
clubs not only offer opportunities to participate in
interesting activities, but they also enable a student
to meet people with interests similar to his own. By
attending concerts, plays, and lectures, and reading
non-text book material in his own free time, a stu-
dent can broaden his interests and get an apprecia-
tion of the culture in the various fields. Progressing
in this natural manner makes that which is acquired
much more valuable to the individual than the forced,
artificial progress, and the culture finally developed
is one which a person can feel is his own, and not the
product of a college curriculum.

Tight reins in the stratosphere
For years the performance of bombers
and fighter planes at high altitudes has
been seriously handicapped by "mushy"
controls due to slackness in the cables.
That's because, when flying in the
earth's upper atmosphere where it's
sometimes as cold as minus 70°F., the
aluminum airframe contracts much
more than the carbon steel control
i-alilcs. To take up the slack, all sorts
of compensating devices were utilized.
They were expensive. Were costly to
maintain. They added cumbersome
weight. Created potential lags in con-
trol response.
Now this problem has been solved.
By the logical step of basically improv-
ing the control cable itself ... by de-
veloping a steel cable that would con-
tract and expand at practically the
same rate as the plane's aluminum
frame. It took fifteen years to do it but
it was worth the time and cost. We
called this improved cable, HYCO-
SPAN*.
HYCO-SPAN Aircraft Cable, with a
coefficient of expansion 50rJ higher
than high carbon steel, and 33% higher
than stainless steel, comes closest of any
steel cable to matching the expansion
and contraction of 24 ST aluminum
alloy air frames.
Even without temperature compen-
sating devices, HYCO-SPAN provides
positive, responsive control that won't
loosen or tighten up, that will remain
free of lag and mushiness, and that
prevents the development of plane flut-
ter—no matter what the altitude, no
matter how big the plane or at what
speed the plane is flying.
In addition, HYCO-SPAN Cable, be-
ing non-magnetic, has no effect on sen-
sitive airborne electronic equipment.
Having the corrosion resistance of stain-
less steel, HYCO-SPAN stands up well
in service in any climate. Its low coeffi-
cient of friction permits lower tension
loads and improves stability.
HYCO-SPAN Cable is another example
of the many interesting products developed
and produced by United States Steel. If
you're interested in becoming a part of a
progressive organization after graduation,
why not look into the opportunities with

No other company manufacturing aircraft and
plane components offers you the wide variety
of opportunity that exists at Goodyear Aircraft Cor-
poration—an important contributor to America's air
progress for more than forty years.
This is the company that pioneered in the use of
high-strength aluminum alloys in this country—and
leads today in light metals design and fabrication.
Goodyear pioneered with the first pneumatic air-
plane tire in 1910 — developed airplane wheels,
disc-type brakes, the Cross-Wind Landing Wheel
and other engineering advancements in plane
components.
In World War II, Goodyear Aircraft became one of
the nation's largest producers of aircraft—builders
of complete military planes and of components for
more than a dozen first-line ships. Today, too, GAC
is still active in this field.
In lighter-than-air, Goodyear Aircraft is the world's
largest builder of airships, including the new Navy
N-type—largest nonrigid airship ever built.
Long the leader in its field, Goodyear Aircraft is
once again vitally concerned with National Defense
projects. But we go far beyond anything of the past.
Today, our output includes complete airships as well
as many aircraft components. But we are also active
in many new fields—ranging from plastics fabrica-
tion and design to guided missiles and electronic
computers.
This wide variety of production, together with our
desire to build and maintain an outstanding engi-
neering staff makes Goodyear Aircraft a good place
to grow. You'll find unlimited opportunities for

In December, 1936, there was a meet-
ing of representatives of statewide or-
ganizations to plan co-ordinated action in
support of a proposed bridge across the
Straits of Mackinac. The bridge proposed
at this time would connect the Upper Pen-
insula of Michigan at the town of St.
lgnace with Mackinaw City in the lower
portion of Michigan at an estimated cost
of approximately $32,000,000. The con-
certed action inaugurated at this time was
based, to a certain extent, on the view-
point of Governor-Elect Murphy who was
in favor of the project. Then, too, rapidly
increasing traffic by way of the trunk
line ferries across the Straits was becom-
ing a potent force in favor of more ade-
quate transportation facilities. Because of
the rapidly increasing tourist industry, the
representatives of several chambers of
commerce and tourist organizations were
it the meeting and strongly backed Gov-
ernor Elect Murphy's viewpoint. Steps
were taken to have an appropriation made
by legislation to finance a survey to deter-
mine the feasibility of such a structure.
Since that meeting sixteen years ago,
many more such meetings have taken
place, many surveys have been made, and
several million dollars have been spent
in an attempt to determine whether the
proposed bridge might be safely built.
Finally, in January of 1951, a preliminary
report from the Mackinac Bridge Author-
ity engineers was submitted to the State
Legislature and Governor stating that a
bridge across the Straits of Mackinac was
both physically and economically feasible.
It was estimated in this report that the
bridge would cost $76.3 million (before
financing) and would generate enough
additional traffic so that its total cost
could be paid for out of future revenues
without increasing the fees now charged
for ferry crossing service, which is $2.09
per vehicle, and without any direct finan-
cial aid from the state. The cost of financ-
ing would run about $11 million, making
the total cost $87 million.
The report, as prepared by the Macki-
nac Bridge Authority's Board of Consult-
mg Engineers, also contained many basic
specifications covering the size of the pro-
posed bridge. The complete bridge struc-
ture would be five miles long and extend
almost due north from Mackinaw City to
JAMES A. SCHAEFER, '54 CE
James A. Schaefer
a point west of St. lgnace where the pres-
ent causeway, or mole, juts out into the
Straits.
The main span, a suspension type,
would be 3800 feet long, second only in
length to the 4200-foot Golden Gate
Bridge in San Francisco. Side spans from
main piers to the anchorages are given a
length of 1500 feet.
The remainder of the crossing calls for
a series of truss spans on concrete piers.
Twenty-two of them would vary in length
from 302 to 560 feet. Four spans near
each shore would be from 160 to 200
feet.
Steel towers supporting cables 25.6
inches in diameter would soar 565 feet
above lake level. The cables would be
anchored to foundations conceived as
huge cement blocks, the southern one of
which would be 115 by 180 feet and
extend 140 feet below lake level. It
would involve 90,000 cubic yards of con-
crete, eclipsing by far all past records.
The roadway will be 68 feet wide, with
four lanes (two in each direction) di-
vided by a low separator for safety, and
a three-foot walkway on either side. Mini-
mum clear height at the center of the span
would be 150 feet, sufficient for the larg-
est ships afloat.
Considerable effort was devoted to
determining whether the material at the
bottom of the Straits would support the
huge towers and anchorages. Two emi-
nent engineering geologists were retained.
They report that the rock formation
underlying the Straits has more than the
necessary strength to resist the pressure
that would be imposed upon it.
The design is such that the bridge
could withstand winds up to 120 miles
per hour. The highest recorded velocity
at the Straits was 78 miles per hour on
November 11, 1940.
Another highly controversial matter has
been ice. The engineers adopted extremely
severe assumptions in this matter. After
considering all the data and information
available on the subject, they are confi-
dent that their design is such that it will
withstand pressures far in excess of those
to which the piers will ever be subjected.
The structure has been designed for forces
arising from the severe assumption of ice
four feet thick and a crushing strength of
400 pounds per square inch.
The currents at the Straits present no
problem since observations reveal a maxi-
mum of less than two miles per hour.
Consideration was given to a railroad
across the bridge. The additional cost of
a single-track railway would have been
160 million (before financing). Consid-
eration was also given to a four-lane ve-
hicular tunnel. It was estimated that its
cost would have been $141 million (be-
fore financing) and its estimated cost of
operation for the first year would have
been approximately $1 million.
The report of Coverdale &amp; Colpitts of
New York, traffic engineers, says traffic
during the first year of operation of the
bridge would increase 125 per cent. This
on top of normal expected growth in ve-
hicles crossing the Straits would mean a
total of 1,850,000 would cross the bridge
during the first year of its operation and
that traffic would increase to 3,000,000 a
year by the time the revenue bonds were
retired.
At present ferry fees, according to the
Coverdale &amp; Colpitts report, sufficient
revenues would come in so that if net
available earnings were used for debt
service, bonds could be retired in 30
years. The financial analysts also included
a table of bond retirement wherein the
state would guarantee some $450,000 an-

AUTORADIOGRAPHY IN METALLURGY
One of the direct results of the atomic
age which we live in today is that here-
tofore unknown isotopes of many of
the elements are now readily available.
In most cases, these recently discovered,
man-made isotopes are radioactive; that
is, they are unstable and they will, at
some time, become converted to an iso-
tope of another element. This process of
conversion, or decay as it is usually call-
ed, is always accompanied by an emis-
sion of some type of radiation. When the
emitted radiation consists of beta particles
(electrons), the radioactive isotope is
called a beta emitter. Likewise, alpha
emitters give off alpha particles (helium

tion is detected and traced back to its
point of origin, the location of the orig-
inal isotope in the metal structure being
studied can be determined. Meanwhile,
in the interval between the introduction
and the decay of the radioactive isotope,
the metallic system can be subjected to
any of the usual metallurgical treatments
such as deformation, heat treatment, grain
growth, and phase transformation. Thus,
for the first time, the metallurgist has
available a means of obtaining informa-
tion about the influence of these treat-
ments on metallic systems by studying the
location and movement of atoms directly.
Until now, nearly all such information
technique depends on the sensitivity and
spatial resolution of the detectors used
to locate the radiation sources. Sensitivity
refers to the minimum amount of radia-
tion necessary to produce an observable
effect in the detector while resolution de-
notes the minimum distance between the
radiation sources that the detector is
capable of separating. In terms of sensi-
tivity, many methods of detection are
available that will count every particle of
radiation emitted. A Geiger counter, for
example, will detect every beta particle
that enters its sensitive volume. However,
because of its construction and an entrance
slit of finite size, the spatial resolution of

atom nuclei) during decay and gamma
rays results from photon emissions.
For the metallurgist, the radioactive
isotopes provide a new and powerful
method of investigating metallurgical
problems. Since radioactive isotopes are
practically indistinguishable chemically
from stable isotopes, they will behave
for almost all purposes, exactly like the
stable forms when introduced into metals
and their alloys. At some time after its
introduction into a metallic system, the
radioactive isotopes will undergo decay
and emit radiation. If this emitted radia-
has been obtained by an indirect study of
the atoms comprising a metallic system.
The radioactive isotope introduced into
the metallic system can be either of the
same or different species from the metal
being studied. For example, the self-
diffusion of silver in silver can be investi-
gated by the use of radioactive silver. In
another case, radioactive carbon can be in-
troduced into a steel to investigate the
distribution of carbon between the car-
bides of the various alloying elements in
steel.
The ultimate value of radioactive tracer
a Geiger counter is very low. Another
radiation detection method that has the
highest resolution developed to date but
somewhat variable sensitivity is auto-
radiography.
Autoradiography
Essentially, autoradiography refers to a
method of radiation detection in which
the emitted radiations are used to produce
a "picture" in much the same manner that
sunlight is used to produce a "picture"
in photography. There are several differ-
ent techniques employed in autoradio-

of allowing the radiation to fall on a ra-
diation-sensitive material which after
suitable development will show the loca-
tion of the radiation sources.
One widely used autoradiographic
technique is the simple, or contact, auto-
radiography. In this technique, the radia-
tion-sensitive material is usually a photo-
graphic film which is placed in contact
with the surface to be autoradiographed.
After a suitable exposure time which may
be just a few minutes or several weeks,
the film is removed and processed in con-
ventional manner as any photographic
film. The radiation will produce black-
To obtain the highest resolution in
autoradiography, several factors are re-
quired: very close contact between sur-
face and radiation-sensitive material; high
density of sensitive material, for example,
silver bromide; and a very thin layer of
the sensitive material. In addition, for best
results in high-resolution work, the radia-
tion emitted by the radioactive isotope
must be relatively weak. This is to insure
that only those radiations from the sur-
face and a very small depth under it will
reach the sensitive material while all
other radiations emanating within the
metal will be absorbed before reaching
the surface. Otherwise, correlation be-

radioactive daughter of bismuth decay.
ened areas on the film and these areas are
compared with the surface which produc-
ed the blackening. Since the surface and
film are examined separately in this tech-
nique, correlation between the two must
be made from recognizable patterns which
appear in both surface and film. In metal-
lurgical work, this often presents a diffi-
culty since similar patterns may occur
over several different places in the sur-
face and film. This difficulty plus the im-
possibility of obtaining a perfect contact

tween what is observed on the surface
of the metal and on the radiation-sensi-
tive film will be impaired.
To achieve higher resolution than is
possible in the contact technique, three
basic approaches have been made. They
are the stripping film, the emulsion paint-
ing, and the wet process techniques. Reso-
lution up to 10 microns, especially with
the wet process technique, is possible.
This means that two radiation sources
located 10 microns apart on the surface
of a metal can be detached and differen-
tiated. By T.vay of comparison, an ordin-
ary optical microscope has a resolution
limit of about 1 micron.

direct examination and correlation of the
developed silver grains and the structure
of the underlying metal surface.
The emulsion painting technique dif-
fers from the stripping film technique
only in that a liquid emulsion consisting
of silver bromide grains, gelatin, and
water is painted onto the surface to be
autoradiographed and allow to dry. One
inherent drawback of this tehnique is the
near impossibility of obtaining a uniform
layer on the sensitive material.
The wet autoradiographic process is
quite different in approach and execution
from the previous two. In the wet process,

In recent months third dimensional
motion pictures have come into the pub-
lic eye. Wearing Polaroid glasses, audi-
ences have experienced the illusion of
depth and seemingly seen lions, spears,
and other objects leaping out of the screen
at them. Film producers are investigating
various systems of making such pictures
and some observers are speculating that
this innovation may be an advantage for
Hollywood over television.
Stereoscopic, or third dimensional, mo-
tion pictures are not essentially new, much
less stereoscopy itself. William Friese-
Greene an English inventor patented in
1893 a method of stereo film projection.
As early as 1858, photographic stereo
projection was accomplished using red
and green filters. About 1832, before
photography was invented, Sir Charles
Wheatstone, of Wheatstone bridge fame,
experimented with stereoscopic pairs of
drawings and optical means of combining
them.
Since the era of the parlor stereoscope
and its cardboard mounted views in the
latter half of the last century, popular
interest in stereo photographs has de-
creased, and only in recent years have
they found new popularity. Stereoscopic
cameras and viewers for 35 and 16 mm.
film have been put on the market, en-
abling the amateur readily to make real-
istic stereo color transparencies. Polaroid,
a polarizing film invented in 1936 by
E. H. Land, made projection of color
stereo films more convenient.
There are ways besides stereoscopic
perception in which a person may visual-
ly perceive depth in a scene before him.
He may judge depth from light and
shade, perspective, haze in the distance,
etc. These factors are subject to varying
interpretations by different persons. They
could be reproduced by a perfect single
planar photograph of the scene, but not
the stereoscopic factors.
Stereoscopic perception depends upon
parallax, the apparent displacement of
an object due to change in position of the
observer. The nearer the object, the
greater the parallax. The distance be-
tween the two eyes of a person represents
a change in position of the observer and
enables a person to perceive the relative
parallax of objects and, hence, their rela-
John H. Borrowman
tive distances.
Obviously, one view from one position
provides no such comparison between
parallax of objects in a scene, and hence
no stereoscopic perception. Since the lens
of the eye or of a camera is not a single
point of view but a collection of points
separated at most by the width of the lens,
it does provide parallax, but usually of
unsatisfactory magnitude compared with
that afforded by more widely spaced
viewpoints.
The principle of stereoscopy is to pre-
sent to each eye of the observer its respec-
tive view of a scene, so that the lines of
sight from each eye to the same objects
in the two views will be in the same di-
rection as the lines of sight from each eye
to the actual objects, were the observer
viewing the actual scene represented.
The principal method is as follows:
Two photographs of the scene are
taken, one from the position of the right
eye of a hypothetical observer, the other
from the position of the left eye. The di-
rection of the cameras is usually the same
for both views; that is, the axes of the
lenses are parallel. The photographs, orig-
inal size, are viewed by the corresponding
eyes of the viewer at a distance equal to
the distance from lens to film when they
were taken. The distance may be in-
creased if the photographs are enlarged
proportionally. (This method successfully
ignores the fact that neither the lens of
the eye nor of the camera are single
points of view.)
Stereoscopic cameras consist of two
cameras which may be operated simul-
taneously, separated by a distance ap-
proximately equal to the distance between
a person's eyes. (The average human
interocular distance is 62.5 mm., or 2.46
in.) Any camera, however, can be used
to take stereoscopic pairs of photographs,
provided the subject does not move be-
tween exposures. Stereoscopic pairs of
drawings can be made by geometrical
methods or by a skilled artist.
Stereoscopic parts cannot be viewed
haphazardly, however. They must be in
rotational and vertical alignment, since
this is the normal alignment of human
binocular vision. The line of centers of
the eyes must be parallel to the lines in
the views in the direction of the line of
centers of the lenses that took the views,
since this is the direction of the parallax.
The convergence of the eyes for looking
at a distant object in the stereoscopic im-
age must be equal to or greater than zero.
The lenses in stereoscopes function as
collimators, making divergent light rays
from points in the focal plane parallel.
This is equivalent to placing the views
at an infinite distance as far as focusing
of the eyes is concerned. With the eyes
focused at infinity the focusing muscles
are relaxed. This permits the conver-
gence of the two eyes, which in ordinary
vision is coordinated with their focusing,
to be independent as it varies from object
to object in the third dimensional image.
With practice a person may train the
eye muscles so that convergence and fo-
cusing are independent and view a stereo
pair without a stereoscope (free view-
ing). This requires keeping the eyes fo-
cused on the plane of the stereogram
(stereo pair) while the convergence of
the eyes varies. When looking into the
distance, the convergence of the eyes is
zero, that is, their lines of sight are
parallel. This is the convergence for free
viewing a distant object in a stereogram
with a distance between the side by side
views of that object equal to the distance
between the eyes of the viewer. A per-
son can try this by looking at some actual
distant object while out of the corner of
his eye, without changing his gaze from
the distance, he notices the stereogram.

make a better "grasshopper"
Engineers at Western Electric's St. Paul Shops
are well pleased with their new-style "grass-
hopper" fuse—a small fuse used in Bell tele-
phone central office equipment. The former
model—in production for years—had been
gradually refined 'til it seemed almost beyond
further improvement. It was simple, inexpen-
sive, efficient, came off the line fast. But...
It's an old Western Electric engineering custom
to keep trying to make Bell telephone equip-
ment still better, at still lower cost. The "grass-
hopper" was studied by a young engineer out
of the University of Minnesota, Class of '40,
who joined the Company in 1946. His studies
indicated the most effective way to improve
efficiency and cut costs further was to change
the design.
Pursuing this lead the engineer and his group
saw their opportunity to make an important
contribution. They investigated the latest tool-
ing techniques, new metals, finishing materials
and methods, all of which are constantly under
study by engineers at Western Electric plants.
A simplified design, which permitted the use of
the most modern tooling methods, resulted in a
better fuse at lower cost that is saving thou-
sands of dollars a year for Bell telephone
companies.
There's an endless stream of such challenging as-
signments at Western Electric. Engineers of
varied skills—mechanical, electrical, civil, chem-
ical, metallurgical—find real satisfaction in
working together on the important job of pro-
viding equipment for the best telephone service
on earth.
How the grasshopper
fuse works
Small fuses like this are used by the millions
to protect certain telephone central office cir-
cuits against current overloads. Odd in appear-
ance, the fuse is called the "grasshopper" be-
cause of its spring which is released when the
fuse blows, displaying an indicator "flag" in
open view and tripping an alarm so the trouble
can be spotted and corrected at once.

Engineers are accustomed in design
and machine work to dealing with toler-
ances as fine as .001 or less, but in pre-
cision optical work the allowable tolerance
may be as fine as .00001 of an inch.
Argus Cameras, Inc., of Ann Arbor grinds
and polishes its own lenses and prisms
for use in its cameras, rangefinders, pro-
jectors, and spotting scopes (small land
telescopes). Throughout the process, the

lenses are cleaned and recleaned and
under constant checks for accuracy.
The glass blanks, as received, range in
diameter from less than 1/5 of an inch
to 2I/4 inches. The smallest lens is used
in rangefinders on cameras and the larg-
est, in the front condensers on projectors.
All the lenses are not round—Argus also
processes square lenses for certain optical
purposes.
Before they can be ground and pol-
ished, the lenses must be blocked or
mounted in pitch on iron tools which al-
low them to be held firm without being
touched by hand. The iron tools are de-
signed to fit into the grinding and polish-
ing machines. When the lenses are to be
removed from the tools the pitch is melt-
ed by heating the iron tool in a high
induction unit.
The first step in the manufacturing
process is rough grinding. Here the
curves of the lenses are generated. The
lenses are then fine ground to a tolerance
of .01 of an inch. The grinding tools have
diamond surfaces and the grinding lubri-
cant is a mixture of water and oil which
cuts the friction heat.
Polishing out the curves to the demand-
ed tolerance of .00001 of an inch is the
next process. The lenses are taken to the
polishing room where hundreds of ma-
chines work constantly, rubbing the glass
until an accurate, scratch-free surface is
produced. A fine abrasive of iron or
cerium oxide is rubbed over the surface
of the lenses by felt or pitch laps. One
machine can polish several lenses mount-
ed on one tool at one time.
Testing of lenses for accuracy of cur-
vature after polishing is done under a
monochromatic light with a Newton plate
which measures the tolerance in wave-
lengths of light. The instrument is a
glass plate with a concave surface, ground
with extreme accuracy to the exact oppo-
site of the curve desired on the lenses,
which is fitted over the convex lens to be
tested. Since the plate has a very high
accuracy, any inaccuracy of the lens will
leave an air space between the curves of
the two. The amount of air space deter-
mines the number of spectral rings that
will appear, the fewer the rings the more
accurate the lens.
Once the correct curvature has been
obtained by polishing, the lenses must be

removed from the iron tools, remounted,
and ground and polished on the other
side.
Centering is the next operation. Here
the mechanical center of a lens is made
to coincide with the optical center by
grinding off the edges of the lens. This
is to assure that the focal centers of the
mounted lenses will line up. After cen-
tering, the lenses are further cleaned with
detergent, water, and a substance called
perma-chlor to remove all traces of dust
or dirt.
The lenses are then coated to reduce
glare and speed light through them. The

coating material is magnesium flouride
applied in a vacuum. Solid magnesium
flouride is heated in a vacuum until it
vaporizes. The particles of magnesium
fluoride hit the surface of the lenses sus-
pended in the container and adhere,
forming smooth, hard coatings.
Before final assembly, some of the lenses
intended for instruments of very exact-
ing specifications are cemented together.
By cementing a lens of crown glass to one
of flint glass—crown glass of low refrac-
tive index, flint glass of high refractive
index—aberrations of light due to the
curves of the lenses, the composition of
the glass or the distance between the
lenses when mounted will be almost com-
pletely eliminated. In the process, optical
cement is applied to both lenses, the cen-
ters of the two are lined up, and the
unit is baked in special ovens for 16
hours to permanently set the cement.
During final assembly of all the lenses,
almost invisible specks of dust are re-
moved from the lenses by small vacuum
hoses. At this point, the lens surfaces are
not touched by hand. The lenses are either

how it is used
Clicker die steel is furnished to the die maker in either
single or double edged form in one of several standard
shapes. The die maker first shapes the die by bending
the die steel to a pattern that provides the desired con-
figuration, and then welds the two ends at a corner. He
finishes the die by grinding a bevel on the outside of the
cutting edge and filing the inside edge. Before the fin-
ished die is hardened and tempered, the die maker
forms identification marks — combinations of circles
and squares — in the cutting edge so that the material
cut from it may be easily identified as to its size and
style.
In the cutting operation, the leather or other material
is placed on an oak block in the bed of the clicker
machine. Then the die is placed by hand on the material
which is cut as the aluminum faced head of the machine
presses the die through it. The clicking sound which
the head makes as it strikes the die is where the term
"clicker machine" derived its name.
what it is composed of
Clicker die steel as produced by the Crucible Steel
Company of America is a controlled electric steel in
which the combination of carbon and alloy is designed
for maximum toughness and proper hardness after heat
treatment.
Experience has proved that cold finished clicker die
steel is superior to hot rolled material for sizes ap-
proximately :l \ inch and narrower because of its lower
degree of surface decarburization which permits the
use of slightly thinner sections. Cold finished material
also has a better surface finish with closer width and
thickness tolerances and thinner edges that require
less grinding and filing to complete the die.
CRUCIBLE'S engineering service
As with clicker die steel, the Crucible Steel Company of
America is the leading producer of special purpose
steels. If you have a problem in specialty steels, our staff
of field metallurgists with over 50 years experience in

Fire!
Put out an oil fire with air? Man, you
must be crazy!
That's the comeback Whiting Fire
Marshall Frang Horlbeck usually gets
when he discusses this new method of
putting out oil tank fires.
It does sound like the wrong way to
do it. Everyone knows you smother a
fire by keeping air away from it. But
this new method isn't as fantastic as it
sounds.
Actually liquid oil does not burn.
In order to burn, oil must be heated
enough to give off vapors that will mix
with air. It's this mixture that burns.
If heated oil can be cooled down to
the point where it no longer gives off
vapor, then the fire has nothing to feed
on.
With this new fire fighting technique,
air is introduced under pressure at the
bottom of the tank where oil vapors are
burning. This forces cool oil from the
bottom to circulate and lower the tempera-
ture of the hot oil on top. As the oil
cools, vapors are no longer formed, and
the fire dies down.
In tests so far, crude oil fires have not
been extinguished entirely, but flames
were reduced to a point where they could
easily be brought under control by con-
ventional methods.
Experiments with the method are still
going on, and it has not been officially
adopted as yet.

A GROWING FIELD—
Instrumentation
Modern manufacturing trends at Du Pont bring
ever-increasing opportunities for technical men
Do you think of instrumentation as
applying only to work in electricity
and electronics?
Or would you also include prob-
lems in chemical processing, mate-
rials of construction and materials
handling, as well as application of
equipment — both mechanical and
hydraulic—for measurement and
control systems?
At Du Pont, instrumentation is
applied to widely diverse areas of
manufacturing operations. It calls for
many different technical back-
grounds. In a typical instrument

Instrumentation is becoming more
and more important in the chemical
industry. In fact, many of today's
processes and products would not be
possible without modern measure-
ment and control systems. The trend
toward continuous processes means
challenging and constantly increas-
ing opportunities for instrumenta-
tion men.
Du Pont's instrument program in-
cludes research, development, design,
and supervising installation of proc-
ess control equipment. Some of the
work is done in the central Engineer-
ing Department at Wilmington.
However, most of the major plants
across the country now have their
own organized instrument groups.
Fred R. Strudor, B. Metal W., Rensselaer P.I.
'50, examines a pressure strain recorder with
Allen R. Furbeck, E.E., Princeton '39.
Richard O. Jackson, B.S. in Ch.E., Columbia
'42, and Gregory L. Laserson, Ph.D. in M.E.,
Columbia '49, test an infrared gas analyzer.
Paul D. Kohl (left), B.S. in M.E., Purdue '46,
checks the assembly of an experimental control
instrument.
So you may visualize the scope and
diversity of the work, here are ex-
amples of instrumentation recently
developed and designed by Du Pont
technical men:
1. A device to measure flow of approxi-
mately 30,000 lbs. per hour of gas at
more than 10,000 p.s.i. To give 1.2%
accuracy and be responsive to flow-
changes of five cycles per second.
2. A device to monitor continuously
1200 similar temperatures. Equipment
to record temperature and sound alarm
at a deviation of 1°C. from desired point.
3. An automatic control system to main-
tain a predetermined pressure-tempera-
ture relation in a large-batch autoclave
during spontaneous reaction between
two chemicals.
Thus it can be seen that Du Pont
instrumentation is limited to no single
avenue of engineering. Men with an
aptitude for the work get experience
in many phases of the Company's
technical activities—and anexcellent
background for positions in manage-
ment and administration.

There should be three images, a three di-
mensional one between two "ghost" im-
ages. The trick is to allow the eyes to rest
upon the center image and then focus,
but not converge, upon the plane of the
stereogram. If a person's eyes do converge,
the center image will pull apart into two
images and he will find himself looking
at the two flat views of the stereogram.
If the views are farther apart than the
distance between the eyes of the viewer,
some optical device is necessary so that
convergence for distant objects is zero or
greater, or else the eyes are required to
diverge for distant objects. The latter is
possible lo some extent for some indi-
viduals.
Another method of free viewing is to
make a transposed stereogram, that is,
with left and right views interchanged,
and view it with crossed eyes. Holding
the stereogram at about arms length, a
person can converge the eyes on a point
half-way between the eyes and the stereo-
gram, allow them to rest upon the cen-
ter three-dimensional image, and focus,
but not converge, upon the plane of the
stereogram. To aid the convergence some
small object may be held at the half-way
point.
Stereograms may be printed or pro-
jected with the two views on top of one
another and viewed with a device which
permits each eye to see only its respective
view. For instance, they may be printed
one in red ink, the other in green. A
red filter is placed before one eye and a
green one before the other. Through the
red filter the gren ink will be seen as
black, while the red ink will appear no
different than the white paper. The oppo-
site holds for the green filter. Thus each
Courtesy: Charles Wickman
eye sees only the picture printed in the
color contrasting to that of the filter in
front of it.
The Vectograph is a method similar to
the above, except that instead of contrast-
ing colors of light, mutually perpendicu-
lar orientations of polarization of light
are used. The "colors" of the "inks" and
"filters," both Polaroid films, depend up-
on their rotational orientation. As "green"
is rotated through a right angle it be-
comes "red." Accordingly, tilting the
head while viewing a Vectograph or
stereogram projected by polarized light
may cause a double image, and if carried
through a right angle, a transposition of
images. (Tilting the head also misaligns
the views, making it imposible to see the
stereoscopic image.)
In projection of ordinary black and
white or color stereo films by polarized
light the picture to be seen through the
"red" filter is projected in "red" light.
The "color" of the projected stereogram
is the same as that produced by the print-
ing method described above. For projec-
tion by polarized light a metalic screen
must be used because most other materials
depolarize the light, reflecting a whole
"spectrum" instead of the mutually per-
pendicular "colors." Rear projection can
also be used.
One consideration in projection is that
of distance of the viewer from the screen.
There is a range of distances in which the
image will not appear abnormal but
viewed from too near the stereo effect will
be flattened; from too far there will be
exagerated depth. There is one correct
distance determined by the size of the
views and the focal length of the camera
with which they were made.
Sterescopy has important application in
aerial photography, radiography, and the
sciences. Accurate contour maps may be
derived from aerial stereophotographs.
Foreign objects in the body, or flaws in a
casting may be exactly located by geom-
etrical analysis of x-ray stereograms. A
stereo-fluoroscope has also been devised.
Stereograms can be made with both light
and electron microscopes.
Whatever the future of the present
stereoscopic boom in Hollywood, many
amateur stereographers will continue to
take memorable, and often beautiful,
stereograms of the three dimensional
world they see about them.

conductors. Conductors must be suffi-
ciently large in cross-sectional area,
that is, must have sufficient low resist-
ance that the voltage drop does not be-
come excessive. In good design this
voltage drop should not exceed 3 per
cent for power circuits or 1 per cent for
lighting circuits. The conductors should
also be large enough that their tempe-
rature does, not exceed that for which
their insulation is designed. This is re-
ferred to as the current carrying capac-
ity of conductors. The current carrying
capacities of the various sizes of con-
ductors, conductor insulations and in-

lished. It should be noted that the
temperature attained by a conductor
depends not only on the amount of heat
generated but also on the thermal resist-
ance of its surroundings.
In addition to providing satisfactory
voltage drop and current carrying ca-
pacity, conductors must be designed to
provide adequate flexibility during in-
stallation and service. This is accom-
plished by building up the conductor
from one or more adequately small
wires depending on the flexibility re-
quired. For example, the conductor for
heater cord or welding cable which is
subject to repeated flexing in service is
usually made up of copper strands hav-
ing a diameter of .005" or .0063" while
the conductor for overhead weather-
proof cable may be a single wire.

a sensitive silver bromide layer is formed
chemically on the surface to be studied.
By controlling formation conditions, the
layer produced can be made 1 micron
thick and obviously in intimate contact
with the surface. The development is
done by physical rather than chemical
means, so that the size of the observed
silver grains in the final image can be
larger or smaller than the silver bromide
grains of the original layer. In the wet
layer, the silver bromide grains are about
1/2 micron in diameter. When due pre-
cautions are taken, excellent high-resolu-
tion autoradiographs can be produced.
However, this technique is more difficult
to use than the stripping film technique.
In all three of these high-resolution
techniques, the metal surface must be
protected from the solutions used in proc-
essing the sensitive layer. This is done by
applying a thin plastic coating about 1 to
3 microns rhick over the surface before
the sensitive layer is applied. This de-
creases the resolution somewhat but can-
not be avoided.

Metallurgical Applications
The fundamental evaluation of auto-
radiography as a research method in
metallurgy can be made only on the basis
of studies of specific problems. Several
such problems are currently being studied
at the University of Michigan. In the
course of these studies, contact, stripping
film, and wet process autoradiographic
techniques are used since each has its
own capabilities and limitations.
One example of a metallurgical appli-
cation of autoradiography using both che
contact and the stripping film techniques
is the study of the distribution of bis-
muth in cast, cold rolled, and annealed
copper. An alloy of copper and bismuth
is made using a small amount of bis-
muth-"", a radioactive isotope of bismuth
and a beta emitter. By comparing a typi-
cal contact autoradiograph and a photo-
macrograph of an identical area, it is evi-
dent that only gross features of the metal
surface are recognizable in the contact
autoradiograph. The contact technique is
valuable for obtaining information about

bismuth distribution on a macroscopic
scale. However, it is quite difficult to de-
duce any such information on a scale
comparable to the grain size of the cop-
per from the contact autoradiograph. By
the use of the stripping film technique,
autoradiographs of higher resolution arc
obtained. The greater ease and accuracy
in correlating the radioactivity from the
bismuth and the surface structure of
copper in che stripping film autoradio-
graphs is very evident from a typical ex-
ample shown.

view of the foil is shown and illustrates
an example of high resolution autoradio-
graphy.
Another case where the stripping film
autoradiographic technique has proved to
be a very useful tool is in the studies of
diffusion phenomena in metallic systems.
One such stripping film shown indicates
the diffusion of bismuth along grain
boundaries of copper. Experimentally, this
problem is studied by placing some radio-
active bismuth on the surface of a copper
block and allowing it to diffuse in at high
temperatures. Autoradiographs of an ap-
propriately sectioned and polished surface
will show the depth to which the bis-
muth has penetrated into the copper. In
many instances, it is difficult to positively
identify the presence of bismuth by micro-
scopic examination alone but the auto-
radiograph gives quite convincing proof
of its presence in the grain boundaries
of copper. This is typical of a case where
autoradiography can be used to substan-
tiate a tentative conclusion arrived at by
other research methods.

What does Atomic Energy really mean to you?
Dramatic new developments in medicine, agriculture,
and industry promise long-time benefits for us all
Scientists have long known that the secret core of the atom
concealed vast stores of concentrated energy. Evidence that
man had unlocked the secret came with the atomic bomb.
Then came the task of developing methods to release this
unbounded energy slowly, gradually, in ways of lasting
benefit to all of us.
ISOTOPES AN EXAMPLE—When uranium atoms are split
they emit a barrage of highly active particles. Certain chem-
icals placed in this barrage become radioactive and shoot
off particles from themselves. Substances thus treated are
called radioactive isotopes.
When these chemicals are made radioactive their paths
can be traced through plants and animals, showing the or-
gans they affect. This may increase our understanding of
the processes of life itself.
FUTURE UNLIMITED—Atomic energy is also proving use-
ful in industrial research and production. It promises to be
even more valuable, however, in providing concentrated
power for transportation, home, and industry.
UNION CARBIDE'S PART-From the beginning UCC has
had a hand in the mining and treatment of uranium ores,
the development of engineering processes, and the produc-
tion of special materials for the atomic energy program.
Under Government contract Union Carbide manages and
operates the huge research and production installations at
Oak Ridge, Tenn. and Paducah, Ky.
All of this activity fits in with the continuing efforts of
the people of Union Carbide to transform the elements of
the earth into useful materials for science and industry.

tended for use by spectrographic labora-

Atom Bomb Caarrier
A new Navy attack bomber capable
of delivering an atomic bomb from either
carrier or land stations, the North Ameri-
can AJ-2 Savage, takes off on its first flight
at Columbus, Ohio, where it is being pro-
duced. The AJ-2, an advanced version of
the AJ-1 Savage, is the largest carrier-
based bomber in the Navy's arsenal. It
weighs 26 tons, is 65 feet long, 21 feet
high and has a wing span of 75 feet. It
is powered by one Allison turbo jet and
two Pratt and Whitney reciprocating en-
gines.
Packages for Defense
General Electric's famous J47 jet en-
gines are packaged air tight and water
proof in the company's shipping room at
Lockland, Ohio, in preparation for de-
livery to aircraft companies and Air
Force depots where they will be installed
to power some of America's fastest fight-
ers and bombers.
Enough J47's are being produced by
the company's Aircraft Gas Turbine Di-
vision to make G.E. the world's largest
known jet engine producer, C. W. La-
Pierre, general manager of the Division

More than 4,000 suppliers and sub-
(Continued from page 24)
contractors make the components of the
J47 and funnel them into the company's
Lockland plant, where the majority of the
engines are assembled and tested. The
remainder of the company's J47 output is
produced at the Lynn, Mass., plant.
The J47 engine powers many of the
Air Force's famous fighters and bombers,
including the North American F-86
Sabrejets which have racked up to 15-to-1
kill ratio over Russian-built MIG's in
Korea, and the six-engine Boeing Strato-
jet.
Plane Facts
• Transports built by one major aircraft
manufacturer have flown more than
53,300,000,000 miles—far enough to
take a plane around the world two mil-
lion times, or to the moon and back
100,000 times.
• Tolerances on tiny steel balls inside
bearings of modern aircraft gyroscopes
must sometimes be a tenmillionth of an
inch—about l/4,000ths the width of the
average human hair.
• A new Navy fighter weighs more than
a standard twin-engined commercial air-

Institute Research Team
Studies Upper Atmosphere
Ever since July, 1946, an Institute re-
search team, consisting of about twenty
members, has been investigating the up-
per atmosphere for the Army Signal
Corps. The group was originally located
at Willow Run, where the planning and
preparation for measuring the physical
characteristics of the very high atmo-
sphere were begun. The Michigan pro-
gram was one of several initiated by vari-
ous military organizations after World
War II. The developments of rockets
during the war not only emphasized the
need for more fundamental knowledge
of the upper air but also made possible
the satisfactory technique of carrying the
measuring instruments directly into the
upper atmosphere. In addition to satisfy-
ing scientific curiosity and providing
information to be used in the design of
rockets, upper-air knowledge is applied

Blade Hub Grinder, used to grind

A Typical Norton Development
This specialized Norton machine
brings unusual efficiency to propeller
grinding operations. As shown, the
propeller blade is held vertically —
by a workholding fixture on a work
spindle with an anti-friction bearing
— a new departure that avoids the
errors normally caused by deflection
when the blade is held horizontally,
as in conventional methods.
The new Norton grinder has many
other improved features adding up
to greater speed, accuracy and
simplicity of operation. And it re-
quires considerably less floor space
than do horizontal machines
adapted for the same purpose.
The Broadest Line
The Norton line of grinders and
lappers is the most complete offered
by any single manufacturer. It runs
from small machines for the tool
room to high precision, high volume
units for heaviest production line
duty. Equipped with Norton
abrasive wheels these machines form
unbeatable combinations for effi-
cient, economical grinding.
To Future Technicians
As the world's largest manu-
facturers of abrasives and abrasive
products, Norton supplies basic
tools to all industry. To young men
now planning ahead, a career with
Norton offers exceptional opportu-
nities for "making better products to

grenades for measuring temperature, cos-
mic-ray telescopes, and a solar spectro-
graph, the last two having been installed
by the Navy. The flight, which was only
partially successful, started off a series
which n^.w stands at seven V-2's and
fourteen Aerobees.
In December, 1947, the project moved
to its present quarters in the Department
of Aeronautical Engineering. Two lab-
oratories are equipped to make and test
rocket apparatus for measuring pressure,
density, temperature, and composition.
The larger laboratory, Room 1520 East
Engineering, concerns itself primarily with
the first three. The emphasis here is on
electronic and mechanical devices, aero-
dynamic studies, and the reduction of
data. Experiments which have been de-
signed and tested in this laboratory for
rocket use are concerned with measuring
the shock-wave at the front of a rocket,
measuring the pressures at the front of
the rocket and in the undisturbed air, and
measuring air temperature by measuring
the rate of fall of an inflated four-foot
sphere.
(Continued from page 34)
The second laboratory, Room B-308
East Engineering, is devoted exclusively
to the problem of upper-air composition.
Vacuum pumps and sensitive leak detec-
tors are used in preparing evacuated
sampling bottles which are carried aloft
in rockets to collect upper-air samples.
Here, too, is a complex gas analyzer for
detecting small changes in the relative
amounts of nitrogen, oxygen, neon, and
helium in upper air. Another device is
used to transfer the minute amounts of air
collected in the sample bottles to glass
vials. These vials are then sent to various
other laboratories in this country and Eng-
land, where further analyses are per-
formed.
Most of the machining and construc-
tion of the many mechanical devices used
is done in the machine shop of the Aero
Engineering Department. Two machinists
are kept busy full time in making such
things as tiny pressure gages with wires
1/10,000 inch in diameter and assem-
bling V-2 warheads, which weigh more
than a ton.
The complete development and trial of
a rocket upper-air experiment requires
contributions from the fields of aerody-
namics, electronics, gas physics, chemis-
try, mathematics, and electronic and me-
chanical engineering. Sometimes two years
elapse between the conception of an idea
and the calculation of the results from a
rocket firing which carries the developed
equipment.
The rocket firing is, of course, one of
the high points in the whole process.
Usually, a group of five to eight engineers
and technicians departs for White Sands
Proving Ground in southern New Mexico
about two weeks before the launching.
The scientific equipment has been com-
pleted and tested in Ann Arbor, but it
must be mounted on the rocket and re-
tested with the rocket and its devices to
see that all operate together smoothly. At
White Sands the Michigan group is
equipped with an electronics and shop
van for use at the launching site. The
proving ground also makes available ex-
cellent laboratory facilities for final checks
and measurements. No small part of the

The first submarine installation of a pipe-type
CQOIS SySlSin was recently installed under the Hudson River
at Poughkeepsie, N.Y Three cables, each nearly % -miles long,
were simultaneously pulled into a six-inch welded steel pipe laid
across the river bottom. The pipe was then filled with oil main-
tained at 200 lbs. pressure, enabling a 110,000-volt power circuit
to cross the river safely.
This kind of system is called Oilostatic— a design which has long
been first choice among utilities for handling large blocks of power
by means of a high-pressure pipe-type cable system. Increased cir-

are realized.

BY
HERBERT HOOVER
The following article it the text of a
speech delivered by Herbert Hoover to stu-
dent engineers at the Northwest Engineering
Centennial, Portland, Oregon, August 9,
1952. Wa are joining the other magazines
of the Engineering College Magazines As-
sociations in presenting it to the Michigan
engineers.
This is not a poliitcal speech. My first
text comes from the agreement of both
political platforms that the nation is
mired down in a swamp of spending, in-
flation and taxes. Both parties disagree on
who-done-it. They seem to agree upon
the obvious that reduction of Federal ex-
penditures would be a good step to get
out of the swamp but there is wide dis-
agreement on where to begin and how
much.
However I am suggesting something
else which is a partial method of relief,
and that is where the engineers come in.
That partial remedy for our ills is with
all our might to stimulate scientific dis-
covery, invention and their application by
our engineers. That would increase pro-
ductivity per capita and thereby mitigate
these burdens. I do not guarantee it can
work fast enough to save the American
way of life but it could help.
The basis of this hope lies in our ex-
perience from three great hot wars. By in-
creased productivity after these wars the
credit of our nation was restored and the
prosperity of our people moved into high
levels. That was true after the War of the
Revolution, the Civil War, and the First
World War. But this extension of the
Second World War into six years of cold
war is where my belief comes from that
this is now only a partial remedy. Other-
wise a continuation of these spending,
taxing and inflation policies can have but
one result. That is a national socialistic
state.
After the War of the Revolution free
initiative in expansion of our agriculture
and the application of steam power in the
factories increased our productivity, re-
stored our national credit and gave a great
lift to the standard ot living.
After the Civil War the expansion of
the railways brought millions of new fer-
tile acres into productivity. With this,
and with growing skills in free industry
the nation again recovered and marched
forward.
Courtesy, Michigan Daily
Herbert Hoover
After World War I, scientific discov-
eries and inventions, and still more
growth of skills and improved processes
found expression in the expansion of mo-
tor transport and electrification, radio and
airplanes. And from cheaper costs of pro-
duction we remedied the ravages of war
and rose to the highest average standard
of living in all humr.n history.
Since the Second World War we have
again made great advances in science and
invention We have built many improved
plants but we have not yet been able to
catch up with the spenders and the tax-
collectors.
One warrant for my hope lies in the
fact that we, with only six percent of the
world's population, have today more
trained scientists and engineers than all
the rest of the world put together.
The application of new scientific dis-
coveries and new inventions is always a
business speculation. It is based on ven-
ture capital and plowing in of profits
until production is in full bloom.
There are two obstructions in the path
of such a solution of our economic prob-
lems. The first is unintelligent taxation
and the second a coming national famine
in technologists. I could enumerate a
dozen other destructors, but I said this
would not be a political speech.
An Example
There is no better exhibit of what ill-
considered taxation can do to our econ-
omy than our non-ferrous metal industry
in the West. That industry is founded
wholly on venture capital and the plowing
in of profits until a mine is equipped and
producing. Today such venture capital
from individuals is itself undermined
and taxation prevents the necessary plow-
ing in. That is not theory; it is a fact.
Twenty years ago there were about 3,000
operating non-ferrous metal mines in the
Rocky Mountain area. Today there are
only a few more than 1,000. I recently
made a canvass of the operators of many
of the large mines which were developed
in a more favorable economic climate. I
asked a simple question—could this enter-
prise have ever been developed and
equipped under present taxation and other
restrictions on freedom? The answer was
No in every case but one, and that case
had been a bonanza so rich as to defy
even the tax-collector. But today even in
most of these surviving enterprises the
government takes from the stockholder
about $85 out of every $100, earned be-
fore taxes, and if he received the remain-
ing $15, there would be no fund left to
plow into constantly needed improve-
ments to treat decreasing grades of ore.
From it all, the nation is becoming
short of these domestically produced
metals.
By stimulated scientific methods we can
reduce costs and thus do something to aid
this industry. But more intelligent taxes
on mines such as those in other countries
would sustain the industry. It would be
cheaper than government subsidies.
The same problems apply to the other
industries where venture capital and plow-
ing in are their characteristics.
But there has arisen an alternative ap-
plication of new ideas which bodes little
good to our society. The established in-
dustries can and do undertake such risks
in their fields. They can write off their
losses against taxes, and the venture costs
nothing. The inventor, the prospector or
the individual has little chance of this
relief. The consequence is that existing
enterprises absorb the new discoveries and
inventions. They grow in size and monop-
olistic strength but the opportunity for
the individual to establish his indepen-
dent and competitive business is greatly
diminished.

A Fertile Place for
Careers to Grow*
A broad vista of opportunity opens up for college graduates who
come to work for Reynolds. The phenomenal rise of the Reynolds
Metals Company, known throughout business and industry, is
clearly depicted by the above chart. The five-fold expansion in
total production of aluminum ingot alone spells broad opportunity.
Add to this the vast and productive fabricating facilities of Reynolds
—in themselves an enterprise of considerable proportions—and here
indeed is a fertile field for any ambitious engineer.
From bauxite mining through metals refining and fabrication
to application engineering, sales and marketing, Reynolds offers
broad career opportunities. Operating 27 plants in 13 states, and
still expanding, there is virtually no limit to what can be accom-
plished by a capable graduate engineer.
Preliminary orientation in production and sales...direct on-the-
job training... liberal insurance, hospitalization and retirement
programs... these are all parts of a sound personnel policy main-
tained at Reynolds.

Message Repeater
Practitioners have a new electronic
aide in the Message Repeater, a small
sized, high fidelity sound system which
will record any spoken message up to
two minutes in length and can be set for
continuous repetition. Only six inches in
length and weighing six pounds, the new
(Continued from page 36)
device will faithfully record vocal inton-
ation on a plastic tape. In addition to the
two minute tape, cartridges are available
for recordings of 15, 20, 30, 60 or 90
seconds duration, and other time interval
tapes may be made on special order.
In addition to the continuous play-back,
the unit can be set for one-time operation
and can be activated by manual control or
by any number of remote control devices,
such as pneumatic switches set in flood
mats, photo electric cells, time clock con-
trol, etc.
In busy offices the unit can be set to
repeat its message when the patient enters
a room and give preliminary instructions,
as well as its obvious use in therapy.
Operation of the Message Repeater is
simple. Recordings are made by speaking
into a hand microphone which is plugged
into the unit and any previous recordings
made on the same tape are automatically
erased. However, the cartridges contain-
ing the tape are interchangeable and pre-
viously recorded messages may be used
at will.

We Are Running Short of Engineers
We have in our profession another
great national problem. We do not have
enough engineers in incubation to carry
on the nation's work. We need 60,000
new technologists a year to supply na-
tional needs. Our engineering graduates
have dropped from 50,000 in 1950 to
38,000 in 1951, and the students in train-
ing indicate less than 30,000 next year.
Yet our universities have ample facilities
to fill the demand.
One reason for this drop is that a
young mechanic with three years of train-
ing, during which he is paid, can earn
more take-home pay after taxes than a
young engineer with six years of training
and three years more of experience. Too
often the financing of engineering train-
ing is too expensive for his Dad. And
with increased tuition and living costs it
is more and more difficult for boys by off-
time work to make their way through col-
lege as many of us did.
The answer must come from the in-
dustries. They must consider their respon-
sibility to aid promising boys. For it is
(Continued from page 40)
upon such boys that future existence of
industry depends.
The Engineering Profession
But there are more cheerful subjects
for discussion among engineers. I have re-
viewed them many times in the past.
Within a little more than my lifetime,
the training of engineers has risen from
apprenticeship to a trade or secondary
technical schools to the dignity of a uni-
versity-trained profession.
As indicative of the distance the engi-
neers have risen in public repute, I might
recall that some years ago while crossing
the Atlantic, I took my meals at the same-
table with a cultivated English lady. As
we came into New York Harbor, at
breakfast she said: "I hope you will for-
give my dreadful curiosity, but I should
like awfully to know what is your pro-
fession." I said that I was an engineer.
Her involuntary exclamation was: 'Why,
I thought you were a gentleman."
The engineer has a high privilege
among professions. He has the fascina-
tion of watching a figment of his im-
Air Conditioning

bombers, "404" transports, and other famous planes, uses 27
Frick compressors for air conditioning and special cooling serv-
ices in its great plant at Middle River, Md. These machines

agination emerge with the aid of science
to a plan on paper. Then it moves to
realization in cement, metal or energy.
Then it adds to the security and comfort
of homes.
Engineering training by our univer-
sities has other great values to the country
than its industrial consequences. It in-
stills character in those who would join
its ranks, for high ethical standards are
the essential of all professions. Technol-
ogy without intellectual honesty does not
work. Construction without conscientious-
ness soon crumbles. Here is the invoca-
tion of veracity in a world sodden with
intellectual dishonesty. These are the rea-
sons you have seen no engneers before the
Kefauver Committee. Nor in the head-
lines wlvch these days pour forth from
Grand Juries and District Attorneys' of-
fices. The engineers' main appearance in
public is only to sit on juries and com-
mittees for reform.
From the work of the engineers comes
the lifting of men's minds beyond the
depressing incidents of the day. And here
is the rejuvenation of spirit and confi-
dence in the future of our country.
In any event you will agree that the
engineer is an antidote to evil and the
bearer of blessings. Even including his
antidote to inflation.
In closing, let me repeat a statement
from a good engineer of just exactly four
hundred years ago. He referred to the
mining engineers but his general toler-
ance is warranty for its application to
all engineers. "Inasmuch as the chief
callings are those of the moneylender,
the soldier, the merchant, the farmer, and
miner, I say, inasmuch as usury is odious,
while the spoil cruelly captured from the
possessions of the people innocent of
wrong is wicked in the sight of God and
man and inasmuch as the calling of the
miner excels in honor and dignity that of
the merchant trading for lucre, while it is
not less noble though far more profitable
than agrculture, who can fail to realize
that it is a calling of peculiar dignity?''
Two hipsters, in a museum spotted a
bust of Julius Caesar. One said to the
other, "This guy has been gone for two
thousand years."
The other replied, "Crazy man, those
Romans really knew how to live."

on thousands off applications
Rollpin is a hollow, split, cylindrically formed pin with chamfered
ends. It is simply driven into holes drilled to normal production toler-
ances. Because Rollpin is slightly larger than standard sized holes,
it compresses as inserted. It is self-locking—and vibration-proof—
because of the constant pressure it exerts against hole walls. Its shea.-
strength exceeds that of a cold rolled pin of the same diameter. Rollpin
is readily removed with a drift or pin punch—and can be reused.
Because of its versatility—and the production economies it makes
possible—Rollpin is finding wide usage in almost every phase of manu-
facturing activity. Write for design information on the Rollpin. It will
enable you to cut costs for many applications where use of rivets, set

The lenses are then mounted. Each instrument contains
several lenses, up to 15 or 20 in some cases, and some con-
tain small mirrors and prisms. In the Argus C4, deluxe 35
millimeter camera, there are seven lenses and three mirrors,
the mirrors and four of the lenses in the range-finder and three
lenses in the objective lens assembly.
When both sides of the lenses have been ground, polished,
and tested, they are removed from the tools and go into a
trichlorethylene unit. This unit is widely used in industry to
degrease metals and glass. Trichlorethylene is efficient in re-
moving organic tars and is a solvent which can be cleaned

RADIOACTIVE ISOTOPES
(Continued from page 32)
A wet process autoradiograph of radioactive nickel c3 electro-
plated on a thin foil of silver shows the very high resolutions
possible in this technique. Although the silver foil is only about
10 microns thick, the autoradiograph has clearly differentiated
the two sources of radioactivity located on the two surfaces of
the foil. This probably represents the highest resolution auto-
radiograph made to date.
These few particular applications mentioned serve as an
indication of the scope and usefulness of radioactive isotopes
and autoradiography in metallurgy. Together they constitute a
very new research method and one that is destined to have an
important role in increasing our knowledge of metals and
their alloys.

A recent survey found that 40 per cent of the
top jobs in industry are now held by men
with broad engineering training. In General
Motors, the chairman of the board, presi-
dent and 19 vice-presidents are engineers of
wide experience and training.
Yes, there's a great future in store for young
engineers with well rounded training in the
dynamic automobile industry which has
shown continual growth.
And while the industry itself has shown this
steady growth, Pontiac has grown even more
spectacularly. Today Pontiac holds an envi-
able position. Its reputation for quality and
its public acceptance are unsurpassed.
There is, indeed, a future with Pontiac. But
even more important to you is the fact that
one of the most practical ways to this great
future is by way of designing. Did you know
that the majority of all leading positions in
automobile engineering are held by men
who have had experience in designing?
There's no better route for the young man
who wants a well rounded engineering career
based on opportunity, future advancement
and liberal General Motors compensation

Spring is finally here! Birds are twit-
tering in the trees, flowers are in bloom,
and blooming also is that spring-time urge
to lay the books aside and just go out and
lay in the sun.
Engineer! Resist that impulse! Finals
are coming. However, if you must take a
break from the books, grab your Technic.
your pencil and paper, and while you re-
lax sharpen up the ol" intellect with a few
Teasers.
Here, for your relaxation and enjoy-
ment, is a dilly.
Two men, Jones and Smith, were seat-
ed on a north-bound train moving 54
miles per hour. Both stood up and start-
ed at the same time for the observation
car 750 feet in the rear. Jones walked at
the rate of 150 feet a minute while Smith
walked only half as fast. How far north
of the point from which he started was
Smith when Jones reached the observa-
tion car?
This Teaser is especially for the Chem
Engineers. However, I suppose that any-
one who could get through Chem 5E
has qualified to work this, so even you
ME's should be able to obtain a solution.
(To obtain a solution just dissolve this in
water.)
One morning a certain chemical reac-
tion started at exactly a quarter of the
hour. The chemical reaction finished pre-
cisely at the first meeting of the minute
and the hour hands If the chemical re-
action took more than an hour, what was
the exact time it started and how long
did it take?
Here's one for all you nature lovers.
A rabbit traveling at a constant rate
of two miles per hour passes a brier patch
at noon. Ten minutes later a hound dawg
traveling at a constant rate of six miles
per hour passed the brier patch and fol-
lowed the rabbit's tracks. When did the
hound dawg catch up with the rabbit?
The ancient Inca capital Quito, Kisumu
on Lake Victoria in Kenya, and Pontianak
in Borneo are all within half a degree
from the equator. The longitude of Quito
is 78° West of Greenwich, Kisumu 35°
East, and Pontianak 109° East. Find the
shortest distance between each two of
these places.

This teaser may tax your ingenuity
just a bit.
Weight A is 195 lbs., weight B in 105
lbs., weight C is 90 lbs., and weight D is
75 lbs., and all four weights are on a
raised platform. The only way to lower
them is by means of a rope run through
a pulley with a basket on each end. The
rope is just long enough so that when
one basket is on the ground the other is
at the pulley next to the weights. If the
difference between the loads is greater
than 15 lbs. then any weight except D
will be damaged. How can they be low-
ered without damage?

If a five-pound magnet, a two-pound
magnet and a one-tenth pound magnet
each have a pull of one ounce, then how

A committee consists of chairman, sec-

sit at a straight table on the platform
behind the speaker if (a) no places are
reserved, (b&gt; the middle seat is reserved
for the chairman, (c) the secretary and
the treasurer must sit on either side of
the chairman, who is occupying the mid-

the right and the treasurer on the left of
the chairman occupying the middle seat?
Ferdinand saw a line of stevedores
walking to and from a certain stack of
boxes. The stevedores were always equi-
distant apart and traveled at a constant
speed. Ferdinand headed for the stack
also at a constant rate of speed. For every
stevedore that passed him he met three
going in the opposite direction. How
much faster than Ferdinand were the
stevedores going?

Corrosion Test, developed
in Standard Oil laborato-
ries, is operated by Tech-
nician John Becich. It
measures the corrosion of
bearings due to oxidation
of motor oil.
Some men can't wait for time!
The familiar saying that "time waits for no
man" has been given a reverse twist by Standard
Oil scientists.
These chemists and engineers, impatient with
time's measured pace, don't wait for time.
In our research laboratories at Whiting, for
example, scientists discover the effects of months,
even years, of elapsed time on petroleum products
in a few hours. They artificially age certain prod-
ucts as much as 12 months in five hours. Some of
these aging processes have originated in Standard
Oil laboratories. Two such tests are the Indiana
Stirring Sand Corrosion Test and the Indiana Stir-
ring Oxidation Test. In two days these two proc-
esses determine the effect upon oil of months of
normal driving.
Other artificial aging processes include the
weatherometer, which manufactures rain, sun-
shine and heat to test the wearing quality of
asphalt. The gasoline stability test uses heat, and
oxygen under pressure, to determine how long gas-
oline can be stored without deteriorating.
This speeding up of time is characteristic of the
restless curiosity that makes it possible to bring new
and improved products to Standard Oil customers
years sooner than might otherwise be possible.

nually toward operating expenses. Such a
guarantee would reduce interest rates and
hasten the day of a free and clear bridge
to about 28 years.
The Authority's three consulting engi-
neers are recognized throughout the world
as the leading designers of long span
bridges. Dr. David B. Steinman of New
York has won nearly every honor for
bridge design. Othmar H. Ammann,
Chief Engineer of the New York Port
Authority, is among the leading bridge-
designers and consultants in the world.
From the west coast comes Glenn B.
Woodruff of San Francisco, whose ex-
perience with the Golden Gate, Trans-
Bay, and scores of other bridges makes
him third man in a trio of bridge design
talent that could be assembled no where
else in the nation. All three consulting
engineers have said that nothing in the
entire bridge project presents a problem
that has not already been solved in the
construction of other bridges.
The actual designing of the bridge has
(Continued from page 11)
been a long and tedious process, involv-
ing many bridge design authorities, scores
of draftsmen, hundreds of man hours,
and a considerable amount of money. In
beginning the design, a $2,000 model, an
exact replica of the proposed bridge, was
built from which the designers made esti-
mates on the drawing of plans ranging
from $1,500,000 to $3,000,000. The
Mackinac Bridge Authority set a tenta-
tive cost of $2,000,000 for plans and
work leading up to actual construction.
A period of from 18 months to two years
will be required to complete necessary
borings, plans and specifications.
In the meantime, plans for the financ-
ing of the mammoth structure have been
rapidly drawn up. In May of 1952, an
application for a loan of $85,000,000
from the Reconstruction Finance Corpora-
tion was filed with Harry A. McDonald,
RFC administrator. As yet there is no in-
dication whether the loan will be favor-
ably considered by the RFC, but Gov. G.

Such smoothness of operation assures

The achievement of such results

chairman of the Straits Bridge Authority,
have both indicated that the outlook for
obtaining funds to construct the span is
"optimistic."
Three financing plans are under con-
sideration to obtain funds for building
the bridge. One of them is a "complete"
loan from RFC to cover all planning and
construction costs. Another plan would
involve an attempt to raise the entire
sum from revenue bonds sold to private
investors. The third method would be a
combinat'on of federal and private funds,
based on an application to RFC for one-
third of the cost with the remaining two-
thirds coming from private bondholders.
The bridge authority prefers a complete
loan from RFC as a means of holding
interest payments on the loan to a mini-
mum during the construction period. If
the RFC loan is not forthcoming, con-
sulting engineers have tentatively pro-
posed an $87,000,000 revenue bond issue-
to cover the over-all cost of the project
which, at an interest rate of 3J/2 percent,
could be retired in 28 years if all gross
revenues from toll charges were made
available for debt service. This assumes
that the state would bear the cost of main-
tenance, estimated at from $300,000 to
$450,000 per year.
The tremendous bridge project which
has been near the hearts of generations
of Michigan sportsmen and vacationers is
moving close to realization with each suc-
cessive day. Construction of the bridge-
will not be begun for a while and the
estimated time of actual construction will
approximate four years. But Michiganders
are at last assured that it will become a
reality. The controversy that has raged for
many years over the feasibility of build-
ing such a bridge is fast fading. And
when at last the Mackinac Straits Bridge
is completed, it will demand recognition
as a tribute to American engineering
prowess.
Two men, neither very bright, were

some and throwing others away.
"Why are you throwing away so many

"Because they are pointed the wrong
way. They have the head on the wrong
end."
"You fool. Those arc for the other side

Most of the current alloys developed for engineering
use at elevated temperatures contain Molybdenum.
As stresses and temperatures—such as those used for
marine propulsion power plants—increase, it is certain that
the alloys which make this possible will rely more and
more upon their Molybdenum content.

Not long ago, one of our city-bred en-
gineering graduates was making a trip
through the country. As he passed a fer-
tile field he spied an unusual sight—a
farmer helping a calving. Now our engi-
neer didn't have the slightest idea what
was happening, and he stopped his car
to watch the spectacle. He could tell that
the farmer was having an awful time as-
sisting the cow.
Presently he got out of the car ap-
proached the farmer, and said, "Want
some help?" And so sweating and strain-
ing, he assisted the farmer at the difficult
task. Then at last, the calf was born.
Gratefully, the farmer accompanied
the engineer to his automobile to see
him off. But hesitating, as he wiped the
sweat from his brow, the engineer looked
up and said, "Say, mister, just how fast
was the calf going, when it hit the cow?"

A couple of officials were walking by
Oak Ridge, when they discovered a
strange unidentified object lying on the

airplane and drop it to see what would
happen. They flew over some woodland

hit the ground it blew up. Just then a
long bearded old man wearing a Confed-
erate uniform and shouldering a musket
came running out of the woods. As he
looked up and saw the atomic mushroom
he said, "I don't know what Lee's going
to do, but I'm going to surrender."

She looked down at his small size and

You'll be at the head of the jet parade at Boeing
For long-range opportunities, it's hard to
beat the jet aircraft field. If you want to
get into this exciting branch of engineer-
ing after you graduate, get in at the
head of the parade—at Boeing.
Through the fighter-fast B-47 six-jet
bomber, and the giant new eight-jet B-52,
Boeing has acquired more experience de-
signing, flying and building multi-jet
aircraft than any other company, either
here or abroad. In addition, Boeing is
the first American company to announce
its entry into the jet transport field.
Engineering graduates will find in
the aviation industry an unusually wide
range of experience, and great breadth
of application — from pure research to
production design, all going on at once.
Boeing is constantly alert to new tech-
niques and materials, and approaches
them without limitations. Extensive sub-
contracting and major procurement pro-
grams, all directed and controlled by
engineers, afford varied experience and
broad contacts and relationships.
Aircraft development is such an inte-
gral part of our national life that young
graduates can enter it with full expecta-
tion of a rewarding, long-term career.
Boeing, now in its 36th year of opera-
tion, employs more engineers todav than
even at the peak of World War II. Its
projects include guided missiles, research
on supersonic flight and nuclear power
for aircraft.
Boeing engineering activity is concen-
trated at Seattle in the Pacific Northwest,
and Wichita in the Midwest. These
communities offer fine fishing, hunting,
golf, boating and other recreational facil-
ities. Both are fresh, modern cities with
fine residential sections and shopping
districts, and schools of higher learning
where engineers can study for advanced
degrees.
There are openings in ALL branches
of engineering (mechanical, civil, elec-
trical, aeronautical, and related fields),
for DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION,
RESEARCH and TOOLING. Also for servo-
mechanism and electronics designers and
analysts, and physicists and mathemati-
cians with advanced degrees.

ing by set owners and will permit elimination of the external
knobs or controls now needed for focusing on some tele-
vision sets.
G-E engineers said that the new gun also will make possible
clearer picture definition across the entire television screen.
The gun was displayed for the first time tonight at the
national convention of the Institute of Radio Engineers at
Grand Central Palace.
The gun in a television picture tube "fires" an electron
beam from inside the neck of the tube to the tube face. The
beam, deflected so that it sweeps across the entire tube face,
produces the picture.
The new gun includes a focusing device not found in guns
now in use. Present tubes require an added magnetic attach-
ment outside the neck of the tube to focus the picture. By
placing the focusing mechanism inside the neck of the tube
and closer to the electron beam, a closer control of picture
focusing is possible.
G-E engineers also pointed out that a major cause of the
variations in focusing on present screens is the variation in the
voltage reaching the picture tube. The new gun is less sus-
ceptible to major voltage fluctuations than guns now in use.
G-E displayed a 21-inch tube incorporating the new gun at
the I.R.E. show and announced that it has immediate plans to
add other tubes to its line using the new gun.
The gun and the new focusing system, known technically as
"internal magnetic focus," will eventually be designed into
tubes which may be used as replacements for tubes now in use
in sets already in operation or on the market. The gun may
also be applied to other applications, such as radar, in which
cathode ray tubes are used.
The new gun also incorporates a device known as an "ion
trap" used to divert undesirable ions in the electron beam. On
present tubes the ion trap is attached to the outside of the
tube neck.
In addition to permitting permanent focusing and a shaper
picture, the new gun will permit manufacturers of television
receivers to eliminate certain parts used to control focus.
Focusing and ion trap devices in the new gun employ four
tiny Carboloy "Alnico 5" magnets made of the most powerful
permanent magnetic material now being produced. Three of
the Alnico magnets, measuring a quarter of an inch in diame-
ter and five-eighths of an inch in length, are used in focusing
and the fourth, measuring one-eighth of an inch in diameter
and length, is used in the ion trap.

Instruction in surveying and geology is offered to students of Civil Engineering at Camp
Davis during the summer session. The camp is situated in Jackson Hole about 20 miles
south of Jackson. U. S. Highway 187, which connects the Lincoln Highway at Rock
Springs, Wyoming, with the Yellowstone Park, passes within a mile of the camp.
A splendid climate with clear days and cool nights, a considerable area clear of trees
and brush, and a topography varying from gentle slopes to rugged mountains, com-
bine to make this region an ideal one for surveying practice. The area is also interest-
ing geologically, offering many examples of problems likely to be encountered by the
engineer in practice.
Students and staff are housed in permanent buildings provided with running water,
electric lights and a modern sanitary system. The mess furnishes excellent meals.

GO PRO
There appeared in a magazine article recently a
statement that engineers have been seeking the pres-
tige for their vocation which the classification "pro-
fession" offers, and are gradually attaining that goal.
Inherent in the old meaning of profession is the ad-
jective "learned" as would be applied to such pur-
suits as law, medicine, and theology. However, in
modern times, we have added gregarious protection
of interests and common goals through the efforts
of professional societies not unlike the medieval
guilds. Although the writer does not believe that
engineering can truthfully be called a profession by
the very nature of the occupations involved, we
might investigate the possibilities which the latter
modification to the definition of profession offers in
the field of engineering.
Every major branch of engineering and practically
every conceivable sub-division of these fields has its
society; even women engineers have banded together
recently. There are advantages to membership in the
engineering professional associations of which stu-
dent engineers especially should recognize. Engineer-
ing, like medicine and law, has become a very spec-
ialized endeavor. In college it is all too common for
a student to say that he is not going to use a par-
ticular course that is required if it is taught by
another department. He cannot understand why he
must suffer it, and he does not put his heart into it.
He has heard graduate engineers say that most of
his usable knowledge will come from his industrial
experiences. Because of the concentration of courses
in his particular field, he loses sight of another ob-
jective of an engineer, specifically, to be able to
apply the engineering approach to the solution of
all problems. Because all branches of engineering are
inter-related and dependent on each other, it is im-
possible to avoid having a useful knowledge of the
mechanics of each branch.
Very few schools are offering generalized engin-
eering courses; fewer yet are allowing enough credit
hours for technical electives. Engineering is a nar-
row curriculum, and as more industrial develop-
ments are made, will become more so. Surely there
is no excuse for engineering becoming a narrow pro-
fession because of narrow training on the college
level. There is no excuse for narrowness within the
profession, that is, a chemical engineer not knowing
the problems of an electrical engineer. It is fairly
obvious that the current demand for engineers stems
not only from a shortage of graduates, but also from
a shortage of all-around engineers in the field. One
of the remedies would be a de-specialization. This, of
course, would demand a higher quality of graduates
because engineering would then be lifted out of the
realm of routine.
Since this de-specialization must begin at the
roots, the responsibility for the future progress and
prestige of the engineering field lies with the college
student. This is accomplished by continued learning
in all fields before graduation as well as after. If
time permits, an especially easy way to achieve this
aim is through a professional society's meetings.
Student membership is a convenience and an "in".
It gives the student a view of the whole before he
becomes involved by a small part. The chances are
very much in his favor that he will be a more quali-
fied engineer upon graduation. Membership in a
professional society seems a small way to bring the
field the prestige which it would like to enjoy, and
it is the one way in which both the profession and
the member have a mutual share in the benefits.

FUTURE JOBS ARE BEING ENGINEERED
Your future lies not in the obvious, the

the drawing boards, in the laboratories
and within the minds of men.
Don't look to what is, but to what shall
be. Fortune comes from the new.
This Air Force Radio tower, a 1218-foot
equilateral steel triangle, is the tallest in
the world; second among man-made
structures only to the Empire State Build-
ing. It was designed and fabricated by
Republic's Truscon Steel Division. The
operation of this tower is government
business. But its stresses and its resistances
are Republic's. The engineering of this
lacy pinnacle will find adaptations in the
near future. They are being shaped now
in the metallurgy and design departments
of Republic. A quarter mile above the
earth, the steel toys with gales and totes
an unpredictable burden of ice. And the
facts of these achievements shall be trans-
lated by men of your generation into the
still higher pinnacles of the future.
Republic's Truscon Steel Division leads
the world in radio towers. Republic's other
divisions push forward other frontiers. No
manufacturer makes more kinds of steel,
nor any better. But the making of steel is
only one phase of Republic. Our many
divisions design innumerable products,
fabricate thousands of items.

Mechanics prepares you to work with
structures and electricity prepares you to
work with motors and machines, but how
are you preparing to work with men? To
engineers who have finished school and
are now working in industry this ques-
tion is a very familiar one, but what about
the engineers who are still in school?
How would you answer the question first
asked? Could it be that you would have to
reply by explaining that you had never
considered it? If you do have to answer
this way, you are not alone. In some firms
only one out of every three engineers has
prepared himself to work with personnel.
The reason for the large degree of unpre-
paredness among engineers is that only
recently has industry considered it neces-
sary that engineers be trained in per-
sonnel work as well as mechanics.
Don't let the term "industrial psychol-
ogy" scare you out of any further reading.
It is only a two dollar name for the scien-
tific approach to the explanation of man's
behavior in industry.
Psychology's entry into the industrial
field came just about the time of World
War I. Our government found it neces-
sary to induct a large number of men into
the armed forces within a short period of
time. In order to do such a job success-
fully, a test, or series of tests, was needed
which could accurately reveal the apti-
tudes and intelligence of the men. The
psychologists were successful in construct-
ing such tests. After the tests' success in
the armed forces, they were adopted by
industry to help them in their employee
selection and placement.
The tests were not as successful in in-
dustry as they were in the armed forces,
and, as a result, industry began to look
upon industrial psychology with disfavor.
However, as the psychologists' knowledge
and methods improved, industry again
began to accept the work and findings of
the industrial psychologists. The differ-
ences between their interest this time and
their initial interest was that this time
their interest included more than just the
tests. It covered the entire field of human
relations. This latest step started in the
late 1930's and the early 1940's.
Let me cite a few examples of today's
use of industrial psychology. These ex-

amples will point out some of the prin-
ciples used in industry.
One of the most basic ideas of indus-
trial psychology, in fact of all psychology,
is that all of man's behavior is caused.
He doesn't just happen to act a cer-
tain way in a situation. If a man
comes to work grumpy and irritable,
it may be that the neighbors kept him
awake all night with their partying or
that his wife didn't get up early
enough to get him a good, warm break-
fast. In such a case, when he gets mad or
makes a mistake, the proper approach is
to pay as little attention as possible to his
behavior, knowing that if he had gotten
enough sleep the night before or had
eaten a good breakfast that morning he
wouldn't have acted as he did. Punishing
him only makes him more irritable and
harder to get along with. Nothing has
been done to remove his frustrations by
punishing him.
Psychology in industry is also reflected
in the design of industrial products. A
few years ago, the primary object in de-
signing machinery was its mechanical effi-
ciency. Now more than just mechanical
efficiency is important. Some other im-
portant factors are:
Is the design such that it causes the
least amount of eyestrain?
Are the manual controls easily and
safely accessible?
Are the manual operations simplified to
reduce human exhaustion?
Many factors such as these are consid-
ered in both product and machine design.
Industry's use of psychology has done
much to solve the problem of motivating
the workers. Many industrialists still be-
lieve that the best incentives and sources
of motivation are improvements such as
wage increases, shorter hours, and longer
vacations. Psychologists have proved,
however, that these factors are not the
most efficient incentives. What are more
important factors are competition among
workers on the same job, praise for good
work, and group decisions in setting pro-
duction goals. One of the basic reasons
for today's industrial unrest is that most
of the incentives presented by manage-
ment do not supply the rewards necessary
to satisfy the needs presented by the work-
er's job. The promise of higher pension
payments are very unsuccessful in re-
moving the frustrations created by
monotonous production line jobs.
A very good example of how the appli-
cation of psychological incentives im-
proves production is shown by an ex-
periment carried out by Coch and French.1
The experiment call for four groups of
workers, all of whom had been doing
the same job for some time. All groups
were given a new job to do (the same
job for all groups). The variable factor
was the way in which the new job was
presented.
In the control group the new job was
presented in the normal manner for that
plant. The production department modi-
fied the job, and a new piece rate was set.
A group meeting was then held in which
the control group was told that the change
was necessary because of competitive con-
ditions and that a new piece rate had been
set. The new piece rate was thoroughly
explained by the time study man, ques-
tions were answered, and the meeting was
dismissed.
Experimental group 1 was changed in
a different manner. Before any changes
took place, a group meeting was held
with all the operators to be changed. The

ANNE K. CAMPBELL, '55E
This article Is condensed end revised
from a speech presented at the twentieth
annual meeting of the Southeastern Electric
Exchange, entitled "Atomic Power end
Electric Power" written by Walker L. Cisler,
President and General Manager of the De-
troit Edison Company. This company—
teaming with the Dow Chemical Company
—was one of the first groups to ini-
tiate and develop the use of atomic power
in industry. Mr. Cisler, with his company,
has done a great deal to further the de-
velopment of the atomic factor in tech-
nology.
Atomic energy is a subject which has
caught and held the interest of people
more completely than any other topic to-
day. There is a continued succession of
news releases, articles and speeches about
the subject and yet there is a continuing
demand for more and more information.
This is a healthy attitude because atomic
energy may well become an important fac-
tor in our lives. But on the other hand, it
is quite probable that we are building up
expectations which will be filled very
slowly at best. There is so much to be
accomplished and the problems are so un-
usual that a long period of experimenta-
tion and development lies ahead before
atomic energy's influence becomes signifi-
cant to our economy and to our way of
life.
The present situation is this. We have
available to us a potential source of heat
energy in atomic fuels which is estimated
as equivalent to 23 times the heat energy
in the world's supply of fossil fuels—-
that is coal, oil, and natural gas. Our
problem is to bring about developments
which will lead us to the area of indus-
trial and civilian utilization of atomic
energy and products.
For practical purposes, we are con-
cerned with the use of the heat energy of
atomic fuels for the production of elec-
tric power.
The four phases of development which
are involved in reaching the goal of in-
dustrial and civil production and utiliza-
tion are:
1. Technical and engineering
2. Economic and commercial
3. Legal and governmental
4. Management and overall accom-
plishment
It is important to note that exceeding-
ly difficult and complex problems are in-
Anne K. Campbell
volved in each of these lines. This article
is concerned with the technical and engi-
neering problems, although it is important
to realize that all four of these lines of
development must progress simultaneous-
ly and be carried to completion or the
goal cannot be reached. The technical and
engineering problems of a workable re-
actor, for example, might be solved, but
if the economic problems which will
make power produced by this reactor com-
petitive so that it may be used in com-
mercial applications are not solved, then
building the reactor could not be justified.
It was stated before that heat energy
from atomic materials is 23 times the heat
energy of the world's fossil fuel resources.
This is based upon information assembled
by the Atomic Energy Commission.
While we here in the United States
have been endowed with fuel resources,
we have been using the more easily recov-
ered deposits at a rapid rate. The same
can be said of petroleum and natural gas,
even though new discoveries are being
made continuously. While we have con-
ventional fuel resources adequate for
perhaps several hundreds of years, their
cost has had a rising trend and has be-
come a matter of concern. The develop-
ment of atomic fuels to supplement fos-
sil fuels should be of great help in stabi-
lizing the situation. It should do much
toward equalizing energy costs, particu-
larly in areas remote from fuel deposits.
In much of Western Europe, the fuel
resources have been largely depleted. In
other areas, such as Brazil and Argen-
tine, no fuel resources have been dis-
covered, and industry is dependent large-
ly upon imported fuels. For these areas,
atomic fuels bring very great promise in-
deed. Atomic fuels therefore are a mat-
ter of real economic importance both here
in the United States and throughout the
world.
Up to the present time it appears that
it is not possible to make a direct conver-
sion from atomic energy to electric en-
ergy. The only practical process at the
present time is the development of heat
during the process of nuclean fission and
using this heat to produce steam which in
turn will be used to drive conventional
steam turbine generators, thus generating
electric power. This is the approach which
is being used by all those engaged in the
effort to utilize atomic fuels.
The technical and engineering prob-
lems of using atomic fuels are insepar-
ably related to the economic and com-
petitive problems. For example, several
types of reactors have been and are being
considered for use in the generation of
electric power. The)' are vastly different
in principle, in technical problems, and
in the use of the potential heat resources
of uranium.
Figure 1 is designed to show how the
uranium is used in three types of reactors.
The value of uranium, $35 per pound is
a nominal figure, used for comparative
purposes only. The actual price might be
either higher or lower than this value.
The non-regenerative reactor shown on
the left of Figure 1 is the simplest type
of reactor. Starting with 100 pounds of
natural uranium, 99.3 pounds of non-
fissionable U-238 would be discarded as
waste in the isotope separation center such
as Oak Ridge. Only 0.7 pounds of fis-
sionable U-235, which incidentally would
have a value of $6,350, would go to the
reactor. One-half of the 0.7 pounds of
U-235 would be fissioned in the reactor to
produce heat and the remaining half
would be discarded as waste. One hun-
dred pounds of natural uranium used in
such a manner would have the heat equiv-
alent of 455 tons of coal, it might produce
910,000 kilowatt hours of electricity, and
12

per kilowatt hour. The non-regenerative
type of reactor would be a single-pur-
pose unit, designed to be used only for
the generation of electric power.
The converter type of reactor shown in
the center of Figure 1 could use natural
uranium. In addition to using all the U-
235 it would convert some of the fertile
U-238 into plutonium, Pu-239, which
would also be used. The overall use of
uranium for operation as illustrated would
still be low, but somewhat better opera-
tion is possible. The converter reactor also
could be made to produce plutonium
both the non-generative and converter
types of reactors presented technical and
engineering problems much less difficult
than those of the fast breeder reactor.
On the other hand, these types would
continually deplete the world's supply of
naturally fissionable materials and make
very ineffective use of the total uranium
resources. It was felt, therefore, that
neither of these reactors is appropriate
for the generation of electric power on a
wide-scale basis. It was concluded that a
fast breeder reactor which would increase
the world's supply of fissionable materials,
rather than deplete it, should be the basis

similar to those at Hanford, Washington,
but there still would be a depletion of
naturally fissionable materials.
The fast breeder reactor, shown at the
right of Figure 1 would provide for the
use of all 100 pounds of uranium. An
initial charge of U-235 (or Pu-239)
would be required to start the unit in
operation. Once operating, however, fer-
tile but non-fissionable U-238 would be
converted or transmutted to fissionable
Pu-239. Part of this Pu-239 would then
be used as the fuel for the reactor and the
remaining Pu-239 could be sold for
weapons materials, or for use in other re-
actors.
No large scale reactor of this type has
even been built, but if operation approach-
ing the type indicated can be achieved,
the 100 pounds of uranium would have
the heat equivalent of 130,000 tons of
coal. Under these circumstances the cost
of heat energy would be only 0.013 mills
per kilowatt hour, a truly negligible
amount.
Perhaps one of the best examples of an
experimental reactor is the Dow-Edison
project. Before undertaking the solution
of the technical and engineering problems
in this project, it was necessary to make
certain decisions concerning the type of
reactor to be used. It was recognized that
of the Dow-Edison effort. The propect is
proceeding with a fast breeder reactor as
the fundamental feature of its design.
In some respects the proposed installa-
tion now being studied by the Dow-Edi-
son group is similar to the Experimental
Breeder Reactor of the Atomic Energy
is used to operate a steam turbine genera-
tor.
In a practical application for commer-
cial power plant use, the breeder reactor
would be very small as compared with a
coal fired steam boiler capable of pro-
ducing a similar amount of heat. The
shaded portion of Figure 2 shows the part
of a coal fired power plant for which nu-
clear reactors might be substituted. This
includes the boilers, coal-handling equip-
ment and auxiliaries required for the pro-
duction of steam. The electric generating
part of the plant, including the turbine-
generators, condensers, and pumps would
remain unchanged.
Figure 3 shows the present conception
of how the same plant might look if nu-
clear heat power reactors were substituted
for the coal-fired boilers.
It is not difficult to imagine some of
the technical and engineering problems
which are involved. Modern steam tur-
bine generators use steam with tempera-
tures up to 1100 F. Obviously, the tem-
peratures in the reactor core must be sub-
stantially higher than the steam tempera-
ture. This temperature requirement im-
poses severe metallurgical problems which
are complicated by the fact that metals
will be exposed to bombardment of neu-
trons and other radioactive materials.
It seems probable at present that steam
temperatures could be used well below
1100 F., at least in the initial develop-
ment. This may not be extremely serious
if the cost of heat energy can be kept as
low as presently seems possible.

Years of Development Behind
New-Model Automobiles
Beauty is more than skin deep in the
new automobiles making debuts this sea-
son.
Beneath their exterior glamour of line
and color lies a different kind of "beauty"
that can be seen in mechanical precision
and strengtli—in the synchronized mo-
tion of pistons, valves and shafts, in gears
transmitting power noiselessly, or in
springs absorbing shock upon shock.

suspension systems, greater driving visi-
bility, and such innovations as power
steering and power braking, in addition
to innumerable detailed mechanical
changes, were offered.
One major manufacturer estimated that
development and retooling costs of bring-
ing out its 1953 models totaled several
hundred millions of dollars. Another put
its new model costs at $200 million, in-
cluding $50 million for a newly designed
engine.

ing, engineering and production of new-

through every mechanical detail. The
automobile is conceived and built as an
integrated precision machine, with out-
side styling and inside engineering in-
extricably tied together.
In the month of January close to half
a million passenger cars were produced
in U. S. plants. Nearly all were 1953
models.
In addition to changes in body styling,
automobile manufacturers introduced an
array of engineering improvements de-
signed to give these new cars greater
durability, safety, comfort, ease of hand-
ling and over-all performance.
There was a general trend in engine
improvement: higher compression ratios
and other changes that provide more per-
formance in relation to fuel consumption,
weight and displacement. Some makes ap-
peared with completely re-designed en-
gines.
New automatic transmission, improved
model automobiles is too big to tell in a
single article or even in a single book.
Each model is a long, complex story in
itself.
But a few general points can be cov-
ered briefly.
To begin with, the creation of a new-
model car amounts to more than a quick
flick of a switch that starts the assembly
lines going.
The high speed with which motor
vehicles are mass produced today tends
to obscure the fact that a great amount of
time still is required to prepare for that
production.
Thousands of carefully planned and
painstakingly executed details go into
automobile design. It takes still more in
time, money and effort to put that design
into production on a volume scale. Elab-
orate new machine tools must be engi-
neered and built, plants must be rearrang-
ed and re-equipped. Orders for purchased
parts and materials must be placed well in
advance to permit suppliers to tool their
plants.
From the time a decision is made to
develop a new model until production be-
gins, the whole process may take two or
more years of time. This is without ac-
counting for possible delays caused by
midway design changes, or by produc-
tion bottlenecks.
Certain innovations introduced in a new
model may have been in process of de-
velopment over many years.
Thus, work started long ago on new-
cars now appearing on the streets and
highways. Likewise, planning already is
underway on future models that will not
be introduced until 1955 or later.
The U. S. automotive industry's tradi-
tional practice of making yearly model
changes provides strong incentive for
engineering progress. Many observers re-
gard it also as a potent force behind the
spectacular growth of the industry and of
highway transportation throughout the na-
tion.
Recently, an automotive engineer said,
"It's our job to make sure that enough
people perform the economic function of
making used cars of new cars to keep the
rest of the people supplied with trans-
portation. We do this by means of the
improvements we build into our new
models each year."
The 43 million passenger cars in use
in America today—one for every 3.8 per-
sons—testify how well engineers and de-
signers have done their job over the years.
No one can say exactly what the first
step is in creating a new model. The pro-
cedure varies from case to case and in-
volves many synchronized activities of a
large, complex organization.
But the work divides roughly into two
principal phases: (1) the development
and perfection of mechanical changes,
based on continuing technological investi-
gations, and (2) the determination of
styling, which includes over-all size, ap-
pearance, comfort, safety, and such detail
as external and internal trim.

Aside from the slide rule, one of the
tools most commonly associated with the
engineering profession is the graph or
chart. In every text book or class room
lecture the student is furnished curves
of relationships, experience or behavior
laws ranging, for example, from the
simple ship model test data of resistance
vs. speed to the complicated grids involv-
ing several variables. The young engineer
also is familiar with many types of plot-
ting techniques and sheets such as recti-
linear, polar, 60 degree, log and semi-log
coordinates, including three-dimensional
presentations. Undergraduate's tasks em-
phasize the use of design charts, nomo-
graphs, minimum and maximum, graphi-
cal integration and differentiation.
An interesting and challenging problem
frequently confronting the engineer or
executive in practice is the reduction of a
mass of observed data, involving numer-
ous variables, into a working chart for
analysis, or future design or planning.
The factors may be costs, engineering
values, or a combination of both, and
when properly depicted can disclose
trends or influences of pertinent import-
ance. The final charts often represent
Louis A. Baier
years of effort rewarded in personal satis-
faction and professional pride.
For estimating purposes, material—by
weight or quantity—is usually well de-
fined as a simple function of physical
characteristics, whence a curve illustrates
the relationship. However, examine, for
example, the recording of paint used on
various projects, where the quantity might
be expected to resolve into a simple func-
tion of surface; i.e., so many square feet
of surface per gallon of paint. Such, of
course, is not the case, since the quantity
used will be affected by the following
conditions: Type of paint; amount of
surface; metal, wood, or canvas surface;
old or new surface; preparation of the
surface; first, second, or third coat; use
of brush or spray; overhead work; flat
surface or trim; temperature; etc.
Labor costs are even less amendable to
predictable functions of units. Many fac-
tors such as location; preparations; size or
volume; scaffolding; available tools; tem-
perature; day of the week; labor-manage-
ment relations or union restrictions; com-
petition; etc., makes any assumption of
cost per item exceedingly uncertain. It is
frequently necessary to use non-dimen-
sional parameters and considerable in-
genuity in order to clearly measure the
effect or influence of numerous factors,
physical or political.
A specific illustration may be of inter-
est and perhaps serve of value in similar
problems when the reader faces respon-
sibility in practice. The Naval Tank is
concluding a three-year program of model
testing for the Corps of Engineers. The
research involved testing for resistance

ed a channel with sides having a slope
of 1 in 2. A list of the variables affecting
resistance include: Speed; size and form
of barge; flotilla combination; water tem-
perature; depth of water; width of chan-
nel; draft of the barge or flotilla; model
surface; and the successful stimulation of
turbulent flow.
The model data from some 3500 runs
originated as faired curves of resistance
plotted on speed in ft. per min. By the
usual application of the Law of Compari-
son the model data were translated into
prototype curves of towrope horsepower
(TRHP) vs. speed in miles per hour
(MPH). In the process the effects of
temperature on viscosity and mass density;
model surface; and turbulent flow were
standardized. All the prototype curves
were assembled on one sheet by the

sponsor and, as might be expected, pro-
duced no more than an historical sum-
mary. The Naval Tank therefore pro-
ceeded to reduce the data through the
following stages into final curves which
were of analytical value.
The first step was to replot curves for
the prototype in terms of Rt/A (total re-
sistance in lbs. per short ton of displace-
ment) vs. Froude's number, V/VgL,
(speed in ft./sec. divided by the square
root of the product of g and barge length
in ft.). In this stage the original TRHP
vs. MPH were reduced to nondimension-
al parameters. Taking each barge or flo-
tilla individually, the effect of water con-
ditions was now reflected as shown on
Graphs 1-5, where a new technique was
introduced which frequently proves ex-
tremely useful. Contours of constant

values of Rt/A are plotted on coordinates
of V/VgL~nnd D/H; where D = depth
of water; H = draft of the barge; B =
beam of the barge, and W = base width
of the water channel; all in feet.
Further progress is shown on Graph 6.
Here Series "A", "B", "C" (run in the
restricted channel) and Series "G" (rep-
resenting unrestricted shoal water data)

sponding deep water results. The curves
are based on D/H (depth over draft) and
are for a common V/x/gL value of
0.100, chosen as an appropriate speed in
the river operating range. The expression

of the channel to the depth of water in
the channel.

need for the change was presented as
dramatically as possible, showing two
identical garments produced in the fac-
tory, one produced in 1946 which had
sold for 100% more than the other, pro-
duced in 1947. The group was asked to
identify the cheaper one but could not do
so. This demonstration effectively shared
with the group the entire problem of the
necessity of cost reduction. A general
agreement was reached that a savings
could be effected by removing the frills
and fancy work from the garment without
affecting the workers opportunity to
achieve a high efficiency rating. Manage-
ment then presented this plan to set the
new job and piece rate:
(1) Make a check study of the job as
it was being done.
(2) Eliminate all unnecessary work.
(3) Train several operators in the cor-
rect method.
(4) Set the piece rate by time studies
on these specially trained opera-
tors.
(5) Explain the new job and rate to
all operators.
(6) Train all operators in the new
method so they can reach a high
rate of production within a short
time.
(Continued from page 11)
They displayed a cooperative and interest-
ed attitude and immediately presented
many good suggestions. This attitude
carried over into the working out of the
details of the new job; and when the
new job and piece rates were set, the
"special" operators referred to the resul-
tants as "our job," "our rate," etc. The
new job and piece rates were presented at
a second group meeting to all the opera-
tors involved. The "special" operators
served to train the other operators on the
new job.
Experimental groups 2 and 3 went
through much the same kind of change
meetings. The groups were smaller than
experimental group 1, and a more inti-
mate atmosphere was established. The
need for a change was once again made
dramatically clear; the same general plan
was presented by the management. How-
ever, since the groups were small, all
operators were chosen as "special" opera-
tors; that is, all operators were to par-
ticipate directly in the designing of the
new jobs, and all operators would be
studied by the time study man. It is in-
teresting to note that in the meeting with
these two groups, suggestions were imme-
diately made in such quantity that the
stenographer had great difficulty in re-
group, when treated like experimental
groups 2 and 3 in another change that
occurred some months later, showed a
productivity record identical to that shown
by experimental groups 2 and 3. (Chart
2).
The largest degree of integration of
psychology and industry can be found in
the field of management—labor relations.
Years ago, when most production was in
shops employing a dozen or fewer men,
it was very easy for employers and em-
ployee to know and understand each
other. Now, with most of our production
in large factories employing hundreds of
men, it is not as easy for management
and labor to have such close contact. As
a result, the two groups have grown bitter
toward each other. To remove this ever-
growing problem, industry is turning to
psychology for help.
By learning how and why individuals
and groups behave as they do under
various conditions, labor and management
can better understand each other's prob-
lems. The research program carried by
Western Electric's Hawthorne Works in
Chicago serves as a good example of this
type of research.
The original purpose of the Hawthorne
experiment was to study the effects on

A NEW RELAY RECORD
Relays — which are high-speed switches — are the
nerve centers of the dial telephone system. In a split
second, they set up a connection and then are off
to direct the next call. In a large city, more than
1000 relays are used every time a number is dialed.
Now a new wire spring relay — devised by the
Bell Laboratories —is at work. With only 11 instead
of 70 parts, it is twice as fast, uses less power, and
costs less to make and maintain than its predecessor.
Result: calls go through faster and switching is done
with less equipment.
Men and women of the Bell System —in oper-
ating, manufacturing and laboratory work —con-
tinually seek new ways to improve telephone service.
Qualified engineering graduates can find well-paid
and interesting careers in the telephone business.
Your placement officer can give you details about
opportunities for employment in the Bell System.

Starting Point for a Great Career!
Within a few weeks Pontiac Motor
Division will be welcoming engineer-
ing graduates from all parts of the
country—young men who have chosen
Pontiac as the starting point for an
engineering career.
Most of them will start out in designing,
for this has been shown to be one of the
most practical ways to engineering suc-
cess. In fact, a recent survey found that a
majority of the top jobs in the auto-
motive industry are now held by men
with broad engineering training—by men
whose basic training was in designing.
But in addition to a splendid opportunity,
Pontiac will also offer these young men
the most efficient facilities in its new
air-conditioned, well-lighted, 200,000
square foot engineering laboratories—
among the industry's most modern, with
every conceivable facility for designing
better and better Pontiacs.
To those engineering graduates who will

DICK CURRY, '54E
Just one hundred years ago next fall,
Alexander Winchell was appointed to set
up the first classes in engineering at the
University of Michigan. To commemor-
ate this anniversary and to celebrate the
century of achievements in engineering
and engineering education, the University
of Michigan is planning a year-long
centennial program.
A two day convocation will inaugurate
the celebration on October 23 and 24.
The convocation is planned mainly as an
alumni gathering, but it will probably
draw the attention of many educators and
industrialists as well. The activities sched-
uled for this program include: an open
house and tours of the engineering labs,
luncheons and banquets at the Union and
the League, prominent speakers in engi-
needing and allied fields, the conferring
of honorary degrees and citations, a pre-
view and tour of the new North Campus,
and the formal dedication of the Cooley
Memorial Laboratory on North Campus.
Prominent alumni and educators in the
engineering field will assist University

engineering students and instructors are
being used as actors in most scenes.
Plans for many other events are being
worked out by a faculty committee, head-
ed by Professor Stephen S. Attwood, and
by an alumni advisory committee. A large
number of engineering society conven-
tions and technical programs are being
scheduled for the Centennial Year. Plans
are also being considered for a student-
faculty convocation ,to take place, prob-
abzly, during the second semester.
The Engineering College is justly
proud of its progress during the past hun-
dred years. It is taking the opportunity of
this anniversary to sponsor a centennial
program which will bring closer together
its faculty, students, alumni, and friends.

to handle them at the other end, it was
announced at a recent symposium on
space travel. It would cost about $250,000
to set up an earth-to-moon-and back com-
munications system.
A meeting, attended by topflight scient-
ists, rocket manufacturers, and electronic
company executives, was held recently in
New York for the purpose of discussing
the possibilities of future space travel. A
majority of the scientists agreed that an
artificial moon could be built 1,075 miles
away from the earth's surface. Some of
them believed that with such a space
planet as an advanced base, rocket flights
to the moon would be possible. Accord-
ing to Dr. Wernher von Braun, director
of a rocket research center, industrial re-
search has reached the point where such
a man-made moon will be established
within 10 years.
Streamlined Drafting
Streamlined industrial drafting is being
used by the General Electric Company as
one means of combating the skilled man-
power shortage.
The more than 5,000 draftsmen em-
ployed by the company are being en-
couraged to strip the frills from their
drawings, thereby saving from 20 to 50
per cent of the time normally required to
prepare drawings.
Substantial savings in other related
operations are expected as a result of the
switch from methods said to be as out-
moded as the horse and buggy.
At the same time, it is anticipated that
the need for additional manpower will be
reduced and more time will be available
for the most important part of any in-
dustrial draftsman's job—the real pro-
ductive effort of creative thinking.
Draftsmen make the drawings from
which manufacturing departments pro-
duce the finished product. Simpler draw-
ings are expected to lessen the time re-
quired to read them and effect a saving
in those departments.
Simplification and elimination of non-
essentials on drawings and layouts is being
done without surrendering either clarity
of presentation or accuracy of dimension,
the engineers reported.
The new ideas on modern industrial
drafting are being presented personally
to all draftsmen in the company, from the
old-timers on the board to the youngest
apprentice. Experts under the company's
drafting services section are going from
department to department with a planned
program and hope to have covered the
entire company by the middle of this year.
Many of the methods taught in simpli-
fied drafting are not entirely new. They
have been advocated for ten or more
years, but only recently were they wrap-
ped up into an attractive program that
was easily presentable and more readily
understood. The manpower shortage gave
impetus to the program. Casting around
for more draftsmen, the question was
raised as to where to find them.
"Largely, help ourselves," was the an-
swer from the manager of the general
technical services section, who is respon-
sible for the recruiting and training of
semi-technical personnel.
He suggested that self-help must come
through analyzing operations and rear-
ranging essential work to remove non-
technical details from the daily tasks of
technical people. Experience shows that
science students, high school graduates or
skilled technicians can be trained to do

many of the details that might be bogging
down top-flight scientists.
It was further urged that designers and
draftsmen drop the outmoded textbook
practices and artistic drawings with their
superfluous lines and use today's stream-
lined industrial drafting techniques to
produce quicker results.
The men working on this simplified
drafting program have found that draft-
ing organizations have been so engrossed
with product design and development
that they have not realized their drafting
practices have lagged behind the general
trend of industrial progress. They see no
reason for yards of drawings when a
few feet will serve the purpose.
In addition to the saving in manpower,
there is a definite saving in the amount
of materials and facilities. In one in-
stance, a drawing which required 57
square feet of drafting paper was replaced
by one with less than 4 square feet with-
out losing clarity or accuracy.

How modern grinding gets the
TOUCH OF GOLD
99
Ever consider how grinding with
exactly the right wheel literally gives
shop men the "Touch of Gold?"
That's because every time a top-
performing grinding wheel touches
the work, value is being added. At the
same time the manufacturer is cutting
costs and increasing profit-margins
. . . while the ultimate purchaser of
the product itself is getting more for
his money.
Norton grinding wheels have top
performance "engineered in." And as
the world's largest producers in the
abrasive field, Norton is always able
to furnish the right abrasive or abra-
sive product for every job — thus sup-
plying countless workers throughout
industry with the true value-adding,
cost-cutting "Touch of Gold."
Your Future with Norton
As industry expands, the demand
for Norton products naturally in-
creases, in a constantly growing list of
grinding, polishing and other abra-
sive applications. A career with
Norton — making better products to
make other products better — offers
The New Norton G Bond. The grinding
wheel this man is using — in a Norton grind-
ing machine — is made with the new Norton
C Bond, one of the most important grinding
wJicel achievements in 45 years. The G Bond
is a special vitrified bond, developed by
Norton research engineers, that gives greatly
improved grinding performance in many
precision and semi-precision jobs — typical
of the "Touch of Gold" that Norton brings
to all grinding.

will find the Norton "Touch of Gold"
an invaluable aid to better production.

drafting paper a year. Under the simpli-
fied plan it is indicated that more than
$60,000 a year may be saved in the cost
of paper.
The drawing which was 57 square feet
in size required eight days of one man's
time while the less than 4 square feet of
drawing required only two days for one
man, a saving of 75 per cent in that case.
Although modern industrial drafting
embraces many economical practices, three
of the easiest and yet most effective which
can be applied immediately to reduce the
time and effort to make drawings are
being encouraged, the company said.
Simplification of delineating, elimina-
tion of non-essentials, and extensive use
of free-hand drawing are being encour-
aged. In the most simple terms, simplifi-
cation of delineation and elimination of
non-essentials means merely eliminating
those things which add nothing to their
accuracy, completeness, or clarity.
Extra views, unnecessary elaboration,
superfluous lines, repetition, and conven-
tional representation instead of symbolism
are but a few examples of work that
never should have been done. The direct
way, the simple way, are encouraged as
the best way.
Exponents of the simplified drafting
program are selling the idea that plan-
ning, production and manufacturing
people are not the least bit interested in
fancy drafting techniques nor beautifully
executed time-consuming layouts. What
they want is complete, concise, accurate
information at the proper time, they said.
If a description will suffice, then a
drawing is not needed and the draftsman
is urged not to draw one. In connection
with this, some General Electric drafting
sections have adopted the slogan, "A
superfluous line is a waste of time."
The draftsmen are being cautioned that
the use of short cuts or abbreviated meth-
ods does not relieve them of their obliga-
tion to draw clearly, legibly and in a
manner easily understood. Simplified
drawing is not a license for careless,
sloppy or indifferent work.
Another modern and time-saving draft-
ing practice which the company's drafts-
men are being urged to use whenever pos-
sible is the extension of free-hand draw-
ing beyond its present narrow limits.
Tests have proved that free-hand draw-
ing, when used judiciously, is both prac-

tical and economical. With all factors
made equal, actual drawing time for the
average draftsman is reduced between
20 and 30 per cent.
Throughout the program, this point is
being stressed—the really important part
of any draftsman's job is thinking—the
picture making part is the least important.
Industrial drawings are only a means of
conveying thoughts to others. Less time
spent on the actual making of the draw-
ings or pictures means more time avail-
able for the real productive effort of crea-
tive thinking.

'Heat Wall' Looms As Next Obstacle
Blocking Man's Domination of Skies
With the "sonic wall" conquered, en-
gineers of America's aircraft industry are
leveling an all-out assault on the latest
obstacle to man's domination of the skies
—the "heat barrier."
Just above where today's planes fly and
just beyond present aircraft speeds are
problems which threaten amazing ad-
vances in the science of flight. Tests have
shown that at some speeds and altitudes
today's planes have materials that would
fuse and pull away—and the pilot inside
would roast like beef on a spit.
The temperature range which newer
and faster planes must face is staggering.
The coldest weather ever recorded in the
United States was the minus 66° register-
ed at Yellowstone Park in 1933 while
the highest was marked up at Death Val-
ley 20 years earlier when the thermo-
meter bounded up to 134°.
Yet, just 40,000 feet above the earth
65° below zero is a normal day. Even at
sea level, the temperature of a jet doing
750 miles per hour increases by 100°
merely from the friction of the air pass-
ing by.
And at 40,000 feet, for example, air
friction on a 1,300 m.p.h. plane would
cause temperature rises of more than
200°. That's higher than the boiling point
of water at that altitude.
Requires Costly Research
These known facts are producing new
technical problems every day which aero-
nautical engineers must solve, in most in-
stances after long and costly research and
development. Jet fuels tend to boil and
steam away in today's modern aircraft;
hydraulic oils rapidly reach a critical tem-
perature; aluminum loses 10$- of its
strength at 200° and then fails rapidly.
The heat inside the pilot's cockpit be-
comes so intense that refrigerating systems
must take the torrid air from the jet en-
gines, cool it off and pump it into the
plane's interior.
One such refrigerating unit—the size
of a man's hand and weighing but five
pounds—has a cooling capacity equiva-
lent to that of 45 home refrigerators.
To combat these varying elements, re-
search engineers of the airframe and en-
gine manufacturers, the Government and
private agencies are conducting a relent-
less drive to find new metals and alloys
and to develop equipment cooling systems
which will withstand aerodynamic heat-
ing.
Aluminum, the old standby of the air-
craft industry, and the new plastics may
soon have to take a back seat and make
way for the discoveries of a dawning
high-speed age.

Things are different—up there!
You would be amazed at the tricks nature plays in the stratosphere
As aviation progress has carried man farther into the upper
air, he has found that nature has many tricks up her sleeve
in the stratosphere. Many things that worked well on the
ground wouldn't do as well, or failed completely, in the
space beyond the clouds. Things are truly different up there.
CARBON BRUSHES ARE AN EXAMPLE-These brushes
are the contact points that carry electricity between mov-
ing and stationary parts of motors and generators. They're
in electric razors, sewing machines, huge diesel locomotives
— and in modern aircraft.
THEY COULDN'T STAND ALTITUDE-Today's high flying
planes require literally hundreds of small electric motors
and many carbon brushes. Here was one of nature's quirks,
for brushes which worked well on the ground and at lower
altitudes couldn't take the thin, dry air of the stratosphere.
They'd spark and quickly disintegrate. And if the brushes
failed, the motors also would fail.
UCC FOUND THE ANSWER-The people of Union Carbide
attacked this problem. Through research they developed
special carbon brushes that worked uniformly well at all
altitudes, making stratosphere flying a practical reality.
OTHER AIDS TO FLYING-Better carbon brushes that keep
motors and generators running, alloy metals that stand the
terrific heat of jet engines, plastic insulation for high-alti-
tude wiring, and oxygen that provides the breath of life in
the upper air —these are but a few of the many UCC prod-
ucts that are helping aviation reach new heights.

In August of 1945 the world suddenly
and unexpectedly became conscious of
atomic fission. And since Hiroshima and
Nagasaki, they have heard a great deal
about atomic power and its energy-pro-
ducing element, Uranium.
The arms race that has been going on
now for about five years has intensified
interest in uranium, and the loss of
Czechoslovakia (and the St. Joachimsthal
uranium mines) in 1948 suddenly
brought into focus the strategic import-
ance of uranium ore deposits.
Since 1948 the principle sources of ore
for the Atomic Energy Commission have
been deposits in the Belgian Congo and,
more recently, deposits along the Eastern
shore of Great Bear Lake in Northern
Canada. However, the distance to the
Belgian Congo and transportation diffi-
culties encountered in Northern Canada
render both of these sources rather vul-
nerable in time of war; so, naturally, the
Atomic Energy Commission would be
very pleased if some good ores were
found within the United States. In keep-
ing with this desire, they have offered a
reward of ten thousand dollars to the man
who finds a workable deposit, and a guar-
anteed price on all the ore the mine pro-
duces.
With the best incentive in the world
(money) to spur them on, prospectors, in-
cluding many raw amateurs, have been
active in nearly every part of the country.
In this section of the country, a good
deal of prospecting is being done in
Northern Michigan and Ontario, and at
least one ore deposit, on the Canadian
shore of Lake Superior, has been dis-
covered.
It seems, from all the literature I have
before me, that "You too can find uran-
ium!" And in reality this is comparatively
true. While it would take an experienced
(and scientifically trained) prospector to
discover most metallic ores, uranium's
radioactive and fluorescent properties
make it a dead giveaway to the amateur
with his Geiger counter and ultra-violet
light. So let's see just what you do have
to know before you start prospecting.
Uranium ores are usually classified as
primary ores, such as pitchblende (largely
U308) and other uraninities, or secondary
ores, such as carnotite (a potassium
BY
CHARLES A. STICKELS, '55ChE
uranyl vanadate.) Although there are
over 100 minerals known to contain
uranium salts, only these two, pitchblende
and carnotite, have been found to have
extractable quantities of uranium. The
mines in Czechoslovakia, the Belgian
Congo, and Canada are all pitchblende
deposits. No pitchblende deposits of any
consequence have been discovered in the
United States, but carnotite has been
mined commercially (though intermittent-
ly) in Colorado since 1896.
Primary uranium ores are generally
found associated with granitic rocks. The
secondary ores (since they are formed
from the primaries by weathering) are
usually found in granitic rocks or in sedi-
mentary deposits of granitic rocks. There-
fore, the logical place to begin ones pros-
pecting would be in regions where gran-
itic rocks or granite pegmatites are com-
mon.
According to the AEC's bulletin on
prospecting for uranium, the best place to
look for uranium is in areas where (1)
uranium has been found before, (2)
where the geologic conditions are similar
to those existing where uranium has been
found before, or (3) where other metals
have been found (especially cobalt, silver,
nickel, bismuth, copper, and vanadium).
Uranium is known to occur in four dif-
ferent types of deposits: Vein deposits,
deposits in semimentary rocks, placer de-
posits, and pegmatic deposits. Pitchblende
is usually found in veins, and the mines
at Great Bear Lake in Canada and in the
Belgian Congo are of this sort of deposit.
Some sedimentary rocks, such as sand-
stone, shales, and phosphates, may con-
tain quantities of uranium minerals. Such
is the case in Colorado where carnotite
deposits occur in beds of standstone.
Since placer deposits have been formed
from water-transported solids (never be-
ing in solution) they are usually quite
impervious to decomposition. But, since
most uranium minerals are not impervious
to decomposition, if they are found in
placers it is usually in conjunction with
some other mineral (usually a thorium
mineral). Uranium occuring in pegma-
tites is usually found in small mineral
pockets, and is not often of such concen-
tration as to warrant commercial opera-
tions.
So much for background. However,
even if a prospector knows where to look
for uranium minerals, he is still faced
with the problem of recognizing the min-
erals when he encounters them. The ama-
teur prospector is assisted over this hurdle
by having several means of locating and
identifying ores other than straight visual
identification. Foremost among these, of
course, is the Geiger counter. The Geiger
counter will measure radioactivity of sur-
face rock outcroppings, but will seldom
detect radioactive materials more than
three feet under the ground. So the ama-
teur prospector is limited, then, to sur-
face searching unless he has access to old
diggings or mines. Since all uranium ores
are radioactive, the Geiger counter will be
sensitive to all of them. Unfortunately, it
is also sensitive to thorium (and some
potassium) ores, not to mention cosmic
rays—all of which can confuse the novice
no end.
So the logical thing to do is to use the
Geiger counter with other means of iden-
tification. One of the simplest means of
positively determining radioactivity uses
ordinary photographic film. A radioactive
sample placed near unexposed film for
from 4 to 48 hours, will produce an
audio-radiograph of itself upon the film.
The more active the sample, the less time
it will take for an exposure.
A radio-active sample can be identified
as uranium by the so-called 'bead test.'
An iron wire with a small loop in one
end is dipped in sodium or lithium fluor-
ide and heated over a flame until a small
molten drop is formed. This 'bead' is
then brought in contact with a pulverized
rock sample, so that one or more particles
of the rock adhere to the bead. After re-
heating the bead until the particles are
fused, the bead is cooled and examined
under ultra-volet light in a dark place.
If any uranium is present the bead will
glow with a bright yellow green.
This same property of fluorescence can
also be used in searching for the ores.
Although some of the primary ores (i.e.
pitchblende) do not fluoresce, many do,
and many of the secondary ores are also
fluorescent. Most of these fluorescent min-
erals are not worthwhile ores, but their
presence at ground level may indicate

level may indicate the existence of sub-surface primary ores,
since secondary ores are formed from the latter.
Other methods of searching and positive identification are
in use, but if Geiger counter search and ultra-violet search are
coupled with even a rudimentary knowledge of what the vari-
ous uranium minerals look like, then a fairly comprehensive
search is possible.
If uranium deposits are discovered, the prospector should
send test samples of his ore to commercial assayers or to a
Government agency, such as the U.S. Geological Survey. If
the ore is found to be of commercial concentrations, it may-
be mined and sold either to the AEC or to some licensed
private firm.
While no major deposits of uranium minerals have been
found in the state of Michigan, prospectors were sent scurrying
to the North Woods in 1948 after the discovery of pitchblende-
calcite veins on Theano Point, 50 miles northwest of Sault Ste.
Marie. Since then geologists have stated that parts of the
Upper Peninsula (particularly the area between Marquette
and Keweenaw Bay) are very similar geologically to Theano
Point, and that the Upper Peninsula is a promising area in
which to search for uranium.
Need I say more? When you leave for that summer vaca-
tion in Upper Michigan, better stick your Geiger counter in
there next to the fishing equipment. Then if the fishing turns
bad, you can dig out your prospecting equipment, and . . .
who knows? . . . maybe you can . . . ten thousand dollars
would sure come in handy.
More detailed information of prospecting can be obtained
from the AEC pamphlet "Prospecting for Uranium" or from
the booklet "You Can Find Uranium" by Weiss and Orlandi.
These publications take up in greater detail the problems of
How to Slake a Claim, where you can legally prospect, and
bow to get that ten grand reward from the government. A
useful guide for identifying uranium minerals is DeMent and

THAD D. EPPS, '53E
Should engineers have more liberal
arts? Ask this simple question of any
group of engineers, and a spirited, multi-
sided discussion is certain to develop.
Some say yes—all they can possibly get.
Others respond with negative finality.
Many reply, "Sounds great, but how?"
Eventually, numerous theories are pre-
sented as to the practicality, feasibility,
and advisability of broader educational
opportunities in engineering colleges.
Realizing the interest and diverse opin-
ions prevalent among the students and
faculty alike here at Michigan, the Engi-
neering College Steering Committee re-
cently sponsored an evening of discussion
based on the topic "Should Engineers
Have More Liberal Arts?" Sixty students
and faculty members proved to be not
only extremely interested in the ramifica-
tions of this subject, but also quite diverse
in their views. While this type of dis-
cussion is not intended to result in any
decisions or plan of action, never the less
a number of conclusions could be drawn
from the remarks of the evening.
The students were almost unanimous
in their desire for a broader knowledge
in the subjects of history, philosophy, po-
litical science, and the like. While the im-
portant fact was presented that the Engi-
neering College is finding it increasingly
difficult to train students in the very
basic engineering subjects in a brief four
years, the need for engineers to have a
casual acquaintance with the so-called lib-
eral arts was admitted by almost all those
present. The question that naturally arose
at this point was, "So engineers may need
some liberal arts. Fine, but how can this
be accomplished?" Upon this point opin-
ion definitely diverged. A prominent
member of the faculty summed up the
present method of gaining this broader
education when, in reply to a student, he
said, "If you want liberal arts, go over to
the Literary College and get them!" He
went on to explain the combined program
whereby engineers may elect more Liter-
ary College subjects than with a "straight"
engineering curriculum. He further re-
marked that any student may select study
in the liberal arts field if he so desires,
providing he is willing to prolong his
education.
Thad D. Epps
Others present voiced their belief that
it was difficult to obtain full educational
value from the liberal arts subjects under
the present system. The smaller number
of non-technical electives given the engi-
neer, coupled with the pre-requisite re-
quirements accompanying many Literary
College courses was cited as one of the
major faults of the present system. Stu-
dents pointed out that most two and three
semester series of courses are out of the
question for the engineer's limited elective
schedule if he wishes to graduate in the
customary four years. And, unless these
courses are all taken in sequence, a well
rounded picture of the subject matter is
impossible. From this discussion evolved
the desire for more one-semester survey
courses that would enable the engineeer-
ing student to grasp the basic and overall
concepts of those fields of study outside
his own.
Another prevalent belief, held by some
faculty and students, was that liberal arts
education for engineers is unnecessary.
These individuals felt that the engineer
could adequately gain a background in
history and similar courses by reading and
studying outside the classroom. They
based this belief on the supposition that
if an engineer were genuinely interested
in a broader education, he would—and
could—gain this on his own, without the
aid of quizes and instructors.
The final view was that more of the
liberal arts type of subjects should be
made a part of the requirements of the
Engineering College. This point of view
was in line with the systems at the Massa-
chusetts Institute of Technology, where
eight semesters of "Humanities" are re-
quired, which seems to include many of
the history and political science courses
desired by many engineers.
Thus, after almost two hours of com-
ments, opinions, and ideas, the students
and faculty left the meeting with many-
new ideas and a new viewpoint on many
ramifications of the topic.
The above resume is not intended to be
a detailed report of the meeting. Nor is it
a comprehensive presentation of the "Lib-
eral Arts and Engineers" problem with
all its possible arguments. The preceding
is, rather, a specific example of the bene-
fits gained by mutual discussion between
the students and faculty of the Engineer-
ing College. The Engineering College
Steering Committee was formed with the
prime purpose of promoting closer con-
tact between the students and the faculty.
Too many engineers spend four years
here at Michigan continually complaining
to each other about certain courses, in-
structors methods, and college policies.
And many times the faculty and adminis-
tration would be very receptive to stu-
dent suggestions concerning improve-
ments in the Engineering College. Our
college should be run for the students,
and—contrary to popular belief—student
opinion is valued by those who administer
the college. But only if students will come
forward with a positive and not a nega-
tive attitude toward improving our col-
lege, will the full value of the student-
faculty cooperation be utilized.
The Steering Committee is a group of
students who are interested in the solu-
tion of the mutual problems of both the
faculty and the students. The Committee
is not "on the side" of either group, but
stands in the middle ready to present the
facts of the problems and help effect a
solution. The committee members feel
that through this mutual exchange of
ideas, the Engineering College of the
University of Michigan will produce

tomorrow is taking shape—test by test, ex-
periment by experiment.
What man will be capable of in years to
come, how he will work and play, how he
will travel, all depend to a large extent on
the fuels and lubricants that will power the
machines of the future.
More than a quarter of a century ago
Standard Oil opened its first automotive
laboratory, and from time to time has en-
larged the facilities.
Now Standard Oil has added still another
unit. The new building located at Whiting,
Indiana, is devoted entirely to the testing
and development of automotive fuels and
lubricants.
Full-scale testing is conducted in a room
containing every needed facility for the
measurement and control of operating con-
ditions. The test engines include the prin-
cipal types used today or anticipated for the
future. Each of 16 engines, with its dynamo-
meter, is mounted on a separate concrete
foundation, isolated from other parts of the
building to eliminate vibration.
In the expansion of our laboratories,
young technical men find evidence that the
challenge of the future, with its stimulation
and rewards, is being met at Standard Oil.

PRODUCTS TO SAVE
MATERIAL AND COST
MOST products can be built stronger,
more rigid with welded steel con-
struction than possible any other way.
Steel is 3 times stronger and twice as
rigid as traditional gray iron. As a result,
usually less than one-third the actual
weight of metal is required.
Pound for pound, steel sells for a third
of what gray iron costs at the cupola. This
lower cost per pound plus fewer pounds
needed to carry equivalent load means
that initial material costs can be cut as
much as 85% of prices charged for cast-
ings alone to which fabrication, of course,
must be added.
In addition to its inherent superior
physical properties, steel is easily formed
to efficient engineering shapes such as I
beams and channels. Thin wall structural
sections are possible by concentrating
material at outer edges in load carrying
members where each pound of metal does
the most good. When steel is utilized to
the fullest, a product of welded construc-
tion generally can be manufactured for
half the cost.
The examples show how a typical ma-
chine part was changed over from cast
iron to welded steel construction. The
cost saving of 50% resulted from less
material and expense by eliminating sev-
eral machining operations such as mill-
ing and drilling. Cleaning and painting
operations in the former cast design were
also avoided. The new welded steel base
is both stronger, more rigid and has a
clean streamlined appearance to improve
selling appeal.

tures to save steel and lower cost is pre-

of protective water under which the
source is kept. When the room is darken-
ed, the tank and the surrounding area are
illuminated by this glow.
According to Dr. Kenneth H. Kingdon,
technical manager of the laboratory, the
source consists of about 2.5 pounds of a
radio-active form of the metal cobalt,
known as cobalt 60. The radiations emit-
ted are gamma rays or high-energy X rays.
The laboratory will use the new in-
stallation in connection with its work on
the design and construction of a full-scale,
land-based model of an atomic power
plant for U. S. Navy submarines. Dr.
Kingdon explained.
Physical properties of many materials
to be used in constructing such a plant
may be altered by the powerful rays gen-
erated in the atomic reactor, or "furnace."
By lowering samples of these materials
into the water, and exposing them to rays
from the cobalt 60, such effects may be
tested on a small scale, he said. Other test-
ing of the effects of irradiation on ma-
terials is done in nuclear reactors.
Common glass is one material that is
markedly changed by the rays; it turns a
deep brown. One engineering assistant at
the laboratory took advantage of this to
make a pair of sunglasses, by exposing an
ordinary pair of glasses to the rays over-
night. Such coloration of glass, however,
is not permanent, but gradually fades out.
Baking at a relatively high temperature
very quickly restores the glass to its orig-
inal clarity.
The radioactive cobalt is contained in
ten cylindrical capsules, mounted in holes
in a steel plate. They are kept at the
bottom of a concrete pit and, with the aid
of submerged lights, may be clearly seen
through the nine feet of water covering
them. Remote control devices permit them
to be handled at a distance if necessary,
and allow test samples to be placed in
position around them.
Ordinary cobalt, a metal closely re-
sembling nickel and not radioactive, may
be made radioactive when it is placed in
an atomic reactor and bombarded with
particles called neutrons, Dr. Kingdon
said.
The ordinary form, or isotope, of co-
balt is known as cobalt 59, because there
are 59 particles in each atomic nucleus.
When it is bombarded with neutrons, one
neutron may stick, thus converting the
isotope to the heavier cobalt 60, which is
radioactive. After 5.3 years, half of a
given amount of cobalt 60 changes into an
isotope of ordinary nickel, and gamma
rays are given off as the process takes
place.
The cobalt 60 source was purchased by
the laboratory, at a cost of approximately
$20,000, through the AEC Isotopes Divi-
sion at Oak Ridge, Tenn. This is the
central clearing house for radioactive iso-
topes prepared in U. S. atomic reactors.
Cobalt 60 has also been made available
by the AEC as a source of radiation to be
used by physicians in treating cancer, and
the General Electric X-Ray Department
has produced a unit in which it may be
safely used. Such sources, however, are
less than a third as large as the new one
in the Knolls laboratory. Radioactivity is
measured in units called curies (after
Madame Curie, the discoverer of radium).
Dr. Kingdon said. The new laboratory
source is rated at 3400 curies, compared
with 1000 curies for the medical units.
He said that the glow produced in the
water by the cobalt is called "Cerenkov"
radiation, after its discoverer, a Russian
physicist, and is due to an interaction be-
tween the gamma rays and the atoms of
which the water is made.
Actually, about 50 watts of energy is
being constantly transmitted from the co-
balt into the water, although it does not
all appear as visible light, Dr. Kingdon
said.
Jet Streams
By carefully co-ordinated observation
of cloud formations, weather stations
across the country could establish the lo-
cation and direction of the jet stream, a
mysterious wind tunnel in the sky, ac-
cording to a famed General Electric Com-
pany weather scientist.
At a meeting of American Meteroro-
logical Society, Dr. Vincent J. Schaefer
said that four "specific and rather spec-
tacular cloud types" are visual keys to the
whereabouts of this high-speed stream
that often doubles the speed of high-fly-
ing aircraft.
Field research he directed last summer
as scientific adviser for the Munitalp
Foundation, now sponsoring basic re-
search in meteorology, showed Dr. Schae-
fer that any three of the four tell-tale
cloud formations, plus high cloud speeds
and "coherent" patterns, may be used to

It is felt, however, that progress is be-
ing made in solving these problems. It
is hoped that the proposed design of the
Dow-Edison project will be substantially
completed by the end of 1953. This does
not mean that development will be com-
plete but rather that many technical prob-
lems will have been explored and many
engineering decisions concerning possible-
ways of solving these problems will have-
been formed. The Dow-Edison group
should then be able to consider the actual
design, construction and test of a commer-
cial sized installation.
Through the efforts of interested groups
and individuals, atomic energy is becom-
ing an important segment in the indus-
trial and civilian economy of our country
and of the world. Though the process of
development is slow, atomic energy will
in the future assume its proper role in
peace-time activity.

On numerous occasions during the past few months, the
Steering Committee members have presented to various col-
lege officials and faculty one of the common "gripes" of the

While taking the course, two engi-
neers developed a revolutionary new
circuit breaker mechanism.
"Our experience shows what can happen
if you work with people open to sugges-
tion. We found men of this kind at Allis-
Chalmers, and it has given us a special
pleasure in our job.
"We started out like most other graduates
with a hazy idea of what we wanted to do.
After working in several departments, we
requested that part of our training be at
the Boston Works of Allis-Chalmers,
where circuit breakers are made."
New Design Principle
"Circuit breakers soon became an obses-
sion with us, and we got the idea of de-
signing a hydraulic operator and trigger-
ing mechanism for these breakers. Most
operators for big breakers are pneumatic.
"Unsuccessful attempts had been made
in the past by all circuit breaker manu-
facturers to build hydraulic operators.
Low-pressure spindle for a 120,000 kw
steam turbine generator. Said to be one
of the largest ever built in the United
States, this spindle is nearing completion
in the Allis-Chalmers West Allis shops.
The important thing is that no one at
Allis-Chalmers said, 'Don't try it—it won't
work.'"
Start New Era
"To make a long story short, our study of
the problem led us to the hydraulic accu-
mulator and high speed valves being used
by the aircraft industry. These had not
been available when earlier attempts were
made to build a hydraulic operator. With
these highly developed devices to work
with, we were able to build an operator
that combined the best features of pneu-
matic and hydraulic operation. We call it
the Pneu-draulic operator. Engineers are
saying it starts a new era in circuit breaker
actuation.
"This fact is important to us, but it is
even more important to know that Allis-
Chalmers Graduate Training Course is
full of opportunity . . . and as we found
out, there's opportunity right from the
start."

winds.
At present it takes fairly complicated
upper air soundings to locate this skein
of winds that blows at speeds of from 80
to more than 200 miles an hour at alti-
tudes of 20,000 to 50,000 feet. The
stream moves at slower speeds at lower
altitudes.
Dr. Schaefer listed the four basic cloud
formations as:
Cirrus streamers, white feathery wisps
to cirrus streamers with delicate wave
patterns. They often take on tints of
green and red near the sun.
Altocumulus, fleecy, nearly stationary
formations with lens-shaped clouds, piled
layer upon layer at middle altitudes
(about 20,000 feet). These clouds change
rapidly, especially when sending snow in
long streamers down wind. Such streamers
are evidence of the high-speed movement
of the air. Some of these formations also
are tinted near the sun.
of the major axis of the stream include:
Gustiness at ground level in about half
the cases observed; persistent cool, crisp
air; generally blue skies, with visibility
unlimited; precipitation often limited to
"sporadic sprinkles of rain or snow," and
rapid changes in cloud cover, from one-
tenth of the sky to nine-tenths and back
again "in less than an hour."
Quick identification of this phenom-
enon is becoming increasingly vital to
aviation and also to weather forecasting,
he reported.
Studies made by Dr. Schaefer and other
scientists show that the jet stream shifts
about over the northern hemisphere as the
seasons change.
"Sometimes two or more streams may
be identified," Dr. Schaefer said.
In summer the stream throttles down to
about half of its tremendous wintertime
speeds.
The rocket-like air corridor is blamed
for many freak weather conditions be-
lieved caused when its undulating path
carries polar air to Florida and tropical
air masses to the north. Many floods,
droughts and persistent cold and hot
spells are attributed to its influence.

varying conditions without disrupting the
work in the rest of the plant.
After considerable investigation, it was
found that varying the stated conditions
didn't produce the expected results. In-
stead of production dropping when rest
periods were shortened, it continued to
rise.
Further study showed that a more fav-
orable work attitude had developed in the
experiment. There was increased coopera-
tion between workers and absenteeism
dropped. Because an observer was in
charge of the experimental room instead
of a supervisor, the employees felt freer.
From this project and later similar
projects, it was found that the quality and
quantity of work done by a group de-
pended very much on the type of super-
vision under which they worked. This
was true for all men, from the president
to the most menial worker. For example,
supervisors of high producing groups
give less exacting orders than supervisors
of low producing groups. In this way,
the worker gains some satisfaction from

having decided how to do the job for
himself.
Another finding was that when super-
visors applied principles of group partici-
pation, the work group achieved high
standards of quality and quantity in their
word. There have been many other prin-
ciples discovered; however, it would serve
no useful purpose to mention them all
here.
As you can see, there have been many
ways in which industry has been applying
psychological principles. To engineering
students, the most important application
of psychology in industry is leadership
selection and development. A few years
ago, industry's choice of personnel from
college graduates was based almost en-
tirely on the scholastic records of the
graduates. Today, with industry's greater
use of psychology, the demands made of
engineering graduates have changed. No
longer is it necessary for a graduate to
prove only that he can integrate and de-
sign machines. In addition to the grad-
uate's technological abilities, he must also

If you, as an undergraduate, do not
think that your present course of instruc-
tion will prepare you adequately to ful-

It is not necessary for engineers to also be

expected. What is necessary is that engi-
neers have a firm understanding of the
principles of human behavior. Having
prepared himself in this manner, the engi-

needs of industry.
THE DESIGNERS
The designer bent across his board,
Wonderful things in his head were stored.
And he said as he rubbed his throbbing
bean,
"How can I make this tough to machine?"
"If this part here were only straight
I'm sure the thing would work first rate,
But t'would be so easy to turn and bore,
It never would make the machinists sore.

Then watch those babies tear their hair.
Now I'll put the holes that hold the cap,
Way down in here where they're hard to

"Now this piece won't work, I'll bet a
buck,
But it can't be held in a shoe or chuck.
It can't be drilled or it can't be ground,
In fact the design is exceedingly sound."
He looked again and cried: "At last—
Success is mine; it can't even be cast."

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Machine Design is an important part of Mechanical Engineering. The tremendous in-
dustrial progress being made today is in a large part due to the skill and ingenuity of
the men who design the intricate and complex machinery required. It is difficult today
to find a manufactured article which has not been at least partially processed by ma-
chines, or intended to be part of a machine, hence the effect of the machine designers
has been widespread indeed. As our industrial and economic systems continue to ex-
pand, the job of the machine designer will become even more important.
The Machine Design courses of the College of Engineering are intended to introduce the
students to the fundamental ideas of designing, as well as to provide some actual prac-
tice in this work. Course offerings cover a large field, from general machinery design to
such specialized items as gas turbines and machine tools. The knowledge and training
gained in this work is useful in almost all phases of Mechanical Engineering, as well as
Sales, Production and other related fields.

Insistence on slide rule logic is the biggest obstacle
today facing engineers seeking advancement to in-
dustry's top executive positions. This is neither a
sentence from a freshman engineer's English paper
nor a statement presented at the recent meeting of the
Engineering Steering Committee. Rather, it is the sub-
ject of a speech given by Mr. Robert F. Pearse at the
American Society of Mechanical Engineer's annual
Engineering-Management Conference in Detroit.
Mr. Pearse is not the first person to make this state-
ment, nor will he be the last. Again and again, from
coast to coast, America's industrial leadership is de-
manding that engineers must further enrich their in-
tellectual wealth outside of pure technical subjects.
After four years exposure to the very systematic
approach to engineering problems, most students are
capable of comprehending any problem which can
be solved with the aid of a slide rule and hand
book. The thing which most engineering students
are not capable of doing is appreciating the non-
technical aspects which often are involved in many of
their problems. In many problems, factors such as
economic conditions, political power and social stand-
ards are very effective. If the engineer cannot recog-
nize the value of such factors, his decisions will be
worth very little.
If the engineer is to retain his share of public lead-
ership, something must be done to make him more
conscious than he is now of the problems which will
face him as he tries to get ahead in the world.
Now is the time and in our colleges and universi-
ties is the place. No other part of our educational
system can more efficiently perform this service. Since
most schools already offer courses in economics, po-
litical science, sociology, psychology and other liberal
arts to some of their students, it should take very little
added effort to make these courses available to engi-
neers. It is not necessary to make selection of these
"culture courses" compulsory but only that they be
made easier to fit into engineers programs.
In opposition to such a change in the engineer's
program, some people declare that the knowledge
gained from "culture courses" can be gotten just as
easily by reading the proper books if a person feels so
inclined. It is very true that books can furnish practi-
cally all the facts a person wants but the engineer's
reason for taking liberal art courses is not to just ab-
sorb a lot of facts. What is more important is that he,
in his liberal arts, develops a type of reasoning which
his technical courses do not offer. This background
can only be gotten through contacts and discussions
with other people studying the same material.
In concluding, let me refer you to another point by
Mr. Pearse which very well sums up this discussion.
He said that when the slide rule on the engineer's
desk is teamed with an understanding of personality
traits influencing people, engineers can and do make
excellent leaders.

OCTOBER, 1953


IN the early days of the develop-
ment of coil springs for front sus-
pensions of automobiles, the only
steel that was available was an ordi-
nary hot-rolled bar from which as
much as .035" of metal per side had
to be removed by grinding to insure
freedom from harmful seams, pits,
and decarburization. This cost
money, was wasteful and time con-
suming.
We at United States Steel felt
there was a better way of doing this,
so we put our best engineers on the
problem.
Using a mill especially equipped
for the purpose, they devised an in-
genious method of producing hot-
rolled bars to eliminate harmful de-
fects and most of the grinding ex-
pense. Rolled by this method to half
the standard tolerances, with half
or less the amount of decarburiza-
tion, these Carilloy Precision
Rolled Coil Spring Rounds can be
used "as furnished" or with only a
small amount of centerless grinding.
This exclusive development has
paid off in two ways. It has paid off
for the automobile manufacturer in
that his costs are reduced and spring
performance is of the highest order.
And it has paid off for us because
these Carilloy Precision Rolled
Coil Spring Rounds are now used in
over half of the coil springs in new
automobiles.
Here's just one more example
of the better steel products being
developed by United States Steel's
vast research program. To keep pace
with the ever-increasing demand for
special steel, United States Steel is
always looking for young men with
exceptional ability and training in
metallurgy, engineering and related
fields. For more information, write

Room 2816-C, 525 William Penn
Place, Pittsburgh 30, Pennsylvania.
0 Here, at Muehlhausen Spring Division of
Standard Steel Spring Co., precision-rolled
U-S-S Carilloy Spring Rounds are coiled
without centerleas grinding. Carilloy Rounds
have minimum decarburization, and they cost
less to use.
• At the Oary Works of United States Steel,
this precision mill rolls Carilloy Coil Spring
Rounds with extreme accuracy. Tolerances are
half of standard: .004' on the diameter, in-
stead of the usual .008', and only .006' out
of round, compared to .012' on ordinary rolled
bars.

QSynthane] — making bigger poyloads pay off
Synthane bushings, spacers, and bearings
in the landing gear of this giant of the
skies share the landing shock loads
of twenty-five tons. But Synthane parts
have many virtues in addition to their
ability to withstand the jolts of heavy
landings.
Parts made of this hard-working lam-
inated plastic are unaffected by oils, and
are dimensionally stable. They resist
abrasion, and weigh half as much as
aluminum.
Because Synthane is so easy to machine,
it is appropriate for fair-leads and cable-
sheaves in control systems. Because it is
an excellent electrical insulator, you will
find it at work in engine ignition systems,
flight instruments, automatic controls,
and radar sets. Because Synthane is light
and corrosion-resistant, it's used for the
flapper valves in fuel cell baffles.
Synthane has all these properties and
many more. It might be a good material
for you to try. Start by sending for the

If you're going into industry, one of your most difficult
tasks faces you in the next few months. You'll have
to distinguish between progressive companies and
stand-stills. One way is to consider the pioneering
each is doing.
How much does this company you might join
plan its juture?
How much does it care about society in general?
The cattle in the picture, for instance, are at Republic's
experimental farm. They are part of a study to deter-
mine how much extra grass, hence extra meat, can be
produced by irrigation. The purpose of the experiment
is to prove the benefit of converting worn-out crop
land to profitable grazing area.
The economic reasons for Republic's experiment
are that animals must be fenced and Republic makes
steel farm fence; also that irrigation requires pipe and
Republic makes steel irrigation pipe. But beyond this
immediate commercial aspect, Republic's experimental
farm has a goal reaching far into the future.
Republic Steel's policy is based on a deep realization
that no economic or social section of a nation can long
progress at the expense of others. Progress must be
mutual and industry has a responsibility to do for its
customers as well as to sell to them. This, we believe,
is an enlightened approach to economics which will
promote the continuing welfare of all.
We hope such research programs, of which our farm
experiments are only one example, will catalog
Republic in your mind as a progressive, forward-
thinking company.

BY
DEAN GEORGE GRANGER BROWN
The first announcement of a course in
engineering at the University appeared in
the catalog published at the end of the
year 1852-53, in the form of a new scien-
tific course including Civil Engineering in
the third and fourth years. Having an-
nounced these courses in Civil Engineer-
ing, President Tappan was then faced
with the responsibility of finding a com-
petent teacher.
At that time the availability of engi-
neers, competent by training and experi-
ence to undertake this assignment was
probably extremely limited. President
Tappan followed his announced policy:
"There is no safe guide in the appoint-
ment of professors save in the qualifica-
tions of the candidates," and appointed
Alexander Winchell Professor of Physics
and Civil Engineering in 1853. Winchell
was born in Duchess County, New York,
December 31, 1824. He graduated with a
Bachelor of Arts from Wesleyan Univer-
sity in 1847, having defrayed the cost of
most of his education by teaching school.
He taught science for one year at Pen-
nington Seminary in New Jersey, two
years in Amenia Seminary, New York,
and three years in Alabama. As an experi-
enced teacher of Science, he established
the scientific background of engineering
education which has remained as an out-
standing characteristic of our engineering
programs.
He had extreme difficulty in his travels
to Ann Arbor and arrived on January
14th, Saturday, after having resorted to
almost every means of known transporta-
tion except dog sled in coming from Ala-
bama.
The first classes met by the new profes-
sor of Civil Engineering on January 20,
1854 were:
"Parker's Aids" at 11:00 a.m.
Surveying at 1:30 p.m.
The courses designated as "Parker's
Aids" has created considerable uncertainty
until Mr. Graff of the News Service,
recognizing that the professors of that
time frequently designated their courses
by an abbreviation of the name of the text
used, found copies of old texts written by
Parker and particularly one entitled "Aids
to English Composition." The recognition
of the importance of effective writing as
a necessary skill of the engineer is as
true and important today as it was one
hundred years ago.
We have a fair idea of what is meant
by Surveying although it may be some-
what difficult to conceive how practical
the instruction would have been at that
time since no surveying instruments were
available to Professor Winchell or his
class until May of the following year
when he went to New York to purchase a
"Suite of Instruments." No text is men-
tioned. On January 27, Winchell wrote in
his diary "I am projecting a course of
Lectures in Civil Engineering to be de-
livered next term" and on February 10,
"I have finished (writing) my first lecture
on Civil Engineering. It is designed as
introductory. It is twenty-one pages long
and requires about half an hour to read
it." Winchell had to prepare his own ma-
terial in the field of Civil Engineering.
He gave examinations to his classes in
"Parker's Aids" and Surveying on March
29 and started the second semester on
March 31. During the second semester a
sophomore course in Mechanics (Physics)
was included in Winchell's program
along with the course in Civil Engineer-
ing. Under date of June 23 he wrote:
"We are approaching the close of another
term and of the year. My own examina-
tions are finished. I examined a portion of
the seniors in Civil Engineering day be-
fore yesterday and the sophomores in
Mechanics yesterday. Civil Engineering,
having been a voluntary study thus far
and the seniors being latterly very much
occupied with their commencement ad-
dresses, their examinations in Civil Engi-
neering did not give me much satisfac-
tion."
Winchell continued his teaching of
Engineering, proposing to add Metallurgy
and Mining to the Civil Engineering
course in October and was still working
on his Civil Engineering notes in March
of 1855 and indicated that he "may turn
out a book." The lack of adequate texts is
emphasized by his note of June 10, 1855:
"Have labored much in Physics and Civil
Engineering. Given classes much new ma-
terial not in their books. Collected enough
for a book." In the summer of 1855, he
made a survey for a railroad which was
to run from Ann Arbor to Jonesville and
recorded on September 23: "This I expect
will conclude my practice in the business
of Civil Engineering. I have earned in this
job at $5.00 a day, $70.00. The business
is hard and responsible but not un-
pleasant."
This was the opinion of Winchell, edu-
cated in a Bachelor of Arts program after
teaching Science for six years and teach-
ing and practicing engineering for a
period of less than two years. Engineering
will be similarly characterized by many
men who have had much more experience
in engineering than did Winchell. He
transferred to Professorship of Geology
and Natural History in the Fall of 1855
and continued his work in mathematics,
physics, astronomy and other philosophi-
cal studies with world renown.
The first description of the curriculum
leading to the degree of Civil Engineering
appeared in the catalog for 1855-56 and
included Mathematics, Graphics, Physics,
Natural Science, Elements of Astronomy,
Language, Philosophy and the following
engineering courses presumably offered
in the third and fourth years: Plane Geo-
detics, Railroad and Mining Surveying,
Leveling, Nature and Strength of Ma-
terials, Theory of Construction, Architec-
ture, Machines (particularly the steam
engine and locomotive) and Motors (par-
ticularly steam and water). The catalog
stated: "The entire course can be accom-
plished by the industrious student in four
years, but a longer time may be occupied
upon it with advantage and profit . . .
The studies pursued in the first three years
are identical with those of the correspond-
ing course for the degree of Bachelor of
Science, and are pursued in the same
classes. The fourth year embraces the re-
maining portions."

fessor Winchell for two years, going to
Columbia, New York, in 1857.
DeVoIson Wood, born at Smyrna, New
York, in 1832, graduated as a Civil Engi-
neer from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute
in 1857. Similarly to Professor Winchell,
Wood had taught school both while at-
tending Albany Normal School and Rens-
selaer Polytechnic Institute. In August,
after graduating, he immediately set out
for Chicago where he heard there was a
teaching vacancy. He reached Detroit with
no funds to travel farther and leaving his
baggage, walked to Ann Arbor. He intro-
duced himself to President Tappan, and
as Professor Peck had not returned, was
asked to substitute for a few days. When
Peck resigned, Wood was appointed in
his place. He possessed extraordinary
abilities as a mathematician and an an-
alyst and a genius for teaching. The
peculiar merit of his teaching lay in his
capacity to make men think for them-
selves. Wood proposed a Department of
Engineering with a four year curriculum.
This was adopted in 1858. Land Survey-
ing was started in the sophomore class
and continued for nine weeks when the
class took up Geometric Drawing, Tinting
and Shading. Descriptive Geometry was a
sophomore course. Drawing was con-
tinued into the junior year when Shop
Work was introduced along with lectures
in Machinery and Machine Construction.
The seniors studied the construction of
roads and railroads.
Since the subject of making earthen or
common roads had received little atten-
tion from the scientific world, the Regents
approved in I860 a study to determine
the best conditions and methods for con-
structing earthen roads.
Classes at that time were given in the
old South Wing of Old University Hall
in rooms which had been formerly used
for student dormitories. Heating was by
wood stoves, stoked by the professor or by
an obliging student with wood from large
wood boxes filled daily by "Jimmy"
Ottley.
Wood continued during the sixties to
do practically all of the teaching as Pro-
fessor of Civil Engineering. He resigned
in 1872 to accept a similar position in
Stevens Institute of Technology at Hobo-
ken. He was a member of the American
Society of Civil Engineers, The American
Society of Mechanical Engineers, The
American Association for the Advance-
ment of Science, and the first President
for the Society for the Promotion of Engi-
neering Education. He died in New York
City, June 27, 1897, and is buried at
Forest Hill in Ann Arbor.
By 1895, when the Department of En-
gineering was established as a separate
school or college, we find that "the pre-
scribed work in French and German has
been reduced to fifteen hours." English
and Rhetoric consisted of two courses in
"Paragraph Writing." Plane Trigonom-
etry was required for admission and had
to be taken without credit if the entering
student had not passed a satisfactory ex-
amination. Required Mathematics covered
five semesters including Calculus and
Mechanics. The requirements in Physical
and General Chemistry were also very
similar to those in effect at the present
time. The courses in engineering empha-
sized Shop Practice, Machinery, Drawing
and Construction.
In 1931, the prescribed work in French
and German had been reduced to zero,
there was less emphasis on Shop Practice
and more on non-technical electives.
Adequate text books were available for
most undergraduate courses, but the prac-
tice of continuous introduction of new
modern material in all engineering
courses, started with Alexander Winchell,
has been continued throughout the cen-
tury as this is the only way of keeping
the courses in conformity with modern
knowledge and practice. This demands
continuous effort on the part of both stu-
dent and teacher as well as the practicing
engineer. The expanding field of Engi-
neering creates a continuous and difficult
problem which was recognized and clearly
stated by Professor Wood 95 years ago.
He asked "Should the entire (engineer-
ing) course be included, in point of time
with the present undergraduate course of
four years, or should a fifth or University
year be added to complete the course?"
The medical schools and the lav
schools, which admitted students with
less than a high school preparation and
seldom ran more than a few months of
classes one hundred years ago, have de-
cided to meet the expanding requirements
of their professions by greatly increasing
the length of their programs. Most engi-
neering colleges have continued the four
year basic program following it with ad-
vanced post-graduate work for those stu-
dents who desire the specialized, inten-
sive work in such programs.
These differences in the educational
programs have probably contributed in
part to the different activities of the vari-
ous professional graduates. What is de-
sired in engineering, an intensive special-
ized educational program of a smaller
group of elite, or a flexible education of a
larger mass of the eligible? The engineer-
ing curriculum has changed considerably
in emphasis in the last 100 years, but it
remains a four year curriculum based on
mathematics and science, plus adequate
skill in language and an appreciation of
human and economic factors. This is not
easy and many employers seek engineering
graduates not primarily because of their
particular technical skills, but because
"engineers know how to work."
Engineering education at the University
has been and still is a challenging and
exacting program for both faculty and
students. These conditions will continue.
The Engineering curriculum of the future
will continue to be just as exacting as it
has been in the past. The emphasis will
probably change. I expect that the tre-
mendous changes in the Engineering con-
tent of the undergraduate programs which
have taken place in the last 100 years,
may now be followed by important
changes in the scientific stem of engineer-
ing curricula which has remained sub-
stantially constant in the undergraduate
programs of Engineering for nearly a
century.
It is frequently stated that the first hun-
dred years are the hardest. The first hun-
dred years were hard, but not necessarily
the hardest.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


It was just a century ago, in 1853, that
Alexander Winchell came to the Univer-
sity of Michigan to take over the teach-
ing of Civil Engineering and Physics.
This step marked the beginning of engi-
neering at Michigan. Following this there
have been a hundred years of develop-
ment as the college has progressed along
side the industrial growth of the nation.
The true founder of engineering edu-
cation at the University, however, was
not Winchell but Professor de Volson
Wood. In 1858 the first Department of
Engineering was set up under Wood. In
I860 the first Civil Engineering degrees
for a four year undergraduate course were
awarded to Frank L. Krause and William
Minto. Wood himself did most of the
teaching for the next ten years. He de-
veloped courses concerning hydraulics,
construction of bridges, resistance of ma-
terials, and water distribution. Other
courses of importance dealt with road con-
struction, grading, and drainage. Shop in-
struction and the study of machines were
also offered.
During those early days classes were
held in the South Wing of University
Hall in rooms which were formerly used
as student dormitories. The rooms were
heated by stoves stoked with wood either
by professors or students. The water sys-
tem consisted of an old zinc pail which
was refilled from time to time. Civil Engi-
neering and Mining Engineering were of
major importance. Mechanical Engineer-
ing was recognized in 1868. Later on
much attention was devoted to courses in
architecture.
Professor Wood resigned from his po-
sition in 1872. Engineering at Michigan
for the next thirty years was guided by
three men, Charles Ezra Greene, Joseph
Baker Davis, and Charles Simeon Deni-
son. The plaques on the walls of the tra-
ditional Denison Arch were placed there
in honor of their excellent service.
The last quarter of the nineteenth cen-
tury saw the addition of the Departments
of Electrical and Marine Engineering. In
1895 the Department of Engineering be-
came the College of Engineering under
the Deanship of Charles Greene. There
had always been opposition to the estab-
lishment of a separate college because of
a fear that the technical student might
Engineering Laboratories. 1885
become too technical, that he might lose
the values of a broad education. Until
this time the engineering program had
been offered within the Literary College.
In 1902 the cornerstone was laid for
the West Engineering Building. In that
same year enrollment climbed to 609 as
compared with 62 in 1872. Two years
later M. E. Cooley became Dean. Under
his leadership the school acquired wide-
spread international recognition. The De-
partments of Chemical Engineering,
Aeronautical Engineering, and Engineer-
ing Mechanics were all added after the
turn of the century. In the academic year
of 1909-1910 enrollment figures reached
2000. Housing, which had always been a
major problem, now became more im-
portant than ever. By 1923, however, East
Engineering Building was completed and
this alleviated much of the difficulty .
The policy of allowing University men
to engage in outside work was firmly es-
tablished in 1910. The idea was that the
University would be better able to attract
men of greater ability who would be per-
mitted to engage in collateral practice so
long as it did not interfere with their
University work. This policy has stood
until the present day and was the origi-
nating factor in the establishment of the
Department of Engineering Research set
up in 1920. Now called the Engineering
Research Institute, this organization made
it possible for the college to offer its
special services in research to both indus-
try and the government. The availability
of research facilities also led to an ever
increasing interest in postgraduate work
within the College of Engineering.
Between 1941 and 1945 Professor
R. H. Sherlock acted as coordinator of
the training of more than 12000 persons
for work in industry under the Engineer-
ing, Science, and Management War Train-
ing Program. After World War II return-
ing veterans brought about a tremendous
increase in enrollment figures which then
reached a peak of about 5000.
Today the Engineering College stands
as a monument to a century of develop-
ment. It has come a long way since Alex-
ander Winchell taught his first class in
Civil Engineering. In its early years engi-
neering training within the Literary Col-
lege was molded by scientists whose goal
was to provide enough civil engineers at a
time when rapid population growth
brought about a great demand for them.
Later on engineers themselves took a
greater part in education. Courses became
practical as well as scientific. Laboratory
instruction was developed to provide bet-
ter technical training. Despite the fact
that the college has been separated from
(Continued on page 34)

From humble beginnings has developed
one of the most renowned engineering
colleges in the world; from Alexander
Winchell's one class in civil engineering
has grown the University of Michigan
College of Engineering.
The buildings on campus are only a
jumping-off point for the far-flung net-
work of activity in which the Michigan
engineer engages. Here he receives his
basic training—his math, physics, and
chemistry—and moves on to specialized
training.
The catalogue of the College of Engi-
neering lists thirteen divisions of spec-
ialized training, including some divisions,
such as Materials Engineering and Nu-
clear Engineering, which were recently
created to keep pace with changes in in-
dustry. The laboratories and equipment of
each of these departments graphically il-
lustrate the century of progress in engi-
neering at Michigan.
The Aeronautical Department met the
demands of the era of flight with the most
modern equipment for the design, con-
struction, and testing of aircraft—two
subsonic wind tunnels, a supersonic wind
tunnel, a supersonic jet, and structures,
propulsion, and instrumentation labora-
tories. Housed in the north wing of East
Engineering Building are the various
laboratories of the Chemical Engineering
Department including process operations,
petroleum, gas, electrochemical, high pres-
sure, paper, paint and varnish, plastics
and measurements laboratories in addi-
tion to catalytic pilot plants—all calcu-
lated to educate top engineers for mod-
ern chemical industry.
From one class the Civil Engineering
Department has grown and subdivided
into seven distinct branches—construc-
tion, highway, highway traffic, hydraulic,
railroad, sanitary, and structural engineer-
ing—all branches having excellent class-
room and lab facilities. Camp Davis in
Wyoming provides the best opportunities
for experience in surveying for civil engi-
neering students of Michigan.
Continuing with the list of various de-
partments, the facilities can be extolled—
the electronic and photometric labs of the
Electrical Engineering Department, the
famed 360-foot naval tank of the Naval
Architecture and Marine Engineering De-
partment, the foundry complete with
spectrographic analysis equipment of the
Metallurgical Engineering Department,
and the numerous other laboratories.
The faculty of the Engineering College
has grown in tempo with the increasing
size of the College. From the handful of
educators who composed the engineering
faculty one hundred years ago has de-
veloped a large and competent faculty of
over two hundred men. This faculty in-
cludes, besides men in every major field
of engineering, the men who compose the
Engineering English Department which is
especially geared to meet the student
government and private industry in de-
velopment and improvement of products.
In all fields of engineering the Institute
utilizes the knowledge of the advanced
engineering student and thus supplies
him the vital practical experience.
But the Engineering College is not only
the modern facilities and the excellent
faculty. It is also the student engineer,
both singly and in groups. The student
engineer has changed in some ways—he
has many more fellow students, some of
whom are women and some from other
countries, but he is still the hard-work-
ing fellow with a slide rule and a Ian-

engineer's needs. In addition to the engi-
neering faculty, the student engineer has
his choice of literary college and business
administration courses and professors as
part of his elective program. Economics,
psychology, history and hundreds of other
subjects are offered to round out his
education.
Practical experience for student engi-
neers has received emphasis through the
services offered by the Engineering Re-
search Institute. Since its conception in
1919, the Engineering Research Institute
has made great strides in assisting both
guage all his own. Unlike the engineering
student of 1853, he has his own organi-
zations and activities in his corner of
campus. He belongs to a student pro-
fessional organization—the AIEE, the
AIChE, the AIME, the ASME, the IAS,
or Quarterdeck. He participates in extra-
curricular activities such as The Michi-
gan Tecbnic or the Stump Speakers So-
ciety of Sigma Rho Tau. If his grades are
high he may be selected for membership
in an honor society—Tau Beta Pi, Phi
Kappa Phi, Phi Eta Sigma, Triangles,

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


The articles preceding this one have
traced 100 years of progress in engineer-
ing and in the education of engineers.
By recalling the pioneering days of Pro-
fessor Winchell and the accomplishments
of today, we begin to see the unbelievable
progress that has been made since the
founding of the Engineering College.
Today we stand on the brink of a future
that promises to make yesterday seem
Paleolithic.
Well, what does the future hold for
engineering and the Engineering College
in particular?
History has seen curricula change and
whole new fields open due to the advances
of the basic sciences. Since engineering is
the most applied of the applied sciences,
then a look at the activities of basic sci-
ences should give a pretty good indication
of what direction the immediate future of
engineering will take.
Rather amazing advances are being
made in nearly every branch of the basic
sciences. The harnessing of nuclear energy
by physicists; discoveries of silicones by
chemists; all of this progress will soon be
affecting, and, indeed is already affecting,
our work as engineers.
Let's pause a moment here to run over
some of these advances and to see how
they will be affecting our profession and
the College of Engineering.
A brief glance over the work of the
basic sciences immediately brings to at-
tention the amazing and highly publi-
cized progress made toward harnessing
nuclear energy. Physicists have harnessed
the atom in theory; now it's the job of
engineering to build an atomic engine
and harness it in actuality. This, of course,
has its effect on the Engineering College.
Since these developments will touch all
fields, the College has created seven
courses in various phases of nuclear engi-
neering. These are now being offered by
the Aero, Chem-Met, and Electrical Engi-
neering Departments, and are in addition
to courses available to the engineering
student through the Lit School's Depart-
ment of Physics. As the practical applica-
tions found for nuclear energy increase,
so must the courses increase in number
and variety. Without doubt, the applica-
tions of atomic energy will soon become
so numerous that a Department of Nu-
clear Engineering will be created, and a
whole new field of engineering recog-
nized.
A little more quietly spectacular has
been the recent work done in the fields
of Chemistry and Bio-Chemistry. As the
discovery of the Haber process led to
synthetic nitrogenous fertilizers and dis-
coveries in polymerization led to synthetic
fabrics, so may current achievements in
basic chemistry be reflected in coming
years by the founding of new industries,
thus broadening the scope of Chemical
Engineering and affecting other fields as
well. Recent discoveries of new disease-
fighting anti-biotics and experiments in
the hydrogenation of coal open new
horizons to the Chem Engineer and may
soon demand new specialists, for example,
a Bio-Chemical Engineer.
In a similar manner has the field of
electronics been revolutionized by the re-
cent development of transitors. As minia-
turizing of equipment becomes a reality,
the Electronics Engineer finds all sorts of
new possibilities opening to him.
And then, consider Metallurgy. The
Metallurgical Engineer is currently all
excited over the new demands for hither-
to rare metals, such as Titanium, Ger-
manium, Beryllium, and of course, Uran-
ium. We can skip from one field to an-
other and we find about the same situa-
tion occurring everywhere. Nothing is
static; everyone of these fields is under-
going development. This presents a huge
challenge to the University and to the
Engineering College in particular.
Alumni can point with justified pride
to the pioneering research and develop-
ment work going on in the Engineering
College and in the Engineering Research
Institute. But unless these new develop-
ments are reflected in a broadened, up-to-
date curriculum for engineering students,
the young engineers graduated are going
to fall short of the requirements of in-
dustry and the University will have failed
to perform adequately its primary func-
tion. Fortunately, I believe that everyone
concerned realizes this. The addition of
new courses and the revision of old ones
certainly indicates that our education is
anything but out-dated. However, the
inevitable outcome of our rapidly accumu-
lating knowledge will probably be a five-
year program for engineers as the amount
to be learned becomes too great for a
four-year curriculum.
And the physical plant of the College
seems to be growing as though the plan-
ners had these thoughts in mind. Our
new North Campus plans include not
only buildings to satisfy certain present
inadequacies, but also include such addi-
tional classrooms, instructional labs, and
research facilities as will undoubtedly
prove necessary as the College and the
curriculum continue to expand.
Let's conclude this brief survey, then,
on a high note of optimism but with a

The Centennial of Engineering will
find the campus of the University studded
with very brilliant and renowned engi-
neers. They will be from all parts of our
country and abroad. Among these dis-
tinguished guests we will be honored with
the presence of six eminent speakers
drawn from government, industry, and
education. They are all very important
men in their fields.
The convocation will open with an ad-
dress by the Honorable Charles E. Wil-
son, Secretary of Defense. He will be
followed by Dr. Harvey M. Merker, Di-
rector of Scientific Relations, Park, Davis
and Company, whose subject will be
"Centennial History." Next will be our
own Dean of Engineering, George Gran-
ger Brown, who will talk on "The College
Today and Tomorrow." Mr. James W.
Parker, Consultant and Past President of
the Detroit Edison Company will then
speak on "Engineering the Future." Vice
President of the University of Michigan,
Wilbur K. Pierpont, will talk on "The
North Campus Development." The final
speech of the Convocation will be the
dedication of the Cooley Memorial Lab-
oratory by Mr. Walker L. Cisler, President
of the Detroit Edison Company.
Charles E. Wilson
CHARLES E. WILSON
The Honorable Charles E. Wilson,
Secretary of Defense, rose to fame
through his engineering career and as
President of General Motors Corporation.
His most recent acclaim was received
when he unselfishly severed his official
relationship with General Motors in order
to accept the position of Secretary of De-
fense offered by President Eisenhower.
Mr. Wilson was born in Ohio but
moved near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,
when he was fourteen years old. He grad-
uated from Carnegie Institute of Tech-
nology in 1909 in electrical engineering.
The next ten years saw him work up to
an important position in design and de-
velopment with the Westinghouse Electric
and Manufacturing Company.
In 1919 Mr. Wilson joined General
Motors as chief engineer and sales man-
ager of the automobile division of the
Remy Electric Company, which later be-
came the Delco-Remy Corporation. After
numerous promotions at Delco-Remy, he
was made a vice-president of General Mo-
tors in 1928. He was elected President of
the giant corporation in 1941.
Mr. Wilson was a member of the Board
of Directors of General Motors, chairman
of the Operations Policy Committee, a
member of the Financial Policy Commit-
tee, and chairman of the Administration
Committee. He is a member of the Epis-
copal Church and the Society of Automo-
tive Engineers as well as various social
clubs.
Today Mr. Wilson in his government
post is engaged in directing and coordin-
ating the efforts of industry to make our
country strong, both against outside
tyrants and from internal economic chaos.
DR. HARVEY M. MERKER
Dr. Harvey M. Merker is a man noted
for his ability and endless energy. He rose
from a laborer to Director of Scientific
Relations at Parke, Davis and Company.
Dr. Merker grew up in a poor section
of Detroit in a family of ten children. He
worked his way through the College of
Harvey M. Merker
Engineering of the University of Michi-
gan, graduating with a Bachelor of Sci-
ence degree in chemical engineering in
1909. He later received an honorary Mas-
ter of Engineering degree from the Uni-
versity of Michigan and an honorary
Doctor of Science degree in chemistry
from Wayne University.
Upon leaving Michigan in 1909 he
joined Parke, Davis and Company with
whom he has remained. His climb to fame
with Parke, Davis included various jobs
from barrel handler to Superintendent of
the Manufacturing Division.
Dr. Merkers' list of outside activities is
amazing. He holds 23 offices in civic, edu-
cational, church, and philanthropic or-
ganizations and is president, chairman, or
governor of six of them. He is an active
member of all 23 groups. One of his
many offices is chairman of the National
Advisory Committee to the University of
Michigan Phoenix Project. He has par-
ticular interest in the Franklin Settlement
of Detroit which aided him when he was
a boy. He established the first playground
of Detroit and is trustee of the settle-
ment.
Dr. Merker's busy life would not be
possible if he did not live up to his
formula for success, "If you start putting

things off, you are lost. I never waste
time. I never delay making a decision."
DEAN GEORGE GRANGER BROWN
Dean George Granger Brown heads the
College of Engineering of the University
of Michigan. His rise to the position of
director of this one hundred year old in-
stitution was a result of his outstanding
record as a chemical engineer who spent
thirty-three years on the faculty.
Dean Brown was born and raised in
New York City. New York University
presented him with his B.S. in Chemistry
in 1917. During World War I he was
with the growing Aluminum Company of
America.
In 1920 Dr. Brown started his long
career in education by becoming a mem-
ber of the University of Michigan engi-
neering faculty. He continued his own
education here, receiving a Master of
Science in Engineering, in 1922, and a
Ph.D in 1924. He received a full Profes-
sorship in 1930. In 1951 he was appoint-
ed to his present position.
Dean Brown's activity as a faculty
member was not restricted to the Univer-
sity's campus. As a consultant to various
industries, he spent many of his summers
in all parts of the United States working
on their problems. In December of 1949,
he was named director of the Engineering
Division for the U. S. Atomic Energy
Commission.
Dean Brown is a member of Phi Beta
Kappa, Sigma Xi, Tau Beta Pi, Phi Kappa
Phi, Iota Alpha and Phi Lambda Upsilon.
He also belongs to numerous professional
societies.
JAMES W. PARKER
Mr. James W. Parker joined the Detroit
Edison Company in 1910 when he had
been out of college for a year and a half.
He remained active with the company for
over forty years and retired as President
in 1951.
Mr. Parker graduated in engineering
from Cornell University in 1908. Shortly
after joining Detroit Edison he was placed
with a boiler design group. As an appren-
tice under the direction of the operating
crew he gained much experience that was
to aid him in his long climb to the top.
He was made Chief Assistant Engineer of
Power Plants in 1915 and assumed re-
sponsibility for the engineering of new
power plant installations. In 1917 he was
given the additional title of Vice Presi-
dent.
With his appointment to Chief Engi-
neer in 1924, Mr. Parker directed his
company's expansion during the boom-
ing 1920's. His concern for the welfare
i m
James W. Parker
of his employees was shown when he kept
them off the public relief rolls by con-
tinuing this expansion to completion dur-
ing the following depression period. His
engineering responsibilities ended in 1943
when he was made General Manager.
He was appointed Chairman of the In-
dustrial Advisory Group of the Atomic
Energy Commission in 1947. He went to
Germany in 1949 to help reorganize the
German utility system. Since his retire-
ment in 1951, Mr. Parker has acted as
Consultant to Detroit Edison Company.
DR. WILBUR KENT PIERPONT
Dr. Wilbur K. Pierpont, a non-engi-
neer, is Vice President of the University
in charge of business and finance. He
climbed from a candidate for a Masters
Wilbur K. Pierpont
degree in Business Administration to this
important position in only fifteen years.
A native "Michigander," Dr. Pierpont
spent his first twelve years on a farm at
Winn, Michigan. Then his family moved
to Mt. Pleasant where he graduated from
high school. In 1934 he graduated from
Central State Teachers College with an
A.B. degree.
After two years of teaching high school
mathematics and coaching basketball at
Belding, Michigan, Mr. Pierpont decided
to come to the University of Michigan for
graduate work. By 1942 he had earned a
Master's degree in Business Administra-
tion and a Doctor's degree in Philosophy.
World War II found him with the
Army, Navy, and O.P.A. He worked as
price analyst in jobs for the O.P.A. and

TECHNOLOGY
BY
CHARLES W. PHILLIPS
Instructor in Chemical and Metallurgical Engineering
Man's success in his constant striving
for a better existence is measurable by his
mastery of materials. The sequence of
progress is indicated by the terms applied
to various stages of human development:
the stone age, the bronze age, the iron
age, the age of power, and more recently,
the atomic age—each telling of victory in
a struggle to win more desirable but less
easily obtained substances from nature.
The history of these advances is not a
simple one. Continual but slow progress
through practical observation, the sudden
impetus of basic discovery, the effect of
of Bessemer made available the large
quantities of steel necessary for the found-
ation of our modern transportation system
and led to the much expanded activities
of the civil engineer.
The growing science of electricity im-
proved still more the web of communica-
tion, and, coupled with chemistry and
the mechanical technology of the time,
culminated in the concurrent but indepen-
dent discovery of the electrolysis of me-
tallic aluminum from fused salts by Her-
roult and Hall.
This was of the greatest significance,

abstract theory, and the occasional flash
of genius all are contributory factors.
Knowledge of a few metals suitable for
engineering applications existed for a very
long period. The acceleration of tech-
nology began with the application of
steam power, and the parallel improve-
ment in machinery to utilize this power.
The basis of modern chemistry grew
apace during this period, and from this
and better machinery and power an infant
chemical industry was born. The discovery
for it marked the first commercial winning
of a metal from its ore without the neces-
sity of carbon as a chemical reducing
agent.
The growth of non-metallic materials
such as vulcanized rubber, celluloid, bake-
lite and other plastics may be mentioned
as paralleling the previously cited de-
velopments.
Restricting our further consideration
to the metals, for they are by far the most
commonly used materials in machines,
we note that at the turn of the century,
iron, copper, and the infant aluminum
were the basis for the overwhelming bulk
of alloys used; lead and tin held a second-
ary but important role as bearing metals.
The triumph of flight with its persistent
requirement for ever lighter and stronger
alloys, and the necessity for greater power
has led to the emergence of magnesium
alloys on the one hand, and heat-resistant
nickel and cobalt base alloys on the other.
It is directly responsible also for the great
interest today in the newest of the engi-
neering metals, titanium.
As in the case of many other elements,
titanium, the ninth most abundant ele-
ment in the earth's crust, has long been
known. First mention of it was made by
Gregor in Cornwall, 1791, who observed
the presence of a new metallic oxide from
the mineral now known as ilmenite,
FeTi03. The chemist, Klaproth, gave the
metal the temporary name titanium, after
the Titans, mythical sons of the Earth—a
name which became permanent.
Metallic titanium was first obtained by-
reduction of calcium titanium fluoride,
Ca2TiF6, with metallic potassium by Ber-
zelius in 1825. The first samples of suffi-
cient purity to reveal accurately the prop-
erties of the element were prepared by
Hunter in 1910; Hunter reduced titanium
tetrachloride with metallic sodium in a
steel bomb.
The present commercially feasible
method of reducing the metal was de-
veloped in 1940 by Kroll, of the U. S.
Bureau of Mines, using the combination
titanium tetrachloride-liquid magnesium
in an argon atmosphere.
The Bureau of Mines conducted suffi-
cient experimental work on the metal to
outline significant properties and suitable
procedures of reducing, consolidating,
melting, and alloying, which were pre-
sented in the historical U. S. Bureau of
Mines Information Circular No. 7381 in
1946. This date marks the inception of
titanium as an engineering alloy. Since
then the metal has gone into commercial

myriad special properties and applications.
Some of these fundamental physical and
mechanical properties as compared with
those of other alloys are presented in
Table II. In addition to the items noted,
the excellent corrosion resistance of titan-
ium in nearly all media except those con-
taining fluorides, hydrofluoric, hydro-
chloric, and high concentrations of sul-
furic acids must be mentioned.
The reasons for the interest in titanium
are obvious. Its corrosion resistance, light
weight, high strength, and high strength-
weight ratio make it of consuming im-
portance to the aircraft designer, in par-
ticular, and generally to other design engi-
neers seeking materials with special com-
binations of desirable properties.
This very brief outline of the subject,
however, tells only half the story. It takes
little perspicacity to detect the reason for
the delayed development of so plentiful
and working a material. Extensive eco-
nomic deposits of ilmenitc and rutile,
TiO.,, are known and being exploited.
The major areas of difficulty are the ex-
traction and fabrication of the metal and

ed and annealed, a (Hep) and P (Bcc)

its alloys. Each of these will be discussed
briefly, with reference to the talents neces-
sary for solving the problems.
The Kroll process, although the only
suitable commercial production method,
suffers from several serious drawbacks:
(1) the high investment cost for the
special equipment necessary, such as
vacuum pumps, stainless steel reactors,
complex temperature, pressure and meter-
ing controls; (2) the high operating cost
entailed by the use of argon or helium,
the time necessary to remove the MgCI,
reaction product by sublimation, and the
removal of the porous titanium sponge
from the reaction chamber.
Costs will undoubtedly be reduced
somewhat from the present $5.00 per
pound by this method through improved
engineering, but hope for dramatic price
decrease lies in either direct reduction of
Ti02 without the intermediate step of
conversion to TiClJ; or the electrolytic re-
duction of some compound in a fused salt
mixture to massive titanium. The known
thermodynamics of titanium compounds
indicate that calcium is the only metal
capable of reducing TiO;, to a metal purity
of less than O.l'/r oxygen, which is essen-
tial, if suitable ductility is to be obtained.
Experiments to date on the latter method
have yielded metal of suitable purity, but
in a loose, large surfaced, dendritic form
undesirable, again, because of the reactiv-
ity with oxygen. This problem, clearly, is

THE BEST YEARS of his life are not all past for Tom
Toman (left) of Casper, Wyoming. Tom retired over
five years ago after 26 years with Standard Oil. He's
here shown fishing on the North Platte River, with
his son, Rudy, now one of our employees at Casper.
Every month Tom receives retirement income pro-
vided through his and the company's contributions to
Standard Oil's retirement plan while he was working.
TESTED WAYS TO BETTER LIVING
Better living can begin with your job. The fact
that 19,900 employees of Standard Oil and its
subsidiary companies have been with us for more than
10 years is evidence of that.
What do all these people find in their jobs that
keeps them happy?
Steady work at good pay comes first to mind. But in
addition to being assured of better-than-average earn-
ings with a growing and progressive company, Standard
Oilers can work with the company toward security for
themselves and their families. Employee benefits have
been steadily improved since the company's first retire-
ment checks were mailed to Standard Oilers in 1903.
Our present retirement plan, in which more than 90%
of our eligible employees participate, is part of one of
the broadest employee benefit programs in any industry.
These benefits help guard against financial stress in
case of accident—on or off the job—or sickness, and
bring such things as hospitalization, regular savings,

TRIBUTIONS OF HERBERT HOOVER
BY
DOUGLAS NAUTS, '56E
The Mortimer E. Cooley Essay Contest
is sponsored annually by the Engineering
College in memory of Dean Cooley, and
its $200 prize is offered to induce thought
in engineering students on topics of a lib-
eral, nontechnical sort. The topics for the
1952-53 contest were: Appraisals of the
Social Contributions of Westinghouse,
Hoover, Edison, or Morse. The winning
essay is below; it was written by Douglas
Nauts, a sophomore, and concerns the con-
tributions of Herbert Hoover.
Herbert Hoover, 39th president of the
United States of America, has finally been
accepted as a great American. Only time-
could erase the stain of vilification and
lies which he has suffered. In the history
of our country few men have been so
misrepresented, so misunderstood as
Hoover. If greatness is judged by how a
man faces tremendous setbacks, and pon-
derous disappointments, then Hoover can
be called one of the world's greatest men.
The Hoover greatness is not a blatant
greatness; it is neither a greatness of
tyranny nor wealth. It is a greatness of
humility, altruism and patriotism.
In the early 1930's when the voices of
millions upon millions of men accused
Hoover of being a traitor, of deserting his
country, of greed, of practically every
iniquity plaguing man, he seemed to be a
monstrous personification of evil. Yet he
did not cry out against his tormentors, nor
did he offer excuses for his failures.
With a quiet strength and dignity, he
turned his other cheek to them. But the
people, seeking a scapegoat for their mis-
fortunes, reviled him and finally threw
him from the highest office in the land.
Time, the great restorer, has since then
vindicated Herbert Hoover, his life and
actions. The accusation that Mr. Hoover
brought upon us the greatest depression
in the history of this country has been
proven groundless. It has been shown that
Hoover, rather than hastening and aid-
ing the depression in its early days, was
often the only obstacle in its path.
The highest compliment that can be
given a man can be used to describe
Hoover—that he was a Christian. Of
Quaker parentage and upbringing, Her-
bert Hoover developed a philosophy of
"helping his fellow man" which has mo-
tivated his entire life. Like most real
Christians, Herbert Hoover did not adver-
tise his good deeds and charities. But his
actions speak for themselves. Quakers be-
lieve that more than just face adherence
to "helping your man" was necessary and
that this was the prime worldly virtue.
They thought that wealth was merely a
means of achieving this end. And so it
was with Herbert Hoover; the greatest
part of his life has been spent in succor
and service to man, regardless of belief,
philosophy or nationality.
Herbert Hoover is an engineer. He re-
ceived his degree in mining engineering
from Stanford University in 1896. Dur-
ing his entire life he has been character-
ized by the engineering way of thinking,
as a politician, humanitarian and busi-
nessman. What is the engineering way of
thinking? It might be described in terms
of the engineering approach to a prob-
lem. The problem is first recognized and
facts pertinent to the problem are as-
similated. Hoover would often remain
silent on a question rather than advance
a solution based upon other than facts-.
Tentative solutions drawn from facts are
advanced, evaluated and discarded until
a solution satisfying the conditions of
the problem is found; then the solution is
applied. An engineer might be called a
practical scientist with a strong respect for
the all-mighty dollar. Hoover's success in
fields other than engineering is often at-
tributed to the application of this same
engineering approach to all problems.
All of Hoover's policies and actions have
been the result of careful consideration
and thought. Hoover was never a dream-
er, but always a hard headed realist whose
maturity was strongly flavored by the
practicalities of the business world.
The social contributions of Herbert
Hoover can be divided into three main
categories: as an engineer-businessman,
as a politician and social worker, and
those of his later life.
The Social Contributions of Herbert
Hoover, Engineer-Businessman
Hoover in the early part of the 20th
century was estimated by his co-workers
and fellow engineers as one of the most
able and proficient men in his field. Her-
bert Hoover was one of the foremost
authorities on mining engineering in the
country. He developed several money sav-
ing processes for refining low content
ores and wrote a textbook on mining
engineering which for many years was
used as a standard textbook in most engi-
neering colleges. The range of his engi-
neering and business activities make it
difficult to realize that they were the work
of one man during the course of less than
twenty years.
Hoover was often accused of being a
laissez faire capitalist; of being money
hungry. This might be partly true of the
early years of his life but before we con-
demn this man for being an exploiting
money monger let us examine his mo-
tives. As was stated earlier, adherents of
the Quaker religion wish to devote their
lives, if possible, to a whole-hearted suc-
cor of their fellow man. Hoover was born
into a relatively poor Quaker family. He
saw that if he was to dedicate his life to
this cause, he would have to keep the
wolf outside the door first. This early
quest of capitalistic gain was to attain
financial independence for himself and
his family. Bcause of this, in later life he
could devote himself completely to public
service without reservation, or energy
draining financial worries. It was this
thought of his family plus the fact that
he felt that kindness must have no finan-
cial strings attached, must be spontan-
eously openhearted, that made him realize
that the poor man cannot afford to be
generous without injury to himself, his
friends and his family. During the first
twenty years of his life, Hoover received
the only emolument of his entire life.
Needless to say the price of financial inde-
pendence is high. There is no doubt that
if Herbert Hoover would have continued

lectrical wires and cables
Natural rubber, including Laytex®,
GR-S synthetic rubber and thermoplastic
insulations are available in two classes, de-
pending on whether they are designed for
use in dry or wet locations. Standard insula-
tions, Type R and Laytex Type RU (made
from rubber) and Type T (made from
thermoplastic ) are for use in dry locations
while moisture-resistant insulations Types
RW, RUW, and TW are for use in wet
locations. There are many installations, par-
ticularly in buildings, where the less costly
standard compounds give entirely satis-
factory service.
Natural rubber and GR-S synthetic
rubber insulations are also available in
two classes depending on the operating
temperature for which they are de-
signed, namely, Type R and RW for
60 G operation and Type RH and RUH
for 75 C operation. Conductors insu-
lated with RH insulation carry more
current, that is, use the conductor more
efficiently than those insulated with
Type R insulation. There is also avail-
able a combination insulation capable
of operating at 60 C in wet locations
and 75 C in dry locations. Butyl rubber
insulation is suitable for operation at
80 C and silicone rubber for even
higher temperatures.
The thermoplastic insulations described
above are limited to 600 volts for general
power distribution. The rubber and rubber-
like insulations are limited to a maximum
operating voltage of 5000. For operation at
higher voltages where ozone is produced in

quantity, resistance to ozone in the insula-
tion must be provided.
Acceptable ozone resistance in rubber
and GR-S synthetic rubber insulations
is provided by incorporating in them
relatively high percentages of an inert
or chemically saturated compound such
as vulcanized vegetable oil. These are
the so-called oil base compounds. Com-
pounds made from butyl rubber are
inherently ozone resistant. Oil base and
butyl compounds are suitable for opera-
tion at a maximum voltage of about
28 KV, grounded neutral, when prop-
erly shielded.
Varnished cambric insulated cables are
generally used in the same voltage range
as ozone resistant rubber, that is, at a
maximum of 28 KV, grounded neutral, and
at a maximum conductor temperature of
85 C For use in wet locations varnished
cambric cables must be covered with a
lead sheath.
Impregnated paper-insulated, lead-
covered cables are suitable for operation
at voltages up to 69 KV at a maximum
temperature of 85 C. Gas or oil filled
paper insulated cables are suitable for
higher voltage services at somewhat
reduced temperatures.
Insulation thicknesses for all insulations
depend on the rated voltage, the conductor
size and type of insulation. Minimum in-
sulation resistance and test voltages have
been established for all classifications.

in the pursuit of business he would have
become a multi-millionaire. The large sal-
aries he obtained attested to the value of
the work he performed.
Shortly after graduating from Stanford
University in 1895, Hoover journeyed to
San Francisco where he became employed
in a job of minor capacities under Louis
Janin, one of the great mining engineers
of the world. Hoover's abilities and his
trustworthiness were soon recognized and
he made rapid advancement. At the age
of twenty-three Mr. Hoover was placed in
charge of one of the largest gold mining
operations in the world in Australia. This
was a tremendous job for one of this age,
entailing great responsibility. In two years
through the use of new techniques and
mining processes and skillful organiza-
tion, he transformed this Australian bank-
rupt failure into a thriving business en-
terprise. Soon after this success, Mr. Hoo-
ver was employed by the Chinese govern-
ment to prospect for and develop existing
metalic deposits.
In China he traveled to the far reaches
of the provinces of Chihli, Manchuria,
Mongolia, Shantung and Shansi. His ex-
ploratory trips discovered some of the
worlds largest and best coal deposits in
northeastern China. At about this time the
growing unrest of China broke into revo-
lutionary outbursts and later flamed into
the Boxer Rebellion. This unrest first
slowed down and later ended his work in
China, but not before he had accomplish-
ed considerable good as a mining engi-
neer, notably, the development of the
Kaiping mines.
His accomplishments in China and
earlier in Australia, brought him a part-
nership offer in 1902 from the same Lon-
don mining firm with which he had be-
gun his Australian career. During the
next dozen years, working with this same
prominent engineering firm, his travels
covered the world. He made low-grade
mineral deposits, unprofitable under obso-
lete methods, yield great profits. It was
Hoover who developed the flotation proc-
ess for refining zinc and lead. As an
executive he strove to eliminate waste.
Wherever he worked he blazed a trail for
American engineers, American methods
and created a demand for American ma-
chinery and products.
In the period from 1897 to 1914 he
visited Australia, England, Canada, Japan,
Korea, China, India, Burma, South Africa,
(Continued from page 28)
Russia, Belgium, France, Holland, the
Malay States, New Zealand and many
other countries. During this time Hoover
performed a valuable service to his coun-
try by serving as an unappointed ambassa-
dor, spreading American ideas and good
will. The ^scope of his engineering and
business activities make- it hard to realize
that they were the work of one man.
Hoover provided new sources of revenue
and increased the respective wealth of
each of these nations and thereby strength-
ened their respective economies. So you
can see that the seventeen odd years of
Hoover's engineering career were by no
means bereft of contributions to his fel-
low man. It is estimated that Herbert
Hoover has added not less than a billion
dollars to the actual tangible weighable
wealth of the world.
The Social Contributions of Herbert
Hoover, Social Worker and Politician
In 1914 Hoover, as a resident of Cali-
fornia, was induced to take on the task
of enlisting the participation of European
governments and industries in the San
Francisco Panama-Pacific Exposition. It
was while he was traveling from Euro-
pean capital to capital that the rumblings
of trouble in Europe began to make them-
selves heard. Shortly after the Austrian
Archduke and Duchess were murdered,
war broke out. At this time there was a
considerable number of American tour-
ists in Europe and at the outbreak of war
they all flocked to London. In London a
myriad of troubles faced them. Payments
on traveler checks were curtailed, food
supplies were inadequate, and transporta-
tion back to the States was non-ex istant
because nearly all transportation had been
diverted to the pursuit of war. The
American ambassador, knowing Hoover's
ability as an organizer, in desperation ap-
pealed to him for aid. The situation was
utterly disorganized and the tourists be-
gan to grow panicky. Hoover gathered a
number of engineers and businessmen
around him and in a rapidly efficient man-
ner created order from the chaos. They
found food, shelter, cashed checks and
finally provided transportation. This
marked the beginning of a great career in
public life.
Due to Hoover's far reaching mining
interests and operations he was in a posi-
tion to control a large share of the world's
supply of base metals. In other words,
during the war, if he would have con-
tinued in private industry, he could have
become fabulously wealthy. But he sold
his mining interests and from this time
forth devoted himself whole-heartedly to
helping others.
Germany, in the beginning of the war,
quickly overran Belgium. The Belgium
people before this had imported up to
80% of their foodstuffs. The Germans in
retaliation for the British action of bot-
tling up their fleet, placed a food block-
ade upon all conquered territory. This
threatened to starve millions. As the sit-
uation became desperate Hoover was
placed in command of what was later to
become known as the Commission for Re-
lief in Belgium. This organization, begun
by a group of humanitarians, not by gov-
ernment decree, in order to secure their
named purpose (aiding Belgiums), had
to surmount tremendous obstacles. Their
plan of providing relief met with not only
the objections of the Germans but also the
French and English. In addition, they had
no real funds. These problems, after much
work, work, and more work were some-
how circumvented by Hoover and Com-
pany. This colossal enterprise proved to
be the greatest humanitarian or relief en-
terprise in the history of the world. The
Commission for Relief in Belgium ship-
ped, purchased and arranged for the dis-
tribution of 33,841,307 metric tons of
food, clothing and medical supplies
valued at $5,234,028,209- Hoover
through the enormity of his efforts and
leadership won the undying thanks and
admiration of the Belgium people.
This was only a beginning. After three
years of unceasing labor on Belgium re-
lief, President Wilson appointed Herbert
Hoover U.S. Food Administrator, whose
job it was to create and direct our food
policies. The Hoover policies concerning
food were all built around one idea, that
of securing the people's voluntary co-
operation on all questions concerning
food and crop regulation. Mr. Hoover
looked with horror upon any program
which commandeered crops from a free
people, policed consumers or distributed
food cards. In the entire course of the
First World War, no ration cards were
issued and there were no food enforce-
ment officers to irritate the people.
In the face of immense food demands

See that tiny speck of oxide on a hair-like
wire? It's called a thermistor, and
it's the first practical thermally sensi-
tive resistor. It's so sensitive it will
measure temperature variations
within one-millionth of a degree. As
a circuit element and control device,
this small, stable and rugged unit
has a place in a variety of electrical
circuits.
Although the thermistor is the smallest
and, in appearance, one of the simp-
lest devices made by Western Elec-
tric—manufacturing unit of the Bell
Telephone System—it was more
than 100 years in the making.
Back in the 19th Century—some time
before Western Electric was founded
in 1869—Michael Faraday studied a
curious thermally sensitive resistor
material similar to that used in 20th
Century thermistors. As Faraday
and others after him discovered, the
trouble with making effective use of
this material was that different units
made by what seemed to be the
same process, showed large variations
in their behavior. The problem of
how to control the amount of im-
purities present in the material was
finally solved a few years ago by our
research team mates at Bell Tele-
phone Laboratories.
At Western Electric's Allentown (Pa.)
Plant hundreds of minute thermistor
components are electrically tested and
sorted every day. The basic component,
an oxide, has a large negative temper-
ature coefficient of resistivity.
Once beyond the laboratory stage,
Western Electric's engineers tackled
the job of mass-producing the hard-
to-handle oxides. After many trials
they got a pilot line in operation —
then a full scale production line
through which compressed powders
of thermistor material could be sin-
tered into a strong, compact and
homogenous mass. Today reliable
thermistors are being made in many
shapes and sizes—small beads, rods,
discs, washers — to meet varying
circuit and design problems. To
make this possible, Western Electric
engineers had to find new ways to
apply a slurry of oxides on wire; new
ways to extrude and mold oxide
mixtures.
At every turn, the thermistor has pre-
sented fresh challenges to our engi-
neers. Engineering is like that at
Western Electric—where technical
men of varied skills pool their knowl-
edge in a constant search for new
and better ways to do things.
The thermistor takes many forms de-
pending on the resistance and power-
handling capacity needed in a particu-
lar circuit.

Food Administration succeeded in han-
dling available food in such an efficient
manner that no real shortages occurred in
our country. The United States in World
War I fed practically all of the allied civil-
ians and military forces. Hoover's prob-
lem was an intricate one. Shortages
of various foods were continuously pla-
guing him. Through publicity campaigns
and slogans, Hoover induced the people
to endure wheatless Mondays and Wed-
nesdays, meatless Tuesdays, porkless
Thursdays and Saturdays. "Serve just
enough" became the patriotic by-word of
the American people. The slogan "food
will win the war" became the central
theme of all Food Administration adver-
tising. And indeed, it would have been
doubtful that we could have defeated the
Axis powers in the short time that we did
if this aid had not been given our allies.
A starving weakened country is not much
of a fighter.
In two years the Food Administration
1 under the leadership of H. Hoover, ac-
complished a stupendous job. It tripled
food shipments to Europe in two years
at a minimum of cost. A comparison be-
tween the food programs of World War
I and World War II can be easily drawn.
In World War I all food regulation was
voluntary; in the second war food regula-
tion was accomplished through law. This
resulted in a maximum of red tape in
the Second World War. The World War
I food program was estimated at
$52,000,000; the cost of the World War
II food program is estimated to have run
well into the billions. The difference?
Hoover. Much criticism has been leveled
at the Democratic administration for not
using the services of Mr. Hoover in the
Second World War because of his previ-
ous experience in food administration.
After his long and difficult labors in
Belgium relief and food administration
during the war, H. Hoover did not choose
to rest upon his laurels. He took into hand
the reins of the postwar American Relief
Organization and again proceeded to per-
form a great service to mankind through
aid to the impoverished. In spite of being
always plagued by lack of funds, delay,
indifference, greed, petty hates, and preju-
dices, he again succeeded. Axis as well as
Allied countries were helped.* The pangs

ravages of war had shattered and killed, creat-
ing homeless and starving.

of hunger even in Communist Russia were
alleviated by A.R.A. funds. Hoover be-
lieved that peace is impossible when
people have their minds twisted and de-
formed by starvation. The story of the
American Relief Administration, like
most humanitarian enterprises Mr. Hoo-
ver anticipated in, is long and detailed
because of its immensity. Again Hoover
met the problems confronting him with
the familiar Hoover efficiency and vigor
and again he won the eternal gratitude of
the people of many nations who might
have starved without A.R.A. aid.
In 1921, his relief work complete, Mr.
Hoover became Secretary of Commerce.
Herbert Hoover was no longer a little
known engineer but a person of inter-
national reputation. In modesty, Hoover
tried to escape the bright glare of the
public eye but from this time on until
he was defeated as president, it remained
mercilessly upon him.
"As Secretary of Commerce, Hoover
carried through invaluable reforms and
initiated a great number of plans bene-
fitting the American public. He created an
entire division in the Department of Com-
merce whose duty it was to create a code
of ethics for business and trade associa-
tions. He created a Division of Commer-
cial Standards which standardized sizes
and measurements and eliminated waste-
ful odd sizes of such products as bricks,
beds, machinery, etc. Hoover stabilized"
building costs and thereby helped the
American home owner. Mr. Hoover re-
organized the Department of Commerce
from the ground up and revitalized such
divisions as the Bureau of Mines and the
Bureau of Patents. He was a leading fig-
use in plans cutting the cost of govern-
ment and increasing its efficiency.
Herbert Hoover was Secretary of Com-
merce for eight years. The public, because
of his humanitarian efforts esteemed
Hoover as a very great American. He was
held in respect, almost veneration, by all.
In 1928 President Coolidge enigmatically
decided not to run again for the presi-
dency. Immediately some of Hoover's ad-
mirers proposed him for president. The
murmurings of "Hoover for president"
soon grew into a mighty shout and in
1929 Herbert Hoover was elected Presi-
dent of the United States of America.
The next four years of Herbert Hoo-
ver's life were to be the most crucial of
his life. And it is these four years that
are most often misrepresented and mis-
understood. Of all the periods of
Hoover's life this is the most difficult to
assess. In any evaluation of these four
years one must attempt to remain un-
biased and examine only the facts and not
the misconceptions. Without a doubt
Hoover in these years met some of the
most crushing problems he had ever faced.
In 1929 many forces had been at work
for a number of years undermining the
financial strength of America. Foreign
trade agencies were beginning to default.
Banks which had lent money to foreign
banks found they could not get their
money back. Hoover as Secretary of Com-
merce had warned the commercial and
financial leaders of this country, not once,
but a score of times, of the shadow
looming upon the horizon. The danger,
as he saw it, resulted from overproduc-
tion with a limited market. In 1925 the
danger became so apparent to him that he
spoke rather frankly of overproduction
and the folly of making foreign loans for
non-productive purposes and on doubtful
security. Hoover recognized that using
strong language might precipitate disaster.
Few listened to him. And so it was that
financial men pooh-poohed him and drag-
ged this country to near disaster.
World wide depression began its
treacherous march across the lands of the
earth in the fall of 1927. The stock mar-
ket crash in the fall of 1929 struck with
little warning, shocking and demoralizing
the American people. The American stock
market crash was the clinching blow for
complete world-wide depression and her-
alded the beginning of many years of
economic hardships.
President Hoover acted immediately.

AIR MUSCLE...
Properly compressed and coupled to this drilling
tool, air packs a rock-busting wallop. How differ-
ent from the days when men slung sledges, and
even cracking pavement was a slow, tortuous task
... as were many other manual jobs in industry.
MIND OVER MUSCLE...
When men of science learned how to put a cyclone
in a cylinder, pneumatic tools and compressed air
became salient servants in saving men's muscles
and industry's time.
In its more than two hundred applications com-
pressed air cleans, sprays, operates machines for
hoisting, hauling, hammering, drilling, cutting,
grinding, blowing, pumping. Applied in free or en-
closed action this versatile, conveniently-convey-
able power agent may be found at work in mines
and mills, on highways and skyways, on and under
the water, in production and processing.
AMERICA WORKS LIKE THAT...
Uniquely so. For here, every art, every science,
every branch of engineering work together for the
good of all. And the power behind their progress

drought threatened to annihilate the cattle
herds of the west. Crops were danger-
ously reduced. Hoover again organized
relief and took immediate action to mini-
mize losses.
From 1930 on, President Hoover had
an unfriendly, recalcitrant Democratic .'
congress to work with. Hardly a day pass-,
ed when Congress was in session that one
or more Democratic party leaders did not
make a speech violently denouncing
Hoover. In all of these Hoover was at-
tacked as being heartless, inept, blunder-
ing, or incapable. These accomplished
two things: they destroyed Hoover politi-
cally and they shattered the faith of the
people in their government.
Herbert Hoover labored day and night,
often as much as twenty hours a day, in
the cause of his country. Every last bit of
energy he possessed went into the ful-
fillment of one purpose, helping the
American people. In 1931 Hoover or-
ganized the Reconstruction Finance Cor-
poration which was to provide working
capital for financially starved business en-

trial output and employment were on the

) had not occurred. The power of the de-
structive world economic forces was spent.
Outside the United States complete re-
covery began to be felt in the summer of
1932. But the wranglings of an unco-
operative, unfriendly congress continued
to harass Hoover and block him from
carrying out a really vigorous anti-depres-
sion program. At the end of 1932 came
the national elections.
For four years Hoover had been the
target of various mud-slingers whose prin-
ciple weapons consisted of misrepresenta-
tion and sensationalism. The barrage of
slander in President Hoover's direction
during his administration has never been
equaled in viciousness and volume. The
so-called "Michelson mills" in Washing-
ton ground out page after page of

elements of our population paid millions
for this continuation of the Hoover de-
faming propaganda. The people were dis-
illusioned and demoralized because of the
depression and naturally sought someone
to blame the entire mess upon. In seeking
a scape-goat they chose Hoover whose
reticence in replying to the heaps of abuse
showered upon himself seemed to them
to be a silent admission of guilt. Hoover
had to carry out his entire anti-depression
program under the cross-fire of a hateful
congress and an unfriendly citizenry. The
people, tired of things as they were, were
naturally more receptive to the flowery
promises and programs of the Democrats.
Thus it was that Herbert Hoover was de-
feated in the elections of 1932.
The New York Times (June 16, 1934)
stated that "The change for the better in
the last half of 1932 is beyond dispute.
That this evident revival of confidence
was suddenly reversed in February 1933 is
equally true." This improved situation be-
gan to disintegrate shortly after President
Hoover's defeat in the November elec-
tions. After the elections President-elect
Roosevelt ordered Democratic leaders in
the Senate to confirm no Hoover nomi-
nations. He also ordered them, in fact, to
pass nothing Mr. Hoover recommended.
But meanwhile the country was being
plunged into post-election disaster. This
in effect tied Hoover's hands behind his
back so that he was helpless to meet the
threatening collapse. The country, in this
time of great danger and need was virtu-
ally without a government. Since this was
caused in the main by President-elect
Roosevelt's refusal to co-operate with
Hoover, the Detroit Free Press, The New
York Herald Tribune, the Baltimore Sun,
and many other prominent newspapers
severely criticized Roosevelt, and justly so.
The blame for the crippling effect of this
recession rests not upon Hoover, but
squarely upon the shoulders of Roosevelt.
In the entirety of Herbert Hoover's
career as a humanitarian and a politician .;
it can be said that he always gave his best.
Hoover felt that good work proceeded
from hard work and drove himself ac-
cordingly. His work in foreign aid was
invaluable. It is doubtful whether any
man could have carried through any of
Hoover's aid programs with even half
of Hoover's effectiveness. He was always
there where you needed him and when

Completes Test on Power Transformer
Allis-Chalmers in August announced
successful completion of impulse and 60-
cycle tests on a 600,000-volt, single-
phase power transformer. The 5,000-kva
unit is the latest step in a five year de-
velopment program aimed at more effi-
cient coordination of high-voltage insu-
lation.
In addition to the 700-kv, low fre-
quency tests, the transformer was given
A.I.E.E. impulse tests of 1600-kv full
wave and 1840-kv chopped wave. Ac-
cording to Allis-Chalmers engineers, the
unit is built to withstand 600-kv, three-
phase transmission line service with light-
ning arresters now available, or 880-kv
service when suitable protective equip-
ment becomes available.
The transformer was built primarily to
determine whether present basic data and
calculating methods will be adequate to
design power transformers at voltages far
beyond those now being planned. It will
now be used for experimental and test
work at Allis-Chalmers West Allis Works.
Since no standard terminal bushing
capable of withstanding this extreme volt-
age was available, it was necessary to de-
sign and build one. Overall length of the
bushing is 17 feet including the four-foot
diameter corona shield. According to
Allis-Chalmers engineers, variations of
this "big apple" atop high voltage trans-
formers may become a familiar sight in
the days ahead as ultra high transmission
voltages become more common.
Other new design features of the trans-
former include very low oil requirement
and final clamping of both core and coils
after assembly in the tank.
Experience gained in building and test-
ing this transformer is being put to use in
construction of the largest single-phase
transformers in the United States—six
345-kv, 200,000-kva auto transformers for
the Bonneville Power Administration.
Other important high-voltage equipment
under construction includes a total of one
and one-quarter million kva of 330-kv
transformers and auto transformers for
the Ohio Valley Electric Corporation and
the Atomic Energy Commission.

25-horsepower into its 10 pounds helps
our Navy submarine crews to guide their
deadly torpedoes on a true course. The
useful working life of the motor is but a
fraction of a second—then it is blasted
apart.
Development of the small but powerful
motor, little larger than a rolled-up news-
paper, was announced in East Springfield,
Mass., recently by the Westinghouse Elec-
tric Corporation. Volume production in
undisclosed numbers is under way for the
Navy at the local plant of the firm's
Electric Appliance Division.
While engineering details of the motor
are restricted for security reasons, it was
revealed that its sole "life work" is to
serve as a starter for the torpedo's gyro-
scope—the guiding mechanism which
keeps a torpedo on its predetermined
course. A small prong at one end of the
motor shaft meshes with the gyro's fly-
wheel as the torpedo is shot from its tube.

MR. WALKER L. CISLER
Mr. Walker L. Cisler rose from farm
boy to President of the Detroit Edison
Company. He was raised on a farm in
Pennsylvania. Working his way through
Cornell's engineering school was not easy,
but he managed to play football and track,
and to win membership in the two top
engineering scholastic societies.
Mr. Cisler joined the Public Service
Electric and Gas Company of New Jersey
in 1922, the year of his graduation from
college. He quickly rose from a "cadet
engineer" to a well qualified man in full-
scale engineering and administrative prob-
lems.
In 1935, Mr. Cisler was advanced to
the position of General Superintendent of
Electric Generation. A few years later he
was serving as Assistant General Manager
of the Electric Department.
Mr. Cisler joined the Detroit Edison
Company in 1943 and almost simultan-
eously became Colonel Cisler. He was
immediately ordered to the Mediterranean
theater to take charge of smashed electric
power systems. He remained with the
army through Normandy and through the
campaigns in France and Germany. He re-
ceived decorations from the U. S., French,
British, Netherlands, and Belgian gov-
ernments.
Civilian Cisler returned to Detroit Edi-
son as Chief Engineer of Power Plants in
1945. He steadily rose through the ranks
in the company until in 1951 he was
elected President to succeed the retiring

"Basket Handle" Bridge Built in Mexico
Freedom of form previously available
only with concrete, has been achieved
with steel materials in a bridge spanning
the Rio Blanco River near Vera-Cruz,
Mexico.
By applying welding techniques, Mexi-
can engineer, Camilo Piccone, has pro-
jected a span with slender arch ribs, free
of cumbersome bracing. The structure is
based on a new design conception by
Thomas C. Kavanaugh, Head of the De-
partment of Civil Engineering of New
York University's College of Engineering.
The ultra-modern "basket handle" ef-
fect is heightened by the use of color.
Painters have daubed the curved ribs
orange and made the horizontal tie-gird-
ers cherry red. The bridge was opened
last May and motorists who invariably
stop to admire the striking architecture on
their first trip across the span have creat-
ed a minor traffic problem.
The 250-foot long, all-welded steel
splayed-arch highway bridge accommo-
dates three lanes of traffic. The arch ribs
are inclined and joined at the center of
the span. The resulting space framework
produces visually interesting effects from
different angles.
Unconventional design in the Rio
Blanco bridge extends also to the flooring,
where a diagonal gridwork of floor beams
has proved far more economical than usual
bridge floor systems. Its strength and
safety factors are as high as conventional
constructions.
Dr. Kavanaugh's original design con-
ception won an award in the 1951 profes-
sional bridge design competition spon-
"Basket-Handle" Bridge
sored by The Lincoln Arc Welding Foun-
dation of Cleveland, Ohio. Through the
award, Mr. Piccone learned of Dr. Kava-
naugh's design.
The Rio Blanco span, part of the Mexi-
can federal highway system, was con-
structed under the direction of the Papa-
loapan Commission. Contractors and fab-
ricators were the firm of Estructuras, S.
de R. L., of Monterrey.
Upper Atmosphere Research
University of Michigan engineers have
developed a new and simpler means for
obtaining high altitude data for the Army
Signal Corps.
The new method involves dropping a
four-foot, 50-pound nylon sphere through
the atmosphere and measuring its rate of
fall by means of a miniature radar trans-
mitter mounted inside.
The sphere is carried in an Aerobee
rocket to a height of 75 miles, where it is
"kicked out" and inflated before begin-
ning its long fall back to earth. Precision
"tracking" of the miniature radar by
ground radar stations yields data on up-
per air pressures, temperatures and winds.
It has been fired several times at White
Sands Proving Ground, according to Les-
lie M. Jones, project supervisor and re-
search engineer for the U-M Engineering
Research Institute (ERI)
He reveals that independence of sur-
face weather conditions and of rocket
performance, except the altitude of the
rocket, are two of the biggest advantages
of the method. In addition, no recovery
of the recording equipment is required,
since all of the information necessary is
recorded from the radar signals bounced
back from the sphere.
Three Industries Consume 95 Per Cent
of Thermostatic Bimetals Produced

An estimated 95 per cent of all thermo-
static bimetals produced in this country
are used extensively throughout the elec-

used as circuit breakers, indicators and
controls.
Electrical equipment consumes an esti-
mated 40 per cent of the total bimetals
used, the automotive industry 35 per cent,
and 20 per cent is consumed in heating
and ventilating equipment.

that curve because of temperature change.
Research for a material of very low
thermal expansivity, to improve the ac-
curacy of measuring standards, resulted in
the use of nickel and nickel alloys. Alloys
of greater accuracy and durability, with
the capability of wider temperature
ranges, was the goal.
The result: Invar (an iron-base alloy
containing 36 per cent nickel), or one of
its modifications, is commonly employed
as the low expansion element. Comple-
menting this was the development of
nickel-chromium-iron alloys to be used on
the high expansion side of the bimetals.
These applications, plus a new welding
process that used no intermediate bonding
material, have resulted in the safe use of
bimetals at temperatures up to 1000° F.
Twenty-five different alloys of nickel-
iron, nickel-chromium-iron, nickel-chrom-
ium-manganese-copper-iron, etc., are used
to produce 35 different types or combina-
tions of thermostatic bimetal. Nickel con-
tents range from 35 to 100 per cent. They

First Propulsion Equipment Installed for
World's Largest Wind Tunnel
Installation of the most powerful elec-
tric motor ever built—83,000-horsepower
—completes the first major step in assem-
bly of the 216,000-hp electric drive for
the U. S. Air Force's new transonic and
supersonic wind tunnels.
Completion of the two wind tunnels
will permit the testing of full-size jet
engines, guided missiles, and wing sec-
tions and fuselages of aircraft at speeds
up to 2500 miles per hour.
The motor was installed at the Arnold
Engineering Development Center, Tulla-
homa, Tenn. The Center houses important
aeronautical research facilities, available
not only to the Air Force, Army and
Navy, but also to all parties—in govern-
ment, industry, and science—interested in
aircraft development.

Pa. The second unit will be installed in
the near future, along with two 25,000-hp
Westinghouse wound-rotor induction mo-
tors. Each 83,000-hp motor stands 21%-
feet high, and weighs 225 tons. Their
122 ton rotors will turn at 600 revolu-
tions per minute.
In addition to the 2l6,000-hp four-
motor drive, the rotating machine will
have five compressors, now under con-
struction at the Westinghouse plant in
Sunnyvale, Calif. Work on these transonic
and supersonic compressors is not expect-
ed to be completed for at least another
year. The transonic compressor will be a
single unit, but the supersonic compressor
will be made up of four compressors
coupled as one.
Blades for the compressors measure two
feet across the face, are six feet long, and
will be mounted on a spindle 18 ft. in
diameter. Weighing almost two thirds of
a ton each, the blade? will be solid forg-
ings.
Although the machine will have the
highest stored energy of any rotating mass
ever built, it can be brought to a halt in
about three minutes by using its wound
motors as brakes, the energy being dissi-
pated in liquid rheostats.
During operation, the wind tunnels
will require 100,000 gallons of cooling
water per minute to reduce the air dis-
charge temperature to about 600 degrees
F. However, air in the test chamber will
be about 100 degrees F below zero.
The transonic wind tunnel is scheduled
for completion early in 1955. The super-
sonic tunnel will be completed in 1957.

Canada Maintains Position As
Premier Nickel Producer
The important position of Canada in
nickel production—it furnishes over 90
per cent of the free world's output—has
been maintained by the constant effort to
uncover and develop its nickel ore bodies,
to create better methods of getting that
ore out of the earth and to provide
economies in its smelting and refining.

Progress in reactiori'inotor propulsion becomes possi-

the stresses, temperatures, and corrosive attack developed
by new rocket fuels.
Molybdenum additions to many alloys are known to
improve strength at high temperatures. For this reason
Molybdenum will be used more and more in the reaction

activity of the element in the molten
condition presents what appears to be an
insuperable barrier to obtaining pure solid
metal and alloys, for no refractory yet
tested resists attack, resulting in metal
contamination, and, of course, melting
and pouring in the presence of air is im-
possible. The inert-gas-shielded arc-melt-
ing process on a water-cooled copper
hearth is the partial answer. Molten titan-
ium does not wet cold copper, allowing
the purity to be maintained, but at the
expense of ingot homogeneity, for the
amount of metal which can be kept mol-
ten is limited in this technique. Solid
sponge titanium and alloys are fed into
the molten pool while the arc is played
over the surface. As the arc is withdrawn,
the ingot builds up. Although large in-
gots can be made, again the unit cost is
high. Here we need the help of the cera-
mics expert and the process metallurgist.

early promise of versatile heat treatabil-
ity. Figure 1 shows the effect of several
alloys in this reaction. Such a transforma-
tion is the basis of much of the physical
metallurgy of steel, but unlike steel, ti-
tanium alloys are not capable of grain
refinement on reheating through the trans-
formation temperature. The resulting
coarse grained high temperature phase, /?,
leads to brittleness in the treated condi-
tion, so at the present time alloys are
used in the hot-rolled condition giving a
fine grained a + )8 structure, Fig. 2. The
ft phase transforms martensitically when
quenched, Fig. 3, as does austenite in
steel. This product is hard and brittle as in
steel martensite, although not to the same
extent, and can be softened on reheating.
The tempered structure is shown in Fig.
4.
The improvement in properties obtain-
able is not as great as is the case with
steel. Applications at temperatures be-
tween 600 and 1000°F are limited be-
cause of the tendency of alloys to oxidize.
These are incentives for the physical
metallurgist to seek better alloys, better
heat treating, fabricating, and surface
protection methods.
The industrial engineer is rapidly con-
quering an early drawback—lack of
knowledge of suitable forging, machin-
ing, grinding, forming, and deep draw-
ing methods. Many difficulties still exist,
but they are becoming fewer.
The final challenge is to the design
engineers to utilize to the fullest extent

The first submarine installation of a pipe-type
CQPIS SySfSfn was recently installed under the Hudson River
at Poughkeepsie, N.Y. Three cables, each nearly %-miles long,
were simultaneously pulled into a six-inch welded steel pipe laid
across the river bottom. The pipe was then filled with oil main-
tained at 200 lbs. pressure, enabling a 110,000-volt power circuit
to cross the river safely.
This kind of system is called Oilostatic — a design which has long
been first choice among utilities for handling large blocks of power
by means of a high-pressure pipe-type cable system. Increased cir-
cuit reliability and savings on installation and maintenance costs
are realized.
Oilostatic's new role as a submarine cable is typical of the sig-
nificant contributions to better electrical service made by Okonite
engineers. • • •

How to carry a floor charger's
12-ton overhung load
This floor charger charges and levels 12 tons at a
crack in open hearth furnaces. The 12-ton over-
hung load and the terrific shock loads set up by
the charging operation are carried by the peel
shaft bearings. To take these loads and to keep
the charger in top operating shape, design en-
gineers specify Timken® tapered roller bearings.
Line contact gives TIMKEN" bearings
extra load-carrying capacity
In Timken bearings, the load is carried on a line of contact
between the rollers and races instead of being concentrated
at a single point. Rollers and races are case-carburized to give
a hard, wear-resistant surface over a tough, shock-resistant
core. And to be sure of getting the highest quality bearing
steel, the Timken Company makes its own.

FOR LOWER
STRUCTURAL COSTS
WITH today's accent on cost,
there is a promising future for
the designer who can simplify struc-
tural designs to save steel and con-
struction manhours. Such savings are
being realized every day by the use
of arc welding instead of riveting
in the construction of all types of
industrial plants, multi-story build-
ings and bridges. By eliminating
rivets and taking advantage of rigid
framing and continuous beam con-
struction, welded designs help to
offset the rising costs in labor and
materials.
Shown below is a typical example
of how full structural continuity
achieved through arc welding effect-
ed savings of $22,000 in the con-
struction of an 87,000 square foot
process warehouse. Arc welding
actually has saved 1.68 pounds of
steel per square foot. At $0.15 per
pound for fabricated steel, the sav-
ing amounts to $22,000 over the
cost of steel alone had riveted design
been used.
In spite of the rapid progress
made in the construction field by
the welding industry, new develop-
ments are taking place every day
which are of prime importance to
the structural engineering graduate.
Latest information on welded struc-
tural designs is available in hand-
books and bulletins simply by writ-
ing to The Lincoln Electric Com-
pany, Cleveland 17, Ohio.

you needed him. Hoover was always the
man with the workable plan. You cannot
put a dollars and cents sign on the hu-
manitarian phase of Hoover's contribu-
tions to society any more than you can
put a value on the life of a man. To be
sure, millions owe their lives to this kind-
ly Quaker. Millions might have starved
but for Hoover. In Hoover's four year
stretch as president, it is doubtful that
any man could have done more. The de-
pression of the thirties continued during
the Democratic party's administration, un-
til shortly before the outbreak of war in
1941.
The Social Contributions of Herbert
Hoover in Later Life
Herbert Hoover, as has always been
his wont, remained active in public life
after his defeat as president. He became
interested in libraries and was instru-
mental in organizing the Hoover War
Library which is dedicated to the idea that
the very first of all the problems pressing
upon the human race is the problem of
prevention of war. He became active in
Boys Club affairs. At various times he
headed smaller private relief organiza-
tions. He organized and directed the very
first effort on a national scale to relieve
distress abroad following the outbreak of
World War II (^ft Finnish Relief). In
February 1946, soon after Mr. Hoover
gave support to President Truman's appeal
to the world to save food, the President
asked Mr. Hoover to recommend a com-
prehensive program designed to alleviate
world famine conditions. He provided an
invaluable report on these conditions after
an exhaustive fifty-seven day trip through-
out the world. But even more important
were the recommendations of the Hoover
Commission on government reorganiza-
tion. Congress appointed Hoover chair-
man of this committee in 1947. The
Hoover Commission report came out in
favor of a number of reforms in various
branches of the government which would
render it more efficient, economical and
effective. It resulted from a survey of
government which took well over two
years to make. This last contribution has
been labeled as one of the most significant
made by Hoover. It will serve not only as
a blueprint for good government today
but also as a guide for good government
tomorrow.
A Summation of the Social Contribu-
tions of Herbert Hoover
Herbert Hoover has probably done
more for the people of this world than
any man living today. Through his efforts
millions were saved from starvation.
Hoover devoted a lifetime to helping
others.
Hoover carried through much govern-
ment reform. Graft was weeded out and
administrative red tape eliminated during
his four year term as president. The re-
port of the Hoover Commission on im-
proving government has been hailed by
many as the most significant contribution
to the advancement of good government
since the Civil War.
In his earlier years Hoover through his
efforts increased the income of more than
a score of nations. This increase of inter-
national wealth was met by a commen-
surable increase in living standards of
various nations. Hoover also made many
contributions to the field of mining engi-
neering.
In short, the social contributions of Mr.
Hoover were multifarious. In dollars and
cents his contributions to society in terms
of service rendered are inestimable. Few
men have served their countries so long,
so hard, and so well. In the intangible
currencies of the thanks of millions of
grateful people and of the satisfaction in
doing something to help his fellow man,
Herbert Hoover's coffers runneth over.
Many men reach the top in their re-
spective engineering fields, but there has
been only one engineer-president of the
United States—Herbert Hoover who
reached the top in whatever he turned
his hand to. Such has been the life of
Hoover, one of the most dynamic figures
of the country. The story of Herbert
Hoover is a typical American success
story. Hoover was cast of the same coin
as Abraham Lincoln, dedicated to the aid
of humanity. Born of poor parents,
through hard work and perseverence,
Hoover scaled great heights.

exactly one mile, 5280 feet in length. For
some reason, at the end of the day, they
left one rail staked only at the ends. The
next day was Sunday, and was very warm.
The increased temperature caused the rail
to expand exactly one foot in length, or
until it was 5281 feet long. Now since it

the desirable properties of titanium al-
loys while compensating for their faults.
Certainly the corrosion resistance of ti-
tanium and its alloys merit their wide
application in the chemical and oil refin-
ing industries. The disappointing fatigue
properties, particularly with reference to
notch sensitivity and surface conditions,
must be borne in mind. The high creep
rate at low temperatures is surprising for
such a high melting metal and must be
provided for. The oxidation tendency
previously mentioned and the accompany-
ing loss of strength at elevated tempera-
tures cannot be ignored.
It is easily seen that some of the glitter
attached to titanium alloys when interest
first developed because of a few outstand-
ing properties has been worn off with the
growing awareness of the problems enum-
erated. The attractiveness of the original
promise has not dimmed, however, and
engineering technology will surely bring
it to full fruition, thereby placing into
our hands another versatile, valuable engi-
neering metal.

REDUCING THE COST OF
ATOMIC POWER
In addition to generating electricity,
future atomic power plants may produce
plutonium for use in atomic bombs, or as
fuel in other atomic power plants. Ra-
diation for sterilizing food and drug
products might go a long way toward
balancing the high cost of atomic fuels,
and making atomic power economical.
An atomic power plant could produce
plutonium or other atomic fuel as a by-
product of power making, and such new
fuel could then be used for generating
still more electric power. This method
would conserve the supply of natural
atomic fuels, and help reduce costs, but
so long as the present military and po-
litical situation continues, plutonium has
a much greater value as bomb material.
Thus, the manufacture of bomb pluton-
ium offers at least transitory assistance in
balancing the budget. In addition, it has
been proposed that something be done
with the huge quantities of gamma rays,
similar to X-rays, which are produced by
an atomic reactor as a now useless by-
product. Scientists in other laboratories
have demonstrated experimentally that
gamma rays may be used to sterilize drugs
such as penicillin and certain foods, with
a view to keeping them longer. The ex-
tent of the possible application depends
first on proving that the process has no
harmful effects in human consumption,
and then on how cheaply it can be done;
that is, on the cost of shielding and of the
remote control equipment for exposing
the objects to be sterilized.
The uranium or other fuel used in an
atomic power plant is simply a source of
heat, which can be used to make steam to
drive turbine-generators. So that the water
itself does not become dangerously radio-
active, as it would if exposed directly to
the splitting atoms, some heat-transfer
medium must be interposed to take heat
from the reactor to the boiler where
water is turned into steam. Liquid sodium,
which will melt at the temperature of
boiling water, will meet many of the re-
quirements for this heat-carrying job.

Professor Alfred Homes White died
very suddenly on August 25, 1953, at the
age of eighty. We all remember him as
the kindly, white haired professor in room
3026 in the East Engineering building,
and as author of the book, Engineering
Materials. However, Professor White's
prime interest was in chemical engineer-
ing and his greatest contribution was his
pioneer work in establishing a Chemical
Engineering Department here at the Uni-
versity.
Professor White was born in Peoria,
Illinois, April 12, 1873. He received his
early training in the Peoria Schools. He
attended McGill University in Montreal
one year before coming to the University
of Michigan. He received an A.B. degree
here in 1893. At Polytcchnicum in Zurich,
Switzerland, he specialized in chemical
technology. At that time he was made as-
sistant in chemistry at the University of
Illinois. White returned to the University
of Michigan in 1897 to become an in-
structor in chemical technology. He was
made assistant professor in 1904, junior
professor in 1907, and professor in 1911.
For several years he was head of the
Chemical Engineering Department and
Metallurgical Engineering Department.
Professor White was a military man as
well as an instructor. On leave of absence,
May 1917 to July 1919, he served his
country as captain and later lieutenant
colonel in the ordnance Department,
U.S.A.. Chief Research Section, Nitrate
Division. He was associate chief of the
nitrate division. Professor White was
classed as a consulting engineer in the
Ordnance Department from August 19,
1919 to date. He also served as consultant
to the Bureau of Mines.
At the University of Michigan Profes-
sor A. H. White developed the first
Chemical Engineering Department in the
country. He wrote about one hundred re-
search papers and technical journals on:
manufacturing and testing illuminating
gas; manufacture and properties of port-
land cement; and fixation of nitrogen. He
also wrote a book entitled Technical Gas
and Fuel Analysis.
Professor White was president of the
American Institute of Chemical Engineers
and president of the Michigan branch of
Phi Beta Kappa. Other clubs of which he
A. H. White
was a member include the American
Chemical Society, American Society for
Testing Materials, American Gas Institute,
Society for Promotion of Engineering
Education, American Institute of Consult-
ing Engineers, Alpha Chi Sigma, Phi
Sigma Kappa, Sigma Xi, Phi Lambda Up-
silon, Research Club, and the Society of
American Engineers. Here in Ann Arbor,
he belonged to the American Legion,
Rotary, and served on the City Council.
White was chairman of the Classification
Committee and a member of the Commit-
tee on Student Affairs.
Profesior A. H. White retired in 1943
and was made Professor Emeritus of
Chemical Engineering and later became
president of the Emeritus Club at the
University of Michigan. In 1948 he re-
ceived the honorary degree of Doctor of
Engineering from the University of De-
troit.
Surviving are his wife, the former Re-
becca Downey, who he married July 28,
1903. His daughter Mary Julian is a
physician in Washington, D.C. His only
son Alfred McLaren White was a grad-
uate from the University of Michigan and
was head of the Department of Chemical
Engineering at the University of Virginia
when he died at the age of twenty-eight
in 1936.

strength and shock resistance re-
quired to safely cushion the landing
impact of 179 tons of bomber weight
—and, at the same time, to keep
the weight of the landing gear as low
as possible—calls not only for steel
of the highest quality but also for
unusual procedures in fabrication as
well.
Consider these facts. The original
ingot weighs approximately 37,500
lbs. From it are produced two cylin-
drical columns weighing only about
1200 lbs. apiece. Approximately 93%
of the steel is removed by machining
to proper contour and in hollow-
boring the column. When finished, a
mere 7 % of the original ingot is left
to do the job.
That U-S-S Carilloy steel has
been exclusively selected for this ap-
plication—one of the most exacting
in the aircraft industry—is, we be-
lieve, highly significant. The same
care and skill, the same ability to
meet requirements that are beyond
the ordinary, go into every order of
Carilloy steel we make—whether
it's an ingot of giant size or a few
tons of special steel.
U-S-S Carilloy is just one more
example of the better steel products
developed and produced by United
States Steel. If you are interested in
additional engineering training, why
not investigate your opportunities
with U. S. Steel? For more informa-

You'll be at the head of the jet parade at Boeing
For long-range opportunities, it's hard to
beat the jet aircraft field. If you want to
get into this exciting branch of engineer-
ing after you graduate, get in at the
head of the parade—at Boeing.
Through the fighter-fast B-47 six-jet
bomber, and the giant new eight-jet B-52,
Boeing has acquired more experience de-
signing, flying and building multi-jet
aircraft than any other company, either
here or abroad. In addition, Boeing is
the first American company to announce
its entry into the jet transport field.
Engineering graduates will find in
the aviation industry an unusually wide
range of experience, and great breadth
of application — from pure research to
production design, all going on at once.
Boeing is constantly alert to new tech-
niques and materials, and approaches
them without limitations. Extensive sub-
contracting and major procurement pro-
grams, all directed and controlled by
engineers, afford varied experience and
broad contacts and relationships.
Aircraft development is such an inte-
gral part of our national life that young
graduates can enter it with full expecta-
tion of a rewarding, long-term career.
Boeing, now in its 37th year of opera-
tion, employs more engineers today than
even at the peak of World War II. Its
projects include guided missiles, research
on supersonic flight and nuclear power
for aircraft.
Boeing engineering activity is concen-
trated at Seattle in the Pacific Northwest,
and Wichita in the Midwest. These
communities offer a wide variety of rec-
reational opportunities. Both are fresh,
modern cities with fine residential sec-
tions and shopping districts, and schools
of higher learning where engineers can
study for advanced degrees.
There are openings in ALL branches
of engineering (mechanical, civil, elec-
trical, aeronautical, and related fields),
for DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION,
RESEARCH and TOOLING. Also for servo-
mechanism and electronics designers and
analysts, and physicists and mathemati-
cians with advanced degrees.

National Bureau of Standards
In recent years radiant glass heating
panels have come into increasing use for
heating residences and other small build-
ings. This type of panel was recently
studied under controlled conditions by
Paul R. Achenbach of the National Bu-
reau of Standards under the sponsorship
of the Housing and Home Finance
Agency. The results of these tests indi-
cated that electrically-heated radiant glass
panels constitute a satisfactory method of
warming a basementless house. However,
even with the house thoroughly insulated,
electric heating can be expected to entail
higher annual heating costs in most areas
than would coal, oil, or gas because use-
ful heat derived from electricity has a
higher unit cost than that produced from
these common fuels.
The tests were conducted in the NBS
Test Bungalow, a small one-story house
of four rooms and bath, with a hallway
near the middle of the structure connect-
ing the rooms. For the purposes of these
tests the house was treated as basement-
less. The Test Bungalow is completely en-
closed in an insulated structure with a five
foot space between outside bungalow
walls and the inner walls of the enclosure.
Unit coolers in the enclosure allow the
control of outdoor temperatures. Thermo-
couples, suspended at various levels
throughout the house, were used with in-
dicating and recording equipment to ob-
serve the temperature distribution in the
house.
The typical radiant glass panel is
mounted on a metal frame and backed by
a reflective shield from which it is sep-
arated by a small air space. A metallic
coating on the rear surface of the glass
serves as the electric conductor and heat-
ing element. The output per panel is
typically about 1000 watts, although units
with lower wattage ratings are available
from some manufacturers. Panels are de-
signed for either 115 or 230 volts AC,
and are made for mounting beneath win-
dows, as baseboard units, or as vertical
units adjacent to window frames.
Heat is transmitted from glass heating
panels primarily by radiation and convec-
tion. When the panel is heated above the
room air temperature, heated air passes
upward over the face of the panel,
through the space between the glass and
the reflective shield, and between the
shield and the frame of the panel as-
sembly. At the same time, radiant heat is
emitted outward from the face of the
panel. The passage of air through the
spaces back of the glass keeps the tem-
perature of the rear of the assembly cool
enough to allow it to be in contact with
combustible materials.
For some of the tests, the bungalow
was insulated with 3% inches of rock
wool laid on the upper side of the ceiling
of the living quarters and one inch of
rigid fiber board insulation nailed to the
bottom of the floor joints, and the win-
dows and doors were weatherstripped.
The bungalow with this amount of insu-
lation was considered as "uninsulated."
For the remainder of the tests, the stud
spaces of the walls of the bungalow were
filled with expanded-mica insulation, and
plastic-filled wire mesh screen cloth was
tacked over the outside of the window
frames to simulate storm windows. With
this additional insulation, the house was
considered "insulated."
Ten radiant glass heating panels were
installed in the Test Bungalow at the be-
ginning of the tests. Two of these were
placed under the double window of the
living room, one under the single window
of the living room, and one under each
of the other windows of the bungalow,
making a total of three panels in the liv-
ing room, two in the kitchen, two in the
north bedroom, two in the south bed-
room, and one in the bathroom all lo-
cated just above the floor level. The
panels were rated at 1000 watts at 230
volts, but were actually operated on a
208-volt power supply corresponding to
a capacity of approximately 820 watts.
The panels in each room were connected
to separate electrical circuits and the room
temperature of each room was controlled
by means of an individual thermostat
and relay.
The initial power demand for the
panels was about 145 per cent of the
steady demand after the panel became
thoroughly heated. Approximately 20
minutes were required after starting to
attain steady power demand and approxi-
mately 30 minutes were required to attain
a steady temperature on the exposed glass
surface. The temperatures at the centers
of the glass plates operating at rated vol-
tage averaged about 340°F.
The temperatures observed in the Test
Bungalow for eleven different test condi-
tions with constant outdoor temperatures
in the range from 0° to 32°F show that
the vertical temperature differences in the
living zone (2 to 60 inches above the
floor) were moderately low, ranging from
3.5 deg. F for an outdoor temperature of
32°F to 7.0 deg. F for an outdoor tem-
perature of 0°F. Thus, the temperature
gradient in the living zone was 0.7 deg.
F per foot of height at the higher outdoor
temperature and 1.4 deg. F per foot of
height at the lower outdoor temperature.
The average gradient from floor to ceiling
was a little lower than in the living zone,
ranging from 0.6 deg F per foot for an
outdoor temperature of 32°F to 1.1 deg.
F per foot for an outdoor temperature of
0°F.
The vertical temperature differences in
the living zone with the radiant glass
panels were about one to 2°F greater than
those observed in the same house with a
baseboard convector heating system. In-
sulating the walls and adding storm win-
dows did not significantly change the ver-
tical temperature differences observed in
this house. Since the same number of
panels were in operation in the insulated
and uninsulated condition of the house,
the percent of time during which the
heaters were energized was appreciably
less in the insulated house. Consequently,
the chimney effect of the house and nat-
ural convection played a more signifi-
cant role in the insulated house during the
longer periods when the heaters were not
energized than in the uninsulated house.
The average horizontal temperature
variation between stations of observation
within individual rooms was 1.6°F for an
outdoor temperature of 32°F and 2.6°F
for an outdoor temperature of 0°F when
the differences at all five levels of observa-
tion were averaged together for each
room. However, the horizontal tempera-
ture differences within the rooms were
consistently greater at 2 inches and 30
inches above the floor than at the higher
levels of observation, since the electric-
panels were located below the 30-inch
level and emitted more radiant heat to

BY
A. D. MOORE, Professor of Electrical Engineering
You do not know how to write a job-
hunting letter. That goes, literally, for
nine of you out of ten. And you had bet-
ter learn. Last week I sat in the office of
a Detroit business man who had adver-
tised for an engineering sales assistant.
He showed me a stack of letters of ap-
plication. Except for about two letters,
the stack was not worth the trouble in-
volved in pushing it into the waste basket.
When you write that letter, either con-
form to business usage and put it on 8.5
by 11, or don't write it. Never write it
on someone else's stationery. Ordinary
business correspondence never appears
except in typed form. Neither should
yours. You may type the letter yourself if
you can do a good job that is no com-
promise with shoddiness in any respect;
otherwise, get somebody to type it for
you. Let handwriting be but a reluctantly
adopted alternative. If you must write by
hand, either do a good job or let it go.
Imagination and the creative instinct
are valuable assets, but not when applied
to the formal parts of a letter of appli-
cation. Please, please do not assume that
you know all about this letter business.
Get a copy of Hadida's Pitfalls in English
(Putnam) or some such manual, and find
out exactly how these things are done.
While on a tender subject, what of your
spelling? Think of the graduates who
have written back to me and spelled it
"Proffesor." Note the many seniors who
write "proceedure." Dwell on the case of
the man who spends four years playing
with our apparatus, and still writes and
speaks of "lavatory," meaning labora-
tory. The pertinent question is: are you
wise enough to know that your spelling
is shaky somewhere, and do you know
enough to have a friend check over your
letters before you send them?
Letter Content
Design the letter with care. Very often,
the purpose of the letter is to secure an
interview. The almost invariable rule: no
interview, no job. Hiring sight unseen is
extremely rare. When your letter gets
there, it is the only thing there to repre-
sent you. Unless it is one of the few that
A. D. Moore
commands attention and earns respect,
you are accepting an almost insurmount-
able handicap from the very start. The
interview is not granted. Or if it is, the
employer is likely to sit before you, con-
stantly reminding himself that "this is
the chap who used his girl's perfumed
stationery; his fountain pen ran out half-
way, making it a two-color job; he failed
to get my title right; he ended in a rush
with 'Very truly yrs.'; yes, I remember this
man's letter."
What to say? So many exceptions come
in, that the subject is too broad to attempt
writing comprehensive rules here. Care-
fully think out the minimum require-
ments; find the things you must say, then
say them concisely and clearly. Beyond
such a limit you hardly dare go, unless
you are one of the few, blessed with
imagination, good taste, and maturity of
judgment, who knows he can add touches
lending a personal distinction to an other-
wise prosaic document. If you can do this,
it is invaluable. If not, emphatically do
not try it; it would turn an otherwise suc-
cessful business letter into something
ludicrous.
Some day, as an engineer, you will have
to send an engineering report by mail.
The situation also calls for a letter of
transmittal. You would not dream of
thinking that, since you must write a let-
ter anyway, you should recast the whole
report and shove it bodily into the letter
of transmittal. Now, a similar mistake can
be made if you try to cram all the factual
data about yourself into your letter of ap-
plication. If you had an engineering re-
port on yourself, you would mail it to the
employer, and your letter of transmittal
would become a letter of application. This
brings us to—
The Typed Personal Record
The personnal record may be thought
of as a special form of engineering re-
port. Its subject is—you. It is typed. It
is in outline form. Every item is so pre-
sented as to be easily found. It must al-
ways give the minimum required facts. It
may contain more, depending on your
judgment. The form, the general appear-
ance, the sequence of classifications—
these constitute a make-up or design that
should be your own. A wide latitude exists
within which your material can be suit-
ably arranged. Do not make your job
look exactly like one you have seen; con-
scientiously make it your own, to give it
individuality. That the paper should be
standard size need not be mentioned.
The personal record may vary from one
to five pages in length. Many recent
graduates who have filed records with me
usually manage to cover between one and
two pages. A. graduate ten years out may
have to adopt an ingenious tabulating
scheme to compress his varied experiences
into an acceptably short document.
The record serves at least three needs.
It enables you, perhaps for the first time,
to know your own experience, training,
education, and value. When a copy is filed
with your faculty placement officer, you
are giving him just the fine cooperation
he needs in helping to place you now or
later. And a copy placed with the em-
ployer presents you to him in the form of
a high-grade report. These needs indicate
the content.
Content of the Personal Record
1. Photograph. Perhaps the home town
paper honored your departure for college
with a story, and wisely included a pic-
ture to prove to the incredulous that there
was no mistake in identity. Of course, you
12
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


saved a clipping. Leave it intact; that
half-tone print will not serve here. As a
senior, you are being photographed for
the Ensian, to a size of 4 by 6. In gen-
eral, that is too large. Get a relatively in-
expensive photograph made, size 3 by 4
or a little smaller. Never send a snapshot
or a bad photograph; omit entirely rather
than compromise. Never place the pic-
ture on the record so that it will be
folded and creased in mailing.
2. Personal Facts. Such items as name,
address, telephone number, date of the
record itself, your age at that date, place
of birth, height, weight, state of health
whether married, whether there are chil-
dren or other dependents—these usually
head the record in outline form.
3. Affiliations. Memberships in honor
and professional societies are given.
4. Education, Training. The high school
may or may not be mentioned. The col-
lege, degree, and date of graduation must
be given. A breath-taking omission oc-
curred when one of our graduates remem-
bered everything except to say in his
record, that he ever graduated anywhere.
Advanced degrees are of course mention-
ed. Any special training, such as one gets
within numerous industrial training set-
ups, is set forth.
Under Education, some go so far as to
list all college courses taken. Probably the
typical employer would consider this as
going too far with detail. However, a se-
lected list of courses considered most
valuable and which might be most pertin-
ent for a certain kind of employment
ought to go in.
5. Experience. Err on the side of com-
pleteness. Tell the jobs you have held be-
fore, during, and after college. One little
item, such as selling groceries one sum-
mer may seem insignificant to you; it may
turn out to be the very thing that separates
you from the group of applicants and
hands you the job. Selling groceries is
sales experience, it means getting along
with fellow hustlers, and it involves meet-
ing the customers—pleasant, cantanker-
ous, and all kinds between. Did you earn
college expenses on some menial job in
the hospital? Then you are one of the
very few graduates having any kind of
extended hospital contact whatever. A
manufacturer of therapeutic apparatus
might want you for design, development,
or sales. Companies making unusual
finishes, paints, flooring materials, sound
absorption materials, surgical supplies—
all these would prefer a man who had
happened to spend four years working

6. Activities. (Remember, the sequence
of divisions is up to you; if you prefer
to list Activities right below Education,
do so. I'm putting them here to be sure
they get into the story.) Class offices,
memberships and offices held in societies
and student activities—all should be men-
tioned. Does every employer expect that
all his recruited graduates shall have a
long record of activities? Not at all. Some
would pay no attention to it. A few might
even object to it, when looking for a cer-
tain type of men. Most of them will tol-
erate a decent amount of activity back-
ground, and many will insist on some.
7. New Objects Planned, Designed, or
Built. Here we come to the gadgets. Many
seniors have been tinkering for years,
planning or building model engines,
model airplanes, radio sets, and so on.
Make clear those that were really built,
as against those that never got beyond the
design stage. The late B. G. Lamme, so
long and so eminently the chief engineer
for Westinghouse Electric, interviewed
thousands of graduates. He always in-
quired into this kind of self-imposed ac-
tivity. He considered it essential to the
make-up of every to-be-successful engi-
neer. It may well be that he gave the mat-
ter undue emphasis; but due to his in-
fluence, you may be assured that many
employers of engineers think the same
way about it.
8. Special interests. You can bring
these out strikingly, in part, by putting
red stars on those courses (under Educa-
tion) whose content most represents the
lines you wish to follow. A footnote can
explain the stars. Then, in a paragraph or
two, state your special interests. One of
our men roomed in the house of a mar-
ried "Medic" student; due to long talk-
fests there, and other particular motiva-
tions, he took an unusual dose of work in
the Arts college. He wound up with a per-
manent and informed interest in sociol-
ogy, mental hygiene, medicine, medical
apparatus; and said so in his personal
record. Another man stated that he had
been reading Lester's Marketing Indus-

WALTER RING, '57E
Germany, during World War I, was
the first nation to use cemented carbide
as a substitute for industrial diamonds.
The diamonds because of their hardness
were used in tool tips and dies. However,
when Germany was blockaded the dia-
mond source was stopped. But the pro-
duction of tool parts was not stopped
because the solution to their problem was
the manufacture of cemented carbide
(tungsten carbide), the hardest material
ever made by man. Therefore, the purpose
of this article is to describe the manufac-
ture and applications of this product.
The basic ingredients of cemented car-
bides are tungsten powder, carbon 'lamp-
black) and cobalt powder. The first step
in the manufacture is the formation of
Fig. I: Ingredients of tungsten carbide are being carefully weighed.
tungsten carbide. Figure 1 illustrates the
care taken in weighing out the tungsten
and lampblack powder in definite pro-
portions. The mixture is then placed in a
rotating drum and is allowed to mix. The
mixing may require a few hours in order
that the contents become a fine homogene-
ous powder.
The next operation is to have the two
ingredients combine chemically. This is
done by placing the powder mixture into
a carbon box which is also known as a
boat and is heated to a high temperature.
The type of furnace used is shown in
Figure 2. To prevent the formation of a
metallic oxide, the powder is heat treated
in a hydrogen atmosphere. When the ma-
terial comes from the furnace, the product

powder has caked but it is easily broken
up to a powder form again.
One of the physical characteristics of
this powder is its extreme hardness. If
this powder was used to make briquettes,
the tools would wear out very soon. Co-
balt powder is added so that the briquettes
can be made easily. Another role which
cobalt plays is to cement the carbide when
it is in its final sintering operation.
After the cobalt is added to the carbide
powder, the mixture is placed into an-
other rotating drum as shown in Figure 3.
This process is called ball milling. Mill-
ing brings the desired grain size as well
as coating the carbide with cobalt. This

operation may require a few hours or a
few days.
Once grain size is obtained, a lubricant
such as camphor, parafin, or stearic acid is
added to make the powder suitable to
mold. A die cavity is filled with the
powder and pressure is applied. The com-
pact or briquette, is very fragile but is
made hard by sintering.
The briquettes are packed into a carbon
boat and are slowly moved along the
different temperature zones of the furnace,
thereby increasing slowly the temperature
until final sintering occurs. The gradual
moving of the boat is continued through
the furnace until it reaches the cooling
zone. After the material is cooled, it is
removed from the furnace.

boat into a furnace. Hydrogen atmosphere
is still used to prevent oxidation of the
parts. Shrinkage is large in sintering.
However, the density of the part is in-
creased as well as the strength. This en-
ables the part to have a good cutting edge
which cannot be easily broken or chipped.
Figure 6 shows how the tool tip is
placed onto a steel shank. A diamond
wheel is used to form a cutting edge on

Other applications for use of cemented
carbides are electrical contacts where high
temperatures will not melt the material
and cause it to fail.

It is interesting to note that the blanks shrink approximately
40% in volume going through the sintering furnace

During World War II, cemented
carbides were employed in front of the-
battle lines as well as behind. Thousands
of anti-tank shells and armor piercing
bullets were fired. This type of ammuni-
tion was very effective. While on the home-
front, machine parts and weapons were
made by tool tips and cutting edges.
Thousands of miles of wire were drawn
through cemented carbide dies.
There is being done a tremendous
amount of research to improve the cutting
qualities of this material. The machining
problems of today will be solved in the
near future. Metallurgists will be able to
produce harder and stronger alloys which
can be machined by the carbides.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Royale, a small island which, although
it is close to the Canadian shore, is part
of the State of Michigan. Noted for its
scenic wilderness, Isle Royale is maintain-
ed as a national park.
But Isle Royale is important for an-
other reason. Native copper deposits
found on Michigan's Upper Peninsula are
also found on the island, and these de-
posits were mined by pre-historic men
long before America was discovered by
Europeans. Evidence of their mining ven-
tures are the hundreds of pits dotting
Isle Royale and the Keweenaw Peninsula.
Native copper, relatively pure, metallic
copper, was mined by these primitive
people for use chiefly in ornaments and
ceremonial objects and for some use in
spears, darts, and daggers.
The mining techniques of these men,
although crude in comparison with mod-
ern mining methods, were very effective.
The copper is found, in this area, in
metallic veins or pockets outcropping on
the surface in hard rock in many places.
In order to free the copper, the rock first
had to be broken away. Having no effec-
tive tools for this, the miners built fires
on the veins and, after the rock was hot
enough, quenched the rock with icy
water carried from nearby Lake Superior.
This contraction of the surrounding rock
freed the copper. Small pieces of rock
still adhering to the copper were broken
away by crude hammerstones, hundreds of
which have been found in the long, shal-
low Isle Royale excavations. In some in-
stances the miners encountered masses of
copper too large to be easily removed.
The wooden levers and supports with
which they attempted to raise these masses
from the pits have been found with the
copper still on top of them.
The problem of the anthropologists has
been to find out more about these prehis-
toric miners and determine the time at
which the pits were dug. The Indians of
this area, when it was first discovered by
white men, had no legends about the
miners and knew nothing of their exis-
tence. The fact that there are neither hu-
man remains nor habitation sites having
homes or pottery of the miners further
complicates the quest of the anthropolog-
ists. Nor can the date of the pits be de-

termined by specific characteristics of the
hammerstones, for they are of too crude
and too generalized a type.
The sleuth in the Isle Royale time
mystery is an outgrowth of atomic re-
search—radioactive carbon dating tech-
niques. This recent addition to the tools
of anthropology has become invaluable
in dating fairly recent but prehistoric car-
bonaceous relics, although more is yet to
be done to perfect its accuracy. Radiocar-
bon techniques can be employed in dating
relics from the last 20,000 years of man's
history, accurate within a few hundred
years.
It is the "ticking" of the isotopic car-
bon clock which allows any plant or
animal relic to be dated. Cosmic rays from
outer space, constantly bombarding our
atmosphere, smash atmospheric atoms
and release neutrons. These neutrons, in
turn, react chiefly with nitrogen nuclei to
form the radioactive carbon 14 isotope.
The rate of decay of radiocarbon is equal
to the rate of production by cosmic rays,
keeping the atmospheric concentration
constant. The radiocarbon thus formed is
quickly oxidized to radioactive carbon
dioxide, which is absorbed by plants. The
concentration of radiocarbon in live plants
is equal to the concentration of radio-
carbon in the atmosphere, since the atmo-
sphere is the source of all plants' car-
bon. It follows that animals, which de-
pend upon plants for food, would also
have a radiocarbon content equal to that
of plants and the atmosphere.
As long as plants and animals are liv-
ing, their radiocarbon contents remain
constant. At their death, however, intake
of carbon ceases, and the radiocarbon
clock within them begins to tick off the
years. The half-life of carbon 14, the
time required for half of its atoms to
disintegrate, is calculated to be 5,568±
30 years. By measuring the present rate of
disintegration of the radiocarbon in the
once-living relic, the age of that relic can
be determined rather closely.
The radiocarbon dating techniques, dis-
covered in 1946 by Dr. Willard F. Libby
of the University of Chicago and employ-
ed at the University of Michigan in con-
nection with the Michigan-Memorial
Phoenix Project under the direction of
Dr. H. R. Crane of the Physics Depart-
ment, are complicated by many problems.
One of the primary problems of the dat-
ing methods is the reduction of back-
ground radiation from local radioactivity
and from cosmic rays. Since the concen-
tration of carbon 14 in the atmosphere is
very small (1.25% of the total carbon
in the atmosphere), the dating apparatus
must be extremely accurate.
The dating apparatus consists of a
long, seamless, sealed tube in which are
mounted three samples—one of dead
carbon from coal (deposited so long ago
that the atoms of radioactive carbon have
completely disintegrated), one of con-
temporary carbon from recently grown
wood, and one of the material to be test-
ed. It is only through a comparison of
the counts of all three samples that an ac-
curate determination can be made. In pre-
paring the samples every precaution is
taken to separate any other naturally oc-
curring radioactive substances, such as
potassium, thorium, or uranium, which
would make it impossible to take an ac-
curate radiocarbon count. Each of the
samples in turn, for carefully timed
periods, have their radiocarbon count
taken. The apparatus is shielded from
outside radioactivity by heavy iron plate.
The dating apparatus is still in the de-
velopmental stage. Its accuracy is good, as
proved by tests on samples of definitely
fixed age, and is being improved rapidly.
The anthropologists' radiocarbon sleuth
has dated the mysterious miners of Isle
Royale. Professor J. B. Griffin and a
group from the University of Michigan
Museum and Professor R. H. Dreier and
a group from the Michigan College of
Mining and Technology last June con-
ducted a expedition to an Isle Royale
primitive mine site. The purpose of the
expedition was to unearth charcoal of
fires of wood used in these early mining
ventures. At a depth of seven feet below
the level of the excavation, a piece of
wood used by the ancient miners was
found. Brought back to Ann Arbor, the
sample was tested by the radiocarbon
dating techniques. The age of the wood
was found to be 3000± years. Copper
was being mined on Isle Royale about
1000 BC. Radiocarbon dating has written
a new chapter in the anthropological his-
tory of North America.

GEORGE W. ONKSEN, Guide Lamp Division,
General Motors Corporation
Headlamp glare has been a continuing
problem ever since electric headlamps
have been used on automobiles. A beam
which illuminates the road far ahead for
safe driving is too bright for the ap-
proaching driver.
The first headlamps had only one beam.
Control was attained by a resistor which
was switched in and out of an electric
circuit to make the beam dim for ap-
proaching cars. Later, two beams were
used: an upper beam designed for clear
road driving and a lower beam designed
to reduce glare when passing.
As the years passed, headlamps were
standardized, accuracy was improved, and
inspection and service facilities were de-
veloped with the result that today the
glare problem is largely a matter of prop-
er headlamp usage.
Open road driving conditions change
so rapidly, however, that the correct
choice of beam calls for rather careful at-
tention on the part of the driver. All
drivers are not willing to devote that
much attention to the job. A few drivers
do not dim until they are signaled, and
many drive constantly on their lower
beams to avoid using the foot switch.
Both habits are dangerous. Experience in-
dicates that it is difficult to get drivers to
pay more attention to their driving, either
through education or law enforcement.
Forty million cars were using the high-
ways at the end of 1952, which was about
40 per cent more than during the first
post war year of 1946. Present traffic vol-
umes, then, point to the desirability of an
automatic method to control headlamp
glare for the safety and convenience of
American motorists. Automatic headlamp
control by means of the Autronic-Eye
automatic headlamp control was intro-
duced on certain 1952 models of General
Motors cars.
The design goals for the Autronic-Eye
control were to utilize a light measuring
device to achieve complete headlamp con-
trol under widely varying conditions.
Some of the conditions which the final
design had to meet were:
«. The device should switch to the lower
beam promptly when subjected to suffi-
cient light, and should switch back to
the upper beam promptly when light is
removed.
• The device should retain the lower
beam when the approaching driver
dims.
• The device should dim for cars on
curves but should not dim excessively
for extraneous light at the roadside.
• The driver should be able to switch to
the lower beam for city use and for
following another car when there is
insufficient light to retain the lower
beam automatically.
• The driver should be able to obtain
the upper beam for signaling and for
travelling at dusk when there is too
much light from the sky for the device
to switch to the upper beam automat-
ically.
• The device should not be impaired
when operated in the daytime.
For a considerable number of years,
automotive engineers have been convinced
that automatic headlamp control devices
offered possibilities for solving the glare
problem—if such devices could be made
to function properly. The outlook was far
from encouraging, considering that the
brightness of an oncoming upper beam
was many times that of an oncoming
lower beam. Likewise troublesome was the
variation in brightness caused by the de-
terioration in non-sealed beam lamps.
Even so, promise of real improvement in
glare was so obvious that the idea of
automatic headlamp control could not be
ignored.
At the start, the problem was to de-
velop something that was sensitive enough
to dim for lower beams at a safe distance.
Satisfactory sensitivity was achieved by
using a multiplier phototube which is
capable of about one million times the
sensitivity of standard vacuum phototubes.
As sensitivity was increased it was found
that extreme variations in brightness of
oncoming headlamps was not nearly as
serious as anticipated because very few
roads are straight and level for any great
distance. Increasing sensitivity, however,
uncovered other problems in the fields of
electricity and optics which had to be
solved in designing a satisfactory device.
Design of the Control
The production design of the Guide
Autronic-Eye headlamp control did meet
all of the required specifications. How the
various requirements were met can be
understood after a consideration of the
circuit diagram for the equipment.
Energy is provided by the car electrical
system through the standard light switch.
The voltage is applied to the ballast
tube, to the primary winding of the trans-
former, and then through a vibrator to
the ground.
The transformer has two secondary
windings, one producing approximately
1,150 volts a-c and the other approximate-
ly 150 volts a-c. The higher voltage is
rectified to produce approximately 1,000
volts d-c across a load resistor network.
A high voltage control is adjusted to sup-
ply the necessary voltage for the photo-
tube unit.' A sensitivity control in the
phototube unit adjusts the high voltage
to compensate for variations in photo-
tubes. The voltage is applied to the vari-
ous dynodes in the phototube through i
voltage divider network.
The 150-volt secondary winding of the
transformer supplies power for the ampli-
fier tube and the sensitive relay. In the
absence of light on the phototube, the
amplifier tube passes enough current
through the sensitive relay to close it. The
presence of light causes the phototube to
pass a current through a load resistance
which develops a negative bias voltage on
the amplifier tube control grid. This
causes the amplifier tube to reduce the
current through the sensitive relay. When
the current is reduced sufficiently, tht
sensitive relay opens. When the sensitive
relay opens, it switches a much larger
load resistance into the phototube circuit
and in this way causes the device to be
about ten times as sensitive in the lower
beam position as it is in the upper beam
position.
When the standard foot dimmer switch
is in the automatic position, the sensitive
relay opens and closes the power relay
which switches the headlamps between
the upper and lower beams.
When the push-button type auxiliary
foot switch is depressed it closes the sen-

sitive relay through an added section in
the amplifier tube, and overrides the auto-
matic control to provide the upper beam
even when bright light is on the photo-
tube.
When the standard foot dimmer switch
is depressed and released as in changing
from upper to lower beam, the power
relay is closed directly from the light
switch and holds the headlamps on the
lower beam regardless of the position of
the sensitive relay.
The optical design of the phototube
unit is shown in an accompanying photo.
A condensing lens focuses light through
an amber filter and through an opening
in a mask to a multiplier phototube. The
condensing lens is corrected for spherical
aberration and focuses the light from ap-
proaching headlamps to a point in the
plane of the mask. The vertical and hori-
zontal angles through which the device
responds to light are limited by the size
of the opening in the mask, and the sen-
sitivity cuts off abruptly when the point
of focused light passes the edge of the
mask opening.
An S4 (blue sensitive) cathode surface
is used in the multiplier phototube be-
cause red sensitive surfaces are not com-
patible with the materials used in the
amplifying sections. However, the high
sensitivity of the multiplier phototube
permits the use of an amber filter which
absorbs blue light and moves the effective
response toward the red end of the
spectrum.
A series of color sensitivity and emis-
sion curves of the S4 cathode surface, the
amber filter, an incandescent bulb, sky-
light, and the S4 surface through the am-
ber filter show that the relative emission
of skylight is much better than from an
incandescent bulb near the violet end
of the spectrum while the incandescent
bulb is better near the red end. The
curves also show that the amber filter
blocks off the light near the violet end
and thus reduces skylight much more
than incandescent light. The amber filter
permits the device to function sooner at
dusk by reducing the effect of skylight.
Performance Criteria
Some of the performance requirements
of an automatic headlamp control have
already been mentioned. The Autronic-
Eye control met these and other criteria by
means of the circuit described above. The
design problem was to insure that in the
achievement of one specification others
were not made impossible.
Switching to and Holding Lower Beam
The basic requirement is that the device
switch to the lower beam promptly when
subjected to sufficient light, and switch
back to the upper beam promptly when
light is removed. Rapid dimming is es-
pecially important in situations where an
approaching car comes suddenly in view,
as, for example over the crest of a hill.
The device must not only switch to dim,
but must hold in this condition when the
approaching car dims. If an approaching
car dims at some distance, the automatic
device must switch to and hold the dim
position until the oncoming car has
passed.
These basic requirements were designed
into the Autronic-Eye control by adjusting
sensitivity to dim at a certain optimum
sensitivity and then to hold the dim posi-
tion with about ten times as much sensi-
tivity. The multiplier phototube provides
the sensitivity for this technique, and, at
the same time, permits rapid operation in
both the dimming and upper beam re-
covery cycles.

High Speed Memory
Enlarged view of a section of a new
magnetic memory device developed by Dr.
Jan A. Rajchman, RCA physicist. Head
of a paper match (right) shows relative
size of the tiny magnetic cores that store
information of the kind used in electronic
computers. A core "memorizes" one bit
of information when both the horizontal
and vertical wires through its center
carry an electrical signal. The common
wire that threads through all the cores is
used to "read out" an electrical pulse that
may be created when an individual core
is interrogated. Insulated wires (dark
diagonals) link the common "read out"
wire of one group of cores to another.
The magnetic core memory was develop-
ed at the David Sarnoff Research Center
of RCA, Princeton, N.J., to provide a
high-speed and large-capacity memory
to help solve problems too vast and too
complex for present-day computers.
Nylon Spheres Collect Data
for Signal Corps
Ann Arbor—University of Michigan
engineers have developed a new and
simpler means for obtaining high alti-
tude data for the Army Signal Corps.
The new method involves dropping a
four-foot, 50-pound nylon sphere through
the atmosphere and measuring its rate of
fall by means of a miniature radar trans-
mitter mounted inside.
The sphere is carried in an Aerobee
rocket to a height of 75 miles, where it is
"kicked out" and inflated before begin-
ning its long fall back to earth. Precision
"tracking" of the miniature radar by
ground radar stations yields data on upper
air pressures, temperatures and winds.
It has been fired several times at White-
Sands Proving Ground, according to Les-
lie M. Jones, project supervisor and re-
search engineer for the U-M Engineering
Research Institute (ERI).
He reveals that independence of sur-
face weather conditions and of rocket
performance, except the altitude of the
rocket, are two of the biggest advantages
of the method. In addition, no recovery of
the recording equipment is required, since
all of the informatoin necessary is re-
corded from the radar signals bounced
back from the sphere.
The technique was devised by ERI en-
gineers under a contract with the Meteor-
ological Branch of the Army Signal
Corps. The research program was ini-
tiated in 1946 by Prof. Myron H. Nichols
of the U-M Aeronautical Engineering De-
partment, faculty supervisor of the group.
Nichols points out that the technique is
an important step in the development of a
reliable, inexpensive method with which
it is hoped eventually to make upper air
surveys at places other than White Sands.
Among other things, such surveys are es-
sential to the ultimate understanding of
the problem of world-wide air circulation
patterns.
The giant ball is hard, like a basketball,
and does not "float" downward in its fall.
It reaches a top supersonic speed of 2,000
miles per hour in about the middle of the
drop, according to Jones.
As it penetrates the denser atmosphere,
this speed decreases to a terminal velocity
of about 300 miles per hour. At about 12
miles up, the outside pressure becomes
greater than that of the sphere, and it
flutters to earth, collapsed—its mission
into the upper atmosphere completed.
ERI Studies "Human Factor"
in Aircraft Design
Ann Arbor—Faster-than-sound jet
planes have created a new emphasis on
the "human factor" in airplane designing,
a University of Michigan medical scientist
states.
The simple operation of the low-speed
planes of yesterday required only a man
to fit the machine, explains Dr. Wilfrid
T. Dempster, associate professor of anat-
omy in the Medical School, but the com-
plex controls of today's supersonic jets
make necessary a machine which fits the
man.
He points out that more must be known
about the movements of the human body
and their limitations, as an aspect of the
effort to improve man's over-all perform-
ance in the control of machines. One
problem is to provide engineers with a
"blue print" of possible hand and foot
movements, so that controls can be placed
at proper range for minimum effort and
maximum efficiency. Another is to chart
the variability of the location of human
hinge-points.
In the past, controls sometimes were
placed in the cockpit wherever space was

AND DEVELOPMENT
Call for Knowledge, Ingenuity, Teamwork
Making new products in large amounts, devising new proc-
esses, and improving old ones—such problems are the job of
Design and Development. An example was the development
of a large-scale process for making "Orion" acrylic fiber
starting from small laboratory samples of polyacrylonitrile.
Quantity production of polymer was only a beginning. A
whole set of new and unusual problems arose in spinning the
fiber, because polyacrylonitrile decomposes before it melts,
and it dissolves only in high-boiling solvents.
A team of Du Pont technical men—chemical and mechan-
ical engineers, instrumentation specialists, metallurgists, and
materials handling experts undertook to find a solution.
Here are a few of the problems they met:
1. Solve problems in heat transfer and fluid flow
arising from the fact that the spinning solution
must be blanketed with inert gas to prevent fire
hazards.
2. Design a system for controlling the tempera-
ture of the viscous spinning solution within ±0.5°F.
at hundreds of points in the plant.
3. Design new mechanisms for winding yarn at
high speed without any deviation in yarn tension.
4. Design air conditioning and ventilating sys-
tems to remove fumes from specific spots, but
still allow easy access to all areas.
Among Du Pont's many research and engineering activi-
ties, Design and Development jobs provide great oppor-
tunity for the knowledge, ingenuity, and teamwork capaci-
ties of men in a great variety of technical fields.

Here's a rather easy problem to start
off with. Two ferry boats leave from their
respective piers which are directly across
a river from one another. They pass each
other at a point 720 yards from one shore.
Each boat then docks for fifteen minutes
and then starts back toward its original
pier. On the return trip the two boats
pass each other at a point 400 yards from
the shore opposite to that referred to
above. Now we would like to know
just how wide is the river at the place
where the ferry boats run?
This one isn't too bad either. A man
rowing up stream at a constant speed in
the water noted a bottle floating in the
water opposite his boat just as he was
passing a pier. He continued rowing up-
stream for one half hour, then he turned
around and rowed downstream, still at
the same speed relative to the water. He
met the bottle again two miles down-
stream from the pier one hour later. What
is the speed of the rowboat?
A man drives from his home to a dis-
tant city—a distance of 100 miles. If he
drives the first fifty miles at 30 mph, and
the second at 50 mph, what is his average
speed? Don't jump to a hasty conclusion;
the answer isn't forty miles per hour.

he pawned for $15.00. Then he sold the

Smith got $30.00 for a $25.00 watch, the

$15.00, and J&amp;nes paid only $15.00 for a
ticket for a $25.00 watch. Who lost
money?
Although this one is rather obvious I
think it is worthwhile nevertheless. If
there are more trees in the world than
there are leaves on any one tree, prove
that there are at least two trees some-
where in the world which have the same
number of leaves.
Here's a rather amusing little problem.
A tramp steamer was sailing across the
Atlantic from Philadelphia to Liverpool.
Hanging from the stern was a rope lad-
der with twelve rungs. At the time in
question the steamer was still 950 miles
from Liverpool and was traveling at a
rate of fifteen miles per hour. If the
rungs of the ladder are thirteen inches
apart and the water is rising at the rate
of eleven inches per hour, how far from
Liverpool will the steamer be when the
water reaches the top of the ladder?
We were reminded by a recent news-
paper article of the farmer whose sons
were both very proud of their horses. The
farmer eventually got very tired of their
continual bragging. When he died, it was
discovered that he had made his will out
such that the son with the slower horse
would inherit all the property. Who had
the slower horse was to be decided by a
race to a nearby town and back. On the
way into town both sons rode their horses
just about as slowly as was possible. Upon
reaching town they stopped in at the
bar for a drink before starting back.
While there they told the bartender the
situation. He thought for several minutes
before whispering something in their ears.
Immediately both men rose, raced for the
horses, and galloped toward the farm at
top speed. We are wondering what it was
that the bartender told them.

CATHODE OF PHOTOTUBE
FILTER AND MASK
The optical design of a phototube unit.
Dimming on Curves
The device should dim for cars on
curves but should not dim excessively for
extraneous light at the roadside.
The desire for dimming on curves con-
flicts with the desire to restrain the device
from dimming for extraneous light at the
roadside. The first desire can be satisfied
by making the device responsive to light
at wide angles to the sides while the
second desire demands that the device
must not be sensitive to side light.
The Autronic-Eye control represents a
compromise between these two conditions,
designed to provide the narrowest pos-
sible sideways response angle consistent
with proper operation on curves.
Disregarding Road Reflection
The device should not be affected by
variations in the reflectivity of road sur-
faces, and the device must function with
normal variations of car loading.
Headlamps illuminate the road ahead
and the road brightness reflecting back
to the driver varies from almost nothing
on wet asphalt to a considerable amount
on dry gravel or fresh snow. A device
which is sensitive enough to retain the
lower beam after the approaching driver
dims is necessarily sensitive enough to
be greatly affected from road reflection,
unless the downward response angle is
carefully controlled. If too much light
from the road is permitted to reach the
phototube, the device will stay on the
lower beam. At the same time, the sensi-
tivity response angle must extend enough
below horizontal so that the device will
function properly under conditions of
normal car loading.
The Autronic-Eye control has a lens
and mask system which provides a sharp
lower cut-off. The cut-off is aimed as
low as possible without incurring inter-
ference from road reflection. This aim is
low enough to stand the upward tilting
caused by normal car loading without un-
due loss in sensitivity. The location of
the phototube unit on the car instrument
panel is shown in an accompanying dia-
gram.
Disregarding Weather
The device should function under con-
ditions of adverse weather such as rain,
snow, and fog.
The light from approaching cars is
somewhat diffused by rain on the wind-
shield but fortunately the device is not
affected appreciably in sensitivity. Ac-
tually, there seems to be an increase in
light from the approaching car, probably
due to reflections from wet pavement
adding to the normal direct light coming
from the lamps and this may balance out
any loss from light diffusion. In bad
weather drivers may devote full attention
to driving, without having to pay atten-
tion to their headlights. Very little sen-
sitivity is lost in moderate snow and fog.
If the snow or fog is severe, the back
reflection of the vehicle headlamps from
the snow or fog particles is sufficient to
retain the vehicle headlamps on the lower
beam.
City Driving and Following
The driver should be provided with a
means of obtaining a lower beam for use
in the city and when following another
car, when there is insufficient light to
retain the lower beam automatically.
The amber filter, mentioned above,
corrects, as much as possible, the rela-
tively poor red sensitivity of the multi-
plier phototube. With this combination,
the device retains the lower beam
satisfactorily when following a modem
car with relatively bright tail lights, but
it does not retain the lower beam at'a
sufficient distance for many older tail
lights, and it does not dim for any of
them. The Autronic-Eye control is con-
nected to the standard foot dimmer switch
so that it functions automatically in one
position only. The other position of the
foot dimmer switch provides a fixed
lower beam. When necessary, the driver
may use the foot dimmer switch to lock
the device on the lower beam. One of the
times when a continuous lower beam is
desirable is when following another
vehicle.
Using the Upper Beam
The driver should be provided with a
means of obtaining an upper beam for
signaling and at dusk, when there is too
much sky light for the device to switch
to the upper beam automatically.
After the automatic headlamp control
has dimmed, very little light is required
to retain the lower beam. There are occa-
sions, particularly at dusk when sky light
is still effective, when there is sufficient
light to retain the lower beam but not
enough to cause the device to dim. On
such occasions, the driver may prefer the
upper beam. This automatic headlamp
control includes a push-button auxiliary
foot switch to over-ride the automatic con-

trol and provide the upper beam regard-
less of light conditions. This switch resets
the sensitive relay to the upper beam posi-
tion, and when the foot switch is released
the device remains on the upper beam
unless there is sufficient light ahead for
dimming. Also, the overriding switch may
be used to signal approaching drivers if
they forget to dim.
Warming-Up Action
The device should provide the lower
beam during warm-up.
Most electronic devices require a mod-
erate warm-up time during which period
they do not provide automatic control.
Because vehicles usually are operated in
areas of opposing traffic during the warm-
up period, it is desirable to have a fixed
lower beam until the automatic control is
functioning. This period of no control,
therefore, must be considered in designing
an automatic control. The Autronic-Eye
control requires ten to 15 seconds warm-
up time for the rectifier and amplifier
tubes. The rectifier tube controls the high
voltage to the phototube, and the ampli-
fier tube provides the current to the sen-
sitive relay. The sensitive relay is in the
lower beam position when the amplifier
tube current is off. The rectifier tube is
adjusted to warm up ahead of the ampli-
fier tube so that the phototube is in con-
trol before the amplifier tube can operate
the sensitive relay to the upper beam
position.
Phototube unit mounted inside the car.
Operating in Daylight
The device should not be impaired
when operated in the daytime.
Most phototubes and particularly multi-
plier phototubes must be protected from
damage from bright light. A multiplier
(Continued from page 32)
phototube can easily destroy itself if it is
permitted to pass too much current. Occa-
sionally, a driver will operate his automatic
headlamp control during the daytime.
There are places for example through the
tunnels on the Pennsylvania Turnpike,
where a driver is requested to turn on his
headlamps in the daytime. It is common
to see cars travel a considerable distance
beyond the tunnel before their lights are
turned off. Since the device is connected
to be turned on with the headlamps, the
phototube is functioning during this
period.
The dynodes of the multiplier photo-
tube arc connected through individual
protective resistors so that the current
through each dynode is limited to a very
safe value. These protective resistors do
not affect the multiplier phototube func-
tion at night because the current values
are too small to cause detrimental voltage
changes to the dynodes.
Varying Battery Voltage
The device should be relatively insen-
sitive to changes in battery voltage.
Car batteries vary about 30 per cent in
voltage. Multiplier phototubes are very
sensitive to voltage changes; in fact, a
ten per cent increase in voltage doubles
the output. In order to obtain satisfactory
performance on a car, the Autronic-Eye
control is designed with voltage regula-
tion. Regulation is obtained by using a
current regulator (ballast tube) in the
primary of the transformer.
Conserving the Generator
The device should use a minimum of
current to avoid exceeding the generator
capacity.
Car generators are designed to keep
the batteries charged under given load
conditions and, ordinarily, they do not
accommodate very much extra load. For
this reason, the device is designed to use
a minimum of current. The 6-volt models
use 2.1 amperes in the upper beam posi-
tion and 2.5 amperes in the lower beam
position. The 12-volt models use 1.2 and
1.4 amperes in the upper and lower beam
positions, respectively.
Withstanding Motoring Hardships
The device should withstand the abuses
of automotive service, which include heat,
cold, vibration, moisture and dust.
Extensive field testing and tests on the
Belgian Block road at the General Motors
Proving Ground near Milford, Michigan,
indicate that special precautions were re-
quired to make the automatic headlamp
control rugged enough for automotive
service. Accordingly, the chassis was re-
inforced and condensers were anchored to
avoid wire breakage. Special lead con-
struction was used in the vibrators to
avoid internal wire breakage. High tem-
perature condensers were used because of
high engine heat on hot days. The ampli-
fier was enclosed to protect it from mois-
ture and dust: Special alloy points with
wiping contacts were used on the sensi-
tive relay to avoid tarnish. Special alloy
points were used on the power relay to
handle the headlamp load. Special ma-
terials were used in the phototube base to
avoid electrical leakage due to moisture.
The above photograph shows the general
location in the car of the principal units
of the Autronic-Eye control.
Experiences with the Autronic-Eye de-
vice indicate that extensive field testing
on cars is required to locate and correct
weaknesses in equipment of this nature.
Such testing is common in the automotive-
field.
Servicing Ease
Service facilities should be available
to adjust the device in the field.
An automatic headlamp control is basi-
cally a light measuring device. It dims
with a particular amount of light and
switches back to the upper beam with a
much smaller amount of light. The value
of light at each operating point, therefore,
is important and must be obtainable in
the field for service adjustments. Second-
ly, the phototube unit must be aimed
straight ahead and must be adjusted in the
vertical plane because of the significance
of the lower edge of the response angle.
Two pieces of test equipment were de-
veloped for servicing this automatic head-
lamp control: a test lamp for sensitivity
adjustments and an aiming device for
aiming the phototube unit. The test lamp
projects light against the phototube
cathode in about the same manner as
headlamps under operating conditions.
The brightness of the test lamp is ad-
justed to specific values by means of a
meter. One brightness is used to adjust
DIM sensitivity and a different brightness
is used in making hold sensitivity adjust-

MODERN FARMERS like J. A. Parks of Maloy, Iowa,
using the gang plow above, can produce much more in
much less time than the farmer of just a few years ago.
In the horse-powered days of farming it took as many
as 35 man-hours to produce and harvest an acre of
corn. Now, on many mechanized farms, it is done in
fewer than 11 man-hours. In addition, the shift from
animal power to machine power released about 72,000,-
000 acres of cropland from producing feed for horses
and mules to producing food for the nation's tables.
WHAT EVER HAPPENED
TO THE MAN BEHIND THE PLOW?
The "man behind the plow" is still very much
in the picture, but he's up front now. And because
he is, you and your family—even the world—are
better fed today.
Not many years ago the American farmer walked
behind the old horse-drawn plow, worked longer
hours and produced much less than he does today.
But that was before the development of the "hired
hands" that never tire—the tractors, trucks and
implements which do the work of many men, and
the petroleum fuels and lubricants which keep them
running.
In the last 50 years or so, while America's popu-
lation was growing from 75,000,000 to more than
150,000,000 a remarkable change was taking place
in agriculture. Today 8,000,000 fewer persons on
America's farms are producing food for 75,000,000
more Americans.
Yet America has never been better fed. It has
never been better equipped to export needed foods
to other countries for normal requirements, or to
combat famine—an ally of communism—wherever
it appears.
Never have so few fed so many so well.
To help make ours a more abundant land,
Standard Oil pioneered in delivering petroleum
products right to the farmers' doors in the quan-
tities needed and at reasonable prices. This on-
the-spot delivery, started way back in 1910, was
vital to the rapid growth of mechanized farming in
the Middlewest—one of the most productive agri-
cultural regions in the world.
So many rural customers have learned to de-
pend on Standard Oil products and services that
we now serve far more Midwestern farmers than
any other oil company.

merits. (The latter determines the point
where the device switches back to the up-
per beam.)
The aiming device is a mechanical fix-
ture which aims by means of a level,
when located on top of the phototube
unit. The fixture contains an aiming dial
which is adjusted to a code number stamp-
ed on a name plate underneath the photo-
tube unit. The code number permits ad-
justment of the level to compensate for
variations between the top surface of
the phototube unit and the lower edge
of the response angle. The code number
is stamped at the factory. The bottom
edge of the response angle is determined
in an optical fixture by means of test
lights after which a master level is placed
on the phototube unit to find the code
number. In this manner, an optical aim
of the response angle is converted at the
factory into a mechanical aim, and then
the mechanical aim is used for field
service.
Due to the high sensitivities required
in automatic headlamp control devices,
satisfactory operation is largely a matter
of proper adjustment. The importance of
adequate field service facilities, therefore,
cannot be over-emphasized.
Summary
Experience during the first year of
production demonstrates that, in comply-
ing with all of the above requirements,
the Autronic-Eye automatic headlamp
control offers real possibilities for improv-
ing the glare problem.
Public acceptance has been unusually
good, particularly since an owner's first
thought is that he is spending money for
a device which only benefits the other
fellow. He quickly learns, however, that
the device does even more for him than
for the approaching driver. He finds that
the device gives him an upper beam more
often than ever before in spite of the
fact that it always dims for approaching
cars.
By relieving the driver of the burden
of operating his headlamps, the Autronic-
Eye control makes night driving more
pleasant and safe.

SUCCESSFUL
DESIGNS
SIMPLY being able to create a
unique machine design is no
longer enough to insure a success-
ful career in product engineering.
Today, more than ever before, a
machine design must be strong
and durable, yet be the lowest in
cost, to be acceptable to company
management.
As a result, many new designs
are of welded steel construction
and existing designs are being
converted to eliminate excessive
material and to reduce the number
of shop manhours needed for
fabrication.

trial Equipment on his own time, and had
been following current articles along the
same line. Since he wished to locate in
sales engineering, he had listed a valuable
special interest in an up-to-the-minute
way.
9. Preferences. You may hesitate to
mention two or three or four preferences,
fearing that some employer may pass you
up if the opening he has does not quite
fit your desires. Indeed, the fear may be
justified. But you can hardly leave him
completely in the dark; he is quite likely
to do the same to you—which is fair
enough. He does not want to ask you to
come across the state for an interview,
only to find that you don't want his sales
job. On the positive side if he is looking
for a production man, and you have
said you wanted to be one, you begin
to get together with him right away.
Of course, preferences are to be stated
in general, functional terms. An older
man may properly say he wishes to
design fractional horsepower motors; that
is his line, and has been for years. You, a
recent graduate, will say that you want
design of small rotating apparatus. And
put down about three preferences, not
just one. It is seldom necessary to state
negatives. However, if you positively will
not consider something—such as sales—
say so.
10. References. It is customary to cite
as references one or more of the men you
have already worked for. They are used
to these matters and will take it as a mat-
ter of course. As a college man, such
references will not complete your list.
You must not fail to refer to at least one
faculty member. Otherwise, the employer
will assume that for some reason that
ought to be smoked out, you left college
under such a cloud that you would rather
not have your name brought up on the
campus any more than can be helped.
That isn't the case—but what is he to
think? No, you do not need to ask per-
mission of any faculty member in order
to refer to him. Whether or not you ask
him about it, he will be glad to respond
to inquiries, and he will tell the facts as
he sees them in either case. Now, there is
often good reason for asking him first;
you thus make more certain that he really
will remember you. It lessens the chance
that in a couple of years he will be mis-
taking you for the classmate of about the
same size, weight, and degree of diffi-
culty in keeping awake in that early after-
noon class.
11. (. . .?) Write your own ticket. It
is by no means intended that when ten
categories are listed above, you will faith-
fully have all ten—no more, no less.
Make the job your own. And after read-
ing, do not get in the wrong by trying to
bedevil some poor faculty member into
telling you in detail how to do it. Get
to work and design the record. Type it to
see how it will look. Then, if you wish,
take it to a faculty member and ask for
suggestions.
It is entirely legitimate to get all the
ideas you can from personal records al-
ready available. We have plenty on file in
the E.E. Department. The secretary will
be glad to let you look at several at your
leisure.
To close this matter of personal
records, a striking instance may be cited.
A recent graduate carefully informed
himself before he left the campus. He
shortly sent me one of the best records I
have ever seen. A few days later he called
on a certain firm in his home city and
handed a copy to the girl. She cheerfully
passed it on to the chief engineer and
promised that it would receive attention.
However, she told the graduate not to
wait. It was not customary to grant an
interview the same day. He chose to wait
anyway. In five minutes he was called in.
He answered three questions and in ten
more minutes was hired. Total elapsed
time, fifteen minutes. He's there yet.
In the spring of 1939, I made a study
of the content of interview and applica-
tion blanks of 21 companies. I have not
seen such a study published anywhere;
this is a republication of that study.
Forty-two items were found that are of
significance in the placement of college
seniors. Omitted are some items that ap-
ply mainly to older men—such as Number
of Children.
The table presents (at top) the confi-
dential key numbers of 21 companies,
and (at left) the 42 items. A blank space
means that the company did not include
that item. It is amusing to note that one
of the largest firms in the world forgot to
ask for height and weight.
Companies 1-3 are automotive; 4-11,
chemical; 12-13, electrical; 14-17, me-
chanical; 18-19, steel; and 20-21, optical

\I»MIIIK THE FOUNTAIN PEN, and ponder—how is
it that it's priced low enough for universal ownership, yet of
superior quality to the expensive product of just a few years
back? Answer: precision production, ably abetted by the "man-

carborundum.* Today, barrels are finished and polished by
abrasive belts or grinding wheels. Points are slitted by paper-
thin abrasive wheels. Clips are finished by barrel tumbling
with abrasive grain, carborundum alone supplies all types
of abrasives; quite naturally, many leading manufacturers, in
all lines, have established carborundum as their one, depend-
able, controlled-quality source of supply.

best available without regard to the hu-
man factor, he states.
To meet this challenge, Dr. Dempster
has denned the work space for a variety
of hand and foot positions of a group of
young men of selected body types.
He calls each work space based on a
given hand or foot orientation a "kineto-
tope," which literally means "place of
movement."
Use of the kinetotopes is not limited
to the design of airplane cockpits, he in-
dicates. It also can have far-reaching ap-
plications in the operation of machinery
in industry.
By regarding the human body as a
geometrical figure with restricted areas of
maximum movement, Dr. Dempster
places an engineering interpretation on
the body and its parts.
The pilot thus becomes a combination
of levers, joints, pivots and hinges to
which the cockpit space can be adapted,
he asserts, adding that this work will help
flesh-and-bone machines to fit into the
cockpit of tomorrow and operate with the
maximum smoothness and ease.
The research, being done by the U-M
Engineering Research Institute under
sponsorship of the U. S. Air Force, is aim-
ed at producing a practical design manni-
kin with accurate movements for use in
laying out cockpits and other work spaces
in future aircraft.

thieves at work.
The locale was a stockroom of an RCA
television service branch in Hollywood.
Inventories had disclosed that television
equipment was being stolen on a sub-
stantial scale—some $38,000 worth (cov-
ered by insurance) was missing on the
initial check.
Officials on the spot, recalling the suc-
cess of RCA industrial television equip-
ment in functioning as an "eye" in loca-
tions too dangerous or inconvenient for
human observers, decided to try the de-
vice as an electronic witness to the crime.
Summoning the police, they concealed the
camera unit among the rafters of the
stockroom with the lens focusing on the
loading platform. The rest of the unit—
the TV receiver and viewing screen—was
placed in a second-floor room some dis-
tance away.
Every day for two weeks, the TV
"eye" was trained on the loading platform
as police watched at the receiver. The
camera recorded the routine activities at
the platform—but it also recorded the
suspicious actions of one clerk, who cas-
ually placed a number of TV tubes on
the loading platform during the lunch
hour on Tuesdays and Thursdays when
few other people were around. At ap-
parently pre-arranged intervals, a pick-up
truck would back into the driveway, the
boxes would be put aboard with the help
of the suspect, and the truck would pull
away—all before the gaze of the camera
and the interested watchers at the TV
screen.
Once the facts had been made dear
by the TV unit, the trap was set. The
police at the receiver waited until the
truck took off with another load of tubes.
As they moved in to arrest the clerk, a
police car trailed the truck to its destina-
tion and seized the driver and two alleged
confederates.
The hero of the story is an industrial
TV unit which already has been put to
scores of uses—patrolling, guarding,
transmitting fingerprints and signatures,
checking numbers of freight cars, super-
vising operations of machinery at a dis-
tance, riding rockets, and generally fitting
itself handily into locations where direct
view is required and the human eye can-
not go.
Its efficiency in these operations, and in
its newly-acquired detective role, stems
from the compactness of the camera and
the fidelity with which it transmits what
it sees. The RCA Vidicon tube, heart of
the system, is only six inches long and an
inch in diameter. The camera that is built

The unit is completed by a connecting cable and a compact

can be attached to the monitor if required, and the controls
allow the camera focus to be controlled from the receiving end.
Although TV in this compact form has been available to
industry for less than ten years and has been developed by
RCA engineers into its present state within the past two years,
it has already carved a vital role for itself in a wide variety of
jobs. Its recent performance in Hollywood was a new depar-
ture, however, and its success as a witness to the crime prom-
ises to open a broad field for TV as an electronic arm of the

Analog Computers to Test Suspension System
Ann Arbor—The automobile you buy in a few years may
have improved springs and give a smoother ride if manufac-
turers use mathematical calculation instead of actual experi-
ments to test proposed suspension systems.
Robert D. Jeska, research associate in the Willow Run Re-
search Center of the Engineering Research Institute at the
University of Michigan, found this out when he and other
engineers conducted tests for the Detroit Tank Arsenal in a
study of vehicle suspension systems.
The researchers found that an electronic brain, called an
analog computer, could predict the exact motion and speed
of an automobile when it was driven over a certain road. They
checked the machine calculations by comparison with actual
field tests of an automobile driven over the same road. Both
tests gave essentially the same results: the difference was no
greater than the probable error of the field test measurements.
This comparison verified the scientific principle that results
from machine simulation are equal to results obtained in actual
experiment. Although this principle has been fundamental to
previous research, this is one of the few times it has been
checked.
So, in the future designers can use machine calculations to
weigh the effect of many and minute changes in the construc-
tion of suspension systems. This is easier and cheaper than
actual experimentation and more accurate, because the effects
of noise can be separated from the effects being measured.
New Douglas DC-7
Preliminary flight tests of the Douglas DC-7 indicate that
the new airliner will exceed many of its original performance
specifications.
With more than two-thirds of the CAA certification testing
completed, W. H. P. Drummond, the company's chief test
engineer, said today that the DC-7 "will do everything we in-
tended it to do—and more."
The American public will get its first look at the trans-
port late in November when it goes into non-stop coast-to-coast
service for American Airlines. Other airplines awaiting deliv-
ery of the DC-7 are United, Delta-C &amp; S, National and

some of the thermocouples than to others.
The maximum horizontal temperature
difference between rooms was 1.6°F for
an outdoor temperature of 32°F and
2.5°F for an outdoor temperature of 0°F
when all levels of observation were con-
sidered in computing the average. The
greatest variations between rooms usually
occurred at levels 2 inches and 60 inches
above the floor. Insulating the walls and
adding storm windows did not significant-
ly change the horizontal temperature
variations within rooms and between
rooms.
The heat loss of the Test Bungalow
was 8.33 KW at an outdoor temperature
of 0°F when the walls were uninsulated
and 5.18 KW when the walls were insu-
lated. Because the line voltage was only
208 volts, the ten panels installed in the
Test Bungalow consumed only 8.2 KW
of electric power; and since the installed
capacity did not exactly equal the heat
loss on a room-by-room basis, some of the
rooms of the uninsulated house were
slightly underheated at an outside tem-
perature of 0°F. The relation between
(Continued from page 11)
heat loss and indoor-outdoor temperature
difference was linear. The ratio of the
heat loss of the insulated structure to that
of the uninsulated structure was 62 per-
cent for an outdoor temperature of 0°F
and 66 percent for an outdoor tempera-
ture of 32°F.
An attempt was made to heat the insu-
lated house with six panels at an outdoor
temperature of 0°F using two panels in
the living room and one each in the other
four smaller rooms. Some of the rooms
were found to be underheated because the
heat loss of a particular room exceeded
the installed capacity of that room. The
results indicated the desirability of having
heating units of lower and intermediate
wattage capacity to heat small rooms.
The radiant panels in the uninsulated
bungalow were under identical condi-
tions with a forced warm-air heating sys-
tem using baseboard registers whose vanes
directed the warm air down at the floor.
Comparison showed the radiant system
provided more radiant energy at the 30-
inch level and more comfort at the floor
level.
The first submarine installation of a pipe-type
CQDIB SySrein was recently installed under the Hudson River
at Poughkeepsie, N.Y Three cables, each nearly %-miles long,
were simultaneously pulled into a six-inch welded steel pipe laid
across the river bottom. The pipe was then filled with oil main-
tained at 200 lbs. pressure, enabling a 110,000-volt power circuit
to cross the river safely.
This kind of system is called Oilostatic— a design which has long
been first choice among utilities for handling large blocks of power
by means of a high-pressure pipe-type cable system. Increased cir-
cuit reliability and savings on installation and maintenance costs
are realized.
Oilostatic's new role as a submarine cable is typical of the sig-
nificant contributions to better electrical service made by Okonite
engineers. • • •

cal cable... and installations on such

The effect of lowering and raising the
thermostat setting was studied for both
temperature pickup and power demands.
From the data accumulated it appears that
in the insulated house, utilizing all ten
panels, one hour is required to raise the
room temperatures from 65° to 70°F at
an outside temperature of 0°F.
Analysis of the tests indicated that com-
pensated room thermostats with very low
differential which produce rapid cycling
of the heating units are desirable with
radiant glass heating panels. This would
provide a continuous emission of radiant
heat, since the cessation of radiation be-
tween heating cycles was quite noticeable
when the "off" period was of long dura-
tion. Also a control device for the sys-
tem which would permit heating of the
house to a comfortable level at design
outdoor temperature, but which would
limit the electric power demand to a value
approximately equivalent to the design
heat loss rate, is desirable both from the
standpoint of the consumer and the utility
company.
One type of glass panel was subjected
to thermal shock tests of the type that
might occur in use, such as rain coming
through a window or shower spray in the
bathroom. The main effect of the treat-
ment was an increase in power demanded
by the panel due to the water's cooling
action. Mechanical shock tests showed
that the principal weakness was in re-
sistance to shock around the edges.
The results of these tests indicate that
electrically heated radiant glass panels
constitute a satisfactory method of warm-
ing a well insulated basementless house
from the standpoint of temperature gra-
dients in the vertical and horizontal direc-
tions, floor temperatures, and general
comfort. Accepted methods for the calcu-
lation of the heat loss of a house may be
used in determining the total capacity of
the heating units required. The total
energy required to produce a desired con-
dition of warmth may be slightly less with
electric panels than with more conven-
tional heating units because_of the ab-
sence of piping or duct heat losses, be-
cause the reverse heat losses from the
heating elements are lower, and because
the individual room thermostats can more
readily prevent overheating of any of the
rooms.

Early service with the world's fastest

result of the accelerated testing program
conducted by Douglas. The company, for
the first time in history, is using three air-
craft instead of the usual single prototype
for CAA certification tests.
Already completed are power plant de-
velopment tests, landing and take-off per-
formance, propeller vibration, flight
characteristic and dive brake tests.
Company pilots and test engineers are
currently determining the DC-7's climb
performance, stall speed, and checking
out sound level, air conditioning and
cockpit emergency procedures.
Douglas has completed approximately
200 hours of flight testing of the "Seven."
Another 50 to 100 hours remain before
the overall testing program is completed.
Londelius said it would take several
weeks to interpret recorded data from
many of the tests.
"It is the general opinion of the pilots
that the DC-7 has even more potential
than was anticipated," the testing coordi-
nator declared.

announced at a recent symposium on space
travel. It would cost about $250,000 to set
up an earth-to-moon and back communi-
cation system.
A meeting, attended by topflight scient-
ists, rocket manufacturers, and electronic
company executives, was held recently in
New York for the purpose of discussing
the possibilities of future space travel. A
majority of the scientists agreed that an
artificial moon could be built 1,075 miles
away from the earth's surface. Some of
them believed that with such a space
planet as an advanced base rocket flights
to the moon would be possible. Accord-
ing to Dr. Wernher von Braun, director
of a rocket research center, industrial re-
rearch has reached the point where such
a man-made moon will be established
within 10 years.

The above photograph shows the new Great Lakes self-unloader taking on her
first cargo of crushed limestone at Calcite, Michigan. The Department of Naval
Architecture was directly concerned with the design and construction of the
JOHN G. MUNSON, which is the largest self-unloader in the world. Students
were constantly in touch with the details of construction and design problems
and were guests at the launching. The vessel is 600 feet long, has a beam of
72 feet, a depth of 36 feet, and draws 25 feet of water with a capacity of over
22,000 tons of cargo. Powered with a 7000 horsepower turbine the vessel
makes a speed of about 17 MPH loaded and 19 MPH light. A similar vessel is
now in the preliminary design stage with a cargo capacity of over 30,000 tons
of stone at an even higher speed.

Academic Freedom
Academic freedom in the United States is the
foundation of our liberty. It is through academic
freedom that the minds of the American people
who have been trained and aroused to question,
to investigate, and to express dissenting
opinions. To abrogate one iota of this freedom
is to deprive Americans of their birthright.
Academic freedom, however, can and has
been abused in this country. Investigations by
the government have revealed educators whose
prime interest is not freedom but the use of aca-
demic freedom as a device to cloak the under-
mining of our liberty. They have betrayed the
trust vested in them to aid our enemies.
Consider the position of an educator in any
level of teaching—grade school, high school, or
college. American students are his clay; he has
the power to form their opinions and their be-
liefs. If he chooses to misuse this power, students
are defenseless. They are not usually in a posi-
tion to question the validity of the instructor's
statements. They must accept his words, since
they do not, in most cases, have the background
knowledge to dispute them.
To maintain, then, the academic freedom
which Americans hold so dear, those few educa-
tors who would indoctrinate students with prin-
ciples alien to those of their country must be
branded. How may this best be done?
Many well-meaning Americans have level-
ed harsh criticism at Congressional investigat-
ing committees. Some criticism may well be
justified. Investigators are not infallible. Less
publicity would assist the innocent teacher to
maintain his reputation. The assumption that
"a man is innocent until proven guilty" seems
sometimes to have been forgotten. On the other
hand, what are investigators to believe when
questionable educators hide behind the Fifth
Ameendment? As one critic of the investigations
once gave an analogy: A completely impartial
deep-sea diver, upon being blinded by a cloud of
ink, would not immediately assume that he was
in the presence of an octopus, but he would
know that he was in the presence of something
which did not wish to be seen.
This is the predicament of Congressional in-
vestigators. Those who adhere to Communist
doctrines have no compunctions about using any
posible methods to conceal themselves. In the
interest of preserving American liberty, includ-
ing academic freedom, investigators have no
choice but to label these educators as "ques-
tionable." If a teacher is loyal to the United
States, why should he not declare his loyalty?
If he is loyal, how could answering the questions
of the invesitgators "incriminate" him?
Communist infiltration of American schools
has been proved. It would be deadly folly for the
American people to deny it. It would be even
deadlier folly for them to allow the scholar's
cap and gown to provide immunity to those who
would strip education of its freedom.
American students have a right to know all
sides of any question. This is the basic tenet of
academic freedom. But they also have a right to
know what is fact and what is opinion and to
know in what doctrine the opinion is rooted. If
Communists are to be allowed to teach, brand
them, at least, for what they are. For the pres-
ervation of academic freedom and of unpois-
oned minds, disloyal educators must be revealed.

Here you see two pieces of steel.
They are the same size, the same
shape, the same weight. Although
they look exactly alike, one of
these steels is far more valuable—
in terms of what it can do.
It's the piece on the right—one
of the US S High Strength Steels
—and it has greater strength than
the ordinary carbon steel shown
on the left. This means that with
USS High Strength Steel you
can reduce the weight of a rail-
road car, a truck, a bus, or of
many other steel products . . .
without reducing their strength.
USS High Strength Steel in a
},\" thickness can frequently be
substituted in a design which uses
*/%' ordinary carbon steel, without
sacrificing strength in the equip-
ment.
Or—you can work it this way.
Simply use USS High Strength
Steel in the same thickness as
ordinary carbon steel. Then,
equipment will be stronger and
more rugged . . . but it will weigh
no more!
Furthermore, one of these high
strength steels—USS Cor-Ten
—has high resistance to atmos-
pheric corrosion—4 to 6 times
that of plain steel. Think what
this means in increased life!
Very fine, you say, but what
will all this cost? Well, here's the
real pay-off. Surprisingly enough
the products improved with USS
High Strength Steels usually cost
no more . . . because pound for
pound the steel does more. Its
slightly higher initial cost per
pound is often offset by the fact
that less steel is needed. And, in
the long run, many products made
from these better steels actually
cost less because they last longer,
and are cheaper to operate and
maintain.
Developing special steels for special customer needs is an important job of United States Steel metallurgists and
engineers. With their tremendous background of practical experience, they are ready to work on any problem that
involves the more efficient use of steel. United States Steel Corporation, 525 William Penn Place, Pittsburgh 30, Pa.

• Three Tri-State College Engi-
neering graduates are playing an
important part in the construction
of a new, modern jet test facility at
Allison Division of General Motors
Corporation.
William R. Johnson, right, re-
ceived his B.S. degree in Mechani-
cal Engineering in 1941 . . . the
same year he joined Allison as a
junior test engineer. In 1952, after
several promotions and a period in
military Service, he became an engi-
neering supervisor and was as-
signed the responsibility of engi-
neering the eight jet engine test
cells at the new experimental plant.
The new test cells—revolutionary
in design—make use of huge 100-
ton steel tanks calculated to with-
stand an ultimate internal pressure
of 175 PSIG.
11. F. Prang, left, was graduated
in '42 with a B.S. in Mechanical
Engineering. Later, he joined Alli-
son as a draftsman in connection
with the development of sleeve type
bearings for aircraft engines. From
the beginning of the new test plant
program, he has been supervisor
of drafting in the "Experimental Jet
Facilities Group" which provides
all designs of test equipment in the
building.
Edward G. Delaney, center, re-
ceived his B.S. in Mechanical Engi-
neering in 1951. He was recently
promoted to the "Test Projects Con-
trol Group" at Allison. His job will
be to use the new equipment and
facilities in the testing of jet en-
gines. He will be running individual
tests on components, and coordi-
nating proper control installations
on experimental engines.
Allison's.long range engineer-
ing program is expanding, offering
unlimited opportunities to young
graduate engineers. We think you,
too, will like it at Allison, the only
manufacturer whose jet engines have
accumulated more than 3,000,000
hours in the air!

as YOUR future is concerned
skv*be the limit
Never has the future been so inviting
for young engineers as that awaiting
them today in the field of aeronautics.
And never have the opportunities been so
promising as those offered at Goodyear
Aircraft Corporation.
The reasons for this are twofold.
VERSA TILITY is the keynote at Goodyear
Aircraft, offering you the widest latitude
for your engineering talents. Here is tak-
ing place pioneer research and develop-
ment of guided missiles, bonded sandwich
structures, plastics for radomes and cock-
pit canopies, metals and metal-working
techniques for the production of fuselage
shells, fuel tanks, wheels and brakes and
countless airplane components.
Goodyear is America's only producer of
both heavier- and lighter-than-air craft.
STABILITY is a priceless advantage of
working with Goodyear, for it is a leader
in one of America's basic industries —a
place that will always be doing business
come defense, peace or war.
Put the two together and you have oppor-
tunities unlimited and a future assured.
WE INVITE YOU TO WRITE for our
booklet "Plan Your Career At Goodyear

DR. CARL G. HOLSCHUH
Dr. Carl G. Holschuh, author of "What
Industry Expects from Technical Colleges
and Universities," is Vice President and
Assistant General Manager of the Sperry
Gyroscope Co., Division of the Sperry
Corporation. He joined the Company in
1933 as an engineering drawing tracer,
after graduating from Rutgers University
in 1931 with the B.S.C.E. degree and then
taking graduate work in engineering and
business administration. While at the Uni-
versity he became a member of Tau Beta
Pi and in 1950 Rutgers conferred upon him
the honorary degree of Doctor of Engi-
neering.
During the ten years after he joined
Sperry Dr. Holschuh received several pro-
motions, becoming a cam designer in
1937, head of the Fire Control Engineering
Department in 1942 and later chief re-
search director. He became vice president
and works manager in 1949 and was ap-
pointed to his present position in 1952.
His laboratory work on airborne gun-
sights and turrets resulted in five patents.
During World War II Dr. Holschuh was
appointed to the National Defense Re-
search Council. Societies of which he is a
member include the Institute of the Aero-
nautical Sciences and the American Ord-
nance Association.
Introduction
Today management members of indus-
try spend a great deal of their time and
that of their organizations in studying
what employees want and expect from in-
dustry. It is also important that those of
us in industry make clear to educators of
technical students what we look for in
employees we would like to have in our
organizations.
Since my views are based primarily on
my own experiences, it is in order to give
the reader a brief picture of the Sperry
Gyroscope Company, where, except for a
short time, I have been employed since I
left college. We are a Company of ap-
proximately 16,000 people, located in
Great Neck, New York, and are one of
the larger of 17 Divisions and Subsidiaries
of the Sperry Corporation. While we are
associated in the public's mind as a com-
pany that manufacturers gyroscopes, our
research and development have led us into
many other fields, so that at the present
time we manufacture aircraft instruments
and automatic pilots, aviation, naval and
ground ordnance, bombing and naviga-
tion systems, radio and radar equipment,
microwave systems, and guided missiles.
The principal distinguishing feature of our
products is that they are very complex in
function, and as they are designed to meet
very exacting requirements, are built for
the most part to extremely fine tolerances.
Their development and manufacture re-
quire a correspondingly complex organi-
zation of men and women with many
types of skills and technical training.
Value of Technical Education
We look to our college and universities
for the personnel with the proper scien-
tific training to carry on our research and
engineering work. Without going into the
detailed subject of technical training I
would like to state that we hope our edu-
cators will continue to keep up with the
scientific advances made in university and
industrial laboratories. If this knowledge
is passed on to students, we will have
available well-trained, competent techni-
cal personnel who know the facts of their
chosen profession. I would like to dispose
of this technical phase of our require-
ments with the statement that I feel the
American colleges and universities are
doing an excellent job in providing us
with well-trained personnel, except for
one thing: they are not giving us enough
of them. There is no doubt that in the
United States, for many years to come,
there will remain a tremendous shortage
of technical personnel, and it is necessary
for all of us to do whatever we can to
make up this shortage.
I think it is imperative that colleges
and universities follow a two-pronged
program:
(a) do whatever is possible to get
more students enrolled in engineering
and other technical courses, and
(b) point out to their students the
advantages of continuing in the engineer-
ing professions.
The program of developing an adequate
technical working force for the nation is
an important one. If educators place
strong emphasis on the value of technical
training we, as a nation, can fill the pres-
ent shortage as quickly as possible for
the benefit of all of us.
Aside from the technical phases of the
student's training, there is, I feel, another
side which requires more attention. This
side, along with the shortage of technical
personnel, is of very great concern to us
today. I think I can safely make the
statement that in industry the chief
obstacles to the success of a prospect, or
the development and manufacture of a
particular product, are of a personal and
administrative, rather than a technical na-
ture. Conversely, the success of an indi-
vidual engineer can be greatly increased
if he possesses both appreciation for and
capability to deal with the non-technical
problems in his work.
Putting Education to Work
Let us examine broadly how our Com-
pany, or any manufacturing company,
handles the development and production
of a product. In the beginning a re-
quirement is recognized. This require-
ment may originate within our own or-
ganization or with one of our customers.
If careful study of the requirements and
a general outline of the specifications indi-
cate that the expenditure of money on a
research project might lead to a satis-
factory product, the project is assigned to
a group of research engineers which acts
as a team, working within specified limits
of time and money. If their efforts are
successful, a group of specially qualified
product engineers are brought into the
team to prepare the product for produc-
tion and to aid it through manufacture.
The product engineer's responsibility is to
produce a finished design with all the
necessary engineering information and
specifications from which factory person-
nel can work in order to manufacture the
product efficiently. Upon the completion
of this engineering information in a form
suitable for manufacturing purposes, an-
other group, the works engineers, comes
into the position of prime responsibility
of solving problems that arise during the
production phase of the program.
It is necessary to point out that the re-
search engineer, when he has the primary
responsibility, will consult and take ad-
vice from the product engineer and works
engineer, and that each group in turn acts
in an advisory capacity when it is not
handling the prime responsibility.
Finally the product is assembled and
shipped to the customer, and then another
group of engineers, called field service
engineers, take over the responsibility of
installation and service of the product in
use. Because of the highly technical nature
of our products, we have over 700 service

BY
A. D. MOORE, Professor of Electrical Engineering
Way back in 1935 the Technic printed
a couple of articles by Professor A. D.
Moore on job-hunting. At the time these
articles were written, during the dark days
of Depression, jobs were considerably more
scarce than they are today and the grad-
uating engineer was faced with an em-
ployment problem that is difficult to ap-
preciate in these fat days (for Engineers)
of engineer scarcity.
However, notwithstanding the larger
numbers of offers now available, the grad-
uating engineer should still give consid-
erable thought to his choice of employer.
With this in mind, last month we printed
Professor Moore's article "Dear Sir:" on
how to apply for a job interview; this month
we give you "Good Morning, Sir" or how
to get the job after you've got the inter-
view. __^^^
Some interviews are easy to obtain. An
employer's representative comes to the
campus, you sign up for an interview,
and that's that. At the other end of the
scale is an interview you seek, and which
takes place in the employer's office. Let's
talk about that kind. Assume that the
employer has written to me asking for
candidates. I dip into my file of available
men and select four names. Maybe I
really found six who might qualify, but
only four have complied with the well-
published request for filing personal rec-
ords; two others have not, and are often
passed by for that reason. Why? If a man
will not go to a small amount of trouble
to participate in a plan erected entirely
for his own benefit, how can I believe
he will take care of an employer's inter-
ests in any better style?
Next, having the typed records at hand,
I can make sure the four are qualified,
with no loss of time. Duplicate letters
are now sent to the men, apprising them
of the opening, and giving the essential
facts of the case. At the same time I write
to the employer and at least tell him the
names of the men he may expect to hear
from. If I have time—and often I don't—
and if the occasian may warrant, I may
also discuss each man in the letter to the
employer.
It is now up to each man to telephone
the employer for an interview date or to
write a request for that privilege. If the
request is by letter, the candidate includes
a copy of his personal record.
Assuming you are granted an interview,
you get there ahead of time. In the next
twenty minutes you decide your fate. I
assume you have already learned (forgive
A. D. Moore
these personal details) that pants look
better when pressed; that a recent shave
improves any male of college age or over;
that finger nails need cleaning as well as
cutting; that there is at least once when
it is well to sit up straight and favor the
other fellow with a few direct looks—
which is right now. The employer has
usually had some practice at interviewing,
and he will probably lead the conversa-
tion. To any questions give direct and
clear replies. If he dangles an opportun-
ity for you to run off at length on some
tangent, be wary. Perhaps he is looking
for that very trait. You came here about
this job, not to issue a half-hour alibi
for the football team. Of course, if it
appears that he really wants to take time
out to discuss football, skeet shooting, or
the soybean crisis, let him have his way
and even contribute to the sin. But be
careful.
Don't ever make the mistake of assum-
ing that all employers are interview ex-
perts. Some certainly must find interview-
ing quite a trial. When the poor man
seems hesitant about prying into your
qualifications he may need help. Take the
lead and tell your story to the best of your
ability—keeping your twenty minutes in
mind. He is a busy man, but kindly and
courteous. He may make it easy for you
to overstay, but will take sharp and secret
objection to any serious transgression. If
you err on the safe side by attempting to
leave too soon, he will hold you; don't
worry about that. If he keeps you all
morning and then takes you out to lunch-
eon, it is a safe assumption that matters
are going rather well. But look out for
luncheons. It will then be too late for
anything but regrets if you do not al-
ready know how to handle yourself at the
table. This does not finish our discussion
of interviews; we will have to come back
to it later on.
How You Can Fit In
You are about to graduate; it is cus-
tomary for graduates to secure employ-
ment and make a living; therefore, you
propose to follow custom. Well, no grad-
uate is ever handed a job on that basis.
The cold, hard world doesn't care a
whoop whether you, individually, get a
job or not. The only reason you will ever
be hired is because you have convinced
some employer that it will pay to take you
on. Now, it is true that a few large com-
panies recruit a large group of men each
year, the only immediate concern being
that each man be desirable. That is cam-
pus recruiting; you can learn of it here,
first-hand. It is quite a different story
when you approach an employer who has
no jobs open.
You make such an approach because
this is one company you would like to be
with. You secure an interview. The em-
ployer is glad to look you over, at least.
Now get this picture: that morning he,
the chief engineer, has had a dozen tele-
phone calls, a third of which call for
decisions. His patent expert was in a
while ago to raise a question he will have
to settle, and he doesn't know the answer.
Shortly before you arrive, a report is
dumped on his desk, calling for a close
decision as to whether to spend fifty
thousand for scrapping old machinery and
buying new. His wife is on the telephone,
asking him to help guess whether little
Philbert's temperature is due to scarlet
fever, indigestion, or cussedness inherited
from the father's side. And then you walk
in. He didn't ask for you in the first
place. He cannot use you now. Unaided,
he can't see where he might use you six
months hence. If you simply appear as a
large blushing graduate who wants to
work for him, all you are doing is to hand
him one more vexing problem he can't
find the answer to. Did you just remark
that such a chief engineer's morning is
12
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


right; many of his mornings are easier to
get through than this one.
Doesn't it become rather clear that
under such circumstances, you had better
come prepared to help him solve your
problem? It is possible for you to come
to the interview knowing a great deal
about the company's products; advertise-
ments, trade journal articles, gossip,
friends—there are many possible leads.
You learn that certain products have not
switched over to welding—which is one
of your preferential interests. You are
prepared to suggest that you might be
taken on in any capacity whatever, just so
you could learn still more of welding
problems and needs, and could soon be
of value in the application of welding.
Some of his Company's products are
intricately shaped. You have learned that
diecasting is used to the limit, but that
apparently plastics have been left alone.
You learned something about plastics in
college, and have picked up a good deal
more from recent publications. You do
not rudely take the gentleman to task for
not having lost his head over plastics,
but you do find a chance to say how
fascinating it would be to have a job
where such adaptations might work well
and save money.
Of course, all such preparation may
usually miss the mark. As long as you are
an outsider, you may never be able to
smoke out a thing the company isn't al-
ready alive to and worried about. The
point is, that the employer will be pleas-
antly astounded to interview a recent
graduate who is thinking more of the em-
ployer's problem than his own. You will
not be hired that day; he can think of no
excuse for wedging you in. Two weeks or
three months later, that man may call you
long distance (provided you include your
telephone number in your record) and
ask if you can go to work next Monday.
On Knowing Your Way About
Ann Arbor, population 25,000, four
bookstores. Largetown, population 250,-
000, forty bookstores. Would you be-
lieve it? Of course not. Unless Large-
town has a college or two, probably the
only bookstores it ever had went to the
wall in 1933. Why not be equally acute
about some of the simpler, more acces-
sible factors that will affect your job-find-
ing problem? Two states have equal areas,
equal populations. Therefore, equal engi-
neering opportunity? Certainly not. That
depends on industrial development. Some
simple measures of states, their develop-
ment, their share in national income, can
be found in the World Almanac. Or you
might borrow the most recent national
membership list for your professional
society, to count up the proportion of
national membership represented by a
state or region in which you wish to lo-
cate. Why? Isn't it fair to assume that
roughly, engineering opportunity is pro-
portionate to the degree in which a city's
engineers are found in your society?
Often our line of preference will lead
you to special questions not answerable
by those who are convenient to your per-
sonal approach. If you wish to work at
improving leather processing, you have
to know where the leather business is.
McRae's Blue Book is a register of Amer-
ican industry. There is undoubtedly a na-
tional leather association, anxious to an-
swer letters. You pay taxes to support
bureaus in Washington that know the
answers to such questions. Use the privi-
lege. The Polk people publish a guide
to Detroit's business and industry. You
can buy a copy for fifty dollars or you
can walk into a hotel in Detroit and use
free of charge the copy that is chained to
the desk.
In the job conference with E.E. seniors
(last year) the seniors were asked to
name some companies they had thought
of tackling. About ten companies—all
large-—were rapidly nominated. I had
with me a January trade journal which
was filled with annual survey reports. One
such listed about thirty leading manufac-
turers, and showed whether they had
made or lost money in the preceding two
years. Eight of the ten companies named
had lost money. A number of firms that
had already climbed out of the red were
not mentioned. There are about six hun-
dred electrical manufacturing companies
in the United States. Why do great num-
bers of electrical graduates concentrate
their attention on the few? And isn't it
too bad, when at a given time, energy
directed towards getting into these few
may be almost entirely wasted?
While this article was being written,
Mr. Clifford A. Faust of Transit Journal,
and vice-president of Eta Kappa Nu As-
sociation, dropped in. He has been in
charge of the association's placement work
in New York. In a large share of cases in
which unemployed engineers came to
him, he found they had religiously hound-
ed eight or ten companies, and had culti-
vated few, if any other contacts. A sur-
vey disclosed the fact that several hundred
New York firms employed one or more
electrical engineers. These were the firms
where the job hunters were finally placed.
The Bulletin Board
In order to make a point later on, the
bulletin board should be mentioned. In
the writer's department the bulletin board
is made to serve a variety of educational
functions. Routine matters are of course,
posted there. In addition, a rather con-
tinuous parade of items is run throughout
the year. Many of the features described
in these articles are presented in one form
or another. The senior is given plenty of
opportunity to inform himself as to what
is expected of him in participating in our
particular placement scheme. When a
significant book appears, such as that by
Lester (mentioned in the first article),
sales-minded seniors are urged to read it.
About halfway through the year, the bul-
letin board announces—
The Job Conference
This annual event is mainly for seniors
of the electrical department. Starting at
7:30 p.m., with about 70 men present, it
ends at 11:00 because we have to go home
sometime. It is an open forum, devoted
entirely to rapidfire questions and answers
about the very things these articles are
trying to cover. Should one return for
graduate work? Should he do so right
away, or get some experience first? Does
a rolling stone gather any moss, or any-
thing else? What about these training
programs? What are present starting
rates? What to do when an outside offer
comes to a man already employed?
These are lengthy matters. This article
has no room for discussing them. If you
want to hear them talked about, you are
welcome to attend the conference. I will
offer to write about them in future ar-
ticles, provided a sufficient number of
readers will let me know their wishes.
Perhaps you had better tell the Editor
about it at the same time. It would be
up to him, you know.
Seniors—Live and Otherwise
The live senior will inform himself on
job matters long before his active con-
tacts begin. A large share of the things
he wants to know are common to the
whole class. It is out of the question for
any faculty member to find time to dish
out the answers to individual seniors.
Hence bulletin board service. And then
comes the test. When a senior drops in
along about May and innocently asks
some question that reveals he has not kept
himself posted, and when discussion re-

Color TV Picture Tube Screen
In a color television picture tube screen,
three different phosphor materials may be
placed in an interspersed dot pattern on
a glass plate, a phosphor for each of three
primary colors, red, blue, and green. Here
D. J. Bracco, engineer at Sylvania Re-
search Laboratories, uses a photographic
method of forming the complex screen.
Light from the point source zirconium
lamp passes through an aperture plate
containing more than 200,000 precisely
spaced small holes. Rays of light fall in
the desired dot pattern on a photographic
emulsion containing the color phosphor.
After controlled exposure and processing,
only the phosphor remains in the pattern.
The process is repeated for the other two
phosphors with the screen and aperture
plates moved slightly to permit the new
dots to fall between those previously
formed. A full color picture is produced
by each of three electron streams being
made to fall on the appropriate set of
color phosphor dots.
Electronic Counter
A Tube that counts at rates up to 2,000
pulses per second and that can remember
the number of pulses—is one of the new-
est additions to the family of electronic
devices developed by Bell Laboratories
and currently in production at Western
Electric's Allentown (Pa.) plant. Pulses
fed into the tube, which is designated is
the 6167 stepping tube, progresses from
one to another of the tube's multiple-
cathodes. Each cathode glows as it re-
ceives a pulse; last cathode to receive a
pulse continues to glow when the pulses
stop. At the resumption of the pulse
series, the tube begins stepping from the
last pulse registered. The tube's counting
can be registered on electrical recording
devices.

used for diagnostic purposes, the electro-
myograph may prove to have therapeutic
value as well.
The electromyograph, not unlike the
electroencephalograph, which measures
brain electrical impulses, or the electro-
cardiograph, which measures heat im-
pulses, "broadcasts" muscle impulses.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


ment of Physical Medicine and Rehabili-
tation at the U-M Medical School, reports
that the use of the "myograph" is still in
the experimental stage.
Small lead contact points are pasted to
the patient's chest or limbs, and the ma-
chine picks up muscle spasms electroni-
cally.
"Since the patient can hear these spasms
as they come through a loud speaker and
see them as they are reproduced in wave
form on a special screen, he is often en-
couraged to use those muscles which ap-
pear to him to be hopelessly impaired,"
reports Dr. Koepke.
Physical medicine, a comparatively new
field, is concerned with the emotional and
physical adjustment of patients after they
have passed through the more acute and
critical phases of their illnesses. Many
patients must learn to walk again and to
feed themselves.
The restoration of the polio patient
who has suffered weakness of respiratory
muscles has been of such challenge that,
as Dr. Koepke says, "Whenever we find
a device or technique which promises to
be a useful method of treatment, we are
a step closer to recovery."
An electromyograph, providing the
doctor and the patient with a visible pic-
ture of muscular spasms, may be such a
step, because it tells the patient what
muscles he is using, and therefore, is a
guide in developing a better pattern of
breathing.
To the doctor it is a valuable device,
because in addition to "telling" him
where therapy should be applied, it al-
lows still pictures to be taken of the vary-
ing wave patterns of muscles as their
spasms are reproduced on the electro-
myograph's built-in screen.
A-C Displays Largest Single
Radiograph
A 40 by 120-inch radiograph, the larg-
est yet produced on a single piece of film,
was displayed by Allis-Chalmers Manu-
facturing Company.
The giant magnification of two Win-
chester rifles—an old buffalo weapon and
a modern piece—was accomplished with
an Allis-Chalmers 22 mev betatron by
using a "magna scanning" technicjue.
Magnification of the rifles was accom-
plished by direct geometrical enlargement
with the film placed eight feet from the
specimen. The target to specimen dis-
tance was four feet and the target to
film distance 12 feet. This resulted in
a magnification factor of three. The scan-
ning arc traversed was about 40 degrees

which resulted in the center of the X-ray
beam being swept across the full length
of the specimen.
This technicjue when employed in in-
dustrial radiography has been successful
in revealing details of flaws down to
.001 inch. A fine focal point and mini-
mum secondary scattering are absolute
necessities in this operation.
The scanning technique used in pro-
ducing this radiograph is similar to the
old panorama picture in that the betatron
is rotated during the exposure just as the
camera was rotated while the lens was
open. In this operation the focal spot
must remain effectively fixed in space
while the betatron rotates with only the
direction of the emitted X-ray beam
changing.
Industrially this method is best applied
to repetitive jobs which justify technique
development.

from DOW CORNING "Silicone Notes"
The unusual combination of physical and
chemical properties exhibited by silicone
polymers male them extremely useful to in-
dustry. These compounds are inorganic
analogies to the more familiar carbon com-
pounds; the close proximity of carbon and
silicon on the periodic table might lead
one to expect this. But silicones are built
on a molecular skeleton of silicon-oxygen
atoms while hydrocarbons are built on a
skeleton of carbon to carbon atoms.
Since the bond energy of the silicon-
A few years ago, "silicone paint" re-
ferred only to a small group of baked-on
coatings which, when applied according
to rather rigid specifications, exhibited a
remarkable degree of resistance to corro-
sion and extreme temperatures. Today,
silicone-based paints include hundreds of
coatings, each with its own individual
properties and advantages.
Generally speaking, all silicone-based
finishes fall into one of three groups. First
are those with a 100% silicone resin
vehicle which are baked on to provide
maximum heat and corrosion resistance.
Formulations in the second group are
based on combinations of silicone and or-
ganic resin vehicles, and are characterized
by better film properties, adhesion, and
hardness. Some of these are baking
finishes, but their curing schedules are
relatively short. The third group is based
on certain new silicone resins which have
moderate heat stability and which com-
bine air drying with a remarkable degree
of weather resistance.
All of these finishes have certain char-
acteristics in common, the most note-
worthy of which is their resistance to
thermal or chemical change. This sta-
bility is inherent in the molecular struc-
ture of the organo-silicon polymer itself.
The polymer is based on a silicon-to-
oxygen linkage like that found in quartz,
a linkage which is iy2 times stronger
than the carbon-to-carbon link found in
all of the organic materials. By a series
of chemical processes, organic groups are
also attached to the silicon atom; con-
verting a hard, brittle substance into a
flexible, solvent-soluble material which
can easily be handled.
Variations in the types of organic
groups and the degree of substitution pro-
duce a family of products ranging from
fluids to gums and resins. The members
of this family are characterized by a high
degree of resistance to oxidation or chem-
oxygen linkage is I 72 times as great as the
bond energy of the carbon-carbon linkage,
the silicone chains have greater stability
than the corresponding carbon chains. The
properties this structure lends—chemical
stability, heat resistance, water repellancy,
lowering of surface tension in liquids, to
name a few—all combine to make these
valuable materials indeed.
Silicones may be divided into five rough
categories: Silicone Rubber (used to make
gaskets, tubing, and a variety of mechani-
cal goods), Silicone Fluids (used for
ical attack, by remarkable thermal sta-
bility, water repellency and by good
dielectric properties.
These properties are present to some
extent in all silicone-based paints, mak-
ing them unusually resistant to moisture,
oxidation, ultra-violet and other causes of
corrosion. All are remarkably free from
blistering, crazing, chalking, fading and
other results of weathering and chemical
attack.
The heat stability of any one silicone-
based finish, however, depends upon a
number of factors, including the type and
proportion of silicone resin the pigment
used, blending methods and even appli-
cation procedure.
"Straight Silicone" Paint
The oldest and best known silicone
finishes are the baked-on coatings known
as "straight silicone." Ordinarily these
formulations contain an inorganic pig-
ment and a vehicle made up entirely of
one or more silicone resins.
They may be applied by brush or spray,
but the working surface must be abso-
lutely clean and dry. For best results, the
surface should be sand blasted to promote
maximum adhesion. One coat is usually
sufficient, but maximum protection is
obtained with two coats. The surface
should not be hot during application, but
heat must be applied soon after. Curing
schedules range from eight hours at
400°F to one hour at 500°F, depending
upon the circumstances. In many mainten-
ance applications complete curing is ac-
complished simply by putting the refinish-
ed unit back into service.
A large number of straight silicone
paints are pigmented with aluminum
powder, although other inorganic mater-
ials such as zinc dust, flaked stainless steel
and even powdered mica may be used. In
the presence of extreme temperatures, the
silicone resin will gradually decompose
polishes, water repellents, etc.), Silicone
Resins (used to make plastics, protective
finishes, etc.), Specialties (such as emul-
sions, antifoaming agents, etc.), and in-
termediate organosilicon chemicals for
process industries.
The following article is a survey of the
advances that have been made in applying
silicones to just one relatively narrow field,
protective coatings. The progress that has
been made here should lend insight into
the potentialities of these remarkable com-
pounds.
to silica, bonding the metallic pigment
even tighter to the coated surface, and
providing added resistance to corrosion.
Colored pigments do not ordinarily re-
tain their bonding properties at elevated
temperatures, and will lose adhesion as
the silicone decomposes.
Laboratory tests indicate that straight
silicone paint pigmented with aluminum
can withstand intermittent exposure to
temperatures as high as 1000°F. Substi-
tution of inorganic mineral pigment, how-
ever, will reduce the maximum operating
temperature of the finish to 500°F.
Temperature stability, of course, is only
part of the story. Actually, many organic
formulations perform well when heat re-
sistance is the only governing factor. It
is when a high degree of corrosion resis-
tance is also required that straight silicone
finishes demonstrate their marked super-
iority to any other coatings available.
Their resistance to extreme heat plus
weathering and chemical attack is dem-
onstrated by their performance in the
petroleum processing industry. On stacks,
exhaust mufflers and other outdoor high
temperature refinery equipment, straight
silicone coatings outlast conventional
paints as many as ten to twenty times.
A typical example was a line of exhaust
mufflers which were cleaned and repainted
with the best heat-resistant organic
finishes on an average of once a month.
Surface temperatures ranging alternately
from 400° to 800°F, plus corrosive atmo-
spheric conditions, blistered and cracked
each fresh coating almost as fast as it was
applied. A two-coat finish of straight
silicone-aluminum paint has lasted over
two years to date with no sign of crack-
ing, blistering or darkening.
Modified Silicone Finishes
The curing requirements of the straight
silicone formulations obviously limit their
applications to units which can either be
16
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


■which can be subjected to controlled high
temperatures in service.
In an effort to overcome this limitation
without sacrificing the advantages of the
silicones, a different type of vehicle was
developed. This was the silicone-alkyd, or
modified silicone resin, hailed by many
formulators as the most outstanding de-
velopment in paint formulation since the
development of the alkyd resins.
Several factors govern the performance
of modified silicone finishes. Their heat
and corrosion resistance vary according to
their silicone resin content, which may
range from 10% to 90%. The type of or-
ganic resin employed also makes a differ-
ence, as does the method used to combine
the resinous components.
It is possible to formulate two modified
silicone resins having the same basic
chemical composition. One, by cold blend-
ing of silicone resins with organic resins,
the other by cooking silicone (interme-
diates) with various organic resin com-
ponents. Although the silicone contents
are identical, the cooked formulation will
usually display much superior weather
resistance and heat stability.
Although modified silicone finishes do
not have the combined heat and corrosion
resistance of the straight silicones, they
are well suited for factory application on
original equipment designed for service
in the 300° to 500°F range. They have
better adhesion to metal than straight
silicone finishes, they develop a tougher
film, and they cure much faster.
As far as temperature resistance is con-
cerned, a modified finish containing a
90% silicone vehicle would probably
withstand continuous exposure to 400°F
indefinitely. If the silicone content is re-
duced to 75%, the finish would still give
extended service at 400°F. But if the sili-
cone was reduced to 25% of the vehicle,
the finish would only give extended serv-
ice at 350°F.
Of course, 350°F is just about the limit
of the best organic coatings. Modified
silicone finishes, therefore, offer users
maximum durability at elevated tempera-
tures in a coating which may be easily ap-
plied with conventional equipment.
As such, they are rapidly winning ac-
ceptance as protective coatings for stoves,
space heaters, engine exhaust mufflers, air-
craft components and other equipment
which is subject to heat and corrosion.
Several formulations are serving in place
of metal plating, and others are being
seriously considered as replacements for
vitreous enamel.
Because most conventional pigments
stand up well within the limits of the
silicone-alkyd vehicle, the color range for
modified silicone finishes is almost un-
limited. Powdered aluminum is popular
where extra resistance to corrosion or
heat is desired.
Curing schedules compare favorably
with those for comparable conventional
finishes. In many cases they are substan-
tially shortened, simply because their extra
heat stability permits them to be baked
at temperatures beyond the limits of or-
ganic finishes. Hardness and glass reten-
tion are also on a par with conventional
coatings.
While the corrosion resistance of modi-
fied silicone paint does not equal that of
straight silicone, it is definitely superior
to that of most conventional finishes. To
demonstrate this and other properties
of modified silicone finishes, a leading
formulator coated two identical ordnance
heater shells and subjected them to a salt
spray test.
The first shell was finished with con-
ventional olive drab and cured for 45
minutes at 250°F. The other was finish-
ed in modified silicone olive drab, cured
for only 30 minutes at 400°F.
After being held at a surface tempera-
ture of 500°F for 4 hours, both shells
were subjected to constant salt spray. In
100 hours the organic coating had de-
teriorated almost to the point of disap-
pearance and the shell was barely rusted.
After 300 hours, or three times as long,
the modified silicone coating began to
show signs of corrosion. Its color reten-
tion and glass were for the most part as
good as ever.
Air-Drying Modified Silicone Finishes
Still largely under laboratory develop-
ment is a new series of silicone resins
with almost spectacular possibilities.
Modified,silicone finishes based on these
resins can be applied in the same manner
and on the same materials as conventional
exterior paints, and will air dry in about
the same length of time. Yet they exhibit
almost the same degree of weather re-
sistance as the best baked-on straight sili-
cone paints.
Test panels and actual examples in
the field show little change from their
original appearance after more than a
year's exposure to weathering in the
chemically-laden atmosphere present in
Midland, Michigan. Finishes show little
tendency toward cracking, crazing, fading
or chalking. They retain a high degree of
gloss, and they are highly water repellent.
All silicone-based finishes are water
repellent, of course, but this property is
considered only a minor feature in high
temperature coatings. The fact that this
finish air dries, however, means that it
can be applied, for instance, to wood.
The ability to prevent water from forming
a continuous film over its surface means
greatly increased service life and im-
proved appearance.
Finishes based on these new resins will
also resist temperatures above the limits
of organic paints by simply curing in
service. On power house stacks, for in-
stance, where temperatures may range
from 450°F at the base to zero at the
top, the finish will bake on after drying
when subjected to elevated temperatures.
A wide range of formulations based on
these new resins, including several clear
varnishes, are now undergoing severe
testing and evaluation. Although optimum
concentrations are not yet established, in-
dications are that this material will have a
pronounced effect on the field of outdoor
protective and decorative coatings.
Silicone Fluid Additives
Silicones are not only used as resinous
vehicles for paint, but also as fluid addi-
tives during formulation. The addition of
only trace quantities of silicone fluid to
a wide range of organic coatings has a
definitely repressive effect on floating and
silking.
These difficulties are due to premature
or uneven separation of pigment and
vehicle after a coating has been applied.
Silicone fluid lends stability to the formu-
lation, holding the pigment in suspension
until the paint film has thoroughly dried.
Surprisingly economical, the fluid is effec-
tive in concentrations as low as 10 parts
per million.
When the concentration of silicone
additive is raised to the range of 0.01 to
0.2%, it imparts a degree of extra
smoothness, stain resistance, and water
repellency to the finish which cannot be
obtained through use of silicone resins.
For silicone-based finishes, today is a
time of trial, experiment and comparison.
With so many variables to consider, opti-
mum formulations are subject to much
change and revision. This condition may
well prevail for some time, because only
time can accurately measure either heat
stability or corrosion resistance, the lead-
ing properties of all silicone-based finishes.
The future of silicone-based finishes lies
not in our laboratories, but in the in-
genuity, skill and patience of formulators
and finishers all over the country.

National Bureau of Standards
With the Increasing complexity of mod-
ern warfare has come a need for more and
more electronic equipment and electrical
circuits. During World War II the mass
production of electronic equipment was,
compared to the production of mechanical
equipment, a slow process due to the fact
that much of this equipment had to be
wired by hand.
The Armed Services realized this and the
National Bureau of Standards under the
sponsorship of the Navy began work on
this problem. What they came up with, a
system for mass producing electronic equip-
ment, might very well revolutionize the elec-
tronics industry. Following is the Bureau of
Standards report on the Modu'ar Design
of Electronics and Mechanized Production
of Electronics or PROJECT TINKERTOY.
An automatic production line for the
manufacture of electronic products and a
novel system of electronics design which
makes this possible have been developed
by the National Bureau of Standards. The
program, code-named PROJECT TINK-
ERTOY, was sponsored by the Navy
Bureau of Aeronautics.
Starting from raw or semi-processed
materials, machines automatically manu-
facture ceramic materials and adhesive
carbon resistors, print conducting circuits,
and mount resistors, capacitors, and other
miniaturized component parts on stand-
ard uniform steatite wafers. The wafers
are stacked very much like building
blocks to form a module that performs
all of the functions of one or more elec-
tronic stages. Automatic inspection ma-
chines check physical and electrical charac-
teristics of the parts-mounted wafers at
numerous stations along the production
line. The completed module is a standard-
ized, interchangeable subassembly com-
bining all of the requirements of an elec-
tronic circuit with ruggedness, reliability,
and extreme compactness.
I. Description of Project
PROJECT TINKERTOY, as the pro-
gram is code-named, was begun by NBS
in May 1950 and now successfully pro-
duces electronic subassemblies by mech-
anized means. The pilot plant is operated
by a commercial contractor as part of a
large-scale production evaluation program
under the Bureau's technical direction.
The basic objective of the Navy Bureau
of Aeronautics in establishing the pro-
gram was the development of facilities or
systems suitable for rapid mobilization in
emergency periods. The facilities are also
dual-purposed in nature and are expected
to substantially reduce lead time in pro-
duction.
MDE Design System
The key to the automatic, mechanized
production of electronic equipment in
PROJECT TINKERTOY is the design
system developed by the National Bureau
of Standards. Called MDE—for Modular
Design of Electronics—the system estab-
lishes a series of mechanically standard-
ized and uniform modules (or building
blocks), producible with a wide range of
electrical characteristics.
Each module, in general, consists of
some 4 to 6 thin ceramic wafers, bearing
various circuits associated with an elec-
tronic stage. A number of individual mod-
ules are combined to form a major sub-
assembly. The composition of modules
into major subassemblies of electronic
equipment is possible because there is
great similarity between circuits and parts
of circuits in modern electronic equip-
ment.
Electronic assemblies consist largely of
electronic tubes and arrays of simple
parts (like resistors and capacitors) which
account for the mass of the individual
parts and are also responsible for the bulk
of the manual production efforts in con-
ventional production. These assemblies
have been the chief target for redesign
in the MDA system.
MPE Production System
The production of modules and assem-
blies, designed in accordance with the
MDE system, is achieved mechanically in
PROJECT TINKERTOY. The produc-
tion system developed by the National
Bureau of Standards is called MPE—
Mechanized Production of Electronics.
MPE largely utilizes non-critical raw ma-
terials. Ceramic wafers—7/8 inch square
by 1/16 inch thick—are produced directly
in quantity from the raw ingredients.
Ceramic capacitors are produced in a simi-
lar fashion. Another part of the line pro-
duces adhesive tape resistors.
These and other basic parts are fed into
the production line. The appropriate cir-
cuits configuration is achieved through
photographic processing. Quality control
is established by automatic inspection, di-
rected by information prepared in punch-
ed card form. Special components, not
suitable for "printing" techniques, can be
incorporated into the modules. Automatic
physical and electrical inspection is pro-
vided for in the production line.
The MPE system is based on the use
of bulk or semiprocessed materials, and
the line produces all the large-quantity
parts except for the tubes. The pilot
plant is designed for a production goal of
1,000 modules per hour. Joining modules
together to form subassemblies may also
be accomplished by machines.
PROJECT TINKERTOY was sponsor-
ed by the Industrial Planning Division of
the Navy Bureau of Aeronautics as an in-
dustrial preparedness measure. One of the
serious bottlenecks in emergency periods
has turned out to be the production of
electronic equipment, upon which the
military services are increasingly depen-
dent for success in modern defense.
PROJECT TINKERTOY indicates that
lead time in production can be reduced 75
percent.
2. Modular Design of Electronics
MDE is the basis for the PROJECT
TINKERTOY system. In such a system
flexibility of product and the general
characteristics of conventional assembly
methods are compatibly combined. At the
same time product standardization and
uniformity—the prerequisites for econom-
ical processing by automatic machinery—
are integral aspects of the system. Inter-
connection is relatively simple between
any number of modular units. By com-
bining modular assemblies containing dif-
ferent component parts (resistors, capaci-
tors, coils, etc.) whole electronic circuits
may be developed to amplify signals, gen-
erate and shape wave forms, scale count,
and perform customary electronic func-
tions.
The MDE design system dispenses with
the conventional circuit diagram of the
tested electronic model and places all
necessary production programming in-
formation on an MDE work sheet. Each
work sheet contains the front and back
outlines of six wafers with appropriate
numbering to identify each notch in the
wafer, each riser wire, and the electronic
piece that is to be placed on the wafer.
The engineer translates his conventional
wiring diagram to an MDE diagram. He

The engineer's MDE work sheet be-
comes the basic document from which a

of the work sheet that is photographed

tablish the inspection procedure. Current
paths on each wafer are marked on
specially prepared punch cards. These
cards accompany the wafers through all
of the manufacturing processes. The sheet
is also used in the construction of the
standard modules or counterparts that are
employed in the final testing and inspec-
tion of the module assembly.
3. Mechanized Production of Electronics
MPE consists of the mechanized pro-
duction of ceramic wafers, titanate capaci-
tors, and tape resistors and their automatic
mechanical assembly and inspection. In
some military equipment a single chassis
may have as many as 100 resistors and
100 capacitors. The facilities of the NBS
PROJECT TINKERTOY plant provides
for the manufacture of nearly all of these
pieces from raw materials.
MPE Steatite Production
Steatite wafers and tube sockets are
processed from raw materials and are
stamped out at a rate of about 2800 pieces
per hour. These parts are cured at 2300°F
in a tunnel kiln. The wafers are then
mechanically gaged, and all pieces which
do not fit within close tolerances are re-
jected.
The standard wafer is pressed with
twelve peripheral notches (three on a
side) and a keying notch on one side. In
the final module assembly, riser wires are
mechanically soldered into the twelve
notches and serve as physical supports for
the module and electrical connectors be-
tween wafer-mounted circuits. The keying
notch is a medium by which individual
wafers arc automatically oriented for the
PROJECT TINKERTOY
(Continued from page 18)
mechanical application of component
parts.
MPE Capacitor
The titanate capacitor body is manufac-
tured in PROJECT TINKERTOY in very
much the same manner as the ceramic
wafers. The capacitor is non-porous
ceramic composed usually of magnesium,
barium, and strontium titanates of high
purity, organic binders and water. After
firing, it is about y2 inch square and
2/100 inch thick. The capacity values
may be varied from 7.0 micromicrofarads
to 0.01 microfarad by changing the rela-
tive proportions of the constituent min-
erals. Raw material batches weighing
about five pounds will produce about
100,000 capacitors.
MPE Tape Resistor Production
The materials for the manufacture of
tape resistors in PROJECT TINKERTOY
are a heat-resistant asbestos paper tape
known as Quinterra, polyethylene tape,
carbon black or graphite, resin, and a sol-
vent. The resistor formulation (a mixture
of the carbon, resin, and solvent) is
ground to a fine adhesive powder. The
compound is then sprayed on a loop of
Quinterra tape, and a protective coating
of polyethylene tape is applied. The tape
is slit into five or six narrow strips and
stored on rolls in a refrigerator. A 75-
foot roll of tape will produce over 10,000
resistors. The tape resistors produced
have a range from .10 ohms to 10
megohms. They will hold their rated re-
sistance within ± 10 percent up to tem-
peratures near 200° F and are capable
of l^-watt power dissipation at the oper-
ating temperature.
MPE Metallizing
Metallizing is the name given to a
series of operations in the PROJECT
TINKERTOY plant in which appropriate
sections of the wafer or capacitor body
are silverpainted. During these stages,
circuits are printed on the wafers, notches
are coated, conducting surfaces and leads
are applied to capacitors, furnace-curing
takes place, and circuits are inspected.
Finally, all silvered surfaces received a
thin coating of solder. All of the opera-
tions are mechanized.
MPE Materials Handling
The keying notch pressed into each
wafer is initially used during the metal-
lizing operations. The wafers are loaded
into vibratory bowl feeders provided with
spiral escape channels. A series of four
exist ports followed by steps are set into
the channels. A small screw is inserted
into each exit port that permits only those
wafers to pass if the key is aligned with
the screw. If the wafer is incorrectly
oriented, it is turned 90 degrees as it
falls down the channel step following
the exit port. A specially grooved chan-
nel inverts the wafer if it has failed to
pass through the other four ports, and
the keying procedure is repeated. As a
consequence, all wafers passing from the
feeders are oriented in the same direction
and have the same surface turned upward.
Another feature of the vibratory bowl
feeders is the mechanism that controls the
quantity of wafers being issued. The is-
suing channel is provided with a photo-
electric cell that functions only if the light
path is completed. If the channel is not
filled with wafers, the completed photo-
cell light path energizes the circuit caus-
ing the bowl to vibrate. When the chan-
nel is full, the bowl automatically stops
vibrating and, therefore, issuing wafers.
MPE Components Assembly
Tape resistors, titanate capacitors, tube-
sockets, and other miniaturized parts are
mounted on the wafers between the ap-
propriate silvered conducting patterns.
Rolls of resistor tape are placed on a ma-
chine that automatically cuts the tape into
one-half inch lengths, presses the resistors
between the printed electrodes on the sur-
face of the wafer, applies pressure, and
ejects the completed resistor-mounted
wafer. As many as two resistor tapes may
be applied to each wafer surface.
A single machine is used to mount up
to two capacitors on each surface of a
wafer. Each capacitor is automatically
oriented and the silvered circuit on both
surfaces is electrically tested before
mounting. For example, if four capacitors
are to be mounted on a wafer, the first
two are dropped into a conveyor-driven
jig. They are followed by a slave that
centers the capacitors, and the properly
oriented wafer is added. The remaining
two capacitors are dropped on top of the
wafer. The jig is conveyed through a pair
of induction heaters that cause the tinned
surfaces on the parts to bond.
In the tube socket assembler, silvered
tube pins are mechanically placed into
their proper holes in the steatite tube
socket, a wafer is placed on top of the
socket, and a rivet binds the two pieces

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Do you want to get ahead in engineering?
Then—after you graduate—join a com-
pany that's expanding in fields where
big engineering futures lie.
At Boeing you'll find plenty of room
to get ahead in such projects-with-a-
future as a major guided missile program
. . . research in supersonic flight and
nuclear-powered aircraft . . . America's
first-announced jet transport. . . and the
revolutionary B-47 and B-52 jet bombers.
You'll find Boeing a stable 37-year-old
company, that has grown practically con-
tinuously. For example, Boeing now
employs 6000 engineers in contrast to
3500 at the peak of World War II.
And although Boeing is a large concern,
it is so organized that each engineer is
an individual who stands out—and pro-
gresses—in proportion to his ability.
Boeing is constantly alert to new tech-
niques and materials — and approaches
them without limitations. Extensive sub-
contracting and major procurement
programs — directed and controlled by
engineers—give you a varied experience
and broad contacts with a cross section
of American industry. No industry, in
fact, matches aviation in offering such
a wide range of experience, or breadth
of application — from pure research to
production design, all going on at once.
Boeing engineering activity is concen-
trated at Seattle in the Pacific North-
west, and Wichita in the Midwest. These
communities offer* a wide variety of rec-
reational opportunities. Both are fresh,
modern cities with fine residential and
shopping districts, and schools of higher
learning where you can study for ad-
vanced degrees.
There are openings in ALL branches
of engineering (mechanical, civil, elec-
trical, aeronautical, and related fields),
for DESIGN, RESEARCH and PRODUCTION.
Also for servo-mechanism and electron-
ics designers and analysts, as well as
physicists and mathematicians with
advanced degrees.

After the various parts have been
mounted on the wafers, the notches on
the wafer are tinned with solder. The
machine that performs this operation
automatically grips each component-
mounted wafer and dips one side into
flux and solder. The tinning operation is
repeated on the other sides after succes-
sive 90 degree turns of the wafer.
MPE Module Assembly
Uniform wafer-mounted component
parts, including wafer-mounted coils,
toroids, potentiometers, and crystals are
now ready for assembly. The complete as-
sembly of the module is accomplished in
a single machine. Six vibratory feeders
issue the wafers to a loading device that
holds the wafers in an upright position
between specifically designed jaws. A
chain drive carries the jig to a soldering
position at which six riser wires are guid-
ed into appropriate notches, three on a
side. The mechanism brings soldering
irons in contact with the unit and bonds
the wires to the notches. The unit is turn-
ed 90 degrees, and the chain drive carries
it to another soldering position where six
more wires are bonded to the module.
After final electrical inspection, segments
of riser wires are severed where circuit
isolation is required between wafer-
mounted circuits.
MPE Automatic Inspection
During each stage in the mechanized
production of electronics, provision is
made for 100-percent automatic inspec-
tion. This is both a physical gaging and
an electrical comparison. Printed circuits,
resistors, and capacitors are compared
with their electronic equivalents both be-
fore and after assembly. This is accom-
plished by use of electronic computers,
bridge circuits, and other comparison de-
vices. The inspection "code" is contained
on the punched cards which were prepar-
ed by the design engineer and have ac-
companied the wafers all through the
production process. After the final as-
sembly of the module the whole circuit
is again tested to see that it meets specifi-
cations within set tolerances.
Final Assembly
The final assembly operation need not
necessarily be considered a part of the
Mechanized Production of Electronics.
Normally, a set of modules (as many as
ten) are mounted on or between copper-
clad base plates. Circuits have been etched
PROJECT TINKERTOY
(Continued from page 22)
into the copper surface and connect the
riser wires of the several modules to form
a complete electronic circuit. Several such
plate assemblies may form an equipment.
One base plate with six modules, for in-
stance, contains all the necessary circuits
to make a six-tube radio receiver function
properly.
4. Industrial Preparedness
Industrial mobilization and prepared-
ness have been studied by the Industrial
Planning Division of the Navy Bureau
of Aeronautics for many years. In study-
ing the electronic industry it was con-
cluded that in the event of a national
emergency costs for production and main-
tenance of electronics would be formid-
able in view of the quantities and varieties
of needed gear. Consequently the Navy
Bureau of Aeronautics decided that the
only solution to the problem of satisfying
the huge demands for electronic equip-
ment was a mechanized production sys-
tem.
The Navy turned to the National
Bureau of Standards in 1950 for the solu-
tion of these industrial mobilization
problems. The National Bureau of Stand-
ards had engaged in pioneering work in
printed electronic circuits, stemming from
problems arising in its proximity fuse
work during World War II. Prior to
1950, the Bureau had developed a modu-
lar design concept, tape resistors, special
circuit printing techniques, and hand-ma-
chines for printed circuits in connection
with various research and development
projects. Problems of miniaturization and
ruggedization of electronic equipment
had also been under study for some time.
The first modular design of military
electronic equipment had been completed
by NBS in 1949, when a radar interme-
diate frequency assembly had been design-
ed and constructed. A careful study by
the Navy in 1950 indicated that "the
most advanced state of processed circuitry
is available at the National Bureau of
Standards." The NBS system was particu-
larly compatible with military environ-
mental requirements, and stressed maxi-
mum use of raw materials rather than
pre-processed component parts. The ma-
jor objective of the program became the
design and construction of a pilot plant
compatible with the principles of Modu-
lar Design of Electronics.
PROJECT TINKERTOY makes pos-
sible a rapid conversion from civilian to
military products (and back again) on
short notice and, concurrently, allows a
greatly expanded production capacity. De-
lays caused by the need for recruiting
and training new production personnel
and the procurement of new mechanisms
and parts are eliminated. Most of the
operating "know-how" is stored in me-
chanical fingers and electromechanical
control mechanisms, and even electronic
equipment design may be stored, ready
for production, in the form of punched
cards and circuit stencil screens.
Because PROJECT TINKERTOY
largely utilizes unprocessed or bulk ma-
terials, the system is comparatively free
from dependence on particular compon-
ents in critical supply. The Mechanized
Production of Electronics results in a very
high production rate. Uniformity of elec-
tronic products at a high quality level is
enhanced by the mechanized production
and by 100% automatic inspection. This
affords the possibility of repair and main-
tenance of electronic systems by replace-
ment of unitized packages or entire sub-
assemblies.
Performance of equipments produced
in PROJECT TINKERTOY appears gen-
erally equivalent to that obtainable from
conventional assemblies. Equipment pro-
duced on an experimental basis meet mili-
tary environmental'requirements, passing
such tests as shock, vibration, temperature,
and humidity established in military speci-
fications. Moreover, the standardization
and uniformity achieved by the MDE
wafer-component and stacked-wafer de-
sign result in production outputs of uni-
formally satisfactory equipment, whose
characteristics both physically and electri-
cally are carefully controlled through the
100%-automatic inspection machines that
are an integral part of the production
line.
The final design and subsequent con-
struction of many PROJECT TINKER-
TOY machines called for the services and
assistance of industry at a time when the
Korean emergency had preempted most
machine-tool and related facilities. The
Navy and the National Bureau of Stand-
ards were able, however, to secure the co-
operation of several companies with avail-
able facilities and staff.
Basic conception and development—as
well as early background research—were
contributed by the National Bureau of
Standards, including solution of new

We were skeptical ourselves when our
photographer ran up to us and breath-
lessly announced his "amazing inven-
tion." By choosing all the words between
the superlatives we gathered that his in-
vention was amazing indeed; he had per-
fected a camera which tools pictures in
terms of analytical geometry!
Now we the editors of the Michigan
Technic, are exemplary products of an
engineering education—we examine facts
and keep our feet planted solidly on our
desk. But one look at the print he showed
us convinced us of the existence of the
camera.
And so it is that we present a negative
of the Technic's favorite pin up gal
Paula Coordinate, who poses exclusively
for our pages. The negative you will no-
tice is made up of points, lines, and
curves. Plotting these on the film, you
will meet our comely Paula.
Paula's lines are defined by their end-
points; her curves are well-defined; by
equations. The earring Paula wears was
given to her by her cousin Patsy Ordinate.
Well, without further ado, here she is.
Have as much fun developing her as we
did. For best results we recommend the
use of a light room.

Adventures
in
Research
THIS NEW FLASH POINT TESTING MACHINE is so accurate that a
sample with as little as 1/10 of 1% unsafe material in it will cause
a rejection. Recently developed by Standard Oil's Engineering
Research Department, this revolutionary device reduces the
average time from 20 minutes for a flash test to two and a half
minutes, avoids human errors in testing flash point, can be used
right at the loading rack.
The flash point testing problem that was
solved with the machine shown above is
only one of the many problems presented
to Standard Oil's new and growing Engi-
neering Research Department.
In the last few years, it has developed
and put into operation instruments to
measure vapor pressure, 158° point, acid-
ity and viscosity. Ultrasonic generators
have been built for general use in provid-
ing energy for experimental purposes.
The department is studying application
of radioactive isotopes to instrumenta-
tion and control problems related to re-
finery operation.
One of our research divisions is carry-
ing out an extensive theoretical study
of stresses in pressure vessels having flat,
conical, hemispherical, toriconical or tor-
ispherical heads.
In our work on product evaluation, we
have developed a new test for quenching
oils based on the fundamental heat
transfer relationships involved.
Problems such as these are the daily
fare of Standard Oil's Engineering Re-
search Department. Here is a challeng-
ing opportunity for young men with
advanced training in chemistry and
engineering. Many and varied problems
continually arise in the design, construc-
tion and operation of petroleum industry
equipment.

The two products illustrated presented the
same problem—how to carry rotary move-
ment around a turn. The designers might
have done it with combinations of straight
shafts, universals, bevel gears and other
mechanical elements. Instead, they saved
parts and costs by using S.S.White Flexible
Shafts, and they eliminated a lot of unnec-
essary assembly time and operations in the
bargain.

Many of the problems you'll face in in-

and catch onto things in a hurry, he may be in for a series
of disappointments for some time to come.
Keep In Touch
Soon after graduating, send a copy of your personal record
back to your faculty placement officer. As soon as you get that
job, let him know. Get out of the way, and let him concen-
trate on your unemployed classmate. Once a year or so, drop
him a letter, bringing yourself up to date. (Ask him to file
your letter without bothering to answer it: maybe, if he has a
spare moment, he'll answer it anyway) In a few years he will
have a complete file on you. Since you will be one of the few
who really do this, he will reach for you first when something
nice shows up.
While on one job, if you ever decide that you want to
make a change, you must be particularly sure to inform your
faculty member about it. He does not, for several reasons,
wish to bother you with offers in the usual case. He should and
will let you alone when your present opportunities are as
good where you are as it seems they would be elsewhere. More-
over, your company will properly resent it if we or anyone else
are continually bringing offers to your attention. Experienced
men know that a good share of a year's productive effort can
be seriously upset, if full consideration is given to but two
or three good offers a year. When you really wish to make a
change, tell somebody about it.

Step into
the Expanding Field
off Instrumentation
More and more industries are depending upon instru-
ments to control production, lines ... to solve research
problems ... to test products. Iron and steel, aircraft and
autos, chemicals and chinaware, petroleum and electrical
power are only a few of the many basic markets for con-
trolling and measuring equipment. As a result, expendi-
tures for instrumentation have been increasing yearly
until today they amount to several hundred millions of
dollars—a figure which will continue to increase.
This expansion continues to offer opportunities with
L&amp;N in sales engineering, product engineering, production,
market development, inspection and elsewhere. All uti-
lize technical training and offer a challenge to engineers.
Leeds &amp; Northrup makes automatic, high-precision, bal-
ancing-type electrical instruments for controlling, record-
ing and indicating temperature, chemical concentration,
electrolytic conductivity, frequency and load, combustion
and many other conditions. For the heat treaters we make
furnaces and process equipment. For the worker in science
—whether student or researcher—we make both automatic
and manual laboratory-type instruments, with which you
may already be familiar.
The Company has over 3,000 employees, with branches
in 17 U. S. cities and agents in forty-two other countries.
Profit-sharing and promotion by merit are foundations of
L&amp;N policy.
Take your first step toward the field of instrumentation
by arranging with your placement officer to see our com-
pany representative.

world's speed record. He said under Fed-
eration Aeronautique International rules
the fastest average speed for either the 15
or 3 kilometer course is recognized as the
top official world's mark. The FAI is the
international body which regulates all air
speed records.
Colonel Everest flew nearly 18 miles
in setting the new mark compared to a
total of 7.2 miles for a three kilometer
record.
Previous world record set by a Navy
F4D Skyray over a three kilometer course
was 753.4 miles per hour.
The top speed of 707.889 miles per
hour for a 15 kilometer course was set
September 1 at the National Aircraft
Show in Dayton, Ohio, by Air Force
Capr. Harold (Tom) Collins in a North
American F-86D Sabre Jet interceptor.
"This 15 kilometer course is a tough
one to fly because at least half of it is
over water and it is difficult to pick out
landmarks," the veteran test pilot declar-
ed. "It's much harder to hold a steady
course for such a long distance." Colonel
Everest previously had flown the F-100
over a nearby three kilometer course at an
average speed of 757 miles per hour.
Billowing black smoke marked each
end of the course and the shoreline at the
36
north end of the site to guide Colonel
Everest in his runs. Official timing was
with a Speed Graphic Pacemaker camera
with Polaroid Land Backs and an elec-
tronic counter chronograph.
The complete panning mechanism
was designed and built by North Ameri-
can.
Pulling up after his first pass within a
few minutes after takeoff from El Centro
Naval Air Station, Colonel Everest made
a sweeping turn and headed his plane
toward the course. "I'm going to kick her
in the tail," he radioed. Seconds later the
needle-like speed boom of the F-100
lanced across the finish line.
Although racing rules permit the 15
kilometer course to be run at any altitude
Colonel Everest held the F-100 within
100 feet of the ground on both passes.
The F-100, recently demonstrated to
the press at Palmdalc, Calif., is the Air
Force's first jet fighter capable of break-
ing through the sound barrier in level
flight at altitudes where it will fight.
The Super Sabre is powered by a Pratt
and Whitney J-57-7 turbo-jet engine
with afterburner. It is 45 feet long, 14
feet high and has a wing span of 36 feet.
It has a service ceiling above 50,000 feet
and a combat radius of more than 500
nautical miles.
Future Effects of the Atom Bomb
One way or another the atom bomb
threatens to affect future generations.
Prospective parents exposed to radiation,
if they survive at all, may produce chil-
dren whose characteristics are directly at-
tributable to the bomb.
Now, after examining more than
60,000 pregnancies in Hiroshima and Na-
gasaki, investigators of the Atomic Bomb
Casualty Commission (ABCC) have come
up with their first report on this problem.
As published in the November 6 is-
sue of Science magazine, the report indi-
cates that: "Whatever the total effects of
radiation may be (and there is every rea-
son to believe that they are much greater
than can be detected in studies of this
type), the public health hazard in the
first generation offspring of exposed par-
ents appears to be slight."
Two of the senior authors of the report,
which covers the period 1948-1952, are
Doctors James V. Neel and William J.
Schull of the University of Michigan's
Institute of Human Biology. Dr. Neel is
an associate professor of internal medi-
cine in the U-M Medical School, while
Dr. Schull is an instructor in the Depart-
ment of Zoology.
The ABCC is a field agency of the
Committee on Atomic Energy of the
National Academy of Science, under con-
tract with the U. S. Atomic Energy Com-
mission.
Seeking to determine whether the man-
ner in which pregnancy terminates and
the characteristics of the child can be re-
lated to the exposure of his parents to
radiation, the ABCC studied 95 per cent
of all the births during the five-year
period.
Although it has discovered that there is
no significant relationship between heavy
and light exposure of either parent to
radiation and such conditions as stillbirth,
major malformation, weight of live-
births, and death during the first nine
months, the report revealed that:
"Children of heavily exposed and non-
exposed differ significantly with regard to
birth weight and frequency of stillbirths."
Children of heavily exposed fathers are
found to be, contrary to expectation, sig-
nificantly heavier than the children of
non-exposed fathers.
The stillbirth rate of heavily exposed
mothers was higher than that of non-ex-
posed mothers.

ENGINEERING DESIGNS
DEPEND ON COST
With more and more emphasis being
placed on cost of manufacture to meet
competition, industry's management
today looks to its engineers to initiate
money-saving ideas in product de-
signs. As a result, the alert engineer-
ing student who can come up with
unique money-saving suggestions in
his designs will find greater acceptance
for his suggestions and a promising
future in personal advancement and
income.
Often too little attention is devoted
to how a product design can be sim-
plified to eliminate costly manufac-
turing manhours once a basic design
is established. To achieve this end,
where designers reappraise product
details for welded steel construction,
production costs are being cut an
average of 50% compared with man-
ufacture using castings.
The reasons for the lower cost with
welded design are basic ... lower cost
of steel per pound, fewer pounds of
steel needed and simpler shop pro-
cedures. In addition, steel designs are
stronger ... resist fracture from shock
. . . are more modern in appearance.

were 1.377 per cent fewer male children

Meteor Camera
Photographic film molded almost into
the shape of a bowl is one of the operat-
ing secrets of a highly efficient new meteor
camera being used by Harvard College
Observatory. A new 5,000-pound camera
of this type near Las Cruces, New Mexico,
photographed 56 meteors in a period
when an older camera caught only one.
The meteors, mostly fragments of minor
planets or comets, are being photograph-
ed by Harvard scientists on special mold-
ed Kodak film as part of a sky survey.
The telescope-camera is being used by
Harvard astronomers on a Navy project
to learn more about the earth's upper
atmosphere. Because meteors perform like
bullets and other projectiles, the studies
are expected to prove useful to the armed
forces in high-altitude rocket experiments.
In 1947 Harvard began experiments on
the design of a new Super-Schmidt tele-
scope-camera on a contract with the U. S.
Navy Bureau of Ordnance. They consult-
ed Kodak Research Laboratories on the
film problems involved. Unique design
of the instrument manufactured by Per-
kin-Elmer Corporation of Norwalk, Con-
necticut, required a curved field to provide
the fastest possible speed. Special shaped
film was needed to accurately record the
tracks of meteors as they race through the
sky.
Kodak emulsion research scientists and
engineers in the company's manufacturing
experiments division tackled the problem.
They soon learned they had a puzzle on
their hands.

Wm W. Kinsley, M.S. in M.E., Penn. State 1949 (left), production supervisor
in Du Pont textile fiber plant, is introduced to new operator by foreman.
Keeping production rolling in a mod-
em industrial plant is a job that ap-
peals to men trained in many
branches of science and engineering.
If you are looking for opportunities
in this field, you won't have to look
far at Du Pont, where more than
1,500 members of the technical staff
are engaged in production supervi-
sion.
To qualify, a man must be able to
understand both the mechanical and
chemical phases of production. In
addition, he should be a good planner
and, above all, have a knack for work-
ing with others.
Production supervisors are respon-
sible for care of plant facilities, sup-
ply of raw materials, supervision of
operation and maintenance, cost and
shipment of finished products, as well
as personnel relations, training and
safety.
Since Du Pont makes over 1,200
products and product lines, it can
offer many opportunities in a wide
variety of operations to men inter-
ested in production supervision. In
Du Pont's Organic Chemicals Depart-
ment, forexample, most technical men
start in plant development groups,
where they gain a background in both
the technical and economic aspects
of manufacture. Those with interests
and abilities in production may then
transfer to that field to acquire fur-
ther, and more detailed, experience.
Advancement leads to jobs as Build-
ing Supervisor, Senior and Chief Su-
pervisors, and Superintendent.
The responsibilities of these super-
visory levels vary, depending upon

the men, the operation, and the prod-
ucts.
For example, in manufacturing
dyes, up to 50 different operations
may be carried out. Production and
maintenance must be carefully
planned and scheduled so that all
needs for finished product are met.
Temperature, pressure, and quality
of reactants must be carefully con-
trolled to insure that each batch of
dye will match previous batches ex-
actly.
In making each color, from 6 to 10
different unit processes may be called
upon. And, in the course of time, all
the unit operations known to chemi-
cal engineering come into play. Obvi-
ously, production supervisors have
excellent opportunities to use and ex-
pand their technical knowledge and
ingenuity. Equally important, they
can acquire background and varied
experience that prepare them for ad-
vancement to responsible positions
in management and administration.

Coating emulsion on pre-molded glass
base was possible, but prohibitively ex-
pensive, so molding sensitized film seem-
ed to be the answer. But good molding
conditions demanded high temperatures
anl long molding time—on the other
hand, low temperatures were required to
preserve the delicate film emulsion, and a
short molding period was needed to pre-
vent film fogging.
The problem was solved by compro-
mise. Test molds were made to determine
the highest temperatures and longest
molding time that could be used without
damage to the sensitive photographic film.
Then experimental equipment was devis-
ed with provisions for rapid heating and
cooling of the mold.
Samples of shaped film were sent to
Harvard for testing. They proved satisfac-
tory, and after making minor changes.
Kodak turned over molding data and
equipment plans to Harvard Observatory.
Later use of similar equipment at Harvard
suggested major improvements which

engineers located all over the world, in-
cluding Korea.
From this outline it can be seen that a
corps of specialists, each trained in a par-
ticular phase of the program, is necessary
for any fast-moving manufacturing or-
ganization to keep abreast of its competi-
tion. I would like to observe that while I
have outlined the specific organization of
the Sperry Gyroscope Company, most
manufacturing organizations, to a greater
or lesser degree, operate along the same
general principles. I am sure, therefore,
that the following observations apply in a
general way to almost any successful de-
velopment-manufacturing organization.
Criteria of the Effective Engineer
I think I can best illustrate some of the
personal and nontechnical requirements
of the science graduate if I outline the
steps taken about a year ago in selecting
the top organization for a new plant
which is being built and will be operated
to produce guided missiles for the United
States Navy.
Because we follow a policy of promot-
ing from within, we decided to search
among our Great Neck employees to find
the top personnel we required. Having
found candidates with the proper techni-
cal qualifications, our effort then was to
survey these candidates from the view-
point of their personal characteristics
which would insure the successful
operation of a remotely-located com-
pany. These characteristics that we were
looking for—characteristics that would
make or break a project—are also charac-
teristics which generally are found in
good students in college and are found
in good citizens in our local communities
and throughout our country.
The foremost characteristic that we like
in our engineers and other technical em-
ployees is a high degree of personal in-
tegrity. Since the final product of an
engineer's efforts usually results in the ex-
penditure of a great deal of money and
the time of other people, the engineer
must be very jealous of his reputation for
the accuracy of his reports and the sound-
ness of his recommendations. He must
also realize that many of his recommenda-
tions are made to and must be accepted by
non-technical personnel. All through the
various phases of a project there are mile-
stones by which the integrity of the tech-
nical man is measured. First, we want
to know as soon as possible from the re-
I'Continued from page 11)
search man, should his approach turn out
to be wrong or relatively unfavorable,
that this is the case and that it should be
abandoned in favor of a new approach.
Second, when a product is in produc-
tion, if it is found there is some-
thing wrong with the method of manu-
facture, we need to know immediately so
that changes can be made in order for
production to continue. Third, if the engi-
neer has knowledge that difficulties may
show up later in its functional operation
in the field, it is imperative that he inform
his superior immediately so that ship-
ments may be stopped to save the later
expense of service men correcting faults
in the field.
Under the pressure of time, when prob-
lems seem to multiply faster than the an-
swers, we look for the scientific man who
can come forward with honest answers—
the man who can be objective about him-
self and his project. It is that man whom
we think of first when promotions are in
order.
Since the research programs are the life
blood of most manufacturing organiza-
tions and a great deal of money is spent
on them, healthy curiosity is a quality
which we hope to find in all our technical
personnel. We find too often, however,
that the engineer's curiosity is misdirected
into spending valuable time proving that
something cannot be done instead of using
that time in search of a new solution to
the problem. Nearly everyone has heard
the story of the aerordynamics engineer
who proved that the bee was so construct-
ed that aerodynamically it could not fly.
Fortunately for the bee it does not have
the scientific training to understand the
principles of aerodynamics and goes about
its daily business with no concern for the
engineer's conclusion.
While we expect our employees to re-
spect established authority, we welcome
a reasonable amount of constructive skep-
ticism and curiosity.
More and more, as the world becomes
more complex and we tend to become
more specialized, we find a need for de-
pendence one upon the other. It is this
quality of dependability which we find
absolutely necessary in a technical man.
The engineer who can be depended upon
to carry out his assigned responsibilities is
the one that management is going to lean
on. Furthermore, he is the engineer who
most quickly attains management status.
Sometimes the technical man, instead of
coming through with his part of the pro-
gram in the time alloted, is apt to be
critical of the other departments of a
company and the way in which they are
handling their assigned responsibilities. It
is essential that the technical man recog-
nize the major part he plays in the pro-
grams of a large organization and, conse-
quently, the importance of accepting his
personal responsibility for coming
through with proper technical informa-
tion within the scheduled time. He must
learn to evaluate the magnitude of his
task and convert this evaluation into real-
istic dates, and then so organize his duties
that these dates will be met.
While the technical man plays this
major part in his company's programs,
he must have another characteristic—
that of humility. The scientist must real-
ize that while industry bases its major ad-
vances on the result of his successful
achievements, other people also make
contributions that are equally necessary to
the actual realization of this progress.
Too often young engineers feel that the
minor chores of a technical job are be-
neath their dignity and not worthy of
their college training. They expect to
prove their true worth quickly and on
some major enterprise. Too often they are
apt to minimize the value of the experi-
ence of those about them. While older
people may not have had as much techni-
cal training, they have had valuable years
of experience which they are happy to
pass on to the young scientist, if he is
receptive. In industry, the spirit and effec-
tiveness with which an employee tackles
his first humble tasks are watched very
closely, and many times influence his en-
tire career.
Industry today also needs loyalty, and
to us this faithfulness to a supervisor, to
other employees, and to the company.
This sounds simple enough, but life in a
sizable, modern, industrial organization is
sufficiently complex so that it may be
difficult for the technical man to see it
clearly. He must understand that above
everything else he is working for his
supervisor, that he can best serve all his
interests—his company, his department,
his family, and himself—by working for
and through his supervisor. It is not un-
common for young engineers, in their zeal
to get things done, to ignore the supervi-
sor or attempt to run around the end.

design precision into machine
does 98 operations a minute
In designing a machine that performs 98 fac-
ing operations every 1.1 minutes, machine tool
engineers had to be sure of extreme precision
in spindle shafts. Spindles had to be held rigid
to eliminate vibration and chatter. Engineers
solved this problem by mounting all spindle
shafts on Timken' tapered roller bearings.
How TIMKEN bearings
hold spindle rigid
The line contact between rollers and races of
Timken bearings gives spindles wide, rigid sup-
port. Deflection is minimized and end-play elim-
inated because the tapered construction of Timken
bearings enables them to take radial and thrust
loads in any combination. Spindles are held rigid
for long-lasting accuracy.

Two of the huge, 5000-pound meteor
cameras are located at Harvard's meteor
stations near Las Cruces, New Mexico.
Now being operated under contract with
the Office of Naval Research, they serve
as the main instrument in Harvard's pho-
tographic meteor program which has
been in progress since 1936.
Possibly the best demonstration of the
usefulness of these cameras for photog-
raphy of meteors is the performance of
the first camera while it was operating on
the same sky region with one of the
earlier "meteor" cameras, according to Dr.
Fred Whipple, director of the meteor
program. During this period the Super-
Schmidt photographed 56 meteors. Only
one of these was caught by the older
camera.
Meteors, mostly fragments broken off
minor planets or comets, and sometimes
no larger than buckshot, are being photo-
graphed by the Harvard scientists as a
part of their sky survey. The cameras are
extremely fast (f/0.67), with a wide
enough field to cover an area 10,000
times the size of the moon at one time.

The first submarine installation of a pipe-type
Cable System was reCently installed under the Hudson River
at Poughkeepsie, N.Y Three cables, each nearly %-miles long,
were simultaneously pulled into a six-inch welded steel pipe laid
across the river bottom. The pipe was then filled with oil main-
tamed at 200 lbs. pressure, enabling a 110,000-volt power circuit

This kind of system is called Oilostatic- a design which has long
been first choice among utilities for handling large blocks of power
by means of a high-pressure pipe-type cable system. Increased cir-
cuit reliability and savings on installation and maintenance costs
are realized.

some difficulty, they find that such tactics
cannot be tolerated in a large organiza-
tion. When a supervisor has the loyalty
of his employees, it is possible for him to
create an atmosphere of confidence and
stability, and in such an atmosphere em-
ployees can and will do their best.
This leads to cooperation. Because of
the specializations that I have outlined
previously, many engineers today work
on one project. We have some technical
projects on which are working several
hundred engineers, having several types
of specialized training. On such a project
the individual effort of each man must be
coordinated with the other members of
the team. Working together this way, it is
very important that the individual engi-
neer shows a high degree of tolerance
and acceptance of the other man's point
of view. He must learn to appreciate the
good qualities rather than the shortcom-
ings of the other members of the group.
He must learn to keep his arguments ob-
jective, leaving out personalities as much
as possible. He must know how to get
along. Once a decision is made he must
(Continued from page 46)
go along with the rest of the team and
carry out his assignment to the best of
his ability. It is expected when a man ac-
cepts a position in industry, that he be-
comes personally associated with the name
and reputation of his company. He should
not feel it necessary that he understand
and agree with every policy and proce-
dure to which he must conform.
Finally, we like our technical people to
be enthusiastic. As we all know, people
with enthusiasm are easy to work with.
They make the daily routine jobs more
pleasant and interesting, and job progress
is faster. Nothing brings success to a
project more than having an enthusiastic
group working together.
The Educator's Role
All educators agree, I am sure, that
teaching would be more pleasant and
much more effective if these qualities ex-
isted in their students. It is true that
much of the character of an individual
has been built by the time he reaches
college. But the college student, by his
very nature, is still anxious to learn

those things offered him at college. Dur-
ing this time the faculty member creates
a profound and lasting impression on his
students, and the college staff can still
do a great deal to supplement and turn
into mature conviction the earlier good
training of the students. Once a man
finishes school and is employed, he is
placed in a situation where it becomes
still more difficult for him to develop
these qualities of character which are then
acquired mainly through association or
through bitter experience. If our technical
college faculties can prepare the student
at this yet formative stage, so that these
characteristics in fact become a part of his
character, then our job in industry will
be done more successfully, and the man's
advancement will be that much more
rapid.
Above all else, I would like to impress
these thoughts on professors and instruc-
tors. If, in some small way, they can pass
on to the student the fact that his ad-
vancement in life, including his earning
power, will really be affected by these
qualities, he will be helped immeasurably.
If in the classroom, there is a student who
is arrogant or who will not cooperate, try
to get across to him that arrogance and
unwillingness to cooperate will surely
handicap him later in life. When there is
a student who shows a lack of integrity
by copying and handing in papers prepar-
ed by someone else, explain to him that
in life he cannot long get away with
cheating. Build up a feeling of enthusiasm
in the student; it will stand him in good
stead. When a student is not dependable
or loyal, please point out that dependa-
bility and loyalty pay off in more rapid
advancement and in personal happiness.
Conclusion
In summary, industry expects the en-
gineering and other technical schools in
our universities and colleges to produce
well-trained technical personnel. But
more than that, it hopes that these grad-
uates will have a high degree of personal
integrity and dependability; that they will
also have curiosity and enthusiasm, humil-
ity and loyalty, and that they will know-
how to cooperate. The opportunities and
responsibilities of the faculties of our col-
leges and universities are great, and it is
to them that industry looks for the final
shaping of the students' technical and
personal characteristics that will make
for a secure America.

Metallurgical engineering has been taught at Michigan since 1875. In the early years it was
largely concerned with the extraction of metals from their ores, but since the turn of the
century, the science of Metallurgy has developed rapidly, and the field now includes the in-
telligent alloying and processing of the metals and alloys to develop optimum mechanical
properties and resistance to corrosion and oxidation.
New and interesting developments are occurring constantly with metals heretofore unavail-
able for commercial use, as in the field of atomic energy and the increasing knowledge of the
properties of Titanium, Beryllium, and Zirconium.
Metallurgical engineering find their places in many industries other than those involving the
production of metals and alloys. Among these may be mentioned the utilities, automobile,
and aircraft production. Also, the chemical industries, domestic appliances, indeed any in-
dustry involving the use of metals.
Heat treatment is an important tool of the metallurgical engineer, and the picture shown is a
view of the furnace laboratory in the East Engineering Building.

OVERSPECIALIZATION
The greatest of benefits to be derived from a pur-
poseful college education are an active and lasting
intellectual curiosity—a pervading spirit of inquiry—
and the ability to think. To attain these goals the
student should direct his education in a broad field of
study rather than ormpecialize in a single subject.
With the increased complexity and volume of sub-
ject matter some degree of specialization is necessary.
That is the reason for the existence of colleges of engi-
neering, law, liberal arts, etc. But specialization
within a college can be carried too far with the result
of destroying the purpose of a college education.
There are numerous reasons for discouraging over-
specialization in undergraduate schools, the most im-
portant being that it limits one's education. In college
the student is taught the ideas and principles that
have and are influencing man's environment. It is
hoped with this training he will be able to better
understand his surroundings, and that he will be able
to draw upon his acquired knowledge to predict situa-
tions and happenings yet to come. To overspecialize
one must restrict himself to his specialization and de-
prive his mind from probing the vast amount of
knowledge that man's mind is capable of exploring.
The four years which the student usually devotes'
to undergraduate work are not enough to give him a
general education and a specialized training. It is
highly improbable for one to become a specialist in
any field of higher learning in just four years. If
overspecialization is pursued it will not mean that the
student will become an authority in any field, rather
it will indicate that he will not be trained in anything
outside his specialization. Whereas over specializa-
tion purports to give an intensified education in some
chosen field, what it actually does is to inhibit one's
education outside his specialty.
The desire to overspecialize is more tempting in
engineering schools than in other colleges. This is
perhaps for two reasons. One is that engineering
schools are supposed to give the student not only an
intellectual education but also a vocational one. The
second reason is the prevalent view that engineering
is such a complex field that only by specialization can
anyone hope to master any phase of it. Both of these
are valid reasons; but engineering is a growing, pio-
neering, creative field and it can be mastered only
after one has been taught the basic engineering prin-
ciples and after one's mind has been trained to take
these principles and other incomplete data and arrive
at some solution or conclusion.
A look about us will reveal immediately that every
successful person is a specialist of some kind. So the
question still remains what can the student do to re-
ceive a specialized training. There are two things he
can do: continue his education in graduate school or
become a specialist by experience.
Undergraduate schools should not be expected to
accomplish what graduate schools and many long
years of experience are able to do. College should be
looked upon as a stage in the student's preparation
for further study and for a meaningful participation
in society.
Lately there has been a gradual shifting toward
overspecialization in many colleges. But if the limita-
tions and drawbacks of such a tendency is realized, it
will be seen that overspecialization in undergraduate
schools is undesirable.

JAMES L. SNEDIKER, '55 I.E.
I wish to express my sincere apprecia-
tion to Mr. F. D. Ross, General Manager
of The Factory Insurance Association of
Hartford, Connecticut, for the use of the
material and photographs included in a
report by his association regarding the
General Motors Corporation fire in
Livonia, Michigan, August 12, 1953.
This loss is the largest in a single plant
in the history of this country. It occurred
in a risk that had been classified as having
non-combustible construction and gener-
ally non-combustible contents. Because of
the size of the loss there are many les-
sons to be learned from it.
This plant at Livonia, Michigan, a few
miles west of Detroit—a vital unit of
General Motors Corporation—was en-
gaged in the manufacture of automatic
transmissions, known as "Hydra-matic,"
which are used in their own and other
makes of automobiles. There was no other
plant immediately available for the pro-
duction of this type of transmission.
The plant was a large, mainly one-
story, structure with limited two-story
areas, having a total floor area of ap-
proximately 1,575,000 sq. ft. While the
walls were essentially steel with brick and
glass in steel filling above, a small portion
of the rear wall was of temporary con-
struction composed of hollow concrete
block with steel sash in contemplation of
future expansion.
The floor was of concrete, overlaid
with creosoted wood block, laid in tar.
There were no basements or tunnels under
the building.
Insulated steel deck construction sup-
ported on bare steel girders, steel trusses
and steel columns were used for the roof.
Beams were 8 ft. of center, trusses 20 ft
apart and columns located 40 ft. to 48 ft.
on centers.
The roof covering consisted of layers
of tar paper and fibre glass insulation in
six of the seven units (fibre board insula-
tion in 20% of the seventh) mopped
with tar.
The specifications called for asphalt
pitch employed in the mopping to have a
melting point of not less than 200 degrees
F. and to weigh not less than 30 lbs. per
hundred sq. ft. of roof surface. It is esti-
mated that the weight of tar, asphalt and
James L. Snediker
pitch in the roof was in excess of 2000
tons.
Except for the narrow high bay section
that runs the length of the building along
the west side and the limited office areas,
the entire roof was unbroken and con-
tinuous. It can be described as a flat roof
without monitors and, therefore, without
means of providing natural smoke vent-
ing or quick access for fire fighting from
the roof area.
Quench oil was used in several well-
scattered heat treat departments. The
quench oil tanks were comparatively small
in size, not exceeding 20 sq. ft. on the
surface. Adequate supply of first aid fire
equipment was provided and generally
well arranged. The roof and roof trusses
over oil quenching and flame hardening
operations were exposed to oil condensate
including the area immediately west of
the origin of the fire. Here the condensate
was quite heavy both under the roof and
on top of the roof, the latter resulting
from oil dropping from exhaust stacks
from the flame hardening quenching ma-
chines, which caused saturation of the
roof covering for an area of about 30 ft.
by 40 ft. Work to correct this condition
had been started.
Approximately 20% of the plant was
sprinklered, covering areas principally
along the east and west walls, over re-
ceiving and shipping areas and in a few
small areas in the center of the plant.
(See drawing 1)
The factory was without fire walls and
constituted one large open fire area in
the main one-story portion. Except for
continuity of roof covering, the vertical
and horizontal supports of each of the
seven units were independent of the ad-
jacent units. The first unit was built in
1949 and the last unit was completed in
1953.
In a plant of this size the use of cutting
and welding equipment is frequent and
the fact that the plant was in continued
growth resulted in additional welding by
outside contractors. While it was intended
to provide reasonable supervision, it de-
veloped that due to the frequency and ex-
tent of welding operations and the in-
ability of fire preventive personnel to give
each job proper attention, the control pro-
gram was not adequate.
There were 20 hydrants well distribut-
ed around the plant, satisfactorily equip-
ped with hose and other proper equip-
ment.
Water for both sprinklers and hydrants
came from a 200,000 gallon elevated
gravity tank on a 100 ft tower—100,000
gallons reserved for fire. In addition there
was a 10" connection from a 12" city
main with two 4000 g.p.m. electric cen-
trifugal pumps serving both mill and fire
protection systems.
The public water supply serving this
plant is considered adequate in volume.
The City of Livonia has a part paid and
part volunteer fire department, with a
chief; fire fighting equipment is located
in three stations. There are no municipal
fire alarm boxes and all alarms are trans-
mitted by telephone. The adjoining muni-
cipalities work under a Mutual Aid Sys-
tem so that assistance can be drawn as
needed.
A fire brigade on all shifts, with a fire
chief during the day, was maintained at
the plant.
First aid protection was adequate from
chemical extinguishers of carbon dioxide,
foam, and carbon tetrachloride units in-
cluding large hand wheeled dry powder
units. There were also several 1^"

the buildings and on the roof supplied
from overhead sprinkler lines.
The area in which the fire originated
(see Photo 2) was used for rust-proofing
of metal castings and located in the south-
east corner of Unit No. 1. The rust-
proofing consisted of hanging stock on a
monorail conveyor passing through rust
preventing liquid known as "Rust-Ban"
in a dip tank of 450 gallons capacity.
"Rust-Ban" has the characteristics of a
light oil of lanolin mixture, the flash
point of which was specified to have been
not less than 100 degrees F. On test,
however, it was found to have a flash
point of 97.7 degrees F. The conveyor
as well as a small portion of the adjoining
drip pan, was protected by an automatic
100 lb. carbon dioxide gas extinguishing
system. This unit was tested satisfactorily
on May 15, 1953.
On the day of the fire, welding opera-
tions were being conducted by an outside
contractor. This work was conducted in
the 4 foot aisle between the rust-proofing
conveyor equipment and the hollow con-
crete block partition separating the Tern-
stedt Division. There were four men as-
signed to this welding job; one as a fire
watcher, the second as a fire watcher and
ladder safety man, and two men were on
ladders doing the welding. In the morn-
ing, welding was done approximately 72

serving the tank was 125 ft. in length
and under it for its entire length, except
at the dip tank, was a 2 ft. wide drip pan
having a 2" lip on either side. The con-
veyor was carried at an elevation of 14
ft. above the floor and the drip pan was
3' 4" below the conveyor, thus placing it
well above a person's head. The area
immediately to the west of the rust-proof-
ing operation was devoted to machining
and flame hardening, which involved the
use of quenching oils. This entire area
was heavily concentrated with machinery
and the operations resulted in the deposit
on the ceiling of oil and dust residue. A
number of chemical extinguishers, both
hand and wheeled type, served this area,
as well as small hose lines. The dip tank,
ft. north of the dip tank with a gas weld-
ing torch. A 20 ft. by 15 ft. canvas tar-
paulin (not flame-proofed) was said to be
hung from the roof truss between the con-
veyor drip pan and the welding operator.
The actual position of the welding opera-
tion was approximately 3 to 4 feet higher
than the drip pan.
In the afternoon, the gas welding
equipment was moved to a position ap-
proximately 12 ft. southeast of the rust-
proofing dip tank and cutting was done
with the same number of men involved.
It is stated that the 20 ft. by 15 ft.
tarpaulin had been hung in a position to
prevent sparks entering the dip tank or
the drip pan. However, ashes of the tar-
paulin found following the fire would in-
dicate that this tarpaulin had not been
moved to this location.
The time was approximately 3:50 p.m.,
the department was in full operation, and
the "Rust-Ban" 'conveyor was operating.
The actual distance from the welder to
the exposed drip pan was approximately
8 feet.
The fire was caused by welding sparks
igniting the residue in the drip pan, and
was first noticed by the welding watcher.
He immediately shouted "Fire!" and
reached for the nearby 20 lb. carbon diox-
ide extinguisher. Employees joined in the
fight against the fire with other carbon
dioxide extinguishers including 150 lb.
dry powder extinguishers on wheels. Since
the fire was approximately 11 feet above
the floor, some difficulty was experienced
in reaching the seat of the fire.
Other extinguishers were brought into
action, some from ladders, and the fire
was prevented from reaching the rust-
proof tank, the carbon dioxide extinguish-
ing system of which had been set off by
the heat. Soon the drip pan began to
buckle and fire dropped onto the floor.
Then the oil condensate on the under-
side of the roof also became ignited. This
spread of fire and heat also caused burn-
ing of rubber covered power cables
which was accompanied by electric arcing
followed by opening of breakers and the
loss of light and power. By this time mol-
ten asphalt from the composition built-up
roof covering had started to seep through
and drip from the points of the metal
deck roof into the darkened and smoke
filled areas. All of this took place within
a period of approximately ten minutes.
The Livonia Fire Department received
notice of the fire at 3:56 p.m. but upon
arrival at the plant the smoke was so
dense that access to the plant was practi-
cally impossible. Their first efforts were
directed to removing employees from the
building, several of whom were trapped
by smoke in the second floor office.
Promptly thereafter they, together with
other responding public fire departments,
stationed themselves around the outside
of the plant where their hose streams
could reach only a distance of 50 to 75
ft. The building was 866 ft. wide, thus
leaving the center of the building, where
the fire actually was in progress, untouch-
ed by public fire department hose streams.
This structure did not have monitors or
other channels through which smoke and
heat could be vented outdoors and the
dense black smoke quickly enveloped a
very large area driving the personnel in

E. WENDELL HEWSON
Lecturer in Meteorology and Research Physicist,
Engineering Research Institute
The development of meteorology as a
science and as a profession in the United
States may for convenience be divided
into three phases. The first phase, carry-
ing us up to «about the year 1930, was
marked by an emphasis on the immediate
and practical problems of forecasting the
weather in response to public demand.
The U. S. Weather Bureau shouldered the
load almost single handed during that
period. The establishment of the Ameri-
can Meteorological Society in 1920 was
one of the earlier indications of a new
trend.
By 1930 an interest in obtaining a more
basic understanding of atmospheric proc-
esses was becoming pronounced. Univer-
sity teaching and research in meteorology
began to receive more attention and the
rapidly developing commercial airlines re-
quired new types of weather information.
This second phase ended with World War
II, with its sudden and great demand for
weather services and personnel. We are
still in the third phase, which commenced
about 1945 with the reorganization of the
American Meteorological Society as a pro-
fessional society and the establishment of
a professional membership based on edu-
cational qualifications and a code of ethics.
Greatly increased services to industry, both
by the Weather Bureau and by private
consultants, have featured this period.
The applications of meteorology to hu-
man affairs are many, and new ones are
being continually developed. The main-
tenance of acceptable standards of at-
mospheric purity has received much atten-
tion, as indicated in the article "Atmos-
pheric Sanitation" by Professors Sherlock
and Lesher in this issue of the Technic.
Another type of problem in this area of
engineering was met by the writer when
employed as a consultant to the Consoli-
dated Mining and Smelting Company of
Canada, Ltd., Trail, B.C. Acting under
the authority of the International Trail
Smelter Arbitral Tribunal, an operating
regime was established which limited the
sulfur dioxide output of the smelter in
accordance with objective measured
meteorological criteria. Similar control
methods have been adopted by other large
E. Wendell Hewson
plants where the processes are such as to
permit such a solution. Meteorology may
be applied to the problems of atmospheric
sanitation in a number of other ways.
Because weather and climate affect
man's activities at so many points, the
opportunities for applying meteorology
are very great. Many of these areas of ap-
plication, but by no means all, lie in the
field of engineering. A few illustrative ex-
amples are given below.
Load big of Struct tires by Wind, Snow,
and Ice. By 1930, as indicated above, an
increased interest in understanding the
atmosphere arose. One source of this in-
terest was the realization in some engi-
neering circles that much was to be gained
by working with, rather than against,
weather and climate. For example, a very
comprehensive and detailed investigation
of the wind forces acting on the poles and
conductors of a power line was com-
menced in 1928 by the University of
Michigan at a site not far from Ann
Arbor. The project was supported by the
Edison Electric Institute, and the research
carried out by Professor R. H. Sherlock,
M. B. Stout, W. G. Dow, P. O. Huss,
J. S. Gault, and R. S. Swinton.
An experimental power line thirteen
hundred feet long was built and the con-
ductors given a special covering to simu-
late ice loading. Instruments were de-
veloped to measure the forces bending the
poles, the tensions and transverse forces
in the conductors, and the wind velocity
at three points along the line. A new type
of rapid response pressure-plate anemo-
meter was designed, and five of them
were mounted on a steel tower 250 feet
high. They were also mounted at the top
of an array of twelve poles each 50 feet
high and spaced 60 feet apart. Both ver-
tical and horizontal cross sections of pass-
ing gusts were obtained and much valu-
able information found from these and
from the other related observations. The
accompanying photograph shows details
of the installation. This investigation still
stands as the most comprehensive one of
its type which has yet been made.
The dynamic loading of structures by
turbulent winds still presents many prob-
lems in applied meteorology. Not only are
buildings and stacks involved, but TV
antenna towers and suspension bridges,
for example, as well. Winds have been a
major problem in suspension bridge de-
sign, ten such bridges having suffered
major damage or have collapsed in wind
storms between 1818 and 1889. Five of
these were in Great Britain, three in the
United States, and one each in France
and Germany. On 7 November 1940 a
major failure occurred when the Tacoma
Narrows Bridge, with a span of 2800
feet, went down in a storm under the
action of a wind averaging about 42
m.p.h. Studies are revealing how such
failures may be avoided.
The establishment of realistic design
live loads for roofs in various sections of
the country is another phase of meteoro-
logical engineering. Not only are very
detailed dimatological studies of precipi-
tation, particularly snowfall, required but
winds must be considered as well. Where
a heavy snow load is already present, even
on a horizontal roof, downward moving
gusts may impose a dynamic loading
which leads to failure. Supercooled rain
which freezes on impact is an additional

One of the penalties which must be
paid for living in the industrial age is
the nuisance and hazard of breathing con-
taminants which have been emitted by
industries into the air. All contaminants
in the air are not the result of industrial
activities, and it is probably true that there
is no place near the surface of the earth
where contaminants are wholly absent.
The expression "country fresh air" may
be highly misleading. For example, the
air near the ocean contains damaging
amounts of salt particles; there are the
dust storms of the plain states and the
sand storms of the desert; which have oc-
curred occasionally for countless ages;
there are dusts, fumes, and gases dis-
charged by volcanoes, sometimes in huge
quantities; and vegetation gives off spores
and pollen to plague mankind. But we
know from laws enacted to control atmo-
spheric pollution that industry has been
the cause of considerable atmospheric con-
tamination for at least 700 years. Indus-
trial gases, fumes, dusts, vapors, etc., can
be harmful to crops of many kinds, and to
animals which feed upon them. Interest
in this subject has become so great in the
last few years that the expression "atmo-
spheric pollution" is frequently heard,
and is sometimes bandied about by people
who have nothing to contribute in the
matter but are merely seeking publicity.
We prefer to use the expression "atmo-
spheric sanitation" because, from long
usage the word sanitation has come to
imply a willingness and a competence to
do something about an undesirable sit-
uation.
During previous generations smoke was
the most common form of contaminant
emitted by industries. But smoke is un-
burned particles of carbon and represents
an economic loss, so that in most large
industries very little smoke is emitted
from the stacks. But there are other ob-
noxious constituents of combustion which
emerge from the stacks and are the cause
of nuisance and hazard if they reach the
ground in sufficiently strong concentra-
tions. In this article we shall say nothing
about the settling of particulate matter but
will confine outselves to the description
of measures which may be taken to pre-
vent gaseous wastes from reaching the
ground in strong concentrations.
Studies to determine the laws of be-
havior of stack gases as they flow down-
wind, and to prevent downwash of these
gases, have been in progress at the Uni-
versity of Michigan since March, 1934,
when a project in this field was sponsored
by the Commonwealth Edison Companv
of Chicago. That pioneer project was
connected with one of the large generating
stations and was followed during later
years by other studies dealing with the
extension of old plants and the design of

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Under favorable weather conditions the
plume from a smoke stack will rise grad-
ually as it flows downwind and the gases
will be dispersed until only a negligible
concentration prevails in the atmosphere.
Under such conditions the gases do not
become a cause of annoyance to people on
the ground. Unfortunately, however, there
are several adverse natural influences
which arise occasionally to disturb this
orderly dispersion of the stack gases. For
our purposes these adverse influences will
be classified as follows:
1. Aerodynamic influences
2. Unfavorable terrain
3. Meteorological and micro-meteoro-
logical influences
4. The settling of particulate matter
As the wind flows past a plant it gen-
erates turbulence in the wake of the stacks
and of the buildings. The turbulent
masses of air immediately above and be-
hind the buildings is separated from the
smoother flowing upper layers of air by a
vortex sheath. If the bases emitted by the
stack come under the influence of the tur-
bulence generated by the stack the gases
may be brought down and penetrate the
vortex sheath so that they are brought to
the ground by the turbulence behind the
building. Under such conditions the con-
centrations of obnoxious constituents of
the gas on the ground may be very high
in the area close to the plant.
If the gas escapes the eddies at the
plant it may flow downwind and come
under the adverse influence of the terrain.
This may be in the form of hills or val-
leys which set up currents which may en-
trap the gas.
Even if the gases escape the influence
of the eddies near the plant or of the cur-
rents deflected by the hills, there are ther-
mal influences in the atmosphere which
may bring them to the ground before they
have been sufficiently dispersed. These
thermal effects cause large scale units of
wind structure and these must be super-
imposed upon the more nearly iso-topic
elements of diffusion. The subject of at-
mospheric diffusion belongs primarily in
the field of meteorology.
Correction of undesirable behavior of
gas plumes may be obtained by taking
advantage of certain favorable influences
which may be used to offset the unfavor-
able influences just enumerated. These are
(1) stack height, (2) gas velocity and
(3) gas temperature. There is a.economic
limit to the height to which stacks can be
built. Industrial stacks of a height of 250
to 300 feet are common but are considered

quite high. One group of three rein-
forced concrete stacks which is now under
construction will have a height of 680
feet above the ground. These will be the
highest in the world by a margin of al-
most 100 feet and were used in an ex-
tremely unusual situation such as is shown
in the accompanying photographs. The
flotational effect given by the temperature
of the stack gases is usually looked upon
as a margin of safety and is usually not
relied upon in design. The parameter
upon which the behavior of the gas plume
will depend in escaping adverse aero-
dynamic influences around the plant is
the ratio of the stack gas velocity to the
velocity of the wind. This can be shown
to be the ratio of the favorable momentum
of the emerging gas to the unfavorable
momentum of the passing wind.
The accompanying photographs show
models of plants undergoing study in the
wind tunnel. In each case critical velocity

Figure I. Artificial Sun.
In March of 1940 the Owens-Illinois
Glass Company initiated a program at the
University of Michigan through the Engi-
neering Research Institute for the study
of daylighting problems and the develop-
ment of light-directing fenestration ma-
terials. From that time until 1948 the
work was conducted in the Randall Lab-
oratory of Physics. In 1947 the Daylight-
ing Laboratory was built on the roof of
the East Engineering Building for the
purpose of housing the activities relating
to this work. Dr. R. A. Boyd has conduct-
ed this work from the beginning and is
now assisted by Ralph E. Knight and
Barbara C. O'Dell.
During the first years of the project
it was necessary to develop methods and
design equipment for the measurement of
the brightness and transmission of fene-
stration materials. Since the natural
sources of daylight could not be used in
the detailed measurement of brightness
and transmission because of their varia-
bility, it was necessary to design an arti-
ficial sky for measurement purposes. Fig-
ure one is a picture of the artificial sun
that is now part of the present Laboratory.
This is a 5000 watt projector equipped
with a Fresnel lense and geared to vertical
and horizontal tracks so that it can be
placed in any altitude or azimuth position
with respect to the light transmitting ma-
terial that is mounted in the near-by wall.
Figure two shows the opposite side of the
wall in which the light transmitting ma-
terial is mounted. The semi-circular hoop
is geared into the floor in order to obtain
different azimuth positions, thus a photo-
cell that moves along the hoop can be
placed in any direction with respect to the
material in the wall. Both motions of the
artificial sun and the photocell are con-
trolled by DC motors and are geared to
Selsyn Indicators so that the complete
mechanism can be controlled from the
console, which is to the left of the hoop.
Through the use of this equipment and a
large intregrating sphere it is possible to
measure the brightness and transmission
of any light-transmitting material for all
possible exterior sun conditions. Although
the Laboratory is also equipped with an
artificial sky, the transmission and bright-
ness of the various materials due to light
from various skys are determined for the
most part by calculations based upon data
collected through the use of the artificial
sun.
The work of the Laboratory has also re-
sulted in the development of a reflecto-
meter, a direct reading brightness meter,
an electronic recorder and photocells that
obey the cosine law of illumination.
The basic aim in the development of
daylighting materials has been the im-
provement of the visual environment for
the occupants of a daylighted room. Re-
search has firmly established that visual
performance is much more dependent
upon the absence of high brightness-
ratios than it is upon the quantity of il-
lumination. Therefore, the work of the
Daylighting Laboratory has been directed
toward the design of fenestration ma-
terials that will provide daylighting with
a minimum amount of glare. During the
course of the project several different
light-directing blocks have been designed;
each one showing an improvement over
the proceeding one. These blocks were
designed for use in the outside walls of a
building and provide a reduction in
brightness in the direction of the observer
and a redirection of the transmitted light
toward the ceiling and upper recesses of

the room for all exterior illumination con-
ditions.
During the past ten years these blocks
have been used extensively in the con-
struction of schools and industrial build-
ings. Their use in schools have caused a
considerable improvement in the day-
lighting of school classrooms. In order to
obtain detailed information on the day-
lighting of school classrooms, a full-sized
experimental classroom was built as a
part of the Daylighting Laboratory during
1947 and 1948. This room was flexible in
that it could be given two exposures,
south and west, and could be altered in
size. Also, as an aid to these studies it
was necessary to use models. These models
ranging in size from one-ninth scale to
one-quarter scale. In this way the distri-
bution of illumination and brightness
throughout a classroom could be studied
in detail and correlated with the bright-
ness and transmission characteristics of the
fenestration materials as obtained through
the use of artificial daylight sources.
During the past several years educa-
tional methods and the need for economy
in school construction have brought about
classrooms having larger floor areas with
lower ceiling heights. This trend has
made the adequate daylighting of the
rooms much more difficult through the use
of only light-directing block in the ex-
terior walls. At the same time the trend in
schoolhouse construction has been toward
single story structures rather than multiple
story buildings. This has made it possible
and desirable to develop a light directing
material for use in the ceiling and roof of
a classroom. The development of such a
block was completed by the Daylighting
Laboratory during 1953, and it was so de-
signed that it is selective in its transmis-
sion of direct sunlight and skylight. It
transmits a high percentage of direct win-
ter sunlight, a low percentage of direct
summer sunlight and a high percentage of
light from the north sky, thus providing
control over the transmission of direct
sunlight and solar heat during the hotter
months of the year.
In order to completely study the day-
lighting of a school classroom that is
fenestrated with light-directing glass
block in an outside wall and the light-
selecting block in the ceiling, a second
full-sized school classroom has been con-
structed on the roof adjacent to the Day-
lighting Laboratory. The two pictures
(Figures 3 and 4) show the room ar-
rangement and some of the furnishings
that have been used in its construction.
An attempt has been made to make this
classroom very modern, cheerful and suit-
able for present educational methods. The
colorful fiberglas drapes are used to cover
the main fenestration in order to darken
the room sufficiently for the projection of
slides and motion pictures. Two of the
walls consist of birch paneling and the
third wall is a light brown Mosiac tile.
The ceiling is an off-white fiberglas acous-
tical tile and the floor a mottled-green
rubber tile. The furniture is completely
flexible, as required by present classroom
procedures, is light weight and stackable.
The various companies that manufac-
ture the materials, supplies and equip-
ment, that have become a part of this
room, contribute their products to the
project free of charge.
The daylighting of this room is ex-
tremely comfortable and on an average
overcast day has an intensity equal to
about twice that usually obtained in a
classroom having a higher ceiling, a
smaller floor area and only an outside wall
fenestration.
Because of this greater quantity of
daylighting the electric lights are required
only a small percentage of each school
year to provide supplementary light on
very dark days. The electric lights are
controlled automatically and come on
when the illumination at the center of the
room drops to 30 foot-candles and go off
when the daylight again reaches a satis-
factory level.
Several hundred architects and educa-
tors have visited the room since it was
completed and they were all impressed
by the progress that has been made in the
daylighting of school classrooms and the
subsequent improvement of the aesthetics
through the use of modern materials and
equipment.

Robot Psychologist
A "robot psychologist" with an
tronic brain, memory, and "show
L-lec-
dow" viewing screen is helping human
psychologists here "see" that the right
man gets the right Army job.
The huge two-and-one-half ton,
double-section electronic computer is
known as a psychological matrix rotator.
It was developed by engineers at the Gen-
eral Electric Company's General Engineer-
ing Laboratory, Schenectady, N.Y., from
a basic design prepared by Dr. Richard
H. Gaylord, prominent Department of
Defense psychologist.
It is being used by the Personnel Re-
search and Procedures Division of the
Adjutant General's office, Washington,
D.C.
Described as so complex that only skill-
ed psychologists can operate it and under-
stand results, the machine was in plan-
ning and consideration for three years at
the Personnel Research Branch and an
additional two years in research and de-
velopment at the G-E laboratory.
George T. Jacobi, G-E analog computer
engineer, said continuous collaboration
between engineers and psychologists re-
sulted in a computer "optimally suited to
the psychologists' needs."
Psychological problems are first trans-
lated into statistical form and then fed
into the giant computer. A maze of
vacuum tubes, potentiometers, wires and
other electrical appartus literally hums
through the data and flashes results on a
cathode ray tube, similar in appearance
to a 16-inch television viewing screen.
The operating psychologist sees the test
results in the form of "scatter diagrams"
or dot patterns. Data not required during
a particular problem are stored in the
machine's electronic '"memory" for future
use.
G-E engineers say time required for
solving complex problems can be reduced
from months or even years to a matter of
days through use of the new computer.

use in a typical problem might run as
follows:
Psychologists first obtain information
to be fed the machine by administering
paper and pencil tests to various "known"
groups of people, such as doctors, truck-
drivers or mechanics. Each group is as-
sumed to have individual talents or abili-
ties as manual dexterity, shape recogni-
tion, reasoning, etc.
Information thus received is translated
into statistical form on a variety of other
computing devices and fed into the "robot
psychologist" for analyzing. A myriad
of buttons, switches and dials set the com-
puter into operation to flash test results
on the viewing screen as a pattern of dots.
The dot patterns are then studied for de-
sired information.
Dots obtained from statistical data of
"known" groups are then used as a
standard of comparison in determining

a particular job. The patterns can then be
used in mass psychological testing of new
recruits.
According to G-E engineers, the psy-
chological matrix rotator was developed
to handle statistical data representing 12
different abilities underlying up to 50
tests. However, Department of Defense
psychologists have already learned to
adapt it to much larger problems.
Test patterns arranged in closely-clus-
tered dots are assumed to describe similar
underlying or inherent abilities among
the various groups, such as both doctors
and mechanics having manual-dexterity.
Whenever a dot representing a particu-
lar test of ability is widely separated from
the cluster, the operator identifies the dot
by lighting a circular light around it.
Then by cross-checking the "robot psy-
chologist," he can tell which test or abil-
ity is under question.
Such an occurrence might indicate, for
instance, that the test under question is
not accurately representative of the clus-
tered dots. For example, a dot represent-
ing spelling ability or test might be wide-
ly separated from dots representing mathe-
matical ability, with which spelling has
little in common.
The giant computer comprises two sec-
tions. The five-by-five-by-six-foot input
cubicle contains electronic equipment for
receiving and storing statistical data. The
operator's console, approximately twice
this si2e, but stationed six feet away, con-
sists of controls for receiving information
from the input cubicle, the computing ele-
ments, the viewing screen, and a camera
for photographing "cluster" data.
At present, according to G-E engineers,
the "robot psychologist" is being used to
facilitate studies designed to improve cur-
rent methods of mass psychological test-
ing.
Atomic Eye View
A large opening, resembling an eye,
permits an inside glimpse of a gigantic
steel sphere, under construction near
Schenectady, N.Y., which will house the
prototype of an atomic power plant for
U.S. Navy submarines. The plant is be-
ing built by scientists of the Knolls
Atomic Power Laboratory, which is oper-
ated by the General Electric Company for
the Atomic Energy Commission. The
circular hole is for an air-tight entrance
lock. A similar opening for another lock
is seen on the opposite wall of the sphere.
The 400-foot tower rising through the
middle of the sphere is used for erecting
the huge, inch thick steel plates which
comprise the sphere. More than five miles
of welding was necessary to join these
plates together. When completed, this
huge Hortonsphere will weigh about 3850
tons.
More Passengers Turning to

States and Queen Elizabeth combined.
Building to Use Atomic Heat
The first American system to utilize
waste heat developed in atomic reactors
will be installed at the plutonium-produc-
ing plant at Richland, Wash., it has been
announced by private engineers operating
the project for the Atomic Energy Com-
mission.
The plan is to salvage the heat from
water used to cool the reactors. The hot
water will run through a heat exchanger
to warm water in a secondary piped circuit
without making it radio-active. The water
in the secondary circuit, enough to heat
about 1,000 average-sized houses, will
warm air drawn into several plant struc-
tures now being built. The new system
will cost about $614,000, and is expected
to save $59,000 a year in heating ex-
penses.

ing in Korea during the prisoner repatria-

How the Movies Built an International
Market for Their Films
In the early years of the motion picture
industry, stoppages and imperfections in
films were common. They were caused by
irregular perforations and perforation
spacings in the film, by non-standard mo-
tion picture machinery, and by non-stand-
ardized methods of handling film and
equipment. In 1916 the Society of Motion
Picture Engineers cited such stoppages as
a main cause for the lack of popularity of
motion pictures among large numbers of
people.
Standards have completely eliminated
these difficulties. The industry is now
highly standardized in processes, product
and procedures, not only in this country
but internationally. After the American
Standard for the location of the sound
track on 16-mm film was adopted interna-
tionally in the 1930's, many other motion
picture standards were internationalized.
The ASA Sectional Committee on Stand-
ards for Motion Pictures, PH22, made up
of 32 organizations, has developed more
than 60 American Standards, and many of
these have found world-wide acceptance.
Today, motion picture film from one
country can be projected in the standard
equipment of any other country in the
world.
Indicating thread plug gage.
Indicating Thread Plug Gage
This is an adjustable Indicating Thread
Plug Gage, the measuring unit consisting
of three measuring jaws representing
master thread gages, one of which is re-
tractable between the other two. In this
way the instrument can be inserted into
the thread to be checked without any
screwing in or out. The measuring jaws
expand under spring action and engage
the thread along its entire length. The
two fixed lower jaws center the instru-
ment in the threaded bore, whereas the
upper movable jaw transfers its move-
ment to the Indicator. After setting the
Indicator to zero with a ring gage, the
instrument can also be used for checking
smooth bores with special measuring jaws.
The measuring time is considerably shor-
tened by use of this instrument, as the
screwing in and out as with an ordinary
thread plug gage is eliminated.

National Bureau of Standards
A much clearer picture of the effect of
plating variables on the structure and
properties of electrodeposited nickel has
resulted from a comprehensive laboratory
investigation conducted over the past five
years by Victor Zentner, Abner Brenner,
and Charles Jennings of the National Bu-
reau of Standards. In the course of the
study, which was sponsored by the Ameri-
can Electroplaters' Society, cathode current
efficiencies and the internal stress of the
deposits were determined for a great
number of different bath compositions
and operating conditions, the chemical
composition and microstructure of the de-
posits were investigated, and their thermal
and mechanical properties were measured.
The results show that hardness, tensile
strength, and other properties of nickel
deposits can be varied over a wide range
by proper choice of plating bath. More-
over, it has been possible to explain this
broad variation in properties on the basis
of the physical nature of codeposited im-
purities present in small amounts.
Industrial use of nickel plating includes
a variety of application. In general, the
thinner coatings are used for ornamental
purposes or for protection against corro-
sion while the heavier deposits are applied
to machine parts, where resistance to wear
is an important factor, and used in elec-
troforming. Although quite different
properties are required in different appli-
cations, until now little information has
been available regarding the relationship
between the conditions under which the
plating is done and the resulting deposit.
The NBS investigation provides a large
amount of basic data which can now be
utilized for the consistent production of
deposits having desired properties. While
major emphasis was placed on those me-
chanical properties of the deposits which
are of immediate value in engineering ap-
plications, data were also collected on
electrical and other properties which may
be of value in determining the suitability
of nickel deposits for special applications.
In the NBS study, about 240 different
deposits were produced from 20 different
types of baths operated over a wide range
of temperature, current density, and pH.
The test specimens were obtained by de-
positing nickel on sheet or tubular ca-
thodes to a thickness of about 0.01 inch.
During the plating process, current effi-
ciencies and internal stress of the deposits
were measured. After separation from the
cathodes, the specimens were analyzed
chemically, and their structures were
studied by optical microscopy, electron
microscopy, and X-ray diffraction. They
were also tested for hardness, tensile
strength, elongation, yield strength,
Young's modulus of elasticity, fatigue
limit, internal friction, thermal expansion,
specific heat, heat of solution, electrical
resistivity, and magnetic properties. The
effects of heat treatment on many of these
properties were studied.
It was found that the most important
factor affecting the properties of the de-
posits is the type of plating solution, that
is, the nature of the anion and the pres-
ence of special additives. Although de-
posits produced at lower temperatures
were usually finer-grained than those ob-
tained at high temperatures, the effects of
variations in operating conditions, such as
temperature and current density, are in
general relatively small, provided the con-
ditions are within the satisfactory operat-
ing range for the solution used.
On the basis of the physical and me-
chanical properties of the deposits, nickel
plating baths may be classified in three
main groups: bright-nickel baths, contain-
ing organic brighteners; high-chloride
baths, containing more than 50 percent of
the nickel present as chloride; and Walls-
type baths, which contain the nickel in
the form of both sulfate and chloride in
the ratio of 3:1. In general, the extremes
in properties are shown by the bright-
nickel and the Watts-nickel deposits while
the properties of the high-chloride nickel
are intermediate between the two. The
brightnickel baths yield bright deposits
having the greatest hardness, tensile
strength, resistivity, and coercive force of
all types of nickel deposits, but they also
have the lowest ductility elongation, and
magnetic permeability. The high-chloride
baths, on the other hand, produce dull
deposits which are somewhat below bright
nickel in hardness and tensile strength
but have a higher ductility. From the
Watts-type baths are obtained dull grey
deposits. These are the purest of the three
types; they possess the lowest stress, hard-
ness, tensile strength, resistivity, and co-
ercive force and at the same time the
highest ductility, elongation, and magnetic
permeability.
The properties of the deposits were
affected very little by the concentration of
nickel in the plating solutions. However.
the effect of the chloride content of the
bath on the hardness of the deposit was
rather striking. When a bath containing
one-fourth of the nickel in the form of
chloride and the rest as sulfate was used,
a pronounced minimum in hardness of the
deposit was observed. As yet no explana-
tion for this effect has been developed.
In its influence on the mechanical prop-
erties of the deposits, the pH of the plat-
ing solution was second in importance
only to the nature of the bath constituents.
In the pH measurements, it was found
that when the pH of the bath goes above
5, the tensile strength of the deposit
rapidly rises and the ductility decreases. If
the pH of the solution is made high
enough, there is a marked increase in
hardness and tensile strength and a de-
crease in elongation. However, these ex-
treme properties are accompanied by such
a great increase in stress that the deposits
are likely to crack spontaneously or ex-
foliate.
The microstructure of the deposits was
rather closely correlated with their ob-
served properties. Thus, in micrographs
of nickel deposits from baths of varying
chloride content, the most coarse-grained
deposit had the lowest hardness. In gen-
eral, deposits with coarse-grained struc-
tures contained relatively small amounts
of impurities and were soft, ductile, and
low in tensile strength. On the other
hand, deposits with either fine-grained
structures or no visible grain structures
contained a relatively large amount of
impurities and were strong and hard but
not very ductile.
Heat treatment was found to have a
much more pronounced effect on the me-
chanical properties of bright nickel than
on those of Watts nickel. Thus, after heat
treatment at 400°C, the tensile strength
of bright nickel fell from about 200,000
lb/in2 to about 20,000 lb/in2. By contrast,
the tensile strength of Watts nickel de-
creased by only 15,000 lb/in2 from an
initial value of 75,000 lb/in2. A com-

THEY STARTED OUT EVEN AT GRADUATION:
Why is one doing better now?
You may not see it in their outward
appearances — but there's a big dif-
ference between these young men.
One has held three jobs in the five
years since graduation. He's still
looking for a job that offers him a
lifetime career. The other has been
with a Bell Telephone Company dur-
ing that time. He's on his way up!
Seventy-five per cent of college
men hired by the Bell Telephone
Companies since World War II are
still with these telephone companies
after five years/ Here's why:
Telephone Work Is Interesting — As
an engineer, you'll be planning tele-
phone facilities or supervising construc-
tion, installation and maintenance.
You'll work with the newest develop-
ments in electronics and communica-
tions as you help expand and improve
the world's best telephone service.
There Are Places to Go—Each year
the number of college people hired is
related to estimates of the number of
future management positions expected
to be available. We are looking to the
future—yours and ours.
You Grow with a Growing Business
—The Bell System is one of the fastest
growing businesses in the world. Since
the end of World War II, it has spent
about nine billion dollars for new con-
struction. The past five years have seen
the introduction of network TV trans-
mission, dialing of Long Distance calls
and the development of the remarkable
transistor.
You'll Be Happy—Not only because
of the interesting and rewarding work,
but for many other reasons. For in-
stance, Bell Telephone Companies are
located in all parts of the country. So
you may be able to start where you
want to live. And what about salaries?
It is the basic policy of the telephone
companies to pay salaries that compare
favorably with those positions of similar
responsibility in other fields.
No matter what your military
status, it's worth inquiring about
Bell System employment opportu-
nities. Your Placement Officer has
the details. And be sure to talk to

WHAT???
A traveler once stopped at a town and
went to a barber shop. As per usual, the
topics of conversation between barber and
customer ran strictly true to form until
the stranger asked the barber if he had
much competition. "None at all," replied
the barber. "Of all the men in the village,
I naturally don't shave any of those who
shave themselves, but I do shave all those
who don't shave themselves." The strang-
er grunted and lapsed into silence as the
barber proceeded with his task. A week
later the traveler was taken to an institu-
tion for the mentally sick. He would
speak to no one but himself, and he said
nothing but the following:
"Does the barber shave himself or
doesn't he?" Suppose he does. Then he
belongs to the group of men who shave
themselves. But he said that he doesn't
shave those who shave themselves, and
therefore he does not shave himself. Then
he belongs to the group of men who do
not shave themselves. But the barber said
that he shaves all those who do not shave
themselves, and therefore he does shave
himself???
A water lentil reproduces by dividing

The first expedition to Mars found only
the ruins of a civilization. From the arti-

study the explorers were able to translate
the Martian's mathematics. Upon making
one of their first literal translations they
found the following:
36X2 — 16X — 224 = 0
For which the Martian's had the solu-
tion:
45
X = -, X = -2

From this solution the explorers con-
cluded that the Martian mathematics was
different from human mathematics. They
also concluded that Martian mathematical
development was much like the human
counterpart. What is the difference be-
tween Martian and human mathematics?

fr Awards that foretell your gain
Chemicals from coal hydrogenation...
... acclaimed the 1953 Chemical Engineering Achievement!
IN 1933 Carbide received the first Chemical Engineer-
ing Achievement Award. This recognized the beginning
of commercial production of much-needed chemicals
from petroleum and natural gas—which proved to be
the beginning of the American petrochemical industry.
HISTORY REPEATS—Now, just twenty years later,
Carbide has received the 1953 Chemical Engineering
Achievement Award for "the first successful produc-
tion of chemicals from coal by a high pressure hydro-
genation process."
In minutes, coal becomes gases and liquids rich in
needed chemicals—"one of the major contributions
in this century to the well-being of us all."
Some of these chemicals are used in making plastics,
synthetic rubber, pharmaceuticals, vitamins, and many
other things. Others are completely new and hold great
promise.
FOURTH RECOGNITION —Carbide is the first two-
time individual recipient of this award. It also is the
fourth time the people of Carbide have been recog-
nized, for they shared in two previous group awards—in
1943 for synthetic rubber, and in 1946 for atomic energy.
TRUE SIGNIFICANCE—As in all Chemical Engineer-
ing Achievement Awards, coal hydrogenation was recog-
nized not as the accomplishment of any one individual
but as the result of the cooperative efforts of many.
The people of Union Carbide appreciate the recog-

hazard; all such factors should be con-
sidered by insurance companies in setting
their rates.
Power Production. The role of precipi-
tation in the production of hydroelectric
power is well known, but there are other
potential sources of power which involve
applied meteorology. In Great Britain
wind power is being carefully studied:
the British Electricity Authority has had
constructed a 100 kw. wind generator
using the Andreau system developed in
France. In this, the air flows through an
air turbine near the base of the unit, up
the central vertical column, through the
hollow blades and out the open tips of
the whirling propellor. The diameter of
the circle swept out by the latter is 80
feet. Such wind generators will only be
effective where the mean wind is relatively
high: output increases from zero at a
wind speed of 17 m.p.h. up to 100 kw.
at 30 m.p.h., and remains constant there-
after until the wind speed reaches 65
m.p.h. when the plant shuts down.
Solar energy as a possible source of
power is receiving increasing attention.
The occurrence of cloud is one limiting
factor here. Studies are being made at
Montlouis in the French Pyrenees. Under
the guidance of Felix Trombe, a giant
parabolic mirror and solar furnace have
been constructed which are capable of
drawing 75 kw. from the sun's rays. A
solar stove suitable for family use has
been constructed and successfully tested
in India.
Transportation. Air transport relies very
heavily on meteorological information for
its successful functioning, but meteorology
also enters in a number of other less spec-
tacular ways. Snow avalanches may tie up
road and rail traffic in mountain passes; a
careful analysis of meteorological condi-
tions will tell when the snow avalanche
may be started artificially before an excess
of snow accumulates, so that it can be re-
moved at convenient times and without
danger to traffic. Required methods for
keeping ice off rails, especially at switches,
will vary with the climatic conditions.
Highways may be laid out so as to mini-
mize snow blocking, and snow fences set
out in locations where they will be most
effective. Snow removal by melting by the
application of heat from below is becom-
ing more prevalent; installation of equip-
ment of the appropriate capacity requires
a knowledge of climatological quantities,
of which snowfall is but one. The chief
highway engineer of Oregon has stated
that paved roads are destroyed by two
means, heavy trucks and the weather. The
action of heavy trucks has been studied,
and is increasingly understood, but much
research is still required on the role of
weather.
Highway safety is promoted by cars de-
signed to handle well in turbulent winds.
Professor W. E. Lay and Dr. P. W. Lett,
Jr., have made comprehensive studies of
wind effects on car stability, and the ap-
plication of their results will lead to im-
proved designs.
Other Applications. Many other appli-
cations of meteorology to engineering
problems could be mentioned, but the
above examples will be sufficient to indi-
cate the scope of this young but rapidly
growing field. Indeed, there are many ap-
plications to areas outside of engineering
as that term is usually defined. Among
these may be mentioned forestry, medical
science, public health, veterinary science,
animal husbandry, agriculture, entomol-
ogy. ge°graphy. g^logy. architecture,
town planning, and business administra-
tion.

WELDED DESIGNS
CUT COSTS 50%
BY using steel instead of cast iron,
'design engineers today make their
products more efficient . . . many times at
half the cost. Product designs are strong-
er, more rigid, take less material to build.
Too little attention is usually devoted to
simplification of product designs to elim-
inate costly manufacturing manhours
once a basic design is established. Where
designers reappraise product details for
welded steel construction, production
costs are being cut an average of 5 0% com-
pared with manufacture using castings.
Manufacturing operations are simpli-
fied with welded steel design. Rejections
due to inferior metal are eliminated. Less
machining and finishing are required.
Finished machines are streamlined, more
modern in appearance.
In the example below, an economy-
minded design engineer lowered manu-
facturing cost on a machine arm and cut
weight of the arm.
Before conversion to steel, the machine
arm required 182 pounds of gray iron
and cost $38.2 5 to cast and machine.

itself can be easily cut with the help of
silent sounds . . . ultrasonic vibrations far
beyond the hearing range of human ears.
These vibrations, at frequencies of
27,000 per second, are used by a new
machine tool called the Cavitron. With
them the Cavitron hammers thousands of
tiny abrasive particles against the work
piece with enormous force. The particles,
usually boron carbide, are mixed with
water which flows between the tool and
the work during operation. As the tool
drives them into the work, they chisel
out minute pieces until the right shape is
obtained.
The Cavitron can cut highly intricate
shapes that even modern machine tools
have difficulty handling. For example:
it can "drill" a corkscrew-shaped hole.
Yet it can also do the simple operations
such as cutting, threading, and embossing.
If close tolerances are required, the Cavi-
tron can hold them to 0.0003-inch.
Cavitron's inventor, Dr. L. Balamuth,
searched extensively for an effective way
to produce the ultrasonic vibrations he
needed. Finally he decided that rapidly re-
peated contractions of a metal, excited by
a magnetic field, would do the job.
Physicists call this action in a metal
"magnetostrictive." But Dr. Balamuth
had to find a metal which could shrink a
measurable distance and revert to size
over a million-and-a-half times per min-
ute.
He tried Nickel . . . the same metal
used to produce the searching vibrations
for sonar equipment. Nickel has the high-
est magnetostrictive value of any com-
mercial material readily available.
With this problem solved, the Cavitron
has proved it can shape the very hard
metallics such as AInico and Stellite, as
well as non-metallics like quartz and
glass. So far it is used to manufacture
parts for the aeronautical, jewelry, and
electronics industries. But future applica-
tions seem almost unlimited. The Cavitron
Ultrasonic Machine Tool is manufactured

Dental Work on the Battle Field
Junior's electric train helped University
of Michigan dental researchers solve a
difficult field problem for the Army:
how to fill a soldier's tooth near the
scene of battle.
Dr. Floyd A. Peyton, in charge of the
Physical Research Laboratories of the
University of Michigan's School of Den-
tistry, working under the sponsorship of
the Army's Office of the Surgeon General,
has announced the development of a den-
tal handpiece which contains its own
motor.
A dental handpiece is that instrument
which holds the drill or polishing bur.
It usually is attached to a motor by means
of a long arm with pulleys through which
are threaded long cords that drive the
shaft in the handpiece.
The new handpiece, containing its own
motor, now can be transported to the
battlefield, clipped to the battery of a
jeep and operated on the spot. And it all
started with an electric train motor.
"Our problem was to produce an inex-
pensive yet efficient instrument which
could be used in on-the-spot operations,"
reported Dr. Peyton. The project began
two years ago.
Needing a small motor capable of du-
plicating the power of the conventionally
driven handpiece, Dr. Peyton and his as-
sociate, Dr. Edwin E. Henry, instructor
and research associate in the dental school,
experimented with a toy train motor. The
researchers attached the train motor to a
conventional handpiece by means of nuts,
bolts and plastic gears. The original model
proved to be clumsy, but the principle
worked.
The present model, which Dr. Peyton
describes as "nearing completion," con-
tains a built-in motor. The handpiece is
attached by means of a cord to a small
sewing machine foot pedal, which regu-
lates the speed. The pedal then is con-
nected by means of clips and a cord to a
regular Army jeep's storage battery.
In appearance, the revolutionary hand-
piece resembles an aluminum ball-point
pen, with a knob on the end about the size
of a medium spool of thread. The in-
strument is equivalent in size to the con-
ventional six-inch long handpiece and, at
less than eight ounces, weighs approxi-
mately the same.
The built-in motor handpiece is capable
of generating speeds equivalent to that
of the conventional handpiece, up to
6,000 r.p.m. Increases in speed are likely,
reported Dr. Pelton, by using a "stepped-
up" motor, without at the same time dis-
turbing the simplicity of the new instru-
ment.

Mechanical, electrical, civil, aeronau-
tical — in fact, graduates in virtually
every field of engineering—find reward-
ing career opportunities here. There
are openings in design, research, in the
many phases of production, and for
physicists and mathematicians with
advanced degrees.
All engineering careers at Boeing
have one thing in common: they pro-
vide plenty of opportunity to get ahead.
Regular merit reviews are held. Ad-
vancement is keyed to your individual
ability, application and initiative.
The aviation industry offers you a
unique opportunity to gain experience
with new techniques and new materials.
It offers a wide range of application,
from applied research, to product de-
sign and production, all going on at
the same time.
What's more, you can expect long-
term career stability in the aviation in-
dustry. Boeing, for instance, is now
in its 37th year of operation, and actu-
ally employs more engineers today than
even at the peak of World War II.
Besides designing and building the
world's most advanced multi-jet air-
craft (the B-47 and B-52), Boeing con-
ducts one of the nation's major guided
missile programs, and such other proj-
ects as research on supersonic flight,
and nuclear power for aircraft.
Boeing engineering activity is con-
centrated at Seattle, Washington, and
Wichita, Kansas — communities with
a wide variety of recreational opportu-
nities as well as schools of higher
learning. The Company will arrange
a reduced work week to permit time
for graduate study and will reimburse
tuition upon successful completion of
each quarter's work.

"We feel that we have accomplished
our mission," reported Dr. Peyton. He
predicted that the new handpiece could be
manufactured to sell for approximately
one-fourth the cost of the conventional
headpiece and motor.
Dr. Peyton, who last February an-
nounced the development of another
equally revolutionary dental handpiece
utilizing tiny ball bearings, expects that
the built-in motor instrument will have
civilian as well as military uses, especially
in hospital and clinical oral surgery.
"The present six-volt driven hand-
piece has been tried at the University Hos-
pital in oral surgery," said Dr. Peyton,
"and it has the advantage of greater sim-
plicity in maintaining a sterile operation."
The entire handpiece, motor and all, is
being designed so that it can be sterilized,
eliminating the necessity for enclosing
the more complex instrument and its de-
tached motor in a sterile sleeve.
"We have reached the point where our
handpiece approaches the equivalent in
performance of the conventional instru-
ment, and further refinements are forth-
coming," said Dr. Peyton.
Navy Minesweeper
Wesringhouse Builds Non-Magnetic
Mine Sweeper Drives
For the manufacture of reduction-gear
units to transmit power from engines to
propellers of non-magnetic mine sweep-
ers, Westinghouse Electric Corporation
is using non-magnetic alloys. These in-
clude Discaloy, Ampcoloy, and stainless
steel of the non-magnetic type.
Discaloy, originally developed for high-
temperature applications, is non-magnetic
and has good physical properties at nor-
mal temperatures. Ampcoloy can be heat
treated to a high Brinnell hardness and
has unusual physical properties for an
aluminum bronze alloy.
Some of the castings required for these
units are the largest ever made from cast
aluminum where machining to close tol-
erance is required.
Use of these materials, all having dif-
ferent thermal coefficients, created prob-
lems not usually encountered in industrial
applications.
Douglas X-3
A new shape of things to come in high
speed flight was revealed today as the Air
Force prepared to turn the flying labora-
Non-magnetic Minesweeper Drive.
tory over to the National Advisory Com-
mittee for Aeronautics for further re-
search.
The X-3 was designed and built by the
Douglas Aircraft company's Santa Monica
Division under joint sponsorship of the
Air Force, NACA and the Navy. The
project was directed by the Air Research
and Development Command to test the
design features of an aircraft suitable for
sustained flights at extremely high speeds.
It has been undergoing flight tests here
since October, 1952, with Douglas test
pilot Bill Bridgeman at the controls.
Other research aircraft previously an-
nounced include the Air Force's Bell X-l,
X-2, X-5, and the Northrop X-4, and the
Navy's Douglas D-558-1 and D-558-2.
Appearance of the X-3 is striking. It
has a slender fuselage with an extremely
long, tapered nose and short wings locat-
ed well back toward the tail. Viewed from
above, the X-3 resembles a huge stiletto.
Length of the X-3 is 66 feet 9 inches,
nearly three times its span of 22 feet 8
inches. The top of its tail, rising on a
boom over the twin-jet exhausts, measures
12 and one-half feet from the ground.
The airplane stands on tricycle landing
gear which retract into the fuselage.
Although the gross weight and length
of the "flying stiletto" slightly exceed
those of the familiar DC-3 transport, the
X-3 wing span is less than the span of
the DC-3 tail.
Before the X-3 was built, more than
60 individual designs with all potential
supersonic power plants—separately and
in various combinations—were consider-
ed by Douglas engineers working with
specialists of the Air Force and the
NACA.
Their ultimate selection was a mid-
wing monoplane of unique proportions
powered by the two axial flow turbojet
engines. This combination, it was felt,
provided the best basis for eventual de-
velopment into practical, operational air-
craft.
Military restrictions prohibit disclosure
of performance data obtained during nu-
merous test flights by Bridgeman.
Problems solved in the X-3 design in-
volved not only aerodynamics but uses of
new materials and construction methods.
One important contribution to the na-
tion's future aircraft has been the de-
velopment of fabrication and construction
techniques with titanium, used extensively
throughout the X-3.
The aircraft is artificially refrigerated
with a cooling system of tremendous
capacity, and insulation has been provided
to protect the pilot, instruments and other
internal equipment further from blistering
temperatures encountered in sustained,
high speed flight.
Instead of armament, the X-3 carries a
payload of 1200 pounds of research in-
struments, many of which were specially
made for the airplane and supplied by
NACA. Comprehensive instrumentation
includes more than 850 "pin hole" ori-
fices to record pressures over various por-
tions of the airplane. Temperature read-
ings are registered at 150 points while
stresses and air loads are indicated by 185
electric strain gages.
Information obtained in the design,
development and flight tests of the X-3
is being made available to the aircraft in-
dustry through NACA and military chan-
nels.

• "Worthington was my choice," Mr. Berger says, "be-
cause of the excellent training and the unusual experiences
that are possible with a manufacturer having a worldwide
reputation, and worldwide distribution. Then, when a
company has seventeen divisions, including air condition-
ing, refrigeration, turbines, Diesel engines, compressors
and pumps of all kinds, construction machinery, and
power transmission equipment, a graduate engineer's
chances for getting into his chosen field are even better.
"Supporting these divisions are research, engineering,
production, purchasing, and sales, domestic and export.
The real opportunity, however, is in Worthington itself.
This is a company that is growing, just as it has for more
than a century. It is always looking for new, related
products and good men to engineer, produce, and sell
them—at home and abroad.
"I began my career with Worthington's training pro-
gram in the Research and Development Laboratory, where
full-scale equipment is designed, tested and improved.
This experience gave me an understanding of the tremen-
dous part the company plays in the everyday life of mil-
lions of people. Within fourteen months I was sent to
Mexico to inspect the facilities of our distributors there.
"The opportunities for first-hand laboratory experience,
sales training and contact, travel and field trips, among
many others, make Worthington a first-rate company for
the young engineer with a desire to learn and progress in
his work."
When you're thinking of a good job, think high—think

Unit No. 1 from the area. The plant fire
brigade then attempted to fight the fire
from the roof with hose from 1^2" stand-
pipes, but again the smoke was so dense
it forced them to leave the roof.
The fire spread very rapidly under the
roof in a westerly and northerly direction,
aided primarily by the burning tar drip-
pings and also by oil accumulation on the
roof members, above the oil hardening
area immediately adjoining the point of
fire origin.
Observers stated that molten tar was

At approximately 4:15 p.m. roof and
wall collapse was starting in Unit No. 1
and progressed rapidly through the struc-
ture.
It is reported that at the beginning, the
fire was not continuous along a unit area
but that molten tar would drop well in
advance of the fire causing spot fires
which eventually joined. This develop-
ment was so rapid that the fire traveled
the full length of this 1,800 foot build-
ing in approximately II/4 hours.

dropping from the roof deck 100 ft. or so
in advance of the actual fire itself, and
two employees who had endeavored to
fight the fire were burned by this molten
tar in many spots on their arms and
shoulders.
The rapid spread of smoke and heat
also was materially influenced by the
powerful mechanical ventilating units
which were operating before the power
was shut off which occurred about ten
minutes after the start of the fire.
The wind apparently had very little
effect, the wind velocity being 8 to 12
miles per hour in a westerly direction.
Additional help was summoned from
surrounding municipalities and apparatus
from Plymouth, Redford, Wayne, Ply-
mouth (Township), Dearborn and De-
It is evident that the extreme heat was
traveling in a stratum under the roof, and
it is estimated that the temperature in this
area during the fire was between 1,500
and 2,000 degrees F. Proof of this is the
fact that roof trusses that were warped
and twisted by the heat and fire ultimate-
ly fell on combustible materials, such as
cardboard cartons, which themselves were
largely damaged.
Another contributing factor to the rapid
spread of the fire was the large number
of machines having oil in their reservoirs,
which either ignited from the burning tar
running down on the equipment or pro-
vided an oily vapor which fed the flames.
There was no explosion at any time
other than in scattered drums and, con-
trary to some reports, the "Rust-Ban"
solution in the dip tanks was not a serious
factor in the fire; in fact, at the time the
fire fighting employees were forced out of
the building, the contents of none of
these dip tanks had become ignited.
The spot where the fire started was un-
sprinklered, and by the time the fire and
heat reached the "spot-sprinklered" sec-
tions it was so intense that the sprinklers
were of no avail, although many heads
were opened during early stages of the
fire. It was soon recognized that with so
many sprinkler heads fused and no longer
effective, and since many overhead sprink-
ler lines were ruptured by reason of roof
collapse the fire department quickly—and
properly—closed the outside valves shut-
ting off the sprinkler system.
There was no lack of water for the fire
department hose lines, but due to their
inability to reach the seat of the fire they
were of little value.
This could be described as a "high
level" fire, since actual flame and burning
was observed to spread and progress
along and through the roof members, ob-
viously supported by combustible vapors
and gases accumulating ahead of the fire-
front, before it involved combustible ma-
terials on the floor.
The fire practically burned itself out.
There were approximately 4,200 em-
ployees on the premises. In spite of the
fact that the fire spread with such rapid-
ity, buildings were quickly evacuated. It
is regretted that three persons lost their
lives in the fire, apparently having gone
back heroically into the fire several times
to help in rescue activity. Another of the
fire fighters died from a heart attack ap-
parently from his efforts in extinguishing
the fire.
A large number of employees and fire-
men were either overcome by smoke or
sustained injuries of varying degrees and
required first aid and some hospitalization.
While the floor of the manufacturing
area had a working surface of creosoted
wood blocks which were charred and
burned to varying degrees, their burning
created heat but did not contribute ma-
terially to the spread of the fire.
The entire one-story manufacturing
building, representing a fire area of ap-
proximately 1,370,000 sq. ft. was practi-
cally a total loss, although the adjoining
two-story section suffered little damage;
nor did the detached building suffer any

JLhe great majority of cast iron pressure
pipe produced today is cast centrifugally, in metal or
sand-lined molds.
When this mechanized process was introduced 27
years ago, its potentialities for improved production
controls were evident. For human fallibility was largely
replaced by machine accuracy based on scientific
principles.
The improved production controls made possible by
the centrifugal casting process have long since been
realized. Hundreds of millions of feet of centrifugally-
cast- iron pressure pipe are now in service. All of thispipe
is more uniform in metal structure, in wall thickness,
and in concentricity, than pipe not centrifugally cast.
Better production control means better pipe; it re-
sults in greater uniformity of quality.
Production controls in cast iron pipe foundries start
almost literally from the ground up with inspection,
analysis and testing of raw materials; continue with
constant control of cupola operation by metal analysis;
and end with rigid tests of the finished product.
By metallurgical controls and tests of materials, our
members are able to produce cast iron pipe with exact
knowledge of the physical characteristics of the iron
before it is poured into the mold of a centrifugal casting
machine.
Cast iron pipe is the standard material for water
and gas mains and is widely used in sewage works
construction.

ELECTRODEPOSITED NICKEL
(Continued from page 20)
parison of the microstructures of the two types of deposits
shows large clean grains in the Watts nickel while the bright
nickel deposits have dark areas which may indicate either
inclusions or voids.
On the basis of the data obtained in the investigation, it ap-
pears that the widely varying properties shown by electrode-
posted nickel are determined primarily by the chemical and
physical nature of codeposited impurities—usually small quan-
tities of oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, or other elements present
in small fractions of a percent. This is shown not only by
the parallel trend in the variation of many of the properties,
indicating a common basic cause, but also in the correlations
found between properties and crystal or microstructure and in
the pronounced dependence of the properties on bath com-
position. Because large changes in the deposits result from the
presence of certain types of ions or minute amounts of special
additions to the plating bath, it is reasonable to assume that
the distinctive character of the deposits is caused by the code-
position of various kinds of foreign matter which may vary in
quantity as well as in effectiveness. The codeposted material
may sometimes influence the properties of the deposit directly;
in other cases, it may result in fine-grained structure, perhaps
with lattice distortion and internal stresses, which in turn
affects the physical and mechanical properties of the deposits.
In general, it would seem that substances present in the
plating solution affect the properties of the electrodeposit
only to the extent that they influence the codeposition of for-
eign material. Thus, the great differences in the properties of
bright-nickel and Watts-nickel deposits can be ascribed to im-
purities in the bright nickel derived from the organic additives
used to produce the brightening. In fact, the Bureau's analysis
of the bright-nickel deposits showed that they contained car-
bon and sulfur inclusions totalyling about 0.1 percent, whereas
the Watts-nickel deposits did not contain these impurities. On
the other hand, some of the variations in the mechanical prop-
erties of the Watts-nickel deposits can be attributed to the
presence of small amounts of oxide. For example, a good cor-
relation was found to exist between the mechanical properties
of Watts-nickel deposits and their oxygen content.
It thus becomes apparent that those electrodeposited coat-
ings that are of value in industry are not pure coatings, but owe
their valuable properties to the presence of small amounts of
impurities. The smooth, thick electrodeposits used by the plat-
ing industry are actually exceptional inasmuch as the pure
metals would be deposited as a mass of large crystals rather
than a coherent layer.
The mechanism by which foreign material is codeposited
with nickel is a matter of speculation, but the NBS study in-
dicates that it is probably an adsorption phenomenon rather
than an electrochemical one, as has sometimes been postulated.
The adsorption hypothesis is sufficiently versatile to explain
the very specific effects of certain additives and the influence
of the anion of a plating solution on the nature of the deposit.
Some substances, instead of being directly absorbed, may so
modify the pH of the cathode that basic compounds are code-
posited with the metal. Further research is needed on adsorp-
tion phenomena and the processes taking place in the cathode
film during electrolysis. More precise methods of analysis will
be required in order to correlate the content of foreign material
with lattice distortion and crystal structure.

ONLY FILM TYPE RESISTORS
HIOHER STABILITY STANDARDS
BASIC TECHNIQUE
A thin coating of pre-cured and
stabilized resistance material
is bonded to special glass or an
inorganic core to form IRC's
exclusive filament type ele-
ment. This is in contrast to the
carbon pill or slug principle of
construction. Its uniformity and
stability have proved superior
since the earliest days of radio.
SPECIFIC EXAMPLES
IRC Type BOC Boron Carbon Precistors
IRC Filament Type BT Resistors
IRC Type DC Deposited Carbon Resistors
IRC Type MV High Voltage Resistors
... another reason why engineers prefer IRC Resistors
Advancing requirements of instrumentation, military
electronics and television focus emphasis on greater
stability for non-wire wound resistors. IRC believes its
filament type construction offers the best answer to
more exacting standards. For over 28 years the film type
resistance element has proved its superior stability—
even in today's newest IRC Boron-Carbon Precistor.

Davidson, B.S.E.(M.E.), and William O.
Heyn, B.S.E.(M.E.) (all from the class
of 1951), were presented with degrees of
Master of Automotive Engineering by
the Chrysler Institute of Engineering.
This two year post graduate program is
designed to prepare selected men for re-
sponsible engineering positions with the
Chrysler Motor Company. The men were
selected for this program on the basis of
their grades at the University, personal
characteristics, extracurricular activities,
previous work experience and recommen-
dations of former professors and advisors.
Their class consisted of fifty-two engineer-
ing graduates from twenty-nine colleges
and universities throughout the United
States and Canada.
Everett G. Fahlman, B.S.E.(Chem.E.) '18
Everett G. Fahlman has been appointed
Deputy Director of the Aluminum Divi-
sion, National Production Authority, De-
partment of Commerce. He is on leave
from his active presidency of Permold
Company, Medina, Ohio. He also holds
the position of President of Gordon Mfg.
Co., Ltd., Wallaceburg, Ont., Canada.
Gabru Miah Chowdhury, B.S.E.(C.E.) '30
Gabru Miah Chowdhury is Executive
Engineer in the Communication and
Building Department, Government of
East Pakistan. This high government po-
sition involves administration of con-
struction machines and materials valued
at many millions of dollars. Mr. Chowd-
bury's service with government began in
India in 1939- After the partition of Paki-
stan he migrated to the new nation.
The first submarine installation of a pipe-type
Came System was recently installed under the Hudson River
at Poughkeepsie, N. Y. Three cables, each nearly % -miles long,
were simultaneously pulled into a six-inch welded steel pipe laid
across the river bottom. The pipe was then filled with oil main-
tained at 200 lbs. pressure, enabling a 110,000-volt power circuit
to cross the river safely.
This kind of system is called Oilostatic — a design which has long
been first choice among utilities for handling large blocks of power
by means of a high-pressure pipe-type cable system. Increased cir-
cuit reliability and savings on installation and maintenance costs
are realized.
Oilostatic's new role as a submarine cable is typical of the sig-
nificant contributions to better electrical service made by Okonite
engineers. • • •
Tough jobs are the true test of electri-
cal cable... and installations on such
jobs usually turn out to be Okonite.

How to keep buried wheels
turning smoothly
Hidden under the pile of dirt (see arrow) is a 4-wheel
truck that backs up this ditch digger's whirling buckets.
To prevent breakdowns, the wheel bearings had to be
able to absorb the shocks cf boulders and the digging
action itself. And they had to be protected from the dirt.
The engineers who designed this application licked both
problems by mounting the truck's wheels on Timken®
tapered roller bearings. Timken bearings absorb the
shocks because they have tough, shock-resistant cores
under hard, wear-resistant surfaces. And Timken bear-
ings make closures more effective.
How TIMKEN bearings help
keep dirt out—lubricant in
Timken bearings make closures more effective because
they hold the housings and shafts concentric. As a re-
sult, dirt can't get in—lubricant can't get out. Main-
tenance is minimized. Continuous, trouble-free opera-
tion is assured.

There are two questions that immediate-
ly come to mind in connection with this
fire:
1. How could it get such a start?
2. How could it involve the entire
plant?
Here was a type of building that has
been in use for several years throughout
the country and has generally been classi-
fied by fire underwriters, industry and
building contractors as non-combustible.
The answer to both questions apparently

bricating and quenching oils contributed
to the spread of the fire, both in their
liquid and vaporized state, it is not felt
this condition would have caused the
rapid spread of fire had not the molten
tar and asphalt been present.
There is one outstanding lesson to be
learned from this loss, which is: that

CONSTRUCTION AND OCCUPANCY CON-

seems to be that the type of roof used
here in the absence of automatic sprinkler
protection will not withstand heat to any
high degree or for any length of time
without buckling and permitting tar, as-
phalt and pitch, which are used in very
large quantities in the roof covering, to
drop in a molten state into the area below
and thus sustain and rapidly spread the
fire.
A complete sprinkler system in a build-
ing of this construction would have prob-
ably kept this roof sufficiently cool so
that the asphalt would not have become
molten and dropped into the building,
thus allowing the private and public fire
fighting services to extinguish any fire that
might have developed.
While the large quantity of cutting, lu-
There are three safeguards that could
take care of this situation.
(A) Plants of this character should be
completely sprinklered. Had this risk
been so equipped it is believed that the
cooling effect from the sprinklers would
have been sufficient to prevent any roof
collapse and the fire could have been ex-
tinguished with chemical extinguishers
and hose streams with little damage.
(B) Buildings of such tremendous
areas should have division walls and fire
stops to allow public and private fire de-
partments to fight any fire that may get
away from the sprinkler system for any
reason whatsoever. This particular fire
was not extinguished; it burned itself out.
(C) A thoroughly trained, organized
and equipped private fire fighting organi-
zation, with proper alarm service, is
vitally necessary.
AND, FINALLY, THIS LOSS COULD HAVE
BEEN PREVENTED HAD PROPER CUTTING
AND WELDING PRECAUTIONS BEEN
taken. The best way this can be accom-
plished is for top management to insist
that no cutting or welding be permitted
in a plant by anybody unless proper steps
have been taken before the work is done
to prevent a fire, or in case one does start
to have the necessary equipment and man-
power immediately at hand to extinguish
the fire quickly. No welder, either in the
employ of the plant or an outside con-
tractor, should be permitted to take the
chance of burning down the plant regard-
less of how large or small the cutting or
welding job may be.

A group of men were in the club be-
fore dinner. The talk, for no good rea-
son, turned to married life.
"Well," said one fellow, "the real
comfort in life comes when you are
settled down with one woman you love.
You can argue all you want, but it's my
opinion that, once settled down, most
men remain faithful."
Most of the men agreed with him, but
an older man in the group shook his
head. "I don't agree at all," he asserted.
"And if you fellows are honest, you'll
know I'm right. I'll bet any and all of
you men a new hat there isn't one of you
who hasn't strayed from the straight and
narrow since he's married."
"I'll take that bet," cried one, swiftly.
"How long have you been married?''
asked the cynic.
"Since last Saturday," was the reply.
The crowd roared, of course—and one
of the listeners was so amused that he
could hardly wait to get home and tell his
wife about it. At the end of the story he
laughed and laughed. But his laughter
died as he noticed a strange expression
on his wife's face. "Don't you think the
story very funny?"
"Very funny," she replied, "but
where's your new hat?"

FOREIGN STUDENTS
The record breaking 1070 foreign students
enrolled in this University puts Michigan in
step with other colleges throughout the coun-
try. There are more foreign students enrolled
in American schools this year than ever before.
Although exact figures have not yet been re-
leased indications are that last years 34,000
record enrollment will be surpassed.
The increasing number of students from
abroad is evidence of the interests that exists
around the world in specific American develop-
ments that are of benefit to the whole world.
This perhaps explains the large numbers of
foreign students found in such colleges as engi-
neering, medicine, agriculture, etc.
Most of our visitors from abroad come to
study in the U.S. because comparable educa-
tional facilities are limited, or do not exist, in
their countries. Upon returning to their coun-
tries they will be authorities in their fields. As
such they will have much to contribute in mak-
ing their countries more prosperous and pro-
gressive. Collectively their contributions will
have a great influence in making the world a
better place to live.
Studying in a foreign country is not an easy
matter. To surmount the difficulties of the lan-
guage barrier and the problems of adjustment
in a different way of life requires much work.
Foreign students who are able to complete suc-
cessfully their education in the United States
possess exceptional ability and perseverance.
Students from abroad studying in the United
States enjoy about the same rights that every
American citizen enjoys. They are subjected to
no intellectual or any other kind of regimenta-
tion. They are free to move around see for
themselves how the American people live and
work and most important of all they are free
to observe and investigate for themselves the
practicality of our democratic system in action.
The presence of these young people from every
continent of the world affords us a great oppor-
tunity to tell and show the world what America
really stands for.

TORRINGTON NEEDLE BEARINGS
help make products more compact
These days, design engineers have
to consider sales charts as well as
blueprints and specifications.
Two portable electric drills,
for example, may have the same
capacity, the same speed, the
same chucks and the same price,
yet one may outsell the other.
Factors like overall appearance,
compactness, and light weight
often contribute to product
success.
Unique Design
Promotes
Compact Designs
The Torrington Needle Bearing
has been used in many products
because of the weight and space
savings it affords. Its unique de-
sign—a thin hardened outer shell
retaining a full complement of
small diameter rollers—gives it
maximum capacity in minimum
space. In fact, for its size and
weight, the Needle Bearing can
carry higher radial loads than any
other type of anti-friction bearing.
Permits Reduction
in Size and Weight
of Related Parts
In the electric drill shown here
the small size of the Needle Bear-
ing permits close shaft center
distances to make for overall
compactness. And, since Needle
Bearings are press-mounted in
plain round housing bores—with-
out retaining rings or shoulders—
housings can be made smaller and
lighter. The fact that Needle
Bearings require no inner race
when running on hardened shafts
results in further savings, without
sacrificing capacity or durability.
Needle Bearings are in use on
many other products where com-
pactness and light weight are im-
portant design factors. Aircraft,
small gasoline engines, hydraulic

OF THE ATOM
Edited by CHARLES STICKELS, '55 (Chem-Met)
Engineering dreams of utilizing the
atom for industrial tasks are a step closer
to reality, for an international congress
meets this June at Ann Arbor, Michigan,
to discuss peacetime uses of atomic
energy.
Among the varied peacetime uses of
nuclear products, apart from power gen-
eration, are sterilization of foods and
drugs and the use of isotopes as tracers
in medical and technological processes.
Industry is using irradiated substances to
gauge thicknesses of materials by measur-
ing the amount of radiation absorbed.
Radioactive substances are being used to
activate switches for precise controls. Ra-
diocarbon dating is the name given to
science's new method for measuring the
age of organic materials. The process de-
pends on measuring the amount of radio-
active Carbon 14 emitted from dead or-
ganic bodies, the half life of Carbon 14
being 5568 years. Recently a strain of oats
was produced, the result of a mutation
brought about by radioactivity. These oats
show remarkable resistance to rust.
These are some of the known uses of
nuclear energy and it is expected that
they will be expanded and others come to
light as a result of the free interchange
of ideas at this conference.
The congress is sponsored by the Amer-
ican Society of Chemical Engineers and
the University of Michigan. Plans for the
meeting have been underway for more
than a year by the Nuclear Energy Com-
mittee of the American Institute of Chem-
ical Engineers. This committee is com-
posed of some 15 members representing
industry, the Atomic Energy Commission,
government laboratories, and universities.
These people have solicited papers to pro-
vide the latest engineering information on
nuclear power reactors, research reactors,
materials of construction, preparation of
nuclear fuels, processing in irradiated
materials, and the applications of radio-
active products. Of the more than 80
papers to be presented a good many con-
tained classified material at the time they
were written and are now in the process

arrangements through the Special Assis-
tant to the Secretary of State for Atomic-
Energy to have all persons from foreign
countries who desire to attend the meeting
cleared so that there will be no embarrass-

contemplated that a dozen papers will be
given by representatives from six foreign
countries. Some time ago over 30 people
had been cleared to attend the sessions

ENGINEERING
By CHARLES STICKELS, '55 (Chem-Met)
Ann Arbor—A Nuclear Engineering
program leading to a Master of Science
of Engineering (Nuclear) degree has
been started at Michigan. The program
consists of nineteen hours from the eight
courses offered plus electives which ful-
fill the requirements for the master's de-
gree and which meet with the approval
of the Committee on Nuclear Engineer-
ing. This Committee is composed of
representatives from various engineering
fields and administers the program. As-
sociate Professor H. J. Gomberg (E.E.)
is chairman. The other members of the
Committee are Assistant Professor Bor-
chardt (C.E.); Associate Professor Brown-
ell (Chem.E.); Assistant Professor Kerr
(E.E.); Professor Nichols (Aero); Professor
Schwartz (Meek).
The requirements for the course are a
bachelor's degree in any recognized
field of engineering including Engineer-
ing Physics and approval by the commit-
tee. Some of the basic courses may be
taken in a student's senior year.
Arrangements are being made with
Argonne National Laboratory and Oak
Ridge National Laboratory so that inter-
ested students can obtain practical ex-
In 1920 a great war had just ended; a
war that had brought hardship and suffer-
ing abroad, but a war that had brought
aviation to the United States. Aviation
meant the future for young men of the
'20's, and their interest and the seeming
limitless horizons of aviation spurred
industry and nourished the growth of
aeronautical curricula at schools and uni-
versities throughout the United States.
The tremendous accomplishments of avia-
tion through these last 35 years are a
tribute to the vision and enthusiasm of
these young men.
Now, 30 years later we can see about
us a situation closely paralleling the de-
velopment of aviation in the '20's. This
most recent great war has bequeathed to
this generation atomic energy, and to to-
day's young men this is the future; to the
University and to industry of today goes
the task of duplicating aviation's feats.
But, the young man of today cannot
like his father in the '20's take an engi-
neering degree and then begin lending a
hand in his developing field. For a pros-
perience working with nuclear reactors.
It is expected, however, that the Uni-
versity's application for a reactor will
soon be granted by the Atomic Energy
Commission and in a few years students
will be able to work with a reactor here
in Ann Arbor.
So far two men have received degrees
in the program. This year there are eight
men enrolled in the program and a total
of thirty taking various courses in the
program. The courses in the program
are: Introduction to Nuclear Engineer-
ing; Measurement in Nuclear Engineer-
ing; Procedure and Design in Handling
of Radioactive Material; Interaction of
Radiation and Matter; Wave Mechanics
in Nuclear Engineering; Theory of Nu-
clear Reactors; Practice of Nuclear
Engineering; Thesis Problems. These
courses are designed to give a practical
base in Nuclear Engineering from which
either peacetime or wartime applica-
tion can be made.
In a speech before a meeting of elec-
trical engineers in New York last month
Associate Professor Gomberg said, "The
lifeblood of any such new development
pective nuclear engineer an engineering
degree is only the beginning; he must
acquire a solid background in physics,
chemistry, electronics and mathematics
before he can begin to learn applied nu-
cleonics. For those students whose inter-
ests and talents would lead them to nu-
clear engineering this article is written;
I intend it as a review of some of the
educational opportunities available here at
Michigan and at government institutions
(notably, Oak Ridge).
The development of peacetime uses for
atomic energy has received considerable
impetus on this campus due to the Uni-
versity's Phoenix Project begun shortly
after the war. The building of a million
dollar nuclear reactor and accompanying
research equipment should place this
school among the best-equipped in the na-
tion. In keeping with this progress the
Engineering College has instituted courses
within various departments and has ar-
ranged graduate degree programs in nu-
clear engineering. Almost all of these
programs include project work at gov-
[industrial use of atomic power] is men
trained in the new discipline and thinking
necessary to carry the new field for-
ward. Yet today, there is one majof
source of such men—the Oak Ridge
School of Reactor Technology. The
source of almost all information needed
in the nuclear power field is the Atomic
Energy Commission." In the same
speech he also said, "the training of new
men in an atmosphere of emphasis on in-
dustrial application as opposed to exclu-
sive government utilization must be
brought Into being rapidly. Industry must
begin to move so as to take up the
responsibility for this new development
and to convince the young men that
the outline for their talents is broader
than governmental service." This need
for nuclear research to be done by
someone other than the government
lest all our nuclear research be put into
military uses is one of the main reasons
why the University is offering this pro-
gram. Because of this concentration to
date in wartime applcation of nuclear
power, there are many opportunities for
men in the peacetime applications.
eminent laboratories (e.g. Oak Ridge or
Argonne National Laboratories) since
much of this subject matter is still classi-
fied information.
Developments in nucleonics have pro-
ceeded in three general directions and the
study of each requires a somewhat dif-
ferent approach. First, atomic energy has
developed as a tool for scientific and engi-
neering study. The use of radioactive
tracers to study the course of chemical re-
actions is an obvious example. Second, de-
velopment of radioactive materials has led
to studies of how radiation affects its sur-
roundings. The engineering problems of
shielding come under this category. And
last, atomic energy has developed as a
source of immense power. Under this
heading falls the development work lead-
ing to atomic bombs and the leashing of
atomic power through nuclear reactors.
While progress in these first two cate-
gories offers opportunities for engineering
development that are of undisputed im-
portance, they can, for the most part, be
treated within established engineering

can produce a wide variety of measuring
devices dependent upon radiation and the
structural engineer should be able to at-
tack shielding problems through methods
already established. But this third cate-
gory, this new source of such tremendous
power, cannot be treated adequately with-
in other fields; this is the special meat of
the nuclear engineer.
For the young engineer considering
education in nucleonics two alternative
paths for graduate study seem open; he
can obtain his training at the University,
or he can attend a government-sponsored
school at one of the National Labora-
tories. However, in reality, to get the best
education not either but both paths must
be followed. The prospective nuclear
engineer must have a sound background
in math (differential equations, boundary
value problems, and perhaps vector an-
alysis, Fourier series and other more ad-
vance topics) and inorganic chemistry,
and take courses in atomic physics, nuclear
physics, physical chemistry, physical
metallurgy, engineering mechanics, fluid
dynamics, heat transfer, and electronics.
The place to obtain this background is the
University.
With this sort of a background the stu-
dent's education in applied nucleonics can
commence, assured of a sound foundation.
At present, the best place to learn applied
nucleonics is the Oak Ridge School of Re-
actor Technology (in governmentese,
ORSORT). This is a part of the training
division of the Oak Ridge National Lab-
oratory which is operated for the Atomic
Energy Commission by Carbide and Car-
bon Chemicals division of Union Carbide.
These people give a 50 week training
program in reactor technology designed to
provide advanced education in reactor
theory and technology to engineers and
scientists who will engage directly in re-
actor research, design, and development."
The curriculum at ORSORT is broken
down into several courses: Reactor Analy-
sis (180 hours) deals with the basic
theory of the nuclear chain reactor. Re-
actor Engineering (72 hours) breaks
down the reactor system into its constit-
uent engineering problems and employs
engineering technique for their solution.
Reactor Technology (90 hours) is given
in three parts: reactor shielding, reactor
control, and reactor feasibility studies.
Experimental Reactor Physics (72 hours)
provides a background in classical atomic
and elementary nuclear phenomena by
performing experiments of theoretical im-
portance. Reactor Materials (72 hours)

concerns the properties of reactor ma-
terials. Reactor Chemistry (72 hours)
covers the separation processes related to
the operation of nuclear reactors and Re-
actor Nuclear Physics (45 hours) pro-
vides additional background to aid in
understanding the nuclear processes occur-
ring in reactors. In addition to this course
work, to culminate the session ten to
twelve week Reactor Design Problems are
attacked by teams of students and a group
thesis is prepared.
As of last September ORSORT has 212
alumni most of whom are presently en-
gaged in research and development in the
atomic energy program in industrial or-
ganizations, the U. S. Atomic Energy
Commission, and the National Military
Establishment. Among the 43 industrial
organizations employing ORSORT alumni
are: Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing, Bab-
cock &amp; Wilcox Tube, Bendix Aviation,
Boeing, Consolidated Vultee, Pratt &amp;
Whitney, and North American Aviation
Companies, Westinghouse, G. E., DuPont,
Monsanto, Hercules Powder, Metropoli-
tan Edison, Newport News Shipbuilding,
and others stretching from one end of the
industrial spectrum to the other. This
widespread interest among industries of
such diverse nature is a clear indication
of the almost limitless potential for atomic
energy, nuclear reactors, and their many
applications. This range shows the scope
of nuclear engineering, and the variety of
work for the nuclear engineer.
A treatment as brief as this of such an
important topic is bound to be inadequate
for a person interested in educating him-
self in applied nucleonics. Unfortunately,
I know of no single book or recent maga-
zine article which has dealt with this
problem. However, information on an
academic program here could undoubtedly
be obtained from departmental counselors
and information on ORSORT can be ob-
tained by writing

GM's Firebird is First Gas Turbine Auto
The first gas turbine automobile ever
to be built and tested in the United States
was announced today by Harlow H. Cur-
tice, president of General Motors.
The car is purely an experimental
vehicle, not intended for highway use. It
has been test run at the GM proving
grounds.
The P-21 Firebird, a sleek, white single
seater with aerodynamic styling made
its first public appearance at the GM
Motorama of 1954 in the Waldorf-As-
toria Hotel at New York, January 21-26.
It also will be shown at the GM Motor-
amas to be held later at Miami, Los An-
geles and San Francisco.
Constructed as an experiment to study
future possibilities of the gas turbine for
commercial uses, the XP-21 has under-
gone preliminary tests since last October
at the General Motors Proving Ground
at Milford, Mich., and the GM Desert
Proving Ground near Phoenix, Ariz.
"This experiment is only one part of
an overall General Motors research and
engineering program to examine every
known form of motive power," said Mr.
Curtice.
"The XP-21 is not the car of tomor-
row," he explained. "Actually, it is a
laboratory on wheels built only for the
proving ground and test track, not for
public highways."
"Possibly, this is a development along
a road we may not wish to go, so far as
passenger automobiles are concerned. We
built the Firebird to help us explore com-
mercial possibilities of the gas turbine
and add to our knowledge of thermo-
dynamics," he said.
"The tremendous power and speed po-
tentials of gas turbines are well known by
engineers. However, we are not trying to
develop either overwhelming horsepower
or tremendous speeds in this test car.
Rather, we are trying to determine
whether the turbine can be harnessed to
give efficient and economical performance
in the low and normal automotive driving
ranges," Mr. Curtice explained.
The General Motors president pointed
out that it is customary for GM stylists,
engineers and researchers continuously to
design, build and test "working samples,"
in scanning the automobile's future.
"We do not limit outselves to sketches,
drawings and theories," he declared.
"Our practice is to build something we
are thinking about, test it exhaustively and
find out whether it is practicable."
As typical examples of such GM ex-
periments, Mr. Curtice cited the Train of
Tomorrow (1947) and the automotive
Y-Job (1938), Le Sabre and XP-300
(1951), all of which were built to test
both design and mechanical theories.
The idea of the Firebird originated
with Harley J. Earl, GM vice president in
charge of styling staff, who also designed
its fibre glass reinforced plastic body. The
car's Whirlfire Turbo-Power engine and
the chassis were developed under direc-
tion of GM Vice President Charles L.
McCuen, general manager of GM Re-
search Laboratories Division.
An aircraft motif is evident in the car's
"needle" nose, delta wings swept back
along the rear half of the body, a vertical
tail fin and a plastic bubble over the
driver's cockpit.
Mr. Earl said the design theme was in-
spired by the Navy's experimental plane,
the Skyray.
"We felt," he declared, "that the new
type of power plant could be best symbo-
lized in a new form of experimental car."
"Moreover," he explained, "underlying
the unique styling is a series of special
wind tunnel tests developed at California
Institute of Technology."
He explained that on a vehicle of this
type, completely streamlined, a tail fin or
some flat vertical surface behind the car's
center of gravity is necessary to give the
body directional stability or hold it on
course when it is in motion.
"This becomes particularly important
with an aerodynamic shape such as the
Firebird's contours. To examine this idea
thoroughly, we called on California In-
stitute of Technology to give a scale
model of the car a wind tunnel test."
Mr. McCuen pointed out that automo-
tive turbines have been under develop-
ment at Research Laboratories Division
several years, and this is the first public
showing of progress by GM Research in
this field.
The GM gas turbine car's mechanical
anatomy, the reverse of conventional
automobiles, includes a 35-gallon glass
fiber-plastic fuel tank in the nose ahead
of the driver.

power "package" with an engine con-
sisting of two mechanically independent
parts.
The two parts of the engine are called
the gasifier section and power section.
The gasifier section provides a source of
compressed hot gas, and energy from this
gas is delivered by the power section to
the car's rear wheels.
Thus, the gasifier section replaces the
engine and torque converter pump in a
conventional automobile, while the power
section replaces the torque converter tur-
bine, transmission and fear axle gears.
The Whirlfire gasifier section closely
resembles a complete small jet engine.
The exhaust gas, instead of firing through
a tailcone to propel the car, is funneled
through a power turbine that is directly
connected with the car's rear wheels
through a transmission.
Backbone of the gasifier section is a so-
called compressor rotor and a gasifier tur-
bine wheel, both attached to the same
shaft. Air enters the compressor where its
pressure is raised to more than 3^2 times
atmospheric pressure, before it enters the
engine's two combustion chambers.
Kerosene is burned in these chambers,
raising the gas temperature to approxi-
mately 1500 degrees Fahrenheit.
The hot gas goes through the gasifier
turbine which drives the compressor. The
blast of hot gas from the gasifier is fun-
neled toward the second turbine, the
power section turbine, which is connected
with the car's rear wheels via a two-speed
transmission.
The Firebird's power comes from the
power turbine, rather than the thrust of
exhaust gas through a tailcone, such as
the high velocity thrust that propels a
turbo-jet aircraft. This is the major dif-
ference between an automotive and an air-
craft turbine.
The Whirlfire engine develops 370
horsepower when the gasifier turbine is
spinning at 26,000 r.p.m., and the power
turbine is revolving at 13,000 r.p.m.
Total weight of the engine unit, in-
cluding gasifier and power sections, is
only 775 pounds. Overall weight of the
entire car is 2500 pounds.
This gives the Whirlfire power plant
and drive a weight-to-power ratio of ap-
proximately two pounds per horsepower.
This ratio is about one-third of a con-
ventional piston engine and drive.
The entire engine fits into a space 63
inches long, 26 inches deep and 32 inches
wide.
Meanwhile, the Firebird's overall
length and width compares approximately
with a 1953 Cadillac 62 Special convert-
ible. Overall length is 222.7 inches, as
compared with the Cadillac's 220 11/16,
and its width is 80 inches at its widest
point, the tips of its swept-back delta
wings. It is only 41 inches high at the top
of the plastic bubble over the driver's
cockpit and 55 inches high at the top of
the rear vertical fin.
Wheelbase is 100 inches with 54 inch
front tread and 50-inch rear tread.
The wings have a functional purpose
with their brake flaps on the trailing
edges. They are electrically controlled
from the steering wheel with aircraft type
actuators.
The Firebird's main braking system dif-
fers from conventional design with brake
drums outside rather than inside the
wheels. Location and design of the brakes
facilitate rapid cooling.
The car's suspension also differs com-
pletely with any standard car's suspension
system. GM Research engineers call it
double wishbone front suspension with
torsion bar spring.
They describe the rear suspension as a
deDion type. The axle is suspended with
a single leaf spring and included in the
assembly is a so-called "walking beam"
stabilizer unit.
The car's exhaust outlet resembles the
tailcone of a jet aircraft. It is much larger
than the exhaust of a conventional engine,
a necessity with gas turbines because of
the comparatively large air volume they
swallow, digest and expel.
Mr. Earl suggested the overall Firebird
project while he and Mr. McCuen were
discussing the turbine's possibilities in a
motorcar.
Because the styling involved aero-
dynamics the wind tunnel project on a
model of the contemplated car, using
varying nose and tail fin configurations,
was undertaken with California Institute
of Technology.
Research Laboratories' Gas Turbine de-
partment undertook design and construc-
tion of the power unit, while another GM
Research department, Engineering Me-
chanics, was assigned to the chassis and
suspension system.
A new high temperature alloy develop-
ed by GM Research Metallurgy depart-
ment was used in making both the gasifier
and power turbine blades in the engine.
Engineers in GM Engineering Staff
worked out problems in connection with
the car's special two-speed transmission.
The general order throughout the pro-
gram was for stylists, engineers and re-
searchers not only to draw freely on GM's
vast technical backlog of experience, but
also to pour their most advanced ideas
into the project.
Following a series of dynamometer
run-ins at the GM Turbine Research
building, the engine unit was ready for
assembly with chassis and body.
In October and November the Firebird
was tested at the GM Proving Ground
near Milford, Mich., and in early Decem-
ber it was moved to the Desert Proving
Ground near Phoenix, Ariz., for addi-
tional trial runs.
At the wheel was Mauri Rose, an engi-
neer for Chevrolet Motor Division and
former three-time Indianapolis Speedway
champion. In his trial run Mr. Rose con-
centrated on testing the car's handling
characteristics and controls which re-
quired specialized driving knowhow.
Two-way radio shortwave communica-
tion between engineers and the driver
was set up to check every phase of the
Firebird's performance. To record the
performance were 16 dials, meters and
other indicators on the car's instrument
panel.

AIEE-IRE
One of the outstanding events of last
semester was the color television lecture
and demonstration sponsored by the
AIEE-IRE in the Natural Science Audi-
torium. Over six hundred and fifty people
attended and many more were turned
away. Significant advances, principles, and
techniques of color television were de-
scribed by Cyril N. Hoyler, a member of
the technical staff of the David Sarnoff
Research Center of RCA. Mr. Hoyler
emphasized the RCA system's property of
being received in black-and-white by all
existing television sets—and described
the technical hurdles that were overcome
to create a system of high-quality color
television. He also traced the history of
color television and explained the opera-
tion of RCA tricolor picture tubes,
color television camera, and control equip-
ment.
A vital step in the development of color
television, Mr. Hoyler said, was the
"squeezing" of the complex color signal
in the same 6-megacycle channel used in
today's black-and-white telecasting, with-
out losing any picture quality. This was
achieved in part, he said, by taking ad-
vantage of the fact that the human eye
cannot distinguish colors in fine detail.
Edited by CARLEY CONRAD
For example, a house wife doesn't match
colored threads by single strands; instead,
she must use a whole spool. Thus the
color television signal needs to carry only
as much color information as is required
to produce a pleasing color picture. Both
fine and broad details of a picture are
transmitted in black-and-white, but no
color is added for medium-detail areas
and three-color information is added for
large detail areas. The system uses three
primary colors, red, green, and blue, from
which virtually any desired color can be
electronically mixed.
On December 2, 1953 about eighty
members went on a field trip to Michigan
Bell Telephone Co. in Detroit. The group
left the East Engineering Building at 3:00
P.M. and rode in buses furnished by Bell
Telephone. First was an illustrated lecture
on long distance "toll" dialing, followed
by a discussion of some of the technical
details of the telephone business. Fillet
mignon was served at the banquet dinner.
They inspected the entire facilities of Bell
Telephone; long distance cable room,
local dial equipment, regional dial equip-
ment, and power plant. Then the group
was shown a movie after which there was
a question and answer session.
At another meeting Mr. D. L. Chesnut,
Manager Educational Equipment Division
General Electric Company, gave a talk
on developments in the power field. Re-
cently the AIEE-IRE presented a movie
"Wheels of Tomorrow."
A joint meeting will be held with the
Detroit Section of the Institute of Radio
Engineers March 19, 1954. Mr. Phil H
Rogers, Research Engineer, Electronics
Defense Group, will speak of "Wide-
Band Power Distributed Amplifiers" in
Kellogg Auditorium at 8:00 p.m. Ar-
rangements have been made to hold a din-
ner in one of the private dining rooms at
the Michigan League at 6:30 p.m. Reser-
vations are required. A general descrip-
tion of distributed amplifiers along with a
review of the small signal theory will be
presented. The physical realization of the
circuit components required for band-
widths of the order of 300mc will be dis-
cussed and a distributed amplifier model
will be displayed. The large signal analy-
sis will point out the limitations of the
small signal theory and will indicate the
basic factors involved in the design of
power distributed amplifiers where power
output and efficiency are of prime concern.

FEBRUARY, 1954


By FRANK T. GREENE, '56ChE.
Within the last 50 years, the textile in-
dustry has been undergoing a revolution.
Starting rather slowly about 1900 with the
introduction of rayon, the revolution
slowly picked up momentum with the
increasing acceptance of rayon and its
adaptation to a variety of uses. In the
late 1930's, nylon appeared, to be follow-
ed, at the end of the Second World War,
by a host of new synthetics.
These synthetics are of varied chemical
composition. They may be classified as
follows:
Cellulose derivatives such as viscose
rayon and cellulose acetate.
Polyamides such as "Nylon."
Polyesters such as "Dacron."
Polyacrylic fibers such as "Orion,"
"Dynel," and "Acrilon."
Polyvinylidene chloride fibers such as
"Saran" and "Velon."
Protein fibers such as "Vicara" and
"Caslen."
Glass fibers such as "Fiberglass" and
"Vitron."
Each of the synthetic fibers must go
through a series of general steps in their
preparation. First the polymer must be
prepared, which includes the preparation
and polymerization of the monomer for
a given fiber and of any necessary steps in
purification. In the case of the rayons
(which are sometimes considered semisyn-
thetic fibers since a natural polymer is
used), it consists of the preparation and
purification of the cellulose.
Next the polymer must be transformed
into some sort of a fluid state for spin-
ning. This may be accomplished by either
melting the substance or dissolving it in
a suitable solvent.
The fluid polymer is then forced
through a small orifice to produce a fine
filament, which is precipitated or harden-
ed. After hardening, the filament is
oriented by stretching and wound on
bobbins preparatory to spinning into yarn.
In this report, processes are reviewed
only through the production of the fila-
ment, since from this point on it is largely
the work of a textile engineer. For simi-
lar reasons, the physical properties of the
finished fiber or yarn, as well as develop-
ments in the textile end of the manufac-
turing, are largely ignored. Applications
are reviewed only enough to indicate the
position of the fiber in the country's in-
dustrial and textile picture.
The "Rayons" are the oldest of the
synthetic fibers with commercial produc-
tion dating back to about 1900. These cel-
lulose derivatives were originally sold
as "artificial silk"—a name which implied
that this was an artificial (and presum-
ably inferior) type of fiber and thus
handicapped the growth of the rayon in-
dustry. Also, the silk manufacturers, who
had been meeting fierce competition from
this "artificial silk," claimed that the name
caused confusion. Consequently, the name
was changed in 1929 to "Rayon." Rayon
had become a fiber in its own right.
The conversion of cellulose into staple
fibers or continuous filaments is carried
out by three distinct processes: the viscose
process, the cellulose acetate process, and
the cuprammonium process, which has a
very limited application. The nitrocellu-
lose process was used in this country until

pared with the other three processes and
was discontinued.
The viscose process is the most im-
portant of the three methods in this coun-
try. It is based on the discovery that
alkali cellulose (produced by meceriza-
tion with caustic) will undergo an alcohol
type reaction with carbon bisulfide, pro-
ducing a cellulose xanthate, which is solu-
ble in dilute caustic and can by regener-
ated and precipitated by an acid bath.
The wood pulp used in this process is
purchased in sheets, placed in a steeping
press containing about 19 sections, and
treated with 18% caustic to remove im-
purities and obtain uniform alkali cellu-
lose. Caustic is recovered by dialysis since
the soluble organic impurities cannot be
removed by filtration. The soft cellulose
sheets are then fed into a cellulose shred-
der which breaks the sheets into a finely
divided mass. The cellulose is then allow-
ed to age for several days. At the comple-
tion of the aging, the cellulose is churned
in a baratte with 9% carbon bisulfide by
weight until the reaction is complete.
The cellulose xanthate then is dissolved
in dilute caustic, titanium dioxide is add-
ed as a dulling agent, and the solution is
filtered through a series of filter presses.
The air bubbles are then removed by
vacuum and the solution is allowed to
"ripen." When the solution has acquired
the correct viscosity, it is pumped at a
constant rate through a fine orifice into a
bath containing sulfuric acid, zinc sulfate,
sodium sulfate and glucose, causing the
solution to precipitate regenerated cellu-
lose filaments. The filaments are then
oriented and spun.
The domestic production of viscose
rayon has climbed to over 800 million
pounds of fiber per year and consumed
over 10% of the total chemical output of
the United States (along with viscose
film). Viscose rayon is the cheapest textile
fiber. Each pound requires 1.25 pounds of
wood pulp, 1.60 pounds of caustic soda,
.38 pounds of carbon disulfide, and 1.90
pounds of 60% sulfuric acid.
Viscose rayon is used in women's dress
goods, lingerie, men's neckwear, uphol-
stery, drapery material, suiting fabrics,
and for many other uses.
Recent improvements in the viscose
process include a method of combining
shredding and aging operations, thereby
reducing time required from 2-3 days to
several hours, a method of completing the
deaeration of the final liquor in 2 hours,
and the introduction of continuous shred-
ders.

Figure 2—Viscose Rayon
The cellulose acetate process, though
not as widely used, has become an im-
portant method of the manufacture of
rayon. In this process, acetic anhydride,
glacial acetic acid, and sulfuric acid are
mixed and cooled in a glass lined acetyla-
tor, After the mixture is cooled, the cellu-
lose is added gradually and allowed to re-
act for more than five hours, after which
the mass is diluted with acetic and sul-
furic acids and aged. The acetate is then
precipitated by further dilution with
water. The acetate flakes are then wash-
ed, centrifuged, and dryed on a heated
conveyor belt. The cellulose acetate flakes
are then dissolved in an acetone-water
mixture, any dulling agents or dyes add-
ed, filtered and deaereted several times,
and finally spun into a column of warm
air. The acetone evaporates and leaves the
precipated filament.
The domestic production of cellulose
acetate is well over 100 million pounds
per year. The raw materials required to
produce one pound of cellulose acetate
fibers includes .7 pounds of purified cot-
ton linters, 2.0 pounds acetic anhydride,
3.5 pounds acetic acid, 0.1 pound sulfuric
acid, and 0.2 pounds acetone.
Acetate is characterized by an extreme
softness. It is commonly used, alone or
blended, in clothing and draperies much
as viscose rayon is. Some of the newer
synthetics are eventually expected to cut
into the acetate markets, but acetate is
expected to hold its own fairly well in
blends and because of its low cost (lower

than any other synthetic fiber except vis-
cose rayon.)
Nylon, the next of the synthetic fibers
to be developed, first appeared in the late
thirty's as monofilament bristles, and later,
during the war, developed a wide variety
of uses.
Nylon is any polyamide, usually made
from hexamethylene diamine and adipic
acid. The salt thus formed, on removal of
a molecule of water, yields methylene
adipamide. This is in turn polymerized
and converted into a linear polymer.
In the commercial process, hexamethy-
lene diamine and adipic acid are combined
in fairly dilute aqueous solution to form
a"nylon salt." This solution is then con-
centrated in an evaporator and transferred
to stainless steel autoclaves where poly-
merization takes place. Time, temperature,
pressure, and composition determine the
polymer length. Titanium oxide is added
as a delusterant, and the nylon is cast on
a cooled wheel and chipped off. (Al-
though it would be possible to spin nylon
directly from the autoclave, a much more
uniform product is obtained by blending
batches.) From the chipper, dry nylon
flake is fed through a pressure-high tem-
perature chamber, passed over a number
of liquid finish applicators, and wound
on bobbins. The filaments are later orient-
ed and spun.
Approximately 100 million pounds of
nylon are produced per year. One pound
of nylon requires 0.620 pounds adipic
acid and 0.554 pounds hexamethylene
diamine. Nylon is used in ropes and filter
cloths, for tires, rainwear, a wide variety
of clothing, upholstery and draperies, and
for a number of industrial fabric.
The greatest developmental work being
done on nylon has been directed toward
obtaining hexamethylene diamine from a
cheaper source. A method of preparing it
from oat and rice hulls is being de-
veloped.
The "Sarans," or polyvinylidene chlor-
ide monofilament yarns, have been pro-
duced since 1940. Usually the vinylidene
chloride is copolymerized with 10% vinyl
chloride. The vinylidene chloride is ob-
tained from ethylene and a chloride which
combine to give monomeric vinylidene
chloride. This polymerizes on heating to
give the polyvinylidene chloride, which is
then melted, extruded through an ori-
fice, and air cooled. The monofilament is
then stretched and woven.
The production of "Saran" is between
20 and 30 million pounds per year of
the monofilament. It is being used for

method keeps impurities
down to less than
5 parts in a billion
In this refiving apparatus, at Western Electric'*
Allentown, Pa. plant, germanium is passing through
multiple heating zones in tandem, producing a bar containing
impurities of less than 5 parts in a billion for use in transistors.
Note heating coils on the horizontal quartz tube.
A new method of metal refining, currently in use at the
Western Electric plant at Allentown, results in the pro-
duction of germanium that is better than 99.9999995%
pure — the highest degree of purity ever attained in a
manufactured product.
The need for germanium of such exceptional purity
came about when research by Bell Telephone Labora-
tories in the field of semi-conductors led to the develop-
ment of transistors, which are manufactured by Western
Electric.
The transistor is a tiny crystal device which can amplify
and oscillate. It reduces space requirements and power
consumption to a minimum.
Various forms which germanium takes before being used in tran-
sistors are shown in this photo. Bar at top is an ingot of ger-
manium after reduction from germanium dioxide. Next is shown
the germanium ingot after the zone refining process used by
Western Electric. Below the ingots are shown 3 germanium crys-
tals grown by machine, 6 slices cut from these crystals, and several
hundred germanium wafers ready for assembly into transistors.
Germanium crystals of the size required in transistors
do not occur in nature; they are artificially grown at
Western Electric. At this stage in transistor manufac-
ture, other elements are introduced in microscopic quan-
tities to aid in controlling the flow of electrons through
the germanium. But before these elements can be intro-
duced, it is necessary to start with germanium of excep-
tional purity, so that the impurities will not interfere
with the elements that are deliberately added.
So Bell Telephone Laboratories devised an entirely new
method of purification, known as zone refining, which
was developed to a high-production stage by Western
Electric engineers.
In zone refining a bar of germanium is passed through
a heat zone so that a molten section traverses the length
of the bar carrying the impurities with it and leaving
behind a solidified section of higher purity. By the use
of multiple heating zones in tandem, a number of molten
sections traverse the bar. Each reduces the impurity
content thus producing a bar which contains impurities
in the amount of less than five parts per billion.
Because of the importance of the transistor in elec-
tronics, the zone refining process — like so many other
Western Electric developments — has been made avail-
able to companies licensed by Western Electric to man-
ufacture transistors.
This is one more example of creative engineering by
Western Electric men. Engineers of all skills — mechan-
ical, electrical, chemical, industrial, metallurgical, and
civil — are needed to help us show the way in funda-
mental manufacturing techniques.

screens, upholstery, and related applica-
tions. Work is being done on producing
a filament fine enough to spin into a
multifilament yarn.
Glass fibers were first produced about
1930 and marketed as "glass wool" in
air filters. Recently glass filaments have
been produced which are sufficiently fine
for textile applications.
The glass for fiber production is pro-
duced from a very accurate mixture of
the usual mineral ingredients of glass,
molded into marbles about % of an inch
in diameter and carefully inspected. The
glass is remelted and drawn through small
orifices in a bushing in the bottom of an
electric furnace. The glass is stretched as
it is drawn to a fraction of the diameter
of the orifice. It then is fabricated in the
conventional manner.
Glass fibers are used in a variety of
decorative, fireproof fabrics for draperies,
upholstery, and awnings. It is also used
for paper and tape reinforcements, and
for electrical insulation.
Considerable work has been, and is be-
ing, done on synthetic protein fibers.
Until 1950, fibers were being produced
from soybean protein. For quite some time
casein fiber (caslen) has been used in felt
blends. Zein fiber from corn protein is
now being produced. This latter fiber ap-
pears to be the most promising of the
proteins, although it has been on the
market for only a very short time.
The process for the production of the
zein fiber ("Vicara") is very similar to
that of viscose rayon. A viscous solution
of the powdered zein in water is pre-
pared, uncombined chemicals are removed
by washing, and the solution is aged to
the proper viscosity. This solution is then
spun into an acid bath which precipitates
the zein. The resulting filaments are then
washed and subjected to a number of
after treatments including orientation.
"Vicara" is of considerable value in
blends with wool, cotton, and rayon. It
has been used in a wide variety of men's
and women's clothing. Estimated plant
capacity is 25 million pounds per year.
Several acrylic polymers and copolymers
are now on the market. These include
Dynel, Orion, and Acrilon. Orion and
Acrilon are polyacrylonitriles, while Dynel
is a copolymer of acrylonitrile and vinyl
chloride. The processes for their manufac-
ture are very similar.

acrylonitrile is polymerized in a reactor
under temperature and in the presence of
a suitable catalyst. The polymer is then
blended and dissolved in a suitable sol-
vent, such as dimethyl formamide. The
solution is then filtered and the solution
spun by either the wet or dry process. The
filament is then stretched for orientation.
Orion is too new to have its uses very
clearly defined. It appears to have proper-
ties which will enable it to compete with
wool. Present plant capacity is about 40
million pounds per year.
The newest of the synthetic fibers,
"Dacron" is a polyester of dimethyl tere-
phthalate and ethylene glycol. This fiber
was first produced in 1952.
The dimethyl terephthalate and ethy-
lene glycol are polymerized much as
nylon is and spun from the melt. The fila-
ments are then oriented.
Dacron, like Orion, is too new to have
its uses well defined. It is expected to
compete with wool even more than Orion
and Acrilon. It has an extremely high
wrinkle resistance. Plant capacity is 35
million pounds per year.
These synthetic fibers are competing
very successfully with the natural fibers
and, in some cases, have practically taken
over a particular market: Rayon has re-
placed cotton in tire cords; nylon rope
has beaten out hemp rope in a number of
applications; a majority of the fiber seat
covers are being made from Saran; and
rayon and nylon have practically driven
silk off the market. The synthetics are
here to stay, and the question remains as
to whether the natural fibers can say as
much.
The synthetic fibers have the rather con-
siderable advantage over the natural fibers
of being "economically stable," and in

A major in glibness and a minor in
solid information—those were the
mythical requirements for a sales-
man in the old days. But they really
never sufficed for a man selling the
products of chemical technology.
Today, the diverse applications of
Du Pont's 1200 products and prod-
uct lines create a need for trained
sales personnel representing many
different technical backgrounds.
These men must deal intelligently
with problems in chemistry and en-
gineering applied to such fields as
plastics, ceramics, textiles, and many
others.
Du Pont technical men are as-
signed to various types of technical
sales activity. In some spots they are
equipped to handle all phases of sell-
Technical
Sales
ing. In others they deal mainly with
customer problems. Also, certain de-
partments maintain sales develop-
ment sections, where technical prob-
lems connected with the introduction
of a new product, or a new applica-
tion for an established product, are
worked out.
For example, a technical man in
one of Du Pont's sales groups was
recently called upon to help a cus-
tomer make a better and less expen-
sive hose for car radiators. Involved
were problems in compounding, such
as choice and amount of neoprene,
inert fillers, softeners, accelerators,
and antioxidants. Correct processing
methods also had to be worked out,
including optimum time and tem-
perature of milling and extruding.
The successful completion of this
project naturally gave a good deal
of satisfaction to the customer as
well as Du Pont.
In another case a customer wanted
to reduce carbon contamination of
arc welding rod stock. A Du Pont
technical service man suggested
changes in cleaning procedures that
lowered contamination by 90 per
cent. The new process also reduced
metal loss during heat treatment—a
benefit that more than offset the cost
of the additional cleaning operations.
Technical men interested in sales
work usually start in a laboratory or
manufacturing plant where they can
acquire needed background. Depend-
ing on their interest and abilities,
they may then move into technical
sales service, sales development, or
direct sales.
In any of these fields, the man
with the right combination of sales
aptitude and technical knowledge
will find interesting work, and excep-
tional opportunities for growth in the
Du Pont Company.

many cases they also have an advantage
in price. For instance, "Dacron" staple
sells for about $1.80 per pound while
wool, its chief competitor is about $2.50
per pound. Protein fibers cost l/2 to 1/3
as much as wool. Viscose rayon is the
cheapest synthetic fiber: it undersells cot-
ton by 5c per pound. Nylon is consider-
ably cheaper than silk, and viscose rayon
and acetate are much cheaper.
Potential production of the various
fibers has been indicated along with the
discussion of the fibers and is also in-
cluded in the table. In practically all cases
this is also the estimated production. Exact
production statistics are not available.
Compared with natural fibers, synthetics
have shown a considerable gain. Since
1937, production of fibers has risen 22%
—and synthetics have accounted for 73%
of this "new" market. In 1951, the domes-
tic consumption for fibers was as follows:
1.75 billion pounds of synthetics, in-
cluding rayon.
4.75 billion pounds of cotton.
.66 billion pounds of wool.
Smaller amounts of jute, hemp, linen,
silk, etc.
Little can be said about present research
on synthetic fibers. Although such re-
search is going on continually, it is of a
highly competitive nature and remains
among the best-kept of company secrets,
since often several companies are working
on similar projects. Published develop-
ments are usually concerned with textile
manufacture, rather than fiber production
and development, and are thus of little
interest to the chemical engineer. It is
certain, however, that there are numerous
new fibers in various stages of develop-
ment. The textile revolution is still in
full progress and already well on its way
to the time when fibers will be tailored
for specific uses.

WORLD'S MOST POWERFUL MILITARY RADIO TRANSMITTER
A 6-YEAR NAVY-RCA PROJECTI
On Jim Creek, in the State of Washington, stands the world's
most powerful military radio transmitter—its giant
antenna stretches from mountain peak to mountain peak,
A 6-year project of the Navy and RCA, "Big Jim"
was built and installed to provide the Navy, for
the first time, with instant communications with
naval units everywhere, on the seas and under the
seas, on land and in the air.
Speaking at the dedication ceremonies, Brig. Gen.
David Samoff, Chairman of the Board of RCA, said:
"May I express the wish, which I know all in our
Armed Services share, iliat this powerful instrument
for transmitting intelligence may add to our
national security and to the peace of the world."
The first message flashed by the "Big Jim" trans-
mitter was from Admiral Robert B. Carney, Chief of
Naval Operations, to U. S. Navy personnel around
the world. He said:
"With this message we forge another link between
you and your homeland. With it, we build a new
security channel from America to the naval units
which form its outer ramparts of defense."

A tough Army sergeant, confronted
with a new group of inductees, was par-
ticularly harassed by five college men. At-
tempting to discontinue their annoyances,
he devised an experiment to test their
intelligence. He marched the five men
to the parade grounds and commanded
them into a column with each man facing
in the same direction towards the head
of the column. Upon each man's head the
sergeant placed either a white or a red
hat. Now the men could not see the color
of their own hat, but they could, of
course, see the color of the hats of men
standing in front of them. The sargeant
announced that altogether there were
three red and two white hats.
He first asked the middle man if he
could possibly determine the color of his
own hat to which this man replied nega-
tively. The soldier standing in front of the
middle man was then asked; he also re-
plied that it was impossible for him to
solve the color. When the first man was
questioned, he responded that he knew
the color of his own hat. Assuming that
the first two men questioned by the ser-
geant could not possibly ascertain the
color of their own hat, what was the
color of the hat of the first man and how
did he know?
A man is going hunting and wishes to
take his gun with him on the train. The
ticket agent tells him that he may not
take it in the coach, while the baggage
man will not take it because of its exces-
sive length, (it is a German gun 150 cm.
long over-all) since he is forbidden to ac-
cept for shipment any article whose great-
est dimension exceeds I yard. What
should he do?
Hanging over a pulley there is a rope
with a weight at one end; at the other end
hangs a monkey of equal weight. The
rope weighs four ounces per foot. The
combined ages of the monkey and its
mother are four years and the weight of
the monkey is as many pounds as its
mother is years old. The mother is twice
as old as the monkey was when the
mother was half as old as the monkey
will be when the monkey is 3 times as old
as its mother was when she was 3 times
as old as the monkey was. The weight of
the rope and weight is half as much
again as the difference between the weight
of the weight and the weight of the
weight plus the weight of the monkey.
How long is the rope?
A man has a bushel basket with an egg
in it. Every 60 seconds the quantity of
eggs in the basket is doubled. At the

An honorable family of spiders, con-
sisting of a wise mother and eight husky
youngsters, were perched on the wall at
one end of a rectangular room. Food be-
ing scarce, owing to the Second World
War, they were grumbling, when an
enormous fly landed unnoticed on the op-
posite wall. If Euclid could have been
summoned from his grave (location, alas,
unknown), he would have been able to
show that both the hunters and the prey
were in the vertical plane bisecting the
two opposite walls, the spiders 80 inches
above the center, and the fly 80 inches
below.
Suddenly one young spider shouted
with glee, "Mama! Look! There's a fly!
Let's catch him and eat him!"
"There are four ways to reach the fly.
Which will we take?" came the eager
query from another.
"You have forgotten your Euclid, my
darling. There are EIGHT ways to reach
the fly. Each of you take a different path,
without using any other means of con-
veyance than your God-given legs. Who-
ever reaches the goal first shall be re-
warded with the largest portion of the
prey."
At a signal given by the mother the
8 spiders shot out in eight different direc-
tions at 0.65 mph. At the end of 625/11
seconds they simultaneously converged on
the fly, but found no need of attacking it
since its heart had given way at the sight
of enemies on all sides.

G E Developes Automatic Punch Press
An automatic punch press with an elec-
tronic brain has been developed by Gen-
eral Electric scientists at the company's
Electronics Laboratory at Syracuse, N.Y.,
and its techniques are being adapted to
electronic equipment fabrication under a
U. S. Signal Corps contract.
The machine was described here today
as "one more step toward the automatic-
factory of the future" in a talk and mo-
tion picture presented at an Institute of
Radio Engineers symposium on automa-
tion.
IN THE NEWS
(Continued from page 15)
Directions are fed to the punch press
by an electronic digital computer. The
computer "reads" a perforated card which
has information on size, number and loca-
tion of the holes to be punched. The
punch press automatically positions the
material to be perforated and performs
its punching operations within an ac-
curacy of a few trousands of an inch.
Walter Hausz, a manager in the Labor-
atories Department of G-E's Electronics
Division, said the automatic punch press
is a by-product of development work be-
ing done by Syracuse scientists under con-
tract with the Signal Corps.
This contract calls for the development
of a system of automatic machinery to as-
semble and test electronic circuit sub-
assemblies for various military electronic
equipment, Hausz explained.
The G-E scientist described the auto-
matic punch press as the forerunner to an
assembly machine to be used in the auto-
matic assembly system being developed
for the Signal Corps. The Signal Corps
support of this automatic factory pro-
gram is base on the recognized need for
vastly expanded electronic production to
meet the anticipated demand in case of
emergencies.
He said the standard turret-type punch
press was made automatic primarily as a
proving ground for techniques and com-
ponent elements to be embodied in the
assembly machine.
Hausz also explained that a version of
the punch press could be used to punch

preparation of these boards for the place-
ment of various components by the auto-
matic assembly system.
The punch press will be removed from
the laboratory in the near future, Hausz
said, and will be placed in a factory for
further development and experimental use-
to determine if it is a practical means for
increasing worker productivity in other
areas.
He pointed out that the techniques em-
ployed to make the punch press perform
automatically may well be applied to a
number of other industrial operations.
Hausz said these include drilling, rivet-
ing, stapling, electrical testing, and many
others.
According to Hausz, the automatic as-
sembly system being developed for the
Signal Corps will place from 10 to 50
standard components, such as resistors
and sub-miniature tubes, on printed wir-
ing boards at a rate of 30 per minute.
This rate can be increased on any one
production line by using additional place-
ment machines. The final system also will
provide for preparation and testing of
components, for transporting them to the
assembly machine, and for soldering and
testing the completed sub-assemblies.
The entire system, scheduled for com-
pletion in 1955, will be supervised elec-
tronically by means of perforated cards,
which will contain the various program-
ming information.
Hausz emphasized that the automatic
assembly system is not intended to pro-
duce completed products such as radar or
television sets, but will produce printed
circuit sub-assemblies for electronic equip-
ment. The sub-assemblies will be manu-
ally combined into complete products,
until other machines may be devised to
perform the task.
The military services are particularly
interested in sub-assembly type electronic
equipment for maintenance reasons,
Hausz explained. Faulty sub-assemblies
are easy to locate and replace. They might
be discarded at little cost, or can be re-
paired.
Hausz said General Electric has deter-
mined the kind of system needed to per-
form the job outlined by the Signal Corps,

Rollpin is a hollow, split, cylindrically formed pin with chamfered
ends. It is simply driven into holes drilled to normal production toler-
ances. Because Rollpin is slightly larger than standard sized holes,
it compresses as inserted. It is self-locking—and vibration-proof—
because of the constant pressure it exerts against hole walls. Its shear
strength exceeds that of a cold rolled pin of the same diameter. Rollpin
is readily removed with a drift or pin punch—and can be reused.
Because of its versatility—and the production economies it makes
possible—Rollpin is finding wide usage in almost every phase of manu-
facturing activity. Write for design information on the Rollpin. It will
enable you to cut costs for many applications where use of rivets, set

Last December the Nuclear Energy Committee of the AIChE
reorganized as a Nuclear Engineering Division with a con-
stitution permitting other than chemical engineers to join
the new division. Professor Donald L. Katz, Chairman of
the Engineering College's Chem. Engineering Department,
is chairman of this new Division and Professor J. J. Martin,
also of the Chem. Engineering Department, is Secretary-
treasurer. Dean L. M. K. Boelter of the University of Cali-

Executive Committee include Dr. Alberto F. Thompson of the
Atomic Energy Commissian at Washington; Mr. Clark Center
of the Carbide and Carbon Chemicals Corporation at Oak
Ridge; and Dr. Walter H. inn, Director of the Argonne Na-
tional Laboratory. The new division already has over 250
members. It has a real opportunity to pioneer in the organiza-
tion of technical meetings and dissemination of information
on atomic energy.
Some months ago, consideration was given to having an
Atomic Exposition at the University in connection with the
Nuclear Engineering Congress. Permission was obtained from
the Atomic Energy Commission for such an exh/'bition. It is
hoped that arrangements can be made for a goodly number
of exhibitors to present educational exhibits on products and
services in the field of atomic energy.
Dr. R. R. White of the Chemical Engineering Department
is Chairman of the Committee on Local Arrangements co-
ordinating the efforts of the University of Michigan, the
American Institute of Chemical Engineers national office, and
the Detroit Local Section of the AIChE. Such items as regis-

distributed through their members as well as others indicating
an interest. Invitations will be issued to members of other
technical societies interested in atomic energy.
Since the University of Michigan is in the process of build-

electronic equipment to dictate action to
the machines, and various component

Hausz said the automatic component
assembly system would make its greatest
contribution "in improved automation of
the small quantity production typical of
many military products and specialized
commercial lines such as radio and tele-
vision transmitters and studio equipment,
and microwave communication equip-
ment."
He explained that while much effort
has been applied to the automatic pro-
duction of electronic equipment to be
made by the hundreds or thousands, ef-
forts to increase productivity of job
shops have been lacking.
"A prime requirement for automation
of small quantity production, either of
electronic assemblies or metal working
operations, is flexibility," Hausz said.
IN THE NEWS
(Continued from page 34)
"Flexibility," he explained, "to change
what is being made with the minimum of
down-time on the equipment, with the
minimum of set-up skill required, with
the minimum investment of time and
money in tools, jigs, fixtures and other an-
cillary items pertinent only to one particu-
lar product."
The automatic component assembly sys-
tem G-E is developing for the Signal
Corps is being designed for the greatest
possible flexibility. A change can be made
in the sub-assembly the system is produc-
ing merely by punching new directions
on a new program card. No retooling or
operator training time would be required,
Hausz said.
Hausz said that in industries presently
studied, 75 per cent of the metal working
operations are in job lots of from 10 to
50.
Because of the higher unit cost of such
job lots, it is probable that their total
value greatly exceeds that of metal work-
ing operations for mass produced goods,
he said.

Hafnium Oxide—Its Role in Zircon
and Zirconia Refractories
For some thirty years, a mystery has
surrounded hafnium oxide and the role
that it plays in zircon and zirconia re-
fractories at high temperatures. Recent
studies undertaken by the Ceramics De-
partment of Oak Ridge National Labora-
tory, Oak Ridge, Tennessee, operated by
Union Carbide for the Atomic Energy
Commission, however, are beginning to
shed some light on the properties of this
compound.
The element hafnium was discovered
by Hevesy in the early 1920's, and its
chemical and spectrographs properties
were determined shortly after Hevesy
found hafnium occurring in proportions
of 0.5 to 4.0 per cent in zircon (zircon-
ium silicate), which has since become im-
portant as a refractor)'. For example, it
finds application in the melting of glass
and aluminum. Zirconium oxide is pro-
duced from zircon and is important as a
furnace lining where temperatures of
1800 to 2400 degrees Centigrade are en-
countered. For use in refractories, zir-
conium oxide has to be "stabilized" to
overcome crystal inversions that cause
shattering. "Stabilization" consists in
heating the material with 3.0 to 8.0 per
cent of calcium oxide or magnesium
oxide, whereby a stable cubic-crystal phase
is formed by solid solution.
In all of these uses and operations,
there are one-half to three pounds of
hafnium present in some form in each
100 pounds of refractory, but what its
effect may be has not been previously de-
termined. The reason lies in the unusually
close resemblance between hafnium and
zirconium in chemical properties, which
in turn is due to the fact that their outer
electron shells are identical. Consequently,
the separation of the elements is so labor-
ious and costly that only a few grams of
hafnium had been isolated. It is known
that zirconium oxide and hafnium oxide
have monoclinic crystal lattices which are
practically identical in size, and that their
melting points are in the neighborhood
of 2800 degrees Centigrade, and within
100 degrees Centigrade of each other.
Then recent processes developed at Oak
Ridge National Laboratory enabled the
Ceramics Department to obtain possession
of quantities of pure hafnium oxide and
hafnium-free zirconium oxide. Advantage

• Even before he was graduated from
the U. of Kentucky, Sam Griffin, Jr.
was "sold" on a job at Allison. His
brother-in-law, who is in Allison air-
craft engine test section, had told him
about the many advantages and op-
portunities offered the young engi-
neer with academic training like his.
So, when Sam left school in 1951
with his B.S. in Metallurgical Engi-
neering, he came right to Allison
where he is now Experimental Metal-
lurgist in Transmissions Operations.
Allison, along with its aircraft en-
gine activity and production of bear-
ings and Diesel locomotive parts, is
the world's largest manufacturer of
Torqmatic Drives for heavy duty
Ordnance and commercial vehicles
and equipment. In all parts of the
world, Torqmatic Drives are in use
today in big trucks . . . tractors . . .
cranes . . . shovels . . . tanks .. . drill-
ing rigs . . . and scrapers.
After Engineering designs a part,
such as—let's say—a spur gear, know-
ing what it must do, and the hardness
required to do its specific job, it's up
to the metallurgists to select a steel
and heat treatment to meet the speci-
fications. That's an important respon-
sibility in the Allison Transmissions
operations where as many as 700
different parts go through heat treat.
Proper control here means less re-
work, and when the perfect surface
is produced, the part is "ready to go,"
without grinding.
Sam has been doing pioneering
work in heat treatment control with
newly-installed equipment at Allison.
He is shown above, as final tests are
being made, at the panel of the Dew
Point Recorder which checks the
amount of moisture in heat treat fur-
naces. Twenty-four big furnaces are
controlled by these two- six-station
machines. It was his responsibility
to see that the equipment was in-
stalled properly, and he also trains
personnel in the proper use of the
equipment.
The long range program at Allison
offers unlimited opportunities to com-
petent graduate engineers in various
fields. Why not plan early for your
engineering career at Allison.

was taken by the department's staff mem-
bers of this unique opportunity to clarify
some of the mysteries that have hitherto
surrounded hafnium oxide and its prop-
erties.
The Ceramics Department is part of
the ORNL Metallurgy Division, and is
playing an important role in the rapidly
expanding field of ceramic applications to
nuclear reactor requirements. The Labora-
tory is a leader in the field of reactor de-
velopment and technology.
The Ceramics Department's tests show-
ed that, with one important exception,
the resemblance of hafnium to zirconium
continues in high-temperature applica-
tions. For instance, the X-ray patterns of
the oxides can scarcely be distinguished
from each other. The interplanar dis-
tances in hafnium oxide are smaller by 1
per cent.
Both oxides react with silica in a solid-
state reaction at approximately 1500 de-
grees Centigrade in a one-to-one molecu-
lar ratio to form a compound called zir-
con, in the one case, and "hafnon" in the
other. The silicates are nearly identical in
crystal symmetry, X-ray, properties, and
thermal expansion.
Hafnium oxide also is similar to zir-
conia in its reactions with calcium oxide;
with from 3 to approximately 40 per cent
of calcium oxide present, the monoclinic
lattice of hafnia is transformed to a face-
centered cubic crystal form in a solid-state
reaction at temperatures between 1600
and 1800 degrees Centigrade. This means
that, when zirconia is stabilized for re-
fractory use, the hafnia is also stabilized.
Additions of over 40 per cent calcium
oxide produces calcium zirconate in one
case and calcium hafnate in the other.
These also closely resemble each other in
crystal structure, size, and thermal expan-
sion; as usual, interplanar distances in the
hafnium compound are generally 1 per
cent smaller than in calcium zirconate.
The notable exception to this similarity
of behavior was found in the range of
temperatures over which hafnium oxide
and zirconium oxide are stable. The
monoclinic lattice of zirconia undergoes
an inversion at 1000 degrees Centigrade
to a tetragonal form, and this change is
accompanied by a large shrinkage in vol-
ume. The inversion is completely revers-
ible, so that zirconia refractories tend to
shatter if they are heated and cooled re-
peatedly. On the other hand, it was found
that hafnium oxide remains in the mono-
clinic form up to 1700 degrees Centi-
grade, where an inversion takes place.
Whether the inverted form is tetragonal,
as in the case of zirconia, has not yet been
established. However, it appears that the
inversion is not accompanied by as mark-
ed a volume change as is undergone by
zirconia.
It is possible therefore, to assure users
of zircon and zirconia refractories that the
hafnium content of these materials is ex-
erting no harmful effect. Rather, in view
of the greater temperature stability of the
hafnium oxide lattice and its slightly
higher melting point, it might be desir-
able to seek as high a hafnium content as
possible.

Electronic Brain Opens Future
for Mechanical Translators
Russian was translated into English by
an electronic "brain" recently for the first
time.
Brief statements about politics, law,
mathematics, chemistry, metallurgy, com-
munications and military affairs were sub-
mitted in Russian by linguists of the
Georgetown University Institute of Lan-
guages and Linguistics to the famous 701
computer of the International Business
Machines Corporation. And the giant
computer, within a few seconds, turned
the sentences into easily readable English.
A girl who didn't understand a word
of the language of the Soviet punched
out the Russian message on IBM cards.
The "brain" dashed off its English trans-
lation on an automatic printer at the
breakneck speed of two and a half lines
per second.
"Mi pyeryedayem mislyi posryedstvom
ryechyi," the girl punched. And the 701
responded: "We transmit thoughts by
means of speech."
"Vyelyichyina ugla opryedyelyayetsya
otnoshyenyiyem dlyini dugi k radyiusu,"
the punch rattled. The "brain" came back:
"Magnitude of angle is determined by the
relation of length of arc to radius."
"Myezhdunarodnoye ponyimanyiye yav-
lyayetsya vazhnim faktorom v ryeshyenyiyi
polyityichyeskix voprosov," the girl tap-
ped out. And the computer translated:
"International understanding constitutes
an important factor in decision of politi-
cal questions."
More than sixty Russian sentences were
given to the "brain" altogether. All were
translated smoothly in a demonstration
performed jointly by Georgetown and
IBM as a phase of IBM's endowed re-
search in computation.
A handful of men had been individu-
ally engaged in research at various institu-
tions for almost a decade to make a
machine convert the meaning of words
clearly from one language to another. No
practical results were achieved until
Georgetown a year and a half ago en-
listed the aid of the most versatile elec-
tronic "brain" extant, the 1MB 701.
This amazing instrument was inter-
rupted in its 16-hour-a-day schedule of
solving problems in nuclear physics,
rocket trajectories, weather forecasting
and other mathematical wizardry. Its at-
(Continued from page 40)
tention was turned at brief intervals from
these lightninglike numerical calculations
to the altogether different consideration of
logic in an entirely new and strange realm
for giant electronic data processing ma-
chines: the study of human behavior—
specifically, the human use of words. The
result, as publicly proved today, was an
unqualified success.
"The potential value of this experiment
for the national interest in defense or in
peace is readily seen," Prof. Leon Dostert,
Georgetown language scholar who origi-
nated the practical approach to the idea of
electronic translation, declared to a group
of scientists and United States govern-
ment officials who witnessed the demon-
stration at IBM World Headquarters,
57th Street and Madison Avenue.
"Those in charge of this experiment
now consider it to be definitely established
that meaning conversion through elec-
tronic language translation is feasible."
Although he emphasized that it is not
yet possible "to insert a Russian book at
one end and come out with an English
book at the other," Doctor Dostert pre-
dicted that "five, perhaps three years
hence, interlingual meaning conversion by
electronic process in important functional
areas of several languages may well be an
accomplished fact.
Silicone Rubber Finds Use in Jets
Super-Tough Silicone Rubber, aptly-
named because its tear strength averages
190 pounds per square inch, has been de-
veloped by the General Electric Company
for aircraft, chemical processing and simi-
lar rugged applications.
Available in grades 15060, 15080 and
15081, the new elastomer's tear strength
is 2 to 3 times higher than any other
silicone rubber now on the market. Super-
Tough has been put into production by
G.E.'s Plastics Department to provide in-
dustry with a material that has the best
thermal properties of silicones, but with
greater tear strength and oil resistance.
G-E engineers said Super-Tough has
successfully survived rigorous flight tests
in jet engines and other aircraft equip-
ment. "O" rings and gaskets, made from
this type rubber, have proved satisfactory
as seals for synthetic base oils at tempera-
tures as high as 375 F. Super-tough is also
recommended for molded ducts and con-
nectors for hot air lines, particularly
where oil mist is present.
In addition to aviation applications,
Super-Tough is expected to find wide-
spread use as a gasketing material in
chemical processing equipment, where
high temperatures, pressure, or vacuum
exist.
Grade 15081 was described as having
very low compression set properties and
all grades of Super-Tough are said to have
excellent resistance to both heat and cold.
Flexibility is maintained over a range of
minus 65 F to 550 F.
All grades of Super-Tough Silicone
rubber are available in molded form from
the Division's Plastics Department plant
at Decatur, Illinois.
First Pictures of Atomic Engine
On May 31, 1953, the first atomic en-
gine in the nation's history turned the
propeller shaft of a "dry land submarine"
built in the middle of an Idaho desert.
This history-making engine, built by
Westinghouse Electric Corporation under
contract with the Atomic Energy Commis-
sion and in cooperation with the AECs
Argonne National Laboratory, was the
land-based prototype or experimental
model (Mark I) of the nuclear power
plant (Mark II) that will propel the first
atomic submarine, U.S.S. Nautilus.
The Nautilus was launched on January
21, 1954, by the Electric Boat Division of
General Dynamics Corporation at Groton,
Conn.
The desert-bound atomic engine is a
full sized power plant installed inside two
sections of a submarine hull. The reactor
compartment is surrounded by its own
private ocean—a large sea tank full of
water.
The second atomic engine, Mark II,
also built by Westinghouse, will make
the Nautilus an around-the-world sub-
marine, capable of cruising submerged
great distances at speeds above 20 knots.

HOW TO CUT COSTS
WITH WELDED
PRODUCT DESIGN
IOW manufacturing costs are a
j "must" in today's product plan-
ing. As a result, every engineer must
know, above all, how to eliminate
needless cost in machine designs.
First consideration in designing
machinery must be the material used.
Steel is three times stronger, twice
as rigid as cast iron, yet costs only a
third of the price of gray iron.
That's why machine parts built
with welded steel designs often cost
50% less to produce.
Fig. 1. Original construction of gear case
cover weighed 66 pounds... required milling
of bottom edge/or oil-tight seal with gear case.
Fig. 2. Steel designed gear case cover
now used weighs only 10pounds... costs half

project, says that the year was the "great-
est since the Phoenix Project was launch-
ed." He cites the following accomplish-
ments for the University's war memorial
program, which is dedicated to making
the atom work as effectively for peace as
it has in wartime destruction:
1. More funds were assigned to re-
search than in any previous year. Fifty-
three research projects are now in prog-
ress.
2. The most powerful source of gamma
radiation (10 kilocurie of Cobalt 60)
available in any non-governmental lab-
oratory was acquired.
3. Construction was started on the
Alice Lloyd Radiation Therapy Labora-
tory, in which the effectiveness of Cobalt
600 and Cesium 137 in treating cancer
will be studied.
4. Plans were completed for the
$1,200,000 Phoenix Memorial Laboratory,
and its construction will start in March
on the new North Campus.
5. A gift of $1,000,000 was received
from the Ford Motor Company Fund for
the construction of a nuclear research
reactor. "When the reactor is finished
and in operation, the University will have
the most complete and balanced set of
intense-radiation sources now available:
the reactor and the 10 kilocurie cobalt
source of the Phoenix Project, and the
synchrotron and cyclotran of the physics
department," Dean Snyder said.
6. The $6,500,000 campaign goal of
the project was surpassed, and the total is
now over $7,400,000.
Turning to the research field, Dean
Sawyer's report lists these developments
which hold hope for the future:
1. Preliminary tests with radioactive
iron indicate the possibility of applying
essential inorganic materials directly to
the leaves of plants. This technique would
be helpful in areas of sandy soils. Other
materials will be tried.
2. A two-year study has been launched
on the problem of whether day-by-day
eating of irradiated food might produce
some immediately harmful effects or some
hereditary results. It already has been
found that food can be preserved by
irradiation. Three groups of rats are being
used in the test. One receives only non-
irridiated food, another only fully irra-
diated food, and the third group gets
some of both kinds of food. To date all
three groups appear to be thriving equally
well.
3. Preliminary estimates on the cost of
using irradiation commercially to sterilize
trichina larvae in a hog carcass are en-
couraging. The cost studies are being
made in the Fission Products Laboratory,
a joint facility of the Proenix Project and
the Atomic Energy Commission. There are
indications that the irradiation technique,
which was included in the 1952 report of
the Phoenix Project, will be an entirely
practical method for the control of trichi-
nosis, a widespread disease.
4. Placing a strong source of radioac-
tive gold in the burner of a jet engine has
been found to increase the engine output
by as much as 10 per cent.
5. Research was launched on the role
of pituitary hormones as a protection
against damage to the human body from
the effects of radiation. Rats from which
the pituitary glands had been removed
were found to have a lower survival rate
than normal rats exposed to radiation.
6. Nearing completion in the area of
genetics is a study that may have some
bearing on the problem of cancer. Auto-
radiography techniques have been used in
the study of melanin—the black pigment
of hair, eyes, skin moles, etc.—and the
identification of the "building materials"
from which it is formed. Detailed infor-
mation on melanin formation under nor-
mal conditions, it is hoped, may make it
possible to determine the changes from
normal which lead to melanoma, a partic-
ularly malignant form of cancer involving
formation of abnormal amounts of
melanin.
7. Carbon-14 is being used as a tracer
in a new search for the cause of arthritis.
The Phoenix Project is cooperating with
the Rackham Arthritis Research Unit of
the University Hospital in a study of the
nature, behavior and chemical composition
of the mucopolysaccharides, the material
of the connective tissue which determines
the characteristics of the fluids in the
joints.
8. Two new methods of detecting
radiation have been developed. One uses
super-heated liquids, and the other a
beta-ray microscope. The microscope will
speed up and amplify radioactive tracer
studies in the fields of biology and metal-
lurgy, since it permits direct and instan-
taneous study of the areas where the iso-
topes have been deposited. Autoradio-
graphy, used previously, was accurate and
sensitive, but rather slow and compli-
cated.

YOUR BEARING NOTEBOOK
How engineers designed .0002"
accuracy into a gear shaver table
To get the high accuracy necessary in gear shaving
operations, engineers had to have extreme spindle
rigidity. If the spindle could be held rigid, it would
eliminate chatter and vibration. To get this rigidity,
engineers mounted the table spindle of this gear shaver
on Timken® tapered roller bearings. The result—a
measurement of this gear shaver's accuracy showed a
maximum runout of .0002", exceptional in view of the
fact that these bearings have 11 Yt" and 16H" bores.
How TIMKEN bearings hold
spindles in rigid alignment
Deflection is minimized, end-play and chatter
eliminated because the tapered construction of
Timken bearings enables them to take any com-
bination of radial and thrust loads. Line contact
between rollers and races gives spindles wide
support for extra rigidity.

At time t equals zero there lived in a
small cavity in a dielectric a poor strug-
gling dipole by the name of Eddy Cur-
rent. He was deeply in love with a beau-
teous double layer by the name of Anne
Ion, the daughter of an influential force
in the town, Cat Ion. Anne was the cen-
ter of attraction of the young dipoles of
the town; her golden curls, her simple
harmonic motion affected the susceptibili-
ties of all the gay sparks. However, her
father, rich magnet and power factor,
had laid down a strict set of boundary
conditions for her future husband. Eddy's
first contact with her came at the time t
equals a. As he passed by a beauty parlor
on his periodic orbit, he saw her having a
standing wave induced in her filaments.
He made a fine sight in his beautiful
doublet and it was a case of mutual polar-
ization.
By a coincidence they met at a dissipa-
tion function the following night. After a
few oscillations to the strains of a number
(n) by Mo Mentum and his incandescent
Tuning Forks, the couple diffused into the
field outside. There on the Wheatstone
Bridge, the young dipole felt his big mo-
ment had arrived.
"Gauss, Anne, you are acute angle. I
am d(termined) that U shell marry me
for I sphere I will never be happy with-
out you."
"Oh, Eddy, don't be so obtuse," said
Anne. "Integrate out here in the alpha
rays tonight."
"Anne, are you trying to dampen my
oscillations? Can't you see I am in a state
of hysteresis over you?"
"Now, Eddy, be a discreet particle.
What will father say?"
Eddy did not allow her reluctance to
phase him, for he knew it was only
a surface charge. "I admit I only get
paid a low calorie in my present position,
but I have potentialities, and I am sure
that money cannot B.T.U. of any impor-
tance compared to my love."
Alas, there was also in this cavity a
mean dipole who was resolved to marry
the beauteous Anne, using coercive force
if necessary. Hearing these murmurings
of love, he went Pi-i'd with fury and
crept stealthfully upon the couple with
velocity (V), his joules drooling with the
bestial erg which moved him. "Low
Schmidt!" cried Anne.
"What the infra red are you doing
here, you flat-bottomed vial villain?" de-
manded Eddy. The situation grew tensor.
Schmidt advanced to chose the beauti-
ful coid. Eddy offered resistance (R) ; his
capacity (C) for absorbing the charge
(Q) was low and Schmidt suffered little
lost work content in knocking him out to
infinity with a severe blow on his nega-
tive charge. Eddy made a quick comeback
with acceleration (a) stripping off
Schmidt's outer electrons; this so upset
the villain's equilibrium that he was con-
verted into cosmic radiation and vanished
in the realms of space, leaving Eddy the
resultant vector in the combat.
Old Cat Ion, attracted to the spot by
Schmidt's emission, beamed upon the
young dipole. "Brave young lad," he
hummed, "You have satisfied the bound-
ary conditions and by the Theorem of
Uniqueness are the only one for my
daughter."
"Our love will not be transient," said
Eddy as he formed a closed circuit about
her.
"Darling, wc will raise a one parameter
family of second order infinitesimals,"
murmured Anne happily. As time t ap-
proached infinity, they live happily.

The day after finals, a disheveled

"Yeah," agreed the student, "Do you
have a match?"
The ship was sinking, and the Captain
called all hands aft. "Who among you can

"I can," replied the ensign.
"Then pray, shipmate," ordered the
Captain. "The rest of you put on life-

don't imagine we have many lawyers among our readers,
engineers will read this also. But, remember: this is
addressed to the lawyers.
Please, fellas, not like last year. Fun is fun and
rivalry is great but this year we want a peaceful, sub-
dued Slide Rule Ball, not a brawl. Last year we slipped
a delegation into the Law Quad and swiped back our
giant slide rule that you had swiped from us in '52 and
we hung it over the door in the League ballroom for our
dance. Well, you stormed the dance about 10:30 and
we fought you for the slide rule until it was utterly de-
molished and until Professor Menefee's ankle was broken
and until the dance was just about ruined. The whole
affair made us a little bitter and we don't want to see
it happen again. So, please fellas, lay off the dance.
I think I can speak for the engineers when I say that
we will meet you in any sort of a contest or competition
from chug-a-lugging Mount Clemens water to hugging
Kodiak bears to prove our virility. If you are sufficiently
interested I'm sure some such contest can be arranged.
But let's have it now, before the weekend of the dance.
Let's get it all out of our systems. Please, no more Slide
Rule Brawls.

fire
at two
chemical
plants
One plant is a seething inferno. Several persons were
injured in this mid-western chemical plant fire, which
resulted in a 8600,000 loss.
How different the story at the other chemical plant. When
fire broke out at Arnold Hoffman &amp; Company, Inc.,
Dighton, Mass., there was no rapid spread of flames. No
one was injured. The blaze was confined to a single area
of the plant and the damage was negligible.
What did the Arnold Hoffman plant have which the
other chemical plant didn't have? The protection of a
Grinnell Automatic Sprinkler System!
Grinnell Sprinklers stop fire at its source, wherever and
whenever it strikes, night or day, with automatic certainty.
Seventy-six years experience proves this.
Best of all, the new Grinnell Automatic Spray Sprinklers
offer far more efficient water distribution — less water puts
out more fire. Grinnell Automatic Spray Sprinklers are
interchangeable, moreover, with existing sprinklers with-
out piping changes.
A Grinnell Sprinkler System often pays for itself in a few
years through reductions in insurance premiums. That's
why any company that has fire insurance is already, in
effect, paying for the protection of a Grinnell Sprinkler
System. Why not have it? Grinnell Company, Inc., 260

There's plenty of "head room" for you at Boeing
If you arc a senior in any field of en-
gineering, it would be advisable to
consider the advantages of a career at
Boeing after you graduate.
Boeing, for instance, makes a policy
of "promoting from within." Regular
merit reviews give you steady opportu-
nity and recognition. And in a com-
pany with a growth record like Boeing's,
there's always plenty of "head room" to
move into.
Another advantage at Boeing is career
stability. Boeing has grown practically
continuously during its 37 years of op-
eration. Today Boeing actually employs
more engineers than even at the peak
of World War II.
Still another Boeing advantage is
the variety of experience and contacts
available to you here. Boeing is con-
stantly alert to new materials and tech-
niques, and approaches them without
limitations. Extensive subcontracting
and major procurement programs —all
directed by engineers — give you con-
tacts with a cross section of American
industry. Aviation, in fact, is unique
in its variety and breadth of application
— from applied research to production
design, all going on at once.
At Boeing you'd work in Seattle,
Washington, or Wichita, Kansas — two
fresh, modern cities with a wide variety
of recreational facilities, fine shopping
and residential districts, and universities
which provide excellent graduate study
courses. The company will arrange a
reduced work week to permit time for
this study and will reimburse tuition
upon successful completion of each
quarter's work.
There arc openings in all branches
of engineering (mechanical, civil, elec-
trical, aeronautical, and related fields)
for DESIGN, PRODUCTION AND
RESEARCH. Also for servo-mecha-
nism and electronics designers and ana-
lysts, and physicists and mathematicians
with advanced degrees.

FOR ENGINEERING GRADUATES
By H. C. McDANIEL, Manager Technical Publicity and
C. A. SCARLOTT, Editor Westinghouse Engineer
There are many editor-writer oppor-
tunities for the young engineer who has a
desire to interpret in a form usable by his
profession, the significance of engineer-
ing developments. The opportunities lead
in two directions: one to the technical
periodical publishing business; the other
to public relations work in industry. Both
have the advantage of offering a con-
tinuing education in engineering as the
successful editor-writer visits plants where
things are made and is brought into inti-
mate contact with people who design and
make these things.
The job of reducing to usable form
newly-found knowledge is as important
as the discovery itself. Unless the signifi-
cance of the discovery can be explained
to others, that new knowledge cannot be
put to use by the profession generally. So,
the need for competent engineering edi-
tor-writers increases with each new branch
that is added to the engineering family
tree. Of significance also is the fact that
pay is comparable to that for engineering
work while the opportunities for ad-
vancement are equal to those in any pro-
fession.
The qualifications needed for this work
can be summed up in seven words: Engi-
neering education; Journalistic skill;
Imagination; Diplomacy; and Coopera-
tiveness.
What you should look for and what
you need to know about these job oppor-
tunities, where to look for this informa-
tion, who to get in touch with, and how
to write that letter of application are cov-
ered in detail in this article.
Opportunities in the Technical
Periodical Publishing Business
There are nearly 2000 periodicals pub-
lished in the United States aimed at 150
different fields of interest in industry and
business. A detailed analysis of the edi-
torial content and the readership of each
of these magazines can be found in "The
Editorial Directory" or "The Standard
Rate &amp; Data Service-Business Publications
Edition." The former is published by the
Galub Publishing Company, New York
City; the latter by Standard Rate &amp; Data
Service, Evanston, Illinois.
In addition, there are some 1500
periodicals published by industry itself
that are aimed at this same group of in-
dustrial and business readers. The edi-
torial analysis of this group of publica-
tions is to be found in "The Nation's
Leading House Magazines," published by
the Gebbie Press, New York City.
Study these volumes. As you do, make
a list of the magazines you think you
might like to work for. Read several issues
of each magazine on your list. Note first
the number of people on the editorial
staff—the larger the staff the greater the
opportunity to break into the field and
get some experience.
Next, study the table of contents and
note especially the type and kind of fea-
ture articles carried. Also, the depart-
ments: Operating Shorts, Maintenance
Pointers, Kinks, How-To, Ideas of the
Month, etc. As you leaf through the
magazine notice the number of by-lined
feature articles compared to the staff-
written features. This is your tip-off to
the time spent editing other people's writ-
ing to that of researching, gathering data
and writing the article yourself. Scan the
news items, new products, and new ma-
terials items to get the feel of this end of
the book.
Finally, study the advertising carefully.
Note specifically the products advertised
for this is your cue to the readership; the
tip-off to the kind of industries and busi-
nesses you'd be associated with if you
worked for that magazine.
The name and title of each person on
the staff is found on the masthead. Here
is what each does: the publisher is
charged with the responsibility of making
the magazine pay, therefore, has under
him a business staff and an editorial staff.
The former sells advertising space while
the latter develops and produces the edi-
torial copy.
The editor—who reports to the pub-
lisher—is responsible for setting the edi-
torial policy and philosophy and with the
publisher, of determining the editorial
diet. The managing editor—who reports
to the editor—sees to it that copy is in on
time and that the magazine is printed and
mailed on schedule. The technical, asso-
ciate, and assistant editors must line up
articles that have been scheduled for pub-
lication during the course of the year,
must get these articles written on time,
and must edit them for publication. In
addition, they are frequently assigned to
do a staff story.
As a cub editor, you start your career
writing and editing "news" and "what's
new" items. As you gain experience, de-
velop a feel for your readers, and become
more facile with words, you'll find your
assignments becoming more interesting;
more stimulating; more challenging. As-
suming you'll continue to do what's ex-
pected of you, you'll find from that point
on—usually a period of two to four years
—that your responsibilities will increase,
your progress will be forward, and your
pay will move upward.
In general, staff editors of scientific
society journals and of engineering asso-
ciation magazines do not have the free-
dom and latitude for editing that an edi-
tor has on a technical or trade magazine.
There are notable exceptions to this gen-
eral rule and you can spot these the mo-
ment you read the introductory paragraph
to one of the articles or papers. Where
editing is restricted by rules, the oppor-
tunity to flex your imagination and to de-
velop an articulate writing style is in-
hibited, but there are compensating fac-
tors. The editors of these journals some-
times serve as secretary or managing
director of the society in addition to be-
ing editor and in such capacity are afford-
ed an excellent opportunity to develop
their administrative, organizational, and
managerial abilities.
Staff editors of company subsidized
engineering magazines—an outstanding
example of which is the Westinghouse
Engineer—work under a broad spectrum
of editing freedom. At one end is the al-
most zero lack of freedom to develop
and edit material. At the other end is
complete freedom in the choice of ma-
terial and in the editing of this material.
Within these limits, an editor on one of

Since the organization of the Depart-
ment of Engineering Research in 1920,
many changes have taken place in the
world of science and technology which
have profoundly affected our way of life.
The third of a century elapsed since 1920
has witnessed more significant growth of
fundamental knowledge and more techno-
logical advances than any other similar
span of time in the history of mankind.
We at the University of Michigan can
take pride in the fact that the Engineering
Research Institute has had a part in many
of the more important phases of this
progress.
It is stimulating to contemplate the
possibility that the scientists and engi-
neers of tomorrow will secure even
greater benefits to mankind than did their
predecessors. Provided that we will be
able to avoid a disastrous total war and
that our economic system will remain
stable, we can look forward to higher
standards of living, improved health, and
longer hours of leisure, which, however,
will be a blessing only if we know how to
enjoy the newly won freedom with profit
to ourselves and society.
Services of the Institute
Since the Institute, being an integral
part of the University, is a nonprofit or-
ganization, the Director and the several
administrative and advisory committees
have at all times been guided by the prin-
ciple of service: service to science and
engineering, service to industry, service
to the community, and service to the Uni-
versity.
Serine to Science and Engineering.—
A service to science and engineering is
performed whenever research is under-
taken for the sake of making observa-
tions and obtaining facts which, when
systematized and related to known facts
and existing theories, enrich the total
store of our knowledge. This sort of re-
search, called fundamental or basic re-
search, is usually carried on without any
thought of applicability to specific prob-
lems. Frequently, however, the results
of such research form an immediate basis
for practical applications. Moreover, the
scientist himself not uncommonly envi-
sions the developmental possibilities of
his findings.

High temperature creep rupture testing.
On the other hand, scientific inquiry of
a fundamental nature is at times an out-
growth of applied research, and not in-
frequently a research project involves
both types of scientific endeavor.
Service to Industry.—The Institute's
principal service to industry is the appli-
cation of fundamental research, either
old or new, to specific industrial or engi-
needing problems. Many of the research
activities of the Institutes have led to
improved methods of manufacturing, the
design of new devices, and the fabrica-
tion of improved and new work materials.
Whether this type of research begins with
the desire to put to use certain results of
fundamental research or whether it starts
from a definite need, the end results are
the same: a new product, a better product,
or an old product at less cost.
A second type of service to industry
consists of the analysis of production
difficulties and plant operating troubles.
Much of the sponsored research aimed
at the elimination of such exigencies has
come to the Institute either as a result of
consultation on the part of one or sev-
eral of the University's faculty men or
through contacts of the Institute's own
representatives.
Experimental laboratory testing, though
often very important to the manufacturer,
was, as a general rule, undertaken only
when existing commercial laboratories
could not perform the task because they
lacked either sufficiently trained person-
nel or the necessary equipment.
Service to the Community.—Service to
the community comprises all the research
that is carried on to improve the health,
happiness, and well-being of the indi-
vidual and the family of a community,
whether town, county, or state. This kind
of investigation cuts across all types of
research; it is distinct solely because it
benefits only a special group of people.
Work done to improve our highways
and construct bridges, research connected
with the preservation of natural resources,
studies concerned with our shore lines
and harbors, and lastly, research for pub-
lic utility companies to assure the best
service at lowest cost—all have con-
tributed to our welfare and happiness.
Service to the University.—However,
the work of the Institute benefits not only
12
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


all of us as individuals, but also the Uni-
versity in its two primary functions:
teaching and research. If the research is
of a fundamental nature, the scientist or
engineer conducting the investigation ac-
cumulates new bits of knowledge and dis-
covers new truths; if it is of an applied
character, he profits by becoming ac-
quainted with the problems confronting
industry and also by learning to apply
fundamental principles to their solutions.
Research enriches his experience and
consequently makes him a more effective
teacher in the classroom and laboratory,
as well as a better research worker. In
fact, sponsored research has in many in-
stances been an incentive to a faculty
man to pursue a problem further by re-
search of his own. Cognizant of these
facts, contract proposals have always been
examined from the standpoint of what
the proposed research project would do in
the matter of stimulating and assisting
educational activities within the Univer-
sity.
Better teachers prepare better students,
and better students in turn make better
engineers and better research workers in
the laboratories of tomorrow. This is
highly important in the engineering and
physical sciences, where there is still a
distinct shortage of University-trained
specialists, a shortage which in all prob-
ability will continue to be felt at least
throughout the present decade, even if
the international situation should im-
prove.
Finally, certain funds have been set
aside for the benefit of those instruc-
tional departments of the University
whose staffs participate in Institute re-
search activities. During the year 1952-53
grants amounting to $112,486 were made
to these departments for support of re-
search work.
Other funds of the Institute have gone
into the construction of the Cooley Mem-
orial Building, which will house some In-
stitute research projects. By June 30,
1953, a total of $1,145,000 had been
allocated for this purpose. Of this
amount, the sum of $270,000 was ap-
propriated during the report year.
Resources of the Institute
Personnel.—The Engineering Research
Institute draws on a highly trained and
qualified faculty to supervise and under-
take research. The diversity of the fac-
ulty's fields of interest is exceedingly im-
portant in these days, when there no
longer exist the boundaries which form-
erly were believed to confine the various
sciences, when, in fact, their interaction
rather than their self-sufficiency has be-
come a dominant concept, and, conse-
quently, research methods once thought
to be applicable to only one field are
used with equal success in another.
Since about 1930, when it became evi-
dent that sponsored studies in some very
specialized fields require full-time super-
visors and research workers, the Institute
has been engaging the services of many
specialists. (The Willow Run Research
Center has been staffed almost exclusively
by full-time nonfaculty personnel.)
A third group of Institute personnel is
made up of graduate and undergraduate
students, whose part-time employment
enables them to continue their studies and
gives them, in addition, valuable research
experience.
Lastly, there are many technicians, some
with special skills.
With this varied personnel, the serv-
ices of many highly trained specialists
may be engaged on any one project,
and the number of workers may be ad-
justed to conditions as they develop.
Laboratory and Library Facilities.—An
important factor in conducting modern
research are the manifold facilities of
numerous up-to-date laboratories available
for research, where scientific and engi-
neering investigations may be carried on
unhampered by production demands.
While much of the equipment of these
laboratories is standard research equip-
ment, some of it has been designed and
built by the University's own staffs for
specific application.
Making use of the University's exten-
sive and well-rounded collection of books
and journals in the several college and
departmental libraries, the University re-
search worker has readily available the
means for keeping abreast of recent de-
velopments in his field and surveying the
literature pertinent to the specific prob-
lem he is investigating.
Publications
Some of the research carried on
through the Institute produces results that
are worthy of dissemination as contribu-
tions to the sum total of scientific and
engineering knowledge. Some of these
results have been published, with the
sponsor's consent, through the Institute's
own publication media. To date, slightly

By J. G. Tarboux, Ph.D., Professor of Elecfrical Engineering
What distinguishes the Power Engineer
from the Communication or Radio Engi-
neer? This question is being asked by
many young men who are seeking a col-
lege education in Electrical Engineering.
Some of the answers that are being given
to this question are wise answers but
many poor and misleading statements
are also afloat.
It is well first to devote a little time to
review the history of Electrical Engineer-
ing and also to point out some of the re-
lationships which Electrical Engineering
may possess with associated branches of
engineering, science and other profes-
sional areas.
Electricity, as an important adjunct to
society is quite young. True, some of the
basic laws of induction and magnetic
phenomena are quite old in terms of the
age span of one human generation, but
electricity as a tool of society goes back
about three generations, that is our
grandfathers and certainly our great
grandfathers had neither electric lights
or the telephone. The radio comes close
to falling within the period of life of the
present generation.
Early development of Electrical Engi-
neering dealt with the electric lamp and
applications to the problems of turning
the wheels of industry. This feature is re-
flected in the history of the college cur-
ricula of the early days and reflections
of which are still present in our colleges.
Departments of Electrical Engineering
sprung out of either expansions of
Mechanical Engineering or possibly as off-
shoots of Physics.
Research and development in these
early days emphasized electricity as the
worker of industry. Early research may
have lacked the classical theoretical touch,
being more along the trial and error
method, but it was quite successful as at-
tested by the tremendous growth of in-
dustry.
Following the growth of the power in-
dustry we saw the horizons expanding
by the use of electricity in the fields of
communication of information, and with
the advent of the vacuum tube we have
seen literally a wonderland of scientific
horizons opening up, so large that our
young people have been so attracted to its
marvels that the older brothers in power
have been labelled as old fashion and not
up to date.
Professor J. G. Tarboux
This situation is serious enough to
prompt many persons to speak and write
on the subject. The Power Industry is
concerned by the fact that Electrical Engi-
neering students are not interested in fol-
lowing the power field, rather they are at-
tracted by the wonders of electronics. So,
let us attempt to define the area of work
and functions of the Power Engineer as
distinct from the Electronics or Com-
munication Engineer. First it should be
emphasized that much of the distinction
which has been suggested to exist between
these two types of engineers is in fact
non-existant and has very little basis of
existance.
Here are some of the current concep-
tions of difference between these two pro-
fessional brothers.
In some minds the dividing line be-
tween the Power and the Communication
Fields is as reflected in the titles of our
academic options; namely the study of
machinery is in the Power field, while the
study of vacuum tubes fall in the Elec-
tronics or Communication field.
Others prefer to define the areas in
terms of academic or scientific techniques.
For example, electromagnetic wave theory
is considered by many as only in the
field of Communication, even though the
induction motor as well as the transmis-
sion of electrical energy, both follow the
laws of Poynting's Vector.
Simple, classical treatments of tran-
sients have been considered as acceptable
to the Power Option, but modern opera-
tional analyses as foreign to the list of
tools of the Power man. Tensor Analyses
falls in this general category of the more
modern, higher level mathematical tech-
niques, which has found its way into the
analyses of electrical machinery.
Field mapping and analyses is another
useful technique in the machinery area.
Very interesting and illuminating results
are found by the application of such
techniques in the study of iron losses and
heating in various types of machinery.
Others would make the dividing line
in terms of the amount of power handled,
say the Power engineer handles every-
thing above 1000 watts or any other
magical number. This is a very poor con-
cept.
In truth, we must come to the realiza-
tion that a distinction between these two
professional titles is quite artificial. Cer-
tainly the field of Power Engineering is
not limited to the electrical utility busi-
ness, it is much broader. How about the
manufacturing industry, and the basic
metals industry? These are certainly in
the Power family.
For lack of a better definition it is
suggested that we think of the Power
Engineer as primarily interested in the
research, development, operation, main-
tenance and all other associated areas hav-
ing to do with the process of turning the
wheels of industry, where the financial
compensation is primarily measured in
terms of the value of energy as the basic-
element, in contrast to the Communication
Engineer who has as the major objective
the transmission of intelligence in all of
its forms and whose compensation is pri-
marily measured in the value of service
rendered rather than the value of the
energy involved.
To keep the record clear, we might
agree in part to the charge often made by
our brothers in Communication Engineer-
ing, that Power people have been slow in
accepting the more modern techniques
brought about by the electronics and com-
munication fraternity. A good bit of this
charge is correct. However, the charge is
often biased and falls into the same group
of the common complaints of the modern
generation against its ancestors.
Specifically, what are the areas of work
for the Power Engineer? Functionally, he
may find his place in either technology or
management. In the technology category
14
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Application, Design, Manufacturing, De-
velopment, and Research.
Irrespective of the particular phase of
engineering, whether general industry or
even the power utility field, the young
engineering graduate will probably travel
through these functional steps in the gen-
eral order mentioned.
On the management side are areas of:
Sales, Promotion, Personnel, Public Rela-
tions, Evaluation, Budget Work and Ad-
ministration.
It is interesting to note that a recent
survey of American industry showed that
40% of the top policy level management
personnel comes from engineering gradu-
ates. Another study shows that in 150
larger corporations, 50% had an engineer
as the chief executive officer.
Definitely the Power Engineer deals
with large units, measured physically and
also in terms of electrical or mechanical
capacity. Small units are, however, also in
his list of responsibilities. Notice that
the power demand of the country has
been doubling every ten years. In terms of
the average utility of this region this
means the addition of about 250,000 kw
of generating capacity per year to keep
in the race.
Since the power field starts with the
generation of electrical energy, let us take
a look at some of the problems of the
power plant.
The January 1954 report of generating
facilities showed a total installed capacity
of 88,617,609 kw: 66,968,492 kw in fuel
plants and 21,649,117 kw in hydro
plants as of November 1, 1953, the
ownership being divided between private
companies, federal government and local
governments in the ratios: 77.7%,
12.4%, and 9.9%.
Steam turbine units of 250,000 kw,
3600 rpm are now standard. A decade
ago designers hesitated to tackle designs
of one quarter of this size. Inlet tem-
peratures of 1000 degrees F and pres-
sures of 2000 pounds per square inch
are now common practice. These large
sizes have come about by extensive re-
search in magnetic materials, mechanical
structure of metals, heat transfer and bet-
ter methods of cooling, and extensive de-
velopment of better insulating materials.
Of unusual interest is the use of com-
pletely enclosed units cooled by hydro-
gen gas. More recently the cooling ducts
bring the hydrogen gas in direct contact
with the generator windings. In other
designs of large generators the generator
coils are constructed of hollow conductors
through which is circulated a coolant. By
this design it is estimated that 15 times
as much heat may be removed giving ap-
proximately a current capacity four times
greater than obtained in standard designs.
An appreciation if not an understand-
ing of physical chemistry, metallurgy, heat
transfer and other allied fields of science
are necessary requirements for the de-
signer of such equipment.
Other important areas in generation
include such developments as the radial
gas engine, the gas turbine, studies in
solar collectors, wind power units, tidal
energy and, of course, the developments
in the atomic energy field.
The problems associated with exciter
systems is noteworthy. In recent years the
exciter system has been considered as a
closed system and studied by the methods
common to servomechanisms. This is an
unusually challenging problem, since the
various links in the system are not linear
in their response.
In the transformer field, single phase
units of 60,000 kva capacity were con-
sidered about the limit 15 years ago. To-
day, three phase designs of 220,000 kva,
are possible.
Fifteen years ago the Hoover Dam-
Los Angeles Transmission Lines at 287
kv were considered as the upper limit of
possible transmission voltages. Several
utilities have decided on voltages of 300
to 350 kv for future construction. Mod-
ern designs are considering group con-
ductors instead of single wires. Counter-
poising also offers a challenge to the de-
signer.
Circuit breakers are in a sense one of
the critical elements of the modern power
system. A few years ago 2,500,000 kva
of interrupting capacity was considered
unusual. Today, 10,000,000 kva interrupt-
ing capacity is common.
The composite power system with in-
terconnections from Chicago to the South-
ern part of the country, from Chicago
to the East as far as New York City and
Philadelphia bring about many chal-
lenging problems, involving technology,
economics, management and also public
relations between operating companies,
the general public and also with federal
and local government. Some of the prob-
lems include power and reactive inter-
change, economic use of fuel and hydro
plants of different designs, and the proper
place for interchange of energy between
separate operating groups, the analyses
and control of the power limit or sys-
tem stability of lines and equipment,
operation of the system under normal
transients caused by switching and ab-
normal faulted conditions, and operation
and protection under lightning condi-
tions.
The network problems imposed by such
interconnected systems are certainly chal-
lenging, and the study of the normal and
abnormal operation of such systems offer
opportunity for analyses to the mathe-
matically capable individual. A common
problem is the study of the lightning
surges created by a direct stroke, with its
successive reflections at points of discon-
tinuities, with some energy passing to
ground, some being reflected with the as-
sociated dangers of over voltage due to
reflections.
Servomechanism techniques developed
as a child of the last war are finding fer-
tile fields in industrial control. Many
systems for speed control, shape followers
and quality control are normal and found
in the basic metals manufacture and paper
production. The amplidyne and its com-
petitors are widely used in many areas.
The welding industry offers challenges
to the operator in the development of
new methods of application, and to the
designer in the improvement of welding
units.
The field of materials handling in-
volving cranes, cable ways, and other con-
struction projects has its own peculiar
demands to the control engineer.
In the fields of electronics, consider
the problems of rectification of 250,000
kw in one locality, as used in the pro-
duction of aluminum. In one such in-
stallation sixty-phase units, rectifying of
the order of 65000 kw are in use. The
harmonic problems and the correspond-
ing telephone interference offer very nice
meat for technological as well as econom-
ical study.
Another interesting electronic applica-
tion is found in one of the large steel
mills of the country, where 20,000 kw is
interchanged between a 44 kv, 25 cycle
system and a 69 kv, sixty-cycle system by
the use of 48 high voltage ignitrons, the
central link being a short DC section.
The development in the design and
manufacture of electric motors merits
mention. A present day 30 HP motor is
built in the same over all dimensions as a
20 HP motor of 25 years ago or a 5 HP
motor of 50 years ago. This change has
been brought about by better electrical
design and also an improved knowledge
of magnetic theory and the improved
use of metals. Further improvements will
come about when more advanced theories

RCA News Release
A new method which, for the first time
in history, makes it possible to convert
atomic energy directly and simply into
small but usable quantities of electrical
energy sufficient to operate a transistor,
was announced recently by Brig. General
David Sarnoff, Chairman of the Board
of the Radio Corporation of America.
General Sarnoff said:
"For more than forty years, science has
searched for a practical way of converting
radiations from the atom's nucleus to
electricity. Though our research is far
from completed, successful operation of
RCA's Atomic Battery in our laboratories
represents a major breakthrough toward
that goal.
"The conversion of nuclear energy
into electricity is achieved by an experi-
mental RCA Atomic Battery, powered by
a minute quantity of a long-life stron-
tium-90 radioactive isotope obtained as
a by-product of atomic reactor operation.
The electric current derived from this
unique atomic battery exceeds by many
times all previous results attained in at-
tempts to generate usable electricity di-
rectly from radioactive material.
"This big strike has been achieved by
coupling the battery's radioactive source
to a transistor-like wafer, which in-
stantaneously releases some 200,000 elec-
trons for each electron it receives from
the radioactive material.
"This development, though still in a
pioneer stage, may prove to be the be-
ginning of a new and basic chapter in
man's efforts to utilize some of the
enormous untapped energies within the
nucleus of the atom for peaceful purposes
and for the enrichment of human life
rather than its destruction.
"Although it is still too soon to know
all the uses to which this direct conver-
sion of nuclear energy might be put, the
prospect of an entirely different kind of
power source is a particularly exciting one
for the electronics industry.
"Perhaps as startling an advance as
any in connection with the RCA Atomic-
Battery is the fact that a single rapidly
moving electron, emitted from the radio-
active atom, produces no less than
200,000 slower electrons in the bombard-
ed semi-conductor. It is this extraordinary
multiplication in the number of available-
electrons which promises to make the
atomic battery a usable device of practical
significance.
"Progress in increasing the efficiency
of the battery has been rapid during the
past few months and is expected to con-
tinue. Results to date indicate the possi-
bilities of producing thimble-size, atomic
batteries. When these experimental bat-
teries are developed to a commercial
stage, they can supply power for radio
receivers and other kinds of electronic
apparatus, without replenishment or at-
tention for at least twenty years.
"The atomic battery is likely to be ap-
plied first to miniature devices such as
portable and pocket-size radio receivers,
hearing-aids, signal Control, and similar
devices that require reliable power sources
with great length of service.
"As we learn how to produce atomic
batteries with more power than is ob-
tained from present experimental models,
it may be possible to use them for operat-
ing portable short-range transmitters for
radio telegraph and telephone communi-
cation and radio beacons for navigation
by air or by sea.
"Of great importance is the fact that
such atomic batteries will be highly com-
patible with future equipment using
transistors. Both the battery and the tran-
sistor have the potential advantages of
compactness, ruggedness and long life.
"The RCA Atomic Battery is now
generating sufficient electricity from a
minute quantity of strontium-90 to ener-
gize a transistor and to produce an
audible tone in a telephone receiver. We
expect materials other than strontium-90,
now under study, to yield as good or
better results. Surveys indicate that such
radioactive waste materials will be in
plentiful supply.
"This new and distinctive approach to
the harnessing of the atom's energy for
peaceful purposes is most timely. I have
in mind the atomic peace proposals
President Eisenhower laid before the
United Nations on last December 8th.
These proposals for international develop-
ment of the peaceful uses of the atom
are now being discussed between nations
and are much in the public mind.
"This achievement of the atomic bat-
tery is further evidence of the opportuni-

to develop the industrial uses of atomic
energy. It is a step toward greater partici-
pation by free competitive enterprise in a
field that challenges the imagination and
calls for initiative and pioneering.
"No one can look far enough ahead to
see all the ways in which a new prin-
ciple or scientific method will find prac-
tical application. Some of these, however,
we can anticipate, such as providing small
quantities of power at low voltage for
various kinds of electronic devices where
extreme compactness, ruggedness and
long life without attention are important
factors. But when we deal with something
as basic as capturing the energy of the
atom and turning it directly into elec-
tricity, the first practical applications may
not foretell the full scope and range of
its future usefulness.
"The history of science and invention
presents many notable examples of scien-
tific progress of which the atomic battery
is the latest. When Michael Faraday first
produced an electric current it was with a
relatively simple device: a copper disk
rotated between the ends of a magnet.
Faraday—120 years ago—did not visual-
ize the future of his invention, yet, today,
the huge power generators at Niagara
and the Hoover Dam operate on the same
basic principle of Faraday's discovery.
"The discoveries and inventions which
RCA is announcing provide a significant
opportunity for further developments in
the field of atomic energy.
Assessing technical aspects of the new
method, Dr. E. W. Engstrom, Executive
Vice President in Charge, R.C.A. Labora-
tories Division, declared that the RCA
Atomic Battery has produced usable elec-
trical power a hundred times more effi-
cienty than any previously reported radio-
active generator. For a specific quantity
of radioactive material, he said, the elec-
tric current generated by this new method
is about 200,000 times greater than has
ever before been attained from experi-
mental methods.
Dr. Engstrom pointed out that the
Atomic Battery is a result of combining
studies of the basic problems of radio-
active generation of electricity conducted
by RCA over the past few years with
recent developments in transistors and
other semi-conductors in the field of
solid-state electronics.
In experiments with Atomic Batteries,
Dr. Engstrom explained, both silicon and
germanium crystals have been tried as
"transformers" of the beta radiation to
useful electricity.

of radio-active material in its face which is placed next to transistor-like wafer.
Radiated electrons bombard wafer and release many more electrons which pro-
vide battery's current and voltage.
Earlier Investigations
"In previous studies of radioactive gen-
erators," said Dr. Engstrom, "RCA scien-
tists headed by Dr. D. Irving Wolff and
Dr. Ernest C. Linder have investigated
other approaches, gaining understanding
of the problems that has been valuable in
achieving the present Atomic Battery. One
of the first generators was a large vacuum
tube the size of a football in which a
small bit of radioactive material built up
huge voltages but could provide only a
minute current. Scaling down of the vol-
tage to practicable levels resulted in some
loss of efficiency.
"In an investigation subsequent to the
development of the vacuum-type radio-
active generator, a radioactive voltage
source was built which does not require
a vacuum. The voltage source was in the
form of a condenser, one plate of which
was coated with a beta emitter and the
other serving as a collector plate. The
plates were separated by a dielectric ma-
terial such as polystyrene or mica. The
device produced voltages at usable levels
but still each bombarding electron could
'make' no more than one electron for the
output. Therefore, the efficiency of nu-
clear to electrical energy conversion was
considerably lower than that attained in
RCA's new Atomic Battery."
Dr. Engstrom called attention to the
fact that RCA's new approach to atomic
batteries is reported by Paul Rappaport,
physicist on the technical staff of the
David Sarnoff Center of RCA, Princeton,
New Jersey, in a current issue of the
Physical Review. Mr. Rappaport's report
is entitled, "The Electron Voltaic Effect
in P-N Junctions Induced by Beta Particle
Bombardment."
Following World War II, RCA under-
took a research program with the objec-
tive of direct conversion of nuclear energy
to electricity. This objective was to make
use of atomic energy for constructive pur-
poses—such as power sources—whether
for military or peacetime applications.
This research program continued, and in
1951 further encouragement resulted
from the interest shown and support
given by the U.S. Air Force. As we
progressed with this research, RCA pro-
posed and concentrated its attention on

INDUSTRY
By RICHARD STEVENSON, Grad
and NORMAN WILLIAMSON, Grad.
For a number of years now work has
been proceeding in order to bring perfec-
tion to the crudely conceived idea of a
machine that would not only supply in-
verse reactive current for use in unilateral
phase detractors, but would also be capa-
ble of automatically synchronizing cardi-
nal grammeters. Such a machine is the
"Turbo-Encabulator." Basically, the only
new principle involved is that instead of
power being generated by the relative mo-
tion of conductors and fluxes, it is pro-
duced by the modial interaction of mag-
neto-reluctance and capacitive directance.
The original machine had a base-plate
of prefabulated amulite, surmounted by a
malleable logarithmic casing in such a
way that the two spurving bearings were
in a direct line with the pentametric fan.
The latter consisted simply of six hydro-
coptic marzelvanes, so fitted to the ambi-
facient lunar waneshaft that side fum-
bling was effectively prevented. The main
winding was of the normal lotus-o-delta
type placed in panendermic semiboloid
slots in the stator, every seventh conduc-
tor being connected by a non-reversible
tremie pipe to the differential girdle-
spring on the "up" end of the gram-
meters.
Forty-one manestically spaced grout-
ing brushes were arranged to feed into
the rotor slip-stream a mixture of high
S-value phenylhydrobenzamine and five
per cent reminative tetryliodohcxamine.
Both of these liquids have specific peri-
cosities given by P = 2.5n": where n is
the diathetical evolute of retrograde tem-
perature phase disposition and C is
Cholmondelay's annular grillage coeffi-
cient. Initially, n was measured with the
aid of ametopolar refractive pilfrometer
(for a description of this ingenious in-
strument, see L. E. Rumpelverstein in
"Zeitschrift fur Elektrotechnistatischs-
Donnerblitze" vol. vii), but up to the
present date nothing has been found to
equal the transcendental hopper dado-
scope. (See "Proceedings of the Peruvian
Academy of Sciences" June 1914.)
Electrical engineers will appreciate the
difficulty of nubing together a regurgita-
tive purwell and a supramitive wennel-
sprocket. Indeed, this proved to be a
stumbling block to further development
until, in 1942, it was found that the use
of anhydrous nangling pins enabled a
kryptonastic boiling shim to be tankered.
The early attempts to construct a suffi-
ciently robust spiral decommutator failed
largely because of a lack of appreciation
of the large quasi-piestic stresses in the
gremlin studs; the latter were specially
designed to hold the rofTit bars to the

spamshaft. When, however, it was dis-
covered that wending could be prevented
by a simple addition to the living sockets,
almost perfect running was secured.
The operating point is maintained as
near as possible to the h.f. rem peak by
constantly fromaging the bitumogenous
spandrels. This is a distinct advance on
the standard nivelsheave in that no dram-
cock oil is required after the phase de-
tractors have remissed.
Undoubtedly, the turbo-encabulator has
now reached a very high level of techni-
cal development. It has been successfully
used for operating nofer trunnions. In
addition, whenever a barescent skor mo-
tion is required, it may be employed in
conjunction with a drawn reciprocating
dingle arm to reduce sinusoidal deplene-
ration.

A
Second
Education
What makes a job hold its interest?
After working for three years,
Wylic Borum, E. E., '50, tells us
what has kept his interest alive.
(Reading time: 38 seconds)
rde graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in
1950, but Wylie Borum's education still hasn't ended.
His job, he explains, has become his second education.
And this continuing process of learning has kept his
job interesting.
Wylic's first year at Bell Telephone Company of
Pennsylvania was spent as a student engineer, which
he feels was not only educational but extremely worth
while. For it was while he took this course that he
glimpsed the complexity of the business in considerable
detail. He worked in all departments — ran switch-
boards, climbed poles and even did a stint in the
Accounting Department.
Wylie discovered that there were many spots in the
telephone organization for engineers besides the General
Engineering Department. Even in Accounting — which
today is highly mechanized with things like Centralized
Automatic Message Accounting Machines.
Training finished, Wylie was assigned to the Manual
Equipment Section of the General Engineering Depart-
ment. His education continued. He found out, he
reports, that the dollar is an important part of engineer-
ing. In writing equipment specifications, he had to be
sure of reasonable cost as well as efficient operation.
There's a big difference, he discovered, in doing a
theoretical job in school and doing a job in which
costs are an important consideration.
Now Wylie has been promoted to the Plant Ex-
tension Engineering Group and still is learning. I lis
present job is co-ordinating plans for replacing the
last manual central office in Philadelphia with a dial
system. The cost will be approximately $1,500,000.
It's a big responsibility. But the Telephone Com-
pany puts capable young men on their own quickly.

Wylie Borum's job is with an operating company of

Catalyst Cap Keeps Batteries Pull With
the Help of Tiny Monel Screens
"Sorry, Mac. You need a new battery"
. . . and often the garage man says it be-
cause a motorist neglected to have his
battery checked regularly. But now his
battery can be serviced almost automatical-
ly. At least, it can go seven times longer
before additional water is needed, ac-
cording to Industrial Research, Inc.,
Miami, Florida.
Their Hydrocaps screw into an auto
battery in place of the usual cell caps
(see photo). They catch oxygen and hy-
drogen released when a battery is over-
charged in driving; then reunite the gases
by means of a palladium-coated catalyst
and return the resulting water to the bat-
tery cells.
As the droplets trickle back into the
battery they also absorb sulfuric acid
fumes escaping from the cells. This elim-
inates the cause of corroded cables, ter-
minals, and holders which often plague
the auto owner, too.
Industrial Research needed a tiny per-
forated screen to protect the catalyst in the
cap. First they tried a nickel-plated non-
ferrous screen. It resisted the sulfuric
acid fumes satisfactorily but slowed pro-
duction of the caps. So they switched to
Monel screens. Monel, which resists even
the corrosion of sulfuric acid pickling so-
lutions, proved just right. It could also be
easily perforated and formed to make the
little screens only .005-inch thick.
For railroads and other industrial bat-
tery users, Industrial Research has also
developed an all-metal Hydrocap. It is
made of Monel, too, to resist the attack
of corrosive fumes as well as shock and
rough usage.
Roll Out of McDonnell XV-1
Convertiplane Announced
Roll out of the XV-1 Convertiplane—
first military aircraft of this type ever
developed in the United States—was an-
nounced recently by the Air Research and
Development Command of the U. S. Air
Force, and the McDonnell Aircraft Cor-
poration. The XV-1 is the first converti-
plane in the world to utilize the principle
of pressure jets and high disc loading.
The Convertiplane is a joint develop-
ment of Wright Air Development Center
of the U. S. Air Force, Transportation
Corps of the U. S. Army and McDonnell
Aircraft Corporation. The Convertiplane's
versatility will permit studies on its tacti-
cal use for observation and reconnais-
sance. Further studies will be made of its
design uses as an artillery and tank spot-
ter. An attendant function will be the ex-
ploration of the application of the con-
vertiplane principle to larger aircraft.
The convertiplane embodies a com-
pletely new conception of flight. This
new concept is known as the "unloaded
rotor" principle—a machine equipped

with a rotor for vertical flight and wings
and propeller for forward flight.
In vertical flight or hovering, the rotor
provides all the lift; in forward flight
the wings provide essentially all the lift.
This allows the rotor to autorotate at its
lowest drag configuration. This avoids the
speed limitation encountered by conven-
tional helicopters due to stalling of blades
when they must carry lift at high speeds.
Each of the three blades of the rotor is
powered by a McDonnell-developed pres-
sure jet unit located at the tip of the
blade. A Continental reciprocating engine
is provided on the aft fuselage to supply
air to the pressure jet units during vertical
flight and power to the propeller during
forward flight.
The efficient and relatively great power
available from the pressure jets allows
the use of a rotor having approximately
half the drag of a conventional helicopter
rotor. Since the wings do not provide the
lift during take-off or landing, they are
approximately half the size of the wings
for conventional fixed wing aircraft.
Therefore, speed performance of the
convertiplane is not greatly penalized by
utilizing both rotor and wing.
The XV-1 is designed to carry three
passengers, or two litter patients and
medical attendant in addition to the pilot.
The craft is approximately 30 feet long,
ten feet high and spans 26 feet in width.
Prior to the first actual flight, which
will not take place until next summer, an
extensive research program will be re-
quired. This will include ground testing,
careful instrumentation for the develop-
ment of flight test data, and painstaking
pre-flight test work. The full-scale model
will be placed in a wind tunnel to test
aerodynamic characteristics.
The Convertiplane's tail assembly con-
sists of two vertical fins and rudders at-
tached to the extremities of twin tail
booms. The horizontal surface consists of
a single stabilizer with tabs, mounted be-
tween the ends of the tail booms.
The crew compartment in the fuselage
is equipped with large plastic windows
which provide exceptionally wide range
of vision. It is separated from the engine
section by a structural firewall. Pilot and
co-pilot-observer sit in tandem, with re-

What do YOU look for in an employer?
Undoubtedly, you'll want most of the following characteristics:
1. Job satisfaction—the chance to do work you really enjoy.
2. Recognition—the assurance that good work will be noticed, appreciated,
and properly rewarded.
3. Opportunities for advancement—a growing company can provide them.
4. Security—the knowledge that a company is both stable and progressive.
5. Pride—a feeling that your company is respected by the public and produces
goods which contribute to a better way of life.
6. Good companionship—a factor which contributes greatly to happiness on
the job.
7. Good pay—not in salary alone, but also in terms of vacation plans, pensions,
and other benefits.
8. Safe working conditions.
How can you obtain this kind of information in advance?
One of the best ways is to discuss the matter with an acquaintance already
working for the company you are considering. You will also find it helpful to
consult your college placement officer, your professors and company repre-
sentatives visiting your campus.
The selection of an employer is one of the most important decisions yo*&gt; M
make. It justifies considerable thought and effort.

Two non-retracting skids comprise the

Fuel is fed to the three pressure-jet tip

driven from the rotor hub accessory drive.
The pressure jets operate on the prin-
ciple of ignition and expansion of the

application of power directly to the blade
tips eliminates the torque which in con-

eliminated by the use of a second rotor
or propeller.
"Electricity for Better Living"
The latest and perhaps most exciting
chapter in the wonderful story of "Elec-

man's eternal struggle against the tyranny
of the weather in his own home. It con-
cerns the development of an amazing
all-electric machine called a heat pump
that burns no fuel, uses no water, yet
automatically heats and cools your home
to the desired temperature.
The machine requires no attention.
Once the thermostat is set to the desired
temperature, your home is completely air
conditioned throughout the year at the
temperature you want. You just set it and
forget it. Switchover from cooling to
heating is completely automatic—from
season to season, within the same day,
and even hourly if the need arises.
The Weathertron provides "push-button
weather" for the home without even push-
ing a button!
Surprisingly, the broad outline for this
new chapter in "Electricity For Better
Living" was written one hundred and one
years ago by the famous English physicist
Lord Kelvin when he presented his theory
on the heating and cooling of buildings
with currents of air to the Glasgow Philo-
sophical Society in Scotland.
Lord Kelvin's theory suggested the
possibility of heating homes with refrig-
eration systems, and also cooling them by
reversing the system's cycle of operation.
Interest in the idea remained very low
until 21 years ago when advances in re-
frigerants and refrigeration indicated its

practicality and work was undertaken by
several companies to fill in the details of
Lord Kelvin's outline with a practical
machine.
But the chapter was not written quick-
ly. There was much to be done in the
way of development and field testing of
equipment and ideas.
In 1932, General Electric made what is
believed to be the first practical installa-
tion of a Heat Pump in this country in
an office in Salem, N.J. Since that time,
hundreds of G-E Weathertrons have been
placed in homes in widely scattered parts
of the United States. Performance under
many kinds and climates and conditions
have been studied, and in November,
1951, after 20 years of engineering de-
velopment and field testing, the Company
began marketing the first packaged air-
to-air Heat Pump sold in this country.
The G-E Weathertron, as the G-E heat
pump is called is what is known as an
air-to-air unit. That is, nothing but air
and electricity are used to provide the

heating and cooling. As its rather prosaic
but technically descriptive name implies,
the Heat Pump, by the use of an ingeni-
ous arrangement of refrigerant and air
flow, simply pumps heat from one place
to another and in so doing either cools
or heats the space it serves depending on
whether the heat is pumped into or out of
the house. Electricity provides the power
for the pumping operation.
The unit brings much nearer to reali-
zation the long-dreamed of truly all-elec-
tric home. There can be no question that
it is currently the most exciting advance
toward fuller enjoyment of the great
potentialities of electrical living. Unlike
high temperature resistance type heating
and the newer low temperature radiant
panel electric heating which contribute
nothing to comfort when cooling is re-
quired, the Weathertron inherently pro-
vides for summer cooling as well as heat-
ing and operates at an efficiency—three
times as great as resistance heating—

MOST OF THE RESEARCH WORK that led to the development of
Ultraforming—a more efficient and economical refining process—took
place in the Whiting research laboratories of Standard Oil, above.
Extensive studies in seventeen research-scale units demonstrated
the merits of cyclic regeneration.
Standard Oil scientists develop Ultraforming—
the latest in catalytic reforming
After several years of research, Standard Oil
scientists have developed a new and important
refining process—Ultraforming.
The process is a better way of improving the
low-octane straight-run gasoline found in crude
oil. To make such gasoline suitable for present
day cars, refiners must change it into an en-
tirely different material, which gives good anti-
knock performance. The change is known as
reforming.
Ultraforming is the last word in catalytic
reforming. It gives greater yields of higher
octane gasoline than were previously possible
and gets good results even with poor feed
stocks. In addition, it raises the yield of
hydrogen, an increasingly valuable by-product
of catalytic reforming.
Ultraforming units do not have to be shut
down when the catalyst begins to lose activity
through use. By a new technique, an im-
proved platinum catalyst is regenerated to
maintain peak performance.
The advantages of Ultraforming over pre-
vious methods are so great that Standard Oil
and its subsidiary companies are building units
at four refineries. They will start operating
this year. The new process, of course, is avail-
able to the petroleum industry through licens-
ing arrangements.
At Standard Oil, young engineers and chem-
ists work with the stimulating knowledge that
they are participating in important and last-
ing contributions to the oil industry and to
their country.

state. It was here that effective means
were found for direct conversion of nu-
clear energy to electricity. And this led
to the Atomic Battery.
Potentialities of Atomic Battery
"Until recently," Dr. Engstrom con-
tinued, "radioactive battery devices pro-
duced, at best, a billionth of a watt of
power under conditions suitable for tran-
sistor operation. With only a small
amount of radioactive material, a single
RCA Atomic Battery provides a millionth
of a watt—enough to run a transistor
audio oscillator circuit. This gives a tone
that is audible twenty feet away. With
more radioactive material, a number of
these 'one-cell' devices could be stacked
in a single case to produce a larger out-
put.
"Much basic research on materials and
methods is yet to be done. For the long
run, however, the prospects are encour-
aging—not only for building long-life-
atomic batteries into portable or unat-
tended equipment, but also for providing
considerable quantities of electrical power
from large accumulations of otherwise
wasted radioactive material.
"As the industrial and commercial de-
velopment of atomic energy expands and
more nuclear reactors are put in opera-
tion, we can expect the availability of
large amounts of suitable low-cost waste-
products from these installations."
Dr. Engstrom pointed out that previous
proposals for largescale electrical power
generation from the fission of uranium in
a reactor have been based on an indirect
method. By that method, the tremendous
amount of heat energy created by the fis-
sion is used to produce steam, which
drives a turbine, which in turn drives a
conventional electrical generator. But in
contrast, RCA's laboratory method of con-
verting nuclear energy to electrical energy
is a direct conversion.
"Hitherto, power from the atom has
been used in much the same way as coal
in the furnace of an electric power plant,"
said Dr. Engstrom. "All the remainder of
the plant remained unchanged—boilers,
and an engine or turbine driving a mas-
sive electric generator. Only the nature
of the fuel was altered when nuclear
energy replaced coal or oil.
"But, if the promise of the Atomic
Battery is ultimately fulfilled on a large
scale, the power plant of that day would
THE ATOMIC BATTERY
(Continued from page 11)
have only an atomic generator connected
directly to cables carrying to far-flung
communities the power needed for the
multitudinous purposes of peace. Boilers,
engines, and electric generators would
then increasingly become elements of the
past.
"Naturally, much fundamental work
and applied research remains to be done
and many years will elapse before such
a goal is attained. Nevertheless, this
prospect offers a bright hope for man-
kind."
Technical Information
Dr. Engstrom added the following
technical information:
The new type of battery consists of a
radioactive source to which is coupled a
wafer of semi-conducting crystal (ger-
manium or silicon). An impurity material
has been alloyed into the crystal to form
a junction. The junction is similar elec-
trically to those used in a junction tran-
sistor, but is considerably larger, with an
area of l/20th of a square inch.
Strontium-90, one of the most abun-
dant of the materials resulting from the
fission of uranium in a reactor, is a
highly active source of beta particles—
high speed electrons—and is one of the
long-lived beta-emitting substances. Its
half-life is roughly 20 years, i.e., every
twenty years half of its radioactivity is
dissipated.
In the battery, 1/300th of a cubic
centimeter of radioactive strontium is
spread in a thin layer against the junction
wafer. The layer of strontium bombards
the semi-conducting crystal wafer with
several billion electrons per second. As
the electrons penetrate the wafer they
release many more electrons, an average
of 200,000 for each bombarding electron.
Previous radioactive generators simply
captured the highspeed electrons as they
came from the radioactive source with the
result that they provided approximately
one electron for each bombarding elec-
tron. In our present experimental atomic
battery, each highspeed electron releases
in the crystal, on the average, 200,000
lowspeed electrons. These released elec-
trons flow across the wafer's junction pro-
ducing a voltage which can be applied to
an electronic circuit and cause a current to
flow. The electron action within the crys-
tal wafer is known as the electron-voltaic
effect, a phenomenon of solid-state
physics which heretofore has not been
put to any practical use.
Why Strontium-90 Is Used
When connected to the transistor os-
cillator circuit, the battery's 1/5 volt
potential provides a current of 5 micro-
amperes, an output of approximately one
millionth of a watt. The best efficiency of
energy conversion so far obtained exceeds
1%, i.e., the ratio of useful electrical
power developed by the battery is at least
1/ 100th the energy of the beta particles
as they leave the radioactive source. The
greater part of the original energy is lost
as heat in the crystal wafer. As present
techniques are refined, an efficiency of
10% appears to be a reasonable goal for
such devices.
Greater power can be achieved by in-
creasing the present 500 millicurie quan-
tity of strontium-90 or by placing a num-
ber of such units in a single container.
Although in theory, virtually any radio-
active material could be the source of an
atomic battery, strontium-90 was chosen
to activate the RCA device because of its
high energy beta radiation, its relatively
long life, its low shielding requirements
and its availability in experimental quan-
tities from the U. S. Atomic Energy Com-
mission.
Strontium-90 is not now obtainable in
completely purified form, i.e., other fis-
sion products have not been entirely sep-
arated from it. Since some of the unwant-
ed radioactive materials are emitters of
gamma radiation, shielding is necessary in
the laboratory device.
However, strontium-90 in purified
form, emits only beta particles which, for
the quantities that would be used in a
small atomic battery, does not raise prob-
lems of shielding.
Strontium-90 costs about 50 cents for a
thousandth of a curie today. A wide de-
mand for the material in atomic batteries
and other applications would warrant
quantity processing of the material. This,
it has been estimated, might bring its
price down as low as two-tenths of a
cent for a thousandth of a curie.
An aspect of Atomic Batteries that has
yet to be determined accurately is the ex-
tent of the effect of the beta radiation on
the crystal wafer. It is known that the
crystal structure of many substances is
gradually damaged by bombarding elec-
trons. Further research is in progress to
minimize these effects so as to make
them negligible for the structures used
in the Atomic Battery.

It takes tons and tons of materials
to fill the prescriptions that give strength and stamina to the steel you use
The steel that's everywhere—in your automobile, in
trains, machines, and buildings—is stronger and more
enduring because it has been treated with special
"vitamins and tonics."
STEEL GETS ITS VITAMINS from the industry's
"drugstores"—the plants where alloying metals are
made. Here, prescriptions usually call for ingredients
by the ton. Their huge "mixing bowls" are white-hot
electric arc furnaces, in which temperatures reach over
3,500 degrees Fahrenheit.
These alloying metals are refined and concentrated
forms of both rare and common metals. Among them
are chromium, boron, silicon, tungsten, columbium, and
vanadium. Individually, or together, they give steel du-
rability, toughness, hardness, rust and corrosion resist-
ance, and other special qualities. Chromium, for exam-
ple, is the secret of making steel stainless.
VARYING COMBINATIONS of these and other
alloys are added to every ton of molten steel produced
today. Without them we wouldn't have the hundreds
of different kinds of steel that do so much for all of us
in so many ways.
MORE THAN 50 ALLOYS—The people of Union
Carbide pioneered in the development and production
of alloying metals. They produce more than 50 different
alloys for steel and other metals that go into products
that serve you.

more than six thousand pages have been
published with the Institute's imprint,
roughly one-third of which are in book
form and two-thirds of which have been
issued during the last three years. Almost
two years ago, in recognition of the high
quality of its publications, the Institute
was authorized to issue its books and
bulletins under the added imprint of the
University of Michigan Press.
Other results of sponsored research
have been disseminated through scientific
and technical journals, the transactions of
professional societies, and symposia. Since
1920, there have appeared in print about
one thousand such contributions.
A third type of scholarly contribution
that has grown out of sponsored basic
research is the doctoral dissertation. It is
apparent that when a graduate student
(after having made arrangements with
the sponsor) takes some phase of his re-
search and develops it into a dissertation
acceptable to the University, the sponsor
gets an especially valuable study.
Patents
Workers engaged in sponsored Insti-
tute research have not infrequently de-
veloped a patentable discovery or inven-
tion. In 1928 an equitable patent policy
was established, and in 1942 the present
patents agreement was put into effect.
This thoroughly workable agreement pro-
motes the public welfare and at the same
time the interests of the sponsor and the
University.
Government Research
In 1942, very soon after the attack on
Pearl Harbor, the Regents of the Univer-
sity approved the acceptance of the first
Government-sponsored research contract,
and since then the Institute has been
carrying on more and more research for
Government agencies, especially the arm-
ed services, until during the past three
years such research constituted over ninety
per cent of all sponsored activities. The
large ratio of Government research to
industrial research—the latter, incident-
ly, has also increased quite in line with
the nation-wide sponsored-research pic-
ture.
While a large portion of Government
research, especially that carried on at the
Willow Run Research Center, is con-
cerned with problems of national defense,
much of it is of a fundamental nature
(Continued from page 13)
and will eventually, no doubt, prove of
direct benefit also to industry. Besides,
several Government agencies, notably the
Office of Naval Research and the Atomic
Energy Commission, have been support-
ing important fundamental research in
such fields as mathematics, psychology,
and physics.
Research Costs and Staff
It is impossible to estimate even rough-
ly the value of thirty-three years of Insti-
tute research as to its potential importance
in industry and engineering and its na-
tional impact on society. However, the
costs that went into this research are a
yardstick of what sponsors were willing
to invest to build up our store of basic
knowledge or to obtain answers to in-
dustrial problems. During the first year,
1920-21, about $20,000 worth of research
was done. By 1930 the amount had risen
to over $300,000. Then, owing to the de-
pression, it dropped for a number of
years, and it was not until 1941-42 that
the previous high was again reached. In
1950 research costs amounted to over 2y2
million dollars and in 1951 to over 3
million; the next year they more than
doubled, and during 1952-53 they reach-
ed the impressive total of $8,370,780.
The grand total for the years 1920 to
1953 is approximately 35 million dollars,
which represents sponsorship of 2170
projects.
To carry on the research activities of
the Institute a large staff is needed. The
average monthly employment was 1235,
varying from 1136 in September, 1952 to
1355 in April, 1953. Slightly over forty
per cent of the total were employed at
the Willow Run Research Center. Less
than one-third of the total were part-
time employees consisting of faculty and
graduate and undergraduate students.
The Financial Picture
The volume of research carried on dur-
ing the year 1952-53 amounts to
$8,370,780, of which $6,835,939 is for
direct costs and $1,534,841 for indirect
costs. The total represents an increase of
28 per cent over the figure reported last
year. This growth is due largely to in-
creased sponsorship of research by the
Federal Government, although the
amount of industry-sponsored research
also increased (slightly over 10 per cent).
The number of projects on which re-
search was conducted is 339. Of these,
70 were completed and 173 were initiated
during the year, leaving 269 projects,
with contractual obligations of over five
million dollars (of which nearly one-half
million is for industrial research), to be
carried over into 1953-54.*
Of the 339 projects, 80 were worked
on in divisions of the University other
than the College of Engineering and the
Willow Run Research Center. The re-
search costs of these 80 projects amount-
ed to nearly one million dollars.
Institute Needs
The Director is convinced that during
the next few years, an increasing amount
of research will be carried on throughout
the country; after that, it will probably
level off and then remain relatively con-
stant for some time. Unless something un-
foreseeable should happen, the amount
of research that the Engineering Research
Institute will be called upon to do will in
all likelihood follow the national trend.
At any rate, it is extremely unlikely that
there will be a decided cutback of Insti-
tute research activities in the near future.
For many years the quarters available
for sponsored research have been inade-
quate in many respects. The removal of
some project work to the Cooley Mem-
orial Building will take care of some of
the immediate space requirements. How-
ever, there is still a great need for in-
creased space for administrative offices
and office services, both in the East Engi-
neering Building and in the Engineering
Research Institute Office Services Build-
ing.
These activities must continue to be
housed on or very near the campus so
that the necessary close cooperation can
be maintained with the faculty and the
University administrative and business
office.
Also, the many visitors to the Institute
who have only a few hours to spend for
the transaction of their business should
be accommodated by having at least the
administrative offices located on, or with-
in reasonable walking distance of, the
campus.
* The increase in the number of projects re-
ported here, compared with those reported last
year, is due in part to the fact that this year
for the first time the subprojects are indudtJ
in the count.

The many lineal inches of contact

unusually high load rating. In
fact, a Needle Bearing has greater
radial capacity in relation to its

The exceptional load capacity of
the Needle Bearing is the result
of proper selection of steels, pre-

modern anti-friction principles.

TECHNICAL WRITING
OPPORTUNITIES
(Continued from page 11)
these magazines works much the same as an editor on one
of the technical magazines. The principal difference is in his
"beat." In the case of the company technical magazine, the
"beat" is largely within the company with only an occasional
trip outside. No such limitation is faced by the editor on a
technical magazine. So, if you are averse to frequent and ex-
tensive travel, but want to be in the technical writing profes-
sion, a job on a company published technical periodical might
be the solution to your problem.
Public Relations Work
The work of a technical editor-writer in the public relations
department of a corporation is quite different from that of a
staff editor on a technical magazine—yet, under the right
conditions it can be as challenging, as stimulating mentally,
and as rewarding financially. We can best illustrate what we
mean by describing the Technical Publicity operation at West-
inghouse.
A sizeable staff of editor-writers gather, edit, and place in
technical magazines and the Westinghouse Engineer technical
information about Westinghouse products and services. To do
this, each editor-writer is assigned a "beat" of two or
three product divisions and one or two engineering service
departments. The editor-writer establish personal contact with
those doing research, development, design, manufacturing and
application engineering work, keep fully acquainted with the
progress of developments and guide the planning of publicity
for all developments. This includes giving counsel to authors
of technical or engineering articles, gathering information and
writing news items, new products and sales literature pieces,
and similar items of interest to the readers of technical maga-
zines. They assist in planning visual aids, sometimes personally
directing the taking of photographs. In addition, they must
obtain clearances for publication from interested groups within
the Company. They must also plan and assume the respon-
sibility of placement of material with the editors of the ap-
propriate technical magazines.
In the case of technical articles and write-ups to appear in
the Westinghouse Engineer, the editor-writer, working with
the managing editor and production department, prepare the
manuscript for printing, plans and assists the art department
with the illustrations. In short, re-works the story through the
actual printing, including proofreading.
This is the basic function. There are others. The editor-
writers help plan and execute meetings with groups of editors
for the disclosure of a new development or for the exchange
of enginering information. They arrange and schedule visits
for editors of technical magazines with Company engineers,
executives, or plants. Random activities include assistance to
authors of books, assistance in preparing talks by Company
executives, and trips to customers' installation to gather in-
formation or to assist in taking pictures.
While all technical information operations of corporations
may not embrace all the activities found at Westinghouse.
basically all do the same thing in varying degrees. The scope
is determined largely by the size of the company. In general,
the larger the company, the broader the scope. Conversely, the
smaller the company, the narrower the scope.

What holds for corporation public re-
lations departments, holds also for public
relations departments of advertising
agencies. Here, editorial and advertising
functions are more closely related as both
are frequently handled by the same per-
son for the same client company. In gen-
eral, agency work involves more fact gath-
ering and creative writing than is the case
with the corporation. Of interest is the
fact that a few agencies have set up a
technical information group separate and
distinct from their advertising depart-
ment.
Continuing Education
In a way, technical writing offers a
continuing education. The successful
editor will observe first hand practical
engineering from concept of idea to op-
eration of equipment. This requires keep-
ing abreast of developments in the specific
and corollary fields.
Such a job develops your powers of ob-
servation and discernment . . . your ability
to draw out a person, to get him to talk
about the things that interest him most
. . . and finally, your ability to report all
you see and hear to your readers. To do
these things well means you must go
beyond "merely being interested in de-
velopments." You must catch the signifi-
cance of the development: what will its
import be on related developments; what
is the trend-meaning of the development?
To do this kind of interpretative report-
ing job requires imaginative thinking
coupled with a genuine liking for people.
Unless you are blessed with both, this
technical writing business is not for you.
There is one more aspect of this busi-
ness that must be considered. It is this:
technical writing by its nature precludes a
very intensive understanding of any given
subject. For anyone who wishes to learn
the intimate aspects of a given phase of
engineering, the profession of technical
writing should be avoided. For the most
part the work is done at a fairly high
speed on a rigid schedule and time is not
available for the full explanation of a
subject that appeals to the more technical-
ly-minded individual.
Qualifications Needed for a
Technical Writer
First is engineering education. It is
essential that a technical editor have had
a formal engineering education. Naturally
(Continued from page 32)
within the Westinghouse Company, with
the emphasis on electrical matters, we
look for graduate electrical engineers as
the editor-writers work directly with de-
sign and application engineers and there-
fore, must be able to "talk their lan-
guage." They must win the confidence of
the engineers, have a fair understanding
of the matter under discussion, and be
able to judge the engineering significance
of a particular development.
Of 32 technical and trade magazine
editors polled on this question, all but
two required an engineering degree.
These two preferred a B.A. in business
administration to journalism. All prefer-
red an engineering graduate with one to
five years experience in industry to an
engineering graduate just out of college.
This experience is needed to help the
editor more accurately interpret the sig-
nificance of a development.
Next is journalistic skill. An editor
must have a facility as a writer. This is
sometimes called "wordsmithing." This
requirement is less tangible than the engi-
neering training required but no less im-
portant. In essence, it means a facility in
handling words, a liking for writing, and
an ability to express ideas clearly, inter-
estingly, and logically. Also, this skill
must extend not only to one's own writ-
ing but in addition, to one's editing for
frequently a critical view must be taken
of the writings of others.
How well someone meets these qualifi-
cations generally is hard to measure but
it is extremely important. It must be based
on something more than on a vague but
common "desire to write." Words are
tools of the technical editor. Unless he
uses them with pleasure and with facility,
he is a misfit in technical writing.
Next is imagination. A technical editor
must possess imagination in abundance.
He must be able to see in a development
a potential story that will be of interest
to the well-defined audience. This is some-
times called having a "nose for news."
Really it is much more than that. It means
visualizing a potential story that will have
a particular appeal and of enthusing the
project engineer over the article possibili-
ties so he will write the piece for you. In
addition, as the story develops, it means
seeing ways of treating the facts or sup-
plementing the text with visual aids,
either photographic or otherwise, that
will add to the reader's interest in the
story. The editor, in short, must not only
have in mind the author's point of view,
but also a very specific reader's point of
view.
Then there is diplomacy. An editor
must possess considerable tact or those
personal mannerism qualities usually as-
ssociated with a successful salesman. An
editor contacting engineers must be able,
by persuasive methods, to obtain their co-
operation in the preparation of articles or
the presentation of facts. Because engi-
neers are busy and are not too prone to
write, considerable skill to win their re-
spect and confidence for the projects in
mind is essential.
Finally, there is cooperativeness. Be-
cause a technical editor is part of an or-
ganization, he obviously must have these
qualities that are necessary in almost any
organizational activity. This is the ability
to get along well with fellow editors and
other members of the organization, and
to win their respect and confidence. These
involve such things as punctuality, cour-
tesy, personal neatness, and teamwork.
While these seem obvious, otherwise good
editors have been known to flounder on
some of these personal qualifications.
A few random thoughts on qualifica-
tions from the editors polled. "We look
for dependability, ability to produce, ini-
tiative and aggressiveness . . ." ". . . must
have a good command of the King's
English." ". . . he must have a good
'nose-for-news' . . ." ". . . he must know
what is and is not worth reporting." "He-
must have a missionary's zeal to bring
the reader little-known facts . . . must
have a passion for accuracy and logic."
"He must have writing ability, must pro-
duce ideas, must have an interviewing
ability, must have good analytical ability,
and of course be a team player."
Job Hunting
Where you want to be in the technical
writing profession will determine your
approach to the job. Basically what you
do to land a job as an editor on a techni-
cal magazine will differ only in detail to
what must be done to get on the public-
relations staff of a corporation.
First of all you must find out all you
can about the magazine of your choice:
the owner, the publisher, the editor, the
editorial content and philosophy, and the
number of readers and who they are.

INobody can buy a length of cast iron pipe
unless it has passed the Hydrostatic Test at the foundry.
Every full length of cast iron pipe is subjected to this
test under water pressures considerably higher than
rated working pressures. It must pass the test or go
to the scrap pile.
The Hydrostatic Test is the final one of a series of
routine tests made by pipe manufacturers to assure
that the quality of the pipe meets or exceeds the re-
quirements of standard specifications for cast iron
pressure pipe.
Few engineers realize the extent of the inspections,
analyses and tests involved in the quality-control of
cast iron pipe. Production controls start almost liter-
ally from the ground up with the inspection, analysis
and checking of raw materials—continue with con-
stant control of cupola operation and analysis of the
melt—and end with inspections and a series of accept-
ance and routine tests of the finished product.
Members of the Cast Iron Pipe Research Associa-
tion have established and attained scientific standards
resulting in a superior product. These standards, as
well as the physical and metallurgical controls by
which they are maintained, provide assurance that

The need to do this, and do it well is
great. You'll benefit personally as you'll
learn things you should know about a
company you may someday be working
for. Furthermore, it will be a lot easier to
build your case if you have an intelligent
understanding of what is expected of an
editor on that magazine. The problem
then of evaluating your education, experi-
ence and ability in terms of the magazine
will be relatively simple. Remember this:
The editor must have visible evidence and
a good reason for hiring you. Make this
part of his job easy by a thorough study
of his magazine.
The best visible evidence you can mus-
ter is a portfolio of examples of your
creative writing. Since every editor looks
for genuine evidence on the part of the
applicant that he can write, there is no
better proof of this than samples of your
own work. Include material from your
high-school days if you have any as this
is evidence that you have demonstrated a
special interest in writing early in life. Be-
sure to include plenty of samples from
college.
(Continued from page .14)
Direct your original letter of applica-
tion to the editor. Attach to this a bio-
graphical profile that includes personal
and experience data. Indicate your desire
to see him personally. Take advantage of
the study you've made of his magazine
and tersely interpret your abilities in
terms of his magazine. Do this for several
magazines if you want to uncover quick-
ly one or more openings.
You'll need to make the same kind of
study of corporations and agencies. Also,
the same kind of preparation of your case.
Since most large corporations send in-
terviewers to college campuses, this makes
possible a personal discussion of the op-
portunities for technical writing with the
college interviewer. If he is unable to
answer your questions to your complete
satisfaction, find out from him the person
with whom you should communicate to
get these answers. Then write that person.
Where a corporation does not send an
interviewer to a college campus, and you
know from your study of the company
that it has a public relations department,
write the public relations director. Write
him in the same vein suggested for the
letter to the editor.
Remember this about job hunting:
never pass up a detail about your edu-
cation, experience and ability that can
add a plus to your case. The better you
package your biographic profile, the bet-
ter the reader acceptance it gets. And, the
better the reader acceptance the better im-
pressions you create. Since impressions
help land jobs, create all the good ones
you can.
In Summary
We think technical writing should be
looked upon as a separate profession; a
profession that requires its own talents,
skills, opportunities and responsibilities.
It is an important profession. It should
not be viewed as a position in which an
individual is on the sidelines watching
the engineering parade go by. The task
of converting information about the engi-
neering developments into printed form
usable by the profession generally is as
important in the complex industrial world
as the creation of the idea itself.

heating within the means of literally mil-
lions of people.
One of the reasons for the seemingly
slow development of the Weathertron
since 1932 is that it had to wait for the
development of residential air condition-
ing. The Weathertron is not, in general,
a direct competitor to conventional auto-
matic heating. Except for conditions such
as extremely mild climate, or high fuel
cost as compared to electric power, there
is little if any economic advantage to a
Weathertron for heating alone. However,
when the Weathertron is not considered
as a heating machine but as a machine for
providing year-round air conditioning,
that is, both cooling and heating, its real
economic usefulness begins to emerge,
and the recent rapidly rising trend toward
complete year-round air conditioning of
residences has focused new attention on
the Heat Pump.
Year-round air conditioning provided
by Weathertrons includes heating in win-
ter, cooling and drying in summer, air
filtering, circulation and ventilation.
These functions are accomplished elec-
trically, under automatic control, without
combustion and without fuel in the ordin-
ary sense.
To better understand the operation of
the G-E Weathertron, one must keep in
mind four basic laws of nature, namely:
1. Heat exists in the air at all tempera-
tures—below freezing as well as above—
all the way down to absolute zero
(—459°F). 2. Heat always tends to flow
from a higher temperature to a lower one.
3. All gases cool on expansion and be-
come warmer when compressed. 4. Heat
is absorbed when a liquid changes to
vapor and heat is given off when vapor
condenses to a liquid.
Your ordinary household refrigerator
utilizes these laws of nature in its opera-
tion every day and the basic principle of
the Weathertron is the same as that of an
electrically operated refrigerator.
In a refrigerator heat is drawn from
the food stored inside by evaporating a
liquid refrigerant passing through a coil
inside the box. The heat-bearing refriger-
ant gas is then compressed and pumped
to another coil on the outside of the box
where the gas condenses to a liquid and
the heat is given up to the room (place
your hand behind your refrigerator when
it is running and you will notice that it
is warmer than the rest of the room). The
IN THE NEWS
(Continued from page 22)
cooled refrigerant then returns to the in-
side coil to pick up more heat and repeat
the cycle.
The Weathertron works the same. In
winter it expands a refrigerant and sends
it through a coil where it extracts heat
from the outdoor air. The heat laden
refrigerant gas is then compressed and
pumped through another coil and the
heat is released into the house. Air from
the house is blown through the refriger-
ant coils at this point. The air absorbs
the heat from the tubes in the coil and
warms the rooms as it is gently circu-
lated.
The main difference between the re-
frigerator and the Weathertron, other
than the difference in their capacities, is
that the Weathertron is built to automati-
cally reverse its cycle of operation so that
in summer, heat is picked up from inside
the house and dumped outdoors.
The addition of equipment such as
blowers, filters, controls, etc., completes
the Weathertron. Ordinary ductwork de-
livers the warmed or cooled air through-
out the house. An ideal system for distri-
bution of air within the space served de-
livers heated or cooled air upward in a
fan-like pattern low along the walls of
the rooms that are exposed to the out-
doors. Return air is taken from grills in
interior partition walls.
The Weathertron principle is not limit-
ed to the use of air for heating or cool-
ing. It is also possible to take heat from
the ground, deep wells, or ground water.
The use of ground coils as a heat
source has practical limitations for use
with Heat Pumps. In addition to the ex-
pense of installing a ground coil, there
are so many variables (such as soil com-
position and moisture content) involved
that each ground coil has to be individual-
ly engineered and even then you may not
be sure of the results.
Well water is a good heat source since
its temperature is fairly constant through-
out the year. However, in many sections
of the country ground water is not read-
ily available and the cost of providing
a well of sufficient capacity may be pro-
hibitive. Also in the event a deep well is
used considerable power may be con-
sumed in pumping water.
So from an over-all standpoint, weigh-
ing the advantages and disadvantages,
G.E. elected to make an air-to-air unit.
The prime advantages are that air is uni-
versally available, is easy to move in
sufficient quantities and results are rela-
tively predictable. In addition it permitted
development of a truly packaged unit,
sort of a large domestic appliance ma-
chine, which is ideally suited for the mass
market.
The G-E Weathertron is compact in
size and can pass through a 28-inch door.
It can be placed in almost any location,
garage, basement, alcove; any place that
is convenient to the homeowner. Since it
does not burn any combustible fuel, its
location is not dependent on a chimney,
and in fact, the house does not need a
chimney. The flexibility and function of
the Weathertron can have a profound
influence on future home design.
Although General Electric is making
its long range bid for the residential
market it is not overlooking the commer-
cial market. Many installations made in
the past year have been in small stores
and restaurants. Others are successfully-
heating and cooling clinics and other pro-
fessional offices. The unit proves to be
especially well suited to these applications.
Commercial installations are relatively
simple. In some instances ductwork is not
necessary and the unit is practically
plugged in and operated. It can be placed
in a corner of the store in space, or out-
of-space. With a Weathertron, the mer-
chant, in addition to the other benefits
of the unit, has his heating and cooling
in one package, instead of having his
heating plant downstairs and his cooling
plant upstairs as now is the case in
most stores.
Public response to G-E's initial Weath-
ertron marketing effort has been very
good. So good, in fact, that the sales
goal for the first year was easily topped.
As a result G-E stepped up its program
for 1953 at a faster rate than originally-
anticipated. Encouraged by this good start
G-E officials are more than ever convinced
that the Weathertron has a bright future
ahead of it.
H. M. Brundage, general manager of
the G-E Weathertron Department in
Bloomfield, N.J., says, "We are living
in an electrical age. People are thinking
electrically. It took years for radio to get
started, but look how television has blos-
somed almost overnight. The Weather-
tron may be in general use sooner than
many of us now think possible."
Right now the initial cost of the
Weathertron—from 15-25 per cent more

THE PROBLEM:
To design and manufacture advanced radar and fire control
systems for military all-weather fighters and interceptors-
equipment that must he light in weight, versatile, and capable
of accurate operation day or night under extreme conditions.
At Hughes the answers to these requirements for complexly interacting system?
involving advanced radar and fire control have been under continuing developmeni
from 1948 and in production since 1949. Even more advanced systems are cur-
rently in process of development for supersonic aircraft.
Beginning with systems engineering and analysis, the military studies are initially
concerned with evaluation of the strategic and tactical needs of the services in order
to establish design objectives. This is followed by the analysis of problems involving
noise, smoothing and prediction, multi-loop nonlinear servos, aircraft dynamics
and controls, and the properties peculiar to conversion of analog information
to digital quantities. From the analytic stage evolve the requirements for systems
design and circuitry, designs of computing sub-systems, microwave transmitting
and receiving equipment, the presentation of information to an airplane pilot, and
advanced testing needed to optimize over-all system performance.

ditioning where heating is by gas or oil
—has confined it pretty much to houses
in the $20,000 and above range. But Mr.
Brundage believes it will be only a mat-
ter of time before mass production and
volume sales brings the initial cost down
to a competitive level.
Operating costs are already within
range of other fuels and in some areas
where power rates are unusually favor-
able, the Weathertron is even cheaper
to operate than conventional heating
plants. Generally, where power sells for
2 cents KWH or less, the Weathertron is
directly competitive with other forms of
fuel for heating. So far as summer cool-
ing is concerned, there is little difference
in operating costs between the Heat Pump
and standard air conditioning units, al-
though the Weathertron does have an
over-all advantage in that it doesn't use
any water.
In launching the Weathertron market-
ing program, General Electric first enter-
ed those southern areas where residential
cooling is considered a necessity and the
IN THE NEWS
(Continued from page 42)
public was ready for an advanced year-
round air conditioning unit like the
Weathertron. Since then residential year-
round air conditioning has progressed to
other areas of the country and the Com-
pany will soon be marketing the Weather-
tron in these new areas.
Electric utility companies are keenly in-
terested in the development of the Weath-
ertron. In making the all-electric home a
reality, it will have a terrific impact on
the sale of electrical appliances. Three
major appliances, for example, that can
be purchased either gas or electric are
the kitchen range, water heater and
clothes dryer. Installation of the Weather-
tron in a home would practically dictate
the selection of all electric appliances.
More important from the electric utility
viewpoint, the Heat Pump itself presents
tremendous possibilities for materially in-
creasing residential kilowatt hour sales.
Although there are over 400 million
electric consuming devices in the Ameri-
can homes today, the average residential
consumption of electricity, including
lightning, amounts to slightly more than

amount ranging from $75 to $500 a year
the average home owner spends on fuels
such as gas, oil and coal for heating alone
and gives an idea of the stake electric
utilities have in the development of the
Heat Pump.
General Electric, Mr. Brundage says, is
firmly convinced the Weathertron is the
home heating and cooling system of the
future. At the present time, the com-
pany is offering the Weathertron as the
last word in year-round air conditioning.
Minimizing the factor of initial cost,
Mr. Brundage, said: "when we eliminate
drudgery, inconvenience, dust, dirt, and
annoyance, etc., and in return supply com-
fort, convenience and cleanliness, which
all-electric year-round air conditioning
does, it is amazing how fast the Ameri-
can public responds. The American pub-
lic's well-known desire to have the best
will eventually broaden the market and
help bring the price down. Refrigerators
were once expensive."
The electrical industry, especially elec-
tric utilities and major electrical manufac-
turers have continued to bring electric
power and appliances, radio and televi-
sion, and similar devices for better elec-
tric living to more and more of the
people of the world over the years since
Edison first created the electric lamp.
The development of the Weathertron
fits that historical pattern of "Electricity
For Better Living."
Magnetic Domains Studied
to Cut Energy Losses
Furthering research into the causes of
energy losses in electric motor and trans-
former cores, scientists at U. S. Steel's Re-
search and Development Laboratory in
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, are conducting
an extensive study of magnetic domains
in electrical steels. Experimental work
on magnetic domains, or tiny oriented
magnetic areas within the crystals of steel,
was instituted by American scientists in
1932.
Power losses in transformers are at-
tributable to the characteristics of the
steel used in making the cores. These
losses are known as "core losses." There is
a measurable loss through hysteresis, or
lag behind the field when steel is magne-
tized by a magnetic field made to vary
through a cycle of values. Another loss is

tric currents which lower efficiency and
increase temperature of rotating metallic
objects in a magnetic field. These two
losses do not add up to the total core loss,
so a third, unknown cause is being sought.
This loss is called "anomalous loss."
Modern electric motors and transform-
ers have been brought to a high degree
of efficiency through the use of silicon
steels. These steels, first patented by Sir
Robert Hadfield about the year 1900, per-
mit the necessary alterations of the mag-
netic field without undue energy losses.
In addition, they possess increased elec-
trical resistance which diminishes that
part of the loss due to eddy currents.
They also exhibit relatively little aging
effect.
In most sheet products, directionality
of magnetic properties is undesirable, but
in certain applications in the electrical
industry it has a definite advantage. Cores
can be wound or transformer laminations
can be cut to take advantage of such di-
rectionality. Consequently, electrical
sheet manufacturers strive to develop this
characteristic to a high degree.
This directionality of magnetic proper-
ties is achieved through crystal orienta-
tion. A crystal is composed of a certain
periodic arrangement of the atoms of a
material, which in the case of silicon steel
takes the form of a cube with the iron
and silicon atoms located at the corners.
By closely controlled techniques of rolling
and heat treating every effort is made to
cause all, or at least most, of these cubes
to align themselves in the same direction.
This is accomplished to a high degree by
present methods of processing and the
best magnetic properties are in the roll-
ing direction.
It is believed that certain magnetic do-
main orientations might further improve
the directional properties of grain-
oriented steels. The present research into
magnetic domains is to determine their
characteristics and possibly to discover
ways to control their orientation.
In the laboratory, a test sample of steel
about the size of a dime is punched from
a sheet of steel being studied. This disc is
first mechanically polished and then
electropolished to insure an ultra-smooth
strain-free surface.
A drop of a colloidal suspension of
magnetite (Fe;l0,) is applied to the sur-
face and then faced with a glass cover
plate. Under a microscope the prepared
IN THE NEWS
(Continued from page 44)
disc is placed between the poles of an
electromagnet with the rolling direction
parallel to the direction of the applied
magnetic field. The minute magnetic solid
particles in the colloidal suspension are
attracted to the edges of the magnetic
areas within the crystals of the steel. They
form a clear outline of each domain and
make it possible for the scientist to see
the magnetic domain patterns within the
steel crystals.
As current is supplied to the magnet,
the domains form patterns determined by
the crystal orientation and the strength of
the applied magnetic field. In effect, the
research technologist can actually see and
study the process of magnetization.
The stage of the microscope is also
provided with a screw clamp so that the
test disc can be put under measured stress.
This makes it possible to study the effects
of mechanical strain on magnetic do-
mains.
"As in most pure research projects, the
end benefits of any discoveries made are
not clearly discernable. It is hoped, how-
ever, that out of the data being accumu-
lated a new and more efficient electrical
steel will be evolved," said George Pellis-
sier, research associate who is supervising
the magnetic domains studies.
General Electric Produces
World's Largest Light Bulb
General Electric announced here re-
cently that it had developed and produced
the world's largest and most impressive
artificial light source.
A 75,000-watt incandescent lamp bulb.
it is half again as large as the previous
largest bulb. It was developed as a fea-
ture of G.E.'s observance this year of the
75th birthday of Edison's most famous
invention.
This giant among light bulbs will be
turned on officially for Edison's 107th
birthday, during ceremonies at Rockefel-
ler Center, New York, overlooking the
skating rink. It will be displayed and
lighted throughout the year at Light's
Diamond Jubilee celebration and at con-
ventions, shows and fairs, in all sections
of the country.
The lamp was conceived, designed and
assembled by G-E lamp development
scientists and engineers here at Nela Park,
headquarters of G.E.'s Lamp Division.
Its glass bulb, largest ever made, was
hand blown by the Corning Glass Com-
pany, first producer of bulbs for Edison.
The lamp produces 2,400,000 lumens,
or units of light. To produce this amount
of light would require 2874 60-watt
household bulbs, all burning simultane-
ously. This single light bulb uses enough
electric energy to light 83 American
homes as they are normally lighted to-
day. Twenty-three of them could illu-
minate a major league baseball stadium
according to modern standards.
The lamp's filament alone weighs 2.7
pounds, which is enough tungsten to
make the coiled-coil filaments for 67,500
60-watt lamps. The filament is made of a
tungsten ingot, hammered to a diameter

While taking the course, two engi-
neers developed a revolutionary new
circuit breaker mechanism.
"Our experience shows what can happen
if you work with people open to sugges-
tion. We found men of this kind at Allis-
Chalmers, and it has given us a special
pleasure in our job.
"We started out like most other graduates
with a hazy idea of what we wanted to do.
After working in several departments, we
requested that part of our training be at
the Boston Works of Allis-Chalmers,
where circuit breakers are made."
New Design Principle
"Circuit breakers soon became an obses-
sion with us, and we got the idea of de-
signing a hydraulic operator and trigger-
ing mechanism for these breakers. Most
operators for big breakers are pneumatic.
"Unsuccessful attempts had been made
in the past by all circuit breaker manu-
facturers to build hydraulic operators.
Low-pressure spindle for a 120,000 kw
steam turbine generator. Said to be one
of the largest ever built in the United
States, this spindle is nearing completion
in the Allis-Chalmers West Allis shops.
The important thing is that no one at
Allis-Chalmers said, 'Don't try it—it won't
work.'"
Start New Era
"To make a long story short, our study of
the problem led us to the hydraulic accu-
mulator and high speed valves being used
by the aircraft industry. These had not
been available when earlier attempts were
made to build a hydraulic operator. With
these highly developed devices to work
with, we were able to build an operator
that combined the best features of pneu-
matic and hydraulic operation. We call it
the Pneu-draulic operator. Engineers are
saying it starts a new era in circuit breaker
actuation.
"This fact is important to us, but it is
even more important to know that Allis-
Chalmers Graduate Training Course is
full of opportunity . . . and as we found
out, there's opportunity right from the
start."
Pneu-draulic is an Allis-Chalmers Trademark.
Facts You Should Know About the
Allis-Chalmers Graduate Training Course
:;:
&amp;
1. It's well established, having been
started in 1904. A large percentage of
the management group are graduates
of the course.
2. The course offers a maximum of 24
months' training. Length and type of
training is individually planned.
3. The graduate engineer may choose
the kind of work he wants to do: design,
engineering, research, production, sales,
erection, service, etc.
4. He may choose the kind of power,
processing, specialized equipment or
industrial apparatus with which he will
work, such as: steam or hydraulic,
turbo-generators, circuit breakers, unit
substations, transformers, motors, con-
trol pumps, kilns, coolers, rod and ball
mills, crushers, vibrating screens, recti-
fiers, induction and dielectric heaters,
grain mills, sifters, etc.
5. He will have individual attention
and guidance in working out his train-
ing program.
6. The program has as its objective the
right job for the right man. As he gets
experience in different training loca-
tions he can alter his course of training
to match changing interests.

one-half feet long.
The filament was swaged at a G-E wire
factory in Cleveland, and the mount, or
framework which supports the filament,
was assembled in General Electric's Lamp
Development Laboratory at Nela Park,
where the lamp was completed and turn-
ed on and tested for the first time.
The huge lamp is so bright and hot
that observers are advised not to look
directly at it or stand close to it when
it is burning at full brilliance.
The first practical incandescent lamp
was invented by Edison just 75 years ago
next October 21. By today's standards it
was an inefficient light source, producing
only 1.4 lumens per watt of electricity
consumed. In contrast, the 75,000-watt
bulb gives out 32 lumens per watt, and is
one of the most efficient incandescent
light sources yet produced.
Three of the huge lamps will be on
display throughout the year, one at
Light's Diamond Jubilee celebrations, an-
other in the Lighting Institute at Nela
Park, and a third at exhibits, conventions
and fairs.
Underground Tunnel Construction Job
Speeded By Use of Mechanical Miner
Mechanical miners, designed for use in
the coal fields, are proving effective in
underground construction jobs, "Con-
struction Methods and Equipment" re-
ports.
One such machine, being used to dig a
2,800-foot water tunnel beneath the Ar-
kansas River, is doing the job twice as
fast as it could be done by conventional
methods. Pushing through shale, the ma-
chine is advancing a 7 x 12-foot bore an
average of 20 feet in eight hours, but best
progress is nearly double that figure.
Further planned remodeling of the min-
ing machine is expected to result in a
minimum 30 per cent increase in its effi-
ciency and in the addition of ten feet to
the average daily advance. Total under-
ground crew required is just five men.
The main digging elements of the ma-
chine are two propeller-like rotating cut-
ter-arms on the front, each driven by a
75-horsepower electric motor. The ma-
chine is supported by a sledge runner at
each of its four corners; these are fitted
with hydraulic jacks so the machine can
be raised, lowered or tilted in any direc-
tion.
IN THE NEWS
(Continued from page 48)
In a similar operation a continuous
mining machine was used to dig a sewer
tunnel. It cut a 12-foot circular bore
through medium-hard shale at well over
20 feet per eight-hour day. In this in-
stance, employment of the machine also
silenced complaints of near-by residents
who objected to noise and claimed dam-
age to their homes from the routine drill-
ing and blasting method used at the start
of the job.
B &amp; W Design Research Atomic Reactor
Oak Ridge, Tenn.—At the University
Research Reactor Conference held here
recently, J. W. Landis, of the Atomic-
Energy Division of The Babcock &amp; Wil-
cox Company, revealed that his company
has prepared a detailed design of a re-
search atomic reactor and is willing to
submit firm bids on both the manufacture
and installation of the reactor at any spot
in the United States.
"The initial cost of this reactor will be
considerably lower than had been thought
possible only a few months ago," Landis
said. "In fact, construction costs will be
below any previous designs of comparable
reactors and we believe it will be well
within the reach of any university or
company engaged in atomic energy re-
search."
He explained that the reactor is the
fluid fuel type and is expected to produce
heat energy in excess of 100 kilowatts. It
is based on a modification of a Los
Alamos design conceived by Dr. Lyle
Borst of the University of Utah. "We
believe that it will produce moderately
high power and flux with a minimum of
fissionable material," Mr. Landis said.
"Our best estimate as to the amount of
fuel required to operate at rated capacity
is something less than two kilograms of
U-235."
He went on to say that the reactor was
designed by Babcock &amp; Wilcox primarily
for colleges and other organizations en-
gaged in atomic research, but that it could
also be used, with government approval,
to produce radioactive isotopes for indus-
trial and medical use. It uses demineral-
ized light water as the coolant with con-
centrated uranyl sulphate as the fuel. This
type of reactor is inherently safe but
B &amp; W's design contains additional safety
devices.
The conference was attended by over
200 people representing various univer-
sities, industrial organizations and gov-
ernmental agencies.

and better methods and materials are
found.
Improvement in speed-torque charac-
teristics are still required, with a corre-
sponding reduction in starting current. A
more detailed study of the magnetic cir-
cuit with a thorough exploration of the
causes and the remedies for harmonic core
losses, operating noise and parasitic tor-
ques are needed.
The single phase motor has many very
interesting problems and its theory is con-
tinually under fire. The analyses of this
device is rendered complicated by virtue
of its non-linear parameters and non-
sinusoidal space distribution of m.m.f.
This narrative could go on and on re-
citing areas of work for the Power Engi-
neer, but we must bring this to a close. In
Electrical Engineering, the Power Engi-
neer is the older brother of the newer and
younger offsprings. Occasionally he may
appear to be a little complacent and self-
satisfied, but he is nevertheless an im-
portant individual in the progress of civi-
lization. He must be a mixture of tech-
nologist and economist, and also rub
noses with other engineers in the fields.
and often learn the art and trick of cut-
ting corners so that he may save a cent
here and there so that he can under sell
his competitor.
Finally all types of Electrical Engineers
are members of a fine body of people
and the profession is a wonderful one to
follow. In academic training the study
should be careful. Plowing deep furrows
of analytical disciplines in whatever
course work may be taken, rather than
wide superficial samplings here and there.
The student should look toward wide
horizons and not at his feet.
Engineering has a fine heritage, a vast
store of literary and scientific knowledge,
and an opportunity for service to man-
kind the second to no other profession.

An appreciation of the problems associated with the application ol theoretical knowledge to practical jobs
is an important part of the engineering student's training. This is particularly true of radio engineering where,
in practice, many anomalous effects occur which never appear on a classroom blackboard. The radio com-
munications laboratory shown in the above photograph introduces electrical engineering students to some
of these problems. In the foreground a group of students is engaged in measurement of the frequency of
a radio signal, and to the left another group is investigating the problem of efficiently delivering power to a
load at very high frequencies. Other laboratories in the Electrical Engineering Department are devoted to
work in power and machinery, automatic controls, illumination, industrial electronics, measurements, vacuum
tubes, servomechanisms and computers. In addition to the purely instructional laboratories, research groups
are working in laboratories devoted to the study of solid state devices, high altitude rockets and the develop-
ments of new electronic devices.
The Electrical Engineering curriculum, in addition to the basic background required for all engineering
students, consists of fundamental training in electrical circuits and machinery, measurements, electric and
magnetic fields, and electron devices. During his senior year, a student may specialize to a limited extent in
machinery, automatic controls, power generation and transmission, electron tubes, or radio communication.
Graduate training permits the student to extend his study in these fields or to study problems in the areas of
servomechanisms, digital and analog computers, nuclear engineering, circuit synthesis, microwave engi-
neering, physical electronics, electric and magnetic properties of materials, electroacoustics, instrumenta-
tion, power systems and stability, illumination, antennas and propagation, and information theory.

'I HAVEN'T ANY TIME'
Without a doubt the greatest decisions in an engi-
neering student's life are those pertaining to his fu-
ture career. During his four or five years in college he
will ask himself many times, "How can I best prepare
myself for a promising career? How can I best utilize
my time at college? What should I study? How much
time should I spend studying? Last but not least, how
much time should I spend or, better, how much time
can I afford to spend on extra-curricular work?"
Most students are very much aware of how they
need to apply themselves to their formal studies, but
it is a small minority which grasps the significance,
importance, and benefit that comes from engaging in
some form of outside administrative and govern-
mental activity. It is human nature to rationalize
about doing extra work, especially when the benefit
derived is quite intangible and the rate of return is
an individual proposition, not a set wage pattern
based upon the precise amount of work to be done.
I think each and every student will agree that promi-
nence in any field of endeavor cannot be measured
by a set scale based on dollars, hours, or quantity of
work completed. In addition to this, I am sure he will
acknowledge that successful (not necessarily famous)
men in any field are foresighted individuals who do
not base their decisions concerning how much time
they should spend at various activities on monetary
gain alone or on the need to meet the minimum
standard of society. They can see beyond this mini-
mum standard and consequently devote much time to
work and study not actually required for earning a
reasonable wage or, such as the case in college, an
acceptable grade.
At this point you are probably saying to yourself,
"This may all be true, but what has this got to do
with me? I'm studying, I'm receiving good marks,
and by studying Engineering I have a very promising
future."
True, in our present society you do have a very
promising future in becoming an Engineer; even bet-
ter, you are preparing yourself for a career held in
high esteem ever since the beginning of civilization,
but are you really doing as much as you could? Are
you doing the most you could to improve your educa-
tion, your vision, your understanding of human
problems, and more important, are you making a
worthwhile contribution to the society of which you
are an integral part? Or are you one who, when ap-
proached to contribute some time or even just interest
in and support for an issue at hand, offers these four,
very often used words, "I haven't any time?"
If you are just such an individual, stop and put
these questions to yourself: How much time do I
have? How many hours per day, per week, or per
month do I actually spend attending school? If you
really think about it, you will find it is not quite so
many as it would seem to be.
"Well, so I have some extra time; I'll spend it do-
ing some additional work, but only if I feel I should.
What should I do? How can I best utilize this time,
and what benefit shall I derive from spending my
spare time in such a manner?
If you will look about you I am sure you will find
the answer. The campus, your own school, abounds
with opportunities for you to take part in extra-cur-
ricular work which would prove beneficial not only
to you but to your fellow students as well. There are
many organizations in the Engineering College which
desperately need manpower, student interest, and sup-
port; in turn they offer you unique educational oppor-
tunities relative to the engineering field and society as
a whole. They offer excellent opportunities to educate
yourself and to try your skill at administration, per-
sonnel management, planning, supervising; these
and many other experiences most vital and very
necessary if you are planning to achieve a prominent
position in your chosen field.
Wellington said that the Battle of Waterloo was
won on the playing fields of Eton, and it is in this
same light that representatives of business will look
at you. Business and corporation are most eager to
find men who indicate a willingness to accept respon-
sibility; men who are willing to extend themselves
beyond the realm of their "regular" job. In a recent
survey it was shown quite conclusively that the only
positive basis upon which personnel representatives
could predict how good an individual would prove to
be after graduation was how much extra work he
had done in school.
Do not think, however, that I am saying to forget
your school work and plunge into extra-curricular
activity; on the contrary, good marks in themselves
are indicative of initiative and a firm purpose. But I
do ask you to look about you; nine times out of ten
the men who are presidents of organizations, stu-
dent leaders, or representatives of your college are
also good students. Therefore, I ask that the next
time you feel the urge to participate or are asked to
help out with something, don't shrug it off with, "I
haven't any time!"
There is a real need and many opportunities for
each student to take part in student government and
student activities. Think about it first and remember
a saying of Admiral Byrd's concerning his arctic ex-
pedition: "Under the rigors of the arctic we found
wells of resource within us never tapped before and
that there are such wells of resource within an indi-
vidual never tapped in a life time."
Don't sit waiting for someone to ask you to help
out. Look around, find something you think you'd
like to do or have been afraid to spend time at before.
Give it a try; you'll enjoy it, and you'll never know-
when some small experience now may benefit you
later on in life.

Here are ten typical fastening problems. One device, the
ELASTIC STOP nut, solves them all—without additional parts
or operations. Deliberately undersized in relation to bolt diameter,
the red elastic collar grips the bolt with a perfect fit, exerting
a continuing self-locking pressure against the threads, and
holding the nut securely in place at any point on the bolt. It also
provides a tight seal against the bolt threads, which prevents
seepage and wear-producing axial play. And because the bolt threads
are protected against moisture from without, the nuts are
not "frozen" to the bolt by corrosion.
ELASTIC STOP nuts stay tight, right where you put them, in spite of
vibration and stress reversals. Yet they are not jammed in place, and can be
removed with a wrench and reused many times.

THE IDEAL ENVIRONMENT FOR YOUNG ENGINEERS
In 1953, Sylvania's 40 plants in eleven states pro-
duced upwards of $300 million worth of products
in more than sixty categories of lighting, radio,
television and electronics equipment.
This year will see the completion of additional
new plants and laboratories, as another phase of a
continuing expansion program which has doubled
plant and equipment in the past few years.
As a graduate engineer, you'll naturally find a
wide range of opportunities in every phase of
engineering at Sylvania. And you'll find yourself
making rapid headway as the company continues to
add new facilities, new fields.
A stimulating atmosphere of accomplishment and

THE SMALL INDUSTRY
by A. NEIL GUSTINE, President, King-Seeley Corporation
The demand for young engineers has,
with only brief exceptions, been very great
for approximately the last twelve years.
World War II, the intense post-war de-
mand for goods, the Korean struggle, and
the present defense effort have all com-
bined to increase the need for engineers.
While the war-created or war-related de-
mand may lessen somewhat in the future,
the return to more rigorous competitive
conditions will, in my opinion, continue
to create a very strong need for the serv-
ices of young engineers. Companies are
now striving to find new ways to reduce
costs, to improve their products, and to
develop new products, new processes, and
new equipment. For these efforts they re-
quire the services of many well-trained,
capable engineers—men who can help
create a better standard of living for all
of us.
While the efforts made by large firms
to attract young engineers may be more
familiar to you, the need for engineers is
by no means limited to such companies.
All progressive manufacturers need able
engineering personnel, and most busi-
nesses, both large and small, prefer to de-
velop and train their own people. Conse-
quently, there are usually opportunities
for young engineers in companies of all
sizes. Of course, the smaller the organiza-
tion the smaller the size of the engineer-
ing staff and the fewer the number of
openings. In addition, the rate of turn-
over in well-managed small companies is
usually slight, and this fact also limits
the number of openings. On the other
hand, the low rate of turnover attests to
• the advantages of smaller size.
When King-Seeley, for example, is in
the market for an engineer, we proceed
in much the same manner as do larger
organizations. We visit colleges and uni-
versities, advertise in newspapers and in
engineering publications. King-Seeley is
fortunate to be located in Ann Arbor, for
many excellent prospects have been re-
ferred to us by faculty members of the
Engineering College. We are frequently
contacted directly by applicants for engi-
neering positions, and there have been
many instances over the years where we
have given summer employment to engi-
neering undergraduates and have hired
them permanently after their graduation.
Good small firms are usually very selec-
tive in hiring engineers. They look upon
prospective additions to their staffs as per-
manent additions and they attempt to
project an image of the engineer's useful-
ness five or ten years into the future. All
companies seek men of above average
mental mentality. While all want engi-
neers who will be able to work success-
fully with other people, this requirement
is perhaps even more vital for the smaller
companies than the larger ones. Small
size naturally makes for a great many
daily personal contacts not only with
other employees but with customers' rep-
resentatives. Engineers have to be able
"to get along" and to impress customers
favorably.
Now one might logically ask, "Why
should I join a small company? What are
its advantages?" I think the answer to the
question may be found by comparing a
small class in engineering with a large
lecture course. The advantages of the
small class are analogous to those offered
by the small company. The small class
provides a greater opportunity for self-
expression, personal attention, and for
closer relationship with the professor and
the other fellows in the class. And so it is
in industry. In small firms, engineers do
not "get lost." The engineering staff is
usually small enough so that ability is
quickly recognized. The man with real
talent is going to progress. In a small
business, engineers have an opportunity
to develop self-reliance and decision-mak-
ing ability. Guidance and personal assist-
ance are available for the asking, but the
individual has ample opportunity to use
his initiative and creative ability to the
utmost. In small companies the engineer-
ing staff is compact enough so that a man
comes into contact with a wide range of
engineering problems. He gains an under-
standing of the difficulties other engi-
neers are facing. In addition, he has an
opportunity to air his own problems
with others in the group.
The self-development of the engineer
proceeds in still another way. The very
nature of engineering activity in small
organizations brings a man into contact
with many non-engineering activities.
Young men gain an understanding of the
work of other departments, such as sales,
purchasing, production, and many others.
This experience is particularly invaluable
to the man who is interested in manage-
ment as a career. There is no question in
my mind but what small companies pro-
vide the best opportunity to gain an ap-
preciation of the techniques used and the
complexities involved in the management
of a manufacturing business.
It has been my objective in this article
to give my impression of what a small
company looks for in a young engineer
and to stress the advantages of firms of
smaller size. There is no easy way of
which I am aware to locate the individual
opportunties that exist in the many excel-
lently managed small companies through-
out the country. If a man is interested in
an engineering career with a small or-
ganization, he will find splendid possi-
bilities in many sections of the United
States. My advice would be to investigate
several manufacturers in a locality of your
own choosing, contact the man in charge
of engineering, and seek an interview. I
would look for a company that is growing
and whose future prospects appear good.
When you get the job, work hard, try to
make the greatest contribution of which
you are capable, and grow along with the
organization.

Smog is considered public annoyance
No. 1. Air pollution is receiving more
attention than ever before. Residents and
politicians clamor for a pure, clean and
healthful atmosphere. Some cities, to be
sure, have effected very satisfactory con-
trol; others have been much less success-
ful in coping with this problem that fol-
lows rising population and industrializa-
tion.
Among the impurities that cause smog
are organic materials and soot, both
products of incomplete combustion. One
solution may be to remove these materials
from the stack gases before they reach
the atmosphere; another is to burn them,
gaining the heat due to their combustion
as well as removing their obnoxious
qualities.
Soot is produced by the thermal decom-
position of these organics in the absence
of sufficient or turbulent air. Perhaps the
most efficient method of obtaining this
additional air or turbulence or both is
through the use of overfire jets.
Although overfire jets are nothing new
on the industrial scene, it is in the inter-
est of smoke abatement that the use of so
simple yet so effective a device is stressed.
Though the use of overfire jets can give
impressive results for specific furnaces,
these results can only be considered as a
qualitative indication where any other
type of furnace or boiler is concerned.
What the boiler operator or engineer is
most interested in is a "handle" to grasp
his particular problem in a quantitative
way.
Bituminous Coal Research, Inc., the na-
tional research agency of the Bituminous
coal industry has made an extensive study
of such factors as: (1) flow characteris-
tics within furnaces of varying configura-
tions; (2) spacing of jets; and (3) ele-
vation of jets above the fuel bed. Other
problems considered were the type of
firing equipment, the coal burned, and
the load conditions. The result of this in-
vestigation led to the development of two
basic types of jets for both hand- and
stoker-fired furnaces:
(1) the plain steam jet (or nonaspir-
ating) and,
(2) the overfire air jet.
The plain steam jet is used where the
prime need is added turbulence to break
up stratification of the furnace gases and
provide better mixing of existing air with
the volatile organics and soot. The air-
inducing jet is used where there is a need
for both turbulence and overfire air. For
meeting these latter requirements the
blou'er jet and the steam-air jet are avail-
able. With the first type, air is fed to the
furnace through a series of tubes supplied
through a header by a moderate or high-
pressure blower. When steam is the mo-
tive power, steam nozzles are located
ahead of the entrances to the air tubes
to aspirate the air to the furnace.
Although few definite rules can be
made for locating jets, recognition of the
combustion principles of different types
of furnaces provides an indication of
the location where the jets will generally
prove most beneficial. Furthermore, a re-
vealing technique often used prior to final
location is to explore the firebox with a
bare steam nozzle attached to a steam
hose from as many openings in the fire-
box as are available. Careful observation
should be made of the decrease in smoki-
ness above the fuel bed as the jet stream
penetrates and mixes with the gases. Of
course on sectional cast iron and steel fire-
box boilers the jets should be installed
by a competent boiler maker. The fittings
themselves, however, can be made from
typical material available from the boiler
shop.
Fig. 1 shows a sketch of a furnace and
lists the essential features which are neces-
sary to realize the two basic objectives of
overfire jets: (1) introduce the overfire
air and/or turbulence close to the fuel
bed where the organic hydrocarbons are
released and (2) provide full coverage
over the entire fuel bed.
(Fig- 1)
The basic data required for design of
blower jets consists of:

(3) Density of smoke to

(4) Width of grate 8 ft.
(5) Length of grate 10 ft.
Design procedure:
Step 1—blower capacity
(Max. # coal burned per hr.) x (cfm
air per # coal burned per hr) equals
blower capacity in cfm.
Using 13,000 Btu/# and ,"Moderate"
smoke density in Table 1, it is found that
.43 cfm air is required per # coal per hr.
Thus: (2000#/hr.) X (.43 cfm/
# hr) equals 860 cfm total air required.
(Table 1)
Step 2—jet location
Determine:
(1) Length of penetration for jets,
which is just the length of the grate.
(2) Length of wall where jets are to
be located.
Step 3—number of overfire jets
Using the information established in
step 2, determine from Table 2 the recom-
mended number of jets. From the exem-
plary data, aided by Fig. 2 and Table 2,
we find the recommended number of
overfire jets to be seven.
(Table 2)
Step 4—air per jet
Determine cfm of air to be handled by
each air jet as follows:
Total cfm air (from step 1)
No. of jets (from step 3)
cfm air per jet
860 cfm
equals
Thus: — . equals approximately
120 cfm per jet
Step 5—air tube size and blower pres-
sure
Determine, by means of Fg. 3, the
size of air tube and pressure for blower
as follows: Locate length of penetration
(from step 2) on scale "A" of Fig. 3;
proceed vertically upward. Locate cfm air
(from step 4) on scale "B"; proceed
horizontally to the right. Where these
two lines intersect spot point on nearest
size of air tube; proceed vertically to the
same tube size in upper set of curves. At
this point, proceed horizontally to the left
and read air pressure for blower jets on
scale "C." The arrows shown on Fig. 3
follow the example.

Table 2. Number of overfire jets recommended for various lengths of
walls and lengths of jet penetration.
Step 6—duct size
The calculation of the duct size based on
the volume of air from the blower is fair-
ly straight forward.
Step 7—jet evaluation
Experimental determination yielded the
folowing rule:
Locate air tubes a distance equal to one
jet spacing above the normal level of fuel
bed; aim them at a point on opposite wall
at least 6 inches above fuel bed level (see
Fig. 1). In the example being followed,
this gave a value of 12 inches above the
normal level of the fuel bed for jet loca-
tion. All information is now available for
the construction of blower jets.
Design and construction of steam-air
jets including mufflers: Since an unmuffled
steam jet delivering air from the boiler
room is irritating to the attendants, the
steam jet should be equipped with a
muffler or silencer.
In the construction of a steam-air jet,
the location and alignment of the steam
nozzle is extremely important so that
minimum steam will be used for intro-
ducing the overfire air to the furnace.
These relationships are shown in Fig. 7

Professor of Physics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology
Reprinted from Applied Mechanics Reviews, March 1954
This is a progress report on a relatively
new branch of applied science. First uti-
lized during the last war on military
problems, it proved valuable enough so
that most military staffs, here and in Eng-
land, now have operation-research
groups. More recently its usefulness in in-
dustry is coming to be recognized, and
groups are also being attached to top
industrial staffs. The Operations Research
Society of America, formed two years ago,
now has nearly 1000 members; its Jour-
nal is now in its second volume. What is
this new activity, and how is it related to
other branches of science and engineer-
ing?
Defining a branch of science in a few
nontechnical terms is not easy. Perhaps
the safest definition is that Operations
Research is the activity carried on by
operations-research groups and reported
in the Journal of the Operations Research
Society of America. But often some less
circular sort of definition is desirable.
Students who may wish to learn about the
field have to be told what it is; people
want to know what it's good for; workers
in related fields want to know why it
should be differentiated from their own
fields, and so on.
What Is Operations Research?
Operations Research has been defined
as the application of the scientific method
to problems of management, but this is
obviously too concise and too general a
statement. There are many sorts of "scien-
tific methods," and many sorts of people
study problems of management. Part of
the definition must describe the way these
problems are studied. Here the word
"research" in the title may give a hint.
The research scientist, at least in physi-
cal sciences, uses the quantitative language
of mathematics, employs the well-known
but difficult-to-describe procedures of ex-
perimentaiton and theory making. He
looks at the phenomenon he is studying
in a certain impersonal way, being more
interested in how than in whither, more
interested in why than in for what use.
Many centuries of experience have taught
him that this impersonal viewpoint, this
dual employment of theory and experi-
ment, will usually procure for him results
of value in his science and that too great
a preoccupation with questions of the
worth of the result, or the immediacy of
the need, actually will hinder his progress.
Operations Research, then, is the appli-
cation of research techniques to the study
of the operations of war and peace. It is
concerned with an attempt to understand
something, in the scientific sense of the
word "understanding." It is an effort to
discover regularities in some phenomenon
and to link these regularities with other
knowledge so that the phenomenon can
be modified or controlled, just as other
scientific research does. The difference
comes in the phenomenon which are
studied, the subject matter. Instead of
studying the behavior of electrons, or
metals, or gasoline engines, or insects, or
individual men, Operations Research
looks at what goes on when some team of
men and equipment goes about doing its
assigned job. A battalion of soldiers, a
squadron of planes, a factory, or a sales
organization is more than a collection of
men and machines; it is an activity, a
pattern of operation. These operations can
be studied, their regularities can be deter-
mined and related to other regularities;
eventually they can be understood, and
they then can be modified and improved.
Research at the Operational Level
Operations Research is concerned, not
with matter or with individual machines
or with men, but with the operation as a
whole; with battle tactics, with strategic
and logistic planning for future opera-
tions, with the interrelation between sales
fluctuations, size of inventories, and pro-
duction scheduling, with the flow pattern
of goods in a group of factories or of
traffic in a city, to mention a few ex-
amples. We might use the word "level"
to distinguish between the different sub-
ject material, if we can divorce the word
from any connotation of relative impor-
tance or difficulty. Physics and chemistry
would then correspond to research at the
basic or material level, the study of
bridges and television sets, research at the
engineering or applied level. Operations
Research would then be "research at the
operational level."
Although the name is relatively new,
research at the operational level is not
new, of course. Taylor and his followers,
in their time-and-motion studies, have in-
vestigated a small part of the whole field,
traffic engineers have been working on
another part, systems engineers encroach
on it, and so on. Perhaps the most use-
ful service the new term Operations Re-
search has performed is to emphasize the
essential unity of the whole field, to force
the recognition of similarities in behavior
in areas hitherto separate, and to make
apparent the broad usefulness of a num-
ber of research techniques and mathemati-
cal models.
Techniques Used
I have not yet said anything about the
techniques used in Operations Research.
As with other research, any technique of
measuremnt or of calculation, any portion
of a basic science is used which will pro-
duce results. We should expect that the
theory of probability and of statistics
would be very useful tools; we also
should expect that the techniques of the
psychologist would be needed in other
cases. This does not mean that Operations
Research is applied statistics, on the one
hand, or is a branch of social psychology,
on the other. It uses any and all of these
disciplines to study operations in order
that they may be understood and thus
controlled. Since a wide variety of basic
science is involved, much of the research
can best be carried on by a team of work-
ers having a variety of background train-
ing, each contributing his specialized
knowledge to the solution of the opera-
tional problem. The advantage of a mixed
team for the study of many operational
problems is obvious. In fact, some per-
sons have said that the use of mixed re-
search teams is a characteristic of Opera-
tions Rsearch. It certainly is important in
many investigations; whether it is charac-
teristic or necessary might be questioned.
But certainly further generalities will
not be helpful here; a few specific ex-
amples may help clarify the picture. Cer-
tain particular aspects of operations have
been the subject of intensive study in the
last few years, and special mathematical
models have been developed to help
understand the phenomena. As is usual
14
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


the phenomena, and since Operations Re-
search is new, most of these models need
further development before they can be
satisfactorily general in their applicability.
Here the Operations Research worker
needs the help of the basic scientist, par-
ticularly the mathematician.
Waiting in Line
Take the simple business of waiting in
line—the British call it queuing. All of
us do it too much of the time; if we drive
to work in the morning, we wait at traffic
lights; if we go to a cafeteria at noon,
we wait for our lunch. It is the headache
of many businesses; it is a vital problem
for airlines when an airport clouds in and
the planes begin to stack up, waiting to
land. Let us see what can be said about
this sort of problem.
We start as usual with a fantastically
simplified case, one where the front of
the line is served at some constant rate,
say, 5 per second, and where the rear of
the line is being filled up by people (or
planes) coming in at random times but
with an average rate of arrival, A per
second. We also will assume that this has
been going on long enough so that a
steady state has been reached; we can
consider the transient case as a later elab-
oration. The key to this mathematical
model lies in the working out of the
various probabilities that the line will
have 0, 1, 2, or n persons in it. Call the
probability that there are n persons in the
line P„.
If Pw is large, for example, this means
that we are quite likely to find 10 people
ahead of us when arriving in line; what
the restaurant tries to do is to make Pu
large.
To have a steady state none of the P
should change with time.
But every time a person arrives, all the
P step up one by one, P0 changes to Plt
and so on; and every time a person is
served, they all change downward. So, in
order that A persons arriving a second
and 5 being served a second will not
change the probabilities continually, they
must be related in some special way. For
example, the rate of disappearance of a
line of zero length is AP„, the rate of ar-
rival times the chance that a zero-length
line is there; the rate of appearance of
a line of zero length is SPlt the rate of
serving times the chance that a single-
length line is present. To have a constant
probability of zero-length line, we must
have these two rates balance; AP0 =
■SPj. Similar balance for lines of unit
lengths, of length n, and so on, gives
rise to the sequence of equations.
AP0 + SPt = (A + S)P1; AP„_, +
SPntl = (A + S)PH
and so on.
These can be solved without much
trouble, giving P = (S — A) (A"/
5"+1) as long as the rate of serving 5 is
larger than the rate of customer arrival A.
It is obvious that if customers are arriving
at a rate faster than they can be served,
the line cannot ever be stationary in
length and, if they value their reputation
or peace of mind, our restaurant or air-
port managers must avoid this at all costs.
But even when customers arrive more
slowly than they can be served, we see
that there is a finite chance that a line will
form. In fact, the average length of the
line turns out to be A/(S — A).
This quantity is quite small as long as
the maximum serving rate 5 is at least
twice the arrival rate A. But if people
arrive nearly as fast as they can be served,
the average waiting line rapidly length-
ens; if A is 0.85, then the average num-
ber in line is 4; if A is 0.95, the line has
9 in it, on the average, and so on. For
example, if A is 0.85, if customers are
served 2 5 per cent faster than they arrive,
on the average, then 20 per cent of the
time there will be no line, 16 per cent
of the time one will be waiting, 13 per
cent of the time two will be in line, 8
per cent of the time four will be waiting,
2 per cent of the time ten will be in
line, and so on; the average line length
will be four.
It may seem peculiar that there should
be any waiting line when the mean rate
of service is greater than the average rate
of arrival; this is due to our assumption
of randomness in service and arrival. We
assume that each customer doesn't con-
veniently arrive just when the last cus-
tomer has been served; the customers
arrive at random, which does not mean
regularly. Also, one customer may take
longer to be served than the next, and a
bunch of customers every now and then
arrive just when a slowpoke is being
served.
These random mismatches between cus-
tomer and server don't matter much if the
service is considerably faster than the
average rate of arrival; once in a long
time two or three may come in a bunch,
but most of the time no one is waiting.
But if customers arrive nearly as fast as
the line can be handled, these mismatches
occur more and more often, and the
chance of a long line occurring quickly is
large. Of course, if the servicing process
could be made absolutely regular, each
service completed exactly in 10 seconds,
for example, and if also we could regi-
ment our customers to arrive exactly 10
seconds apart, so that one walked in the
door exactly at the end of each 10 sec-
onds, then 5 could equal A, and still no
line would form.
But service is very seldom as perfectly
timed as this, and we practically never can
regiment the arrivals. Customers, automo-
biles, and airplanes do arrive in a random
manner at restaurants, street intersections,
and airports, and it turns out that the re-
sults of our simple quantitative reasoning
fit actuality remarkably well in spite of
our preconceptions to the contrary. Here
is a case where theory and actuality con-
tradict our intuitive "feelings."
In every case where this theory applies,
gross errors of estimate have been made,
regarding the expected length of waiting
lines, on the basis of nonmathematical
"hunches." Often long arguments have
occurred before the manager would be
willing to face the consequences of the
theory. They would continue to say, "But
why should there be a waiting line when
I can serve them faster than they are
coming?" in spite of the line which was
there before their eyes. The results of
such irrational behavior only produce irri-
tation in the case of restaurants, gasoline
stations, and the like; it is much more
serious in the case of airports or docking
facilities in harbors, particularly under
wartime conditions.
Industrial Problems
The simple theory, sketched so quickly
above, can be expanded and complicated
almost indefinitely. For example, the
problem of machine maintenance in a fac-
tory is of this sort. The machine can be
said to "arrive in the waiting line" when
it breaks down; it is "served" when it gets
repaired. The flow of parts through an
assembly line is another example. The
theory can tell us how many parts must
be kept on hand at each stage of the
process, in order that no machine should
be kept idle by delay in the earlier proc-
essing, for example. Many aspects of the
over-all problem of industrial inventories
also can be analyzed by this technique.
Here it is the sales, the outflow, which
has the large fluctuations; we need to
balance between the requirement that
orders be filled as soon as they come in
and the added expense of running a fac-
tory overtime if our inventory runs out.
Another sort of problem which turns

In February of this year the University
placed its new television studio into oper-
ation. The building is located at 310
Maynard Street, next to the new city park-
ing structure and across the street from
the School of Music.
The building itself, which has been re-
modeled by the University Plan Extension
Department, has an interesting history.
It was constructed in the late 19th cen-
tury as a dance hall, known as the
Grainger Dance Academy. In its time, it
was considered to be a very elegant estab-
lishment, and most of the University
formal dances were held there for many
years. The building next was used as a
funeral home from about 1916 until
1952. In the summer of 1952, the Uni-
versity leased the structure, and planning
was immediately started for converting
it into a television studio. Actual remodel-
ing work commenced in June of 1953,
and was completed late in December,
1953.
As originally constructed, the building
had a dance floor approximately 90 feet
by 45 feet. This area has been broken
down into a studio 45 feet by 45 feet,
a scenery workshop, and a control room.
The front portion of the original struc-
ture has provided space for dressing
rooms, offices, a dark room, observation
rooms, and for housing the technical
equipment not housed in the studio con-
trol room.
In converting a building designed 60
years ago into a modern television studio
many problems naturally arose. Television
demands many rather unique building
considerations. A great deal of time and
effort was devoted to fitting these various
requirements into the existing structure.
The architectural design was handled by
the University Plant Service, and their
excellent work is reflected in the very
functional and well integrated studio
building that has resulted.
At this point a brief description of
some of the less obvious physical charac-
teristics of the building may be in order.
Television equipment generates a great
deal of heat, and so air conditioning was

mercial TV stations since one of the primary functions of educational TV is experi-
mentation in all aspects of TV production.
a necessity in the entire production and
technical area. Thirty-five tons of refrig-
eration are used, twenty for the studio
proper, and fifteen for the control areas.
All of the duct work had to be installed
in the original structure without weaken-
ing it, and without taking up too much
valuable space. This problem alone
proved to be rather difficult to solve. The
basement under the front of the building
had to be deepened in order to accom-
modate the ventilating fans. New con-
nections were made to the Ann Arbor
water and storm sewer systems to service
the refrigeration units. It was also deter-
mined that the existing oil burning boiler
did not have sufficient capacity to handle
the extra load imposed by the air con-
ditioning system. It was enlarged, and a
new burner installed.
The entire electrical system in the
building was replaced. Power is now sup-
plied at 120/208 volts, three phase, wye
connected. The load capacity is approxi-
mately 110 kilowatts. The power distribu-
tion system within the building was de-
signed to provide excellent voltage regu-
lation with varying load conditions, since
the load can jump as much as 40 kilo-
watts within a few minutes due to the
heavy power requirements of the studio
lights and the refrigeration system. A
separate circuit, each with its own circuit
breaker, is provided for every major piece
of TV equipment.
Sound isolation of the studio was a par-
ticularly severe problem, because of the
new parking structure on one side, and an
alley frequented by noisy trucks on the
other. Accordingly a "room-within-a-
room" was constructed of one foot cement
blocks to enclose the actual studio area.
The sound isolation thus obtained is very
satisfactory.
The studio is equipped with three
image orthicon cameras, two microphone
booms, several stand and portable
microphones, a large dimmer switchboard
for lighting units. The studio control
room houses the control and switching
equipment for the three studio cameras,
and for an iconoscope film camera. It also
houses an audio console for controlling
the program sound. This is the place

The master control room at present
houses a master 10 ampere electronically
regulated B-plus DC power supply, racks
containing the synchronizing generators,
and the signal distribution and monitoring
equipment.
The film kinescope recording room
houses the projection equipment which
permits the televising of 16 mm motion
picture film, 2x2 slides and i\/4 x 4
opaques and transparencies. In addition,
there is the kinescope recorder. More ac-
curately termed a video recorder, this
machine produces 16 mm sound motion
picture films of television programs by
photographing the image formed on a
special, high brightness picture tube
(kinescope).
Also in the control room area are lo-
cated an announce booth and an elec-
tronic workshop.
In the planning and installation of the
television equipment, it was recognized
that maximum flexibility in equipment
interconnection and useage was a neces-
sary goal. This is particularly true in an
educational television set-up. such as this,
since one of the primary functions of edu-
cational television is experimentation in
all aspects of TV production. Hence, this
installation is more elaborate in many
respects than are many commercial TV
stations; and a number of pieces of equip-
ment were especially constructed or modi-
fied so as to meet our particular situa-
tions.

Dow-Corning Developes New Resins
An enirely new class of vehicles for
protective coatings has been developed
by Dow Corning Corporation. Copolym-
ers of silicone and oil-modified phenolic
resins, they are designed to supplement
conventional phenolic resins for appli-
cations where added resistance to heat,
weathering, chemicals and moisture is
desired.
The first two members of the family to
be introduced, identified as XR-875 and
XR-859, contain 25% and 50% silicone
respectively. Spar varnishes based on XR-
875 show excellent color retention after
1000 hours in the Atlas Sunshine
Weatherometer, while those formulated
with XR-859 not only held their color,
but also retained 90% of their original
gloss. Commercial phenolic varnishes
failed in less than 500 hours.
Identical in appearance and applica-
tion to standard phenolic varnishes, both
silicone-phenolics air dry to a hard film
in 16 hours or less. The water and chemi-
cal resistance of the silicone phenolic films
is better than comparable silicone alkyds.
They can be baked to give excellent film
properties in the 400-500°F range. So-
luble in mineral spirits, they are widely
compatible with alkyd and phenolic
varnishes.
These properties suggest their use in
spar varnishes, maintenance paints and
specialty coatings. Availability is limited
to laboratory quantities at the present
time.
Revitalized Race Horses
A special fodder, containing an anti-
biotic but no stimulants, has apparently
made winners out of nine Australian race
horses, one of which hadn't been able to
win in three years. Despite the joy with
which trainers regard the antibiotic-treat-
ed food, Australian racing experts, Jockey
Club officials and animal nutritionists
were uncertain how to regard it. Never-
theless, it appears to be legal.
Electronic Camera
An electronic camera capable of taking
pictures in one-tenth of one millionth of
one second has been developed by a Cali-
fornia concern. The camera has no mov-
ing parts and uses very little electrical
power.
More V-8 Engines
Five more automobile firms will join
the V-8 engine ranks with 1955 models,
predicts National Petroleum News. One
car manufacturer may change to the V-8
by June or July of this year, while an-
other may shift to a heavier six-cylinder
engine in an effort to boost sales until it
can bring out a V-8, the magazine says.

Filtration Saves Thousands on
Grinding Operations
The maintenance necessary in connec-
tion with varied grinding operations on
parts for signal systems was costing the
General Railway Signal Company a siz-
able sum of money. Cleaning the grinding
machine sumps cost $3800 yearly for
labor, while maintenance of the sump
pumps also required a considerable an-
nual outlay. In addition, Si 152 a year
had to be spent on coolants for the grind-
ing operations, and losses in raw ma-
terials through rejects due to poor finish
were excessive. These conditions finally
made it apparent that coolant filtration
equipment should be installed. After this
was done no labor had to be diverted to
cleaning grinder sumps, coolant costs
were reduced $600 a year, maintenance
on the sump pumps was eliminated, and
rejects were held to a minimum.
The General Railway Signal Company
of Rochester, N.Y., manufactures signal
systems and appliances to protect and
facilitate train operations. All such equip-
ment is designed to "fail safe," which
means that failure of any part of the sys-
tem brings traffic to a halt rather than
allowing it to proceed into possible dan-
ger. Even so, all equipment is designed to
operate with the highest possible degree
of reliability, since unnecessary stopping
of trains would place an added burden
of expense on the railroads in fuel con-
sumed, man-hours wasted, and passengers
and freight delayed.
Much of this equipment must operate
automatically, day and night, under all
sorts of weather conditions. The reliabil-
ity of the equipment is assured by care-
ful manufacturing methods. Standards of
production are maintained on a high
level. Parts making up the numerous as-
semblies and units must fit accurately.
Therefore, precision machining of many
of the parts is specified by the engineers
to insure perfect functioning of the equip-
ment.
Before a continuous filtration system
was installed the oil used as a coolant in
the grinding operations became highly
contaminated in a short time. The con-
tinued use of this oil over a period of a
week caused the contaminating metal par-
ticles to become imbedded in the surface
of the grinding wheel which impaired
product finish and necessitated frequent
wheel dressings. Not only was produc-
tion slowed, but all individual grinder
sumps had to be cleaned each week and
2000 gallons of oil discarded.
After a thorough study of known
methods and equipment available for
coolant purification, management decided
to install a central filtration system for
coolant restoration. A Hoffman Flotation
Clarifier was chosen as the oil filtration
unit and around this the central system
was designed.
When the system was set up the bene-
fits of filtration became evident imme-
diately. Clean oil was delivered to the
grinders continuously and wheel dress-
ings were reduced 50%, thereby doubling
grinding wheel life. The coolant was no
longer discarded each week. Oil replace-
ment took place only once in eight
months reducing coolant cost to $600
a year. With filtration, machine sumps
no longer had to be cleaned at all,
saving $3800 annually. Another impor-
tant benefit was that with clean oil being
delivered constantly there were no more-
metal particles to interfere with grinding
operations or to impair the product finish.
The result of all these other improve-
ments was that rejects were reduced to a
minimum, saving thousands of dollars
yearly. Finally, with the filtration system
it was no longer necessary to furnish
maintenance for the 19 individual grinder
sump pumps since they were discon-
tinued.
The equipment used in these grinding
operations consists of Heald Internal
Grinders, Thompson Grinders, Landis
External Grinders, Norton External
Grinders, Majestic Internal Grinders,
Gallmeyer-Livingston Grinders, Blanch-
ard Surface Grinders, and Cincinnati Cen-
terless Grinders. The oil clarification unit
of this fully automatic filtration system
is a Hoffman model 56 Flotation Unit
with a flow rate of 300 gallons per min-
ute. Other equipment consists of necessary
motor pumps, overhead clean coolant sup-
ply lines to the grinders, and floor
trenches for gravity drainage of dirty
coolant to the self-cleaning sump tank
located beneath the floor.
The filtration cycle begins as the dirty
oil leaves the grinders and flows down
the drainage trench to the dirty coolant
sump tank which is constructed with a
baffle in the rear to maintain constant
agitation. This is done by the force of the
oil flow and is necessary to prevent set-
tlement of particles. Next the oil is trans-
ferred by two motor pumps from the sub-
floor sump tank to the Hoffman flotation
unit. A spare pump, located in the sump
tank, acts as a standby and is operated by

possible overflow. If the dirty coolant
rises too far the float trips the extra pump
switch and the excess oil is pumped out.
In reverse, if the coolant level drops too
far for proper operation the float trips
another switch and the pumps are stopped
until the desired operating level is re-
stored. In the Hoffman unit there is an-
other tank for settlement of the heavier
contaminant particles before the coolant
is pumped into the flotation cell. In the
flotation cell a rotor-stator assembly pro-
duces a dispersion of bubbles which en-
trains the insolubles. This froth is re-
moved by a pair of skimmers driven by a
separate motor through a speed reducing
unit and dropped back into the dirty cool-
ant section where a spray assists in the
settling out process. An automatic drag
chain conveyor, mounted with a series of
scraper flights and driven at slow speeds
to permit maximum oil drainage, drags
the sludge up an incline and dumps it
in a removal cart. Clean oil flows at all
times from the flotation cell into the
clean oil section of the tank where it is
pumped out through overhead pipelines
to the grinders, clarified and ready for
re-use.
Nearly all industrial fluids—oils for
coolants, grinding and cutting, running-
in, honing and lapping, circuit breakers
and transformers, diesel and fuel oils,
and rolling mills, parts washing solvents
and industrial waters—can be restored
again and again. The savings realized
through filtration usually pay for the
needed equipment in a short time.
A number of mechanical principles,
either individually or in combination,
are employed to remove the various im-
purities, chips, turnings, rust, dust, dirt,
lint, abrasive grits, water entrained air,
carbon and fuel dilutions or oil oxidation
products such as resins, gums, organic
acids, and asphaltenes.
Removal methods include flotation,
gravity settling, filtering through various
types of materials, vaporization, vacuum
distillation, pressure filtration and mag-
netic separation. U.S. Hoffman equipment
utilizing these principles has been de-
signed in a complete range of models to
serve the many specific needs of industry.
This apparatus may consist of a single
compact unit attached to an individual
machine, a mobile unit which moves from
one machine to another, or a large cen-
tral filtration plant handling fluids for
an entire department.
The main advantages of filtration are
the conservation of the liquids them-

selves, and the reduction of downtime for
production machinery. Other benefits are
increased tool life, less tool loading, fewer
rejects, better quality work, cleaner fac-
tory conditions, and a reduction in ship-
ping, storage and disposal.
Kodak Announces New
Film Emulsion
A remarkable new high speed profes-
sional sheet film—Kodak Royal Pan—was
announced by the Eastman Kodak com-
pany.
The new film is twice as fast as prev-
ious films of this type. The increase in
emulsion speed has been achieved, how-
ever, without any increase in film graini-
ness.
The development, company officials in-
dicated, represents a significant gain in
film emulsion technology, since until the
introduction of this film emulsion tech-
nologists have been limited in their abil-
ity to achieve increases in film speed
without accompanying increases in granu-
larity.
The new film is expected to prove of
tremendous value to press, commercial
portrait, illustrative, and industrial
photographers since it will permit photog-
raphers to make pictures which have here-
tofore been almost impossible.
The new film has an A.S.A. exposure-
index of 200 for daylight. The tungsten
index is 160.
In addition to its speed Kodak Royal
Pan has been designed to give improved
shadow tone contrast or crispness. At the
same time the company has been able to
incorporate factors in the emulsion which
reduce the tendency of highlights to
"block up," as is often the case where
overexposure or overdevelopment occur.
This reduced blocking characteristic is
expected to be of particuar help to
photographers when the lighting range
cannot be carefully controlled, since the
resulting negatives can be printed with
less shading and dodging. In such in-
stances the greater transparency of the
highlight areas also will be helpful in
the production of better quality prints
from difficult subjects.
By design the new film will tolerate a
very wide range of both over and under-

which will make satisfactory prints. To
further complement the exposure latitude,
the company has also increased the de-
velopment latitude so that the contrast
of the negative will not change as rapidly
with small amounts of overdevelopment.
For example, a series of negatives ex-
posed the same time and developed for
4, 5, and 6 minutes might very easily
produce equally acceptable prints on the
same grade of paper. Even a negative
developed as much as 8 minutes requires
only one grade softer paper.
The increased speed of the film will in
many instances permit pictures to be
made with pres type cameras which here-
tofore could only be made with reflex or
miniature cameras having faster lenses.
Pictures can also be made under condi-
tions which would previously have been
impossible for picture taking with pro-
fessional sheet film cameras. On the other
hand, the new film offers tremendous op-
portunities for improving the general run
of photography because the lens stop can
now be set one full stop smaller leading
to increased depth of field or range of
sharpness, or the shutter speed can be
doubled to better stop subject movment.
Still other benefits offered by the new
film is improved speed relate to its ef-
fectiveness with various types of lighting
equipment.
The possibilities for the effective and
convenient use of very small flash lamps
—such as the No. 8's—are, for example,
definitely improved. The faster film also
makes portable speedlights the equivalent
of being twice as bright, or, looking at it
from another way, it opens possibilities
for the building of even smaller, lighter
weight units.
In addition this faster film also permits

more and better picures to be made of
night sporting events. In trade tests it has
extended the picture-taking possibilities
in color photography when it has been
used in one-shot cameras.
Machining Complex Metals with
Ultrasonic Machine Tools
Machining operations on brittle or ex-
tremely hard materials that are difficult
and even border on the impossible, can
now be performed with a high speed,
high precision ultrasonic machine tool,
designed and manufactured by the Shef-
field Corporation, Dayton 1, Ohio. Using
ultrasonic vibrations in combination with
abrasive particles in suspension the Shef-
field Cavitron machine tool can produce-
through holes, blind holes, and contoured
cavities in ceramics, glass, and precious
stones, as well as in carbides and other
fused and sintered materials or any metal
or alloy. Low cost, soft steel cutting oils
are used to duplicate the most exacting
contours.
Extensive use of complex feretic metals
in the electronics field has created many
problems which, due to the extreme brit-
tleness of some of these materials, cannot
be solved with ordinary machining
methods. Using the ultrasonic machining
technique it is possible to drill, slice,
carve or cut off such metals or materials
to various shapes or sizes.
Sectors of materials used as separators
in an electrical conduit have been ma-
chined with a penetration rate of 1/g inch
per minute. The operation has given con-
sistent results which are remarkable in
view of the properties of this material.
A high degree of precision, elimination
of chipping of the work material, and
fine surface finish are some of the ad-
vantages which this ultrasonic machine
tool offers. The accompanying photograph
shows typical parts and operations which
have been machined with this method.
The dimensional accuracy in both size
and location has been held to plus or
minus .001 inch on these jobs.
New Jersey Zinc Announces
New Method of Roasting Zinc Ores
Another major advance in processing
zinc concentrates to metal was recorded
recently by Company metallurgists in

roasting of zinc sulfide ores. The process,
which has been patented, eliminates cost-
ly grinding and sintering of such ores for

method keeps impurities
down to less than
5 parts in a billion
In this refining apparatus, at Western Electric1*
AUentown, Pa. plant, germanium is passing through
multiple heating zones in tandem, producing a bar containing
impurities of less than 5 parts in a billion for use in transistors.
Note heating coils on the horizontal quartz tube.
A new method of metal refining, currently in use at the
Western Electric plant at AUentown, results in the pro-
duction of germanium that is better than 99.99999957c
pure — the highest degree of purity ever attained in a
manufactured product.
The need for germanium of such exceptional purity
came about when research by Bell Telephone Labora-
tories in the field of semi-conductors led to the develop-
ment of transistors, which are manufactured by Western
Electric.
The transistor is a tiny crystal device which can amplify
and oscillate. It reduces space requirements and power
consumption to a minimum.
Various forms which germanium takes before being used in tran-
sistors are shown in this photo. Bar at top is an ingot of ger-
manium after reduction from germanium dioxide. Next is shown
the germanium ingot after the zone refining process used by
Western Electric. Below the ingots arc shown 3 germanium crys-
tals grown by machine, 6 slices cut from these crystals, and several
hundred germanium wafers ready for assembly into transistors.
Germanium crystals of the size required in transistors
do not occur in nature; they are artificially grown at
Western Electric. At this stage in transistor manufac-
ture, other elements are introduced in microscopic quan-
tities to aid in controlling the flow of electrons through
the germanium. But before these elements can be intro-
duced, it is necessary to start with germanium of excep-
tional purity, so that the impurities will not interfere
with the elements that are deliberately added.
So Bell Telephone Laboratories devised an entirely new
method of purification, known as zone refining, which
was developed to a high-production stage by Western
Electric engineers.
In zone refining a bar of germanium is passed through
a heat zone so that a molten section traverses the length
of the bar carrying the impurities with it and leaving
behind a solidified section of higher purity. By the use
of multiple heating zones in tandem, a number of molten
sections traverse the bar. Each reduces the impurity
content thus producing a bar which contains impurities
in the amount of less than five parts per billion.
Because of the importance of the transistor in elec-
tronics, the zone refining process — like so many other
Western Electric developments — has been made avail-
able to companies licensed by Western Electric to man-
ufacture transistors.
This is one more example of creative engineering by
Western Electric men. Engineers of all skills — mechan-
ical, electrical, chemical, industrial, metallurgical, and
civil — are needed to help us show the way in funda-
mental manufacturing techniques.

moving parts and of simple construction.
It has the further advantage of being able
to handle successfully zinc sulfide concen-
trates from many sources. Other applica-
tions of the process show promise.
The primary function of the fluid col-
umn roaster, of course, is to remove sul-
fur from the ore, because zinc metal or
zinc oxide cannot be made from ore that
contains sulfur. Furthermore, the sulfur,
which is removed as sulfur dioxide, is a
valuable raw material for making sulfuric
acid. The new roaster not only performs
this basic step in the zinc smelting proc-
ess, but at the same time changes the
physical properties of the concentrate to
yield a more easily reduced charge for the
smelting furnaces and one that makes for
better zinc recovery.
When the fluid column roasting process
for zinc sulfide concentrates is compared
with kiln- or flash-roasting followed by
sintering, several advantages are apparent.
The step of fine grinding is not necessary
for the fluid column charge and the need
for a separate sintering step is eliminated.
Preparation of the charge by flaking or
pelleting is necessary before fluid column
roasting, but this also is necessary before
the sintering step which must follow
other roasting methods. Because the ore
passes through the column as hard pel-
lets, dust losses are very low.
An experimental unit of full commer-
cial size was operated at Palmerton
throughout 1953.
New Advance in Hardness Testing
Most of the known standard hardness
testing methods are unsuitable for small
or highly finished parts since impressions
caused by the diamond or steel points
usually ruin the part, resulting in consid-
erable losses and scrap. Many attempts
have therefore been made to produce a
reliable hardness testing instrument, mak-
ing only the most minute scratches or im-
pressions which cannot be seen with the
naked eye and are so small that even the
finest finish is not marred by the test.
Such an instrument has recently been
perfected and is placed on the market by
the George Scherr Co., Inc., of New
York 12, N.Y.
It is a portable bench type instrument
shown in the illustration which is an in-
genious and exclusive design combining
a positive controlled diamond penetrat-
ing action with a high power microscope

of 400 magnifications. The microscope is
swung directly over the impression to read
the hardness by measuring with a reticule
scale and vernier in .0005 millimeter re-
sulting in hardness readings of unusual
precision in half a micron (.0005 milli-
meter) .
Micro-hardness tester barely scratches
surface.
Instructions and tables are furnished
with the instrument converting readings
into Rockwell and other standard hard-
ness scales in use.
Also coarse impressions such as Brin-
nel ball test may be measured for which
purpose a coordinate measuring stage is
provided such as found on toolmakers
microscopes, thus making the tool more
useful for general optical measuring of
any kind, occurring in shop or laboratory.
Inert Atmosphere Chamber
A versatile inert atmosphere chamber
with an associated purifying system has
been constructed at the National Bureau
of Standards, where it is proving very
useful in the Bureau's program of re-
search in electrodeposition. The chamber,
which was designed by Abner Brenner
and J. M. Sherfey of the NBS staff, per-
mits all the common chemical manipu-
lations such as filtration, distillation,
transfer, and weighing to be carried out
without contamination of reactants or
products with oxygen, water vapor, or
carbon dioxide.
As a result of the current widespread
interest in a variety of atmosphere-sensi-
tive chemicals, such as hydrides, moro-
hydrides, and metal-organic compounds,
there has been a growing need for a de-
vice that will permit the chemical manip-
ulation of these materials without resort
to elaborate and time-consuming sealed
systems often applicable to only one oper-
ation. Experience with the NBS inert at-
mosphere chamber over the past two years
indicates that it should meet the require-
ments of most groups that are working
with atmosphere-sensitive chemicals on a
laboratory scale.
The entire apparatus consists of two
principal parts: the air-free chamber, or
"dry box," and the purification train. The
whole is a closed system, that is, the inert
gas passes continuously from the box
through the purifying system and back
to the box. An antechamber, with an ex-
tension for use with longer pieces of ap-
paratus, permits the introduction of ap-
paratus without contamination of the in-
ert atmosphere within the box. Manipula-
tions are performed through four alum-
inum ports to which are cemented should-
er-length rubber gloves. When not in
use, the glove ports can be closed off
with metal caps so that gradual diffusion
through the rubber of the gloves is pre-
vented. An inverted cylindrical Pyrex jar
(12 inches O.D. and 24 inches high)
sealed in place over a hole in the top of
the box permits the use of tall apparatus
such as a reflux condenser.
A pump, enclosed in a gas-tight cylin-
der, circulates the inert gas in sequence
through an apparatus for the removal of
oxygen (in parallel with a by-pass), a
heat exchanger to remove heat of com-
pression, two activated alumina dryers in
parallel for removal of water vapor, the
dry box and its antechamber, and a trap
for the removal of acidic gases which
might harm the pump or other parts of
the system. The gas then returns to the
pump to complete the cycle. The acid
trap, containing coarsely granular soda
lime, also eliminates carbon dioxide from
the atmosphere of the box. Oxygen is re-
moved from the system by passing the gas
over copper at 550°C in a specially de-
signed apparatus. Continuous regeneration
of the copper is achieved by periodically
adding hydrogen to the atmosphere of
the dry box.
The box proper is essentially a welded
aluminum frame, 34 inches high, 12
inches wide, and 24 inches deep, with
plate-glass front, back, and left end. The
vertical edges are aluminum angle, and

sheet. One end of the box is of plate
glass while the other, to which the ante-
chamber is attached, is of 14-inch alum-
inum.
The antechamber and its extension are
aluminum cylinders having 15-inch inner
diameters and walls l^-inch thick. The
antechamber has a length of 20 inches,
which may be increased to 44 inches by
attaching the extension with hinged bolts.
The inner and outer doors of the ante-
chamber and the door of the antechamber
extension close by means of screw-clamp
devices which seal the doors against neo-
prene "0"-ring gaskets recessed into
grooves in the rims of the openings.
Because the dry box would be ruptured
by small changes in pressure above or
below atmospheric, it is equipped with a
combination oil manometer and pressure-
relief device which prevents pressure dif-
ferences greater than 0.5 lb/in.2 A small
closed-end mercury manometer has also
been installed to indicate the degree
of evacuation of the antechamber. Both
of these manometers are sealed in by
means of packing glands screwed into
aluminum couplings which are welded in
place. The interior of the box is provided
with electrical .outlets and valved hose
connections through which water, pres-
sure, and vacuum lines can be brought in.
A flow of about 20 cu. ft. of gas per
minute through the system has been
found adequate and. does not require ex-
cessively large equipment. A gage pres-
sure of about 3 lb/in2 is necessary to
maintain this flow if argon is used as an
atmosphere. About half this pressure is
required if helium is being circulated.
The dry box proper is filled with the
inert gas by the aid of a very large bal-
loon such as is used in meterological
work. The balloon is placed within the
box and is inflated with air through one
of the valved hose connections until it
essentially fills the chamber. The inert gas
is passed into the space outside of the
balloon through one of the other hose
connections, thus deflating the balloon.
Simultaneously the antechamber and
pump-motor container are evacuated and
filled with the inert gas. After the rest
of the system has been flushed, the purifi-
cation train can be started.
When apparatus is to be put into the
box, the outer door of the antechamber
is opened, and the apparatus, supported
in a specially constructed wire basket, is

placed in the antechamber. The outer
door is then closed, and the antechamber
is evacuated. The inert gas is let into the
antechamber until atmospheric pressure is
obtained, after which the inner door can
be opened and the apparatus can be trans-
ferred to the box, working through the
gloves. Volatile materials to be taken into
the box are kept in a bomb if the evacua-
tion method is used. Otherwise the ante-
chamber is flushed by passing a quantity
of the inert gas through it from a supply
cylinder. After a suitable period this gas
flow can be stopped, and a portion of the
flow from the purification train can be
directed through the antechamber, effect-
ing a final clean-up before the inner door
of the antechamber is opened.
Within a period of eight hours or less,
the system can be filled with inert gas,
and the enclosed atmosphere can be vir-
tually freed of oxygen and water vapor.
Spilled droplets of liquid sodium-potas-
sium eutectic retain a bright surface after
several hours exposure to this atmosphere.
While a quantitative estimation of the
water vapor in the box has not been
made, the oxygen content has been found
to be less than 0.1 percent and the indi-
cations are that it is much lower. The ex-
treme dryness of the box is indicated by
the fact that no fumes can be seen when a
bottle of titanium tetrachloride is opened
inside the box.

ical operations, by Joseph M. Sherfey, Ind.

Hafnium Carbide—Its Properties
As A Refractory
New data on the properties of hafnium
carbide have been provided by recent
work conducted by the Ceramics Depart-
ment of Oak Ridge National laboratory,
Oak Ridge,Tennessee, operated by Union
Carbide for the Atomic Energy Commis-
sion. Literature references indicate that
hafnium carbide is a super-refractory
compound, and is among the hardest ma-
terials known; not a great deal of in-
formation is available, however, because
of the comparative scarcity of pure haf-
nium, since its similarity to zirconium
ordinarily makes the separation of these
two elements difficult. Recent processes
developed at Oak Ridge National Labora-
tory have stepped up the production of
pure zirconium and haifnium. Hafnium
carbide tested at ORNL for use as a re-
fractory material was synthesized from
carbon and pure hafnium oxide available
at the Laboratory.
Pellets of dry-pressed carbon and haf-
nium oxide were heated in a graphite
crucible from 2000 to 2400 degrees Cen-
tigrade over a two-hour period, with a
five-minute period at over 3000 degrees
to volatilize any impurities and to increase
the crystal size by recrystallization. The
product was a loosely coherent mass of
blue-black crystals.
X-ray diffraction showed the cell struc-
ture of hafnium carbide to be of the
cubic type, similar to sodium chloride.
The cube edge has been calcuated to be
4.635 A, and the density, calculated from
the X-ray data, is 12.52. Micro-hardness,
measured with a Vickers indenter under a
50-gram load, gave V,,„ values ranging
from 2533 to 3202, averaging 2913- On
this same scale, diamond has a hardness
of 8400 and boron carbide about 2400;
hafnium carbide appears to compare very
favorably with carbides in use in industry
today.
These studies were made by a group
led by L. M. Doney of the Ceramics De-
partment, which is a part of the Oak
Ridge National Laboratory's Metallurgy
Division. The Laboratory, operated for
the Atomic Energy Commission by Union
Carbide and Carbon Corporation, is a
leader in the field of nuclear reactor de-
velopment and technology, and is the ma-
jor producer of radioactive isotopes for
research and development programs in
medicine, agriculture, industry, and other
fields. The ORNL Ceramics Department
is the largest ceramics group under AEC
direction, and plays an important role in
the application of ceramics to reactor re-
quirements.
Hafnium carbide is still in the labora-
tory stage, but it has become of interest
in recent years for possible application in
high-temperature equipment, and for cut-
ting tools and grinding media. The grow-
ing availability of hafnium will probably
make hafnium carbide of increasing im-
portance for applications where a material
of high hardness is required, although
present indications do not recommend it
for high-impact requirements. Finely-
powdered hafnium carbide can be hot-
pressed into desired shapes in graphite
dies at pressures on the order of 1500
pounds per square inch and temperatures
in the vicinity of 2000 degrees Centi-
grade.

Metal Comparator
A fast, accurate non-destructive instru-
ment for sorting mixed metal parts with
varying alloy content was revealed recent-
ly by General Motors Research Labora-
tories.
Known as the Thermoelectric Metal
Comparator, the instrument is a portable
device, easy to operate in any surround-
ings and usable wherever troubleshoot-
ing is necessary to distinguish one part
from another with composition the only
distinguishable feature.
The comparator also can detect chills in
castings, which cause hardness differences.
At the same time, favorable results have
been obtained by using it to measure
thickness of paint films and metallic
plating. Further investigation is under
way.
Supplants Other Tests
Simply by touching the instrument's
probe to a metal part, a person using the
comparator can get an instant reading on
IN THE NEWS
(Continued from page 24)
a dial that compares the part's composi-
tion with composition of another part.
Both chemical and spectrographic an-
alysis, are to some extent destructive
tests. Also, they require highly skilled
technicians and are relatively time con-
suming. The comparator, on the other
hand, can be used on the spot by an
operator with no special skills.
Moreover, the new instrument's read-
ings are more closely correlated with the
composition of the material under test
than results of magnetic testing.
It is not a cure-all, however, but thus
far, it has adapted itself to most pro-
duction problems assigned to it in Gen-
eral Motors.
Works Like Thermocouple
The GM comparator uses the principle
of a thermocouple, but in an unusual
way. An ordinary thermocouple is a loop
of two different materials. When one of
the junctions of the metals is hot and the
other cold, a small electric current flows
through the loop.
Courtesy General Motors
Eugene A. Hanysi of General Motors Research Laboratories simply by touching a
pair of automatic valves with a hand probe, demonstrates the Thermoelectric Metal
Comparator developed by GM Research Physics and Instrumentation Department.
The instrument can be used for quick, non-destructive sorting of steel for stock or
metal parts where varying chemical composition or alloy content are the only
distinguishable feature.
For example, if copper and iron wires
are twisted together to make a closed cir-
cuit and one of the junctions is heated,
an electric current flows through the cir-
cuit. Voltage generated depends on tem-
perature differences between the junc-
tions of the dissimilar wires.
Thus, thermocouples are used as lab-
oratory thermometers because they meas-
ure wide temperature ranges very accur-
ately, from low temperatures to the melt-
ing points of iron and copper wire, for
instance.
The GM Research comparator's circuit
also is a loop of two different metals, but
the part being tested (clutch lever, valve,
steel bar, etc.) forms part of the loop or
circuit. The instrument's two probe tips
are the hot and cold junctions where they
touch the metal under test.
Voltage Change Amplified
Since temperatures of the two junctions
are kept constant, the change is metallic
composition of the part under test results
in a voltage change that can be read on
the instrument's meter.
Because the small difference in tem-
perature between the two tips results in a
small voltage, an amplifier is included in
the circuit to make possible use of a
quick response-time indicator to increase
sensitivity.
Thus, the comparator can be adapted to
most problems by selecting the right set
of probe tips. Several sets of tips are
available in different alloys of steel and
other metals.
The usual method of choosing a set of
tips is simply to try the sets and pick out
the one that gives the best separation
readings for sorting metals. For a par-
ticularly difficult separation of mixed
parts, it is possible to make a special set
of tips for the comparator.
The instrument is now being tested for
measuring thickness of metallic plating or
paint films, comparing the surface layer
with a similar layer of known thickness.
In this application it operates as an ordin-
ary thermocouple, detecting temperature
changes at the hot junction.
When measuring thickness of electri-
cally non-conducting films, such as paints
on metals, a thin sheet of copper and
aluminum foil placed over the paint film
completes the electrical circuit between
the comparator's two probe tips.

describe the item in a clear and concise

Helping the ™stars" to shine
A tiny off-stage "sun" brings you brighter and better movies
As you see the Hollywood "stars" on the screen of the
darkened theater—perhaps in 3-D—you can thank a
man-made miracle of light—the carbon arc.
This brilliant light comes from tiny carbons not
much larger than pencils. Yet their light is brighter
than the sun itself—enlarging the tiny pictures on the
film as much as 300,000 times!
THEY GIVE YOU THE RAINBOW—Besides the bril-
liance that brings you clear, sharp moving pictures,
these carbons have a light quality almost exactly like
that of the sun. This makes possible the production
and showing of pictures with all colors of the rainbow.
LIGHT YOU DON'T SEE—The rays from these carbons
go beyond the movies into places most of us never see.
They reveal quickly how long a new paint will last, and
whether colors will fade from new fabrics. They also
tell scientists the exact chemical composition of many
materials.
BETTER AND BETTER—Making and constantly im-
proving hundreds of carbon and graphite products for
industry and science is one of the many ways in which
the people of Union Carbide help serve all of us.

up in a large number of operational
studies has to do with the optimization
of some function of a number of vari-
ables, subject to boundary conditions
which limit the range of the variables.
For example, an oil company can pro-
duce various proportions of fuel oil, gaso-
line, and aviation fuel from its cracking
plants, depending on the kind of crude-
oil used, and can produce various propor-
tions of these end products from a given
crude, depending on the cracking proc-
ess used. But crudes differ in price, and
cracking processes differ in cost. Suppose
the company has orders for definite quan-
tities of end products to be delivered in
the next 3 months. What amounts of
which crude shall it buy, and which proc-
esses shall it use in its cracking plants, to
produce the required amounts of products
at the least cost, subject to limitations of
supply of crudes and of output of its
plants?
The variables here are the various
amounts of crudes to be bought and the
degree of utilization of each plant. The
function to be minimized is a linear func-
tion of these variables, and the limits on
each variable are known accurately. Such
a problem is known as a "linear program-
ming" problem. There are many such
problems which turn up in Operation Re-
search. Techniques of solution are not
simple, and many of them require high-
speed computing machines; much further
mathematical research is needed to sim-
plify computing procedures in linear-
programming calculations.
Parenthetically, the optimization of the
crude-oil-cracking problem has been
worked out by the research or the engi-
neering departments of many large oil
companies. The persons who worked out
those solutions did not call what they
were doing Operations Research; many
of them had not heard of Operations Re-
search. It is also true, however, that most
of these workers were not aware that
many other problems in the company's
operations were likewise amenable to the
same analysis. The value of the concept
of Operations Research to these com-
panies lies in making their research men
aware that the techniques of theoretical
analysis they have been using for one
problem can be applied to a much wider
range of operational problems than they
hitherto had conceived, and rn showing
the company executives that they can use
their own research departments to help
(Continued from page li)
solve production and sales and distribu-
tion problems, where formerly they had
not been used. .
Linear Programming
The linear-programming problem can
be visualized most simply in geometrical
terms. The ;; variables define an //-dimen-
sional space; a point of this space corre-
sponds to a solution. Each limitation on
the range of the variables corresponds to
a hyperplane in this space, restricting the
allowed solution points to one side of the
hyperplane. By the time we have finished
specifying all the restrictions (negative
production not allowed, maximum limits
on storage capacity, limits on production,
and so on) we find that we have sur-
rounded the region of possible solution
by hypersurfaces, so that the allowed
region in the interior of a convex poly-
hedron in the hyperspace. If the function
to be optimized is a linear function of the
variable, then the requirement that this
function have some constant value also
corresponds to a hyperplane which may
or may not cut through the polyhedron;
if it does, it then corresponds to an opera-
tionally possible value of the function to
be optimized. By changing the value of
the contant, we can generate a family of
hyperplanes parallel to each other, their
distance from the origin being propor-
tional to the value of the function to be
optimized.
Some of the hyperplanes in this family
cut through the polyhedron containing
the region of solution; some do not.
There are two limiting hyperplanes, one
corresponding to the largest value of the
function for which the hyperplane just
touches the polyhedron, and one corre-
sponding to the smallest value which just
touches. Consideration of the geometry
shows that for most orientations of the
family of planes the two limiting planes
just touch a vertex of the bounding
polyhedron and thus contain just one
possible solution compatible with all the
boundary conditions. The outermost limit-
ing point is the optimum solution if the
function is to be maximized; the inner-
most point is optimum if the function is
to be minimized. Once the geometry is
clear in one's mind, it is easy to visualize
the solution. But, at present, it is not easy
actually to compute the optimum vertex
when there are several dozen variables
and about a hundred boundary faces of
the polyhedron.
Production Planning Needed
Important as linear-programming tech-
niques are, they need further generaliza-
tion to be able to solve many problems in
Operations Research. Production planning
is an example. A factory can produce so
many units of some product each month,
but sales of the product are small during
the summer and very large in December,
so large that fall production cannot equal
December sales. One solution is to run
the factory overtime during the fall; but
overtime production costs more than nor-
mal output. Another solution is to pro-
duce more during spring and summer
and store it ready for the winter rush;
but warehousing also costs money, in
storage and handling charges and in in-
terest on the money tied up. A third solu-
tion of course is to fail to meet orders in
December, but this is a counsel of despair.
It should be evident by now that this is
also a linear-programming problem. The
variables are the regular production each
month and the overtime production each
month. The excess of production over
sales each month is warehoused. The
boundary conditions are the limits on the
production and overtime production each
month and the additional requirements
that the total production from the first of
the year shall never be less than total
sales from the first of the year. The quan-
tity to be minimized is the total cost, in-
cluding overtime charges and warehousing
charges.
As stated, this is a straightforward
linear programming problem, // we can
predict exactly our sales throughout the
coming year. If our sales forecast is exact,
we can proceed to find the distribution
of production and overtime production
each month to minimize total costs and to
satisfy all forecast sales. The trouble is we
never know exactly what the sales are
going to be, and if we have underesti-
mated them, we will not be able to meet
orders; if we have overestimated them,
we will end the year with unsold product
in our warehouse. All we really have is a
probability distribution of expected sales;
to put it pictorially, some of the sides of
the bounding polygon are fuzzy, not
sharp.
Problems of "Bounded Optimization"
At present, our techniques of solution
are not adequate for such problems, nor
are they if the function to be optimized

is not a linear function of the variables. Such more general
problems might be called problems of bounded optimization.
The problems are clear, but a great deal of further analysis and
devising of computational techniques is needed before solu-
tions can be obtained with the requisite ease. Speed of solution
is needed here, for in many cases we wish to find a whole
sequence of solutions as we vary some of the limits: What
happens if we build another factory, or if we close down our
factory in August, for example? When solutions of problems
of bounded optimization are easy to obtain, many tough
problems of planning, of production, of sales effort, of logistic,
and so on, will be easier to solve.
Another kind of problem for which a mathematical model
can be built came up first in naval operatons research but has
numerous analogs. It concerns the operations of "search" for
an enemy vessel, or submarine, or aircraft. The enemy is
somewhere in a given area of the sea. How do you deploy
your aircraft to find him? The central idea here is the "rate of
search." A single plane can see the enemy vessel (by radar or
sonar or visually as the case may be) R miles away, on the
average. The plane can "sweep" out a band of width 2R as it
moves along; the picture is analogous to a vacuum cleaner, of
width 2R. sweeping over the ocean at a rate equal to the speed
of the plane and picking up whatever comes beneath it. An
area equal to the speed of the plane times twice the mean
range of detection will thus be swept in an hour. The sweep
rates of planes vary from a few hundred square miles per
hour to several thousand square miles per hour, depending on
the plane, the radar equipment, and the vessel searched for.
If the enemy is equally likely to be anywhere within certain
area, then the problem is a straightforward geometrical one.
The search effort is evenly laid out over as much of the area
as one his planes available. The problem is a little compli-
cated by the fact that detection is not certain at extreme-
ranges, so the probability of detection falls off near the edge
of the sweep band and bands to improve the chance of detec-
tion near the edges.
But if the chance that the enemy is present varies from
area to area, the problem becomes quite difficult; non-mathe-
matical intuition may lead to quite erroneous use of available
effort. For example, if the enemy is twice as likely to be in one-
area than in another, then, if only a small amount of search
effort is possible, all this effort should be spent in searching the
more likly area. If more effort is available, some time can be
spent on the less likely area, and so on. A definite formula can
be worked out in each specific case. Search plans for various
contingencies were worked out by the Operations Research
team attached to the Navy during the war; they materially
aided the naval efforts in many cases.
From War Effort to Industry
It seems a far cry from planes and ships and submar-
ines to industry and business activities. But the utility of the
mathematical models is their wide range of applicability. One
possible business application of search theory comes in the
problem of assignment of sales effort. Suppose a business
has a limited number of salesmen, who are to cover a wide
variety of dealers. Some of these dealers are large stores,
which usually will produce large orders when visited, some are

A farmer discovers that a forest fire is

miles per hour and is at the moment, ex-

country at the rate of 6 miles per hour,
he can easily escape the fire. His wife,
however, can make only 4 miles per hour.
Then there's a baby girl who has to be
carried, and this cuts down the speed of
either parent by 1 mile per hour. There's
also a boy who can run a mile in 15

until he can start a foot. Carrying him
retards the speed of either parent by 2

can take his wife's arm when he is going
at a faster rate than hers; and that in-
creases her speed by Y2 mile per hour.

sales return. If there are enough salesmen,
every dealer can be visited every month,
and the optimum number of sales can be
made, although the sales cost will be
high. With fewer salesmen available,
search theory indicates that the larger
stores should be visited more often than
the small stores; with very few salesmen
it may be that only the large stores should
be visited. If the probable return per
visit for each store is known, the opti-
mum distribution of sales effort can then
be calculated.
An interesting and typical variation on
this problem comes when we consider the
action of the individual salesmen, when
we try to make their behavior conform
to the best over-all distribution for the
company. For each individual salesman,
with his limited effort, it may be best
for him to visit only the large stores; if
his visits are uncontrolled and if he is
paid a flat commission, it may turn out
that the large stores are visited too often,
the small stores too seldom, for best re-
turns for the company as a whole. It

then becomes necessary to work out a
system of incentive commissions designed
to induce the salesmen to spread their
efforts more evenly between large and
small customers. If the general theory has
been worked out, this additional compli-
cation can be added without too much
difficulty.
This problem of balancing the ten-
dencies of different parts of a large or-
ganization is one which is often encoun-
tered in industrial Operations Research.
The sales force is out to increase sales of
all items, though some items may return
less profit than others. Production resists
changeover to making another product,
though sales on the other product are in-
creasing; and the financial department
frowns on building up large inventories,
though small inventories always put the
production division at the mercy of sales
fluctuations. It is often not too difficult
to suboptimize each of these divisions
separately, so each is running smoothly
and effectively in so far as its own part of
the business is concerned. But to be sure
that all these parts mesh together to make

the company as a whole operate most ef-
ficiently requires much more subtle an-
alysis and very careful quantitative balanc-
ing.
In the interest of reducing factory over-
time and to keep down inventory, for
example, it may be necessary to modify
the salesman's incentive commissions, so
he will be induced to push one line over
another. It may be necessary for the pro-
duction division to allow more overtime
in one department than another, to make
some part of its operation run at less than
optimum in order that the over-all opera-
tion be optimum; and one must take care
not to penalize the production depart-
ment, by reduced bonuses or the like,
for reducing its efficiency so that the ef-
fectiveness of the whole is improved.
But perhaps these few simple examples
are enough to show that the research tech-
niques developed to increase our under-
standing of the nature of the physical
world also can be used to help us under-
stand operational problems. In many
cases in industry and war, a simplified
quantitative model of the situation can
help us see what goes on and can help us
devise the best way to proceed. In many
cases it is not necessary to have a com-
plete picture of all that goes on, clear
down to all the basic details. As long as
our mathematical model can be adjusted
to fit some of the regularities which ap-
pear, we can abstract these parts of the
behavior from the rest and study them
separately. The process of abstraction, of
keeping dear of local details, has the ad-
vantage of providing a model which may
fit a variety of circumstances—restaurants,
production lines, or landing aircraft. By
gaining in generality, of course, we lose
in detail.
Perhaps it also can be seen that such
methods probably cannot be used to solve
all problems. Just as it is quite unlikely
that the methods of analysis used so suc-
cessfully in genetics can be used to solve
all biological problems, for example, so
it is unlikely that the Operations Research
scientist, with his specialized techniques
of analysis, can ever replace the usual
business executives or army generals, with
their practical experience and their intui-
tive grasp of the complicated effects of
morale and applied psychology, for ex-
ample.

"A Liberal Education Includes Science"
We all have our sensitive points, little-
things which annoy us even if they
shouldn't. I have mine. When I pick up
the paper and learn that someone has
been killed because a current of eleven
thousand volts entered his body I am
annoyed at the writer. Or when I read
a paper by a supposedly learned author,
who says that so and so required a
hundred watts of energy I can't read
further. Such misuse of scientific terms
and indeed of the English language make
me very unhappy, because often it is
done by an author who will turn right
around and claim that Engineers and
Scientists are uncouth, uncultured and
should be exposed to the benefits of a
liberal education. Having thus started, the
advocate of this point of view goes on
to say that we, as Engineers, ought to
take more English, more economics, and
more history so that we can be articulate
Compiled by the FEATURES STAFF
and make ourselves understood by mod-
ern society.
I won't deny that engineers should be
more articulate, but I ask, 'How can
anyone speak to another if the other docs
not understand the language which, of
necessity, must be used ?" The terms volts,
amperes, kilowatts, horsepower, force,
mass, etc., are just as much a part of
our language as the terms red and blue,
light, heavy, solid, etc. As a matter of
fact, it often happens that these terms,
which had their origin in science, are
more precise and more definite than many
that did not and for that reason alone,
particular care is needed in their use.
Wc as Engineering Educators have
long admitted that our students do not
spend as much time taking courses in the
social sciences and humanities as we
would like. Few Engineering students get
more than a scattering of courses in these
subjects. Yet, we do get some economics,
some history, some English and occa-

sets, bridges, buildings, aircraft, trains and
other products of modern science exert a
profound influence on our existence and
must be talked about. Should not those
who claim to be students of the liberal
arts learn at least a smattering of science?
I believe that in order to be liberally
educated every college student should
take at least one course in science in
which he would learn the simpler funda-
mental laws of nature, a few of the defi-
nitions of common physical quantities,
the methods of their precise measure-
ment and their application to the ma-
chines of modern life. If liberal education
means what I hope it does then cer-
tainly science is as much a part of that
education as literature, music, and art.

Men Tend to Be Negative
It is much easier to be negative than to
stay positive. All life around us is sub-
jected to great negatives. Let a building
simply stand, and it deteriorates. Just live,
after you've reached maturity, and your
physical abilities begin to fade. It takes
no effort to be mediocre or inferior . . .
but it takes constant effort to excel. Many
men, therefore, succumb to the negatives
around them. They rise, have a brief burst
of glory like a signal rocket, and then
fade, never to be seen again.
Negatives Could Rule Our Lives
It is easier to tear down than to build.
It is easier to lose a temper than to
control it.

TAKE YOUR PLACE
IN A FIELD WITH A FUTURE
Is there still some question in your mind as to
just, where you fit into the engineering picture?
If there is . . . and you want to apply your abil-
ity to a wide scope of industrial and scientific
activity . . . consider the expanding field of
instrumentation.
The increasing use of instruments to control
production lines ... to test products ... to solve
research problems is reflected in the spectacular
growth of the field. In recent years, sales of elec-
trical measuring instruments have risen 455%
and sales of scientific instruments 655%.
Here at Leeds &amp; Northrup, we help to meet
these demands for more and better instrumentation.
We are a leading supplier of automatic, high pre-
cision, balance-type electrical instruments for
many segments of industry. Our automatic and
manual laboratory-type instruments for the worker
in science and research are recognized throughout
the world. In addition, we are among the leading
makers of furnaces for heat treating.
Perhaps your opportunity is in our sales engineer-
ing division—helping to analyze and to solve the
instrumentation problems of our customers. Or, as
a market development engineer, you would be con-
cerned with fitting L&amp;N instruments to new groups
of applications. Your interest may he in the design
and manufacturing of L&amp;N products. If so, you
may qualify for an opening in product engineering,
industrial engineering, research, inspection or else-
where among our 3000 people.
Decide now to investigate your place in the field
of instrumentation. Ask your placement officer for
a copy of our booklet, "Career Opportunities"
which describes the highlights about L&amp;N. Or,

by jets may be necessary. When there is
need for turbulance over the entire grate,
the number of jets may be determined by
means of Table 2. Over ail jet entrances
to refractory furnaces, a small ledge of
fire brick is used to prevent slag from
clogging the aperture or diverting the
steam onto either the fuel bed or the
walls; in the first event, a clinker is form-
ed meaning wasted fuel; in the second, a
burnout of the wall may occur.
Jets need not be in constant operation
and this is an economy feature, in fact
many devices can be rigged for manual or
automatic cut-in and shut-off of the jets.
Jets are used on all types of power plants;
including both stationary and movable
boilers; from locomotives to riverboats.
In answer to a few questions:
(1) Are modern overfire jets patented?
No. Anyone is free to build, install or
sell modern overfire jets of the design il-
lustrated above. They were developed
by Battelle Memorial Institute under the
sponsorship of Bituminous Coal Re-
search, Inc.
(2) Who can manufacture modern
overfire jets?
Heating, Ventilating and Piping con-
tractors can fabricate them or they can be
made in any plant maintenance shop from
standard pipe and fittings.
(3) What is the cost of modern over-
fire jets?
The cost will obviously vary with the
number and size of jets required and the
conditions of installation. When specific
requirements have been worked out for
the furnace in question the cost can be
estimated locally.
(4) How much steam will modern
steam-air jets require?
Figure 8. Steam jet for turbulence alone.
About 2% of rated boiler output.
(5) What are the comparative installa-
tion and operating costs of steam-air and
blower jets?
Installation costs for steam-air jets are
lower but the operating costs of the
blower jets are lower since they are more
efficient air movers.
Benefits, other than smoke abatement,
that have accompanied the use of overfire
jets include: (1) reduction of slag and
soot formations on boiler tubes, (2)
shortening of the flame and reduction of
the final temperatures when surfaces are
of the same degree of cleanliness, (3)
ability to operate with slightly lower ex-
cess air without unburned combustible
gases, (4) increase in boiler and furnace
efficiency, (5) reduction of both quantity
and carbon content of the cinder carry-
over and (6) substantial increase in the
"no smoke" limit of the furnace.
Overfire jets can correct many diffi-
ciencies, but they are not a cure-all for
smoke caused by poor engineering, inade-
quate equipment or poor firing practice.
They should be installed as a tool for
smoke abatement to supplement careful,
intelligent operation of hand and stoker
fired furnaces. Even with the best super-
vision and operating practice, most plants
have some stage in their operating cycle
when jets can be advantageously used to
keep smoke formation to a minimum.

An elderly couple had been married
sixty years. The husband was asked if they
had any quarrels during that time. His
reply was no. He was then asked the
secret of such a happy marriage. This was
his answer. "Right after we were mar-
ried we went to the mountains for our
honeymoon. We went horseback riding.
On the way up to the top of the mountain
her horse stumbled, I looked at the horse
and said 'That's once.' We went a little
farther and her horse stumbled again. I
looked at her horse and said 'that's twice.'
We continued on our way and her horse
stumbled again. I looked at her horse and
said 'that's three times.' I then got off
my horse and walked to her's and shot the
horse. I put my wife on my horse, I got
on, and we started on up the mountain.
She began to chew me out for shooting
the poor horse. I listened carefully until
she had finished and then I turned to her
and said, 'That's once'."

DRAWING BOARDS
Visionary Young Engineers Work Years Ahead on Jet Fighter-Bomber Design...
There's drama on the drawing boards at Republic!
A great new jet fighter-bomber is being created,
years ahead of its time. Like its famous predeces-
sors, it will be the product of young men of
vision, working in an atmosphere encouraging
individual initiative.
For, Republic has long believed that its engi-
neers are creative men who cannot be cast into a
mold and still maintain the individuality and
imagination that are the lifestream of aviation.
At Republic, the ability and creativity of the
engineer thrives on a diet of challenging assign-
ments that permit him to probe and express new
ideas.
This approach has been notably successful. Since
1931, Republic has been a leader in the aircraft
industry, and today employs over 27,000 people,
with an engineer ratio of 1 to 8. From the first
all-metal plane to the famous Thunderbolts,
Thunder jets, and Thunderstreaks, Republic planes
have been pace-setters in aviation. And Republic
engineers, sharing in this success, are at the peak
of their profession, earning top pay in industry.
Republic engineers know, too, the pleasures of
good living. Centrally located on Long Island,
with its model suburban communities and abun-
dance of year-round recreational facilities, Republic
is less than an hour from New York City and its
unparalleled cultural and entertainment
attractions.
For further information concerning our training
programs, which prepare graduate engineers for
positions in aircraft engineering or manufacturing
supervision, please write directly to your special
Republic representative, Mr. Charles J. Kelson,
Employment Manager.

design must first bo simple
... Inexpensive to produce.
HOW TO ELIMINATE
COSTLY OPERATIONS
IN DESIGN
BEFORE any design is acceptable,
methods and costs of production
are carefully studied. Every needless
expense in material and machinery is
eliminated to meet price demands of
competition.
By using steel instead of cast iron,
substantial savings in material can be
realized. Steel is three times stronger,
2Vi times as rigid as iron. As a result,
only one-half to one-third the amount
of metal is needed with steel. Also,
steel costs only one-third the price of
iron, pound for pound.
In manufacture, welded steel com-
ponents can be produced today at an
average of 50% less cost. Production
methods are simpler . . . fewer man-
hours are involved with arc welding.
With welded steel construction,
ultimate savings are limited only by
the ingenuity of the designer. For this
reason, every product engineer needs
to keep in step with the rapid prog-
ress in low cost manufacturing with
arc welding.
Meter Swing Bote is fabricated at low cost
from tubingand steel plate. Welds are made
with "hidden-arc"process in agglomerated
flux, using Manual Lincolnweld.
DESIGN AIDS FOR LOW COST
Principles el designing er converting existing
products in welded steel are presented in Lincoln
Weldesign Manual available at nominal cost for
hours of study. Write for free design bulletins to

SLIDE RULE BALL
The giant slide rule hung undisturbed
in the League Ballroom this year at the
engineers twenty-fifth annual formal
dance, March twentieth. About one hun-
dred and fifty engineers and their dates
attended. The dance entitled "Spring
Prelude" featured Mel Sachs and his
orchestra. Entertainment during intermis-
sion was furnished by the Novelairs. All
of the Technic staff worked to make the
dance a success. Marge Maurer and Bob
Constant were co-chairman. Larry Mack
and Jim Snediker were in charge of
tickets, and Chuck Stickels publicity. Pro-
grams and invitations to patrons were by
Carley Conrad and Adrienne Haigan. The
Triangles furnished additional help. The
dance was judged one of the most suc-
cessful in many years and we of the
Techhic Staff hope that everyone had as
nice a time as we did.
WRITING AWARDS
The contest for articles on welding
sponsored by The Lincoln Electric Com-
pany is still open but contestants should
notify Bob Constant, Editor of the
Technic, immediately. Here on campus
one hundred dollars is being offered for
the best essay on Materials Handling.
Those wishing to enter should consult the
notice in the Industrial Engineering Lab-
oratory and see Professor Page of the I.E.
department.
A.S.M.E.
At a combined meeting with the
A.S.C.E. Mr. William Hirsch of the Lin-
coln arc-welding Foundation spoke on
"Welded Design" and movies were
shown. A field trip was made to The
Clark Equipment Company in Jackson.
The subject of the tour was the manu-
facture and assembly of transmission
units.
A.I.E.E.—I.R.E. and A.S.M.E.
At combined meeting of the A.I.E.E.—-
I.R.E. and A.S.M.E. Mr. Southworth from
Consumers Power Co. spoke of the pro-
duction of electric power, and transmis-
sion of power. He discussed coal trans-
port and processing, control of boilers,
and the layout of a power plant. He de-
scribed types and styles of turbines, cycles
of steam and water, and the functions of
the condenser and cooling water. His talk
was illustrated with slides, and served as
an introduction to what was seen on the
field trip, March 13. A total of 69 me-
chanical and electrical engineers went on
this field trip to the Justin R. Whiting
Plant of Consumers Power Co. in Eire,
Michigan. Leaving here at 9:00 a.m. they
arrived in Eire at 11:00 and had lunch in
the plant cafeteria. After talks given by
the various heads of departments they
divided into groups and toured the plant.
Equipment of impressive size was seen
such as one Turbo-Generator rated at
106,000 K.W. and two others at 80,000
K. W. Three boilers handling 890,000 lb.
per hour were in the plant. The plant
transmits 140,000 volts. Besides viewing
the equipment the students learned some-
thing about the operating procedure of a
power plant. At 6:00 the group had
turkey dinner at the Dearborn Inn. A
one and one-half hour question period
followed.
A.S.M.E.
April 14, Mr. Danly, vice president of
Danly Machine Specialty Corp of Chi-

become clear what operational situations
can be analyzed by its means and what
situations cannot. Already there are Oper-
ations Research teams working closely
with military and industrial administra-
tors, exploring these possibilities, report-
ing their findings to the administrator that
he may be able to combine their quanti-
tative results with his experience and
judgment to reach more understanding
decisions.
In general, scientists and engineers
have not been active in administering
government or business. This is not sur-
prising, for the business of science is to
understand, not to act. In Operation Re-

neer can provide a better understanding
of operational problems so administrative
decisions can be made wisely.

YOUR BEARING NOTEBOOK
Jet's wheel bearings have
to take three kinds of forces
When the F86-D Sabre Jet lands—the wheel bearings
take a triple beating. There's the initial landi ng shock,
an almost instantaneous acceleration; and, if there's a
crosswind, heavy thrust loads. Bendix and North
American solved this triple punch problem by using
Timken® tapered roller bearings for all three landing
wheels. Their tapered design enables them to take
radial and thrust loads in any combination. And
Timken bearings' true rolling motion and incredibly
smooth surface finish practically eliminate friction
permitting rapid acceleration.
Line contact helps TIMKEN bearings
take jet landing load
This cross-section drawing shows one reason Timken bearings are
ideal for taking the heavy landing load of the plane itself. Note the
full line of contact between rollers and races. This gives Timken
bearings high load capacity. It's a basic advantage of roller bearings.

It is easier to criticise someone else
than to construct something ourselves.
Keep Your Attitudes Positive
And, unfortunately, it is easy to attack
the ideals and allegiances of others be-
cause to the attacker it gives a warm glow
of superiority ... at no expense of real
thought.
But all of these easy actions are nega-
tive. They represent the actions which
degrade man, and have destroyed nations.
And if engineers fall into the habits
which are characteristic of undisciplined
minds, they will find in life only those
rewards gained by the undisciplined and
unskilled masses. And the satisfactions
and responsibilities of professional life
will never be realized.
Check Your Attitude Toward Your
Colleagues
If you want to call a man a scoundrel
... a dozen earthy terms spring up . . .
with many to spare; but if we want to
praise a man, we are at a loss for words.
Radio, television, the movies, and the
(Continued from page 48)
fiction we read, as well as the stage plays
we watch, are filled with people on the
negative side of life. For every character
whom we would like to invite into our
homes, there are possibly a dozen who
ought to be rounded up by the police or a
competent psychiatrist. And this constant
outpouring of the negative is bound to
have an adverse effect unless we make a
strong, conscious ecort to counteract it.
What do you think of your colleagues?
Are you proud of the good you see in
them, or constantly disgruntled by their
shortcomings? Do you see admirable
qualities in some of them, or are you
blinded by the mirroring of your own
weaknesses in their lives?
Think negatively about them, and
you'll sink into the morass of mediocrity
which seems to surround you. Think posi-
tively, and you'll be challenged and in-
spired by the heights of character and
towers of strength in your midst.
No crusade ever succeeded if it was
simply a fight against something. To be
successful, you must be for something so
strongly that nothing can divert you. For
Mass production is the key to America's
industrial development and every manu-

Success Is Positive
The man who builds a mental picture
of himself succeeding . . . always, most
often does succeed. The student who is
licked before he goes into his exams most
frequently fails. It is perfectly possible to
be modest, and at the same time certain
of success. Always evaluate your abilities
positively—and you enhance your chances.
Keep obstacles out of your imagination.
Minimize them. Remember this: reasons
"why not" are always obvious and plenti-
ful; but like the good fruit on a tree, rea-
sons "why" are scarce—and you must
climb to get them.
Seek the best solution to your problem
instead of copying that which fits another.
Drive yourself to stretch your capabilities,
instead of aiming at another's goal. Seek
contentment, but don't ever be satisfied.
Make confidence in yourself your domin-
ating habit, and always shake off the sense
of inadequacy that comes with every re-
buff in life. Remember that every suc-
cessful person has built on the ashes of
his temporay defeats, to rise higher than
before.

The subject of atmospheric pollution control has been a very active one in
recent years. Since 1934 the Universiy has engaged in studies of atmospheric
sanitation. More recently this has been in combination with theoretical studies
and reports on atmospheric diffusion of the stack gases. Most of this work is
conducted as projects in the Engineering Research Institute.
The behavior of the stack plume is a function of the momentum of the emerg-
ing gases as a favorable factor and the momentum of the passing wind as an
unfavorable factor. In the wind tunnel tests the smoke consists of a mixture of
oil vapor and steam which is emitted under conditions of controlled velocity
and temperature.
The study of atmospheric sanitation has been an outgrowth of a project
which was started at the University in 1927 for the National Electric Light Asso-
ciation to determine the storm loading and strength of electric power lines. An
important part of that study consisted also of a study of wind structure. This
work has been an interesting illustration of the necessity for cooperation be-
tween different fields, in this case between civil engineering, aeronautical
engineering, and meteorology.

THE ENGINEERING COUNCIL
During the past two months the Steering Committee with
the cooperation of interested organizations and students has
been writing a constitution for the creation of a new Engi-
neering council. Their work has now been completed and
in all likelihood the new Council will be ready to start its
work later this semester.
The main functions of the Council will be to coordinate
the activities of the different enginering organizations, to
sponsor and support projects that would be of service and
interest of the students and College, and to gather and
formulate student opinions on College policies affecting
the student body.
The membership of new Council will consist of the
presidents of professional engineering societies, class presi-
dents, and representatives from the Technic, Tau Beta
Pi, and the Honor Council and three appointed members at
large. All meetings will be open and the floor available to
any student or faculty member of the College of Engi-
neering.
Today we have many active organizations sponsoring
some very interesting and informative activities, but many
of these projects fall short of their goal mainly because
these organizations work in their own local sphere. Many
of the students do not know what each organization is do-
ing. By bringing together all the organizations and the
student body the Engineering Council can make student
activities more successful. The Council could also under-
take other all college projects that no organization now
sponsors.
The Engineering Council will be a welcome addition to
our present extracurricular set up. An active council can
perform a service to both the students and the Engineering
College.

SOME COMMENTS ON MECHANICS
Engineers have long been famous for their practical
mindedness. Much of the training they receive is planned
to make them capable of analyzing the problems they are
confronted with carefully and logically so they will be
able to arrive at some solution or conclusion.
Every course offered does of course furnish the student
with knowledge and training that can be applied in the
solution of problems. But most courses are information
courses, useful in the solution of specific problems. There
are some courses though that help develop a thought pat-
tern that is useful not only in the solution of problems in
that specific course but in life in general. The basic courses
in engineering mechanics (EM 1-5) seem in the opinion
of this writer to fit this latter category.
Engineering mechanics is a very practical course. After
completing it a student has a better understanding of what
makes an airplane fly, what determines the size and shape
of cables used in a suspension bridge, what minimum
speed a jet must have to escape the earth's gravitational
field, what makes the Empire Building stand up and so on.
Aside from the practical knowledge gained in mechanics
what perhaps is more important is the method used in
solving problems and reaching conclusions in those courses.
To be a little more specific, a common problem in me-
chanics is to study the behavior of a building or bridge
structure under different loads. Such an analysis might
seem very difficult, but a person who has taken mechanics
will immediately visualize what procedure is to be used in
solving such a problem. First he will determine the forces
acting in the structure as a system, then proceed to break
the structure down into its components and study the be-
havior of each component separately. Such a procedure
will resolve a rather difficult problem into a series of simple
mathematical additions and multiplications (Sum of the
forces = zero and the sum of the moments = zero).
Once the behavior of each component has been determined
it will not be hard to predict if the structure will stand up
or crumble under the given load.
A similar method of attack is many times helpful in the
solution of problems we meet every day. All of us make
many decisions every day. Some require much thought
while others we make intuitively. But before we can render
any wise decision we must have the question involved
clearly in our mind, and then proceed to use our knowledge
and experience to solve it. A logical method of approach
often makes a difficult problem not so difficult.
On many occasions we have a feeling the answer to a
certain problem should be one way, while in reality it is
much different. Sometimes our feelings are so strong as to
make us refuse to accept the truth. Much effort is required
to convince a person that when he gets hit by a car, while
crossing the street, he hits the car with the same force that
it hits him, yet this same person will not argue the validity
of Newton's third law that states "for every action there is
an equal and opposite reaction." A study in mechancs
helps one to think scientifically, that is base his convictions
on evidence rather than pure intuition.
A great knowledge of subject matter is not sufficient in
the solution of problems. The ability to use knowledge is
what makes it useful.

Ball-and-socket joint cast iron pipe for water main crossing river at Newark, Ohio
Where installations are planned for long-term
service to assure low cost per service year, engineers
rely on cast iron pipe as a dependable and adapt-
able material. Consequently, it is specified for a
wide variety of applications, both utility and in-
dustrial, including water supply, sewerage, fire
protection, process industries and many forms of
special construction. Long life and low maintenance
cost are proved results of the high beam-strength,
compressive-strength, shock-strength and effective
resistance to corrosion of cast iron pipe. Cast Iron

Because of its unique construc-

makes it extremely useful in
bearing applications where space
and weight are at a premium.
For a given load capacity, the
Needle Bearing is the smallest
and most compact anti-friction
bearing available, giving the
designer many opportunities to
reduce the size and weight of sur-

What's more, the Needle Bear-

Since a press fit in a simple

is required to locate a Needle

necessary. And, since the Needle
Bearing usually runs directly on
a hardened shaft—without an in-

space and weight are gained.

INTERCONNECTION
For many years officials of the Detroit
Edison Company and their neighbors
across the river, the Hydro-Electric Power
Commission of Ontario, have been dis-
cussing the possibility of linking together
their two systems. Such a connection, be-
cause of the way each company generates
its power, would be of considerable ad-
vantage to each both during routine oper-
ations and particularly, in times of emer-
gency.
The Detroit Edison system of approxi-
mately 2.2 million kilowatts, backed by
some 1.9 millions of other Michigan sys-
tems with which it is interconnected,
generates practically all of its power by
steam plants. The Hydro-Electric system
of about 3.5 million kilowatts, as the
name implies, has about 80 percent water
power and only 20 per cent steam power.
As it was summed up by Mr. Howard P.
Seelye, Manager of Engineering, Detroit
Edison, "Detroit's position in industry is
well known and Western Ontario is also
heavily industrialized along the border,
with many plants on both sides taking
part in defense production. Mutual help
in time of emergency outages of lines or
equipment on either system is an obvious
possibility with two systems of this size,
and is of course one of the chief reasons
for makng a tie. The yearly and seasonal
fluctuations in available water on a large
scale water-power system lead to consid-
erable amounts of incidental off-peak
energy, which can be delivered to a steam-
power system to displace its own genera-
tion and save fuel. Conversely, at times of
low-water on the water-power system, the
available flow can be conserved for use
during high load periods by taking off-
peak energy from the steam-power sys-
tem."
About two years ago officials of both
companies decided that the economies and
conveniences this connection offered were
definitely advantageous, and planning of
the various stages of the project was be-
gun.
The design of the needed facilities pro-
ceeded smoothly. It was decided that an
interchange on the order of 200 to 300
Mw was feasible and the ties were located
so that neither company would need very
many additional transmission lines. Two
by CHUCK STICKELS, '56Chem.E
ties were proposed, one between the Del-
ray Power Plant of Detroit Edison in De-
troit and Hydro's J. Clark Keith Generat-
ing Station in Windsor, Ontario; the
other about 50 miles away between the
Detroit Edison's Marysville Power Plant
at Marysville, Michigan, and Hydro's
Samia Transformer Station near Sarnia,
Ontario.
Although no new or unusual features
were incorporated in these connections,
the work was made more interesting be-

cause the crossing of two major rivers,
the St. Clair River at Sarnia and the De-
troit River at Detroit, was involved. Over-
head crossings were decided upon in
preference to a submarine cable since
there is considerable current in both
rivers, and more pertinently, overhead
crossings are cheaper and easier to main-
tain. The two ties would be quite similar
with spans of about 2,400 feet each. The
crossing towers, acting as supports only,
would be approximately 300 feet high
with adjacent 200 foot towers taking the
line tension. The mid-span clearance
above the water was to be about 180 feet.

While all this planning proceeded prac-
tically without a hitch, considerable diffi-
culty was being encountered in a different
direction. It seems that Detroit Edison
transmits all its power within the State of
Michigan and thus was not classed as a
"public utility" according to the Federal
Power Act and for this season was not
subject to regulation by the Federal Power
Commission. The FPC had made a ruling
to the effect that ". . . ownership or
operation of facilities for the transmission
of electric energy from a point within a
State to a foreign country makes one a
"public utility" under the Federal Power
Act, even though the portion of such fa-
cilities in this country is located wholly
within such State." Detroit Edison took
the position that this ruling was in con-
flict with certain sections of the Federal
Power Act and so an amendment to this
act was introduced in Congress. This
amendment would exclude the owner of
such transmission facilities from regula-
tion as a "public utility" under other pro-
visions of the Act.
After a considerable amount of hag-
gling, with the Federal Power Commis-
sion first opposing and then backing the
amendment, the bill was made law. The
Canadian government had extended their
approval earlier, so the actual stringing
of cables began. (The erection of the
crossing and archoring towers was com-
pleted prior to the passage of the amend-
ment.)
A word might be in order about these
crossing and anchoring towers. Three con-
crete piles were driven under each leg
of the crossing tower down 87 feet to
hard pan. Piers were built over these piles
and the four piers tied together diagon-
ally and around the square. The entire

against slippage toward the river by steel
piling driven 20 feet into the earth, 150
feet back of the tower and connected
to the foundation by five 3 inch steel
rods. Two concrete piles were placed
under each "uplift" leg of the Delray
anchor tower, and three under each "com-
pression" leg.
Now the most interesting and unusual
phase of the operation began. The string-
ing of the cables connecting the two sys-
tems was a most challenging job. Naviga-
tion on these rivers is among the heaviest
anywhere in the world with the average
frequency of ships being one every 15
minutes. In addition there is a current of
four miles per hour in the Detroit River
and six miles per hour in the St. Clair
River. To install the five wires at each
crossing without interfering with river
traffic required excellent timing and very
efficient team-work. Each crossing was
strung in only one day, with the Sarnia
operation taking only five hours.
The method used was this: One end of
the wire was fastened to the anchor
tower on the U.S. side and passed over
blocks on the crossing tower, and the
reel of wire was loaded on the stern of a
tug. (During the Sarnia crossing a tug
and a motor-driven barge were used, the
wire being loaded on the barge. When
the tug neared the shallow water on the
Canadian side the barge cast off and pro-
ceeded ashore under its own power.) The
tug passed the cable over a scow about 50
yards from the United States shore to
free it from any possible obstruction in
the water near the shore. As the tug
moved across the river the cable was
played out and allowed to sink to the bot-
tom of the river. The effects of river
currents and the craft involved were
studied before the operation began so
that the cable when on the bottom would
be in line with the crossing towers on
either bank. On the Canadian shore, the
remaining wire was unreeled, hoisted to
the top of the 300 foot crossing tower,
and passed over the tower to a tractor
which pulled the wire up out of the river
to near its final position. Here the wire
was anchored temporarily and the follow-
ing day after all five wires were strung,
each was pulled up to its final sag and
anchored to the anchor tower.
This whole operation had to be syn-
chronized with shipping movement on
the rivers. The United States Coast Guard
and the marine division of the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police patrolled the
rivers, warned approaching ships of the
construction, and gave the signal when
there was a sufficient interval between
ships for the tug to cross (10 minutes was
allowed) or for the cable to be hoisted
(20 minutes necessary). The two RCMP
boats, four Coast Guard boats, and the
construction crews were all linked to-
gether by ship-to-shore radio. Through
close cooperation, some excellent timing,
and a little bit of luck, it was not neces-
sary to stop any ships and in only two
cases was a slight slow-down requested.
These ties—believed to be the largest
international power exchange in the world
—were put in operation last October and
their performance has lived up to expecta-
tions. Since Hydro-Electric had an un-
usually dry season on its watersheds last
summer and fall it has been restricted
in the amount of water available for gen-
erating energy. The early completion of
the connection has allowed Hydro to draw
energy from Detroit Edison at hours off
the system peak, and is thus useful in
conserving water. The practical operation

ENGINEER
by JAMES H. CAMPBELL
Vice-President, Consumers Power Corporation
This is a reprint of a speech, given by Mr.
Campbell, at the Tau Beta Pi Initiation Ban-
quet, April 20. The Editors of the Technic
felt that Mr. Campbell's message had a timeli-
ness and value that made it worth the attention
of not fust Tau Beta Pi members, but of all
undergraduate engineers.
I have approached the opportunity of
addressing this group with a great deal of
pleasure. It is an honor to be your speaker
and because you are a fine engineering
group it is a unique opportunity to make
some observations about engineers and
engineering.
Although my audience is made up of
Tau Beta Pi members of different ages
and a wide diversity of experience, I am
going to address my remarks to the young-
er element of the group. I trust what I
have to say will be confirmed by the ex-
perience of the older members with us
tonight.
I am going to take advantage of the
fact that this is a unique group and be
very frank in what I have to say. Within
the next few months most of you are
going to leave the rather sheltered life of
the university campus to enter the busi-
ness world. It is a world full of oppor-
tunity but it is a demanding world. In
taking this step, it seems to me that you
must shoulder some responsibilities.
First, you have a responsibility to your-
self to develop the full measure of talent
with which you have been endowed and
for which you can claim no credit. You
owe this to the men and women who have
guided you to this point in your life—
the parents who have sacrificed for your
welfare and the teachers who have labor-
ed to bring you learning.
You have a responsibility to the pro-
fession you are about to enter. As engi-
neers you are expected to set for yourself
standards that are a credit to the profes-
sion and an example for those whom you
contact.
Finally, you have a responsibility to the
society and economy in which you ex-
pect to make your mark. The boundless
opportunity, the freedom of action and
the standard of living that are yours are
there as a result of our free enterprise
way of doing things in America. During
your early lifetime significant inroads
have been made in our way of life by
those who embrace the ideology of a con-
trolled economy. In my opinion such a
system reduces opportunity for the indi-
vidual, restricts his freedom of action,
and as we have observed in other parts
of the world, lowers the standard of liv-
ing for all. Such a system is in general
opposed to the fundamental principles
that have made this country great. In
joining the business world you acquire a
voice in the direction of it and in the
years to come some of you will become
influential in determining whether we are
to strengthen our free enterprise system
or drift toward a controlled system. I
would like to charge you with the re-
sponsibility of seeing that your sons at
some future Tau Beta Pi dinner can look
ahead to as bright a picture of opportun-
ity as you do today, to as much individual
opportunity and freedom of action.
In choosing an engineering education
as your initial preparation for the place
you wish to make for yourself in the busi-
ness world, you have counted on definite
advantages to be derived from this course
of study.
The most obvious advantage to those
looking forward to an industrial career is
the great and increasing demand for grad-
uate engineers, an insatiable demand that
is the result of the increasing part technol-
ogy plays in modern industry. There are
few fields remaining in industry today
where knowledge of engineering matters
is not helpful in guiding the operations
of a business. This situation is not all
moonlight and roses, though, and I shall
allude to it again.
A less obvious, but far more important
advantage of an engineering education, is
derived from the disciplines imposed by
an engineering curriculum, a course of ac-
tion that places emphasis on the logical
treatment of facts. A graduate who has
truly capitalized on the disciplines of his
engineering training surely must have
learned the importance of facts in any
situation and the necessity for separating
the wheat from the chaff in proceeding
to a logical conclusion. The affairs of our
present-day world have become so com-
plex that this training has acquired para-
mount importance. But facility in dealing
with facts is not enough. Another factor
in the equation must be considered and
it is in this area that I wish to spend
some time with you.
Unfortunately, there are mixed bless-
ings in concentrating one's efforts on an
engineering education. The same disci-
pline that places engineers in an advan-
tageous position may sometimes erect a
barrier to the full development of a man's
potential for success. The discipline that
teaches us a healthy respect for facts may
breed a dogmatic stubbornness in an in-
dividual. It is easy for the engineering
graduate to be so sure of the adequacy of
his approach that he fails to take into
account the viewpoints of others. He may
fail utterly in his contacts with the non-
engineering portions of our society. The
man who allows himself to develop in
this manner builds about himself a shell,
a shell made up of the scientific knowl-
edge he has acquired during his schol-
astic and professional career. Such a shell
can effectively insulate a man from the
world of other men. Instead of becoming
an engineer in the true sense of the
word, he may become a technician.
A technician may be described as one
versed or skilled in the technical details
of a subject or art; in other words, a per-
son completely familiar with the affairs
inside his own special field, but not neces-
sarily acquainted or even aware of the ef-
fects of outside forces on his undertakings
or the impact of what he does on other
fields.
Engineering, on the other hand, might
be described as the science of controlling
the forces and utilizing the materials of
nature for the benefit of man, and the
art of organizing and directing human
activities in achieving those ends. Here
we visualize an entirely different sort of
individual, a man fully acquainted with
the technical details of his field but also
aware of the manner in which his efforts
fit the whole picture. The engineer whose
efforts are in harmony with this descrip-
tion is necessarily a man whose interests
radiate far beyond the specific area in
which he has been educated. Mark it well,
an engineer is an organizer and director
of men. He is aware that he can't lay the
bricks himself and that in order to carry
out his engineered plans he must suc-
14

him. There is probably no ability, other
than sheer technical competence, so im-
portant to the modern engineer as his
ability to communicate effectively with
others in his profession, and what's more
important, with those outside his profes-
sion. It has always seemed unfortunate
to me that engineering students look upon
the study of English as they do, as a
necessary evil to shun as they would the
plague. It is your language and one of the
first aims of any educated man should
be facility with his language. When you
get right down to it, language is the
principal achievement which sets men
apart from apes.
I would seriously urge that you seek
to master all of the communicative tech-
niques. Training in logical thinking cer-
tainly should supply you with an ad-
vantage. Any idea, whether it be spoken
or written, must be logically formulated
in order to be readily understood. But
disciplined thought is of little value if the
ordinary tools of self-expression have not
been sharpened. An idea inadequately
communicated might just as well never
have been born.
It seems to me that there is no room in
my description for the dogmatic two-plus-
two-equals-four, black-is-black, and white-
is-white attitude. The educated man we
are talking about has a flexible mental at-
titude. He has come to the conclusion that
two and two may sometimes well equal
twenty-two, and he has discovered that
there are many shades of gray between
black and white. He has benefited from
his association with others by making an
effort to see things as they see them, and
he realizes that a large share of his activi-
ties involve human considerations where
the techniques of applied science and
engineering do not govern.
I have used the expression "flexible
mental attitude." What does it mean?
Well, first of all, it does not mean namby-
pamby vacillation. Nor does it imply
wide-eyed susceptibility to every argument
that comes down the pike. It does demand
an open, inquiring frame of mind which
readily seizes upon the virtues of any
point of view. It does demand the guts to
admit you are wrong. It does imply a
willingness to encourage others to express
an opinion—and to give them a receptive
audience. It does require strength of con-
viction—once you have weighed the evi-
dence—and willingness to speak out ac-
cordingly.
To aspire to become the sort of indi-
vidual whose standards fit the concepts I
have been talking about, seems to me a
challenge worth facing, a challenge that
can carry a man to the full limit of his
capabilities in the business world.
On the other hand, I hasten to add that
I see nothing wrong with becoming a
technician. Technicians are a necessary
part of the industrial manpower situation
and the need for them grows as industry
grows more complex, and more and more
of our day-to-day activities require techni-
cal knowledge. They fulfill an honorable,
dignified calling and without them indus-
try would grind' to a halt by tomorrow
noon. But it is the educated engineer,
rather than the educated technician, who
will marshal the forces of nature to man's
bidding. And as our society grows in-
creasingly more complicated so must the
engineer enlarge his understanding of the
whole aspect of society if his efforts are
to mesh with what is best for our society.
Otherwise we are merely engaged in
clever gadgetry.
Unfortunately, to define an engineer as
I have done does not make every graduate
engineer nor every licensed professional
engineer that type of individual. Quite to
the contrary, a considerable portion of the
men who hold engineering degrees and
professional licenses are, by my definition,
technicians. Furthermore, to have been
elected to Tau Beta Pi gives no assurance
that you will not develop along the same
lines. In fact, in the effort to achieve a
high scholastic standard, it may be that
some of you may have constricted your
viewpoint and thus enhanced the risk of
falling into this class. Whether that even-
tuality is good or bad depends on your
point of view, I suppose. It would be my
opinion that the business world, and so-
ciety in general, has hungry need for men
of technical comprehension who can also
supply a large measure of social aware-
ness—who can deal with the problems
of human relations. And I submit to you
that a great many engineering graduates
fail miserably in this regard.
To become this type of engineer re-
quires effort over and beyond the scholas-
tic effort needed to obtain a college de-
gree. To fill the shoes I have described
requires an educational effort at least
equal to and in many cases exceeding the
notable effort you have been called upon
to make thus far. It will be a continuing
effort as long as you aspire to take the
true engineer's position in modern society.
You are going to find that while the back-
ground knowledge you have acquired to
date will provide you with an excellent
foothold in an engineering career, it will
fall far short of providing the full mo-
mentum needed to carry you very far up
the ladder. In short, you are going to find
that you are no exception to the axiom
that the completely educated man simply
does not exist. In fact, by choosing the
engineering profession, you accept a bur-
den in this respect. We live in an age of
rapid technological change, and the com-
petitive forces of our system compel the
engineer to maintain a current position
with regard to knowledge of his field—
and the fields are rapidly advancing.
The dangers of a narrow approach to
professional competence are not unique
to engineering. They exist in every profes-
sion to some degree, but are, I believe,
more prevalent in the engineering pro-
fession than in any other. It is too easy
for an engineer to become engulfed in a
complexity of Things—to the exclusion
of People. Who ever heard of a doctor or
lawyer who ignored the human equation?
But engineers by the thousand serenely
assume that Things are the end in view—
completely overlooking the fact that a
Thing is worthless in and of itself.
In order to illustrate what I am trying
to say, I would like to digress for a mo-
ment to discuss accounting. Accountants
deal in figures, precise dollar and cent
figures, and they speak a language involv-
ing terms such as, economic depreciation,
fixed charges, etc. It is almost as foreign
to the outsider as our own engineering
jargon. An accountant who becomes pro-
ficient in his field, who is able to under-
stand the other operations of the organi-
zation of which he is a part, and who can
interpret his efforts to the satisfaction of
other departments is a valuable man. Such
men rise to important positions in busi-
ness and have the satisfaction of respon-
sible posts. But the accountant who con-
fines his efforts to accounting techniques,
acts as though his column of figures were
the sole purpose of the organization, and
ignores the fact that to be useful his work
must be understood by others, becomes
merely a highly qualified bookkeeper, a
title no accountant likes to accept. Engi-
neers, by much the same pattern of action,
become technicians.
In the first place, the problem of edu-
cating an engineer is a difficult one. For
some reason, either traditional or other-
wise, the schools of higher learning are
given only four short years to perform
their part of the task. At the same time,
the complexities of engineering technol-
ogy have been growing by leaps and
bounds. There are courses which are al-

FOR REGISTRATION?
by R. C. PORTER, Professor of Mechanical Engineering
Is your wife the common-law kind,
or did you make it legal from the start?
Who cares anyway? Maybe you do. Maybe
it is a matter of pride to you. Maybe your
friends care too. Friends usually do.
In engineering too, one may just "take
up" with the work, or he may court it
more seriously through the channels of a
college education, but it becomes legal
that he is a professional engineer when,
and only when, he has a certificate of
registration. Those who would build a
stronger and more dignified engineering
profession like him better that way.
Professional pride and standing are
among the main forces motivating regis-
tration of the young engineer. The real
objective of a young engineering grad-
uate is a place in a respected profession,
and not merely a job. A profession with-
out a legal basis is weak in court and in
Society. Therefore, every young engineer-
ing graduate should seek to become a
registered part of the legally recognized
profession which he has chosen, and into
which he has invested so much time and
money, as soon as possible after gradua-
tion. Thus he will contribute a greater
share toward the enhancement of his pro-
fession among men of other professions.
How many of the June graduates of the
law schools of the country this year will
fail to take the Bar examination? What
percentage of the graduates of the medi-
cal schools will not take their State Board
examinations? Will anyone have to argue
them into doing so? Will they read an
article along these lines in some journal
and then suddenly decide that they should
be legally qualified? They have never
considered any other course of action. In
your opinion, should the young engineer-
ing graduate be as proud of and as anx-
ious for the advancement of his profes-
sion as any of these? What will you do
about it?
Like the young engineering graduate,
the law school graduate or the medical
school graduate could get a job without
passing the state examination. Of course
he would have no legal standing and his
activities would be limited by what he
could do under the guidance and respon-
sibility of someone who is legally quali-
fied. It would indeed be hard to find a
graduate in either of these fields who
would be willing to settle for so menial
a position.
Why are the professions of law and
medicine so far ahead of engineering in
these respects? It is purely a matter of
evolution. Within the memory of many
persons living today lawyers qualified for
practice without entering college. Men
"read medicine" in the offices of old doc-
tors and then spent a year or so in medi-
cal school. That was the limit of the
training of many of these men who later
went into practice. Who put them where
they are today? It was their own organiza-
tion. Likewise, if the engineers are to
evolute professionally it will be by the
power of their own organization.
When the trade unions attempt to or-
ganize young engineering graduates by
holding out to these innocent and often
unsuspecting young men certain proposed
wage benefits and other fringe benefits
which are generally to be found in union
bargains, it is evident that the union or-
ganizers regard the engineers as non-pro-
fessional. What could be farther from the
objective of a professionally minded
engineer than to give up his claim of a
position in management for membership
in a trade union? This is a serious mat-
ter today, and registration as a profes-
sional engineer legally protects the young
graduate against the forces of union or-
ganizers.
The National Society of Professional
Engineers admits only registered engi-
neers to membership. It is an organiza-
tion which has as its purpose the promo-
tion of the professional, economic, social,
political, and ethical interests of the engi-
neering profession as a whole. Unlike
other major engineering societies which
have technical specialties, the N.S.P.E.
embraces all branches of engineering. It is
to the engineering profession what the
American Medical Association and The
American Bar Association are to their
respective professions. Its membership
totals between thirty and forty thousand.
As an "Engineer in Training" you are
eligible for membership. Will you join
the Engineering Profession, or will you
settle for a job?
New Machine Lays Concrete
Without Use of Road Forms
Concrete paving without road forms
has become a reality with the introduc-
tion of a self-propelled paving machine
that can lay better than 1,000 linear
feet of slab daily, Construction Methods
and Equipment, reports.
Used experimentally on an 18,000-foot
stretch of road in southern Illinois, the
machine required a crew of only 11 men,
as against the 32 to 33 that would have
been needed with ordinary paving meth-
ods, the magazine says.
The rig, adjustable to handle slabs 18
to 26 feet wide and of any normal thick-
ness, travels on a pair of 13-foot crawlers.
Forms 29 feet long extend ahead of the
rig to confine concrete deposited on the
subgrade by a dual-drum mixer. A sur-
face vibrating screed (piece that levels
off the concrete) extends across the ma-
chine; it consists of two 2 x 10 inch
planks set on edge and carrying an elec-
tric vibrator in the center. Reciprocating
transverse screeds are mounted four feet
fore and aft of the vibratory screed.
As the rig advances, the magazine ex-
plains, the mix is struck off by the first
reciprocating screed, consolidated by the
vibratory screed and finished to final grade
by the second reciprocating screed. The
rig is powered by a 140-hp engine.
It is not difficult for the machine to
maintain alignment. Maneuverability of
the crawlers makes it easy for the opera-
tor to match a wire pointer on one form
with a string line staked on the grade.
However, the magazine notes, it is im-
perative to have a smooth stretch of sub-
grade finished to the proper elevation if
the paver is to lay a slab of correct thick-
ness and at the correct grade. On the ex-
perimental piece, the subgrade was pre-
pared by motor graders, whose operators
had to exercise extreme care to obtain
minute accuracy.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


If the Michigan Sailing Club did not already exist, it's a
cinch the University would have to invent it. What sort of a
brochure could be sent to prospective freshmen, dottering
alumni, etc. without a picture of some bright athletic-looking
chap sailing a dinghy on a lake, which, according to the im-
pression one receives from the brochure, must lap gently at
the steps of the General Library. If this impression is not quite
accurate, too much blame should not be given to the Univer-
sity P.R. men; they just get carried away by the glamour of
the thing.
Ever since its organization in 1937, the Sailing Club has
been a lively, highly active group interested in promoting the
glamorous cause of dinghy sailing and in having a good time.
As Doug Stewart, Commodore of the Club, remarked, "We
don't try to compete with some of the eastern schools that have
sailing as a team sport. We just try to give everyone a chance
to sail and enjoy themselves."
The club does all its local sailing at Base Line Lake where
they have a 90 foot, T-shaped dock, and where, by next fall,
they will have a boathouse. Construction on the Club's new
boathouse will begin this summer. The plans include room
for storage of boats, a workshop, a clubhouse (complete with
fireplace), and other assorted facilities.
Since 1937 the club has been purchasing boats, and they
now own a total of 11 dinghys and an 18 foot outboard crash
boat. Ten of these are ll1/^ foot, catboat-rigged, centerboard
dinghys and the eleventh a similar dinghy made of fibreglass.
Their hulls are of the "planing" type, similar in design to the
International 14 and Thistle hulls.
During the Spring and Fall the Michigan Club is host to a
total of four regettas and teams from all over the Midwest
come here to sail. This Spring the Michigan Invitational drew
entries from MSC, U. of D, Wisconsin, and Chicago with the
home team barely edging out MSC to retain their title. In
May, the area eliminations for the Midwest Championship of
the National Collegiate Yacht Racing Association are held
here. In addition, the Sailing Club sends representatives to
Annapolis, Ohio State, Cincinnati, Purdue, Notre Dame, and
other schools where regattas are held. On the basis of per-
formances in these regattas, Michigan ranks as a power by
Midwest standards, but doesn't compare with such schools as
MIT and the Naval Academy.
While things are more quiet during the winter, there are
still a few means for Club members to keep busy. The dinghys
must be put in storage, revarnished, and, if necessary, repaired.
Campus meetings are held where movies are shown, and a
Shore School is run for nautical neophytes. And there is an
occasional informal party.
Preparation for a season of sailing has already begun
when Michigan lakes are still under a foot of ice. Here
a group of summer sailors have turned carpenter and
are sanding hulls in preparation for a new coat of
varnish.
The present membership of the Club is "somewhere around
65 or 70 members." The current officers are: Doug Stewart,
Commodore; Joan Sundquist, Vice-Commodore; Mildred Le-
Gauld, Treasurer; Janet Rearick, Secretary; Dick Hamlin,
Buildings and Grounds; and Eric Tipp, Race Chairman. If
more information about the club is desired, any of these
people would be quite happy to provide it.

A winter warm spell—and sandpaper and varnish are
still much in evidence.
The ice is out, and almost as quickly the hulls are in
the water. Here, masts are being rigged and lines to
handle the sails are being secured.

Preparation for the coming season includes getting
into shape not only the hulls but sails, spars, lines,
brightwork, and . . . rudders.
Not quite the climate one ordinarily associates with
sailing, but weather is no obstacle to a man who has
waited five long months for the ice to break.

Early in 1949 the AEC's Industrial
Advisory group reported on the role of
government in guiding the Industry—
Atomic Energy relationship.1. The stated
aims of this advisory group were these:
(1) To utilize the nation's industrial
research and development capacity along
these lines,
(2) to keep industries informed of
developments in their field,
(3) and to provide technical training
in atomic energy to industrial personnel.
Industrial contact with the AEC is gen-
erally through contacts issued by the Com-
mission. The establishments at Oak Ridge
and Hanford, for example, are operated
by industrial concerns.
Research is done jointly by industry,
private research firms and educational in-
stitutions. For instance, various Universi-
ties operate the Brookhaven, Argonne,
Berkeley and Ames, Iowa laboratories.
These various research centers also pro-
vide radioactive isotopes for a whole
variety of uses including medicine and
agriculture as well as industry.
In fact, in summing up its findings, the
AEC's Industrial Advisory group, in part,
had this to say:
It is not unlikely that (the use of ra-
dioactive materials) in automatic con-
trol of chemical, metallurgical and
other processes will prove to be one of
the most significant industrial values to
come out of atomic energy.
Let us approach the major fields
into which industry may enter in the realm
of atomic energy:
I. Atomic power, and
II. Radioactive isotopes.
Recently, Jerome Luntz, editor of
Nucleonics said that by the end of this
century the world consumption of energy
will reach 100 x 1018 Btu's per century
while world energy reserves, economically
recoverable at substantially present costs,
add up to 30-40 Q (1 Q equals 1018
Btu's).2 This leaves a gap of 60-70 Q to
be filled. Other figures:l quote world coal
supplies alone at somewhat less than
68 Q, oil being 0.4 Q. This leaves a defi-
cit of only about 40 Q. The 28-58 Q
remaining has several possible sources.
If breeder-reactors are used (i.e., reac-
tors that create fissionable Uranium from
ordinary Uranium as well as produce
power) then this gap may easily be filled.
Also on the drawing boards are exten-
sions of hydroelectric power and the
newer field of solar energy which prom-
ises an even vaster, more fundamental
source of power. In any event, we are in
little danger of running out of power.
Late in 1950 certain information on
low power reactors was "declassified"
(and thus made available to industrial
and other research laboratories) that made
it possible to build these reactors.4 The
big holdup up to this time was the ques-
tion of whether seeking security through
secrecy interferes with security through
achievement. Eventually the irrationality
of the notion that one nation or group can
have a corner on the facts of nature be-
came too evident to ignore. The informa-
tion had to be released.
Only recently did the University of
Michigan acquire a grant from the Ford
Foundation for the construction of such
a reactor. When it is completed in two
years it will be one of the largest yet al-
lowed by the AEC.
It is important to understand the two
principle methods of producing power
from atomic energy before any compari-
son is made with other sources of power.
The first of these is the single-purpose
reactor which produces power only. Fis-
sion products are considered wastes after
the fission reaction has given up its heat.
In the dual-purpose reactor, Plutonium is
co-produced with power and is sold to the
government and others to pay for fuel
costs.
Let us then, set up a hypothetical power
plant and consider the costs involved and
in general, the economics involved in
operating such a power plant.

Since ordinary Uranium, irradiated (to
initiate a chain reaction), the fuel of a
single purpose reactor, is basically cheap,
the decision to produce power at 0.1th
the fuel cost of coal is an easy one. How-
ever, it is wise to make a comparative
study of power costs from various
sources. (See following figures.)
Although the operating costs are low-
est for the dual purpose reactor, the capi-
tal costs are spread over a very short range
of time in relation to the others and this
has its equalizing effect.

Fresh out of school, Bob Wilson, '53, wa9 put to
work on a Transistor project at Bell Laboratories.
He explains why he never had time to be awed.

Xn some ways it was hard to believe.
I had received my B.E.E. at the University of Dela-
ware in June, 1953, and a week later I was working
in the world-famous Bell Laboratories.
"But I didn't have time to be awed because
they put me right to work. They gave me responsi-
bility fast.
"My group was working on the experimental
application of transistors to carrier systems. My
assignment was the electrical design of a variolosser
for the compressor and for the expandor to be lo-
cated in the terminals.
"The supervision I received and the equipment
I had were tops. I quickly discovered that I had to
rely on my ingenuity as much as on the college
courses I had taken. Perhaps that's one reason for
the great new discoveries continually turned out by
the Labs.
"Now I'm in the Communication Development
Training Program, continuing my technical educa-
tion and learning what all the Laboratories sections
do and how their work is integrated.
"In a year I'll be back working with the group
with which I started."
Assuming responsibility fast is a common experi-
ence among the engineering, physical science, arts
and social science, and business administration
graduates who join the Bell System. Bob Wilson
went with Bell Laboratories. There also are job
opportunities with the operating telephone com-
panies, Western Electric and Sandia Corporation.

At present, several groups are doing
joint research to develop atomic power
on a competitive basis.
Each of these groups is quite exten-
sive. The Dow-Detroit Edison group for
instance, now includes 18 electric power
systems, 4 manufacturing industries, 1
chemical company and 3 engineering and
construction organizations representing a
total investment of $8 billion."
So much for the individual firm; the
tabel at the bottom of the page shows the
picture on an industry-wide basis.
In the production of power, radioac-
tive isotopes are a joint product. To put
Atomic Power on a paying basis, these
isotopes, present in the reactor "ashes,"
must be recovered and marketed. Thus,
uses of isotopes—extraneous to the atomic
power industry itself—will directly in-
fluence plant location and waste recovery
programs.
An explanation of how these isotopes
are used in other fields is now in order.
The first to be considered is the medical
application of radioactive Iodine and
Phosphorus. Then the uses in agriculture
are taken up. And finally the phases of
industrial use are explored.
II
The first applications " of radioactive
Iodine began in the late 1930's when Dr.
Hertz and his associates in Boston pre-
pared the radio-I by exposure of ethyl
iodide to a Radium-Beryllium mixture.
The activated I was injected into rabbits
whose organs were later examined for
their concentration of radio-I. It was
found that when normal, the thyroid
glands in the neck picked up about 80
times as much I as other tissue and dur-
ing cases of overactivity of the thyroid, a
level of several hundred times that of

normal tissue was reached. Eventually the
I was irradiated in the cyclotron to pro-
duce the radioactive variety. With this in-
creased supply it was possible to solve
such problems as the absorption-time
curves and the absolute amount of I per
unit of tissue. A good deal of very com-
plex work was involved. When the ab-
solute amount I/unit of tissue was deter-
mined, studies could begin on man.
The earliest set of reports was made by
Hamilton and Soley of the University of
California. They reported on twenty-two
patients in 1939, all with overactive
thyroids. They made an important obser-
vation, later confirmed by Hertz, that the
radio-I actually goes to form the toxic
material made by the gland. In other
words, the I takes part in the natural
metabolic processes of this important or-
gan; this fact is a notable contribution to
our knowledge.
At the same time it was found that
Cancer could be controlled in this gland
by the radio-I. Thus this radioactive iso-
tope can be used both to control thyroid
activity as well as cure cancerous growth
there. This is a very important advance.
Early in the work on isotopes, Dr. John
Lawrence of the University of California
began to explore the possibility that
Phosphorous could be used to measure
the rate of growth or the rate of chemical
turnover in normal and cancer cells. This
was thought possible because Phosphorous
is an active participant in the metabolic-
processes.
In the fight against Leukemia, a cancer
of the blood-forming tissues, it was found
that the lymph glands will absorb a pro-
proportionately greater amount of the
phosphorous (or radio-P) than normal
tissue. These glands are frequently a site
of the disease as are the spleen and the
bone marrow. Radio-P goes to all of them.
This treatment of cancer is simpler,
cheaper and just as effective as X-ray ap-
plications to infected regions.
This fundamental work cannot be over-
looked, there is a tremendous amount of
work to be done in the study of basic
biochemistry by the use of such "tracer"
elements (certain instruments can detect
radio-elements anywhere in the body with-
out any surgery whatsoever). I feel there
has been far too much emphasis on the
direct therapeutic application of the iso-
topes now in existence and far too little
emphasis on the enormous developments

Undoubtedly you will recognize
this application of a familiar tech-
nique for studying stresses. In this
case, it was used to develop gears
that are less than 5 inches in
diameter yet easily transmit over
1000 horsepower.
Inherently, the design and de-
velopment of aircraft engines offers
unusual opportunities for applying
basic engineering principles
learned in school. In few other
places can a technical graduate
utilize his education and abilities
more fully — gain recognition and
advancement.
Many of our engineers who had
important roles in developing the
most powerful jet engine known to
be in production — rated in the
10,000-pound thrust class — are
still in their twenties.
To those young graduates who
can see the career possibilities in
the rapidly evolving field of air-
craft propulsion, we can offer a
real opportunity for growth and
professional development.

New Method of Producing
Transformer Coils
A continuous roll of thin metal foil
and a sheet of insulating paper, rolled
together, form the heart of a new, high-
speed, automatic technique for the manu-
facture of transformer coils, it was re-
vealed here today by engineers of Syl-
vania Electric Products Inc.
The new development not only can sub-
stantially reduce manufacturing costs but
would eliminate a potential bottleneck in
electronic equipment production during a
national emergency, according to E. Fin-
ley Carter, Sylvania Vice President and
Technical Director, who is attending a
symposium on the "Automatic Produc-
tion of Electronic Equipment," spon-
sored by the United States Air Force and
the Stanford Research Institute.

A conventional coil winding machine
on which a few transformer coils can
be made at one time.
Pointing out that for more than 60
years the production of transformer coils
has been a comparatively slow process in-
volving a great deal of meticulous hand
labor, Mr. Carter stated that the new
process was developed by Sylvania engi-
neers in response to a request from the
Air Force to seek faster production meth-
ods capable of rapid expansion in cases of
national emergency.
The traditional method of producing
transformer coils involves the winding of
copper wire on cardboard cores. The new
Compiled by DICK SCHREIBER
concept, as developed by Sylvania at
Lighting Division laboratories in Ipswich,
Mass., is based on stacks of wafer coils
which resemble miniature life preservers.
The coils are made by rolling together
wide sheets of very thin metal and simi-
larly thin sheets of insulating paper. The
roll is then sliced—as bread is sliced.
Each of these slices, or wafers, can form
the key element of an ordinary trans-
former and, in some cases—for radio and
television frequencies—may actually be
the complete transformer.
Courtesy: Sylvania Electric Products
A roll of metal foil and insulating
paper is sliced quickly into coils of
any desired width and the wafers
are ready for immediate use in trans-
former production
Details of the technique were revealed
in a technical paper prepared for the sym-
posium by three Sylvania engineers: Theo-
dore Wroblewski, supervisor of trans-
former engineering; Albert Zack, project
supervisor; and Wilson H. Hannahs. Ac-
cording to the engineers, this new method
"combines important key advantages for
automatic production and greater flexibil-
ity in the design of electric equipment."
The new wafer coils, they predicted, will
permit significant future changes in the
long established art of making transform-
ers.
Development of the new technique
came about under a contract between Syl-
vania and the Electronics Components
Laboratory at the Wright Air Develop-
ment Center. The goal of the Air Force,
according to the Sylvania engineers, was
"maximum production with minimum
labor and equipment in times of national
emergency." "We believe that this goal
has been brought within reach by our new-
production technique," they declared, and
pointed out that with guided missiles,
aircraft, ground warning systems, proxim-
ity fuses, and similar material based on
electronics control, it is important that ex-
panded production be possible with no
foreseeable bottlenecks.
Other potential benefits which may be
derived from the new technique, it was
noted, were the certainty of greater uni-
formity and, hence, higher quality; more
flexible design through simplicity, a
broader approach to material usage, and
new shape concepts; and the possibilities
of use in other fields heretofore limited
by standard techniques.
The engineers pointed out that while
the Air Force was continuing its broad
examination of the potentialities of this
new production method in the military
field that Sylvania is now investigating
possible application in nonmilitary fields.
Design Suggestion Given
for H-Blast Fringe Areas
Structural strength and blast resistance
of buildings constructed in H-bomb
explosion fringe areas can be increased
as much as 100 per cent at an added cost
of only five-to-ten per cent, according to
Engineering News-Record.
This statement is based on an exclusive
interview with Arsham Amirikian, chief
designing engineer of the Bureau of
Yards and Docks, U.S. Navy. Applying
his experience with structures that have
been subjected to A-bomb tests, Mr.
Amirikian has developed several rules that
engineers can put to use immediately, the
magazine reports.
Buildings should be planned to con-
form to a rectangular layout, with the
width equal to at least one-third of the
length, according to Mr. Amirikian. If
a greater ratio of length to width is neces-
sary, transverse shear walls should be in-
stalled at intervals not greater than three
times the width of the building.
Main framing should be rigid or con-
tinuous, and to provide direct support to
secondary framing, maximum spacing of

Compatible color television will eventually reach every TV home
The rainbow you can see in black and white!
RCA brings you compatible color TV.
Lett you see color programs in black
and white on the set you now own!
"When a modern and practical color tel-
evision system for the home is here, RCA
will have it..."
Echoing down through the years, these
words—spoken in 1946 by David Samoff,
Chairman of the Board of RCA—have a
ring of triumph today.
Behind this great development are
long years of scientific research, hard
work and financial risk. RCA scientists
were engaged in research basically re-
lated to color television as far back as the
1920's ... even before black-and-white
television service was introduced.
Since then RCA has spent over
$25,000,000 to add the reality of color to
black-and-white TV, including develop-
ment of the tri-color tube.
The fruit of this great investment is the
RCA all-electronic compatible color tel-
evision system, a system that provides for
the telecasting of high-quality color pic-
tures that can be received in full color on
color receivers; and in black and white
on the set you now own.
RCA and NBC will invest an addi-
tional $15,000,000 during color TV's.
"Introductory Year"-1954-to establish
this new service on a solid foundation.
ROV color sets are beginning to come
off the production lines in small quanti-
ties. Although it will probably be another
year before mass production is reached,
the promise of compatible color televi-
sion is being fulfilled.
RCA pioneered and developed compatible
color television

more than 25 feet. Framing should con-
sist of either reinforced concrete or struc-
tural steel, and joints should be designed
with moment- and shear-resisting capaci-
ties.
Floor slabs should be integrated with
beams or stringers (supports). In precast
concrete construction, floor slabs should
be cast with the stringers to form integral
panels. Such panels should be securely
anchored to each other and to the main
frames by means of metal inserts cast in
the elements and welded together in the
final assembly work, the magazine says.
Where ceiling framing is required, it
should be directly connected to the floor
or roof framing. Use of suspended ceil-
ings and loosely fastened ceiling blocks
should be avoided.
Roof framing, according to the article,
may consist of a poured concrete slab or
precast panel. The concrete slab should be
poured monolithically with the support-
ing concrete members, or secured effec-
tively to supporting steel members, and
should be designed for full continuity
over the supports.
Exterior walls should be of moment-
and shear-resistant framing or panels—
eliminating the use of unreinforced brick
or block construction. For interior walls,
preference should be given to relatively
rigid type framing construction over ma-
sonry. Since windows weaken the strength
of wall framing, and glass constitutes a
serious hazard under blast forces, open-
ings should be eliminated or minimized.
The preferable place for exterior doors
is in the longitudinal walls. All exterior
walls and interior shear walls should be
securely connected to the foundations to
resist uplift and overturning, the maga-
zine concludes.
U-M Tell Plans for Observing
Soo Locks Centennial
Details on the University of Michigan's
plans to assist in the 1955 celebration of
the centennial of the opening of the locks
at Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., have been an-
nounced by Erich A. Walter, assistant to
the president and chairman of the Uni-
versity's Soo Locks Centennial Committee.
The University will cooperate in the
centennial at an educational level by
preparing and making available for dis-
tribution an illustrated brochure, a motion
picture film, and a series of radio and
television programs.
IN THE NEWS
(Continued from page 24)
Inquiries regarding the availability of
any of this material should be directed to
Mr. Walter, Assistant to the President,
University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.
Scheduled for publication by August of
this year is a 35 to 40 page illustrated
brochure written by F. Clever Bald, assis-
tant director of the Michigan Historical
Collection and lecturer in history. This
will contain some 10,000 words of text
and several pictures and maps describing
the early history of the area around Sault
Ste. Marie, the construction of the locks,
and their economic importance to the
United States. University President Harlan
Hatcher will write the foreword.
The Audio-Visual Education Center,
under the direction of Ford Lemler, is
already at work preparing a motion pic-
ture which will use as its theme the
"world's greatest inland waterway," the
Great Lakes. The U. S. Coast Guard and
the Army's Corps of Engineers are co-
operating in the filming of the scenes in-
volving the locks. The movie is scheduled
for completion by December, so that it
will be available for showing early in the
centennial year of 1955.
At least 13, and possibly 14, radio
shows are being prepared by William
Bender of the University's Broadcasting
Service for use in the "Radio Classroom"
series beginning in January. The programs
will be put on tape for rebroadcast over
radio stations throughout the state. While
aimed particularly at school classrooms,
these radio programs would be of inter-
est to the entire population of the state.
During the spring of 1955, the locks
and their importance to Michigan also
will be highlighted in the television pro-
grams presented by the University on
Sunday afternoons over WWJ-TV De-
troit. Seven or eight half-hour shows are
planned by Garnet Garrison, director of
television, in which not only the Soo
area but also the northern half of the
Lower Peninsula and the remainder of the
Upper Peninsula will be featured.
In addition, an exhibit featuring the
work of the University's Department of
Marine Engineering and Naval Architec-
ture, which has made important contribu-
tions to the hull designs and propulsion
systems of the big freighters that ply the
Great Lakes, will be placed on display
in the "Vacationland," a state ferry which
links the two peninsulas of Michigan. The
exhibit will be prepared by Prof. Louis A.
Baier, department chairman.
Other members of the committee, be-
sides those already mentioned, are Profs.
Kenneth McMurry and Charles M. Davis
of the Department of Geography. In ad-
dition to the information about the geo-
graphical importance of the locks which
they have contributed to the committee,
Professor Davis also has been helpful in
arranging for the cooperation of the U. S.
Coast Guard, the Army Engineers and the
Air Force.
The rest of the committee includes:
Associate Prof. John C. Kohl, director of
the Transportation Institute; Prof. Ivan
H. Walton of the engineering college's
Department of English, who is an author-
ity on the songs which have been sung by
sailors of the lakes; Michael Church of
the Extension Service; Arthur L. Bran-
don, director of University relations; and
Cleland B. Wyllie, editor of the Informa-
tion and News Service.

The metal that thrives on punishment
Steel serves you better when manganese is added
—because the harder it works, the tougher it gets
Ever watch a power shovel bite into earth and rock?
And wonder how the teeth of the steel bucket can en-
dure such punishment? The amazing answer is that the
teeth not only endure such treatment—they actually
get harder because of it!
MANGANESE HOLDS THE SECRET-The story behind
this remarkable steel is the unusual metal called man-
ganese. The hundreds of thousands of tons of manganese
required each year by steel and other metal-making
industries are obtained by refining huge quantities of
ore that come from mines in widely scattered points
across the face of the globe.
ADDED TO STEEL —All steel contains manganese. A
small amount "cleanses" molten steel and removes
impurities. A larger amount of manganese makes the
steel tougher and stronger.
FROM ORE TO ALLOY—Transforming raw ores into
a variety of manganese alloys for the metal-producing
industries is one of the many important jobs of the
people of Union Carbide.

worthy of notice.
Anti-Corrosion Current
A preservative process involving elec-
trolysis is being used to reduce corrosion
on reserve vessels anchored in salt water,
according to Product Engineering. Recti-
fiers set up a direct current voltage be-
tween the submerged portion of the ship

The process is estimated to be saving the

• "Worthington was my choice," Mr. Berger says, "be-
cause of the excellent training and the unusual experiences
that are possible with a manufacturer having a worldwide
reputation, and worldwide distribution. Then, when a
company has seventeen divisions, including air condition-
ing, refrigeration, turbines, Diesel engines, compressors
and pumps of all kinds, construction machinery, and
power transmission equipment, a graduate engineer's
chances for getting into his chosen field are even better.
"Supporting these divisions are research, engineering,
production, purchasing, and sales, domestic and export.
The real opportunity, however, is in Worthington itself.
This is a company that is growing, just as it has for more
than a century. It is always looking for new, related
products and good men to engineer, produce, and sell
them—at home and abroad.
"I began my career with Worthington's training pro-
gram in the Research and Development Laboratory, where
full-scale equipment is designed, tested and improved.
This experience gave me an understanding of the tremen-
dous part the company plays in the everyday life of mil-
lions of people. Within fourteen months I was sent to
Mexico to inspect the facilities of our distributors there.
"The opportunities for first-hand laboratory experience,
sales training and contact, travel and field trips, among
many others, make Worthington a first-rate company for
the young engineer with a desire to learn and progress in
his work."
When you're thinking of a good job, think high—think

inspecting portions of very large parts.
Company officials stated that the new
unit has been built in response to many
requests for a 30-inch model incorporat-
ing the same optical refinements first in-
troduced in Kodak's 14-inch projectors.
These features include a choice of either
shadow or surface illumination at the
flick of a switch; ordinary room-light
operation; instant changes in magnifica-
tion without refocusing; and unvarying 8-
inch distance between the lens and the
plane of the object under observation.
In addition the new model offers a
staging area with a 17-inch throat; eight-
inch horizontal and eight-inch vertical
table travel; a built-in helix table with a
worktable rotation of 15° off center in
either direction for setting helix angles;
horizontal and vertical micrometers which
are guaranteed to .00005" over their
entire 1-inch range; a direct reading
screen for angular measurements which
can be read without vernier from a preci-
sion engraved dial calibrated to 2' of
arc; and a built-in 1,500-watt light source
for the surface inspection of cavities,
blind holes, and surface details with the
Kodak Normal Surface Illuminator.
Illumination for shadow projection is
provided by a 5 00-watt light source which
gives a sharp, easy-to-read, screen image
across the full 30-inch diameter.
The projector is available with a choice
of six interchangeable lenses—lOx, 20x,
i\y4x, 50x, 6iy2x, and lOOx, any of
which may be mounted in a motorized
turret to provide instant change of mag-
nification. No focusing or other adjust-
ment is necessary when magnification is
changed.
In design of the new unit, projection
lenses and mirrors are both mounted on a
single member. This provides maximum
rigidity and alignment for these critical
parts even under rigorous shop condi-
tions.

The inductor alternator type exciter in
the new system is under the control of
magnetic amplifiers through a circuit sen-
sitive to the main generator terminal volt-
age. Selenium rectifiers convert the high
frequency output of the inductor alterna-
tor to direct current for exciting the main
generator field and the exciter series field.
The inductor generator has inherently
high reactance and is especially sensitive
to lagging-power-factor loads. The con-
trol signal to the magnetic amplifier is ob-
tained from potential transformers on the
main generator terminals through a com-
parator circuit and a magnetic pre-ampli-
fier. Output of the main generator is con-
trolled with a high degree of amplification
by using the magnetic amplifier as a
variable-reactance load.
Because the exciter has in effect no
time constant of its own, the speed of re-
sponse as a factor delaying restoration of
voltage is governed mainly by the very

The senior class officers of the Engineering Class of 1954
have undertaken a project which we feel will be of consider-
able benefit to all engineering students. We have asked a num-
ber of Michigan's most successful and representative alumni
for their opinions on some questions of interest to students pre-
paring for an engineering career. These alumni, many of whom
are presidents and directors of outstanding companies and
laboratories, have been most kind in submitting their views.
The purpose of this article is to present the questions which
were sent to our alumni for consideration with a summary of
their replies. It is thought that with this information, we, as
engineering students, may plan our programs more effectively
and choose electives more wisely, if we are to prepare our-
selves for roles as successful engineers. The questions, with
the corresponding replies, will be presented below.
1. What is your evaluation of the Engineering College
program in which you participated, i.e., its academic merits,
suggested changes, and ideas for broadening its academic
subject matter?
The majority of the alumni indicated that the curriculum
was well thought out and well balanced at the time of their
attendance at Michigan. However, there are many strong sug-
gestions to add more public speaking and English courses.
"The number of engineers who can't write a good report is
exceeded only by those who can't write a good letter, and this
in turn is exceeded only by those who can't talk to a group of
people other than their close associates." This quotation from
one of the replies is a good illustration of how badly these
courses are needed. After all, what good are an engineer's find-
ings, if he cannot put them across?
2. What is your opinion concerning the value of extra-
curricular activities to the engineering student?
It was felt by almost all of the alumni that extracurricular
activities are very beneficial to the engineering student and well
worth the time required. However, these activities should not
be carried to the point where comparatively little attention is
given to academic accomplishments. The following quotations
have been taken from the replies of the alumni. "In pursuing
an engineering education one deals almost exclusively in in-
animate objects and concepts, and the student needs the con-
tacts from extra-curricular activities to keep reminding him
that the world is filled with people, each of whom has his own
personality, privileges, and desires." "Such activities give one
greater opportunities for learning how to get along with
others, which is basic to success after graduation." "I would
place them [extra-curricular activities] in the same order of
value as academic work itself." "I am sure that as we select
new college graduates that a considerable mount of attention is
given to extra-curricular activities."
3. Are you in favor of the concept of a pre-enginering
liberal arts curriculum, i.e., a well integrated, common liberal
arts-technical education?
It is the majority opinion that a pre-engineering liberal arts
curriculum is not desirable. The biggest objection raised is
that additional time would be required. Many of the alumni
thought it desirable to augment the present curriculum with
more liberal arts, however, not to the point where several more
years of schooling is required. If the present curriculum were
to be expanded somewhat, perhaps to a five year program, the
recommended courses which should be added are psychology,
more English, speech, business administration, and law.
4. What is your forecast for employment opportunities
for graduating engineers? How does the present high rate
of pay for young engineers affect the older engineers in
industry?
It is the contention of the alumni that opportunities for
graduating engineers are excellent and shall continue to be so
for a long time to come. Not only is the great industrialization
of our country necessitating the employment of more engi-
neers, but also the ratio of engineers to total employees is
increasing steadily. In addition, the engineering field has
broadened so as to include management and administrative
functions as well as pure engineering, which also creates a
further market for engineers.
The present high rate of pay does not seriously affect the
morale of the older engineers. The capable older engineers are
also being paid a high rate of pay. Thus in effect, the engi-
neering profession is earning a higher rate of pay.
5. When compared with men from other schools, how do
engineering graduates from the University of Michigan rank
in educational background, quality of performance, and rela-
tive ease of advancement?
It is felt that Michigan engineering graduates are generally
held in high regard and compare quite favorably with grad-
uates from any other school. A typical Michigan engineer's
performance is at least equal to, and in many cases superior to
the performance of most graduates from other schools. After
a few years a man's school is forgotten and his advancement is
based purely upon his results. Past training has a great influ-
ence, but the individual personality is a most important factor
in an engineer's advancement.
6. Wht is the trend of industry in regard to its recogni-
tion of an Industrial Engineer's degree? Is there a growing
tendency to discredit the industrial program as a technical
education?
The alumni that employ or have contact with industrial
engineers, believe that there is a place for these engineers in
the operational and managerial side of industry. Though this
education is not considered highly technical in nature, the pro-
gram is accepted by industry in general, as sufficient for the
type of work performed.

7. What Is the Importance and value of a graduate
studies degree in engineering today? Would you encourage
students to put off entering the field for an extra year in
order to do graduate work?
The alumni indicated that the importance and value of
graduate studies depends, by and large, upon the type of work
into which an individual engineer is planning to go. If an
engineer is to devote his effort toward research and perhaps
development, a graduate degree is very beneficial. However, if
management, sales, or production work is desired, the year of
industrial experience will be more beneficial, in most cases,
than the year of graduate studies. The original increase in
salary that an engineer receives for having a graduate degree,
in most cases, compensates for what he would be earning if his
time had been devoted to industrial work rather than gradu-
ate studies.
The senior class officers of the Engineering Class of 1954
hope that this project has accomplished its purpose, namely,
that we have helped the undergraduate engineering student to
more effectvely plan their academic and extra-curricular activi-
ties here at Michigan.
Skating Rink
Dartmouth College ice hockey games, practice sessions, no
longer need be cancelled because of warm weather. The
Davis Rink now is artificially frozen; bulk of rink-embedded
refrigeration coil system is more than 10 miles of extra-
heavy steep pipe (1") carrying brine recirculated under auto-
matic control from engine room housing ammounia compres-
sors, shell-and-tube type cooler. Coach Jeremiah says goal no
longer is "artificial skaters on natural ice" "but" natural skat-
ers on artificial ice."
"Operation Oxygen"
Imperial Oil, Ltd., with more than 20 million rugged acres
of Alberta under lease or reservation, now employs its own
"airlift" to provide oxygen-breathing apparatus and automatic
artificial respiration equipment to scattered drilling, explora-
tion, production crews, and to forest firefighters, in emer-
gencies. The artificial respiration equipment is self-contained,
portable MSA "Pneolators." The oxygen-breathing apparatus,
also developed by Mine Safety Appliances Company, is
"Chemox" apparatus which generates its own oxygen (by
chemical reaction with exhaled breath) so wearer is indepen-
dent of toxic atmosphere or oxygen-deficient air. This also
saves hauling oxygen.
Licking Severe Corrosion
American Cyanamid Company engineers at Linden (N.J.)
plant used new type coated cooling section developed by Na-
tional Radiator Company, ohnstown, Pa., to lick unusually
severe corrosion problems in cooling equipment for 98fr
sulfuric acid. Up to 5500 gpm. of raw salt water is used for
acid cooling; corrosion threat was compounded by elevated
temperatures (as high as 225°F.) of entering sulfuric acid.
Specially developed "Kolmetal" coating—85% aluminum
powder in plastic vehicle—applied to cooling sections imme-
diately after sections are cast, proved superior in more than a
year's trial.

Ever Study
TERRESTRIAL ENGINEERING?
Probably not. As far as we know, there isn't such a term.
Even so, the terrain of a manufacturing plant may have
a vital effect on the design and location of its engineer-
ing equipment.
It certainly did in the case of our Belle, West Virginia,
plant, which is just across the road from a flat-topped
hill, 750 feet high.
Perhaps you'd like to match wits with Du Pont engi-
neers, for we feel that this problem was interesting—
and its solution ingenious.
Briefly, the situation was this: Carbon dioxide was to
be removed from a mixture of gases by bringing them
into contact with water in "scrubbers" operating at 450
psi (gauge). The inlet gases contained about 25% CO2
by volume. Because of its greater solubility, most of the
CO2 would leave the scrubbers dissolved in the water.
It was necessary to reduce the pressure of this water
to atmospheric and recover the dissolved carbon dioxide,
since CO2 was needed for use in a chemical synthesis.
The de-gasified water then had to be pumped back into
the pressure scrubbers, to repeat the scrubbing cycle.
Still like to match wits? How would you design an
economical closed system for this scrubbing water? After
you've thought out your solution, you might like to
compare it with the one given below.
Du Pont engineers made use of the precipitous ter-
rain in this way: pressure on the water leaving the
scrubbers was sufficient to force it up to the top of the
hill for CO2 recovery. The returning water thereby pro-
vided a pressure of approximately 325 psi (750 feet of
head) at the base of the hill. This gift of pressure on the
suction side of the water pumps resulted in considerable
energy saving.
Do unusual problems such as this one challenge you
and stir your enthusiasm? If they do, we think you'll be
interested in technical work with the Du Pont Company.

about 15 minutes with a probable error
of only plus or minus 0.12 parts per
million.
The improved method is applicable to
the analysis of multicomponent mixtures
when all gases in the mixture except one
have nearly the same thermal conduc-
tivity. Fortunately, the mixture of hydro-
gen and carbon monoxide evolved by the
tin-fusion analysis falls into this classifi-
cation. The thermal conductivity of
nitrogen and carbon monoxide are prac-
tically equal, while that of hydrogen is
approximately seven times that of the
other two gases. Thus, the thermal con-
ductivity of the mixture at known tem-
perature and pressure can be related di-
rectly to the percentage of hydrogen by
suitable calibration.
Absorbed hydrogen has an embrit-
tling effect on steel without increasing the
tensile strength, even when present in
such minute quantities as 3 parts per
million.
The apparatus for detection and meas-
urement of hydrogen consists of a closed
system of glass tubes with mercury cut-
offs to control the gas flow, an induction
furnace, two mercury diffusion pumps, a
McLeod gage, a conductivity cell and a
'/2-horsepower mechanical vacuum pump
to extract air from the system. Measure-
ments of conductivity are dependent on a
precision ammeter with a range of 0 to
1.00 amperes which, with the conductivity
cell, is tied into an electrical thermal con-
ductivity bridge activated by four iy2-
volt dry cells.
A steel sample to be tested is placed in
the previously evacuated induction furnace
and is fused with pure tin. Mercury vapor
in the diffusion pumps forces the gases
from the furnace into a tube from which
they escape into a chamber of known
volume. They are then conducted into a
McLeod gage by which the pressure of
the gases is measured. To eliminate strati-
fication, the gases next pass through a
mixing chamber.
From the mixing chamber the gases
enter the thermal conductivity cell. The
bottom section of the cell is made of
pyrex tubing with a closed bottom and a
ground joint on the top. A thin piece of
pure platinum wire is suspended in the
center of the cell from nickel wire sup-
ports. The wire is held taut by a small
tungsten spring. The nickel supports are
welded to the tungsten rods used to con-

duct the current into the cell through a
glass-metal seal. Electrical leads from the
modified Wheatstone bridge circuit are
attached to the tungsten rods. The entire
cell up to the glass tube lead-in main-
tained at 0 degrees Centigrade by im-
mersion in an ice and water bath.
The current is turned on and the
bridge circuit is balanced with the plati-
num wire held at a temperature of 25 de-
grees Centigrade. The ammeter reading,
indicating the amperes necessary to hold
that temperature, is a measure of the ther-
mal conductivity of the gas mixture in the
cell. This reading is then compared to a
calibration previously prepared by using
gas mixtures containing various known
percentages of hydrogen from 100 per
cent to 0 per cent. The comparison gives
an accurate analysis of the hydrogen pres-
ent in the mixture.
The over-all precision of analysis by
the thermal conductivity method was
evaluated by the use of duplicate samples.
Each of 10 samples was cut in half to
provide 10 sets of duplicates. A statistical
study of the data obtained from these 10
pairs shows the standard deviation of the
error of observation to be plus or minus
0.17 parts per million, with the probable
error plus or minus 0.12 parts per mil-
lion. Using the statistical criterion of three
standard deviations, a maximum error of
0.5 parts per million is possible, although
the frequency of such an error will be ex-
tremely low.
A Time-Proportional Electronic
Thermostat
A versatile electronic thermostat is now
in use at the National Bureau of Stand-
ards as a general-purpose temperature
controller for a variety of applications.
Developed by F. A. Ransom of the NBS
electronic instrumentation laboratory, the
instrument is designed for flexibility, high
sensitivity, and provides precision tem-
perature control over a wide range of
temperature and power requirements.
The device features such advantages as
(1) no appreciable dead zone; (2) the
sensitivity may be raised very high with-
out objectionable loss of stability, re-
ducing the deviation from the control
point to a minimum with any load
changes; (3)capability of handling power
requirements ranging from milliwatts to
kilowatts for control; (4) the use of
sensing elements which may be a resis-
tance thermometer or a thermistor con-
nected in a bridge circuit, or a thermo-
couple connected to a chopper circuit; and
(5) the use of standard commercial com-
ponents. The thermostat utilizes a prin-
ciple originally described by M. Gouy;
the power supplied to the heating element
is switched on and off in a regular cycle,
but the fraction of the cycle during which
the power remains on is proportional to
the deviation from the desired tempera-
ture.
The temperature sensing element—
usually a resistance thermometer or
thermistor—is connected in one arm of an
alternating-current bridge. The adjacent
arm of the bridge is a variable resistor ad-
justable to the desired temperature con-
trol point. A 164-cps oscillator energizes
the bridge and also supplies synchroniz-
ing voltage to a twin-diode synchronous
detector. When the actual temperature at
the sensing element deviates from the
control temperature, the resulting bridge
error signal is amplified and applied to
the center leg of the synchronous detec-
tor. The resulting current in the center
leg is determined by the amplitude and
phase of the error voltage, being zero
when the error voltage is zero.
Also applied to the detector, in series
with the error voltage, is a voltage from
a sawtooth oscillator. The result is that
the output of the detector consists of a
sawtooth voltage that operates about a
reference level which varies with the
error voltage. This detector output is ap-
plied to a Schmitt trigger circuit, which in
turn actuates a relay that switches the
power applied to the control heater.
With this arrangement the sawtooth
voltage applied to the detector can be
adjusted so that, when the temperature
deviation and thus the error voltage are
zero, the control relay applies power to
the heater 50 percent of the time. Any
temperature deviation from the control
point then alters the proportion of the
"duty cycle" during which power is ap-
plied to the heater; this proportion varies
above or below 50 per cent depending on
the magnitude and direction of the tem-
perature deviation. Large temperature de-
viations, beyond the proportional control
range for which the instrument is set, re-
sults in the heater power being either on
or off continuously—depending on the
direction of the deviation—until the tem-
perature is again brought within the pro-
portional range. The duty cycle, deter-

• Cort Kegley received his Masters Degree in
Physics from Connecticut Wesleyan in 1951.
When the above picture was taken he had
been on the job less than a month, and was one
of a group of young graduates then in training
at Allison.
Much of the experimental and test equipment
at Allison is entirely different from any other.
And, Cort—like other new engineers on the job
—must first learn about these various facilities
which he will be using in instrumentation and
testing.
He is pictured here getting acquainted, so to
speak, with some of the equipment used in
vibration and shock qualification testing. One
of the many electronic accessory units used with
the Allison jet engines is here undergoing a
"shake test" on the large MB vibration exciter
shown in the foreground.
A turbo-propeller governor is bolted to the
shake table of the exciter, which is controlled
from the panel at the left, to determine if simu-
lated engine vibration will cause the unit to
malfunction. The large MB exciter has the ca-
pacity to exert a vibratory force of 2 500 pounds,
with a frequency range up to 500 CPS. A smaller
MB exciter, shown on the bench in the back-
ground, is rated at 50 pounds peak force avail-
able to 2000 CPS.

most a necessity in today's curriculum
that were not even taught in my day, and
I am not exactly an old man. There is
less and less time for nontechnical sub-
jects that would serve to broaden the in-
dividual and temper the concentration on
scientific matters. If it were not for the
varied social and cultural interests of to-
day's campus life, I am afraid the engi-
neering graduates would be a highly con-
centrated, introverted product. And too
many of them are. The proper amount of
participation in the normal activities of
college or university campus life is as im-
portant as is the amount of water added
to a concrete mix. Carried to extremes
either way, the result is unsatisfactory.
Piled on top of the educational prob-
lem, is the tendency toward specialization
in industry and failure on the part of in-
dustry to properly apply existing engi-
neering talent.
There is, I believe, an effort being made
in engineering educational circles to jug-
gle and squeeze the curriculum so that
courses in the humanities and other as-
pects of business can be included. The
exacting requirements of today's technol-
(Continued from page 13)
ogy will limit what can be accomplished
here unless more time is allotted to this
period in an engineer's background. The
problem is met partially by the realization
by today's students that there are other
things to be gained than the series of
grade points that lead to a diploma.
Industry is realizing some of its short-
comings and is providing an improved
framework for proper development of its
engineering talent. Most companies today
have training programs for new engineer-
ing employees. These programs vary from
brief orientation periods to extensive pro-
grams that give the new man an oppor-
tunity to become familiar with all of the
company's operations at a number of
levels. A number of companies have job
rotation programs that cover a number
of years and provide an opportunity to
function as an engineer in many phases
of the company's operations and to test
ability along many lines.
There is, I know, a conscious effort on
the part of industry to place engineering
in its proper perspective and to divorce
the engineer from the technician's work.
Industry is beginning to realize that engi-
neering results depend to a certain extent
upon the amount of time the engineer is
given to devote to creative thinking about
broad engineering problems. More cleri-
cal and technical help is being provided
and more capital in the way of research
and development. Do you know why?
Because good, well-rounded engineers
are so scarce and because it is wasteful to
fritter away their talents.
Part of every engineer's course of
sprouts will always be a period of time in
a position that could be filled by a tech-
nician. This is the jumping-off-point for
your career, where you are given an op-
portunity to apply your technical knowl-
edge and to get your feet wet in the busi-
ness of engineering. It is an important
period where you lay the groundwork for
future advancement. How long you re-
main in this stage will depend upon the
type of company you have chosen and the
manner in which you prove your ability
to proceed to broader duties. The men

will now be on your own. How well you
build on the foundation laid down by
your professors in this fine University will
no longer be conditioned by the classroom
assignment to read to the end of Chapter
22. You will have to take the whole ini-
tiative yourself, and you are, I think, go-
ing to find that the opportunities to exer-
cise that initiative are unlimited. How
you apply your drive for advancement is
just as important as the degree of its in-
tensity. If you bury yourself in your work,
you are apt to become just a better and
better technician, which is a worthy goal,
but if you wish to assume responsibilities
in the broader field of engineering and
industry, you will need to extend the
scope of your education.
Some of you will be fortunate enough
to take positions with companies that pro-
vide educational opportunities in addition
to the training programs I have mention-
ed. Cooperative programs with universi-
ties and colleges are conducted by many
of the businesses in this country. In these
cases, you will be encouraged to partici-
pate. Most of you will have to depend
upon night school and university exten-
sion courses for any extension of your
formal training. Such opportunities exist
in almost all communities, and in most
cases a broad field of subject is available
for your participation.
For some, the opportunity to take part
in special programs will present itself.
There is a growing desire by business to
aid in the development of its talent by
sending specially qualified men to schools
and colleges for further training. But
whether your future employer throws
educational opportunities in your path or
not, you can do an immense amount to
expand your own horizons by the not-so-
simple process of self-education. You are
going to need a working understanding
of accounting and finance and labor rela-
tions and the more you know about the
humanities the better off you'll be.
In the final analysis, it is your own
individual effort that will pay the high-
est dividends. You alone are the best
judge of your shortcomings. If you are
one of those who have neglected other
activities in order to dig deeper in the
search for technical knowledge, you can
begin now also to take an interest in the
affairs around you.
In this connection I should like to point
out that corporations today have altered
their position drastically with regard to
participation in civic affairs. Not so many
years ago it was considered sufficient that
a corporation met its payroll and thus
introduced bald purchasing power into
the economic bloodstream of the com-
munity. In fact, it was the general con-
sensus among businessmen that a man's
job was the sole reason for his economic
existence and that side interests damaged
his usefulness to the company. Perhaps
the growth of taxes has induced the
change in part. Certainly there are few
Lords and Ladies Bountiful available to-
day for good works—there aren't enough
wealthy people left to handle the load.
Another reason for the change in cor-
porate attitude may be the fact that to-
day's business organizations are directed
by professional managers who have rela-
tively little ownership position. These
men have sized up the situation and faced
up to the fact that people are what makes
an organization tick. All the people. And
don't you forget it, what's good for the
whole people is good for corporations.
And so, to a considerable degree, cor-
porations have done an about face and
today place great store by civic participa-
tion.
I think corporate management realizes
more and more that the concept of an
"economic man" is a fallacy. Perhaps he
never did exist except in a few material-
istic imaginations. However that may be,
today we can be sure that our society has
reached the stage where men must be
considered in terms of their aspirations,
their drives for status and a place in the
scheme of things. They want to be inte-
grated persons—not clock numbers.
What does this have to do with you?
Well, I take it that many, if not all, of
you have the potentiality to become indus-
trial leaders or teachers of men—the two
areas are really synonymous. As such, if
you make the grade, you will need to ac-
cumulate a fund of knowledge about hu-
man nature. And the higher you climb,
the more you will deal with men and the
less with things. You will find, I think,
that men do not fall into neat little pat-
terns like the periodic table and Mollier
diagrams. You will need practice in deal-
ing with all the frustrations, anxieties,
and quirks of a lot of people—and no
two the same. And one interesting and
solid way to get that practice is to engage
in community activities beyond the scope
of your calling.
I need hardly tell you that your boss
will note it well. It will indelibly stamp
you as a man interested in people. And
promotions usually go to men who are
interested in people. Why? Because bosses
deal with people. They are the tools of
their trade.
Perhaps you will be surprised and
shocked to learn that numerous companies
recently have begun to back away from
highly trained specialists when scouting
for executive timber. There is an indica-
tion that broadly trained men are more at
home with the human equation. In many
cases I suspect that is so. But I'll hazard
the guess that the best chances go to men

Better Late Than Never
Pravda, the official newspaper of the
Communist Party in Russia, claims that
plants operated under the Ministry of
Transport and Heavy Machine Building
are idle at the beginning of the month,
and then try to catch up with quotas in a
hurry, according to American Machinist.
The magazine quotes Pravda as saying,
"almost half the total monthly output is
accomplished in the last ten days."

Is Valuable Executive Training
The ever increasing demand for executive
leadership is being met successfully in many
industrial organizations by recognizing the
capacities and potentials of the design engi-
neer. The validity of this method of select-
ing company leaders is justified when you
analyze the every day problems that parallel
the designer and a company executive.
The pivotal point in your engineering
career will occur when you visualize the re-
sults of your work by observing the charac-
teristics of the finished product. The realiza-
tion is attributed to the decisions you have
made regarding the basic design of the com-
ponent parts, cost analysis and availability
of materials, production procedures adapted
to your company's manufacturing facilities,
maintenance considerations when the fin-
ished product is subjected to customer ser-
vice, and proto-type units designed for the
replacement market when the original equip-
ment reaches obsolescence. In directing the
company's overall activities, the executive is
faced with the same basic types of problems,
in addition to other duties required of him
regarding the correlation of product priori-
ties and budgetary measures.
As the design engineer becomes experi-
enced, he realizes that the academic solution
to an engineering problem does not com-
pletely satisfy all of the requirements of com-
petitive product design. In many cases the
final decisions are determined by the eco-
nomic structure relating to the proposed
design and its market potential. The achieve-
ment of creating an acceptable design de-
mands a thorough analysis as well as sound
judgement and competence from the de-
signer. These characteristics are also impor-
tant prerequisites for executive leadership.

CUTS FABRICATING COSTS
WITH WELDED STEEL
The successful industrial designer is
one who can suggest ways of cutting
the costs. That's why the engineer who
knows how to utilize savings through
welded steel finds his designs readily
accepted.
Here, for example, is how steel
design has eliminated 356 pounds of
metal in the manufacture of the base
for this machine. All former machin-
ing has been eliminated. There are no
bolted joints to cause leakage of coolant.
Cost of manufacture has been cut 20%.

mined by the frequency of the sawtooth
oscillator, is designed to be adjustable
over a range of about 5 to 15 seconds to
meet the needs of any particular controll-
ed process.
Since the controller is of the time-
proportioning type, its time of response
to a temperature change is slightly longer
than that of other types of controllers.
Also, if the total power is switched in the
control of processes having small thermal
capacities and short thermal time lags, the
temperature may cycle about the control
point. In such cases the magnitude of the
cycling can easily be minimized supplying
a portion of the required power continu-
ously and switching only the power need-
ed to compensate for any load changes in
the controlled process.
This thermostat has been used success-
fully to control a number of processes at
NBS, and experience shows that its sen-
sitivity, stability, and flexibility make it
valuable for many laboratory applications
requiring precision temperature regula-
tion. In a typical NBS application the
thermostat has for many months held
standard electric cells, immersed in an oil
m page 36)
bath, to a controlled temperature of 28°C
within ± 0.001°C.
Another use of the instrument has been
in a small electrical furnace. The typical
small heated-air oven is ordinarily difficult
to control because of its low thermal in-
ertia. Using the NBS thermostat, the tem-
perature was almost to within ±0.1 °C.

Retractable Convertible Roof
A true, hard-top convertible is in the
advanced development stage at a major
automobile company, according to Ameri-

The retractable roof rolls back and
under the passenger compartment. The
big problem is how to design the solid
roof to retract without use of hinges
which introduce water leakage problems
and detract from smooth styling; but en-
gineers say it can be done, the magazine
reports.

Three cows eat in two weeks all the
grass on two acres of land, together with
all the grass which grows there in two
weeks. Two cows eat in four weeks all
the grass on two acres of land, together
with all the grass which grows there in
the four weeks. How many cows, then,
will eat in six weeks all the grass on six
acres of land together with all the grass
which grows there in six weeks? (In this
problem it is of course understood that
the quantity of grass on each acre is
the same when the cows began to graze,
and also that the rate of growth is uni-
form during the time of grazing.)
In how many ways can nine different

times as much as what he drew with the
two-quart measure. How much did he
draw with each measure?
A coal company appointed an agent,
agreeing to pay him a salary of $265.00
for six months, all of the coal at the end
of that time and all of the profits belong
to the company. The company furnished
him with coal to the amount of $825.60
and in cash $215.00. The agent received
for coal sold $1,323.40, paid for coal
bought $937.00, paid sundry expenses
authorized by the company $129.00, paid
his own salary $265.00, paid to the
company $200.00, delivered to indigent
persons by order of the company, coal to
the amount of $13.50. At the end of the
six months the company took possession
and found coal amounting to $616.50.
The agent then paid to the company the
money belonging to them. How much did
he pay? Did the company gain or lose by
the agency and how much?
Three men A, B, C, possess a sum of

the remainder with D; C takes away all
that is left, namely z, keeps 5/6 of it, and
deposits the remainder with D. The de-
posits with D are found to belong to
A, B, C, in the proportion 3:2:1. Find
u, x, y, z.

Two men, Smith and Johnson, form a
partnership and buy a section of land.
After purchasing the land, they find that
the section is composed of two grades of
soil and decide to dissolve the partner-
ship. One soil is worth 75c per acre while
the other is worth $1.25 an acre. How
many acres does each man get, provided
Smith takes the land worth 75c per acre
and Johnson the land worth $1.25 per
acre?
Two baseball teams, presumably of

Self-Service for Spark Plugs
Coin-operated vending machines to dis-
pense such items as spark plugs, car
polish, waxes and flashlight batteries may-
soon be installed in gas stations, reports
National Petroleum News. A major oil
company believes the machines would be
ideal for turnpike stations and other high-
volume outlets.
Ductile Iron Established
Although it has been in commercial
production for only a few years, Ductile
Iron has already entered nearly every field
of engineering practice. This new ma-
terial, introduced several years ago by
International Nickel, is now produced by
over two hundred and fifty licensed foun-

How to hold a heavily-loaded
lathe spindle
in accurate alignment
This big lathe machines rolls for steel mills. The roll
is rotated by the lathe spindle and it must be machined
to very accurate dimensions. So the lathe manufac-
turer, LeBlond Machine Tool Company, mounts the
spindle on Timken® tapered roller bearings. Despite
the great weight on the spindle, the Timken bearings
hold it precisely in place—because they are made so
accurately and have such high load capacity.
Why TIMKEN* bearings have
high load capacity
This picture shows why Timken bearings have such high
capacity—the load is carried on a. full line contact between the
rollers and races in the bearing. Note also the tapered con-
struction. This permits the bearing to be tightened up (pre-
loaded, we call it) to prevent chatter in rotating parts like the
machine tool spindle above.

Coincident with its use in medical re-
search and treatment, radio-P is used in
agricultural studies" to determine the
efficiency of artificial fertilizers such as
superphosphate. Using the radio-P, it is
possible to discover a crop's intake ratio
of fertilizer P to P already in the soil.
Also determined are the amounts of fer-
tilizer used up each year and subsequently,
the period over which the fertilizer is
effective. The proper compounds and
methods of application may be studied as
well.
Much research is being done exploring
the relation among the rate of absorption
of a material by various plants, soil and
atmospheric conditions affecting this rate,
the normal metabolism of these plants
and abnormal conditions that may occur.
In this connection, we mustn't omit
mentioning the study of the effectiveness
(Continued from page 22)
of insecticides as fair game for radio-
isotopes, and extrapolating from this, the
migration and even the evolution of in-
sects and animals may be studied. As a
case in point, researches in insect evolu-
tion proved that sterile, tagged flies of a
certain variety, when released into their
own population, caused the species to de-
cline in numbers nearly to the point of
extinction.
Though the number of papers relating
to industrial applications have been far
outstripped by those published on the
use of radio-isotopes in the field of biol-
ogy, this does not mean that there are
narrow limitations to the employment of
these materials in industry. Several uses
immediately present theselves:
1) Process following in complex oper-
ations where ordinary material balances
are difficult if not impossible to calculate,
as in the tanning industry. And also to
make sampling problems vastly more
simple.
(2) Wear and lubrication studies to
determine location and rate of wear,

Obviously, an afternoon's thought
could bring out many more applications.
But a careful consideration of even these
comparatively few uses of radio-isotopes
illuminates the importance of their con-
tribution to our national product. Until
now no mention has been made of such
broad research projects as the University
of Michigan's Phoenix Project which
employs relatively huge quantities of ra-
dio-isotopes in every thought-of use.
Certainly industry should weigh with
equal importance to power the dissemina-
tion of an unavoidably produced joint
product to this power.

Machine Design is an important part of Mechanical Engineering. The reduction of man's
physical burden and the increase in his productivity has been in a large part due to the
skill and ingenuity of the men who have designed the intricate and complex machnes re-
guired in our industrial economy. As our industrial and economic systems continue to
expand, the job of the machine designer will become increasingly more important.
The Machine Design courses of the College of Engineering are intended to introduce the
students to the fundamentals of design, as well as to provide some actual practice in this work.
Course offerings cover a large field, from general machinery design to such specialized items
as gas turbines and machine tools. The knowledge and training gained in this work is useful
in all phases of Mechanical Engineering, as well as in Sales, Production, and other related
fields.

ment means you're set to start on your career. And that's
certainly worth some serious thought.
To help you decide which job to pick, you'd do well to
weigh the many reasons for choosing an engineering
career at General Motors—reasons like these:
• At GM, an engineer has a real chance to follow his
natural bent and work in the field of his choice. That's
because GM produces a variety of products — automo-
biles, trucks, Diesel engines, refrigerators, bombsights,
just to mention a few.
• At GM, you get the chance to work closely with top
engineers, sharing their knowledge and experience.
That's owing to GM's decentralization: 34 manufactur-
ing divisions, 117 plants in 57 towns and cities. Yet
each division draws upon GM's vast central research
laboratories.
• At GM, there's a congenial climate for the personal
and professional advancement of engineers. We respect
the engineering point of view, as shown by the number
of key GM executives in both divisional and top
management who began their careers as engineering
graduates on GM drafting boards.
Naturally, all this spells genuine opportunity for the
young man who has what it takes. Your College Place-
ment Office can arrange an interview for you with our
college representative. Or you can write direct to us.

Our recently published annual report to stockholders
tells more than the financial story of the progress of
Standard Oil and its subsidiary companies in 1953. Its
facts and figures also reflect the achievements of engi-
neers and chemists.
For example, the report points out that:
More new and improved products were introduced
by our company last year than in any other year
since World War II.
Our scientists developed the Ultraforming proc-
ess, a new and better catalytic reforming method
for improving the quality of the straight-run
portions of gasoline.
Three new research laboratories were completed.
More than $200 million was invested last year
in new and improved facilities. (This year and
next we expect to invest a total of about half a
billion dollars.)
This continuing program of physical expansion and
product development at Standard Oil provides many
opportunities for engineers and chemists. Men with
technical and scientific training have found great
personal and professional satisfaction in our steady
industrial advance.
Nearly a quarter of a billion dollars will be invested
during 1954 and 1955 in development of new crude
oil production and reserves.
Basic research on lubrication is one of the many activ-
ities at Standard Oil's extensive Whiting laboratories.
Almost a billion and a half dollars has been invested
in expansion and improvement of facilities since 1945.

A new Hercules plant under construction at Burlington, New Jersey, will
make the essential raw material for Canadian production of 'Terylene'—
polyester yarn. Known as dimethyl terephthalate, or DMT, this basic chem-
ical for polyester fibers will be made by an entirely new process, and will
be available eventually for plastics and other uses.

HERCULES
HELPS...
M Hercules' business today helps almost
/ ' L everyone's business. It embraces the pro-
duction of synthetic resins, cellulose products,
chemical cotton, terpene chemicals, rosin and
rosin derivatives, chlorinated products, and many
other chemical processing materials—as well as
explosives. Through close cooperative research
with its customers, Hercules has helped improve
the processing or performance of many indus-
trial and consumer products.
Hercules now offers Hercose®S (cellulose acetate sorbate), a new film-former.
Widely soluble, it can be applied as tough, flexible coatings and cured to insoluble
condition. Hercose S films have excellent resistance to heat and low temperatures.
It is another in the diverse group of Hercules cellulose chemicals offered many
industries. Write for details.

"Tk jTy experience with machinery in
J.VJ. theNavyduringthewarconvinced
me I needed a training course. There was
so much equipment on board that was a
complete mystery to me that I became
very 'training-course minded'.
"After investigating many training
courses, the one at Allis-Chalmers looked
best to me then—and still does.
"In my opinion, the variety of equip-
ment is what makes Allis-Chalmers such
a good training spot.
"No matter what industry you may be
interested in, Allis-Chalmers makes im-
portant, specialized equipment for that
industry. Electric power, steel, cement,
paper, rock products, and flour milling
industries—to name a few, are big users
of A-C equipment.
"Before starting on the Allis-Chalmers
Graduate Training Course, I thought I
would like selling, preferably technical
selling but, as is often the case, I didn't
know for sure. This course, together with
some personal guidance, helped me make
up my mind. That, too, is an important
advantage of the GTC program.

Facts You Should Know About the
Allis-Chalmers Graduate Training Course
1. It's well established, having been
started in 1904. A large percentage of
the management group are graduates
of the course.
2. The course offers a maximum of 24
months' training. Length and type of
training is individually planned.
3. The graduate engineer may choose
the kind of work he wants to do: design,
engineering, research, production, sales,
erection, service, etc.
4. He may choose the kind of power,
processing, specialized equipment or
industrial apparatus with which he will
work, such as: steam or hydraulic,
turbo-generators, circuit breakers, unit
substations, transformers, motors, con-
trol pumps, kilns, coolers, rod and ball
mills, crushers, vibrating screens, recti-
fiers, induction and dielectric heaters,
grain mills, sifters, etc.
5. He will have individual attention
and guidance in working out his train-
ing program.
6. The program has as its objective the
right job for the right man. As he gets
experience in different training loca-
tions he can alter his course of training
to match changing interests.

THE FIRST SUCCESSFUL HELICOPTER
Just two years before Pearl Harbor, Igor Sikorsky
took the controls of a weird-looking machine —
culmination of a dream of thirty years. Moments
later it rose from the ground. Though the flight
lasted only a few seconds, the VS-300 became the
first practical helicopter in the United States.
Less than six months after Pearl Harbor, the Air
Force took delivery of the first military Sikorsky.
Since then, rapid developments prove that the
helicopter, most versatile of military aircraft, has
tremendous commercial potentials.
Helicopters of the future will be the product of
tomorrow's engineers. Sikorsky is young and grow-
ing. It offers life-time opportunities to young men
who choose work where their skills and abilities will
be constantly challenged.
Perhaps you belong at Sikorsky — in the research
departments, the drafting rooms, the engineering
laboratories.
You can remember the first successful helicopter
— you may be the man to build tomorrow's! Learn
more about employment opportunities at Sikorsky

X sands of dial phones click their demands in
many central exchanges of the New York Telephone
Company.
Little meters keep careful tally of the calls. Then
the night before each bill is dated, photography
reads the up-to-the-minute totals in a fraction of
the time it could be done in any other way. Here is
an idea that offers businesses everywhere simpli-
fication in copying readings on meters, dials or
other recording instrumentation.
Photography fits this task especially well for two
reasons. It is lightning fast. It can't make a mistake.
This is another example of the ways photography
saves time, cuts costs, reduces error, improves out-
put. In large businesses-small businesses-photog-
raphy can do big jobs. In fact, today so many new
applications of photography exist that graduates
in the physical sciences and in engineering find
them valuable tools in their new occupations. Other
graduates-together with returning servicemen-
have been led to find positions with the Eastman
